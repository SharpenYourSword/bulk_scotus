As the Court has observed, \"Americans are engaged in an earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality, and practicality of physician-assisted suicide.\" <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S. 702, 735 (1997). The dispute before us is in part a product of this political and moral debate, but its resolution requires an inquiry familiar to the courts: interpreting a federal statute to determine whether executive action is authorized by, or otherwise consistent with, the enactment.</p>\n<p>In 1994, Oregon became the first State to legalize assisted suicide when voters approved a ballot measure enacting the Oregon Death With Dignity Act (ODWDA). Ore. Rev. Stat. § 127.800 <i>et seq.</i> (2003). ODWDA, which survived a 1997 ballot measure seeking its repeal, exempts from civil or criminal liability state-licensed physicians who, in compliance with the specific safeguards in ODWDA, dispense or prescribe a lethal dose of drugs upon the request of a terminally ill patient.</p>\n<p>The drugs Oregon physicians prescribe under ODWDA are regulated under a federal statute, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA or Act). 84 Stat. 1242, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 801 <i>et seq.</i> The CSA allows these particular drugs to be available only by a written prescription from a registered physician. In the ordinary course the same drugs are prescribed in smaller doses for pain alleviation.</p>\n<p>A November 9, 2001, Interpretive Rule issued by the Attorney General addresses the implementation and enforcement of the CSA with respect to ODWDA. It determines that using controlled substances to assist suicide is not a legitimate medical practice and that dispensing or prescribing them for this purpose is unlawful under the CSA. The Interpretive Rule's validity under the CSA is the issue before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*250</span> I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We turn first to the text and structure of the CSA. Enacted in 1970 with the main objectives of combating drug abuse and controlling the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances, the CSA creates a comprehensive, closed regulatory regime criminalizing the unauthorized manufacture, distribution, dispensing, and possession of substances classified in any of the Act's five schedules. <i>Gonzales</i> v. <i>Raich,</i> 545 U.S. 1, 12-13 (2005); 21 U.S.C. § 841 (2000 ed. and Supp. II); 21 U.S.C. § 844. The Act places substances in one of five schedules based on their potential for abuse or dependence, their accepted medical use, and their accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Schedule I contains the most severe restrictions on access and use, and Schedule V the least. <i>Raich, supra,</i> at 14; 21 U.S.C. § 812. Congress classified a host of substances when it enacted the CSA, but the statute permits the Attorney General to add, remove, or reschedule substances. He may do so, however, only after making particular findings, and on scientific and medical matters he is required to accept the findings of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary). These proceedings must be on the record after an opportunity for comment. See 21 U.S.C. § 811 (2000 ed. and Supp. V).</p>\n<p>The present dispute involves controlled substances listed in Schedule II, substances generally available only pursuant to a written, nonrefillable prescription by a physician. 21 U.S.C. § 829(a). A 1971 regulation promulgated by the Attorney General requires that every prescription for a controlled substance \"be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.\" 21 CFR § 1306.04(a) (2005).</p>\n<p>To prevent diversion of controlled substances with medical uses, the CSA regulates the activity of physicians. To issue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*251</span> lawful prescriptions of Schedule II drugs, physicians must \"obtain from the Attorney General a registration issued in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by him.\" 21 U.S.C. § 822(a)(2). The Attorney General may deny, suspend, or revoke this registration if, as relevant here, the physician's registration would be \"inconsistent with the public interest.\" § 824(a)(4); § 822(a)(2). When deciding whether a practitioner's registration is in the public interest, the Attorney General \"shall\" consider:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.\" § 823(f).</blockquote>\n<p>The CSA explicitly contemplates a role for the States in regulating controlled substances, as evidenced by its pre-emption provision.</p>\n<blockquote>\"No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which that provision operates . . . to the exclusion of any State law on the same subject matter which would otherwise be within the authority of the State, unless there is a positive conflict between that provision . . . and that State law so that the two cannot consistently stand together.\" § 903.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Oregon voters enacted ODWDA in 1994. For Oregon residents to be eligible to request a prescription under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*252</span> ODWDA, they must receive a diagnosis from their attending physician that they have an incurable and irreversible disease that, within reasonable medical judgment, will cause death within six months. Ore. Rev. Stat. §§ 127.815, 127.800(12) (2003). Attending physicians must also determine whether a patient has made a voluntary request, ensure a patient's choice is informed, and refer patients to counseling if they might be suffering from a psychological disorder or depression causing impaired judgment. §§ 127.815, 127.825. A second \"consulting\" physician must examine the patient and the medical record and confirm the attending physician's conclusions. § 127.800(8). Oregon physicians may dispense or issue a prescription for the requested drug, but may not administer it. §§ 127.815(1)(L), 127.880.</p>\n<p>The reviewing physicians must keep detailed medical records of the process leading to the final prescription, § 127.855, records that Oregon's Department of Human Services reviews, § 127.865. Physicians who dispense medication pursuant to ODWDA must also be registered with both the State's Board of Medical Examiners and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). § 127.815(1)(L). In 2004, 37 patients ended their lives by ingesting a lethal dose of medication prescribed under ODWDA. Oregon Dept. of Human Servs., Seventh Annual Report on Oregon's Death with Dignity Act 20 (Mar. 10, 2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In 1997, Members of Congress concerned about ODWDA invited the DEA to prosecute or revoke the CSA registration of Oregon physicians who assist suicide. They contended that hastening a patient's death is not legitimate medical practice, so prescribing controlled substances for that purpose violates the CSA. Letter from Sen. Orrin Hatch and Rep. Henry Hyde to Thomas A. Constantine (July 25, 1997), reprinted in Hearing on S. 2151 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., 2-3 (1999) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*253</span> (hereinafter Hearing). The letter received an initial, favorable response from the director of the DEA, see Letter from Thomas A. Constantine to Sen. Orrin Hatch (Nov. 5, 1997), Hearing 4-5, but Attorney General Reno considered the matter and concluded that the DEA could not take the proposed action because the CSA did not authorize it to \"displace the states as the primary regulators of the medical profession, or to override a state's determination as to what constitutes legitimate medical practice,\" Letter from Attorney General Janet Reno to Sen. Orrin Hatch, on Oregon's Death with Dignity Act (June 5, 1998), Hearing 5-6. Legislation was then introduced to grant the explicit authority Attorney General Reno found lacking; but it failed to pass. See H. R. 4006, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998); H. R. 2260, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. (1999).</p>\n<p>In 2001, John Ashcroft was appointed Attorney General. Perhaps because Mr. Ashcroft had supported efforts to curtail assisted suicide while serving as a Senator, see, <i>e. g.,</i> 143 Cong. Rec. 5589-5590 (1997) (remarks of Sen. Ashcroft), Oregon Attorney General Hardy Myers wrote him to request a meeting with Department of Justice officials should the Department decide to revisit the application of the CSA to assisted suicide. Letter of Feb. 2, 2001, App. to Brief for Patient-Respondents in Opposition 55a. Attorney General Myers received a reply letter from one of Attorney General Ashcroft's advisers writing on his behalf, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I am aware of no pending legislation in Congress that would prompt a review of the Department's interpretation of the CSA as it relates to physician-assisted suicide. Should such a review be commenced in the future, we would be happy to include your views in that review.\" Letter from Lori Sharpe (Apr. 17, 2001), <i>id.,</i> at 58a.</blockquote>\n<p>On November 9, 2001, without consulting Oregon or apparently anyone outside his Department, the Attorney General <span class=\"star-pagination\">*254</span> issued an Interpretive Rule announcing his intent to restrict the use of controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide. Incorporating the legal analysis of a memorandum he had solicited from his Office of Legal Counsel, the Attorney General ruled:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[A]ssisting suicide is not a `legitimate medical purpose' within the meaning of 21 CFR 1306.04 (2001), and that prescribing, dispensing, or administering federally controlled substances to assist suicide violates the Controlled Substances Act. Such conduct by a physician registered to dispense controlled substances may `render his registration . . . inconsistent with the public interest' and therefore subject to possible suspension or revocation under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4). The Attorney General's conclusion applies regardless of whether state law authorizes or permits such conduct by practitioners or others and regardless of the condition of the person whose suicide is assisted.\" 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (2001).</blockquote>\n<p>There is little dispute that the Interpretive Rule would substantially disrupt the ODWDA regime. Respondents contend, and petitioners do not dispute, that every prescription filled under ODWDA has specified drugs classified under Schedule II. A physician cannot prescribe the substances without DEA registration, and revocation or suspension of the registration would be a severe restriction on medical practice. Dispensing controlled substances without a valid prescription, furthermore, is a federal crime. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Moore,</i> 423 U.S. 122 (1975).</p>\n<p>In response the State of Oregon, joined by a physician, a pharmacist, and some terminally ill patients, all from Oregon, challenged the Interpretive Rule in federal court. The United States District Court for the District of Oregon entered a permanent injunction against the Interpretive Rule's enforcement.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*255</span> A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the petitions for review and held the Interpretive Rule invalid. <i>Oregon</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 368 F.3d 1118 (2004). It reasoned that, by making a medical procedure authorized under Oregon law a federal offense, the Interpretive Rule altered the \"`\"usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government\"'\" without the requisite clear statement that the CSA authorized such action. <i>Id.,</i> at 1124-1125 (quoting <i>Gregory</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991), in turn quoting <i>Atascadero State Hospital</i> v. <i>Scanlon,</i> 473 U.S. 234, 242 (1985)). The Court of Appeals held in the alternative that the Interpretive Rule could not be squared with the plain language of the CSA, which targets only conventional drug abuse and excludes the Attorney General from decisions on medical policy. 368 F.3d, at 1125-1129.</p>\n<p>We granted the Government's petition for certiorari. 543 U.S. 1145 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Executive actors often must interpret the enactments Congress has charged them with enforcing and implementing. The parties before us are in sharp disagreement both as to the degree of deference we must accord the Interpretive Rule's substantive conclusions and whether the Rule is authorized by the statutory text at all. Although balancing the necessary respect for an agency's knowledge, expertise, and constitutional office with the courts' role as interpreter of laws can be a delicate matter, familiar principles guide us. An administrative rule may receive substantial deference if it interprets the issuing agency's own ambiguous regulation. <i>Auer</i> v. <i>Robbins,</i> 519 U.S. 452, 461-463 (1997). An interpretation of an ambiguous statute may also receive substantial deference. <i>Chevron U.S. A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-845 (1984). Deference in accordance with <i>Chevron,</i> however, is warranted only \"when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*256</span> and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mead Corp.,</i> 533 U.S. 218, 226-227 (2001). Otherwise, the interpretation is \"entitled to respect\" only to the extent it has the \"power to persuade.\" <i>Skidmore</i> v. <i>Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Government first argues that the Interpretive Rule is an elaboration of one of the Attorney General's own regulations, 21 CFR § 1306.04 (2005), which requires all prescriptions be issued \"for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.\" As such, the Government says, the Interpretive Rule is entitled to considerable deference in accordance with <i>Auer.</i></p>\n<p>In our view <i>Auer</i> and the standard of deference it accords to an agency are inapplicable here. <i>Auer</i> involved a disputed interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 as applied to a class of law enforcement officers. Under regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, an exemption from overtime pay depended, in part, on whether the employees met the \"salary basis\" test. 519 U.S., at 454-455. In this Court the Secretary of Labor filed an <i>amicus</i> brief explaining why, in his view, the regulations gave exempt status to the officers. <i>Id.,</i> at 461. We gave weight to that interpretation, holding that because the applicable test was \"a creature of the Secretary's own regulations, his interpretation of it is, under our jurisprudence, controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>In <i>Auer,</i> the underlying regulations gave specificity to a statutory scheme the Secretary of Labor was charged with enforcing and reflected the considerable experience and expertise the Department of Labor had acquired over time with respect to the complexities of the Fair Labor Standards <span class=\"star-pagination\">*257</span> Act. Here, on the other hand, the underlying regulation does little more than restate the terms of the statute itself. The language the Interpretive Rule addresses comes from Congress, not the Attorney General, and the near equivalence of the statute and regulation belies the Government's argument for <i>Auer</i> deference.</p>\n<p>The Government does not suggest that its interpretation turns on any difference between the statutory and regulatory language. The CSA allows prescription of drugs only if they have a \"currently accepted medical use,\" 21 U.S.C. § 812(b); requires a \"medical purpose\" for dispensing the least controlled substances of those on the schedules, § 829(c); and, in its reporting provision, defines a \"valid prescription\" as one \"issued for a legitimate medical purpose,\" § 830(b)(3)(A)(ii). Similarly, physicians are considered to be acting as practitioners under the statute if they dispense controlled substances \"in the course of professional practice.\" § 802(21). The regulation uses the terms \"legitimate medical purpose\" and \"the course of professional practice,\" <i>ibid.,</i> but this just repeats two statutory phrases and attempts to summarize the others. It gives little or no instruction on a central issue in this case: Who decides whether a particular activity is in \"the course of professional practice\" or done for a \"legitimate medical purpose\"? Since the regulation gives no indication how to decide this issue, the Attorney General's effort to decide it now cannot be considered an interpretation of the regulation. Simply put, the existence of a parroting regulation does not change the fact that the question here is not the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute. An agency does not acquire special authority to interpret its own words when, instead of using its expertise and experience to formulate a regulation, it has elected merely to paraphrase the statutory language.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as explained below, if there is statutory authority to issue the Interpretive Rule it comes from the 1984 amendments to the CSA that gave the Attorney General authority <span class=\"star-pagination\">*258</span> to register and deregister physicians based on the public interest. The regulation was enacted before those amendments, so the Interpretive Rule cannot be justified as indicative of some intent the Attorney General had in 1971. That the current interpretation runs counter to the \"intent at the time of the regulation's promulgation\" is an additional reason why <i>Auer</i> deference is unwarranted. <i>Thomas Jefferson Univ.</i> v. <i>Shalala,</i> 512 U.S. 504, 512 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Deference under <i>Auer</i> being inappropriate, we turn to the question whether the Interpretive Rule, on its own terms, is a permissible interpretation of the CSA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Just as the Interpretive Rule receives no deference under <i>Auer,</i> neither does it receive deference under <i>Chevron.</i> If a statute is ambiguous, judicial review of administrative rulemaking often demands <i>Chevron</i> deference; and the rule is judged accordingly. All would agree, we should think, that the statutory phrase \"legitimate medical purpose\" is a generality, susceptible to more precise definition and open to varying constructions, and thus ambiguous in the relevant sense. <i>Chevron</i> deference, however, is not accorded merely because the statute is ambiguous and an administrative official is involved. To begin with, the rule must be promulgated pursuant to authority Congress has delegated to the official. <i>Mead, supra,</i> at 226-227.</p>\n<p>The Attorney General has rulemaking power to fulfill his duties under the CSA. The specific respects in which he is authorized to make rules, however, instruct us that he is not authorized to make a rule declaring illegitimate a medical standard for care and treatment of patients that is specifically authorized under state law.</p>\n<p>The starting point for this inquiry is, of course, the language of the delegation provision itself. In many cases authority is clear because the statute gives an agency broad power to enforce all provisions of the statute. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>National</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*259</span> <i>Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</i> v. <i>Brand X Internet Services,</i> 545 U.S. 967, 980 (2005) (explaining that a Federal Communications Commission regulation received <i>Chevron</i> deference because \"Congress has delegated to the Commission the authority to . . . `prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions' of the Act\" (quoting 47 U.S.C. § 201(b))); <i>Household Credit Services, Inc.</i> v. <i>Pfennig,</i> 541 U.S. 232, 238 (2004) (giving <i>Chevron</i> deference to a Federal Reserve Board regulation where \"Congress has expressly delegated to the Board the authority to prescribe regulations. . . as, in the judgment of the Board, `are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of'\" the statute (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1604(a))). The CSA does not grant the Attorney General this broad authority to promulgate rules.</p>\n<p>The CSA gives the Attorney General limited powers, to be exercised in specific ways. His rulemaking authority under the CSA is described in two provisions: (1) \"The Attorney General is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations and to charge reasonable fees relating to the registration and control of the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances and to listed chemicals,\" 21 U.S.C. § 821 (2000 ed., Supp. V); and (2) \"The Attorney General may promulgate and enforce any rules, regulations, and procedures which he may deem necessary and appropriate for the efficient execution of his functions under this subchapter,\" 21 U.S.C. § 871(b). As is evident from these sections, Congress did not delegate to the Attorney General authority to carry out or effect all provisions of the CSA. Rather, he can promulgate rules relating only to \"registration\" and \"control,\" and \"for the efficient execution of his functions\" under the statute.</p>\n<p>Turning first to the Attorney General's authority to make regulations for the \"control\" of drugs, this delegation cannot sustain the Interpretive Rule's attempt to define standards of medical practice. Control is a term of art in the CSA. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*260</span> \"As used in this subchapter,\" § 802the subchapter that includes § 821</p>\n<blockquote>\"The term `control' means to add a drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, to a schedule under part B of this subchapter, whether by transfer from another schedule or otherwise.\" § 802(5).</blockquote>\n<p>To exercise his scheduling power, the Attorney General must follow a detailed set of procedures, including requesting a scientific and medical evaluation from the Secretary. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 811, 812 (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The statute is also specific as to the manner in which the Attorney General must exercise this authority: \"Rules of the Attorney General under this subsection [regarding scheduling] shall be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the rulemaking procedures prescribed by [the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553].\" 21 U.S.C. § 811(a). The Interpretive Rule now under consideration does not concern the scheduling of substances and was not issued after the required procedures for rules regarding scheduling, so it cannot fall under the Attorney General's \"control\" authority.</p>\n<p>Even if \"control\" in § 821 were understood to signify something other than its statutory definition, it would not support the Interpretive Rule. The statutory references to \"control\" outside the scheduling context make clear that the Attorney General can establish controls \"against diversion,\" <i>e. g.,</i> § 823(a)(1), but do not give him authority to define diversion based on his view of legitimate medical practice. As explained below, the CSA's express limitations on the Attorney General's authority, and other indications from the statutory scheme, belie any notion that the Attorney General has been granted this implicit authority. Indeed, if \"control\" were given the expansive meaning required to sustain the Interpretive Rule, it would transform the carefully described <span class=\"star-pagination\">*261</span> limits on the Attorney General's authority over registration and scheduling into mere suggestions.</p>\n<p>We turn, next, to the registration provisions of the CSA. Before 1984, the Attorney General was required to register any physician who was authorized by his State. The Attorney General could only deregister a physician who falsified his application, was convicted of a felony relating to controlled substances, or had his state license or registration revoked. See 84 Stat. 1255. The CSA was amended in 1984 to allow the Attorney General to deny registration to an applicant \"if he determines that the issuance of such registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.\" 21 U.S.C. § 823(f). Registration may also be revoked or suspended by the Attorney General on the same grounds. § 824(a)(4). In determining consistency with the public interest, the Attorney General must, as discussed above, consider five factors, including: the State's recommendation; compliance with state, federal, and local laws regarding controlled substances; and public health and safety. § 823(f).</p>\n<p>The Interpretive Rule cannot be justified under this part of the statute. It does not undertake the five-factor analysis and concerns much more than registration. Nor does the Interpretive Rule on its face purport to be an application of the registration provision in § 823(f). It is, instead, an interpretation of the substantive federal law requirements (under 21 CFR § 1306.04 (2005)) for a valid prescription. It begins by announcing that assisting suicide is not a \"legitimate medical purpose\" under § 1306.04, and that dispensing controlled substances to assist a suicide violates the CSA. 66 Fed. Reg. 56608. Violation is a criminal offense, and often a felony, under 21 U.S.C. § 841 (2000 ed. and Supp. II). The Interpretive Rule thus purports to declare that using controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide is a crime, an authority that goes well beyond the Attorney General's statutory power to register or deregister.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*262</span> The Attorney General's deregistration power, of course, may carry implications for criminal enforcement because if a physician dispenses a controlled substance after he is deregistered, he violates § 841. The Interpretive Rule works in the opposite direction, however: It declares certain conduct criminal, placing in jeopardy the registration of any physician who engages in that conduct. To the extent the Interpretive Rule concerns registration, it simply states the obvious because one of the five factors the Attorney General must consider in deciding the \"public interest\" is \"[c]ompliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.\" 21 U.S.C. § 823(f)(4). The problem with the design of the Interpretive Rule is that it cannot, and does not, explain why the Attorney General has the authority to decide what constitutes an underlying violation of the CSA in the first place. The explanation the Government seems to advance is that the Attorney General's authority to decide whether a physician's actions are inconsistent with the \"public interest\" provides the basis for the Interpretive Rule.</p>\n<p>By this logic, however, the Attorney General claims extraordinary authority. If the Attorney General's argument were correct, his power to deregister necessarily would include the greater power to criminalize even the actions of registered physicians, whenever they engage in conduct he deems illegitimate. This power to criminalizeunlike his power over registration, which must be exercised only after considering five express statutory factorswould be unrestrained. It would be anomalous for Congress to have so painstakingly described the Attorney General's limited authority to deregister a single physician or schedule a single drug, but to have given him, just by implication, authority to declare an entire class of activity outside \"the course of professional practice,\" and therefore a criminal violation of the CSA. See <i>Federal Maritime Comm'n</i> v. <i>Seatrain Lines, Inc.,</i> 411 U.S. 726, 744 (1973) (\"In light of these specific <span class=\"star-pagination\">*263</span> grants of . . . authority, we are unwilling to construe the ambiguous provisions . . . to serve this purpose [of creating further authority]a purpose for which it obviously was not intended\").</p>\n<p><i>Sutton</i> v. <i>United Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 527 U.S. 471 (1999), is instructive. The statute at issue was the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which, like the CSA, divides interpretive authority among various executive actors. The Court relied on \"the terms and structure of the ADA\" to decide that neither the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), nor any other agency, had authority to define \"disability\" in the ADA. <i>Id.,</i> at 479. Specifically, the delegating provision stated that the EEOC \"shall issue regulations . . . to carry out this subchapter,\" 42 U.S.C. § 12116, and the section of the statute defining \"disability\" was in a different subchapter. The Court did not accept the idea that because \"the employment subchapter, <i>i. e., `this</i> subchapter,' includes other provisions that use the defined terms, . . . [t]he EEOC might elaborate, through regulations, on the meaning of `disability' . . . if elaboration is needed in order to `carry out' the substantive provisions of `this subchapter.'\" 527 U.S., at 514 (Breyer, J., dissenting). See also <i>Adams Fruit Co.</i> v. <i>Barrett,</i> 494 U.S. 638, 649-650 (1990) (holding that a delegation of authority to promulgate motor vehicle safety <i>\"standards\"</i> did not include the authority to decide the pre-emptive scope of the federal statute because \"[n]o such delegation regarding [the statute's] enforcement provisions is evident in the statute\").</p>\n<p>The same principle controls here. It is not enough that the terms \"public interest,\" \"public health and safety,\" and \"Federal law\" are used in the part of the statute over which the Attorney General has authority. The statutory terms \"public interest\" and \"public health\" do not call on the Attorney General, or any other executive official, to make an independent assessment of the meaning of federal law. The Attorney General did not base the Interpretive Rule on an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*264</span> application of the five-factor test generally, or the \"public health and safety\" factor specifically. Even if he had, it is doubtful the Attorney General could cite the \"public interest\" or \"public health\" to deregister a physician simply because he deemed a controversial practice permitted by state law to have an illegitimate medical purpose.</p>\n<p>As for the federal-law factor, though it does require the Attorney General to decide \"[c]ompliance\" with the law, it does not suggest that he may decide what the law says. Were it otherwise, the Attorney General could authoritatively interpret \"State\" and \"local laws,\" which are also included in 21 U.S.C. § 823(f), despite the obvious constitutional problems in his doing so. Just as he must evaluate compliance with federal law in deciding about registration, the Attorney General must as surely evaluate compliance with federal law in deciding whether to prosecute; but this does not entitle him to <i>Chevron</i> deference. See <i>Crandon</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 494 U.S. 152, 177 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (\"The Justice Department, of course, has a very specific responsibility to determine for itself what this statute means, in order to decide when to prosecute; but we have never thought that the interpretation of those charged with prosecuting criminal statutes is entitled to deference\").</p>\n<p>The limits on the Attorney General's authority to define medical standards for the care and treatment of patients bear also on the proper interpretation of § 871(b). This section allows the Attorney General to best determine how to execute \"his functions.\" It is quite a different matter, however, to say that the Attorney General can define the substantive standards of medical practice as part of his authority. To find a delegation of this extent in § 871 would put that part of the statute in considerable tension with the narrowly defined delegation concerning control and registration. It would go, moreover, against the plain language of the text to treat a delegation for the \"execution\" of his functions as a further delegation to define other functions well beyond <span class=\"star-pagination\">*265</span> the statute's specific grants of authority. When Congress chooses to delegate a power of this extent, it does so not by referring back to the administrator's functions but by giving authority over the provisions of the statute he is to interpret. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.,</i> 545 U.S. 967; <i>Household Credit Services,</i> 541 U.S. 232.</p>\n<p>The authority desired by the Government is inconsistent with the design of the statute in other fundamental respects. The Attorney General does not have the sole delegated authority under the CSA. He must instead share it with, and in some respects defer to, the Secretary, whose functions are likewise delineated and confined by the statute. The CSA allocates decisionmaking powers among statutory actors so that medical judgments, if they are to be decided at the federal level and for the limited objects of the statute, are placed in the hands of the Secretary. In the scheduling context, for example, the Secretary's recommendations on scientific and medical matters bind the Attorney General. The Attorney General cannot control a substance if the Secretary disagrees. 21 U.S.C. § 811(b). See H. R. Rep. No. 91-1444, pt. 1, p. 33 (1970) (the section \"is not intended to authorize the Attorney General to undertake or support medical and scientific research [for the purpose of scheduling], which is within the competence of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\").</p>\n<p>In a similar vein the 1970 Act's regulation of medical practice with respect to drug rehabilitation gives the Attorney General a limited role; for it is the Secretary who, after consultation with the Attorney General and national medical groups, \"determine[s] the appropriate methods of professional practice in the medical treatment of . . . narcotic addiction.\" 42 U.S.C. § 290bb-2a; see 21 U.S.C. § 823(g) (2000 ed. and Supp. II) (stating that the Attorney General shall register practitioners who dispense drugs for narcotics treatment when the Secretary has determined the applicant is qualified to treat addicts and the Attorney General has concluded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*266</span> the applicant will comply with recordkeeping and security regulations); <i>Moore,</i> 423 U.S., at 144 (noting that in enacting the addiction-treatment provisions, Congress sought to change the fact \"that `criminal prosecutions' in the past had turned on the opinions of federal prosecutors\"); H. R. Rep. No. 93-884, p. 6 (1974) (\"This section preserves the distinctions found in the [CSA] between the functions of the Attorney General and the Secretary . . . . All decisions of a medical nature are to be made by the Secretary . . . . Law enforcement decisions respecting the security of stocks of narcotic drugs and the maintenance of records on such drugs are to be made by the Attorney General\").</p>\n<p>Postenactment congressional commentary on the CSA's regulation of medical practice is also at odds with the Attorney General's claimed authority to determine appropriate medical standards. In 1978, in preparation for ratification of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, Feb. 21, 1971, [1979-1980] 32 U.S. T. 543, T. I. A. S. No. 9725, Congress decided it would implement the United States' compliance through \"the framework of the procedures and criteria for classification of substances provided in the\" CSA. 21 U.S.C. § 801a(3). It did so to ensure that \"nothing in the Convention will interfere with ethical medical practice in this country as determined by [the Secretary] on the basis of a consensus of the views of the American medical and scientific community.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The structure of the CSA, then, conveys unwillingness to cede medical judgments to an executive official who lacks medical expertise. In interpreting statutes that divide authority, the Court has recognized: \"Because historical familiarity and policymaking expertise account in the first instance for the presumption that Congress delegates interpretive lawmaking power to the agency rather than to the reviewing court, we presume here that Congress intended to invest interpretive power in the administrative actor in the best position to develop these attributes.\" <i>Martin</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> v. <i>Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n,</i> 499 U.S. 144, 153 (1991) (citations omitted). This presumption works against a conclusion that the Attorney General has authority to make quintessentially medical judgments.</p>\n<p>The Government contends the Attorney General's decision here is a legal, not a medical, one. This generality, however, does not suffice. The Attorney General's Interpretive Rule, and the Office of Legal Counsel memo it incorporates, place extensive reliance on medical judgments and the views of the medical community in concluding that assisted suicide is not a \"legitimate medical purpose.\" See 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (noting the \"medical\" distinctions between assisting suicide and giving sufficient medication to alleviate pain); Memorandum from Office of Legal Counsel to Attorney General (June 27, 2001), App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a-122a, and n. 17 (discussing the \"Federal medical policy\" against physician-assisted suicide), <i>id.,</i> at 124a-130a (examining views of the medical community). This confirms that the authority claimed by the Attorney General is both beyond his expertise and incongruous with the statutory purposes and design.</p>\n<p>The idea that Congress gave the Attorney General such broad and unusual authority through an implicit delegation in the CSA's registration provision is not sustainable. \"Congress, we have held, does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisionsit does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\" <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.,</i> 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001); see <i>FDA</i> v. <i>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> 529 U.S. 120, 160 (2000) (\"[W]e are confident that Congress could not have intended to delegate a decision of such economic and political significance to an agency in so cryptic a fashion\").</p>\n<p>The importance of the issue of physician-assisted suicide, which has been the subject of an \"earnest and profound debate\" across the country, <i>Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S., at 735, makes the oblique form of the claimed delegation all the more suspect. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> Under the Government's theory, moreover, the medical judgments the Attorney General could make are not limited to physician-assisted suicide. Were this argument accepted, he could decide whether any particular drug may be used for any particular purpose, or indeed whether a physician who administers any controversial treatment could be deregistered. This would occur, under the Government's view, despite the statute's express limitation of the Attorney General's authority to registration and control, with attendant restrictions on each of those functions, and despite the statutory purposes to combat drug abuse and prevent illicit drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>We need not decide whether <i>Chevron</i> deference would be warranted for an interpretation issued by the Attorney General concerning matters closer to his role under the CSA, namely, preventing doctors from engaging in illicit drug trafficking. In light of the foregoing, however, the CSA does not give the Attorney General authority to issue the Interpretive Rule as a statement with the force of law.</p>\n<p>If, in the course of exercising his authority, the Attorney General uses his analysis in the Interpretive Rule only for guidance in deciding when to prosecute or deregister, then the question remains whether his substantive interpretation is correct. Since the Interpretive Rule was not promulgated pursuant to the Attorney General's authority, its interpretation of \"legitimate medical purpose\" does not receive <i>Chevron</i> deference. Instead, it receives deference only in accordance with <i>Skidmore.</i> \"The weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\" 323 U.S., at 140; see also <i>Mead,</i> 533 U.S., at 235 (noting that an opinion receiving <i>Skidmore</i> deference may \"claim the merit of its writer's thoroughness, logic, and expertness, its fit with prior interpretations, and any other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*269</span> sources of weight\"). The deference here is tempered by the Attorney General's lack of expertise in this area and the apparent absence of any consultation with anyone outside the Department of Justice who might aid in a reasoned judgment. In any event, under <i>Skidmore,</i> we follow an agency's rule only to the extent it is persuasive, see <i>Christensen</i> v. <i>Harris County,</i> 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000); and for the reasons given and for further reasons set out below, we do not find the Attorney General's opinion persuasive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>As we have noted before, the CSA \"repealed most of the earlier antidrug laws in favor of a comprehensive regime to combat the international and interstate traffic in illicit drugs.\" <i>Raich,</i> 545 U.S., at 12. In doing so, Congress sought to \"conquer drug abuse and to control the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It comes as little surprise, then, that we have not considered the extent to which the CSA regulates medical practice beyond prohibiting a doctor from acting as a drug \"`pusher'\" instead of a physician. <i>Moore,</i> 423 U.S., at 143. In <i>Moore,</i> we addressed a situation in which a doctor \"sold drugs, not for legitimate purposes, but primarily for the profits to be derived therefrom.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 135 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 91-1444, pt. 1, at 10; internal quotation marks omitted). There the defendant, who had engaged in large-scale over-prescribing of methadone, \"concede[d] in his brief that he did not observe generally accepted medical practices.\" 423 U.S., at 126. And in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative,</i> 532 U.S. 483 (2001), Congress' express determination that marijuana had no accepted medical use foreclosed any argument about statutory coverage of drugs available by a doctor's prescription.</p>\n<p>In deciding whether the CSA can be read as prohibiting physician-assisted suicide, we look to the statute's text and design. The statute and our case law amply support the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*270</span> conclusion that Congress regulates medical practice insofar as it bars doctors from using their prescription-writing powers as a means to engage in illicit drug dealing and trafficking as conventionally understood. Beyond this, however, the statute manifests no intent to regulate the practice of medicine generally. The silence is understandable given the structure and limitations of federalism, which allow the States \"`great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.'\" <i>Medtronic, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lohr,</i> 518 U.S. 470, 475 (1996) (quoting <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 471 U.S. 724, 756 (1985)).</p>\n<p>The structure and operation of the CSA presume and rely upon a functioning medical profession regulated under the States' police powers. The Attorney General can register a physician to dispense controlled substances \"if the applicant is authorized to dispense . . . controlled substances under the laws of the State in which he practices.\" 21 U.S.C. § 823(f). When considering whether to revoke a physician's registration, the Attorney General looks not just to violations of federal drug laws; but he \"shall\" also consider \"[t]he recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority\" and the registrant's compliance with state and local drug laws. <i>Ibid.</i> The very definition of a \"practitioner\" eligible to prescribe includes physicians \"licensed, registered, or otherwise permitted, by the United States or the jurisdiction in which he practices\" to dispense controlled substances. § 802(21). Further cautioning against the conclusion that the CSA effectively displaces the States' general regulation of medical practice is the Act's pre-emption provision, which indicates that, absent a positive conflict, none of the Act's provisions should be \"construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which that provision operates . . . to the exclusion of any State law on the same subject matter <span class=\"star-pagination\">*271</span> which would otherwise be within the authority of the State.\" § 903.</p>\n<p>Oregon's regime is an example of the state regulation of medical practice that the CSA presupposes. Rather than simply decriminalizing assisted suicide, ODWDA limits its exercise to the attending physicians of terminally ill patients, physicians who must be licensed by Oregon's Board of Medical Examiners. Ore. Rev. Stat. §§ 127.815, 127.800(10) (2003). The statute gives attending physicians a central role, requiring them to provide prognoses and prescriptions, give information about palliative alternatives and counseling, and ensure patients are competent and acting voluntarily. § 127.815. Any eligible patient must also get a second opinion from another registered physician, § 127.820, and the statute's safeguards require physicians to keep and submit to inspection detailed records of their actions, §§ 127.855, 127.865.</p>\n<p>Even though regulation of health and safety is \"primarily, and historically, a matter of local concern,\" <i>Hillsborough County</i> v. <i>Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,</i> 471 U.S. 707, 719 (1985), there is no question that the Federal Government can set uniform national standards in these areas. See <i>Raich, supra,</i> at 9. In connection to the CSA, however, we find only one area in which Congress set general, uniform standards of medical practice. Title I of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, of which the CSA was Title II, provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[The Secretary], after consultation with the Attorney General and with national organizations representative of persons with knowledge and experience in the treatment of narcotic addicts, shall determine the appropriate methods of professional practice in the medical treatment of the narcotic addiction of various classes of narcotic addicts, and shall report thereon from time to time to the Congress.\" § 4, 84 Stat. 1241, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 290bb-2a.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*272</span> This provision strengthens the understanding of the CSA as a statute combating recreational drug abuse, and also indicates that when Congress wants to regulate medical practice in the given scheme, it does so by explicit language in the statute.</p>\n<p>In the face of the CSA's silence on the practice of medicine generally and its recognition of state regulation of the medical profession it is difficult to defend the Attorney General's declaration that the statute impliedly criminalizes physician-assisted suicide. This difficulty is compounded by the CSA's consistent delegation of medical judgments to the Secretary and its otherwise careful allocation of powers for enforcing the limited objects of the CSA. See Part II-B, <i>supra.</i> The Government's attempt to meet this challenge rests, for the most part, on the CSA's requirement that every Schedule II drug be dispensed pursuant to a \"written prescription of a practitioner.\" 21 U.S.C. § 829(a). A prescription, the Government argues, necessarily implies that the substance is being made available to a patient for a legitimate medical purpose. The statute, in this view, requires an anterior judgment about the term \"medical\" or \"medicine.\" The Government contends ordinary usage of these words ineluctably refers to a healing or curative art, which by these terms cannot embrace the intentional hastening of a patient's death. It also points to the teachings of Hippocrates, the positions of prominent medical organizations, the Federal Government, and the judgment of the 49 States that have not legalized physician-assisted suicide as further support for the proposition that the practice is not legitimate medicine. See Brief for Petitioners 22-24; Memorandum from Office of Legal Counsel to Attorney General, App. to Pet. for Cert. 124a-130a.</p>\n<p>On its own, this understanding of medicine's boundaries is at least reasonable. The primary problem with the Government's argument, however, is its assumption that the CSA <span class=\"star-pagination\">*273</span> impliedly authorizes an executive officer to bar a use simply because it may be inconsistent with one reasonable understanding of medical practice. Viewed alone, the prescription requirement may support such an understanding, but statutes \"should not be read as a series of unrelated and isolated provisions.\" <i>Gustafson</i> v. <i>Alloyd Co.,</i> 513 U.S. 561, 570 (1995). The CSA's substantive provisions and their arrangement undermine this assertion of an expansive federal authority to regulate medicine.</p>\n<p>The statutory criteria for deciding what substances are controlled, determinations which are central to the Act, consistently connect the undefined term \"drug abuse\" with addiction or abnormal effects on the nervous system. When the Attorney General schedules drugs, he must consider a substance's psychic or physiological dependence liability. 21 U.S.C. § 811(c)(7). To classify a substance in Schedules II through V, the Attorney General must find abuse of the drug leads to psychological or physical dependence. § 812(b). Indeed, the differentiation of Schedules II through V turns in large part on a substance's habit-forming potential: The more addictive a substance, the stricter the controls. <i>Ibid.</i> When Congress wanted to extend the CSA's regulation to substances not obviously habit forming or psychotropic, moreover, it relied not on executive ingenuity, but rather on specific legislation. See § 1902(a) of the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 4851 (placing anabolic steroids in Schedule III).</p>\n<p>The statutory scheme with which the CSA is intertwined further confirms a more limited understanding of the prescription requirement. When the Secretary considers Food and Drug Administration approval of a substance with \"stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect,\" he must forward the information to the Attorney General for possible scheduling. Shedding light on Congress' understanding of drug abuse, this requirement appears under the heading \"Abuse <span class=\"star-pagination\">*274</span> potential.\" 21 U.S.C. § 811(f). Similarly, when Congress prepared to implement the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, it did so through the CSA. § 801a.</p>\n<p>The Interpretive Rule rests on a reading of the prescription requirement that is persuasive only to the extent one scrutinizes the provision without the illumination of the rest of the statute. See <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Morash,</i> 490 U.S. 107, 114-115 (1989). Viewed in its context, the prescription requirement is better understood as a provision that ensures patients use controlled substances under the supervision of a doctor so as to prevent addiction and recreational abuse. As a corollary, the provision also bars doctors from peddling to patients who crave the drugs for those prohibited uses. See <i>Moore,</i> 423 U.S., at 135, 143. To read prescriptions for assisted suicide as constituting \"drug abuse\" under the CSA is discordant with the phrase's consistent use throughout the statute, not to mention its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p>The Government's interpretation of the prescription requirement also fails under the objection that the Attorney General is an unlikely recipient of such broad authority, given the Secretary's primacy in shaping medical policy under the CSA, and the statute's otherwise careful allocation of decisionmaking powers. Just as the conventions of expression indicate that Congress is unlikely to alter a statute's obvious scope and division of authority through muffled hints, the background principles of our federal system also belie the notion that Congress would use such an obscure grant of authority to regulate areas traditionally supervised by the States' police power. It is unnecessary even to consider the application of clear statement requirements, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Bass,</i> 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971); cf. <i>BFP</i> v. <i>Resolution Trust Corporation,</i> 511 U.S. 531, 544-546 (1994), or presumptions against pre-emption, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Rush Prudential HMO, Inc.</i> v. <i>Moran,</i> 536 U.S. 355, 387 (2002), to reach this commonsense conclusion. For all these reasons, we conclude the CSA's prescription requirement does not authorize <span class=\"star-pagination\">*275</span> the Attorney General to bar dispensing controlled substances for assisted suicide in the face of a state medical regime permitting such conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The Government, in the end, maintains that the prescription requirement delegates to a single executive officer the power to effect a radical shift of authority from the States to the Federal Government to define general standards of medical practice in every locality. The text and structure of the CSA show that Congress did not have this far-reaching intent to alter the federal-state balance and the congressional role in maintaining it.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court concludes that the Attorney General lacked authority to declare assisted suicide illicit under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), because the CSA is concerned only with \"<i>illicit</i> drug dealing and trafficking,\" <i>ante,</i> at 270 (emphasis added). This question-begging conclusion is obscured by a flurry of arguments that distort the statute and disregard settled principles of our interpretive jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the Court's analysis, this case involves not one but <i>three</i> independently sufficient grounds for reversing the Ninth Circuit's judgment. First, the Attorney General's interpretation of \"legitimate medical purpose\" in 21 CFR § 1306.04 (2005) (hereinafter Regulation) is clearly valid, given the substantial deference we must accord it under <i>Auer</i> v. <i>Robbins,</i> 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997), and his two remaining conclusions follow naturally from this interpretation. See Part I, <i>infra.</i> Second, even if this interpretation of the Regulation is entitled to lesser deference or no deference <span class=\"star-pagination\">*276</span> at all, it is by far the most natural interpretation of the Regulationwhose validity is not challenged here. This interpretation is thus correct even upon <i>de novo</i> review. See Part II, <i>infra.</i> Third, even if that interpretation of the Regulation were incorrect, the Attorney General's independent interpretation of the <i>statutory</i> phrase \"public interest\" in 21 U.S.C. §§ 824(a) and 823(f), and his implicit interpretation of the statutory phrase \"public health and safety\" in § 823(f)(5), are entitled to deference under <i>Chevron U.S. A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837 (1984), and they are valid under <i>Chevron.</i> See Part III, <i>infra.</i> For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Interpretive Rule issued by the Attorney General (hereinafter Directive) provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"For the reasons set forth in the OLC Opinion, I hereby determine that assisting suicide is not a `legitimate medical purpose' within the meaning of 21 CFR § 1306.04 (2001), and that prescribing, dispensing, or administering federally controlled substances to assist suicide violates the CSA. Such conduct by a physician registered to dispense controlled substances may `render his registration . . . inconsistent with the public interest' and therefore subject to possible suspension or revocation under 21 U.S.C. [§] 824(a)(4).\" 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (2001).</blockquote>\n<p>The Directive thus purports to do three distinct things: (1) to interpret the phrase \"legitimate medical purpose\" in the Regulation to exclude physician-assisted suicide; (2) to determine that prescribing, dispensing, and administering federally controlled substances to assist suicide violates the CSA; and (3) to determine that participating in physician-assisted suicide may render a practitioner's registration \"inconsistent with the public interest\" within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. §§ 823(f) and 824(a)(4) (which incorporates § 823(f) by reference). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*277</span> The Court's analysis suffers from an unremitting failure to distinguish among these distinct propositions in the Directive.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the validity of the Regulation's interpretation of \"prescription\" in § 829 to require a \"legitimate medical purpose\" is not at issue. Respondents conceded the validity of this interpretation in the lower court, see <i>Oregon</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 368 F.3d 1118, 1133 (CA9 2004), and they have not challenged it here. By its assertion that the Regulation merely restates the statutory standard of 21 U.S.C. § 830(b)(3)(A)(ii), see <i>ante,</i> at 257, the Court likewise accepts that the \"legitimate medical purpose\" interpretation for prescriptions is proper. See also <i>ante,</i> at 258 (referring to \"legitimate medical purpose\" as a \"statutory phrase\"). It is beyond dispute, then, that a \"prescription\" under § 829 must issue for a \"legitimate medical purpose.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Because the Regulation was promulgated by the Attorney General, and because the Directive purported to interpret the language of the Regulation, see 66 Fed. Reg. 56608, this case calls for the straightforward application of our rule that an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is \"controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" <i>Auer, supra,</i> at 461 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court reasons that <i>Auer</i> is inapplicable because the Regulation \"does little more than restate the terms of the statute itself.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 257. \"Simply put,\" the Court asserts, \"the existence of a parroting regulation does not change the fact that the question here is not the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>To begin with, it is doubtful that any such exception to the <i>Auer</i> rule exists. The Court cites no authority for it, because there is none. To the contrary, our unanimous decision in <i>Auer</i> makes clear that broadly drawn regulations are entitled to no less respect than narrow ones. \"A rule requiring <span class=\"star-pagination\">*278</span> the Secretary to construe his own regulations narrowly would make little sense, <i>since he is free to write the regulations as broadly as he wishes, subject only to the limits imposed by the statute.\"</i> 519 U.S., at 463 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Even if there were an antiparroting canon, however, it would have no application here. The Court's description of 21 CFR § 1306.04 (2005) as a regulation that merely \"paraphrase[s] the statutory language,\" <i>ante,</i> at 257, is demonstrably false. In relevant part, the Regulation interprets the word \"prescription\" as it appears in 21 U.S.C. § 829, which governs the dispensation of controlled substances other than those on Schedule I (which may not be dispensed at all). Entitled \"[p]rescriptions,\" § 829 requires, with certain exceptions not relevant here, \"the written prescription of a practitioner\" (usually a medical doctor) for the dispensation of Schedule II substances (§ 829(a)), \"a written or oral prescription\" for substances on Schedules III and IV (§ 829(b)), and no prescription but merely a \"medical purpose\" for the dispensation of Schedule V substances (§ 829(c)).</p>\n<p>As used in this section, \"prescription\" is susceptible of at least three reasonable interpretations. First, it might mean any oral or written direction of a practitioner for the dispensation of drugs. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Moore,</i> 423 U.S. 122, 137, n. 13 (1975) (\"On its face § 829 addresses only the form that a prescription must take. . . . [Section] 829 by its terms does not limit the authority of a practitioner\"). Second, in light of the requirement of a \"medical purpose\" for the dispensation of Schedule V substances, see § 829(c), it might mean a practitioner's oral or written direction for the dispensation of drugs that the practitioner believes to be for a legitimate medical purpose. See Webster's New International Dictionary 1954 (2d ed. 1950) (hereinafter Webster's Second) (defining \"prescription\" as \"[a] written direction for the preparation and use of a <i>medicine</i>\"); <i>id.,</i> at 1527 (defining \"medicine\" as \"[a]ny substance or preparation used in <i>treating disease</i>\") (emphasis added). Finally, \"prescription\" might <span class=\"star-pagination\">*279</span> refer to a practitioner's direction for the dispensation of drugs that serves an <i>objectively</i> legitimate medical purpose, regardless of the practitioner's <i>subjective</i> judgment about the legitimacy of the anticipated use. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Regulation at issue constricts or clarifies the statute by adopting the last and narrowest of these three possible interpretations of the undefined statutory term: \"A prescription for a controlled substance to be effective must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose . . . .\" 21 CFR § 1306.04(a) (2005). We have previously <i>acknowledged</i> that the Regulation gives added content to the text of the statute: \"The medical purpose requirement explicit in subsection (c) [of § 829] could be implicit in subsections (a) and (b). Regulation § [1]306.04 makes it explicit.\" <i>Moore, supra,</i> at 137, n. 13.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court points out that the Regulation adopts some of the phrasing employed in unrelated sections of the statute. See <i>ante,</i> at 257. This is irrelevant. A regulation that significantly clarifies the meaning of an otherwise ambiguous statutory provision is not a \"parroting\" regulation, <i>regardless</i> of the sources that the agency draws upon for the clarification. Moreover, most of the statutory phrases that the Court cites as appearing in the Regulation, see <i>ibid.</i> (citing 21 U.S.C. §§ 812(b) (\"`currently accepted medical use'\"), 829(c) (\"`medical purpose'\"), 802(21) (\"`in the course of professional practice'\")), are inapposite because they do <i>not</i> \"parrot\" the <i>only</i> phrase in the Regulation that the Directive purported to construe. See 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (\"I hereby <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> determine that assisting suicide is not a `legitimate medical purpose' within the meaning of 21 CFR § 1306.04 . . .\"). None of them includes the key word \"legitimate,\" which gives the most direct support to the Directive's theory that § 829(c) presupposes a uniform federal standard of medical practice.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Since the Regulation does not run afowl (so to speak) of the Court's newly invented prohibition of \"parroting\"; and since the Directive represents the agency's own interpretation of that concededly valid regulation; the only question remaining is whether that interpretation is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\"; otherwise, it is \"controlling.\" <i>Auer,</i> 519 U.S., at 461 (internal quotation marks omitted). This is not a difficult question. The Directive is assuredly valid insofar as it interprets \"prescription\" to require a medical purpose that is \"legitimate\" as a matter of <i>federal</i> lawsince that is an interpretation of \"prescription\" that we ourselves have adopted. <i>Webb</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 249 U.S. 96 (1919), was a prosecution under the Harrison Act of a doctor who wrote prescriptions of morphine \"for the purpose of providing the user with morphine sufficient to keep him comfortable by maintaining his customary use,\" <i>id.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span> at 99 (internal quotation marks omitted). The dispositive issue in the case was whether such authorizations were \"prescriptions\" within the meaning of § 2(b) of the Harrison Act, predecessor to the CSA. <i>Ibid.</i> We held that \"to call such an order for the use of morphine a physician's prescription would be so plain a perversion of meaning that no discussion of the subject is required.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 99-100. Like the Directive, this interprets \"prescription\" to require medical purpose that is legitimate as a matter of federal law. And the Directive is also assuredly valid insofar as it interprets \"legitimate medical purpose\" as a matter of federal law to exclude physician-assisted suicide, because that is not only a permissible but indeed the most natural interpretation of that phrase. See Part II, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Even if the Regulation merely parroted the statute, and the Directive therefore had to be treated as though it construed the statute directly, see <i>ante,</i> at 257, the Directive would still be entitled to deference under <i>Chevron.</i> The Court does not take issue with the Solicitor General's contention that no alleged procedural defect, such as the absence of notice-and-comment rulemaking before promulgation of the Directive, renders <i>Chevron</i> inapplicable here. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 4 (citing <i>Barnhart</i> v. <i>Walton,</i> 535 U.S. 212, 219-222 (2002); 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(A) (exempting interpretive rules from notice-and-comment rulemaking)). Instead, the Court holds that the Attorney General lacks interpretive authority to issue the Directive at all, on the ground that the explicit delegation provision, 21 U.S.C. § 821 (2000 ed., Supp. V), limits his rulemaking authority to \"registration and control,\" which (according to the Court) are not implicated by the Directive's interpretation of the prescription requirement. See <i>ante,</i> at 259-262.</p>\n<p>Setting aside the implicit delegation inherent in Congress's use of the undefined term \"prescription\" in § 829, the Court's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> reading of \"control\" in § 821 is manifestly erroneous. The Court urges, <i>ante,</i> at 260, that \"control\" is a term defined in part A of the subchapter (entitled \"Introductory Provisions\") to mean \"to add a drug or other substance . . . to a schedule <i>under part B of this subchapter,</i>\" 21 U.S.C. § 802(5) (emphasis added). But § 821 is not included in \"part B of this subchapter,\" which is entitled \"Authority to Control; Standards and Schedules,\" and consists of the sections related to <i>scheduling,</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 811-814 (2000 ed. and Supp. V), where the statutory definition is uniquely appropriate. Rather, § 821 is found in <i>part C</i> of the subchapter, §§ 821-830, entitled \"Registration of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dispensers of Controlled Substances,\" which includes all and only the provisions relating to the \"manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances,\" § 821. The artificial definition of \"control\" in § 802(5) has no conceivable application to the use of that word in § 821. Under that definition, \"control\" must take a <i>substance</i> as its direct object, see 21 U.S.C. § 802(5) (\"to add a drug or other substance . . . to a schedule\")and that is how \"control\" is consistently used throughout <i>part B.</i> See, <i>e. g.,</i> §§ 811(b) (\"proceedings . . . to <i>control</i> a drug or other substance\"), 811(c) (\"each drug or other substance proposed to be <i>controlled</i> or removed from the schedules\"), 811(d)(1) (\"If <i>control</i> is required . . . the Attorney General shall issue an order <i>controlling</i> such drug . . .\"), 812(b) (\"Except where <i>control</i> is required . . . a drug or other substance may not be placed in any schedule . . .\"). In § 821, by contrast, the term \"control\" has as its object, not \"a drug or other substance,\" but rather the <i>processes</i> of \"manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances.\" It could not be clearer that the artificial definition of \"control\" in § 802(5) is inapplicable. It makes no sense to speak of \"adding the manufacturing, distribution, and dispensing of substances to a schedule.\" We do not force term-of-art definitions into contexts where they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense. What <span class=\"star-pagination\">*283</span> is obviously intended in § 821 is the ordinary meaning of \"control\"namely, \"[t]o exercise restraining or directing influence over; to dominate; regulate; hence, to hold from action; to curb,\" Webster's Second 580. \"Control\" is regularly used in this ordinary sense elsewhere in <i>part C</i> of the subchapter. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 823(a)(1), (b)(1), (d)(1), (e)(1), (h)(1) (\"maintenance of effective <i>controls</i> against diversion\"); §§ 823(a)(5), (d)(5) (\"establishment of effective <i>control</i> against diversion\"); § 823(g)(2)(H)(i) (\"to exercise supervision or <i>control</i> over the practice of medicine\"); § 830(b)(1)(C) (\"a listed chemical under the <i>control</i> of the regulated person\"); § 830(c)(2)(D) (\"chemical <i>control</i> laws\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>When the word is given its ordinary meaning, the Attorney General's interpretation of the prescription requirement of § 829 plainly \"relat[es] to the . . . <i>control</i> of the . . . dispensing of controlled substances,\" 21 U.S.C. § 821 (2000 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added), since a prescription is the chief requirement for \"dispensing\" such drugs, see § 829. The same meaning is compelled by the fact that § 821 is the first section not of part B of the subchapter, which deals entirely with \"control\" in the artificial sense, but of part C, every section of which relates to the \"registration and control of the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances,\" § 821. See §§ 822 (persons required to register), 823 (registration requirements), 824 (denial, revocation, or suspension of registration), 825 (labeling and packaging), 826 (production quotas for controlled substances), 827 (recordkeeping and reporting requirements of registrants), 828 (order forms), 829 (prescription requirements), 830 (regulation of listed chemicals and certain machines). It would be peculiar for the first section of this part to authorize rulemaking for matters covered by the <i>previous</i> part. The only sensible interpretation of § 821 is that it gives the Attorney General interpretive authority over the provisions of part C, all of which \"relat[e] to the registration and control of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances.\" These provisions include <i>both</i> the prescription requirement of § 829, and the criteria for registration and deregistration of §§ 823 and 824 (as relevant below, see Part III, <i>infra</i>).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In sum, the Directive's construction of \"legitimate medical purpose\" is a perfectly valid agency interpretation of its own regulation; and if not that, a perfectly valid agency interpretation of the statute. No one contends that the construction is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,\" <i>Bowles</i> v. <i>Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.,</i> 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945), or beyond the scope of ambiguity in the statute, see <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S., at 843. In fact, as explained below, the Directive provides <i>the most natural</i> interpretation of the Regulation and of the statute. The Directive thus definitively establishes that a doctor's order authorizing the dispensation of a Schedule II substance for the purpose of assisting a suicide is not a \"prescription\" within the meaning of § 829.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> Once this conclusion is established, the other two conclusions in the Directive follow inevitably. Under our reasoning in <i>Moore,</i> writing prescriptions that are illegitimate under § 829 is certainly not \"in the [usual] course of professional practice\" under § 802(21) and thus not \"authorized by this subchapter\" under § 841(a). See 423 U.S., at 138, 140-141. A doctor who does this may thus be prosecuted under § 841(a), and so it follows that such conduct \"violates the Controlled Substances Act,\" 66 Fed. Reg. 56608. And since such conduct is thus not in \"[c]ompliance with applicable . . . Federal . . . laws relating to controlled substances,\" 21 U.S.C. § 823(f)(4), and may also be fairly judged to \"threaten the public health and safety,\" § 823(f)(5), it follows that \"[s]uch conduct by a physician registered to dispense controlled substances <i>may</i> `render his registration . . . inconsistent with the public interest' and therefore subject to <i>possible</i> suspension or revocation under 21 U.S.C. [§] 824(a)(4),\" 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Even if the Directive were entitled to no deference whatever, the most reasonable interpretation of the Regulation and of the statute would produce the same result. Virtually every relevant source of authoritative meaning confirms that the phrase \"legitimate medical purpose\"<sup>[4]</sup> does not include intentionally assisting suicide. \"Medicine\" refers to \"[t]he science and art dealing with the prevention, cure, or alleviation of disease.\" Webster's Second 1527. The use of the word \"legitimate\" connotes an <i>objective</i> standard of \"medicine,\" and our presumption that the CSA creates a uniform federal law regulating the dispensation of controlled substances, see <i>Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians</i> v. <i>Holyfield,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> 490 U.S. 30, 43 (1989), means that this objective standard must be a federal one. As recounted in detail in the memorandum for the Attorney General that is attached as an appendix to the Directive (OLC Memo), virtually every medical authority from Hippocrates to the current American Medical Association (AMA) confirms that assisting suicide has seldom or never been viewed as a form of \"prevention, cure, or alleviation of disease,\" and (even more so) that assisting suicide is not a \"legitimate\" branch of that \"science and art.\" See OLC Memo, App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a-130a. Indeed, the AMA has determined that \"`[p]hysician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.'\" <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S. 702, 731 (1997). \"[T]he overwhelming weight of authority in judicial decisions, the past and present policies of nearly all of the States and of the Federal Government, and the clear, firm and unequivocal views of the leading associations within the American medical and nursing professions, establish that assisting in suicide . . . is not a legitimate medical purpose.\" OLC Memo, <i>supra,</i> at 129a. See also <i>Glucksberg, supra,</i> at 710, n. 8 (prohibitions or condemnations of assisted suicide in 50 jurisdictions, including 47 States, the District of Columbia, and 2 Territories).</p>\n<p>In the face of this \"overwhelming weight of authority,\" the Court's admission that \"[o]n its own, this understanding of medicine's boundaries is <i>at least reasonable,\" ante,</i> at 272 (emphasis added), tests the limits of understatement. The only explanation for such a distortion is that the Court confuses the <i>normative</i> inquiry of what the boundaries of medicine <i>should be</i>which it is laudably hesitant to undertake with the <i>objective</i> inquiry of what the accepted definition of \"medicine\" <i>is.</i> The same confusion is reflected in the Court's remarkable statement that \"[t]he primary problem with the Government's argument . . . is its assumption that the CSA impliedly authorizes an executive officer to bar a use simply <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> because it may be inconsistent with <i>one reasonable understanding</i> of medical practice.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 272-273 (emphasis added). The fact that many in Oregon believe that the boundaries of \"legitimate medicine\" <i>should be</i> extended to include assisted suicide does not change the fact that the overwhelming weight of authority (including the 47 States that condemn physician-assisted suicide) confirms that they have not yet been so extended. Not even those of our Eighth Amendment cases most generous in discerning an \"evolution\" of national standards would have found, on this record, that the concept of \"legitimate medicine\" has evolved so far. See <i>Roper</i> v. <i>Simmons,</i> 543 U.S. 551, 564-567 (2005).</p>\n<p>The Court contends that the phrase \"legitimate medical purpose\" <i>cannot</i> be read to establish a broad, uniform federal standard for the medically proper use of controlled substances. <i>Ante,</i> at 268. But it also rejects the most plausible alternative proposition, urged by the State, that any use authorized under state law constitutes a \"legitimate medical purpose.\" (The Court is perhaps leery of embracing this position because the State candidly admitted at oral argument that, on its view, a State could exempt from the CSA's coverage the use of morphine to achieve euphoria.) Instead, the Court reverse-engineers an approach somewhere between a uniform national standard and a state-by-state approach, holding (with no basis in the CSA's text) that \"legitimate medical purpose\" refers to <i>all</i> uses of drugs unrelated to \"addiction and recreational abuse.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 274. Thus, though the Court pays lipservice to state autonomy, see <i>ante,</i> at 269-271, its standard for \"legitimate medical purpose\" is in fact a hazily defined <i>federal</i> standard based on its purposive reading of the CSA, and extracted from obliquely relevant sections of the Act. In particular, relying on its observation that the criteria for scheduling controlled substances are primarily concerned with \"addiction or abnormal effects on the nervous system,\" <i>ante,</i> at 273 (citing 21 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> U.S.C. §§ 811(c)(7), 812(b), 811(f), 801a), the Court concludes that the CSA's prescription requirement must be interpreted in light of this narrow view of the statute's purpose.</p>\n<p>Even assuming, however, that the <i>principal</i> concern of the CSA is the curtailment of \"addiction and recreational abuse,\" there is no reason to think that this is its <i>exclusive</i> concern. We have repeatedly observed that Congress often passes statutes that sweep more broadly than the main problem they were designed to address. \"[S]tatutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\" <i>Oncale</i> v. <i>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> 523 U.S. 75, 79 (1998). See also <i>H. J. Inc.</i> v. <i>Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.,</i> 492 U.S. 229, 248 (1989).</p>\n<p>The scheduling provisions of the CSA on which the Court relies confirm that the CSA's \"design,\" <i>ante,</i> at 269, is not as narrow as the Court asserts. In making scheduling determinations, the Attorney General must not only consider a drug's \"psychic or physiological dependence liability\" as the Court points out, <i>ante,</i> at 273 (citing 21 U.S.C. § 811(c)(7)), but must also consider such broad factors as \"[t]he state of current scientific knowledge regarding the drug or other substance,\" § 811(c)(3), and (most notably) \"[w]hat, if any, risk there is to the public health,\" § 811(c)(6). If the latter factor were limited to addiction-related health risks, as the Court supposes, it would be redundant of § 811(c)(7). Moreover, in making registration determinations regarding manufacturers and distributors, the Attorney General \"shall\" consider \"such <i>other</i> factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety,\" §§ 823(a)(6), (b)(5), (d)(6), (e)(5) (emphasis added)over and above the risk of \"diversion\" of controlled substances, §§ 823(a)(1), (a)(5), (b)(1), (d)(1), (d)(5), (e)(1). And, most relevant of all, in registering and deregistering <i>physicians,</i> the Attorney General \"may deny an application <span class=\"star-pagination\">*289</span> for such registration if he determines that the issuance of such registration would be inconsistent with the public interest,\" § 823(f); see also § 824(a)(4), and in making that determination \"shall\" consider \"[s]uch other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety,\" § 823(f)(5). <i>All</i> of these provisions, not just those selectively cited by the Court, shed light upon the CSA's repeated references to the undefined term \"abuse.\" See §§ 811(a)(1)(A), (c)(1), (c)(4), (c)(5); §§ 812(b)(1)(A), (b)(2)(A), (b)(3)(A), (b)(4)(A), (b)(5)(A).</p>\n<p>By disregarding all these public-interest, public-health, and public-safety objectives, and limiting the CSA to \"addiction and recreational abuse,\" the Court rules out the prohibition of anabolic-steroid use for bodybuilding purposes. It seeks to avoid this consequence by invoking the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 4851. <i>Ante,</i> at 273. But the only effect of that legislation is to make anabolic steroids controlled drugs under Schedule III of the CSA. If the only <i>basis</i> for control is (as the Court says) \"addiction and recreational abuse,\" dispensation of these drugs for bodybuilding could not be proscribed.</p>\n<p>Although, as I have described, the Court's opinion no more defers to state law than does the Directive, the Court relies on two provisions for the conclusion that \"[t]he structure and operation of the CSA presume and rely upon a functioning medical profession regulated under the States' police powers,\" <i>ante,</i> at 270namely, the registration provisions of § 823(f) and the nonpre-emption provision of § 903. Reliance on the former is particularly unfortunate, because the Court's own analysis recounts how Congress amended § 823(f) in 1984 in order to <i>liberate</i> the Attorney General's power over registration from the control of state regulators. See <i>ante,</i> at 261; 21 U.S.C. § 823(f); see also Brief for Petitioners 34-35. And the nonpre-emption clause is embarrassingly inapplicable, since it merely disclaims field pre-emption, and affirmatively <i>prescribes</i> federal pre-emption <span class=\"star-pagination\">*290</span> whenever state law creates a conflict.<sup>[5]</sup> In any event, the Directive does not purport to pre-empt state law in any way, not even by conflict pre-emptionunless the Court is under the misimpression that some States <i>require</i> assisted suicide. The Directive merely interprets the CSA to prohibit, like countless other federal criminal provisions, conduct that happens not to be forbidden under state law (or at least the law of the State of Oregon).</p>\n<p>With regard to the CSA's registration provisions, 21 U.S.C. §§ 823(f), 824(a), the Court argues that the statute cannot fairly be read to \"`hide elephants in mouseholes'\" by delegating to the Attorney General the power to determine the legitimacy of medical practices in \"`vague terms or ancillary provisions.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 267 (quoting <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.,</i> 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001)). This case bears not the remotest resemblance to <i>Whitman,</i> which held that \"Congress . . . does not alter <i>the fundamental details</i> of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). The Attorney General's power to issue regulations against questionable uses of controlled substances in no way alters \"the fundamental details\" of the CSA. I am aware of only four areas in which the Department of Justice has exercised that power to regulate uses of controlled substances <i>unrelated</i> to \"addiction and recreational abuse\" as the Court apparently understands that phrase: assisted suicide, aggressive pain management therapy, anabolic-steroid use, and cosmetic weight-loss therapy. See, <i>e. g., In re Harline,</i> 65 Fed. Reg. 5665, 5667 (2000) (weight loss); <i>In re Tecca,</i> 62 Fed. Reg. 12842, 12846 (1997) (anabolic steroids); <i>In re Roth,</i> 60 Fed. Reg. 62262, 62263, 62267 (1995) (pain management). There is no indication that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> enforcement in these areas interferes with the prosecution of \"drug abuse\" as the Court understands it. Unlike in <i>Whitman,</i> the Attorney General's <i>additional</i> power to address other forms of drug \"abuse\" does <i>absolutely nothing</i> to undermine the central features of this regulatory scheme. Of course it was critical to our analysis in <i>Whitman</i> that the language of the provision did not bear the meaning that respondents sought to give it. See 531 U.S., at 465. Here, for the reasons stated above, the provision is most naturally interpreted to incorporate a uniform federal standard for legitimacy of medical practice.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, respondents argue that the Attorney General must defer to state-law judgments about what constitutes legitimate medicine, on the ground that Congress must speak clearly to impose such a uniform federal standard upon the States. But no line of our clear-statement cases is applicable here. The canon of avoidance does not apply, since the Directive does not push the outer limits of Congress's commerce power, compare <i>Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.</i> v. <i>Army Corps of Engineers,</i> 531 U.S. 159, 172 (2001) (regulation of isolated ponds), with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sullivan,</i> 332 U.S. 689, 698 (1948) (regulation of labeling of drugs shipped in interstate commerce), or impinge on a core aspect of state sovereignty, cf. <i>Atascadero State Hospital</i> v. <i>Scanlon,</i> 473 U.S. 234, 242 (1985) (sovereign immunity); <i>Gregory</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991) (qualifications of state government officials). The clear-statement rule based on the presumption against pre-emption does not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> apply because the Directive does not pre-empt any state law, cf. <i>id.,</i> at 456-457; <i>Rush Prudential HMO, Inc.</i> v. <i>Moran,</i> 536 U.S. 355, 359 (2002). And finally, no clear statement is required on the ground that the Directive intrudes upon an area traditionally reserved exclusively to the States, cf. <i>BFP</i> v. <i>Resolution Trust Corporation,</i> 511 U.S. 531, 544 (1994) (state regulation of titles to real property), because the Federal Government has pervasively regulated the dispensation of drugs for over 100 years. See generally Brief for Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 3-15. It would be a novel and massive expansion of the clear-statement rule to apply it in a commerce case <i>not involving pre-emption or constitutional avoidance,</i> merely because Congress has chosen to prohibit conduct that a State has made a contrary policy judgment to permit. See <i>Sullivan, supra,</i> at 693.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Even if the Regulation did not exist and \"prescription\" in § 829 could not be interpreted to require a \"legitimate medical purpose,\" the Directive's conclusion that \"prescribing, dispensing, or administering federally controlled substances. . . by a physician . . . may `render his registration . . . inconsistent with the public interest' and therefore subject to possible suspension or revocation under 21 U.S.C. [§] 824(a)(4),\" 66 Fed. Reg. 56608, would nevertheless be unassailable in this Court.</p>\n<p>Sections 823(f) and 824(a) explicitly grant the Attorney General the authority to register and deregister physicians, and his discretion in exercising that authority is spelled out in very broad terms. He may refuse to register or deregister if he determines that registration is \"inconsistent with the public interest,\" 21 U.S.C. § 823(f), after considering five factors, the fifth of which is \"[s]uch other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety,\" § 823(f)(5). See also <i>In re Arora,</i> 60 Fed. Reg. 4447, 4448 (1995) (\"It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> i. e., the Deputy Administrator may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate\"). As the Court points out, these broad standards were enacted in the 1984 amendments for the specific purpose of <i>freeing</i> the Attorney General's discretion over registration from the decisions of state authorities. See <i>ante,</i> at 261.</p>\n<p>The fact that assisted-suicide prescriptions are issued in violation of § 829 is of course sufficient to support the Directive's conclusion that issuing them may be cause for deregistration: such prescriptions would violate the fourth factor of § 823(f), namely, \"[c]ompliance with applicable . . . Federal . . . laws relating to controlled substances,\" 21 U.S.C. § 823(f)(4). But the Attorney General did not rely solely on subsection (f)(4) in reaching his conclusion that registration would be \"inconsistent with the public interest\"; nothing in the text of the Directive indicates that. Subsection (f)(5) (\"[s]uch other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety\") provides an independent, alternative basis for the Directive's conclusion regarding deregistrationprovided that the Attorney General has authority to interpret \"public interest\" and \"public health and safety\" in § 823(f) to exclude assisted suicide.</p>\n<p>Three considerations make it perfectly clear that the statute confers authority to interpret these phrases upon the Attorney General. First, the Attorney General is solely and explicitly charged with administering the registration and deregistration provisions. See §§ 823(f), 824(a). By making the criteria for such registration and deregistration such obviously ambiguous factors as \"public interest\" and \"public health and safety,\" Congress implicitly (but clearly) gave the Attorney General authority to interpret those criteria <i>whether or not</i> there is any explicit delegation provision in the statute. \"Sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit. In such a case, a court may not substitute its own <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S., at 844. The Court's exclusive focus on the <i>explicit</i> delegation provisions is, at best, a fossil of our pre-<i>Chevron</i> era; at least since <i>Chevron,</i> we have not conditioned our deferral to agency interpretations upon the existence of explicit delegation provisions. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mead Corp.,</i> 533 U.S. 218, 229 (2001), left this principle of implicit delegation intact.</p>\n<p>Second, even if explicit delegation were required, Congress provided it in § 821, which authorizes the Attorney General to \"promulgate rules and regulations . . . relating to the <i>registration and control</i> of the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) Because \"dispensing\" refers to the delivery of a controlled substance \"pursuant to the lawful order of, a practitioner,\" 21 U.S.C. § 802(10), the deregistration of such practitioners for writing impermissible orders \"relat[es] to the registration . . . of the . . . dispensing\" of controlled substances, 21 U.S.C. § 821 (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>Third, § 821 also gives the Attorney General authority to promulgate rules and regulations \"relating to the . . . control of the . . . dispensing of controlled substances.\" As discussed earlier, it is plain that the <i>ordinary</i> meaning of \"control\" must apply to § 821, so that the plain import of the provision is to grant the Attorney General rulemaking authority over all the provisions of part C of the CSA, §§ 821-830 (main ed. and Supp. 2005). Registering and deregistering the practitioners who issue the prescriptions necessary for lawful dispensation of controlled substances plainly \"relat[es] to the . . . control of the . . . dispensing of controlled substances.\" § 821 (Supp. 2005).</p>\n<p>The Attorney General is thus authorized to promulgate regulations interpreting §§ 823(f) and 824(a), both by implicit delegation in § 823(f) and by two grounds of explicit delegation in § 821. The Court nevertheless holds that this triply <span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> unambiguous delegation cannot be given full effect because \"the design of the statute,\" <i>ante,</i> at 265, evinces the intent to grant the Secretary of Health and Human Services exclusive authority over scientific and medical determinations. This proposition is not remotely plausible. The Court cites as authority for the Secretary's exclusive authority two specific areas in which his medical determinations are said to be binding on the Attorney Generalwith regard to the \"scientific and medical evaluation\" of a drug's effects that precedes its scheduling, § 811(b), and with regard to \"the appropriate methods of professional practice in the medical treatment of the narcotic addiction of various classes of narcotic addicts,\" 42 U.S.C. § 290bb-2a; see also 21 U.S.C. § 823(g) (2000 ed. and Supp. II). See <i>ante,</i> at 265-266. Far from establishing a general principle of Secretary supremacy with regard to all scientific and medical determinations, the fact that Congress granted the Secretary specifically defined authority in the areas of scheduling and addiction treatment, <i>without otherwise mentioning him</i> in the registration provisions, suggests, to the contrary, that Congress envisioned <i>no</i> role for the Secretary in that areawhere, as we have said, interpretive authority was both implicitly and explicitly conferred upon the Attorney General.</p>\n<p>Even if we could rewrite statutes to accord with sensible \"design,\" it is far from a certainty that the Secretary, rather than the Attorney General, ought to control the registration of physicians. Though registration decisions sometimes require judgments about the legitimacy of medical practices, the Department of Justice has seemingly had no difficulty making them. See <i>In re Harline,</i> 65 Fed. Reg. 5665; <i>In re Tecca,</i> 62 Fed. Reg. 12842; <i>In re Roth,</i> 60 Fed. Reg. 62262. But unlike decisions about whether a substance should be scheduled or whether a narcotics addiction treatment is legitimate, registration decisions are not exclusively, or even primarily, concerned with \"medical [and] scientific\" factors. See 21 U.S.C. § 823(f). Rather, the decision to register, or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> to bring an action to deregister, an individual <i>physician</i> implicates all the policy goals and competing enforcement priorities that attend any exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is entirely reasonable to think (as Congress evidently did) that it would be easier for the Attorney General occasionally to make judgments about the legitimacy of medical practices than it would be for the Secretary to get into the business of law enforcement. It is, in other words, perfectly consistent with an intelligent \"design of the statute\" to give the Nation's chief law enforcement official, not its chief health official, broad discretion over the substantive standards that govern registration and deregistration. That is <i>especially</i> true where the contested \"scientific and medical\" judgment at issue has to do with the legitimacy of physician-assisted suicide, which ultimately rests, not on \"science\" or \"medicine,\" but on a naked value judgment. It no more depends upon a \"quintessentially medical judgmen[t],\" <i>ante,</i> at 267, than does the legitimacy of polygamy or eugenic infanticide. And it requires no particular <i>medical</i> training to undertake the objective inquiry into how the continuing traditions of Western medicine have consistently treated this subject. See OLC Memo, App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a-130a. The Secretary's supposedly superior \"medical expertise\" to make \"medical judgments,\" <i>ante,</i> at 266, is strikingly irrelevant to the case at hand.</p>\n<p>The Court also reasons that, even if the CSA grants the Attorney General authority to interpret § 823(f), the Directive does not purport to exercise that authority, because it \"does not undertake the five-factor analysis\" of § 823(f) and does not \"on its face purport to be an <i>application</i> of the registration provision in § 823(f).\" <i>Ante,</i> at 261 (emphasis added). This reasoning is sophistic. It would be improperindeed, <i>impossible</i>for the Attorney General to \"undertake the five-factor analysis\" of § 823(f) and to \"appl[y] the registration provision\" outside the context of an actual enforcement proceeding. But of course the Attorney General <span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span> may issue regulations to clarify his interpretation of the five factors, and to signal how he will apply them in future enforcement proceedings. That is what the Directive plainly purports to do by citing § 824(a)(4), and that is why the Directive's conclusion on deregistration is couched in conditional terms: \"Such conduct by a physician . . . <i>may</i> `render his registration . . . inconsistent with the public interest' and therefore subject to <i>possible</i> suspension or revocation under 21 U.S.C. [§] 824(a)(4).\" 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>It follows from what we have said that the Attorney General's authoritative interpretations of \"public interest\" and \"public health and safety\" in § 823(f) are subject to <i>Chevron</i> deference. As noted earlier, the Court does not contest that the absence of notice-and-comment procedures for the Directive renders <i>Chevron</i> inapplicable. And there is no serious argument that \"Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\" or that the Directive's interpretations of \"public health and safety\" and \"inconsistent with the public interest\" are not \"permissible.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S., at 842-843. On the latter point, in fact, the condemnation of assisted suicide by 50 American jurisdictions supports the Attorney General's view. The Attorney General may therefore weigh a physician's participation in assisted suicide as a factor counseling against his registration, or in favor of deregistration, under § 823(f).</p>\n<p>In concluding to the contrary, the Court merely presents the conclusory assertion that \"it is doubtful the Attorney General could cite the `public interest' or `public health' to deregister a physician simply because he deemed a controversial practice permitted by state law to have an illegitimate medical purpose.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 264. But why on earth not?especially when he has interpreted the relevant statutory factors in advance to give fair warning that such a practice is \"inconsistent with the public interest.\" The Attorney General's discretion to determine the public interest in this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*298</span> area is admittedly broadbut certainly no broader than other congressionally conferred executive powers that we have upheld in the past. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>National Broadcasting Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 319 U.S. 190, 216-217 (1943) (\"public interest\"); <i>New York Central Securities Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 287 U.S. 12, 24-25 (1932) (same); see also <i>Mistretta</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 488 U.S. 361, 415-416 (1989) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>In sum, the Directive's first conclusionnamely, that physician-assisted suicide is not a \"legitimate medical purpose\"is supported both by the deference we owe to the agency's interpretation of its own regulations and by the deference we owe to its interpretation of the statute. The other two conclusions(2) that prescribing controlled drugs to assist suicide violates the CSA, and (3) that such conduct is also \"inconsistent with the public interest\"are inevitable consequences of that first conclusion. Moreover, the third conclusion, standing alone, is one that the Attorney General is authorized to make.</p>\n<p>The Court's decision today is perhaps driven by a feeling that the subject of assisted suicide is none of the Federal Government's business. It is easy to sympathize with that position. The prohibition or deterrence of assisted suicide is certainly not among the enumerated powers conferred on the United States by the Constitution, and it is within the realm of public morality <i>(bonos mores)</i> traditionally addressed by the so-called police power of the States. But then, neither is prohibiting the recreational use of drugs or discouraging drug addiction among the enumerated powers. From an early time in our national history, the Federal Government has used its enumerated powers, such as its power to regulate interstate commerce, for the purpose of protecting public moralityfor example, by banning the interstate shipment of lottery tickets, or the interstate transport of women for immoral purposes. See <i>Hoke</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*299</span> 227 U.S. 308, 321-323 (1913); <i>Lottery Case,</i> 188 U.S. 321, 356 (1903). Unless we are to repudiate a long and well-established principle of our jurisprudence, using the federal commerce power to prevent assisted suicide is unquestionably permissible. The question before us is not whether Congress <i>can</i> do this, or even whether Congress <i>should</i> do this; but simply whether Congress <i>has</i> done this in the CSA. I think there is no doubt that it has. If the term \"<i>legitimate</i> medical purpose\" has any meaning, it surely excludes the prescription of drugs to produce death.</p>\n<p>For the above reasons, I respectfully dissent from the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>When Angel Raich and Diane Monson challenged the application of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. § 801 <i>et seq.,</i> to their purely intrastate possession of marijuana for medical use as authorized under California law, a majority of this Court (a mere seven months ago) determined that the CSA effectively invalidated California's law because \"the CSA is a comprehensive regulatory regime specifically designed to regulate which controlled substances can be utilized for medicinal purposes, <i>and in what manner.\" </i><i>Gonzales</i> v. <i>Raich,</i> 545 U.S. 1, 27 (2005) (emphasis added). The majority employed unambiguous language, concluding that the \"manner\" in which controlled substances can be utilized \"for medicinal purposes\" is one of the \"core activities regulated by the CSA.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 28. And, it described the CSA as \"creating a comprehensive framework for regulating the production, distribution, and possession of . . . `controlled substances,'\" including those substances that \"`have a useful and legitimate medical purpose,'\" in order to \"foster the beneficial use of those medications\" and \"to prevent their misuse.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 24.</p>\n<p>Today the majority beats a hasty retreat from these conclusions. Confronted with a regulation that broadly requires <span class=\"star-pagination\">*300</span> all prescriptions to be issued for a \"legitimate medical purpose,\" 21 CFR § 1306.04(a) (2005), a regulation recognized in <i>Raich</i> as part of the Federal Government's \"closed . . . system\" for regulating the \"manner\" in \"which controlled substances can be utilized for medicinal purposes,\" 545 U.S., at 13, 27, the majority rejects the Attorney General's admittedly \"at least reasonable,\" <i>ante,</i> at 272, determination that administering controlled substances to facilitate a patient's death is not a \"`legitimate medical purpose.'\" The majority does so based on its conclusion that the CSA is only concerned with the regulation of \"medical practice insofar as it bars doctors from using their prescription-writing powers as a means to engage in illicit drug dealing and trafficking as conventionally understood.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 270. In other words, in stark contrast to <i>Raich'</i>s broad conclusions about the scope of the CSA as it pertains to the medicinal use of controlled substances, today this Court concludes that the CSA is merely concerned with fighting \"`drug abuse'\" and only insofar as that abuse leads to \"addiction or abnormal effects on the nervous system.\"<sup>[1]</sup><i>Ante,</i> at 273.</p>\n<p>The majority's newfound understanding of the CSA as a statute of limited reach is all the more puzzling because it rests upon constitutional principles that the majority of the Court rejected in <i>Raich.</i> Notwithstanding the States' \"`traditional police powers to define the criminal law and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens,'\" 545 U.S., at 30, n. 38, the <i>Raich</i> majority concluded that the CSA applied to the intrastate possession of marijuana for medicinal purposes authorized by California law because \"Congress could have rationally\" concluded that such an application was necessary to the regulation of the \"larger interstate marijuana market.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 30, 32. Here, by contrast, the majority's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> restrictive interpretation of the CSA is based in no small part on \"the structure and limitations of federalism, which allow the States `\"great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.\"'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 270 (quoting <i>Medtronic, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lohr,</i> 518 U.S. 470, 475 (1996), in turn quoting <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 471 U.S. 724, 756 (1985)). According to the majority, these \"background principles of our federal system . . . belie the notion that Congress would use . . . an obscure grant of authority to regulate areas traditionally supervised by the States' police power.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 274.</p>\n<p>Of course there is nothing \"obscure\" about the CSA's grant of authority to the Attorney General. <i>Ante,</i> p. 275 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). And, the Attorney General's conclusion that the CSA prohibits the States from authorizing physician assisted suicide is admittedly \"at least reasonable,\" <i>ante,</i> at 272 (opinion of the Court), and is therefore entitled to deference. <i>Ante,</i> at 284-285 (Scalia, J., dissenting). While the scope of the CSA and the Attorney General's power thereunder are sweeping, and perhaps troubling, such expansive federal legislation and broad grants of authority to administrative agencies are merely the inevitable and inexorable consequence of this Court's Commerce Clause and separation-ofpowers jurisprudence. See, <i>e. g., Raich, supra; </i><i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.,</i> 531 U.S. 457 (2001).</p>\n<p>I agree with limiting the applications of the CSA in a manner consistent with the principles of federalism and our constitutional structure. <i>Raich, supra,</i> at 74 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); cf. <i>Whitman, supra,</i> at 486-487 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (noting constitutional concerns with broad delegations of authority to administrative agencies). But that is now water over the dam. The relevance of such considerations was at its zenith in <i>Raich,</i> when we considered whether the CSA could be applied to the intrastate possession of a controlled substance consistent with the limited federal powers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*302</span> enumerated by the Constitution. Such considerations have little, if any, relevance where, as here, we are merely presented with a question of statutory interpretation, and not the extent of constitutionally permissible federal power. This is particularly true where, as here, we are interpreting broad, straightforward language within a statutory framework that a majority of this Court has concluded is so comprehensive that it necessarily nullifies the States' \"`traditional . . . powers . . . to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens.'\"<sup>[2]</sup><i>Raich, supra,</i> at 30, n. 38. The Court's reliance upon the constitutional principles that it rejected in <i>Raich</i>albeit under the guise of statutory interpretation is perplexing to say the least.

Frank.</i></p>\n<p>[1]  To be sure, this acknowledgment did not go far enough, because it overlooked the significance of the word \"legitimate,\" which is most naturally understood to create an objective, <i>federal</i> standard for appropriate medical uses. See <i>Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians</i> v. <i>Holyfield,</i> 490 U.S. 30, 43 (1989) (\"We start . . . with the general assumption that in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary, . . . Congress when it enacts a statute is not making the application of the federal act dependent on state law\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>[2]  The only place outside 21 U.S.C. § 801 in which the statute uses the phrase \"legitimate medical purpose\" is in defining the phrase \"valid prescription\" for purposes of the reporting requirements that apply to mail orders of regulated substances. See § 830(b)(3)(A)(ii). The Regulation did not \"parrot\" this statutory section, because the Regulation was adopted in 1971 and the statutory language was added in 2000. See Brief for Petitioners 17 (citing the Children's Health Act of 2000, § 3652, 114 Stat. 1239, 21 U.S.C. § 830(b)(3)). But even if the statutory language had predated the Regulation, there would be no \"parroting\" of that phrase. In using the word \"prescription\" <i>without</i> definition in the much more critical § 829, Congress left the task of resolving any ambiguity in that word, used in that context, to the relevant executive officer. That the officer did so by deeming relevant a technically inapplicable statutory definition contained elsewhere in the statute does not make him a parrot. He has given to the statutory text a meaning it did not explicitlyand perhaps even not necessarilycontain.</p>\n<p>[3]  The Court concludes that \"[e]ven if `control' in § 821 were understood to signify something other than its statutory definition, it would not support the Interpretive Rule.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 260. That conclusion rests upon a misidentification of the text that the Attorney General, pursuant to his \"control\" authority, is interpreting. No one argues that the word \"control\" in § 821 gives the Attorney General \"authority to define diversion based on his view of legitimate medical practice,\" <i>ibid.</i> Rather, that word authorizes the Attorney General to interpret (among other things) the \"prescription\" requirement of § 829. The question then becomes whether the phrase <i>\"legitimate medical purpose\"</i> (which all agree is included in \"prescription\") is at least <i>open</i> to the interpretation announced in the Directive. See <i>Chevron U.S. A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984). And of course it isas the Court effectively concedes two pages earlier: \"All would agree, we should think, that the statutory phrase `legitimate medical purpose' is a generality, susceptible to more precise definition and open to varying constructions, and thus ambiguous in the relevant sense.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 258 (citing <i>Chevron</i>).</p>\n<p>[4]  This phrase appears only in the Regulation and not in the relevant section of the statute. But as pointed out earlier, the Court does not contest that this is the most reasonable interpretation of the section regarding it, indeed, as a mere \"parroting\" of the statute.</p>\n<p>[5]  Title 21 U.S.C. § 903 reads, in relevant part, as follows: \"No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which that provision operates, including criminal penalties, to the exclusion of any State law on the same subject matter . . . unless there is a positive conflict . . . .\"</p>\n<p>[6]  The other case cited by the Court, <i>FDA</i> v. <i>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> 529 U.S. 120 (2000), is even more obviously inapt. There we relied on the first step of the <i>Chevron</i> analysis to determine that Congress had spoken to the precise issue in question, impliedly repealing the grant of jurisdiction on which the Food and Drug Administration relied. 529 U.S., at 160-161. Here, Congress has not expressly or impliedly authorized the practice of assisted suicide, or indeed \"spoken directly\" to the subject in any way beyond the text of the CSA.</p>\n<p>[1]  The majority does not expressly address whether the ingestion of a quantity of drugs that is sufficient to cause death has an \"abnormal effec[t] on the nervous system,\" <i>ante,</i> at 273, though it implicitly rejects such a conclusion.</p>\n<p>[2]  Notably, respondents have not seriously pressed a constitutional claim here, conceding at oral argument that their \"point is not necessarily that [the CSA] would be unconstitutional.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 44. In any event, to the extent respondents do present a constitutional claim, they do so solely within the framework of <i>Raich.</i> Framed in this manner, the claim must fail. The respondents in <i>Raich</i> were \"local growers and users of state-authorized, medical marijuana,\" who stood \"outside the interstate drug market\" and possessed \"`medicinal marijuana . . . not intended for . . . the stream of commerce.'\" 545 U.S., at 62, 72 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Here, by contrast, the respondent-physicians are active participants in the interstate controlled substances market, and the drugs they prescribe for assisting suicide have likely traveled in interstate commerce. If the respondents in <i>Raich</i> could not sustain a constitutional claim, then <i>a fortiori</i> respondents here cannot sustain one. Respondents' acceptance of <i>Raich</i> forecloses their constitutional challenge.</p>\n\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></span> (2006)</b></center>\n<center><h1>GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL.<br>\nv.<br>\nOREGON ET AL.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 04-623.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued October 5, 2005.</center>\n<center>Decided January 17, 2006.</center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*247</span> <i>Solicitor General Clement</i> argued the cause for petitioners.

As the Court has observed, \"Americans are engaged in an earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality, and practicality of physician-assisted suicide.\" <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Glucksberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118144\"><a href=\"/opinion/118144/washington-v-glucksberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span>, 735 (1997). The dispute before us is in part a product of this political and moral debate, but its resolution requires an inquiry familiar to the courts: interpreting a federal statute to determine whether executive action is authorized by, or otherwise consistent with, the enactment.</p>\n<p>In 1994, Oregon became the first State to legalize assisted suicide when voters approved a ballot measure enacting the Oregon Death With Dignity Act (ODWDA). Ore. Rev. Stat. § 127.800 <i>et seq.</i> (2003). ODWDA, which survived a 1997 ballot measure seeking its repeal, exempts from civil or criminal liability state-licensed physicians who, in compliance with the specific safeguards in ODWDA, dispense or prescribe a lethal dose of drugs upon the request of a terminally ill patient.</p>\n<p>The drugs Oregon physicians prescribe under ODWDA are regulated under a federal statute, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA or Act). 84 Stat. 1242, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 801 <i>et seq.</i> The CSA allows these particular drugs to be available only by a written prescription from a registered physician. In the ordinary course the same drugs are prescribed in smaller doses for pain alleviation.</p>\n<p>A November 9, 2001, Interpretive Rule issued by the Attorney General addresses the implementation and enforcement of the CSA with respect to ODWDA. It determines that using controlled substances to assist suicide is not a legitimate medical practice and that dispensing or prescribing them for this purpose is unlawful under the CSA. The Interpretive Rule's validity under the CSA is the issue before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*250</span> I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We turn first to the text and structure of the CSA. Enacted in 1970 with the main objectives of combating drug abuse and controlling the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances, the CSA creates a comprehensive, closed regulatory regime criminalizing the unauthorized manufacture, distribution, dispensing, and possession of substances classified in any of the Act's five schedules. <i>Gonzales</i> v. <i>Raich,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799995\"><a href=\"/opinion/799995/gonzales-v-raich/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 12-13 (2005); 21 U.S.C. § 841 (2000 ed. and Supp. II); 21 U.S.C. § 844. The Act places substances in one of five schedules based on their potential for abuse or dependence, their accepted medical use, and their accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Schedule I contains the most severe restrictions on access and use, and Schedule V the least. <i>Raich, supra,</i> at 14; 21 U.S.C. § 812. Congress classified a host of substances when it enacted the CSA, but the statute permits the Attorney General to add, remove, or reschedule substances. He may do so, however, only after making particular findings, and on scientific and medical matters he is required to accept the findings of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary). These proceedings must be on the record after an opportunity for comment. See 21 U.S.C. § 811 (2000 ed. and Supp. V).</p>\n<p>The present dispute involves controlled substances listed in Schedule II, substances generally available only pursuant to a written, nonrefillable prescription by a physician. 21 U.S.C. § 829(a). A 1971 regulation promulgated by the Attorney General requires that every prescription for a controlled substance \"be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.\" 21 CFR § 1306.04(a) (2005).</p>\n<p>To prevent diversion of controlled substances with medical uses, the CSA regulates the activity of physicians. To issue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*251</span> lawful prescriptions of Schedule II drugs, physicians must \"obtain from the Attorney General a registration issued in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by him.\" 21 U.S.C. § 822(a)(2). The Attorney General may deny, suspend, or revoke this registration if, as relevant here, the physician's registration would be \"inconsistent with the public interest.\" § 824(a)(4); § 822(a)(2). When deciding whether a practitioner's registration is in the public interest, the Attorney General \"shall\" consider:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.\" § 823(f).</blockquote>\n<p>The CSA explicitly contemplates a role for the States in regulating controlled substances, as evidenced by its pre-emption provision.</p>\n<blockquote>\"No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which that provision operates . . . to the exclusion of any State law on the same subject matter which would otherwise be within the authority of the State, unless there is a positive conflict between that provision . . . and that State law so that the two cannot consistently stand together.\" § 903.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Oregon voters enacted ODWDA in 1994. For Oregon residents to be eligible to request a prescription under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*252</span> ODWDA, they must receive a diagnosis from their attending physician that they have an incurable and irreversible disease that, within reasonable medical judgment, will cause death within six months. Ore. Rev. Stat. §§ 127.815, 127.800(12) (2003). Attending physicians must also determine whether a patient has made a voluntary request, ensure a patient's choice is informed, and refer patients to counseling if they might be suffering from a psychological disorder or depression causing impaired judgment. §§ 127.815, 127.825. A second \"consulting\" physician must examine the patient and the medical record and confirm the attending physician's conclusions. § 127.800(8). Oregon physicians may dispense or issue a prescription for the requested drug, but may not administer it. §§ 127.815(1)(L), 127.880.</p>\n<p>The reviewing physicians must keep detailed medical records of the process leading to the final prescription, § 127.855, records that Oregon's Department of Human Services reviews, § 127.865. Physicians who dispense medication pursuant to ODWDA must also be registered with both the State's Board of Medical Examiners and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). § 127.815(1)(L). In 2004, 37 patients ended their lives by ingesting a lethal dose of medication prescribed under ODWDA. Oregon Dept. of Human Servs., Seventh Annual Report on Oregon's Death with Dignity Act 20 (Mar. 10, 2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In 1997, Members of Congress concerned about ODWDA invited the DEA to prosecute or revoke the CSA registration of Oregon physicians who assist suicide. They contended that hastening a patient's death is not legitimate medical practice, so prescribing controlled substances for that purpose violates the CSA. Letter from Sen. Orrin Hatch and Rep. Henry Hyde to Thomas A. Constantine (July 25, 1997), reprinted in Hearing on S. 2151 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., 2-3 (1999) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*253</span> (hereinafter Hearing). The letter received an initial, favorable response from the director of the DEA, see Letter from Thomas A. Constantine to Sen. Orrin Hatch (Nov. 5, 1997), Hearing 4-5, but Attorney General Reno considered the matter and concluded that the DEA could not take the proposed action because the CSA did not authorize it to \"displace the states as the primary regulators of the medical profession, or to override a state's determination as to what constitutes legitimate medical practice,\" Letter from Attorney General Janet Reno to Sen. Orrin Hatch, on Oregon's Death with Dignity Act (June 5, 1998), Hearing 5-6. Legislation was then introduced to grant the explicit authority Attorney General Reno found lacking; but it failed to pass. See H. R. 4006, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998); H. R. 2260, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. (1999).</p>\n<p>In 2001, John Ashcroft was appointed Attorney General. Perhaps because Mr. Ashcroft had supported efforts to curtail assisted suicide while serving as a Senator, see, <i>e. g.,</i> 143 Cong. Rec. 5589-5590 (1997) (remarks of Sen. Ashcroft), Oregon Attorney General Hardy Myers wrote him to request a meeting with Department of Justice officials should the Department decide to revisit the application of the CSA to assisted suicide. Letter of Feb. 2, 2001, App. to Brief for Patient-Respondents in Opposition 55a. Attorney General Myers received a reply letter from one of Attorney General Ashcroft's advisers writing on his behalf, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I am aware of no pending legislation in Congress that would prompt a review of the Department's interpretation of the CSA as it relates to physician-assisted suicide. Should such a review be commenced in the future, we would be happy to include your views in that review.\" Letter from Lori Sharpe (Apr. 17, 2001), <i>id.,</i> at 58a.</blockquote>\n<p>On November 9, 2001, without consulting Oregon or apparently anyone outside his Department, the Attorney General <span class=\"star-pagination\">*254</span> issued an Interpretive Rule announcing his intent to restrict the use of controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide. Incorporating the legal analysis of a memorandum he had solicited from his Office of Legal Counsel, the Attorney General ruled:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[A]ssisting suicide is not a `legitimate medical purpose' within the meaning of 21 CFR 1306.04 (2001), and that prescribing, dispensing, or administering federally controlled substances to assist suicide violates the Controlled Substances Act. Such conduct by a physician registered to dispense controlled substances may `render his registration . . . inconsistent with the public interest' and therefore subject to possible suspension or revocation under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4). The Attorney General's conclusion applies regardless of whether state law authorizes or permits such conduct by practitioners or others and regardless of the condition of the person whose suicide is assisted.\" 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (2001).</blockquote>\n<p>There is little dispute that the Interpretive Rule would substantially disrupt the ODWDA regime. Respondents contend, and petitioners do not dispute, that every prescription filled under ODWDA has specified drugs classified under Schedule II. A physician cannot prescribe the substances without DEA registration, and revocation or suspension of the registration would be a severe restriction on medical practice. Dispensing controlled substances without a valid prescription, furthermore, is a federal crime. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109337\"><a href=\"/opinion/109337/united-states-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span> (1975).</p>\n<p>In response the State of Oregon, joined by a physician, a pharmacist, and some terminally ill patients, all from Oregon, challenged the Interpretive Rule in federal court. The United States District Court for the District of Oregon entered a permanent injunction against the Interpretive Rule's enforcement.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*255</span> A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the petitions for review and held the Interpretive Rule invalid. <i>Oregon</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786296\"><a href=\"/opinion/786296/state-of-oregon-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1118</span></a></span> (2004). It reasoned that, by making a medical procedure authorized under Oregon law a federal offense, the Interpretive Rule altered the \"`\"usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government\"'\" without the requisite clear statement that the CSA authorized such action. <i>Id.,</i> at 1124-1125 (quoting <i>Gregory</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112632\"><a href=\"/opinion/112632/gregory-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 460 (1991), in turn quoting <i>Atascadero State Hospital</i> v. <i>Scanlon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111503\"><a href=\"/opinion/111503/atascadero-state-hospital-v-scanlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span>, 242 (1985)). The Court of Appeals held in the alternative that the Interpretive Rule could not be squared with the plain language of the CSA, which targets only conventional drug abuse and excludes the Attorney General from decisions on medical policy. 368 F.3d, at 1125-1129.</p>\n<p>We granted the Government's petition for certiorari. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1145</span></span> (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Executive actors often must interpret the enactments Congress has charged them with enforcing and implementing. The parties before us are in sharp disagreement both as to the degree of deference we must accord the Interpretive Rule's substantive conclusions and whether the Rule is authorized by the statutory text at all. Although balancing the necessary respect for an agency's knowledge, expertise, and constitutional office with the courts' role as interpreter of laws can be a delicate matter, familiar principles guide us. An administrative rule may receive substantial deference if it interprets the issuing agency's own ambiguous regulation. <i>Auer</i> v. <i>Robbins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118089\"><a href=\"/opinion/118089/auer-v-robbins/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 461-463 (1997). An interpretation of an ambiguous statute may also receive substantial deference. <i>Chevron U.S. A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 842-845 (1984). Deference in accordance with <i>Chevron,</i> however, is warranted only \"when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*256</span> and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mead Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 226-227 (2001). Otherwise, the interpretation is \"entitled to respect\" only to the extent it has the \"power to persuade.\" <i>Skidmore</i> v. <i>Swift &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 140 (1944).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Government first argues that the Interpretive Rule is an elaboration of one of the Attorney General's own regulations, 21 CFR § 1306.04 (2005), which requires all prescriptions be issued \"for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.\" As such, the Government says, the Interpretive Rule is entitled to considerable deference in accordance with <i>Auer.</i></p>\n<p>In our view <i>Auer</i> and the standard of deference it accords to an agency are inapplicable here. <i>Auer</i> involved a disputed interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 as applied to a class of law enforcement officers. Under regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, an exemption from overtime pay depended, in part, on whether the employees met the \"salary basis\" test. 519 U.S., at 454-455. In this Court the Secretary of Labor filed an <i>amicus</i> brief explaining why, in his view, the regulations gave exempt status to the officers. <i>Id.,</i> at 461. We gave weight to that interpretation, holding that because the applicable test was \"a creature of the Secretary's own regulations, his interpretation of it is, under our jurisprudence, controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>In <i>Auer,</i> the underlying regulations gave specificity to a statutory scheme the Secretary of Labor was charged with enforcing and reflected the considerable experience and expertise the Department of Labor had acquired over time with respect to the complexities of the Fair Labor Standards <span class=\"star-pagination\">*257</span> Act. Here, on the other hand, the underlying regulation does little more than restate the terms of the statute itself. The language the Interpretive Rule addresses comes from Congress, not the Attorney General, and the near equivalence of the statute and regulation belies the Government's argument for <i>Auer</i> deference.</p>\n<p>The Government does not suggest that its interpretation turns on any difference between the statutory and regulatory language. The CSA allows prescription of drugs only if they have a \"currently accepted medical use,\" 21 U.S.C. § 812(b); requires a \"medical purpose\" for dispensing the least controlled substances of those on the schedules, § 829(c); and, in its reporting provision, defines a \"valid prescription\" as one \"issued for a legitimate medical purpose,\" § 830(b)(3)(A)(ii). Similarly, physicians are considered to be acting as practitioners under the statute if they dispense controlled substances \"in the course of professional practice.\" § 802(21). The regulation uses the terms \"legitimate medical purpose\" and \"the course of professional practice,\" <i>ibid.,</i> but this just repeats two statutory phrases and attempts to summarize the others. It gives little or no instruction on a central issue in this case: Who decides whether a particular activity is in \"the course of professional practice\" or done for a \"legitimate medical purpose\"? Since the regulation gives no indication how to decide this issue, the Attorney General's effort to decide it now cannot be considered an interpretation of the regulation. Simply put, the existence of a parroting regulation does not change the fact that the question here is not the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute. An agency does not acquire special authority to interpret its own words when, instead of using its expertise and experience to formulate a regulation, it has elected merely to paraphrase the statutory language.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as explained below, if there is statutory authority to issue the Interpretive Rule it comes from the 1984 amendments to the CSA that gave the Attorney General authority <span class=\"star-pagination\">*258</span> to register and deregister physicians based on the public interest. The regulation was enacted before those amendments, so the Interpretive Rule cannot be justified as indicative of some intent the Attorney General had in 1971. That the current interpretation runs counter to the \"intent at the time of the regulation's promulgation\" is an additional reason why <i>Auer</i> deference is unwarranted. <i>Thomas Jefferson Univ.</i> v. <i>Shalala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117865\"><a href=\"/opinion/117865/thomas-jefferson-univ-v-shalala/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 512 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Deference under <i>Auer</i> being inappropriate, we turn to the question whether the Interpretive Rule, on its own terms, is a permissible interpretation of the CSA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Just as the Interpretive Rule receives no deference under <i>Auer,</i> neither does it receive deference under <i>Chevron.</i> If a statute is ambiguous, judicial review of administrative rulemaking often demands <i>Chevron</i> deference; and the rule is judged accordingly. All would agree, we should think, that the statutory phrase \"legitimate medical purpose\" is a generality, susceptible to more precise definition and open to varying constructions, and thus ambiguous in the relevant sense. <i>Chevron</i> deference, however, is not accorded merely because the statute is ambiguous and an administrative official is involved. To begin with, the rule must be promulgated pursuant to authority Congress has delegated to the official. <i>Mead, supra,</i> at 226-227.</p>\n<p>The Attorney General has rulemaking power to fulfill his duties under the CSA. The specific respects in which he is authorized to make rules, however, instruct us that he is not authorized to make a rule declaring illegitimate a medical standard for care and treatment of patients that is specifically authorized under state law.</p>\n<p>The starting point for this inquiry is, of course, the language of the delegation provision itself. In many cases authority is clear because the statute gives an agency broad power to enforce all provisions of the statute. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>National</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*259</span> <i>Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</i> v. <i>Brand X Internet Services,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799969\"><a href=\"/opinion/799969/national-cable-telecommunications-assn-v-brand-x-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 980 (2005) (explaining that a Federal Communications Commission regulation received <i>Chevron</i> deference because \"Congress has delegated to the Commission the authority to . . . `prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions' of the Act\" (quoting 47 U.S.C. § 201(b))); <i>Household Credit Services, Inc.</i> v. <i>Pfennig,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134733\"><a href=\"/opinion/134733/household-credit-services-inc-v-pfennig/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 238 (2004) (giving <i>Chevron</i> deference to a Federal Reserve Board regulation where \"Congress has expressly delegated to the Board the authority to prescribe regulations. . . as, in the judgment of the Board, `are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of'\" the statute (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1604(a))). The CSA does not grant the Attorney General this broad authority to promulgate rules.</p>\n<p>The CSA gives the Attorney General limited powers, to be exercised in specific ways. His rulemaking authority under the CSA is described in two provisions: (1) \"The Attorney General is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations and to charge reasonable fees relating to the registration and control of the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances and to listed chemicals,\" 21 U.S.C. § 821 (2000 ed., Supp. V); and (2) \"The Attorney General may promulgate and enforce any rules, regulations, and procedures which he may deem necessary and appropriate for the efficient execution of his functions under this subchapter,\" 21 U.S.C. § 871(b). As is evident from these sections, Congress did not delegate to the Attorney General authority to carry out or effect all provisions of the CSA. Rather, he can promulgate rules relating only to \"registration\" and \"control,\" and \"for the efficient execution of his functions\" under the statute.</p>\n<p>Turning first to the Attorney General's authority to make regulations for the \"control\" of drugs, this delegation cannot sustain the Interpretive Rule's attempt to define standards of medical practice. Control is a term of art in the CSA. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*260</span> \"As used in this subchapter,\" § 802the subchapter that includes § 821</p>\n<blockquote>\"The term `control' means to add a drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, to a schedule under part B of this subchapter, whether by transfer from another schedule or otherwise.\" § 802(5).</blockquote>\n<p>To exercise his scheduling power, the Attorney General must follow a detailed set of procedures, including requesting a scientific and medical evaluation from the Secretary. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 811, 812 (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The statute is also specific as to the manner in which the Attorney General must exercise this authority: \"Rules of the Attorney General under this subsection [regarding scheduling] shall be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the rulemaking procedures prescribed by [the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553].\" 21 U.S.C. § 811(a). The Interpretive Rule now under consideration does not concern the scheduling of substances and was not issued after the required procedures for rules regarding scheduling, so it cannot fall under the Attorney General's \"control\" authority.</p>\n<p>Even if \"control\" in § 821 were understood to signify something other than its statutory definition, it would not support the Interpretive Rule. The statutory references to \"control\" outside the scheduling context make clear that the Attorney General can establish controls \"against diversion,\" <i>e. g.,</i> § 823(a)(1), but do not give him authority to define diversion based on his view of legitimate medical practice. As explained below, the CSA's express limitations on the Attorney General's authority, and other indications from the statutory scheme, belie any notion that the Attorney General has been granted this implicit authority. Indeed, if \"control\" were given the expansive meaning required to sustain the Interpretive Rule, it would transform the carefully described <span class=\"star-pagination\">*261</span> limits on the Attorney General's authority over registration and scheduling into mere suggestions.</p>\n<p>We turn, next, to the registration provisions of the CSA. Before 1984, the Attorney General was required to register any physician who was authorized by his State. The Attorney General could only deregister a physician who falsified his application, was convicted of a felony relating to controlled substances, or had his state license or registration revoked. See 84 Stat. 1255. The CSA was amended in 1984 to allow the Attorney General to deny registration to an applicant \"if he determines that the issuance of such registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.\" 21 U.S.C. § 823(f). Registration may also be revoked or suspended by the Attorney General on the same grounds. § 824(a)(4). In determining consistency with the public interest, the Attorney General must, as discussed above, consider five factors, including: the State's recommendation; compliance with state, federal, and local laws regarding controlled substances; and public health and safety. § 823(f).</p>\n<p>The Interpretive Rule cannot be justified under this part of the statute. It does not undertake the five-factor analysis and concerns much more than registration. Nor does the Interpretive Rule on its face purport to be an application of the registration provision in § 823(f). It is, instead, an interpretation of the substantive federal law requirements (under 21 CFR § 1306.04 (2005)) for a valid prescription. It begins by announcing that assisting suicide is not a \"legitimate medical purpose\" under § 1306.04, and that dispensing controlled substances to assist a suicide violates the CSA. 66 Fed. Reg. 56608. Violation is a criminal offense, and often a felony, under 21 U.S.C. § 841 (2000 ed. and Supp. II). The Interpretive Rule thus purports to declare that using controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide is a crime, an authority that goes well beyond the Attorney General's statutory power to register or deregister.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*262</span> The Attorney General's deregistration power, of course, may carry implications for criminal enforcement because if a physician dispenses a controlled substance after he is deregistered, he violates § 841. The Interpretive Rule works in the opposite direction, however: It declares certain conduct criminal, placing in jeopardy the registration of any physician who engages in that conduct. To the extent the Interpretive Rule concerns registration, it simply states the obvious because one of the five factors the Attorney General must consider in deciding the \"public interest\" is \"[c]ompliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.\" 21 U.S.C. § 823(f)(4). The problem with the design of the Interpretive Rule is that it cannot, and does not, explain why the Attorney General has the authority to decide what constitutes an underlying violation of the CSA in the first place. The explanation the Government seems to advance is that the Attorney General's authority to decide whether a physician's actions are inconsistent with the \"public interest\" provides the basis for the Interpretive Rule.</p>\n<p>By this logic, however, the Attorney General claims extraordinary authority. If the Attorney General's argument were correct, his power to deregister necessarily would include the greater power to criminalize even the actions of registered physicians, whenever they engage in conduct he deems illegitimate. This power to criminalizeunlike his power over registration, which must be exercised only after considering five express statutory factorswould be unrestrained. It would be anomalous for Congress to have so painstakingly described the Attorney General's limited authority to deregister a single physician or schedule a single drug, but to have given him, just by implication, authority to declare an entire class of activity outside \"the course of professional practice,\" and therefore a criminal violation of the CSA. See <i>Federal Maritime Comm'n</i> v. <i>Seatrain Lines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108783\"><a href=\"/opinion/108783/federal-maritime-commn-v-seatrain-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></a></span>, 744 (1973) (\"In light of these specific <span class=\"star-pagination\">*263</span> grants of . . . authority, we are unwilling to construe the ambiguous provisions . . . to serve this purpose [of creating further authority]a purpose for which it obviously was not intended\").</p>\n<p><i>Sutton</i> v. <i>United Air Lines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118311\"><a href=\"/opinion/118311/sutton-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span> (1999), is instructive. The statute at issue was the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which, like the CSA, divides interpretive authority among various executive actors. The Court relied on \"the terms and structure of the ADA\" to decide that neither the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), nor any other agency, had authority to define \"disability\" in the ADA. <i>Id.,</i> at 479. Specifically, the delegating provision stated that the EEOC \"shall issue regulations . . . to carry out this subchapter,\" 42 U.S.C. § 12116, and the section of the statute defining \"disability\" was in a different subchapter. The Court did not accept the idea that because \"the employment subchapter, <i>i. e., `this</i> subchapter,' includes other provisions that use the defined terms, . . . [t]he EEOC might elaborate, through regulations, on the meaning of `disability' . . . if elaboration is needed in order to `carry out' the substantive provisions of `this subchapter.'\" 527 U.S., at 514 (Breyer, J., dissenting). See also <i>Adams Fruit Co.</i> v. <i>Barrett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112397\"><a href=\"/opinion/112397/adams-fruit-co-v-barrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span>, 649-650 (1990) (holding that a delegation of authority to promulgate motor vehicle safety <i>\"standards\"</i> did not include the authority to decide the pre-emptive scope of the federal statute because \"[n]o such delegation regarding [the statute's] enforcement provisions is evident in the statute\").</p>\n<p>The same principle controls here. It is not enough that the terms \"public interest,\" \"public health and safety,\" and \"Federal law\" are used in the part of the statute over which the Attorney General has authority. The statutory terms \"public interest\" and \"public health\" do not call on the Attorney General, or any other executive official, to make an independent assessment of the meaning of federal law. The Attorney General did not base the Interpretive Rule on an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*264</span> application of the five-factor test generally, or the \"public health and safety\" factor specifically. Even if he had, it is doubtful the Attorney General could cite the \"public interest\" or \"public health\" to deregister a physician simply because he deemed a controversial practice permitted by state law to have an illegitimate medical purpose.</p>\n<p>As for the federal-law factor, though it does require the Attorney General to decide \"[c]ompliance\" with the law, it does not suggest that he may decide what the law says. Were it otherwise, the Attorney General could authoritatively interpret \"State\" and \"local laws,\" which are also included in 21 U.S.C. § 823(f), despite the obvious constitutional problems in his doing so. Just as he must evaluate compliance with federal law in deciding about registration, the Attorney General must as surely evaluate compliance with federal law in deciding whether to prosecute; but this does not entitle him to <i>Chevron</i> deference. See <i>Crandon</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112379\"><a href=\"/opinion/112379/crandon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 177 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (\"The Justice Department, of course, has a very specific responsibility to determine for itself what this statute means, in order to decide when to prosecute; but we have never thought that the interpretation of those charged with prosecuting criminal statutes is entitled to deference\").</p>\n<p>The limits on the Attorney General's authority to define medical standards for the care and treatment of patients bear also on the proper interpretation of § 871(b). This section allows the Attorney General to best determine how to execute \"his functions.\" It is quite a different matter, however, to say that the Attorney General can define the substantive standards of medical practice as part of his authority. To find a delegation of this extent in § 871 would put that part of the statute in considerable tension with the narrowly defined delegation concerning control and registration. It would go, moreover, against the plain language of the text to treat a delegation for the \"execution\" of his functions as a further delegation to define other functions well beyond <span class=\"star-pagination\">*265</span> the statute's specific grants of authority. When Congress chooses to delegate a power of this extent, it does so not by referring back to the administrator's functions but by giving authority over the provisions of the statute he is to interpret. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799969\"><a href=\"/opinion/799969/national-cable-telecommunications-assn-v-brand-x-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>; <i>Household Credit Services,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134733\"><a href=\"/opinion/134733/household-credit-services-inc-v-pfennig/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The authority desired by the Government is inconsistent with the design of the statute in other fundamental respects. The Attorney General does not have the sole delegated authority under the CSA. He must instead share it with, and in some respects defer to, the Secretary, whose functions are likewise delineated and confined by the statute. The CSA allocates decisionmaking powers among statutory actors so that medical judgments, if they are to be decided at the federal level and for the limited objects of the statute, are placed in the hands of the Secretary. In the scheduling context, for example, the Secretary's recommendations on scientific and medical matters bind the Attorney General. The Attorney General cannot control a substance if the Secretary disagrees. 21 U.S.C. § 811(b). See H. R. Rep. No. 91-1444, pt. 1, p. 33 (1970) (the section \"is not intended to authorize the Attorney General to undertake or support medical and scientific research [for the purpose of scheduling], which is within the competence of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\").</p>\n<p>In a similar vein the 1970 Act's regulation of medical practice with respect to drug rehabilitation gives the Attorney General a limited role; for it is the Secretary who, after consultation with the Attorney General and national medical groups, \"determine[s] the appropriate methods of professional practice in the medical treatment of . . . narcotic addiction.\" 42 U.S.C. § 290bb-2a; see 21 U.S.C. § 823(g) (2000 ed. and Supp. II) (stating that the Attorney General shall register practitioners who dispense drugs for narcotics treatment when the Secretary has determined the applicant is qualified to treat addicts and the Attorney General has concluded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*266</span> the applicant will comply with recordkeeping and security regulations); <i>Moore,</i> 423 U.S., at 144 (noting that in enacting the addiction-treatment provisions, Congress sought to change the fact \"that `criminal prosecutions' in the past had turned on the opinions of federal prosecutors\"); H. R. Rep. No. 93-884, p. 6 (1974) (\"This section preserves the distinctions found in the [CSA] between the functions of the Attorney General and the Secretary . . . . All decisions of a medical nature are to be made by the Secretary . . . . Law enforcement decisions respecting the security of stocks of narcotic drugs and the maintenance of records on such drugs are to be made by the Attorney General\").</p>\n<p>Postenactment congressional commentary on the CSA's regulation of medical practice is also at odds with the Attorney General's claimed authority to determine appropriate medical standards. In 1978, in preparation for ratification of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, Feb. 21, 1971, [1979-1980] 32 U.S. T. 543, T. I. A. S. No. 9725, Congress decided it would implement the United States' compliance through \"the framework of the procedures and criteria for classification of substances provided in the\" CSA. 21 U.S.C. § 801a(3). It did so to ensure that \"nothing in the Convention will interfere with ethical medical practice in this country as determined by [the Secretary] on the basis of a consensus of the views of the American medical and scientific community.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The structure of the CSA, then, conveys unwillingness to cede medical judgments to an executive official who lacks medical expertise. In interpreting statutes that divide authority, the Court has recognized: \"Because historical familiarity and policymaking expertise account in the first instance for the presumption that Congress delegates interpretive lawmaking power to the agency rather than to the reviewing court, we presume here that Congress intended to invest interpretive power in the administrative actor in the best position to develop these attributes.\" <i>Martin</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> v. <i>Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112561\"><a href=\"/opinion/112561/martin-v-occupational-safety-and-health-review-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 153 (1991) (citations omitted). This presumption works against a conclusion that the Attorney General has authority to make quintessentially medical judgments.</p>\n<p>The Government contends the Attorney General's decision here is a legal, not a medical, one. This generality, however, does not suffice. The Attorney General's Interpretive Rule, and the Office of Legal Counsel memo it incorporates, place extensive reliance on medical judgments and the views of the medical community in concluding that assisted suicide is not a \"legitimate medical purpose.\" See 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (noting the \"medical\" distinctions between assisting suicide and giving sufficient medication to alleviate pain); Memorandum from Office of Legal Counsel to Attorney General (June 27, 2001), App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a-122a, and n. 17 (discussing the \"Federal medical policy\" against physician-assisted suicide), <i>id.,</i> at 124a-130a (examining views of the medical community). This confirms that the authority claimed by the Attorney General is both beyond his expertise and incongruous with the statutory purposes and design.</p>\n<p>The idea that Congress gave the Attorney General such broad and unusual authority through an implicit delegation in the CSA's registration provision is not sustainable. \"Congress, we have held, does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisionsit does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\" <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118410\"><a href=\"/opinion/118410/whitman-v-american-trucking-assns-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 468 (2001); see <i>FDA</i> v. <i>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118347\"><a href=\"/opinion/118347/fda-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 160 (2000) (\"[W]e are confident that Congress could not have intended to delegate a decision of such economic and political significance to an agency in so cryptic a fashion\").</p>\n<p>The importance of the issue of physician-assisted suicide, which has been the subject of an \"earnest and profound debate\" across the country, <i>Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S., at 735, makes the oblique form of the claimed delegation all the more suspect. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> Under the Government's theory, moreover, the medical judgments the Attorney General could make are not limited to physician-assisted suicide. Were this argument accepted, he could decide whether any particular drug may be used for any particular purpose, or indeed whether a physician who administers any controversial treatment could be deregistered. This would occur, under the Government's view, despite the statute's express limitation of the Attorney General's authority to registration and control, with attendant restrictions on each of those functions, and despite the statutory purposes to combat drug abuse and prevent illicit drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>We need not decide whether <i>Chevron</i> deference would be warranted for an interpretation issued by the Attorney General concerning matters closer to his role under the CSA, namely, preventing doctors from engaging in illicit drug trafficking. In light of the foregoing, however, the CSA does not give the Attorney General authority to issue the Interpretive Rule as a statement with the force of law.</p>\n<p>If, in the course of exercising his authority, the Attorney General uses his analysis in the Interpretive Rule only for guidance in deciding when to prosecute or deregister, then the question remains whether his substantive interpretation is correct. Since the Interpretive Rule was not promulgated pursuant to the Attorney General's authority, its interpretation of \"legitimate medical purpose\" does not receive <i>Chevron</i> deference. Instead, it receives deference only in accordance with <i>Skidmore.</i> \"The weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\" 323 U.S., at 140; see also <i>Mead,</i> 533 U.S., at 235 (noting that an opinion receiving <i>Skidmore</i> deference may \"claim the merit of its writer's thoroughness, logic, and expertness, its fit with prior interpretations, and any other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*269</span> sources of weight\"). The deference here is tempered by the Attorney General's lack of expertise in this area and the apparent absence of any consultation with anyone outside the Department of Justice who might aid in a reasoned judgment. In any event, under <i>Skidmore,</i> we follow an agency's rule only to the extent it is persuasive, see <i>Christensen</i> v. <i>Harris County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118362\"><a href=\"/opinion/118362/christensen-v-harris-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 587 (2000); and for the reasons given and for further reasons set out below, we do not find the Attorney General's opinion persuasive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>As we have noted before, the CSA \"repealed most of the earlier antidrug laws in favor of a comprehensive regime to combat the international and interstate traffic in illicit drugs.\" <i>Raich,</i> 545 U.S., at 12. In doing so, Congress sought to \"conquer drug abuse and to control the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It comes as little surprise, then, that we have not considered the extent to which the CSA regulates medical practice beyond prohibiting a doctor from acting as a drug \"`pusher'\" instead of a physician. <i>Moore,</i> 423 U.S., at 143. In <i>Moore,</i> we addressed a situation in which a doctor \"sold drugs, not for legitimate purposes, but primarily for the profits to be derived therefrom.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 135 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 91-1444, pt. 1, at 10; internal quotation marks omitted). There the defendant, who had engaged in large-scale over-prescribing of methadone, \"concede[d] in his brief that he did not observe generally accepted medical practices.\" 423 U.S., at 126. And in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118426\"><a href=\"/opinion/118426/united-states-v-oakland-cannabis-buyerscooperative/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span> (2001), Congress' express determination that marijuana had no accepted medical use foreclosed any argument about statutory coverage of drugs available by a doctor's prescription.</p>\n<p>In deciding whether the CSA can be read as prohibiting physician-assisted suicide, we look to the statute's text and design. The statute and our case law amply support the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*270</span> conclusion that Congress regulates medical practice insofar as it bars doctors from using their prescription-writing powers as a means to engage in illicit drug dealing and trafficking as conventionally understood. Beyond this, however, the statute manifests no intent to regulate the practice of medicine generally. The silence is understandable given the structure and limitations of federalism, which allow the States \"`great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.'\" <i>Medtronic, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lohr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118055\"><a href=\"/opinion/118055/medtronic-inc-v-lohr/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 475 (1996) (quoting <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111438\"><a href=\"/opinion/111438/metropolitan-life-ins-co-v-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span>, 756 (1985)).</p>\n<p>The structure and operation of the CSA presume and rely upon a functioning medical profession regulated under the States' police powers. The Attorney General can register a physician to dispense controlled substances \"if the applicant is authorized to dispense . . . controlled substances under the laws of the State in which he practices.\" 21 U.S.C. § 823(f). When considering whether to revoke a physician's registration, the Attorney General looks not just to violations of federal drug laws; but he \"shall\" also consider \"[t]he recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority\" and the registrant's compliance with state and local drug laws. <i>Ibid.</i> The very definition of a \"practitioner\" eligible to prescribe includes physicians \"licensed, registered, or otherwise permitted, by the United States or the jurisdiction in which he practices\" to dispense controlled substances. § 802(21). Further cautioning against the conclusion that the CSA effectively displaces the States' general regulation of medical practice is the Act's pre-emption provision, which indicates that, absent a positive conflict, none of the Act's provisions should be \"construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which that provision operates . . . to the exclusion of any State law on the same subject matter <span class=\"star-pagination\">*271</span> which would otherwise be within the authority of the State.\" § 903.</p>\n<p>Oregon's regime is an example of the state regulation of medical practice that the CSA presupposes. Rather than simply decriminalizing assisted suicide, ODWDA limits its exercise to the attending physicians of terminally ill patients, physicians who must be licensed by Oregon's Board of Medical Examiners. Ore. Rev. Stat. §§ 127.815, 127.800(10) (2003). The statute gives attending physicians a central role, requiring them to provide prognoses and prescriptions, give information about palliative alternatives and counseling, and ensure patients are competent and acting voluntarily. § 127.815. Any eligible patient must also get a second opinion from another registered physician, § 127.820, and the statute's safeguards require physicians to keep and submit to inspection detailed records of their actions, §§ 127.855, 127.865.</p>\n<p>Even though regulation of health and safety is \"primarily, and historically, a matter of local concern,\" <i>Hillsborough County</i> v. <i>Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111437\"><a href=\"/opinion/111437/hillsborough-county-v-automated-medical-laboratori/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 719 (1985), there is no question that the Federal Government can set uniform national standards in these areas. See <i>Raich, supra,</i> at 9. In connection to the CSA, however, we find only one area in which Congress set general, uniform standards of medical practice. Title I of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, of which the CSA was Title II, provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[The Secretary], after consultation with the Attorney General and with national organizations representative of persons with knowledge and experience in the treatment of narcotic addicts, shall determine the appropriate methods of professional practice in the medical treatment of the narcotic addiction of various classes of narcotic addicts, and shall report thereon from time to time to the Congress.\" § 4, 84 Stat. 1241, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 290bb-2a.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*272</span> This provision strengthens the understanding of the CSA as a statute combating recreational drug abuse, and also indicates that when Congress wants to regulate medical practice in the given scheme, it does so by explicit language in the statute.</p>\n<p>In the face of the CSA's silence on the practice of medicine generally and its recognition of state regulation of the medical profession it is difficult to defend the Attorney General's declaration that the statute impliedly criminalizes physician-assisted suicide. This difficulty is compounded by the CSA's consistent delegation of medical judgments to the Secretary and its otherwise careful allocation of powers for enforcing the limited objects of the CSA. See Part II-B, <i>supra.</i> The Government's attempt to meet this challenge rests, for the most part, on the CSA's requirement that every Schedule II drug be dispensed pursuant to a \"written prescription of a practitioner.\" 21 U.S.C. § 829(a). A prescription, the Government argues, necessarily implies that the substance is being made available to a patient for a legitimate medical purpose. The statute, in this view, requires an anterior judgment about the term \"medical\" or \"medicine.\" The Government contends ordinary usage of these words ineluctably refers to a healing or curative art, which by these terms cannot embrace the intentional hastening of a patient's death. It also points to the teachings of Hippocrates, the positions of prominent medical organizations, the Federal Government, and the judgment of the 49 States that have not legalized physician-assisted suicide as further support for the proposition that the practice is not legitimate medicine. See Brief for Petitioners 22-24; Memorandum from Office of Legal Counsel to Attorney General, App. to Pet. for Cert. 124a-130a.</p>\n<p>On its own, this understanding of medicine's boundaries is at least reasonable. The primary problem with the Government's argument, however, is its assumption that the CSA <span class=\"star-pagination\">*273</span> impliedly authorizes an executive officer to bar a use simply because it may be inconsistent with one reasonable understanding of medical practice. Viewed alone, the prescription requirement may support such an understanding, but statutes \"should not be read as a series of unrelated and isolated provisions.\" <i>Gustafson</i> v. <i>Alloyd Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117902\"><a href=\"/opinion/117902/gustafson-v-alloyd-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span>, 570 (1995). The CSA's substantive provisions and their arrangement undermine this assertion of an expansive federal authority to regulate medicine.</p>\n<p>The statutory criteria for deciding what substances are controlled, determinations which are central to the Act, consistently connect the undefined term \"drug abuse\" with addiction or abnormal effects on the nervous system. When the Attorney General schedules drugs, he must consider a substance's psychic or physiological dependence liability. 21 U.S.C. § 811(c)(7). To classify a substance in Schedules II through V, the Attorney General must find abuse of the drug leads to psychological or physical dependence. § 812(b). Indeed, the differentiation of Schedules II through V turns in large part on a substance's habit-forming potential: The more addictive a substance, the stricter the controls. <i>Ibid.</i> When Congress wanted to extend the CSA's regulation to substances not obviously habit forming or psychotropic, moreover, it relied not on executive ingenuity, but rather on specific legislation. See § 1902(a) of the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 4851 (placing anabolic steroids in Schedule III).</p>\n<p>The statutory scheme with which the CSA is intertwined further confirms a more limited understanding of the prescription requirement. When the Secretary considers Food and Drug Administration approval of a substance with \"stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect,\" he must forward the information to the Attorney General for possible scheduling. Shedding light on Congress' understanding of drug abuse, this requirement appears under the heading \"Abuse <span class=\"star-pagination\">*274</span> potential.\" 21 U.S.C. § 811(f). Similarly, when Congress prepared to implement the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, it did so through the CSA. § 801a.</p>\n<p>The Interpretive Rule rests on a reading of the prescription requirement that is persuasive only to the extent one scrutinizes the provision without the illumination of the rest of the statute. See <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Morash,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112246\"><a href=\"/opinion/112246/massachusetts-v-morash/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 114-115 (1989). Viewed in its context, the prescription requirement is better understood as a provision that ensures patients use controlled substances under the supervision of a doctor so as to prevent addiction and recreational abuse. As a corollary, the provision also bars doctors from peddling to patients who crave the drugs for those prohibited uses. See <i>Moore,</i> 423 U.S., at 135, 143. To read prescriptions for assisted suicide as constituting \"drug abuse\" under the CSA is discordant with the phrase's consistent use throughout the statute, not to mention its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p>The Government's interpretation of the prescription requirement also fails under the objection that the Attorney General is an unlikely recipient of such broad authority, given the Secretary's primacy in shaping medical policy under the CSA, and the statute's otherwise careful allocation of decisionmaking powers. Just as the conventions of expression indicate that Congress is unlikely to alter a statute's obvious scope and division of authority through muffled hints, the background principles of our federal system also belie the notion that Congress would use such an obscure grant of authority to regulate areas traditionally supervised by the States' police power. It is unnecessary even to consider the application of clear statement requirements, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Bass,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108421\"><a href=\"/opinion/108421/united-states-v-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 349 (1971); cf. <i>BFP</i> v. <i>Resolution Trust Corporation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087957\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087957/bfp-v-resolution-trust-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, 544-546 (1994), or presumptions against pre-emption, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Rush Prudential HMO, Inc.</i> v. <i>Moran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121159\"><a href=\"/opinion/121159/rush-prudential-hmo-inc-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span>, 387 (2002), to reach this commonsense conclusion. For all these reasons, we conclude the CSA's prescription requirement does not authorize <span class=\"star-pagination\">*275</span> the Attorney General to bar dispensing controlled substances for assisted suicide in the face of a state medical regime permitting such conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The Government, in the end, maintains that the prescription requirement delegates to a single executive officer the power to effect a radical shift of authority from the States to the Federal Government to define general standards of medical practice in every locality. The text and structure of the CSA show that Congress did not have this far-reaching intent to alter the federal-state balance and the congressional role in maintaining it.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court concludes that the Attorney General lacked authority to declare assisted suicide illicit under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), because the CSA is concerned only with \"<i>illicit</i> drug dealing and trafficking,\" <i>ante,</i> at 270 (emphasis added). This question-begging conclusion is obscured by a flurry of arguments that distort the statute and disregard settled principles of our interpretive jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the Court's analysis, this case involves not one but <i>three</i> independently sufficient grounds for reversing the Ninth Circuit's judgment. First, the Attorney General's interpretation of \"legitimate medical purpose\" in 21 CFR § 1306.04 (2005) (hereinafter Regulation) is clearly valid, given the substantial deference we must accord it under <i>Auer</i> v. <i>Robbins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118089\"><a href=\"/opinion/118089/auer-v-robbins/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 461 (1997), and his two remaining conclusions follow naturally from this interpretation. See Part I, <i>infra.</i> Second, even if this interpretation of the Regulation is entitled to lesser deference or no deference <span class=\"star-pagination\">*276</span> at all, it is by far the most natural interpretation of the Regulationwhose validity is not challenged here. This interpretation is thus correct even upon <i>de novo</i> review. See Part II, <i>infra.</i> Third, even if that interpretation of the Regulation were incorrect, the Attorney General's independent interpretation of the <i>statutory</i> phrase \"public interest\" in 21 U.S.C. §§ 824(a) and 823(f), and his implicit interpretation of the statutory phrase \"public health and safety\" in § 823(f)(5), are entitled to deference under <i>Chevron U.S. A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span> (1984), and they are valid under <i>Chevron.</i> See Part III, <i>infra.</i> For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Interpretive Rule issued by the Attorney General (hereinafter Directive) provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"For the reasons set forth in the OLC Opinion, I hereby determine that assisting suicide is not a `legitimate medical purpose' within the meaning of 21 CFR § 1306.04 (2001), and that prescribing, dispensing, or administering federally controlled substances to assist suicide violates the CSA. Such conduct by a physician registered to dispense controlled substances may `render his registration . . . inconsistent with the public interest' and therefore subject to possible suspension or revocation under 21 U.S.C. [§] 824(a)(4).\" 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (2001).</blockquote>\n<p>The Directive thus purports to do three distinct things: (1) to interpret the phrase \"legitimate medical purpose\" in the Regulation to exclude physician-assisted suicide; (2) to determine that prescribing, dispensing, and administering federally controlled substances to assist suicide violates the CSA; and (3) to determine that participating in physician-assisted suicide may render a practitioner's registration \"inconsistent with the public interest\" within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. §§ 823(f) and 824(a)(4) (which incorporates § 823(f) by reference). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*277</span> The Court's analysis suffers from an unremitting failure to distinguish among these distinct propositions in the Directive.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the validity of the Regulation's interpretation of \"prescription\" in § 829 to require a \"legitimate medical purpose\" is not at issue. Respondents conceded the validity of this interpretation in the lower court, see <i>Oregon</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786296\"><a href=\"/opinion/786296/state-of-oregon-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1118</span></a></span>, 1133 (CA9 2004), and they have not challenged it here. By its assertion that the Regulation merely restates the statutory standard of 21 U.S.C. § 830(b)(3)(A)(ii), see <i>ante,</i> at 257, the Court likewise accepts that the \"legitimate medical purpose\" interpretation for prescriptions is proper. See also <i>ante,</i> at 258 (referring to \"legitimate medical purpose\" as a \"statutory phrase\"). It is beyond dispute, then, that a \"prescription\" under § 829 must issue for a \"legitimate medical purpose.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Because the Regulation was promulgated by the Attorney General, and because the Directive purported to interpret the language of the Regulation, see 66 Fed. Reg. 56608, this case calls for the straightforward application of our rule that an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is \"controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" <i>Auer, supra,</i> at 461 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court reasons that <i>Auer</i> is inapplicable because the Regulation \"does little more than restate the terms of the statute itself.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 257. \"Simply put,\" the Court asserts, \"the existence of a parroting regulation does not change the fact that the question here is not the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>To begin with, it is doubtful that any such exception to the <i>Auer</i> rule exists. The Court cites no authority for it, because there is none. To the contrary, our unanimous decision in <i>Auer</i> makes clear that broadly drawn regulations are entitled to no less respect than narrow ones. \"A rule requiring <span class=\"star-pagination\">*278</span> the Secretary to construe his own regulations narrowly would make little sense, <i>since he is free to write the regulations as broadly as he wishes, subject only to the limits imposed by the statute.\"</i> 519 U.S., at 463 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Even if there were an antiparroting canon, however, it would have no application here. The Court's description of 21 CFR § 1306.04 (2005) as a regulation that merely \"paraphrase[s] the statutory language,\" <i>ante,</i> at 257, is demonstrably false. In relevant part, the Regulation interprets the word \"prescription\" as it appears in 21 U.S.C. § 829, which governs the dispensation of controlled substances other than those on Schedule I (which may not be dispensed at all). Entitled \"[p]rescriptions,\" § 829 requires, with certain exceptions not relevant here, \"the written prescription of a practitioner\" (usually a medical doctor) for the dispensation of Schedule II substances (§ 829(a)), \"a written or oral prescription\" for substances on Schedules III and IV (§ 829(b)), and no prescription but merely a \"medical purpose\" for the dispensation of Schedule V substances (§ 829(c)).</p>\n<p>As used in this section, \"prescription\" is susceptible of at least three reasonable interpretations. First, it might mean any oral or written direction of a practitioner for the dispensation of drugs. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109337\"><a href=\"/opinion/109337/united-states-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span>, 137, n. 13 (1975) (\"On its face § 829 addresses only the form that a prescription must take. . . . [Section] 829 by its terms does not limit the authority of a practitioner\"). Second, in light of the requirement of a \"medical purpose\" for the dispensation of Schedule V substances, see § 829(c), it might mean a practitioner's oral or written direction for the dispensation of drugs that the practitioner believes to be for a legitimate medical purpose. See Webster's New International Dictionary 1954 (2d ed. 1950) (hereinafter Webster's Second) (defining \"prescription\" as \"[a] written direction for the preparation and use of a <i>medicine</i>\"); <i>id.,</i> at 1527 (defining \"medicine\" as \"[a]ny substance or preparation used in <i>treating disease</i>\") (emphasis added). Finally, \"prescription\" might <span class=\"star-pagination\">*279</span> refer to a practitioner's direction for the dispensation of drugs that serves an <i>objectively</i> legitimate medical purpose, regardless of the practitioner's <i>subjective</i> judgment about the legitimacy of the anticipated use. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Regulation at issue constricts or clarifies the statute by adopting the last and narrowest of these three possible interpretations of the undefined statutory term: \"A prescription for a controlled substance to be effective must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose . . . .\" 21 CFR § 1306.04(a) (2005). We have previously <i>acknowledged</i> that the Regulation gives added content to the text of the statute: \"The medical purpose requirement explicit in subsection (c) [of § 829] could be implicit in subsections (a) and (b). Regulation § [1]306.04 makes it explicit.\" <i>Moore, supra,</i> at 137, n. 13.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court points out that the Regulation adopts some of the phrasing employed in unrelated sections of the statute. See <i>ante,</i> at 257. This is irrelevant. A regulation that significantly clarifies the meaning of an otherwise ambiguous statutory provision is not a \"parroting\" regulation, <i>regardless</i> of the sources that the agency draws upon for the clarification. Moreover, most of the statutory phrases that the Court cites as appearing in the Regulation, see <i>ibid.</i> (citing 21 U.S.C. §§ 812(b) (\"`currently accepted medical use'\"), 829(c) (\"`medical purpose'\"), 802(21) (\"`in the course of professional practice'\")), are inapposite because they do <i>not</i> \"parrot\" the <i>only</i> phrase in the Regulation that the Directive purported to construe. See 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (\"I hereby <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> determine that assisting suicide is not a `legitimate medical purpose' within the meaning of 21 CFR § 1306.04 . . .\"). None of them includes the key word \"legitimate,\" which gives the most direct support to the Directive's theory that § 829(c) presupposes a uniform federal standard of medical practice.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Since the Regulation does not run afowl (so to speak) of the Court's newly invented prohibition of \"parroting\"; and since the Directive represents the agency's own interpretation of that concededly valid regulation; the only question remaining is whether that interpretation is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\"; otherwise, it is \"controlling.\" <i>Auer,</i> 519 U.S., at 461 (internal quotation marks omitted). This is not a difficult question. The Directive is assuredly valid insofar as it interprets \"prescription\" to require a medical purpose that is \"legitimate\" as a matter of <i>federal</i> lawsince that is an interpretation of \"prescription\" that we ourselves have adopted. <i>Webb</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99303\"><a href=\"/opinion/99303/webb-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span> (1919), was a prosecution under the Harrison Act of a doctor who wrote prescriptions of morphine \"for the purpose of providing the user with morphine sufficient to keep him comfortable by maintaining his customary use,\" <i>id.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span> at 99 (internal quotation marks omitted). The dispositive issue in the case was whether such authorizations were \"prescriptions\" within the meaning of § 2(b) of the Harrison Act, predecessor to the CSA. <i>Ibid.</i> We held that \"to call such an order for the use of morphine a physician's prescription would be so plain a perversion of meaning that no discussion of the subject is required.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 99-100. Like the Directive, this interprets \"prescription\" to require medical purpose that is legitimate as a matter of federal law. And the Directive is also assuredly valid insofar as it interprets \"legitimate medical purpose\" as a matter of federal law to exclude physician-assisted suicide, because that is not only a permissible but indeed the most natural interpretation of that phrase. See Part II, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Even if the Regulation merely parroted the statute, and the Directive therefore had to be treated as though it construed the statute directly, see <i>ante,</i> at 257, the Directive would still be entitled to deference under <i>Chevron.</i> The Court does not take issue with the Solicitor General's contention that no alleged procedural defect, such as the absence of notice-and-comment rulemaking before promulgation of the Directive, renders <i>Chevron</i> inapplicable here. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 4 (citing <i>Barnhart</i> v. <i>Walton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118493\"><a href=\"/opinion/118493/barnhart-v-walton/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 219-222 (2002); 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(A) (exempting interpretive rules from notice-and-comment rulemaking)). Instead, the Court holds that the Attorney General lacks interpretive authority to issue the Directive at all, on the ground that the explicit delegation provision, 21 U.S.C. § 821 (2000 ed., Supp. V), limits his rulemaking authority to \"registration and control,\" which (according to the Court) are not implicated by the Directive's interpretation of the prescription requirement. See <i>ante,</i> at 259-262.</p>\n<p>Setting aside the implicit delegation inherent in Congress's use of the undefined term \"prescription\" in § 829, the Court's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> reading of \"control\" in § 821 is manifestly erroneous. The Court urges, <i>ante,</i> at 260, that \"control\" is a term defined in part A of the subchapter (entitled \"Introductory Provisions\") to mean \"to add a drug or other substance . . . to a schedule <i>under part B of this subchapter,</i>\" 21 U.S.C. § 802(5) (emphasis added). But § 821 is not included in \"part B of this subchapter,\" which is entitled \"Authority to Control; Standards and Schedules,\" and consists of the sections related to <i>scheduling,</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 811-814 (2000 ed. and Supp. V), where the statutory definition is uniquely appropriate. Rather, § 821 is found in <i>part C</i> of the subchapter, §§ 821-830, entitled \"Registration of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dispensers of Controlled Substances,\" which includes all and only the provisions relating to the \"manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances,\" § 821. The artificial definition of \"control\" in § 802(5) has no conceivable application to the use of that word in § 821. Under that definition, \"control\" must take a <i>substance</i> as its direct object, see 21 U.S.C. § 802(5) (\"to add a drug or other substance . . . to a schedule\")and that is how \"control\" is consistently used throughout <i>part B.</i> See, <i>e. g.,</i> §§ 811(b) (\"proceedings . . . to <i>control</i> a drug or other substance\"), 811(c) (\"each drug or other substance proposed to be <i>controlled</i> or removed from the schedules\"), 811(d)(1) (\"If <i>control</i> is required . . . the Attorney General shall issue an order <i>controlling</i> such drug . . .\"), 812(b) (\"Except where <i>control</i> is required . . . a drug or other substance may not be placed in any schedule . . .\"). In § 821, by contrast, the term \"control\" has as its object, not \"a drug or other substance,\" but rather the <i>processes</i> of \"manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances.\" It could not be clearer that the artificial definition of \"control\" in § 802(5) is inapplicable. It makes no sense to speak of \"adding the manufacturing, distribution, and dispensing of substances to a schedule.\" We do not force term-of-art definitions into contexts where they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense. What <span class=\"star-pagination\">*283</span> is obviously intended in § 821 is the ordinary meaning of \"control\"namely, \"[t]o exercise restraining or directing influence over; to dominate; regulate; hence, to hold from action; to curb,\" Webster's Second 580. \"Control\" is regularly used in this ordinary sense elsewhere in <i>part C</i> of the subchapter. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 823(a)(1), (b)(1), (d)(1), (e)(1), (h)(1) (\"maintenance of effective <i>controls</i> against diversion\"); §§ 823(a)(5), (d)(5) (\"establishment of effective <i>control</i> against diversion\"); § 823(g)(2)(H)(i) (\"to exercise supervision or <i>control</i> over the practice of medicine\"); § 830(b)(1)(C) (\"a listed chemical under the <i>control</i> of the regulated person\"); § 830(c)(2)(D) (\"chemical <i>control</i> laws\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>When the word is given its ordinary meaning, the Attorney General's interpretation of the prescription requirement of § 829 plainly \"relat[es] to the . . . <i>control</i> of the . . . dispensing of controlled substances,\" 21 U.S.C. § 821 (2000 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added), since a prescription is the chief requirement for \"dispensing\" such drugs, see § 829. The same meaning is compelled by the fact that § 821 is the first section not of part B of the subchapter, which deals entirely with \"control\" in the artificial sense, but of part C, every section of which relates to the \"registration and control of the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances,\" § 821. See §§ 822 (persons required to register), 823 (registration requirements), 824 (denial, revocation, or suspension of registration), 825 (labeling and packaging), 826 (production quotas for controlled substances), 827 (recordkeeping and reporting requirements of registrants), 828 (order forms), 829 (prescription requirements), 830 (regulation of listed chemicals and certain machines). It would be peculiar for the first section of this part to authorize rulemaking for matters covered by the <i>previous</i> part. The only sensible interpretation of § 821 is that it gives the Attorney General interpretive authority over the provisions of part C, all of which \"relat[e] to the registration and control of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances.\" These provisions include <i>both</i> the prescription requirement of § 829, and the criteria for registration and deregistration of §§ 823 and 824 (as relevant below, see Part III, <i>infra</i>).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In sum, the Directive's construction of \"legitimate medical purpose\" is a perfectly valid agency interpretation of its own regulation; and if not that, a perfectly valid agency interpretation of the statute. No one contends that the construction is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,\" <i>Bowles</i> v. <i>Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087611\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087611/bowles-v-seminole-rock-sand-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, 414 (1945), or beyond the scope of ambiguity in the statute, see <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S., at 843. In fact, as explained below, the Directive provides <i>the most natural</i> interpretation of the Regulation and of the statute. The Directive thus definitively establishes that a doctor's order authorizing the dispensation of a Schedule II substance for the purpose of assisting a suicide is not a \"prescription\" within the meaning of § 829.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> Once this conclusion is established, the other two conclusions in the Directive follow inevitably. Under our reasoning in <i>Moore,</i> writing prescriptions that are illegitimate under § 829 is certainly not \"in the [usual] course of professional practice\" under § 802(21) and thus not \"authorized by this subchapter\" under § 841(a). See 423 U.S., at 138, 140-141. A doctor who does this may thus be prosecuted under § 841(a), and so it follows that such conduct \"violates the Controlled Substances Act,\" 66 Fed. Reg. 56608. And since such conduct is thus not in \"[c]ompliance with applicable . . . Federal . . . laws relating to controlled substances,\" 21 U.S.C. § 823(f)(4), and may also be fairly judged to \"threaten the public health and safety,\" § 823(f)(5), it follows that \"[s]uch conduct by a physician registered to dispense controlled substances <i>may</i> `render his registration . . . inconsistent with the public interest' and therefore subject to <i>possible</i> suspension or revocation under 21 U.S.C. [§] 824(a)(4),\" 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Even if the Directive were entitled to no deference whatever, the most reasonable interpretation of the Regulation and of the statute would produce the same result. Virtually every relevant source of authoritative meaning confirms that the phrase \"legitimate medical purpose\"<sup>[4]</sup> does not include intentionally assisting suicide. \"Medicine\" refers to \"[t]he science and art dealing with the prevention, cure, or alleviation of disease.\" Webster's Second 1527. The use of the word \"legitimate\" connotes an <i>objective</i> standard of \"medicine,\" and our presumption that the CSA creates a uniform federal law regulating the dispensation of controlled substances, see <i>Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians</i> v. <i>Holyfield,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112241\"><a href=\"/opinion/112241/mississippi-band-of-choctaw-indians-v-holyfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 43 (1989), means that this objective standard must be a federal one. As recounted in detail in the memorandum for the Attorney General that is attached as an appendix to the Directive (OLC Memo), virtually every medical authority from Hippocrates to the current American Medical Association (AMA) confirms that assisting suicide has seldom or never been viewed as a form of \"prevention, cure, or alleviation of disease,\" and (even more so) that assisting suicide is not a \"legitimate\" branch of that \"science and art.\" See OLC Memo, App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a-130a. Indeed, the AMA has determined that \"`[p]hysician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.'\" <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Glucksberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118144\"><a href=\"/opinion/118144/washington-v-glucksberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span>, 731 (1997). \"[T]he overwhelming weight of authority in judicial decisions, the past and present policies of nearly all of the States and of the Federal Government, and the clear, firm and unequivocal views of the leading associations within the American medical and nursing professions, establish that assisting in suicide . . . is not a legitimate medical purpose.\" OLC Memo, <i>supra,</i> at 129a. See also <i>Glucksberg, supra,</i> at 710, n. 8 (prohibitions or condemnations of assisted suicide in 50 jurisdictions, including 47 States, the District of Columbia, and 2 Territories).</p>\n<p>In the face of this \"overwhelming weight of authority,\" the Court's admission that \"[o]n its own, this understanding of medicine's boundaries is <i>at least reasonable,\" ante,</i> at 272 (emphasis added), tests the limits of understatement. The only explanation for such a distortion is that the Court confuses the <i>normative</i> inquiry of what the boundaries of medicine <i>should be</i>which it is laudably hesitant to undertake with the <i>objective</i> inquiry of what the accepted definition of \"medicine\" <i>is.</i> The same confusion is reflected in the Court's remarkable statement that \"[t]he primary problem with the Government's argument . . . is its assumption that the CSA impliedly authorizes an executive officer to bar a use simply <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> because it may be inconsistent with <i>one reasonable understanding</i> of medical practice.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 272-273 (emphasis added). The fact that many in Oregon believe that the boundaries of \"legitimate medicine\" <i>should be</i> extended to include assisted suicide does not change the fact that the overwhelming weight of authority (including the 47 States that condemn physician-assisted suicide) confirms that they have not yet been so extended. Not even those of our Eighth Amendment cases most generous in discerning an \"evolution\" of national standards would have found, on this record, that the concept of \"legitimate medicine\" has evolved so far. See <i>Roper</i> v. <i>Simmons,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137749\"><a href=\"/opinion/137749/roper-v-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span>, 564-567 (2005).</p>\n<p>The Court contends that the phrase \"legitimate medical purpose\" <i>cannot</i> be read to establish a broad, uniform federal standard for the medically proper use of controlled substances. <i>Ante,</i> at 268. But it also rejects the most plausible alternative proposition, urged by the State, that any use authorized under state law constitutes a \"legitimate medical purpose.\" (The Court is perhaps leery of embracing this position because the State candidly admitted at oral argument that, on its view, a State could exempt from the CSA's coverage the use of morphine to achieve euphoria.) Instead, the Court reverse-engineers an approach somewhere between a uniform national standard and a state-by-state approach, holding (with no basis in the CSA's text) that \"legitimate medical purpose\" refers to <i>all</i> uses of drugs unrelated to \"addiction and recreational abuse.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 274. Thus, though the Court pays lipservice to state autonomy, see <i>ante,</i> at 269-271, its standard for \"legitimate medical purpose\" is in fact a hazily defined <i>federal</i> standard based on its purposive reading of the CSA, and extracted from obliquely relevant sections of the Act. In particular, relying on its observation that the criteria for scheduling controlled substances are primarily concerned with \"addiction or abnormal effects on the nervous system,\" <i>ante,</i> at 273 (citing 21 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> U.S.C. §§ 811(c)(7), 812(b), 811(f), 801a), the Court concludes that the CSA's prescription requirement must be interpreted in light of this narrow view of the statute's purpose.</p>\n<p>Even assuming, however, that the <i>principal</i> concern of the CSA is the curtailment of \"addiction and recreational abuse,\" there is no reason to think that this is its <i>exclusive</i> concern. We have repeatedly observed that Congress often passes statutes that sweep more broadly than the main problem they were designed to address. \"[S]tatutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\" <i>Oncale</i> v. <i>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118181\"><a href=\"/opinion/118181/oncale-v-sundowner-offshore-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 79 (1998). See also <i>H. J. Inc.</i> v. <i>Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 248 (1989).</p>\n<p>The scheduling provisions of the CSA on which the Court relies confirm that the CSA's \"design,\" <i>ante,</i> at 269, is not as narrow as the Court asserts. In making scheduling determinations, the Attorney General must not only consider a drug's \"psychic or physiological dependence liability\" as the Court points out, <i>ante,</i> at 273 (citing 21 U.S.C. § 811(c)(7)), but must also consider such broad factors as \"[t]he state of current scientific knowledge regarding the drug or other substance,\" § 811(c)(3), and (most notably) \"[w]hat, if any, risk there is to the public health,\" § 811(c)(6). If the latter factor were limited to addiction-related health risks, as the Court supposes, it would be redundant of § 811(c)(7). Moreover, in making registration determinations regarding manufacturers and distributors, the Attorney General \"shall\" consider \"such <i>other</i> factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety,\" §§ 823(a)(6), (b)(5), (d)(6), (e)(5) (emphasis added)over and above the risk of \"diversion\" of controlled substances, §§ 823(a)(1), (a)(5), (b)(1), (d)(1), (d)(5), (e)(1). And, most relevant of all, in registering and deregistering <i>physicians,</i> the Attorney General \"may deny an application <span class=\"star-pagination\">*289</span> for such registration if he determines that the issuance of such registration would be inconsistent with the public interest,\" § 823(f); see also § 824(a)(4), and in making that determination \"shall\" consider \"[s]uch other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety,\" § 823(f)(5). <i>All</i> of these provisions, not just those selectively cited by the Court, shed light upon the CSA's repeated references to the undefined term \"abuse.\" See §§ 811(a)(1)(A), (c)(1), (c)(4), (c)(5); §§ 812(b)(1)(A), (b)(2)(A), (b)(3)(A), (b)(4)(A), (b)(5)(A).</p>\n<p>By disregarding all these public-interest, public-health, and public-safety objectives, and limiting the CSA to \"addiction and recreational abuse,\" the Court rules out the prohibition of anabolic-steroid use for bodybuilding purposes. It seeks to avoid this consequence by invoking the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 4851. <i>Ante,</i> at 273. But the only effect of that legislation is to make anabolic steroids controlled drugs under Schedule III of the CSA. If the only <i>basis</i> for control is (as the Court says) \"addiction and recreational abuse,\" dispensation of these drugs for bodybuilding could not be proscribed.</p>\n<p>Although, as I have described, the Court's opinion no more defers to state law than does the Directive, the Court relies on two provisions for the conclusion that \"[t]he structure and operation of the CSA presume and rely upon a functioning medical profession regulated under the States' police powers,\" <i>ante,</i> at 270namely, the registration provisions of § 823(f) and the nonpre-emption provision of § 903. Reliance on the former is particularly unfortunate, because the Court's own analysis recounts how Congress amended § 823(f) in 1984 in order to <i>liberate</i> the Attorney General's power over registration from the control of state regulators. See <i>ante,</i> at 261; 21 U.S.C. § 823(f); see also Brief for Petitioners 34-35. And the nonpre-emption clause is embarrassingly inapplicable, since it merely disclaims field pre-emption, and affirmatively <i>prescribes</i> federal pre-emption <span class=\"star-pagination\">*290</span> whenever state law creates a conflict.<sup>[5]</sup> In any event, the Directive does not purport to pre-empt state law in any way, not even by conflict pre-emptionunless the Court is under the misimpression that some States <i>require</i> assisted suicide. The Directive merely interprets the CSA to prohibit, like countless other federal criminal provisions, conduct that happens not to be forbidden under state law (or at least the law of the State of Oregon).</p>\n<p>With regard to the CSA's registration provisions, 21 U.S.C. §§ 823(f), 824(a), the Court argues that the statute cannot fairly be read to \"`hide elephants in mouseholes'\" by delegating to the Attorney General the power to determine the legitimacy of medical practices in \"`vague terms or ancillary provisions.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 267 (quoting <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118410\"><a href=\"/opinion/118410/whitman-v-american-trucking-assns-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 468 (2001)). This case bears not the remotest resemblance to <i>Whitman,</i> which held that \"Congress . . . does not alter <i>the fundamental details</i> of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). The Attorney General's power to issue regulations against questionable uses of controlled substances in no way alters \"the fundamental details\" of the CSA. I am aware of only four areas in which the Department of Justice has exercised that power to regulate uses of controlled substances <i>unrelated</i> to \"addiction and recreational abuse\" as the Court apparently understands that phrase: assisted suicide, aggressive pain management therapy, anabolic-steroid use, and cosmetic weight-loss therapy. See, <i>e. g., In re Harline,</i> 65 Fed. Reg. 5665, 5667 (2000) (weight loss); <i>In re Tecca,</i> 62 Fed. Reg. 12842, 12846 (1997) (anabolic steroids); <i>In re Roth,</i> 60 Fed. Reg. 62262, 62263, 62267 (1995) (pain management). There is no indication that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> enforcement in these areas interferes with the prosecution of \"drug abuse\" as the Court understands it. Unlike in <i>Whitman,</i> the Attorney General's <i>additional</i> power to address other forms of drug \"abuse\" does <i>absolutely nothing</i> to undermine the central features of this regulatory scheme. Of course it was critical to our analysis in <i>Whitman</i> that the language of the provision did not bear the meaning that respondents sought to give it. See 531 U.S., at 465. Here, for the reasons stated above, the provision is most naturally interpreted to incorporate a uniform federal standard for legitimacy of medical practice.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, respondents argue that the Attorney General must defer to state-law judgments about what constitutes legitimate medicine, on the ground that Congress must speak clearly to impose such a uniform federal standard upon the States. But no line of our clear-statement cases is applicable here. The canon of avoidance does not apply, since the Directive does not push the outer limits of Congress's commerce power, compare <i>Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.</i> v. <i>Army Corps of Engineers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118396\"><a href=\"/opinion/118396/solid-waste-agency-of-northern-cook-cty-v-army-cor/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span>, 172 (2001) (regulation of isolated ponds), with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sullivan,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></span>, 698 (1948) (regulation of labeling of drugs shipped in interstate commerce), or impinge on a core aspect of state sovereignty, cf. <i>Atascadero State Hospital</i> v. <i>Scanlon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111503\"><a href=\"/opinion/111503/atascadero-state-hospital-v-scanlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span>, 242 (1985) (sovereign immunity); <i>Gregory</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112632\"><a href=\"/opinion/112632/gregory-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 460 (1991) (qualifications of state government officials). The clear-statement rule based on the presumption against pre-emption does not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> apply because the Directive does not pre-empt any state law, cf. <i>id.,</i> at 456-457; <i>Rush Prudential HMO, Inc.</i> v. <i>Moran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121159\"><a href=\"/opinion/121159/rush-prudential-hmo-inc-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span>, 359 (2002). And finally, no clear statement is required on the ground that the Directive intrudes upon an area traditionally reserved exclusively to the States, cf. <i>BFP</i> v. <i>Resolution Trust Corporation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087957\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087957/bfp-v-resolution-trust-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, 544 (1994) (state regulation of titles to real property), because the Federal Government has pervasively regulated the dispensation of drugs for over 100 years. See generally Brief for Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 3-15. It would be a novel and massive expansion of the clear-statement rule to apply it in a commerce case <i>not involving pre-emption or constitutional avoidance,</i> merely because Congress has chosen to prohibit conduct that a State has made a contrary policy judgment to permit. See <i>Sullivan, supra,</i> at 693.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Even if the Regulation did not exist and \"prescription\" in § 829 could not be interpreted to require a \"legitimate medical purpose,\" the Directive's conclusion that \"prescribing, dispensing, or administering federally controlled substances. . . by a physician . . . may `render his registration . . . inconsistent with the public interest' and therefore subject to possible suspension or revocation under 21 U.S.C. [§] 824(a)(4),\" 66 Fed. Reg. 56608, would nevertheless be unassailable in this Court.</p>\n<p>Sections 823(f) and 824(a) explicitly grant the Attorney General the authority to register and deregister physicians, and his discretion in exercising that authority is spelled out in very broad terms. He may refuse to register or deregister if he determines that registration is \"inconsistent with the public interest,\" 21 U.S.C. § 823(f), after considering five factors, the fifth of which is \"[s]uch other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety,\" § 823(f)(5). See also <i>In re Arora,</i> 60 Fed. Reg. 4447, 4448 (1995) (\"It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> i. e., the Deputy Administrator may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate\"). As the Court points out, these broad standards were enacted in the 1984 amendments for the specific purpose of <i>freeing</i> the Attorney General's discretion over registration from the decisions of state authorities. See <i>ante,</i> at 261.</p>\n<p>The fact that assisted-suicide prescriptions are issued in violation of § 829 is of course sufficient to support the Directive's conclusion that issuing them may be cause for deregistration: such prescriptions would violate the fourth factor of § 823(f), namely, \"[c]ompliance with applicable . . . Federal . . . laws relating to controlled substances,\" 21 U.S.C. § 823(f)(4). But the Attorney General did not rely solely on subsection (f)(4) in reaching his conclusion that registration would be \"inconsistent with the public interest\"; nothing in the text of the Directive indicates that. Subsection (f)(5) (\"[s]uch other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety\") provides an independent, alternative basis for the Directive's conclusion regarding deregistrationprovided that the Attorney General has authority to interpret \"public interest\" and \"public health and safety\" in § 823(f) to exclude assisted suicide.</p>\n<p>Three considerations make it perfectly clear that the statute confers authority to interpret these phrases upon the Attorney General. First, the Attorney General is solely and explicitly charged with administering the registration and deregistration provisions. See §§ 823(f), 824(a). By making the criteria for such registration and deregistration such obviously ambiguous factors as \"public interest\" and \"public health and safety,\" Congress implicitly (but clearly) gave the Attorney General authority to interpret those criteria <i>whether or not</i> there is any explicit delegation provision in the statute. \"Sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit. In such a case, a court may not substitute its own <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S., at 844. The Court's exclusive focus on the <i>explicit</i> delegation provisions is, at best, a fossil of our pre-<i>Chevron</i> era; at least since <i>Chevron,</i> we have not conditioned our deferral to agency interpretations upon the existence of explicit delegation provisions. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mead Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 229 (2001), left this principle of implicit delegation intact.</p>\n<p>Second, even if explicit delegation were required, Congress provided it in § 821, which authorizes the Attorney General to \"promulgate rules and regulations . . . relating to the <i>registration and control</i> of the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) Because \"dispensing\" refers to the delivery of a controlled substance \"pursuant to the lawful order of, a practitioner,\" 21 U.S.C. § 802(10), the deregistration of such practitioners for writing impermissible orders \"relat[es] to the registration . . . of the . . . dispensing\" of controlled substances, 21 U.S.C. § 821 (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>Third, § 821 also gives the Attorney General authority to promulgate rules and regulations \"relating to the . . . control of the . . . dispensing of controlled substances.\" As discussed earlier, it is plain that the <i>ordinary</i> meaning of \"control\" must apply to § 821, so that the plain import of the provision is to grant the Attorney General rulemaking authority over all the provisions of part C of the CSA, §§ 821-830 (main ed. and Supp. 2005). Registering and deregistering the practitioners who issue the prescriptions necessary for lawful dispensation of controlled substances plainly \"relat[es] to the . . . control of the . . . dispensing of controlled substances.\" § 821 (Supp. 2005).</p>\n<p>The Attorney General is thus authorized to promulgate regulations interpreting §§ 823(f) and 824(a), both by implicit delegation in § 823(f) and by two grounds of explicit delegation in § 821. The Court nevertheless holds that this triply <span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> unambiguous delegation cannot be given full effect because \"the design of the statute,\" <i>ante,</i> at 265, evinces the intent to grant the Secretary of Health and Human Services exclusive authority over scientific and medical determinations. This proposition is not remotely plausible. The Court cites as authority for the Secretary's exclusive authority two specific areas in which his medical determinations are said to be binding on the Attorney Generalwith regard to the \"scientific and medical evaluation\" of a drug's effects that precedes its scheduling, § 811(b), and with regard to \"the appropriate methods of professional practice in the medical treatment of the narcotic addiction of various classes of narcotic addicts,\" 42 U.S.C. § 290bb-2a; see also 21 U.S.C. § 823(g) (2000 ed. and Supp. II). See <i>ante,</i> at 265-266. Far from establishing a general principle of Secretary supremacy with regard to all scientific and medical determinations, the fact that Congress granted the Secretary specifically defined authority in the areas of scheduling and addiction treatment, <i>without otherwise mentioning him</i> in the registration provisions, suggests, to the contrary, that Congress envisioned <i>no</i> role for the Secretary in that areawhere, as we have said, interpretive authority was both implicitly and explicitly conferred upon the Attorney General.</p>\n<p>Even if we could rewrite statutes to accord with sensible \"design,\" it is far from a certainty that the Secretary, rather than the Attorney General, ought to control the registration of physicians. Though registration decisions sometimes require judgments about the legitimacy of medical practices, the Department of Justice has seemingly had no difficulty making them. See <i>In re Harline,</i> 65 Fed. Reg. 5665; <i>In re Tecca,</i> 62 Fed. Reg. 12842; <i>In re Roth,</i> 60 Fed. Reg. 62262. But unlike decisions about whether a substance should be scheduled or whether a narcotics addiction treatment is legitimate, registration decisions are not exclusively, or even primarily, concerned with \"medical [and] scientific\" factors. See 21 U.S.C. § 823(f). Rather, the decision to register, or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> to bring an action to deregister, an individual <i>physician</i> implicates all the policy goals and competing enforcement priorities that attend any exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is entirely reasonable to think (as Congress evidently did) that it would be easier for the Attorney General occasionally to make judgments about the legitimacy of medical practices than it would be for the Secretary to get into the business of law enforcement. It is, in other words, perfectly consistent with an intelligent \"design of the statute\" to give the Nation's chief law enforcement official, not its chief health official, broad discretion over the substantive standards that govern registration and deregistration. That is <i>especially</i> true where the contested \"scientific and medical\" judgment at issue has to do with the legitimacy of physician-assisted suicide, which ultimately rests, not on \"science\" or \"medicine,\" but on a naked value judgment. It no more depends upon a \"quintessentially medical judgmen[t],\" <i>ante,</i> at 267, than does the legitimacy of polygamy or eugenic infanticide. And it requires no particular <i>medical</i> training to undertake the objective inquiry into how the continuing traditions of Western medicine have consistently treated this subject. See OLC Memo, App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a-130a. The Secretary's supposedly superior \"medical expertise\" to make \"medical judgments,\" <i>ante,</i> at 266, is strikingly irrelevant to the case at hand.</p>\n<p>The Court also reasons that, even if the CSA grants the Attorney General authority to interpret § 823(f), the Directive does not purport to exercise that authority, because it \"does not undertake the five-factor analysis\" of § 823(f) and does not \"on its face purport to be an <i>application</i> of the registration provision in § 823(f).\" <i>Ante,</i> at 261 (emphasis added). This reasoning is sophistic. It would be improperindeed, <i>impossible</i>for the Attorney General to \"undertake the five-factor analysis\" of § 823(f) and to \"appl[y] the registration provision\" outside the context of an actual enforcement proceeding. But of course the Attorney General <span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span> may issue regulations to clarify his interpretation of the five factors, and to signal how he will apply them in future enforcement proceedings. That is what the Directive plainly purports to do by citing § 824(a)(4), and that is why the Directive's conclusion on deregistration is couched in conditional terms: \"Such conduct by a physician . . . <i>may</i> `render his registration . . . inconsistent with the public interest' and therefore subject to <i>possible</i> suspension or revocation under 21 U.S.C. [§] 824(a)(4).\" 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>It follows from what we have said that the Attorney General's authoritative interpretations of \"public interest\" and \"public health and safety\" in § 823(f) are subject to <i>Chevron</i> deference. As noted earlier, the Court does not contest that the absence of notice-and-comment procedures for the Directive renders <i>Chevron</i> inapplicable. And there is no serious argument that \"Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\" or that the Directive's interpretations of \"public health and safety\" and \"inconsistent with the public interest\" are not \"permissible.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S., at 842-843. On the latter point, in fact, the condemnation of assisted suicide by 50 American jurisdictions supports the Attorney General's view. The Attorney General may therefore weigh a physician's participation in assisted suicide as a factor counseling against his registration, or in favor of deregistration, under § 823(f).</p>\n<p>In concluding to the contrary, the Court merely presents the conclusory assertion that \"it is doubtful the Attorney General could cite the `public interest' or `public health' to deregister a physician simply because he deemed a controversial practice permitted by state law to have an illegitimate medical purpose.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 264. But why on earth not?especially when he has interpreted the relevant statutory factors in advance to give fair warning that such a practice is \"inconsistent with the public interest.\" The Attorney General's discretion to determine the public interest in this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*298</span> area is admittedly broadbut certainly no broader than other congressionally conferred executive powers that we have upheld in the past. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>National Broadcasting Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103835\"><a href=\"/opinion/103835/nat-broadcasting-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span>, 216-217 (1943) (\"public interest\"); <i>New York Central Securities Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101954\"><a href=\"/opinion/101954/new-york-central-securities-corporation-v-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 24-25 (1932) (same); see also <i>Mistretta</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112173\"><a href=\"/opinion/112173/mistretta-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 415-416 (1989) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>In sum, the Directive's first conclusionnamely, that physician-assisted suicide is not a \"legitimate medical purpose\"is supported both by the deference we owe to the agency's interpretation of its own regulations and by the deference we owe to its interpretation of the statute. The other two conclusions(2) that prescribing controlled drugs to assist suicide violates the CSA, and (3) that such conduct is also \"inconsistent with the public interest\"are inevitable consequences of that first conclusion. Moreover, the third conclusion, standing alone, is one that the Attorney General is authorized to make.</p>\n<p>The Court's decision today is perhaps driven by a feeling that the subject of assisted suicide is none of the Federal Government's business. It is easy to sympathize with that position. The prohibition or deterrence of assisted suicide is certainly not among the enumerated powers conferred on the United States by the Constitution, and it is within the realm of public morality <i>(bonos mores)</i> traditionally addressed by the so-called police power of the States. But then, neither is prohibiting the recreational use of drugs or discouraging drug addiction among the enumerated powers. From an early time in our national history, the Federal Government has used its enumerated powers, such as its power to regulate interstate commerce, for the purpose of protecting public moralityfor example, by banning the interstate shipment of lottery tickets, or the interstate transport of women for immoral purposes. See <i>Hoke</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*299</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97782\"><a href=\"/opinion/97782/hoke-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 321-323 (1913); <i>Lottery Case,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2421240\"><a href=\"/opinion/2421240/lottery-case/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, 356 (1903). Unless we are to repudiate a long and well-established principle of our jurisprudence, using the federal commerce power to prevent assisted suicide is unquestionably permissible. The question before us is not whether Congress <i>can</i> do this, or even whether Congress <i>should</i> do this; but simply whether Congress <i>has</i> done this in the CSA. I think there is no doubt that it has. If the term \"<i>legitimate</i> medical purpose\" has any meaning, it surely excludes the prescription of drugs to produce death.</p>\n<p>For the above reasons, I respectfully dissent from the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>When Angel Raich and Diane Monson challenged the application of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. § 801 <i>et seq.,</i> to their purely intrastate possession of marijuana for medical use as authorized under California law, a majority of this Court (a mere seven months ago) determined that the CSA effectively invalidated California's law because \"the CSA is a comprehensive regulatory regime specifically designed to regulate which controlled substances can be utilized for medicinal purposes, <i>and in what manner.\" </i><i>Gonzales</i> v. <i>Raich,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799995\"><a href=\"/opinion/799995/gonzales-v-raich/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 27 (2005) (emphasis added). The majority employed unambiguous language, concluding that the \"manner\" in which controlled substances can be utilized \"for medicinal purposes\" is one of the \"core activities regulated by the CSA.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 28. And, it described the CSA as \"creating a comprehensive framework for regulating the production, distribution, and possession of . . . `controlled substances,'\" including those substances that \"`have a useful and legitimate medical purpose,'\" in order to \"foster the beneficial use of those medications\" and \"to prevent their misuse.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 24.</p>\n<p>Today the majority beats a hasty retreat from these conclusions. Confronted with a regulation that broadly requires <span class=\"star-pagination\">*300</span> all prescriptions to be issued for a \"legitimate medical purpose,\" 21 CFR § 1306.04(a) (2005), a regulation recognized in <i>Raich</i> as part of the Federal Government's \"closed . . . system\" for regulating the \"manner\" in \"which controlled substances can be utilized for medicinal purposes,\" 545 U.S., at 13, 27, the majority rejects the Attorney General's admittedly \"at least reasonable,\" <i>ante,</i> at 272, determination that administering controlled substances to facilitate a patient's death is not a \"`legitimate medical purpose.'\" The majority does so based on its conclusion that the CSA is only concerned with the regulation of \"medical practice insofar as it bars doctors from using their prescription-writing powers as a means to engage in illicit drug dealing and trafficking as conventionally understood.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 270. In other words, in stark contrast to <i>Raich'</i>s broad conclusions about the scope of the CSA as it pertains to the medicinal use of controlled substances, today this Court concludes that the CSA is merely concerned with fighting \"`drug abuse'\" and only insofar as that abuse leads to \"addiction or abnormal effects on the nervous system.\"<sup>[1]</sup><i>Ante,</i> at 273.</p>\n<p>The majority's newfound understanding of the CSA as a statute of limited reach is all the more puzzling because it rests upon constitutional principles that the majority of the Court rejected in <i>Raich.</i> Notwithstanding the States' \"`traditional police powers to define the criminal law and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens,'\" 545 U.S., at 30, n. 38, the <i>Raich</i> majority concluded that the CSA applied to the intrastate possession of marijuana for medicinal purposes authorized by California law because \"Congress could have rationally\" concluded that such an application was necessary to the regulation of the \"larger interstate marijuana market.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 30, 32. Here, by contrast, the majority's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> restrictive interpretation of the CSA is based in no small part on \"the structure and limitations of federalism, which allow the States `\"great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.\"'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 270 (quoting <i>Medtronic, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lohr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118055\"><a href=\"/opinion/118055/medtronic-inc-v-lohr/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 475 (1996), in turn quoting <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111438\"><a href=\"/opinion/111438/metropolitan-life-ins-co-v-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span>, 756 (1985)). According to the majority, these \"background principles of our federal system . . . belie the notion that Congress would use . . . an obscure grant of authority to regulate areas traditionally supervised by the States' police power.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 274.</p>\n<p>Of course there is nothing \"obscure\" about the CSA's grant of authority to the Attorney General. <i>Ante,</i> p. 275 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). And, the Attorney General's conclusion that the CSA prohibits the States from authorizing physician assisted suicide is admittedly \"at least reasonable,\" <i>ante,</i> at 272 (opinion of the Court), and is therefore entitled to deference. <i>Ante,</i> at 284-285 (Scalia, J., dissenting). While the scope of the CSA and the Attorney General's power thereunder are sweeping, and perhaps troubling, such expansive federal legislation and broad grants of authority to administrative agencies are merely the inevitable and inexorable consequence of this Court's Commerce Clause and separation-ofpowers jurisprudence. See, <i>e. g., Raich, supra; </i><i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118410\"><a href=\"/opinion/118410/whitman-v-american-trucking-assns-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span> (2001).</p>\n<p>I agree with limiting the applications of the CSA in a manner consistent with the principles of federalism and our constitutional structure. <i>Raich, supra,</i> at 74 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); cf. <i>Whitman, supra,</i> at 486-487 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (noting constitutional concerns with broad delegations of authority to administrative agencies). But that is now water over the dam. The relevance of such considerations was at its zenith in <i>Raich,</i> when we considered whether the CSA could be applied to the intrastate possession of a controlled substance consistent with the limited federal powers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*302</span> enumerated by the Constitution. Such considerations have little, if any, relevance where, as here, we are merely presented with a question of statutory interpretation, and not the extent of constitutionally permissible federal power. This is particularly true where, as here, we are interpreting broad, straightforward language within a statutory framework that a majority of this Court has concluded is so comprehensive that it necessarily nullifies the States' \"`traditional . . . powers . . . to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens.'\"<sup>[2]</sup><i>Raich, supra,</i> at 30, n. 38. The Court's reliance upon the constitutional principles that it rejected in <i>Raich</i>albeit under the guise of statutory interpretation is perplexing to say the least.

See <i>Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians</i> v. <i>Holyfield,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112241\"><a href=\"/opinion/112241/mississippi-band-of-choctaw-indians-v-holyfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 43 (1989) (\"We start . . . with the general assumption that in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary, . . . Congress when it enacts a statute is not making the application of the federal act dependent on state law\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>[2]  The only place outside 21 U.S.C. § 801 in which the statute uses the phrase \"legitimate medical purpose\" is in defining the phrase \"valid prescription\" for purposes of the reporting requirements that apply to mail orders of regulated substances. See § 830(b)(3)(A)(ii). The Regulation did not \"parrot\" this statutory section, because the Regulation was adopted in 1971 and the statutory language was added in 2000. See Brief for Petitioners 17 (citing the Children's Health Act of 2000, § 3652, 114 Stat. 1239, 21 U.S.C. § 830(b)(3)). But even if the statutory language had predated the Regulation, there would be no \"parroting\" of that phrase. In using the word \"prescription\" <i>without</i> definition in the much more critical § 829, Congress left the task of resolving any ambiguity in that word, used in that context, to the relevant executive officer. That the officer did so by deeming relevant a technically inapplicable statutory definition contained elsewhere in the statute does not make him a parrot. He has given to the statutory text a meaning it did not explicitlyand perhaps even not necessarilycontain.</p>\n<p>[3]  The Court concludes that \"[e]ven if `control' in § 821 were understood to signify something other than its statutory definition, it would not support the Interpretive Rule.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 260. That conclusion rests upon a misidentification of the text that the Attorney General, pursuant to his \"control\" authority, is interpreting. No one argues that the word \"control\" in § 821 gives the Attorney General \"authority to define diversion based on his view of legitimate medical practice,\" <i>ibid.</i> Rather, that word authorizes the Attorney General to interpret (among other things) the \"prescription\" requirement of § 829. The question then becomes whether the phrase <i>\"legitimate medical purpose\"</i> (which all agree is included in \"prescription\") is at least <i>open</i> to the interpretation announced in the Directive. See <i>Chevron U.S. A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843 (1984). And of course it isas the Court effectively concedes two pages earlier: \"All would agree, we should think, that the statutory phrase `legitimate medical purpose' is a generality, susceptible to more precise definition and open to varying constructions, and thus ambiguous in the relevant sense.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 258 (citing <i>Chevron</i>).</p>\n<p>[4]  This phrase appears only in the Regulation and not in the relevant section of the statute. But as pointed out earlier, the Court does not contest that this is the most reasonable interpretation of the section regarding it, indeed, as a mere \"parroting\" of the statute.</p>\n<p>[5]  Title 21 U.S.C. § 903 reads, in relevant part, as follows: \"No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which that provision operates, including criminal penalties, to the exclusion of any State law on the same subject matter . . . unless there is a positive conflict . . . .\"</p>\n<p>[6]  The other case cited by the Court, <i>FDA</i> v. <i>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118347\"><a href=\"/opinion/118347/fda-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span> (2000), is even more obviously inapt. There we relied on the first step of the <i>Chevron</i> analysis to determine that Congress had spoken to the precise issue in question, impliedly repealing the grant of jurisdiction on which the Food and Drug Administration relied. 529 U.S., at 160-161. Here, Congress has not expressly or impliedly authorized the practice of assisted suicide, or indeed \"spoken directly\" to the subject in any way beyond the text of the CSA.</p>\n<p>[1]  The majority does not expressly address whether the ingestion of a quantity of drugs that is sufficient to cause death has an \"abnormal effec[t] on the nervous system,\" <i>ante,</i> at 273, though it implicitly rejects such a conclusion.</p>\n<p>[2]  Notably, respondents have not seriously pressed a constitutional claim here, conceding at oral argument that their \"point is not necessarily that [the CSA] would be unconstitutional.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 44. In any event, to the extent respondents do present a constitutional claim, they do so solely within the framework of <i>Raich.</i> Framed in this manner, the claim must fail. The respondents in <i>Raich</i> were \"local growers and users of state-authorized, medical marijuana,\" who stood \"outside the interstate drug market\" and possessed \"`medicinal marijuana . . . not intended for . . . the stream of commerce.'\" 545 U.S., at 62, 72 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Here, by contrast, the respondent-physicians are active participants in the interstate controlled substances market, and the drugs they prescribe for assisting suicide have likely traveled in interstate commerce. If the respondents in <i>Raich</i> could not sustain a constitutional claim, then <i>a fortiori</i> respondents here cannot sustain one. Respondents' acceptance of <i>Raich</i> forecloses their constitutional challenge.</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 145693, "judges": "Kennedy", "local_path": "pdf/2006/01/17/Gonzales_v._Oregon.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2005                                       1\r\n\r\n                                       Syllabus\r\n\r\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\r\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\r\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\r\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\r\n       See United States v.

OREGON\r\n                  ET AL.\r\n\r\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\r\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\r\n\r\n    No. 04–623.     Argued October 5, 2005—Decided January 17, 2006\r\nThe Controlled Substances Act (CSA or Act), which was enacted in\r\n  1970 with the main objectives of combating drug abuse and control-\r\n  ling legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances,\r\n  criminalizes, inter alia, the unauthorized distribution and dispensa-\r\n  tion of substances classified in any of its five schedules. The Attorney\r\n  General may add, remove, or reschedule substances only after mak-\r\n  ing particular findings, and on scientific and medical matters, he\r\n  must accept the findings of the Secretary of Health and Human Ser-\r\n  vices (Secretary). These proceedings must be on the record after an\r\n  opportunity for comment. The dispute here involves controlled sub-\r\n  stances listed in Schedule II, which are generally available only by\r\n  written prescription, 21 U. S. C. §829(a). A 1971 regulation promul-\r\n  gated by the Attorney General requires that such prescriptions be\r\n  used “for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner\r\n  acting in the usual course of his professional practice.” 21 CFR\r\n  §1306.04. To prevent diversion of controlled substances, the CSA\r\n  regulates the activity of physicians, who must register in accordance\r\n  with rules and regulations promulgated by the Attorney General. He\r\n  may deny, suspend, or revoke a registration that, as relevant here,\r\n  would be “inconsistent with the public interest.”            21 U. S. C.\r\n  §§824(a)(4), 822(a)(2). In determining consistency with the public in-\r\n  terest, he must consider five factors, including the State’s recommen-\r\n  dation, compliance with state, federal, and local law regarding con-\r\n  trolled substances, and “public health and safety.” §823(f). The CSA\r\n  explicitly contemplates a role for the States in regulating controlled\r\n  substances. See §903.\r\n     The Oregon Death With Dignity Act (ODWDA) exempts from civil\r\n2                        GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    or criminal liability state-licensed physicians who, in compliance with\r\n    ODWDA’s specific safeguards, dispense or prescribe a lethal dose of\r\n    drugs upon the request of a terminally ill patient. In 2001, the At-\r\n    torney General issued an Interpretive Rule to address the implemen-\r\n    tation and enforcement of the CSA with respect to ODWDA, declar-\r\n    ing that using controlled substances to assist suicide is not a\r\n    legitimate medical practice and that dispensing or prescribing them\r\n    for this purpose is unlawful under the CSA. The State, a physician, a\r\n    pharmacist, and some terminally ill state residents challenged the\r\n    Rule. The District Court permanently enjoined its enforcement. The\r\n    Ninth Circuit invalidated the Rule, reasoning that, by making a\r\n    medical procedure authorized under Oregon law a federal offense, it\r\n    altered the balance between the States and the Federal Government\r\n    without the requisite clear statement that the CSA authorized the\r\n    action; and in the alternative, that the Rule could not be squared\r\n    with the CSA’s plain language, which targets only conventional drug\r\n    abuse and excludes the Attorney General from medical policy deci-\r\n    sions.\r\nHeld: The CSA does not allow the Attorney General to prohibit doctors\r\n from prescribing regulated drugs for use in physician-assisted suicide\r\n under state law permitting the procedure. Pp. 8–28.\r\n    (a) An administrative rule interpreting the issuing agency’s own\r\n ambiguous regulation may receive substantial deference. Auer v.\r\n Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461–463. So may an interpretation of an am-\r\n biguous statute, Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\r\n Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842–845, but only “when it appears that\r\n Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules\r\n carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming\r\n deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority,” United\r\n States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226–227. Otherwise, the inter-\r\n pretation is “entitled to respect” only to the extent it has the “power\r\n to persuade.” Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140. Pp. 8–9.\r\n    (b) The Interpretive Rule at issue is not entitled to Auer deference\r\n as an interpretation of 21 CFR §1306.04. Unlike the underlying\r\n regulations in Auer, which gave specificity to a statutory scheme the\r\n Secretary of Labor was charged with enforcing and reflected the La-\r\n bor Department’s considerable experience and expertise, the underly-\r\n ing regulation here does little more than restate the terms of the\r\n statute itself. The CSA allows prescription of drugs that have a “cur-\r\n rently accepted medical use,” 21 U. S. C. §812(b); requires a “medical\r\n purpose” for dispensing the least controlled substances of those on\r\n the schedules, §829(c); and defines a “valid prescription” as one “is-\r\n sued for a legitimate medical purpose,” 21 U. S. C. A.\r\n §830(b)(3)(A)(ii). Similarly, physicians are considered practitioners if\r\n                   Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\nthey dispense controlled substances “in the course of professional\r\npractice.” 21 U. S. C. §802(21). The regulation just repeats two of\r\nthese statutory phrases and attempts to summarize the others. An\r\nagency does not acquire special authority to interpret its own words\r\nwhen, instead of using its expertise and experience to formulate a\r\nregulation, it has elected merely to paraphrase the statutory lan-\r\nguage. Furthermore, any statutory authority for the Interpretive\r\nRule would have to come from 1984 CSA amendments adding the\r\n“public interest” requirement, but 21 CFR §1306.04 was adopted in\r\n1971. That the current interpretation runs counter to the intent at\r\nthe time of the regulation’s promulgation is an additional reason why\r\nAuer deference is unwarranted. Pp. 9–11.\r\n   (c) The Interpretive Rule is also not entitled to Chevron deference.\r\nThe statutory phrase “legitimate medical purpose” is ambiguous in\r\nthe relevant sense. However, Chevron deference is not accorded\r\nmerely because the statute is ambiguous and an administrative offi-\r\ncial is involved. A rule must be promulgated pursuant to authority\r\nCongress has delegated to the official. The specific respects in which\r\nthe Attorney General is authorized to make rules under the CSA\r\nshow that he is not authorized to make a rule declaring illegitimate a\r\nmedical standard for patient care and treatment specifically author-\r\nized under state law. Congress delegated to the Attorney General\r\nonly the authority to promulgate rules relating to “registration” and\r\n“control” of the dispensing of controlled substances, 21 U. S. C. A.\r\n§821, and “for the efficient execution of his [statutory] functions,” 21\r\nU. S. C. §871(b). Control means “to add a . . . substance to a sched-\r\nule,” §802(5), following specified procedures. Because the Interpre-\r\ntive Rule does not concern scheduling of substances and was not is-\r\nsued under the required procedures, it cannot fall under the Attorney\r\nGeneral’s control authority. Even if “control” were understood to sig-\r\nnify something other than its statutory definition, it could not sup-\r\nport the Interpretive Rule. Nor can the Interpretive Rule be justified\r\nunder the CSA’s registration provisions. It does not undertake the\r\nAct’s five-factor analysis for determining when registration is “incon-\r\nsistent with the public interest,” §823(f), and it deals with much more\r\nthan registration. It purports to declare that using controlled sub-\r\nstances for physician-assisted suicide is a crime, an authority going\r\nwell beyond the Attorney General’s statutory power to register or de-\r\nregister physicians. It would be anomalous for Congress to have\r\npainstakingly described the Attorney General’s limited authority to\r\nderegister a single physician or schedule a single drug, but to have\r\ngiven him, just by implication, authority to declare an entire class of\r\nactivity outside the course of professional practice and therefore a\r\ncriminal violation of the CSA. It is not enough that “public interest,”\r\n4                         GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                                   Syllabus\r\n\r\n    “public health and safety,” and “Federal law” are used in the part of\r\n    the Act over which the Attorney General has authority. Cf. Sutton v.\r\n    United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U. S. 471. The first two terms do not call\r\n    on the Attorney General, or any Executive official, to make an inde-\r\n    pendent assessment of the meaning of federal law. The Attorney\r\n    General did not base the Interpretive Rule on an application of the\r\n    five-factor test generally, or the “public health and safety” factor spe-\r\n    cifically. Even if he had, it is doubtful that he could cite those factors\r\n    to deregister a physician simply because he deemed a controversial\r\n    practice permitted by state law to have an illegitimate medical pur-\r\n    pose. The federal-law factor requires the Attorney General to decide\r\n    “[c]ompliance” with the law but does not suggest that he may decide\r\n    what the law is. To say that he can define the substantive standards\r\n    of medical practice as part of his authority would also put 21 U. S. C.\r\n    §871(b) in considerable tension with the narrowly defined control and\r\n    registration delegation. It would go, moreover, against the plain lan-\r\n    guage of the text to treat a delegation for the “execution” of his func-\r\n    tions as a further delegation to define other functions well beyond the\r\n    Act’s specific grants of authority. The authority desired by the Gov-\r\n    ernment is inconsistent with the Act’s design in other fundamental\r\n    respects, e.g., the Attorney General must share power with, and in\r\n    some respect defer to, the Secretary, whose functions are likewise de-\r\n    lineated and confined by the Act. Postenactment congressional com-\r\n    mentary on the CSA’s regulation of medical practice is also at odds\r\n    with the Attorney General’s claimed authority. The Government’s\r\n    claim that the Attorney General’s decision is a legal, not medical, one\r\n    does not suffice, for the Interpretive Rule places extensive reliance on\r\n    medical judgments and views of the medical community in conclud-\r\n    ing that assisted suicide is not a legitimate medical purpose. The\r\n    idea that Congress gave him such broad and unusual authority\r\n    through an implicit delegation is not sustainable. The importance of\r\n    the issue of physician-assisted suicide makes the oblique form of the\r\n    claimed delegation all the more suspect. Pp. 11–22.\r\n       (d) The Attorney General’s opinion is unpersuasive under\r\n    Skidmore. The CSA and this Court’s case law amply support the\r\n    conclusion that Congress regulates medical practice insofar as it bars\r\n    doctors from using their prescription-writing powers as a means to\r\n    engage in illicit drug dealing and trafficking as conventionally under-\r\n    stood. Beyond this, the Act manifests no intent to regulate the prac-\r\n    tice of medicine generally, which is understandable given federal-\r\n    ism’s structure and limitations. The CSA’s structure and operation\r\n    presume and rely upon a functioning medical profession regulated\r\n    under the States’ police powers. The Federal Government can set\r\n    uniform standards for regulating health and safety. In connection\r\n                     Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                    5\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n  with the CSA, however, the only provision in which Congress set\r\n  general, uniform medical practice standards, 42 U. S. C. §2990bb2a,\r\n  strengthens the understanding of the CSA as a statute combating\r\n  recreational drug abuse, and also indicates that when Congress\r\n  wants to regulate medical practice in the given scheme, it does so by\r\n  explicit statutory language. The difficulty in defending the Attorney\r\n  General’s declaration that the CSA impliedly criminalizes physician-\r\n  assisted suicide is compounded by the Act’s consistent delegation of\r\n  medical judgments to the Secretary and its otherwise careful alloca-\r\n  tion of powers for enforcing the CSA’s limited objectives. The Gov-\r\n  ernment’s contention that the terms “medical” or “medicine” refer to\r\n  a healing or curative art, and thus cannot embrace the intentional\r\n  hastening of a patient’s death, rests on a reading of 21 U. S. C.\r\n  §829(a)’s prescription requirement without the illumination of the\r\n  rest of the statute. Viewed in context, that requirement is better un-\r\n  derstood as ensuring that patients use controlled substances under a\r\n  doctor’s supervision so as to prevent addiction and recreational\r\n  abuse. To read prescriptions for assisted suicide as “drug abuse” un-\r\n  der the CSA is discordant with the phrase’s consistent use through-\r\n  out the Act, not to mention its ordinary meaning. The Government’s\r\n  interpretation of the prescription requirement also fails under the ob-\r\n  jection that the Attorney General is an unlikely recipient of such\r\n  broad authority, given the Secretary’s primacy in shaping medical\r\n  policy under the CSA and the Act’s otherwise careful allocation of de-\r\n  cisionmaking powers.

GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\r\n      ET AL., PETITIONERS v. OREGON ET AL.\r\n\r\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\r\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\r\n                               [January 17, 2006]\r\n\r\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\r\n   The question before us is whether the Controlled Sub-\r\nstances Act allows the United States Attorney General to\r\nprohibit doctors from prescribing regulated drugs for use\r\nin physician-assisted suicide, notwithstanding a state law\r\npermitting the procedure. As the Court has observed,\r\n“Americans are engaged in an earnest and profound de-\r\nbate about the morality, legality, and practicality of physi-\r\ncian-assisted suicide.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521\r\nU. S. 702, 735 (1997). The dispute before us is in part a\r\nproduct of this political and moral debate, but its resolu-\r\ntion requires an inquiry familiar to the courts: interpret-\r\ning a federal statute to determine whether Executive\r\naction is authorized by, or otherwise consistent with, the\r\nenactment.\r\n   In 1994, Oregon became the first State to legalize as-\r\nsisted suicide when voters approved a ballot measure\r\nenacting the Oregon Death With Dignity Act (ODWDA).\r\nOre. Rev. Stat. §127.800 et seq. (2003). ODWDA, which\r\nsurvived a 1997 ballot measure seeking its repeal, ex-\r\nempts from civil or criminal liability state-licensed physi-\r\n2                   GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncians who, in compliance with the specific safeguards in\r\nODWDA, dispense or prescribe a lethal dose of drugs upon\r\nthe request of a terminally ill patient.\r\n   The drugs Oregon physicians prescribe under ODWDA\r\nare regulated under a federal statute, the Controlled\r\nSubstances Act (CSA or Act). 84 Stat. 1242, as amended,\r\n21 U. S. C. §801 et seq. The CSA allows these particular\r\ndrugs to be available only by a written prescription from a\r\nregistered physician. In the ordinary course the same\r\ndrugs are prescribed in smaller doses for pain alleviation.\r\n   A November 9, 2001 Interpretive Rule issued by the\r\nAttorney General addresses the implementation and\r\nenforcement of the CSA with respect to ODWDA. It de-\r\ntermines that using controlled substances to assist suicide\r\nis not a legitimate medical practice and that dispensing or\r\nprescribing them for this purpose is unlawful under the\r\nCSA. The Interpretive Rule’s validity under the CSA is\r\nthe issue before us.\r\n                                I\r\n                                A\r\n   We turn first to the text and structure of the CSA.\r\nEnacted in 1970 with the main objectives of combating\r\ndrug abuse and controlling the legitimate and illegitimate\r\ntraffic in controlled substances, the CSA creates a com-\r\nprehensive, closed regulatory regime criminalizing the\r\nunauthorized manufacture, distribution, dispensing, and\r\npossession of substances classified in any of the Act’s five\r\nschedules. Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. ____, ___ (2005)\r\n(slip op., at 9–10); 21 U. S. C. §841 (2000 ed. and Supp. II);\r\n21 U. S. C. §844. The Act places substances in one of five\r\nschedules based on their potential for abuse or depend-\r\nence, their accepted medical use, and their accepted safety\r\nfor use under medical supervision. Schedule I contains\r\nthe most severe restrictions on access and use, and Sched-\r\nule V the least. Raich, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11); 21\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U.

Congress classified a host of substances\r\nwhen it enacted the CSA, but the statute permits the\r\nAttorney General to add, remove, or reschedule sub-\r\nstances. He may do so, however, only after making par-\r\nticular findings, and on scientific and medical matters he\r\nis required to accept the findings of the Secretary of\r\nHealth and Human Services (Secretary). These proceed-\r\nings must be on the record after an opportunity for com-\r\nment. See 21 U. S. C. A. §811 (main ed. and Supp. 2005).\r\n   The present dispute involves controlled substances\r\nlisted in Schedule II, substances generally available only\r\npursuant to a written, nonrefillable prescription by a\r\nphysician. 21 U. S. C. §829(a). A 1971 regulation promul-\r\ngated by the Attorney General requires that every pre-\r\nscription for a controlled substance “be issued for a legiti-\r\nmate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting\r\nin the usual course of his professional practice.” 21 CFR\r\n§1306.04(a) (2005).\r\n   To prevent diversion of controlled substances with medi-\r\ncal uses, the CSA regulates the activity of physicians. To\r\nissue lawful prescriptions of Schedule II drugs, physicians\r\nmust “obtain from the Attorney General a registration\r\nissued in accordance with the rules and regulations prom-\r\nulgated by him.” 21 U. S. C. §822(a)(2). The Attorney\r\nGeneral may deny, suspend, or revoke this registration if,\r\nas relevant here, the physician’s registration would be\r\n“inconsistent with the public interest.”         §824(a)(4);\r\n§822(a)(2). When deciding whether a practitioner’s regis-\r\ntration is in the public interest, the Attorney General\r\n“shall” consider:\r\n       “(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State\r\n    licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.\r\n       “(2) The applicant’s experience in dispensing,\r\n    or conducting research with respect to controlled\r\n    substances.\r\n4                  GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n       “(3) The applicant’s conviction record under Federal\r\n    or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribu-\r\n    tion, or dispensing of controlled substances.\r\n       “(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or\r\n    local laws relating to controlled substances.\r\n       “(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the\r\n    public health and safety.” §823(f).\r\n  The CSA explicitly contemplates a role for the States in\r\nregulating controlled substances, as evidenced by its pre-\r\nemption provision.\r\n       “No provision of this subchapter shall be construed\r\n    as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to\r\n    occupy the field in which that provision operates . . .\r\n    to the exclusion of any State law on the same subject\r\n    matter which would otherwise be within the authority\r\n    of the State, unless there is a positive conflict between\r\n    that provision . . . and that State law so that the two\r\n    cannot consistently stand together.” §903.\r\n                              B\r\n  Oregon voters enacted ODWDA in 1994. For Oregon\r\nresidents to be eligible to request a prescription under\r\nODWDA, they must receive a diagnosis from their attend-\r\ning physician that they have an incurable and irreversible\r\ndisease that, within reasonable medical judgment, will\r\ncause death within six months. Ore. Rev. Stat. §§127.815,\r\n127.800(12) (2003). Attending physicians must also de-\r\ntermine whether a patient has made a voluntary request,\r\nensure a patient’s choice is informed, and refer patients to\r\ncounseling if they might be suffering from a psychological\r\ndisorder or depression causing impaired judgment.\r\n§§127.815, 127.825. A second “consulting” physician must\r\nexamine the patient and the medical record and confirm\r\nthe attending physician’s conclusions. §127.800(8).

Physicians who dispense\r\nmedication pursuant to ODWDA must also be registered\r\nwith both the State’s Board of Medical Examiners and the\r\nfederal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\r\n§127.815(1)(L). In 2004, 37 patients ended their lives by\r\ningesting a lethal dose of medication prescribed under\r\nODWDA. Oregon Dept. of Human Servs., Seventh Annual\r\nReport on Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act 20 (Mar. 10,\r\n2005).\r\n                             C\r\n   In 1997, Members of Congress concerned about ODWDA\r\ninvited the DEA to prosecute or revoke the CSA registra-\r\ntion of Oregon physicians who assist suicide. They con-\r\ntended that hastening a patient’s death is not legitimate\r\nmedical practice, so prescribing controlled substances for\r\nthat purpose violates the CSA. Letter from Sen. Orrin\r\nHatch and Rep. Henry Hyde to Thomas A. Constantine\r\n(July 25, 1997), reprinted in Hearings on S. 2151 before\r\nthe Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d\r\nSess., 2–3 (1999) (hereinafter Hearings). The letter re-\r\nceived an initial, favorable response from the director of\r\nthe DEA, see Letter from Thomas A. Constantine to Sen.\r\nOrrin Hatch (Nov. 5, 1997), Hearings 4–5, but Attorney\r\nGeneral Reno considered the matter and concluded that\r\nthe DEA could not take the proposed action because the\r\nCSA did not authorize it to “displace the states as the\r\nprimary regulators of the medical profession, or to over-\r\nride a state’s determination as to what constitutes legiti-\r\nmate medical practice,” Letter from Attorney General\r\nJanet Reno to Sen. Orrin Hatch, on Oregon’s Death with\r\n6                  GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nDignity Act (June 5, 1998), Hearings 5–6. Legislation was\r\nthen introduced to grant the explicit authority Attorney\r\nGeneral Reno found lacking; but it failed to pass. See\r\nH. R. 4006, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998); H. R. 2260, 106th\r\nCong., 1st Sess. (1999).\r\n   In 2001, John Ashcroft was appointed Attorney General.\r\nPerhaps because Mr. Ashcroft had supported efforts to\r\ncurtail assisted suicide while serving as a Senator, see,\r\ne.g., 143 Cong. Rec. 5589–5590 (1997) (remarks of Sen.\r\nAshcroft), Oregon Attorney General Hardy Myers wrote\r\nhim to request a meeting with Department of Justice\r\nofficials should the Department decide to revisit the appli-\r\ncation of the CSA to assisted suicide. Letter of Feb. 2,\r\n2001, App. to Brief for Patient-Respondents in Opposition\r\n55a. Attorney General Myers received a reply letter from\r\none of Attorney General Ashcroft’s advisers writing on his\r\nbehalf, which stated\r\n      “I am aware of no pending legislation in Congress\r\n    that would prompt a review of the Department’s in-\r\n    terpretation of the CSA as it relates to physician-\r\n    assisted suicide. Should such a review be commenced\r\n    in the future, we would be happy to include your\r\n    views in that review.” Letter from Lori Sharpe (Apr.\r\n    17, 2001), id., at 58a.\r\n  On November 9, 2001, without consulting Oregon or\r\napparently anyone outside his Department, the Attorney\r\nGeneral issued an Interpretive Rule announcing his intent\r\nto restrict the use of controlled substances for physician-\r\nassisted suicide. Incorporating the legal analysis of a\r\nmemorandum he had solicited from his Office of Legal\r\nCounsel, the Attorney General ruled\r\n    “assisting suicide is not a ‘legitimate medical purpose’\r\n    within the meaning of 21 CFR 1306.04 (2001), and\r\n    that prescribing, dispensing, or administering feder-\r\n    ally controlled substances to assist suicide violates the\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U.

Such conduct by a physi-\r\n    cian registered to dispense controlled substances may\r\n    ‘render his registration . . . inconsistent with the pub-\r\n    lic interest’ and therefore subject to possible suspen-\r\n    sion or revocation under 21 U. S. C. 824(a)(4). The At-\r\n    torney General’s conclusion applies regardless of\r\n    whether state law authorizes or permits such conduct\r\n    by practitioners or others and regardless of the condi-\r\n    tion of the person whose suicide is assisted.” 66 Fed.\r\n    Reg. 56608 (2001).\r\n   There is little dispute that the Interpretive Rule would\r\nsubstantially disrupt the ODWDA regime. Respondents\r\ncontend, and petitioners do not dispute, that every pre-\r\nscription filled under ODWDA has specified drugs classi-\r\nfied under Schedule II. A physician cannot prescribe the\r\nsubstances without DEA registration, and revocation or\r\nsuspension of the registration would be a severe restric-\r\ntion on medical practice. Dispensing controlled substances\r\nwithout a valid prescription, furthermore, is a federal\r\ncrime. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C. §841(a)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. II);\r\nUnited States v. Moore, 423 U. S. 122 (1975).\r\n   In response the State of Oregon, joined by a physician, a\r\npharmacist, and some terminally ill patients, all from\r\nOregon, challenged the Interpretive Rule in federal court.\r\nThe United States District Court for the District of Oregon\r\nentered a permanent injunction against the Interpretive\r\nRule’s enforcement.\r\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\r\nCircuit granted the petitions for review and held the In-\r\nterpretive Rule invalid. Oregon v. Ashcroft, 368 F. 3d 1118\r\n(2004). It reasoned that, by making a medical procedure\r\nauthorized under Oregon law a federal offense, the Inter-\r\npretive Rule altered the “ ‘ “usual constitutional balance\r\nbetween the States and the Federal Government” ’ ” with-\r\nout the requisite clear statement that the CSA authorized\r\n8                  GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nsuch action.    Id., at 1124–1125 (quoting Gregory v.\r\nAshcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991) (in turn quoting Atas-\r\ncadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242\r\n(1985))). The Court of Appeals held in the alternative that\r\nthe Interpretive Rule could not be squared with the plain\r\nlanguage of the CSA, which targets only conventional drug\r\nabuse and excludes the Attorney General from decisions\r\non medical policy. 368 F. 3d, at 1125–1129.\r\n  We granted the Government’s petition for certiorari.\r\n543 U. S. 1145 (2005).\r\n                               II\r\n   Executive actors often must interpret the enactments\r\nCongress has charged them with enforcing and imple-\r\nmenting. The parties before us are in sharp disagreement\r\nboth as to the degree of deference we must accord the\r\nInterpretive Rule’s substantive conclusions and whether\r\nthe Rule is authorized by the statutory text at all. Al-\r\nthough balancing the necessary respect for an agency’s\r\nknowledge, expertise, and constitutional office with the\r\ncourts’ role as interpreter of laws can be a delicate matter,\r\nfamiliar principles guide us. An administrative rule may\r\nreceive substantial deference if it interprets the issuing\r\nagency’s own ambiguous regulation. Auer v. Robbins, 519\r\nU. S. 452, 461–463 (1997). An interpretation of an am-\r\nbiguous statute may also receive substantial deference.\r\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun-\r\ncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842–845 (1984). Deference in\r\naccordance with Chevron, however, is warranted only\r\n“when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the\r\nagency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,\r\nand that the agency interpretation claiming deference was\r\npromulgated in the exercise of that authority.” United\r\nStates v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226–227 (2001).\r\nOtherwise, the interpretation is “entitled to respect” only\r\nto the extent it has the “power to persuade.” Skidmore v.\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nSwift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944).\r\n                             A\r\n   The Government first argues that the Interpretive Rule\r\nis an elaboration of one of the Attorney General’s own\r\nregulations, 21 CFR §1306.04 (2005), which requires all\r\nprescriptions be issued “for a legitimate medical purpose\r\nby an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of\r\nhis professional practice.” As such, the Government says,\r\nthe Interpretive Rule is entitled to considerable deference\r\nin accordance with Auer.\r\n   In our view Auer and the standard of deference it ac-\r\ncords to an agency are inapplicable here. Auer involved a\r\ndisputed interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of\r\n1938 as applied to a class of law enforcement officers.\r\nUnder regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor,\r\nan exemption from overtime pay depended, in part, on\r\nwhether the employees met the “salary basis” test. 519\r\nU. S., at 454–455. In this Court the Secretary of Labor\r\nfiled an amicus brief explaining why, in his view, the\r\nregulations gave exempt status to the officers. Id., at 461.\r\nWe gave weight to that interpretation, holding that be-\r\ncause the applicable test was “a creature of the Secretary’s\r\nown regulations, his interpretation of it is, under our\r\njurisprudence, controlling unless plainly erroneous or\r\ninconsistent with the regulation. ” Ibid. (internal quota-\r\ntion marks omitted).\r\n   In Auer, the underlying regulations gave specificity to a\r\nstatutory scheme the Secretary was charged with enforc-\r\ning and reflected the considerable experience and exper-\r\ntise the Department of Labor had acquired over time with\r\nrespect to the complexities of the Fair Labor Standards\r\nAct. Here, on the other hand, the underlying regulation\r\ndoes little more than restate the terms of the statute itself.\r\nThe language the Interpretive Rule addresses comes from\r\nCongress, not the Attorney General, and the near-\r\n10                 GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nequivalence of the statute and regulation belies the Gov-\r\nernment’s argument for Auer deference.\r\n   The Government does not suggest that its interpretation\r\nturns on any difference between the statutory and regula-\r\ntory language. The CSA allows prescription of drugs only\r\nif they have a “currently accepted medical use,” 21 U. S. C.\r\n§812(b); requires a “medical purpose” for dispensing the\r\nleast controlled substances of those on the schedules,\r\n§829(c); and, in its reporting provision, defines a “valid\r\nprescription” as one “issued for a legitimate medical pur-\r\npose,” §830(b)(3)(A)(ii). Similarly, physicians are consid-\r\nered to be acting as practitioners under the statute if they\r\ndispense controlled substances “in the course of profes-\r\nsional practice.” §802(21). The regulation uses the terms\r\n“legitimate medical purpose” and “the course of profes-\r\nsional practice,” ibid., but this just repeats two statutory\r\nphrases and attempts to summarize the others. It gives\r\nlittle or no instruction on a central issue in this case: Who\r\ndecides whether a particular activity is in “the course of\r\nprofessional practice” or done for a “legitimate medical\r\npurpose”? Since the regulation gives no indication how to\r\ndecide this issue, the Attorney General’s effort to decide it\r\nnow cannot be considered an interpretation of the regula-\r\ntion. Simply put, the existence of a parroting regulation\r\ndoes not change the fact that the question here is not the\r\nmeaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute.\r\nAn agency does not acquire special authority to interpret\r\nits own words when, instead of using its expertise and\r\nexperience to formulate a regulation, it has elected merely\r\nto paraphrase the statutory language.\r\n   Furthermore, as explained below, if there is statutory\r\nauthority to issue the Interpretive Rule it comes from the\r\n1984 amendments to the CSA that gave the Attorney\r\nGeneral authority to register and deregister physicians\r\nbased on the public interest. The regulation was enacted\r\nbefore those amendments, so the Interpretive Rule cannot\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            11\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nbe justified as indicative of some intent the Attorney\r\nGeneral had in 1971. That the current interpretation runs\r\ncounter to the “intent at the time of the regulation’s prom-\r\nulgation,” is an additional reason why Auer deference is\r\nunwarranted. Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512\r\nU. S. 504, 512 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nDeference under Auer being inappropriate, we turn to the\r\nquestion whether the Interpretive Rule, on its own terms,\r\nis a permissible interpretation of the CSA.\r\n                              B\r\n   Just as the Interpretive Rule receives no deference\r\nunder Auer, neither does it receive deference under Chev-\r\nron. If a statute is ambiguous, judicial review of adminis-\r\ntrative rulemaking often demands Chevron deference; and\r\nthe rule is judged accordingly. All would agree, we should\r\nthink, that the statutory phrase “legitimate medical pur-\r\npose” is a generality, susceptible to more precise definition\r\nand open to varying constructions, and thus ambiguous in\r\nthe relevant sense. Chevron deference, however, is not\r\naccorded merely because the statute is ambiguous and an\r\nadministrative official is involved. To begin with, the rule\r\nmust be promulgated pursuant to authority Congress has\r\ndelegated to the official. Mead, 533 U. S., at 226–227.\r\n   The Attorney General has rulemaking power to fulfill\r\nhis duties under the CSA. The specific respects in which\r\nhe is authorized to make rules, however, instruct us that\r\nhe is not authorized to make a rule declaring illegitimate a\r\nmedical standard for care and treatment of patients that\r\nis specifically authorized under state law.\r\n   The starting point for this inquiry is, of course, the\r\nlanguage of the delegation provision itself. In many cases\r\nauthority is clear because the statute gives an agency\r\nbroad power to enforce all provisions of the statute. See,\r\ne.g., National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand\r\nX Internet Services, 545 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 8)\r\n12                 GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n(explaining that a Federal Communications Commission\r\nregulation received Chevron deference because “Congress\r\nhas delegated to the Commission the authority to . . .\r\n‘prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary\r\nin the public interest to carry out the provisions’ of the\r\nAct” (quoting 47 U. S. C. §201(b))); Household Credit\r\nServices, Inc. v. Pfennig, 541 U. S. 232, 238 (2004) (giving\r\nChevron deference to a Federal Reserve Board regulation\r\nwhere “Congress has expressly delegated to the Board the\r\nauthority to prescribe regulations . . . as, in the judgment\r\nof the Board, ‘are necessary or proper to effectuate the\r\npurposes of’ ” the statute (quoting 15 U. S. C. §1604(a))).\r\nThe CSA does not grant the Attorney General this broad\r\nauthority to promulgate rules.\r\n  The CSA gives the Attorney General limited powers, to\r\nbe exercised in specific ways. His rulemaking authority\r\nunder the CSA is described in two provisions: (1) “The\r\nAttorney General is authorized to promulgate rules and\r\nregulations and to charge reasonable fees relating to the\r\nregistration and control of the manufacture, distribution,\r\nand dispensing of controlled substances and to listed\r\nchemicals,” 21 U. S. C. A. §821 (Supp. 2005); and (2) “The\r\nAttorney General may promulgate and enforce any rules,\r\nregulations, and procedures which he may deem necessary\r\nand appropriate for the efficient execution of his functions\r\nunder this subchapter,” 21 U. S. C. §871(b). As is evident\r\nfrom these sections, Congress did not delegate to the\r\nAttorney General authority to carry out or effect all provi-\r\nsions of the CSA. Rather, he can promulgate rules relat-\r\ning only to “registration” and “control,” and “for the effi-\r\ncient execution of his functions” under the statute.\r\n  Turning first to the Attorney General’s authority to\r\nmake regulations for the “control” of drugs, this delegation\r\ncannot sustain the Interpretive Rule’s attempt to define\r\nstandards of medical practice. Control is a term of art in\r\nthe CSA. “As used in this subchapter,” §802––the sub-\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)           13\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nchapter that includes §821––\r\n    “The term ‘control’ means to add a drug or other sub-\r\n    stance, or immediate precursor, to a schedule under\r\n    part B of this subchapter, whether by transfer from\r\n    another schedule or otherwise.” §802(5).\r\nTo exercise his scheduling power, the Attorney General\r\nmust follow a detailed set of procedures, including re-\r\nquesting a scientific and medical evaluation from the\r\nSecretary. See 21 U. S. C. A. §§811, 812 (main ed. and\r\nSupp. 2005). The statute is also specific as to the manner\r\nin which the Attorney General must exercise this author-\r\nity: “Rules of the Attorney General under this subsection\r\n[regarding scheduling] shall be made on the record after\r\nopportunity for a hearing pursuant to the rulemaking\r\nprocedures prescribed by [the Administrative Procedure\r\nAct, 5 U. S. C. §553].” 21 U. S. C. §811(a). The Interpre-\r\ntive Rule now under consideration does not concern the\r\nscheduling of substances and was not issued after\r\nthe required procedures for rules regarding scheduling, so\r\nit cannot fall under the Attorney General’s “control”\r\nauthority.\r\n   Even if “control” in §821 were understood to signify\r\nsomething other than its statutory definition, it would not\r\nsupport the Interpretive Rule. The statutory references to\r\n“control” outside the scheduling context make clear that\r\nthe Attorney General can establish controls “against\r\ndiversion,” e.g., §823(a)(1), but do not give him authority to\r\ndefine diversion based on his view of legitimate medical\r\npractice. As explained below, the CSA’s express limita-\r\ntions on the Attorney General’s authority, and other indi-\r\ncations from the statutory scheme, belie any notion that\r\nthe Attorney General has been granted this implicit au-\r\nthority. Indeed, if “control” were given the expansive\r\nmeaning required to sustain the Interpretive Rule, it\r\nwould transform the carefully described limits on the\r\n14                  GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nAttorney General’s authority over registration and sched-\r\nuling into mere suggestions.\r\n   We turn, next, to the registration provisions of the CSA.\r\nBefore 1984, the Attorney General was required to regis-\r\nter any physician who was authorized by his State. The\r\nAttorney General could only deregister a physician who\r\nfalsified his application, was convicted of a felony relating\r\nto controlled substances, or had his state license or regis-\r\ntration revoked. See 84 Stat. 1255. The CSA was\r\namended in 1984 to allow the Attorney General to deny\r\nregistration to an applicant “if he determines that the\r\nissuance of such registration would be inconsistent with\r\nthe public interest.” 21 U. S. C. §823(f). Registration may\r\nalso be revoked or suspended by the Attorney General on\r\nthe same grounds. §824(a)(4). In determining consistency\r\nwith the public interest, the Attorney General must, as\r\ndiscussed above, consider five factors, including: the\r\nState’s recommendation; compliance with state, federal,\r\nand local laws regarding controlled substances; and public\r\nhealth and safety. §823(f).\r\n   The Interpretive Rule cannot be justified under this part\r\nof the statute. It does not undertake the five-factor analy-\r\nsis and concerns much more than registration. Nor does\r\nthe Interpretive Rule on its face purport to be an applica-\r\ntion of the registration provision in §823(f). It is, instead,\r\nan interpretation of the substantive federal law require-\r\nments (under 21 CFR §1306.04 (2005)) for a valid pre-\r\nscription. It begins by announcing that assisting suicide is\r\nnot a “legitimate medical purpose” under §1306.04, and\r\nthat dispensing controlled substances to assist a suicide\r\nviolates the CSA. 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (2001). Violation is\r\na criminal offense, and often a felony, under 21 U. S. C.\r\n§841 (2000 ed. and Supp. II). The Interpretive Rule thus\r\npurports to declare that using controlled substances for\r\nphysician-assisted suicide is a crime, an authority that\r\ngoes well beyond the Attorney General’s statutory power\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nto register or deregister.\r\n   The Attorney General’s deregistration power, of course,\r\nmay carry implications for criminal enforcement because if\r\na physician dispenses a controlled substance after he is\r\nderegistered, he violates §841. The Interpretive Rule\r\nworks in the opposite direction, however: it declares cer-\r\ntain conduct criminal, placing in jeopardy the registration\r\nof any physician who engages in that conduct. To the\r\nextent the Interpretive Rule concerns registration, it\r\nsimply states the obvious because one of the five factors\r\nthe Attorney General must consider in deciding the “public\r\ninterest” is “[c]ompliance with applicable State, Federal,\r\nor local laws relating to controlled substances.” 21 U. S. C.\r\n§823(f)(4). The problem with the design of the Interpre-\r\ntive Rule is that it cannot, and does not, explain why the\r\nAttorney General has the authority to decide what consti-\r\ntutes an underlying violation of the CSA in the first place.\r\nThe explanation the Government seems to advance is that\r\nthe Attorney General’s authority to decide whether a\r\nphysician’s actions are inconsistent with the “public inter-\r\nest” provides the basis for the Interpretive Rule.\r\n   By this logic, however, the Attorney General claims\r\nextraordinary authority. If the Attorney General’s argu-\r\nment were correct, his power to deregister necessarily\r\nwould include the greater power to criminalize even the\r\nactions of registered physicians, whenever they engage in\r\nconduct he deems illegitimate. This power to criminal-\r\nize—unlike his power over registration, which must be\r\nexercised only after considering five express statutory\r\nfactors—would be unrestrained. It would be anomalous\r\nfor Congress to have so painstakingly described the Attor-\r\nney General’s limited authority to deregister a single\r\nphysician or schedule a single drug, but to have given him,\r\njust by implication, authority to declare an entire class of\r\nactivity outside “the course of professional practice,” and\r\ntherefore a criminal violation of the CSA. See Federal\r\n16                  GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nMaritime Comm’n v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 411 U. S. 726,\r\n744 (1973) (“In light of these specific grants of . . . author-\r\nity, we are unwilling to construe the ambiguous provisions\r\n. . . to serve this purpose [of creating further authority]—a\r\npurpose for which it obviously was not intended”).\r\n   Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U. S. 471 (1999), is\r\ninstructive. The statute at issue was the Americans with\r\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which, like the CSA, di-\r\nvides interpretive authority among various Executive\r\nactors. The Court relied on “the terms and structure of\r\nthe ADA” to decide that neither the Equal Employment\r\nOpportunity Commission, nor any other agency had au-\r\nthority to define “disability” in the ADA. Id., at 479.\r\nSpecifically, the delegating provision stated that the\r\nEEOC “shall issue regulations . . . to carry out this sub-\r\nchapter,” 42 U. S. C. §12116, and the section of the statute\r\ndefining “disability” was in a different subchapter. The\r\nCourt did not accept the idea that because “the employ-\r\nment subchapter, i.e., ‘this subchapter,’ includes other\r\nprovisions that use the defined terms, . . . [t]he EEOC\r\nmight elaborate, through regulations, on the meaning of\r\n‘disability’ . . . if elaboration is needed in order to ‘carry\r\nout’ the substantive provisions of ‘this subchapter.’ ” 527\r\nU. S., at 514 (BREYER, J., dissenting). See also Adams\r\nFruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U. S. 638, 649–650 (1990) (hold-\r\ning that a delegation of authority to promulgate motor\r\nvehicle safety “standards” did not include the authority to\r\ndecide the pre-emptive scope of the federal statute because\r\n“[n]o such delegation regarding [the statute’s] enforcement\r\nprovisions is evident in the statute”).\r\n   The same principle controls here. It is not enough that\r\nthe terms “public interest,” “public health and safety,” and\r\n“Federal law” are used in the part of the statute over\r\nwhich the Attorney General has authority. The statutory\r\nterms “public interest” and “public health” do not call on\r\nthe Attorney General, or any other Executive official, to\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)           17\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmake an independent assessment of the meaning of fed-\r\neral law. The Attorney General did not base the Interpre-\r\ntive Rule on an application of the five-factor test generally,\r\nor the “public health and safety” factor specifically. Even\r\nif he had, it is doubtful the Attorney General could cite the\r\n“public interest” or “public health” to deregister a physi-\r\ncian simply because he deemed a controversial practice\r\npermitted by state law to have an illegitimate medical\r\npurpose.\r\n   As for the federal law factor, though it does require the\r\nAttorney General to decide “[c]ompliance” with the law, it\r\ndoes not suggest that he may decide what the law says.\r\nWere it otherwise, the Attorney General could authorita-\r\ntively interpret “State” and “local laws,” which are also\r\nincluded in 21 U. S. C. §823(f), despite the obvious consti-\r\ntutional problems in his doing so. Just as he must evalu-\r\nate compliance with federal law in deciding about registra-\r\ntion, the Attorney General must as surely evaluate\r\ncompliance with federal law in deciding whether to prose-\r\ncute; but this does not entitle him to Chevron deference.\r\nSee Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 177 (1990)\r\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (“The Justice De-\r\npartment, of course, has a very specific responsibility to\r\ndetermine for itself what this statute means, in order to\r\ndecide when to prosecute; but we have never thought that\r\nthe interpretation of those charged with prosecuting\r\ncriminal statutes is entitled to deference”).\r\n   The limits on the Attorney General’s authority to define\r\nmedical standards for the care and treatment of patients\r\nbear also on the proper interpretation of §871(b). This\r\nsection allows the Attorney General to best determine how\r\nto execute “his functions.” It is quite a different matter,\r\nhowever, to say that the Attorney General can define the\r\nsubstantive standards of medical practice as part of his\r\nauthority. To find a delegation of this extent in §871\r\nwould put that part of the statute in considerable tension\r\n18                  GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nwith the narrowly defined delegation concerning control\r\nand registration. It would go, moreover, against the plain\r\nlanguage of the text to treat a delegation for the “execu-\r\ntion” of his functions as a further delegation to define\r\nother functions well beyond the statute’s specific grants of\r\nauthority. When Congress chooses to delegate a power of\r\nthis extent, it does so not by referring back to the adminis-\r\ntrator’s functions but by giving authority over the provi-\r\nsions of the statute he is to interpret. See, e.g., National\r\nCable & Telecommunications Assn., 545 U. S. ___; House-\r\nhold Credit Services, 541 U. S. 232.\r\n   The authority desired by the Government is inconsistent\r\nwith the design of the statute in other fundamental re-\r\nspects. The Attorney General does not have the sole dele-\r\ngated authority under the CSA. He must instead share it\r\nwith, and in some respects defer to, the Secretary, whose\r\nfunctions are likewise delineated and confined by the\r\nstatute. The CSA allocates decisionmaking powers among\r\nstatutory actors so that medical judgments, if they are to\r\nbe decided at the federal level and for the limited objects of\r\nthe statute, are placed in the hands of the Secretary. In\r\nthe scheduling context, for example, the Secretary’s rec-\r\nommendations on scientific and medical matters bind the\r\nAttorney General. The Attorney General cannot control a\r\nsubstance if the Secretary disagrees. 21 U. S. C. §811(b).\r\nSee H. R. Rep. No. 91–1444, pt. 1, p. 33 (1970) (the section\r\n“is not intended to authorize the Attorney General to\r\nundertake or support medical and scientific research [for\r\nthe purpose of scheduling], which is within the competence\r\nof the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare”).\r\n   In a similar vein the 1970 Act’s regulation of medical\r\npractice with respect to drug rehabilitation gives the\r\nAttorney General a limited role; for it is the Secretary\r\nwho, after consultation with the Attorney General and\r\nnational medical groups, “determine[s] the appropriate\r\nmethods of professional practice in the medical treatment\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)          19\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nof . . . narcotic addiction.” 42 U. S. C. §290bb–2a; see 21\r\nU. S. C. §823(g) (2000 ed. and Supp. II) (stating that the\r\nAttorney General shall register practitioners who dispense\r\ndrugs for narcotics treatment when the Secretary has\r\ndetermined the applicant is qualified to treat addicts and\r\nthe Attorney General has concluded the applicant will\r\ncomply with record keeping and security regulations);\r\nMoore, 423 U. S., at 144 (noting that in enacting the addic-\r\ntion-treatment provisions, Congress sought to change the\r\nfact “that ‘criminal prosecutions’ in the past had turned on\r\nthe opinions of federal prosecutors”); H. R. Rep. No. 93–\r\n884, p. 6 (1974) (“This section preserves the distinctions\r\nfound in the [CSA] between the functions of the Attorney\r\nGeneral and the Secretary . . . . All decisions of a medical\r\nnature are to be made by the Secretary . . . . Law en-\r\nforcement decisions respecting the security of stocks of\r\nnarcotics drugs and the maintenance of records on such\r\ndrugs are to be made by the Attorney General”).\r\n   Post enactment congressional commentary on the CSA’s\r\nregulation of medical practice is also at odds with the\r\nAttorney General’s claimed authority to determine appro-\r\npriate medical standards. In 1978, in preparation for\r\nratification of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances,\r\nFeb. 21, 1971, [1979–1980] 32 U. S. T. 543, T. I. A. S. No.\r\n9725, Congress decided it would implement the United\r\nStates’ compliance through “the framework of the proce-\r\ndures and criteria for classification of substances provided\r\nin the” CSA. 21 U. S. C. §801a(3). It did so to ensure that\r\n“nothing in the Convention will interfere with ethical\r\nmedical practice in this country as determined by [the\r\nSecretary] on the basis of a consensus of the views of the\r\nAmerican medical and scientific community.” Ibid.\r\n   The structure of the CSA, then, conveys unwillingness\r\nto cede medical judgments to an Executive official who\r\nlacks medical expertise. In interpreting statutes that\r\ndivide authority, the Court has recognized: “Because\r\n20                 GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nhistorical familiarity and policymaking expertise account\r\nin the first instance for the presumption that Congress\r\ndelegates interpretive lawmaking power to the agency\r\nrather than to the reviewing court, we presume here that\r\nCongress intended to invest interpretive power in the\r\nadministrative actor in the best position to develop these\r\nattributes.” Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health\r\nReview Comm’n, 499 U. S. 144, 153 (1991) (citations omit-\r\nted). This presumption works against a conclusion that\r\nthe Attorney General has authority to make quintessen-\r\ntially medical judgments.\r\n   The Government contends the Attorney General’s deci-\r\nsion here is a legal, not a medical, one. This generality,\r\nhowever, does not suffice. The Attorney General’s Inter-\r\npretive Rule, and the Office of Legal Counsel memo it\r\nincorporates, place extensive reliance on medical judg-\r\nments and the views of the medical community in conclud-\r\ning that assisted suicide is not a “legitimate medical pur-\r\npose.” See 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (noting the “medical”\r\ndistinctions between assisting suicide and giving sufficient\r\nmedication to alleviate pain); Memorandum from Office of\r\nLegal Counsel to Attorney General (June 27, 2001), App.\r\nto Pet. for Cert. 121a–122a, and n. 17 (discussing the\r\n“Federal medical policy” against physician-assisted sui-\r\ncide), id., at 124a–130a (examining views of the medical\r\ncommunity). This confirms that the authority claimed by\r\nthe Attorney General is both beyond his expertise and\r\nincongruous with the statutory purposes and design.\r\n   The idea that Congress gave the Attorney General such\r\nbroad and unusual authority through an implicit delega-\r\ntion in the CSA’s registration provision is not sustainable.\r\n“Congress, we have held, does not alter the fundamental\r\ndetails of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary\r\nprovisions—it does not, one might say, hide elephants in\r\nmouseholes.” Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,\r\n531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001); see FDA v. Brown & Williamson\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nTobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 160 (2000) (“[W]e are confi-\r\ndent that Congress could not have intended to delegate a\r\ndecision of such economic and political significance to an\r\nagency in so cryptic a fashion”).\r\n   The importance of the issue of physician-assisted sui-\r\ncide, which has been the subject of an “earnest and pro-\r\nfound debate” across the country, Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at\r\n735, makes the oblique form of the claimed delegation all\r\nthe more suspect. Under the Government’s theory, more-\r\nover, the medical judgments the Attorney General could\r\nmake are not limited to physician-assisted suicide. Were\r\nthis argument accepted, he could decide whether any\r\nparticular drug may be used for any particular purpose, or\r\nindeed whether a physician who administers any contro-\r\nversial treatment could be deregistered. This would occur,\r\nunder the Government’s view, despite the statute’s ex-\r\npress limitation of the Attorney General’s authority to\r\nregistration and control, with attendant restrictions on\r\neach of those functions, and despite the statutory purposes\r\nto combat drug abuse and prevent illicit drug trafficking.\r\n   We need not decide whether Chevron deference would be\r\nwarranted for an interpretation issued by the Attorney\r\nGeneral concerning matters closer to his role under the\r\nCSA, namely preventing doctors from engaging in illicit\r\ndrug trafficking. In light of the foregoing, however, the\r\nCSA does not give the Attorney General authority to issue\r\nthe Interpretive Rule as a statement with the force of law.\r\n   If, in the course of exercising his authority, the Attorney\r\nGeneral uses his analysis in the Interpretive Rule only for\r\nguidance in deciding when to prosecute or deregister, then\r\nthe question remains whether his substantive interpreta-\r\ntion is correct. Since the Interpretive Rule was not prom-\r\nulgated pursuant to the Attorney General’s authority, its\r\ninterpretation of “legitimate medical purpose” does not\r\nreceive Chevron deference. Instead, it receives deference\r\nonly in accordance with Skidmore. “The weight of such a\r\n22                 GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\njudgment in a particular case will depend upon the thor-\r\noughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its\r\nreasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pro-\r\nnouncements, and all those factors which give it power to\r\npersuade, if lacking power to control.” 323 U. S., at 140;\r\nsee also Mead, 533 U. S., at 235 (noting that an opinion\r\nreceiving Skidmore deference may “claim the merit of its\r\nwriter’s thoroughness, logic, and expertness, its fit with\r\nprior interpretations, and any other sources of weight”).\r\nThe deference here is tempered by the Attorney General’s\r\nlack of expertise in this area and the apparent absence of\r\nany consultation with anyone outside the Department of\r\nJustice who might aid in a reasoned judgment. In any\r\nevent, under Skidmore, we follow an agency’s rule only to\r\nthe extent it is persuasive, see Christensen v. Harris\r\nCounty, 529 U. S. 576, 587 (2000); and for the reasons given\r\nand for further reasons set out below, we do not find the\r\nAttorney General’s opinion persuasive.\r\n                             III\r\n  As we have noted before, the CSA “repealed most of the\r\nearlier antidrug laws in favor of a comprehensive regime\r\nto combat the international and interstate traffic in illicit\r\ndrugs.” Raich, 545 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). In doing\r\nso, Congress sought to “conquer drug abuse and to control\r\nthe legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled sub-\r\nstances.” Ibid. It comes as little surprise, then, that we\r\nhave not considered the extent to which the CSA regulates\r\nmedical practice beyond prohibiting a doctor from acting\r\nas a drug “ ‘pusher’ ” instead of a physician. Moore, 423\r\nU. S., at 143. In Moore, we addressed a situation in which\r\na doctor “sold drugs, not for legitimate purposes, but\r\nprimarily for the profits to be derived therefrom.” Id., at\r\n135 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 91–1444, pt. 1, at 10; internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). There the defendant, who had\r\nengaged in large-scale overprescribing of methadone,\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)           23\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n“concede[d] in his brief that he did not observe generally\r\naccepted medical practices.” 423 U. S., at 126. And in\r\nUnited States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Cooperative,\r\n532 U. S. 483 (2001), Congress’ express determination that\r\nmarijuana had no accepted medical use foreclosed any\r\nargument about statutory coverage of drugs available by a\r\ndoctor’s prescription.\r\n   In deciding whether the CSA can be read as prohibiting\r\nphysician-assisted suicide, we look to the statute’s text\r\nand design. The statute and our case law amply support\r\nthe conclusion that Congress regulates medical practice\r\ninsofar as it bars doctors from using their prescription-\r\nwriting powers as a means to engage in illicit drug dealing\r\nand trafficking as conventionally understood. Beyond\r\nthis, however, the statute manifests no intent to regulate\r\nthe practice of medicine generally. The silence is under-\r\nstandable given the structure and limitations of federal-\r\nism, which allow the States “ ‘great latitude under their\r\npolice powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives,\r\nlimbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.’ ” Med-\r\ntronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 475 (1996) (quoting Met-\r\nropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 756\r\n(1985)).\r\n   The structure and operation of the CSA presume and\r\nrely upon a functioning medical profession regulated\r\nunder the States’ police powers. The Attorney General\r\ncan register a physician to dispense controlled substances\r\n“if the applicant is authorized to dispense . . . controlled\r\nsubstances under the laws of the State in which he prac-\r\ntices.” 21 U. S. C. §823(f). When considering whether to\r\nrevoke a physician’s registration, the Attorney General\r\nlooks not just to violations of federal drug laws; but he\r\n“shall” also consider “[t]he recommendation of the appro-\r\npriate state licensing board or professional disciplinary\r\nauthority” and the registrant’s compliance with state and\r\nlocal drug laws. Ibid. The very definition of a “practitio-\r\n24                 GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nner” eligible to prescribe includes physicians “licensed,\r\nregistered, or otherwise permitted, by the United States or\r\nthe jurisdiction in which he practices” to dispense con-\r\ntrolled substances. §802(21). Further cautioning against\r\nthe conclusion that the CSA effectively displaces the\r\nStates’ general regulation of medical practice is the Act’s\r\npre-emption provision, which indicates that, absent a\r\npositive conflict, none of the Act’s provisions should be\r\n“construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Con-\r\ngress to occupy the field in which that provision operates\r\n. . . to the exclusion of any State law on the same subject\r\nmatter which would otherwise be within the authority of\r\nthe State.” §903.\r\n    Oregon’s regime is an example of the state regulation of\r\nmedical practice that the CSA presupposes. Rather than\r\nsimply decriminalizing assisted suicide, ODWDA limits its\r\nexercise to the attending physicians of terminally ill pa-\r\ntients, physicians who must be licensed by Oregon’s Board\r\nof Medical Examiners.          Ore. Rev. Stat. §§127.815,\r\n127.800(10) (2003). The statute gives attending physi-\r\ncians a central role, requiring them to provide prognoses\r\nand prescriptions, give information about palliative alter-\r\nnatives and counseling, and ensure patients are competent\r\nand acting voluntarily. §127.815. Any eligible patient\r\nmust also get a second opinion from another registered\r\nphysician, §127.820, and the statute’s safeguards require\r\nphysicians to keep and submit to inspection detailed re-\r\ncords of their actions, §§127.855, 127.865.\r\n    Even though regulation of health and safety is “primar-\r\nily, and historically, a matter of local concern,” Hillsbor-\r\nough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471\r\nU. S. 707, 719 (1985), there is no question that the Federal\r\nGovernment can set uniform national standards in these\r\nareas. See Raich, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6). In connec-\r\ntion to the CSA, however, we find only one area in which\r\nCongress set general, uniform standards of medical prac-\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)           25\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntice. Title I of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention\r\nand Control Act of 1970, of which the CSA was Title II,\r\nprovides that\r\n    “[The Secretary], after consultation with the Attorney\r\n    General and with national organizations representa-\r\n    tive of persons with knowledge and experience in the\r\n    treatment of narcotic addicts, shall determine the ap-\r\n    propriate methods of professional practice in the\r\n    medical treatment of the narcotic addiction of various\r\n    classes of narcotic addicts, and shall report thereon\r\n    from time to time to the Congress.” §4, 84 Stat. 1241,\r\n    codified at 42 U. S. C. §290bb–2a.\r\nThis provision strengthens the understanding of the CSA\r\nas a statute combating recreational drug abuse, and also\r\nindicates that when Congress wants to regulate medical\r\npractice in the given scheme, it does so by explicit lan-\r\nguage in the statute.\r\n  In the face of the CSA’s silence on the practice of medi-\r\ncine generally and its recognition of state regulation of the\r\nmedical profession it is difficult to defend the Attorney\r\nGeneral’s declaration that the statute impliedly criminal-\r\nizes physician-assisted suicide. This difficulty is com-\r\npounded by the CSA’s consistent delegation of medical\r\njudgments to the Secretary and its otherwise careful\r\nallocation of powers for enforcing the limited objects of the\r\nCSA. See Part II–B, supra. The Government’s attempt to\r\nmeet this challenge rests, for the most part, on the CSA’s\r\nrequirement that every Schedule II drug be dispensed\r\npursuant to a “written prescription of a practitioner.” 21\r\nU. S. C. §829(a). A prescription, the Government argues,\r\nnecessarily implies that the substance is being made\r\navailable to a patient for a legitimate medical purpose.\r\nThe statute, in this view, requires an anterior judgment\r\nabout the term “medical” or “medicine.” The Government\r\ncontends ordinary usage of these words ineluctably refers\r\n26                  GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nto a healing or curative art, which by these terms cannot\r\nembrace the intentional hastening of a patient’s death. It\r\nalso points to the teachings of Hippocrates, the positions of\r\nprominent medical organizations, the Federal Government,\r\nand the judgment of the 49 States that have not legalized\r\nphysician-assisted suicide as further support for the propo-\r\nsition that the practice is not legitimate medicine. See Brief\r\nfor Petitioners 22–24; Memorandum from Office of Legal\r\nCounsel to Attorney General, App. to Pet. for Cert. 124a–\r\n130a.\r\n   On its own, this understanding of medicine’s boundaries\r\nis at least reasonable. The primary problem with the\r\nGovernment’s argument, however, is its assumption that\r\nthe CSA impliedly authorizes an Executive officer to bar a\r\nuse simply because it may be inconsistent with one rea-\r\nsonable understanding of medical practice. Viewed alone,\r\nthe prescription requirement may support such an under-\r\nstanding, but statutes “should not be read as a series of\r\nunrelated and isolated provisions.” Gustafson v. Alloyd\r\nCo., 513 U. S. 561, 570 (1995). The CSA’s substantive\r\nprovisions and their arrangement undermine this as-\r\nsertion of an expansive federal authority to regulate\r\nmedicine.\r\n   The statutory criteria for deciding what substances are\r\ncontrolled, determinations which are central to the Act,\r\nconsistently connect the undefined term “drug abuse” with\r\naddiction or abnormal effects on the nervous system.\r\nWhen the Attorney General schedules drugs, he must\r\nconsider a substance’s psychic or physiological dependence\r\nliability. 21 U. S. C. §811(c)(7). To classify a substance in\r\nSchedules II through V, the Attorney General must find\r\nabuse of the drug leads to psychological or physical de-\r\npendence. §812(b). Indeed, the differentiation of Sched-\r\nules II through V turns in large part on a substance’s\r\nhabit-forming potential: The more addictive a substance,\r\nthe stricter the controls. Ibid.

See\r\n§1902(a) of the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990, 104\r\nStat. 4851 (placing anabolic steroids in Schedule III).\r\n   The statutory scheme with which the CSA is inter-\r\ntwined further confirms a more limited understanding of\r\nthe prescription requirement. When the Secretary consid-\r\ners FDA approval of a substance with “stimulant, depres-\r\nsant, or hallucinogenic effect,” he must forward the infor-\r\nmation to the Attorney General for possible scheduling.\r\nShedding light on Congress’ understanding of drug abuse,\r\nthis requirement appears under the heading “Abuse po-\r\ntential.” 21 U. S. C. §811(f). Similarly, when Congress\r\nprepared to implement the Convention on Psychotropic\r\nSubstances, it did so through the CSA. §801a.\r\n   The Interpretive Rule rests on a reading of the prescrip-\r\ntion requirement that is persuasive only to the extent one\r\nscrutinizes the provision without the illumination of the\r\nrest of the statute. See Massachusetts v. Morash, 490\r\nU. S. 107, 114–115 (1989). Viewed in its context, the\r\nprescription requirement is better understood as a provi-\r\nsion that ensures patients use controlled substances under\r\nthe supervision of a doctor so as to prevent addiction and\r\nrecreational abuse. As a corollary, the provision also bars\r\ndoctors from peddling to patients who crave the drugs for\r\nthose prohibited uses. See Moore, 423 U. S., at 135, 143.\r\nTo read prescriptions for assisted suicide as constituting\r\n“drug abuse” under the CSA is discordant with the\r\nphrase’s consistent use throughout the statute, not to\r\nmention its ordinary meaning.\r\n   The Government’s interpretation of the prescription\r\nrequirement also fails under the objection that the Attorney\r\nGeneral is an unlikely recipient of such broad authority,\r\ngiven the Secretary’s primacy in shaping medical policy\r\nunder the CSA, and the statute’s otherwise careful alloca-\r\n28                  GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntion of decisionmaking powers. Just as the conventions of\r\nexpression indicate that Congress is unlikely to alter a\r\nstatute’s obvious scope and division of authority through\r\nmuffled hints, the background principles of our federal\r\nsystem also belie the notion that Congress would use such\r\nan obscure grant of authority to regulate areas tradition-\r\nally supervised by the States’ police power. It is unneces-\r\nsary even to consider the application of clear statement\r\nrequirements, see, e.g., United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336,\r\n349 (1971); cf. BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation, 511\r\nU. S. 531, 544–546 (1994), or presumptions against pre-\r\nemption, see, e.g., Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536\r\nU. S. 355, 387 (2002), to reach this commonsense conclusion.\r\nFor all these reasons, we conclude the CSA’s prescription\r\nrequirement does not authorize the Attorney General to\r\nbar dispensing controlled substances for assisted suicide\r\nin the face of a state medical regime permitting such\r\nconduct.\r\n                              IV\r\n  The Government, in the end, maintains that the pre-\r\nscription requirement delegates to a single Executive\r\nofficer the power to effect a radical shift of authority from\r\nthe States to the Federal Government to define general\r\nstandards of medical practice in every locality. The text\r\nand structure of the CSA show that Congress did not have\r\nthis far-reaching intent to alter the federal-state balance\r\nand the congressional role in maintaining it.\r\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\r\n                                                    Affirmed.\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U.

OREGON ET AL.\r\n\r\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\r\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\r\n                      [January 17, 2006]\r\n\r\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS\r\nand JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.\r\n  The Court concludes that the Attorney General lacked\r\nauthority to declare assisted suicide illicit under the Con-\r\ntrolled Substances Act (CSA), because the CSA is con-\r\ncerned only with “illicit drug dealing and trafficking,”\r\nante, at 23 (emphasis added). This question-begging\r\nconclusion is obscured by a flurry of arguments that dis-\r\ntort the statute and disregard settled principles of our\r\ninterpretive jurisprudence.\r\n  Contrary to the Court’s analysis, this case involves not\r\none but three independently sufficient grounds for revers-\r\ning the Ninth Circuit’s judgment. First, the Attorney\r\nGeneral’s interpretation of “legitimate medical purpose” in\r\n21 CFR §1306.04 (2005) (hereinafter Regulation) is clearly\r\nvalid, given the substantial deference we must accord it\r\nunder Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997), and his\r\ntwo remaining conclusions follow naturally from this\r\ninterpretation. See Part I, infra. Second, even if this\r\ninterpretation of the Regulation is entitled to lesser defer-\r\nence or no deference at all, it is by far the most natural\r\ninterpretation of the Regulation—whose validity is not\r\nchallenged here. This interpretation is thus correct even\r\nupon de novo review. See Part II, infra. Third, even if\r\nthat interpretation of the Regulation were incorrect, the\r\n2                  GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nAttorney General’s independent interpretation of the\r\nstatutory phrase “public interest” in 21 U. S. C. §§824(a)\r\nand 823(f), and his implicit interpretation of the statutory\r\nphrase “public health and safety” in §823(f)(5), are entitled\r\nto deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-\r\nsources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), and\r\nthey are valid under Chevron. See Part III, infra. For\r\nthese reasons, I respectfully dissent.\r\n                              I\r\n  The Interpretive Rule issued by the Attorney General\r\n(hereinafter Directive) provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n    “For the reasons set forth in the OLC Opinion, I\r\n    hereby determine that assisting suicide is not a ‘le-\r\n    gitimate medical purpose’ within the meaning of 21\r\n    CFR §1306.04 (2001), and that prescribing, dispens-\r\n    ing, or administering federally controlled substances\r\n    to assist suicide violates the CSA. Such conduct by a\r\n    physician registered to dispense controlled substances\r\n    may ‘render his registration . . . inconsistent with the\r\n    public interest’ and therefore subject to possible sus-\r\n    pension or revocation under 21 U. S. C. [§]824(a)(4).”\r\n    66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (2001).\r\nThe Directive thus purports to do three distinct things: (1)\r\nto interpret the phrase “legitimate medical purpose” in the\r\nRegulation to exclude physician-assisted suicide; (2) to\r\ndetermine that prescribing, dispensing, and administering\r\nfederally controlled substances to assist suicide violates\r\nthe CSA; and (3) to determine that participating in physi-\r\ncian-assisted suicide may render a practitioner’s registra-\r\ntion “inconsistent with the public interest” within the\r\nmeaning of 21 U. S. C. §§823(f) and 824(a)(4) (which in-\r\ncorporates §823(f) by reference). The Court’s analysis\r\nsuffers from an unremitting failure to distinguish among\r\nthese distinct propositions in the Directive.\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n   As an initial matter, the validity of the Regulation’s\r\ninterpretation of “prescription” in §829 to require a “le-\r\ngitimate medical purpose” is not at issue. Respondents\r\nconceded the validity of this interpretation in the lower\r\ncourt, see Oregon v. Ashcroft, 368 F. 3d 1118, 1133 (CA9\r\n2004), and they have not challenged it here. By its asser-\r\ntion that the Regulation merely restates the statutory\r\nstandard of 21 U. S. C. §830(b)(3)(A)(ii), see ante, at 10,\r\nthe Court likewise accepts that the “legitimate medical\r\npurpose” interpretation for prescriptions is proper. See\r\nalso ante, at 11 (referring to “legitimate medical purpose”\r\nas a “statutory phrase”). It is beyond dispute, then, that a\r\n“prescription” under §829 must issue for a “legitimate\r\nmedical purpose.”\r\n                               A\r\n   Because the Regulation was promulgated by the Attor-\r\nney General, and because the Directive purported to in-\r\nterpret the language of the Regulation, see 66 Fed. Reg.\r\n56608, this case calls for the straightforward application of\r\nour rule that an agency’s interpretation of its own regula-\r\ntions is “controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsis-\r\ntent with the regulation.” Auer, supra, at 461 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). The Court reasons that Auer is\r\ninapplicable because the Regulation “does little more than\r\nrestate the terms of the statute itself.” Ante, at 9. “Simply\r\nput,” the Court asserts, “the existence of a parroting regu-\r\nlation does not change the fact that the question here is\r\nnot the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the\r\nstatute.” Ante, at 10.\r\n   To begin with, it is doubtful that any such exception to\r\nthe Auer rule exists. The Court cites no authority for it,\r\nbecause there is none. To the contrary, our unanimous\r\ndecision in Auer makes clear that broadly drawn regula-\r\ntions are entitled to no less respect than narrow ones. “A\r\nrule requiring the Secretary to construe his own regula-\r\n4                   GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntions narrowly would make little sense, since he is free to\r\nwrite the regulations as broadly as he wishes, subject only\r\nto the limits imposed by the statute.” 519 U. S., at 463\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n   Even if there were an antiparroting canon, however, it\r\nwould have no application here. The Court’s description of\r\n21 CFR §1306.04 (2005) as a regulation that merely “para-\r\nphrase[s] the statutory language,” ante, at 10, is demon-\r\nstrably false. In relevant part, the Regulation interprets\r\nthe word “prescription” as it appears in 21 U. S. C. §829,\r\nwhich governs the dispensation of controlled substances\r\nother than those on Schedule I (which may not be dis-\r\npensed at all). Entitled “[p]rescriptions,” §829 requires,\r\nwith certain exceptions not relevant here, “the written\r\nprescription of a practitioner” (usually a medical doctor)\r\nfor the dispensation of Schedule II substances (§829(a)), “a\r\nwritten or oral prescription” for substances on Schedules\r\nIII and IV (§829(b)), and no prescription but merely a\r\n“medical purpose” for the dispensation of Schedule V\r\nsubstances (§829(c)).\r\n   As used in this section, “prescription” is susceptible of at\r\nleast three reasonable interpretations. First, it might\r\nmean any oral or written direction of a practitioner for the\r\ndispensation of drugs. See United States v. Moore, 423\r\nU. S. 122, 137, n. 13 (1975) (“On its face §829 addresses\r\nonly the form that a prescription must take. . . . [Section]\r\n829 by its terms does not limit the authority of a practitio-\r\nner”). Second, in light of the requirement of a “medical\r\npurpose” for the dispensation of Schedule V substances,\r\nsee §829(c), it might mean a practitioner’s oral or written\r\ndirection for the dispensation of drugs that the practitio-\r\nner believes to be for a legitimate medical purpose. See\r\nWebster’s New International Dictionary 1954 (2d ed. 1950)\r\n(hereinafter Webster’s Second) (defining “prescription” as\r\n“[a] written direction for the preparation and use of a\r\nmedicine”); id., at 1527 (defining “medicine” as “[a]ny\r\n                     Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                    5\r\n\r\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nsubstance or preparation used in treating disease”) (em-\r\nphases added). Finally, “prescription” might refer to a\r\npractitioner’s direction for the dispensation of drugs that\r\nserves an objectively legitimate medical purpose, regard-\r\nless of the practitioner’s subjective judgment about the\r\nlegitimacy of the anticipated use. See ibid.\r\n  The Regulation at issue constricts or clarifies the stat-\r\nute by adopting the last and narrowest of these three\r\npossible interpretations of the undefined statutory term:\r\n“A prescription for a controlled substance to be effective\r\nmust be issued for a legitimate medical purpose . . . .” 21\r\nCFR §1306.04(a) (2005). We have previously acknowl-\r\nedged that the Regulation gives added content to the text\r\nof the statute: “The medical purpose requirement explicit\r\nin subsection (c) [of §829] could be implicit in subsections\r\n(a) and (b). Regulation §[1]306.04 makes it explicit.” Moore,\r\nsupra, at 137, n. 13.1\r\n  The Court points out that the Regulation adopts some of\r\nthe phrasing employed in unrelated sections of the stat-\r\nute. See ante, at 10. This is irrelevant. A regulation that\r\nsignificantly clarifies the meaning of an otherwise am-\r\nbiguous statutory provision is not a “parroting” regulation,\r\nregardless of the sources that the agency draws upon for\r\nthe clarification. Moreover, most of the statutory phrases\r\nthat the Court cites as appearing in the Regulation, see\r\nibid. (citing 21 U. S. C. §§812(b) (“ ‘currently accepted\r\nmedical use’ ”), 829(c) (“ ‘medical purpose’ ”), 802(21) (“ ‘in\r\nthe course of professional practice’ ”)), are inapposite be-\r\n——————\r\n  1 To be sure, this acknowledgment did not go far enough, because it\r\noverlooked the significance of the word “legitimate,” which is most\r\nnaturally understood to create an objective, federal standard for appro-\r\npriate medical uses. See Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.\r\nHolyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 43 (1989) (“We start . . . with the general as-\r\nsumption that in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary, . . .\r\nCongress when it enacts a statute is not making the application of the\r\nfederal act dependent on state law” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\n6                       GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncause they do not “parrot” the only phrase in the Regula-\r\ntion that the Directive purported to construe. See 66 Fed.\r\nReg. 56608 (“I hereby determine that assisting suicide is\r\nnot a ‘legitimate medical purpose’ within the meaning of\r\n21 CFR §1306.04 . . .”). None of them includes the key\r\nword “legitimate,” which gives the most direct support to\r\nthe Directive’s theory that §829(c) presupposes a uniform\r\nfederal standard of medical practice.2\r\n   Since the Regulation does not run afowl (so to speak) of\r\nthe Court’s newly invented prohibition of “parroting”; and\r\nsince the Directive represents the agency’s own interpre-\r\ntation of that concededly valid regulation; the only ques-\r\ntion remaining is whether that interpretation is “plainly\r\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation”; otherwise,\r\nit is “controlling.” Auer, supra, at 461 (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted). This is not a difficult question. The\r\nDirective is assuredly valid insofar as it interprets “pre-\r\nscription” to require a medical purpose that is “legitimate”\r\nas a matter of federal law—since that is an interpretation\r\nof “prescription” that we ourselves have adopted. Webb v.\r\nUnited States, 249 U. S. 96 (1919), was a prosecution\r\n——————\r\n   2 The only place outside 21 U. S. C. §801 in which the statute uses the\r\n\r\nphrase “legitimate medical purpose” is in defining the phrase “valid\r\nprescription” for purposes of the reporting requirements that apply to\r\nmail orders of regulated substances. See §830(b)(3)(A)(ii). The Regula-\r\ntion did not “parrot” this statutory section, because the Regulation was\r\nadopted in 1971 and the statutory language was added in 2000. See\r\nBrief for Petitioners 17 (citing the Children’s Health Act of 2000, §3652,\r\n114 Stat. 1239, 21 U. S. C. §830(b)(3)). But even if the statutory lan-\r\nguage had predated the Regulation, there would be no “parroting” of\r\nthat phrase. In using the word “prescription” without definition in the\r\nmuch more critical §829, Congress left the task of resolving any ambi-\r\nguity in that word, used in that context, to the relevant Executive\r\nofficer. That the officer did so by deeming relevant a technically\r\ninapplicable statutory definition contained elsewhere in the statute\r\ndoes not make him a parrot. He has given to the statutory text a\r\nmeaning it did not explicitly—and perhaps even not necessarily—\r\ncontain.\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U.

The dispositive\r\nissue in the case was whether such authorizations were\r\n“prescriptions” within the meaning of §2(b) of the Harrison\r\nAct, predecessor to the CSA. Ibid. We held that “to call\r\nsuch an order for the use of morphine a physician’s pre-\r\nscription would be so plain a perversion of meaning that\r\nno discussion of the subject is required.” Id., at 99–100.\r\nLike the Directive, this interprets “prescription” to require\r\nmedical purpose that is legitimate as a matter of federal\r\nlaw. And the Directive is also assuredly valid insofar as it\r\ninterprets “legitimate medical purpose” as a matter of\r\nfederal law to exclude physician-assisted suicide, because\r\nthat is not only a permissible but indeed the most natural\r\ninterpretation of that phrase. See Part II, infra.\r\n                             B\r\n   Even if the Regulation merely parroted the statute, and\r\nthe Directive therefore had to be treated as though it\r\nconstrued the statute directly, see ante, at 11, the Direc-\r\ntive would still be entitled to deference under Chevron.\r\nThe Court does not take issue with the Solicitor General’s\r\ncontention that no alleged procedural defect, such as the\r\nabsence of notice-and-comment rulemaking before prom-\r\nulgation of the Directive, renders Chevron inapplicable\r\nhere. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 4 (citing Barnhart v.\r\nWalton, 535 U. S. 212, 219–222 (2002); 5 U. S. C. §553(b)(3)(A)\r\n(exempting interpretive rules from notice-and-comment\r\nrulemaking)). Instead, the Court holds that the Attorney\r\nGeneral lacks interpretive authority to issue the Directive\r\nat all, on the ground that the explicit delegation provision,\r\n21 U. S. C.

OREGON\r\n\r\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntion of the prescription requirement. See ante, at 12–14.\r\n   Setting aside the implicit delegation inherent in Con-\r\ngress’s use of the undefined term “prescription” in §829,\r\nthe Court’s reading of “control” in §821 is manifestly erro-\r\nneous. The Court urges, ante, at 12–13, that “control” is a\r\nterm defined in part A of the subchapter (entitled “Intro-\r\nductory Provisions”) to mean “to add a drug or other sub-\r\nstance . . . to a schedule under part B of this subchapter,”\r\n21 U. S. C. §802(5) (emphasis added). But §821 is not\r\nincluded in “part B of this subchapter,” which is entitled\r\n“Authority to Control; Standards and Schedules,” and\r\nconsists of the sections related to scheduling, 21\r\nU. S. C. A. §§811–814 (main ed. and Supp. 2005), where\r\nthe statutory definition is uniquely appropriate. Rather,\r\n§821 is found in part C of the subchapter, §§821–830,\r\nentitled “Registration of Manufacturers, Distributors, and\r\nDispensers of Controlled Substances,” which includes all\r\nand only the provisions relating to the “manufacture,\r\ndistribution, and dispensing of controlled substances,”\r\n§821. The artificial definition of “control” in §802(5) has\r\nno conceivable application to the use of that word in §821.\r\nUnder that definition, “control” must take a substance as\r\nits direct object, see 21 U. S. C. §802(5) (“to add a drug or\r\nother substance . . . to a schedule”)—and that is how “con-\r\ntrol” is consistently used throughout part B. See, e.g.,\r\n§§811(b) (“proceedings . . . to control a drug or other sub-\r\nstance”), 811(c) (“each drug or other substance proposed to\r\nbe controlled or removed from the schedules”), 811(d)(1)\r\n(“If control is required . . . the Attorney General shall issue\r\nan order controlling such drug . . .”), 812(b) (“Except where\r\ncontrol is required . . . a drug or other substance may not\r\nbe placed in any schedule . . .”). In §821, by contrast, the\r\nterm “control” has as its object, not “a drug or other sub-\r\nstance,” but rather the processes of “manufacture, distri-\r\nbution, and dispensing of controlled substances.” It could\r\nnot be clearer that the artificial definition of “control” in\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U.

It makes no sense to speak of\r\n“adding the manufacturing, distribution, and dispensing of\r\nsubstances to a schedule.” We do not force term-of-art\r\ndefinitions into contexts where they plainly do not fit and\r\nproduce nonsense. What is obviously intended in §821 is\r\nthe ordinary meaning of “control”—namely, “[t]o exercise\r\nrestraining or directing influence over; to dominate; regu-\r\nlate; hence, to hold from action; to curb,” Webster’s Second\r\n580. “Control” is regularly used in this ordinary sense\r\nelsewhere in part C of the subchapter. See, e.g., 21\r\nU. S. C. §§823(a)(1), (b)(1), (d)(1), (e)(1), (h)(1) (“mainte-\r\nnance of effective controls against diversion”); §§823(a)(5),\r\n(d)(5) (“establishment of effective control against diver-\r\nsion”); §823(g)(2)(H)(i) (“to exercise supervision or control\r\nover the practice of medicine”); §830(b)(1)(C) (“a listed\r\nchemical under the control of the regulated person”);\r\n§830(c)(2)(D) (“chemical control laws”) (emphases added).\r\n   When the word is given its ordinary meaning, the At-\r\ntorney General’s interpretation of the prescription re-\r\nquirement of §829 plainly “relat[es] to the . . . control of\r\nthe . . . dispensing of controlled substances,” 21 U. S. C. A.\r\n§821 (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added), since a prescription\r\nis the chief requirement for “dispensing” such drugs, see\r\n§829. The same meaning is compelled by the fact that\r\n§821 is the first section not of part B of the subchapter,\r\nwhich deals entirely with “control” in the artificial sense,\r\nbut of part C, every section of which relates to the “regis-\r\ntration and control of the manufacture, distribution, and\r\ndispensing of controlled substances,” §821. See §§822\r\n(persons required to register), 823 (registration require-\r\nments), 824 (denial, revocation, or suspension of registra-\r\ntion), 825 (labeling and packaging), 826 (production quotas\r\nfor controlled substances), 827 (recordkeeping and report-\r\ning requirements of registrants), 828 (order forms), 829\r\n(prescription requirements), 830 (regulation of listed\r\nchemicals and certain machines). It would be peculiar for\r\n10                      GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe first section of this part to authorize rulemaking for\r\nmatters covered by the previous part. The only sensible\r\ninterpretation of §821 is that it gives the Attorney General\r\ninterpretive authority over the provisions of part C, all of\r\nwhich “relat[e] to the registration and control of the manu-\r\nfacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled sub-\r\nstances.” These provisions include both the prescription\r\nrequirement of §829, and the criteria for registration and\r\nderegistration of §§823 and 824 (as relevant below, see\r\nPart III, infra).3\r\n                              C\r\n   In sum, the Directive’s construction of “legitimate medi-\r\ncal purpose” is a perfectly valid agency interpretation of\r\nits own regulation; and if not that, a perfectly valid agency\r\ninterpretation of the statute. No one contends that the\r\nconstruction is “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\r\nregulation,” Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325\r\nU. S. 410, 414 (1945), or beyond the scope of ambiguity in\r\nthe statute, see Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843. In fact, as\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  3 The Court concludes that “[e]ven if ‘control’ in §821 were understood\r\nto signify something other than its statutory definition, it would not\r\nsupport the Interpretive Rule.” Ante, at 13. That conclusion rests upon\r\na misidentification of the text that the Attorney General, pursuant to\r\nhis “control” authority, is interpreting. No one argues that the word\r\n“control” in §821 gives the Attorney General “authority to define\r\ndiversion based on his view of legitimate medical practice,” ibid.\r\nRather, that word authorizes the Attorney General to interpret (among\r\nother things) the “prescription” requirement of §829. The question then\r\nbecomes whether the phrase “legitimate medical purpose” (which all\r\nagree is included in “prescription”) is at least open to the interpretation\r\nannounced in the Directive. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc., v. Natural\r\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984). And of\r\ncourse it is—as the Court effectively concedes two pages earlier: “All\r\nwould agree, we should think, that the statutory phrase ‘legitimate\r\nmedical purpose’ is a generality, susceptible to more precise definition\r\nand open to varying constructions, and thus ambiguous in the relevant\r\nsense.” Ante, at 11 (citing Chevron).\r\n                    Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                  11\r\n\r\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nexplained below, the Directive provides the most natural\r\ninterpretation of the Regulation and of the statute. The\r\nDirective thus definitively establishes that a doctor’s order\r\nauthorizing the dispensation of a Schedule II substance for\r\nthe purpose of assisting a suicide is not a “prescription”\r\nwithin the meaning of §829.\r\n   Once this conclusion is established, the other two con-\r\nclusions in the Directive follow inevitably. Under our\r\nreasoning in Moore, writing prescriptions that are ille-\r\ngitimate under §829 is certainly not “in the [usual] course\r\nof professional practice” under §802(21) and thus not\r\n“authorized by this subchapter” under §841(a). See 423\r\nU. S., at 138, 140–141. A doctor who does this may thus\r\nbe prosecuted under §841(a), and so it follows that such\r\nconduct “violates the Controlled Substances Act,” 66 Fed.\r\nReg. 56608. And since such conduct is thus not in\r\n“[c]ompliance with applicable . . . Federal . . . laws relating\r\nto controlled substances,” 21 U. S. C. §823(f)(4), and may\r\nalso be fairly judged to “threaten the public health and\r\nsafety,” §823(f)(5), it follows that “[s]uch conduct by a\r\nphysician registered to dispense controlled substances\r\nmay ‘render his registration . . . inconsistent with the\r\npublic interest’ and therefore subject to possible suspen-\r\nsion or revocation under 21 U. S. C. [§]824(a)(4).” 66 Fed.\r\nReg. 56608 (emphases added).\r\n                           II\r\n  Even if the Directive were entitled to no deference\r\nwhatever, the most reasonable interpretation of the Regu-\r\nlation and of the statute would produce the same result.\r\nVirtually every relevant source of authoritative meaning\r\nconfirms that the phrase “legitimate medical purpose”4\r\n——————\r\n  4 This phrase appears only in the Regulation and not in the relevant\r\nsection of the statute. But as pointed out earlier, the Court does not\r\ncontest that this is the most reasonable interpretation of the section—\r\nregarding it, indeed, as a mere “parroting” of the statute.\r\n12                 GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ndoes not include intentionally assisting suicide. “Medi-\r\ncine” refers to “[t]he science and art dealing with the\r\nprevention, cure, or alleviation of disease.” Webster’s\r\nSecond 1527. The use of the word “legitimate” connotes an\r\nobjective standard of “medicine,” and our presumption that\r\nthe CSA creates a uniform federal law regulating the\r\ndispensation of controlled substances, see Mississippi\r\nBand of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 43\r\n(1989), means that this objective standard must be a\r\nfederal one. As recounted in detail in the memorandum\r\nfor the Attorney General that is attached as an appendix\r\nto the Directive (OLC Memo), virtually every medical\r\nauthority from Hippocrates to the current American Medi-\r\ncal Association (AMA) confirms that assisting suicide has\r\nseldom or never been viewed as a form of “prevention,\r\ncure, or alleviation of disease,” and (even more so) that\r\nassisting suicide is not a “legitimate” branch of that “sci-\r\nence and art.” See OLC Memo, App. to Pet. for Cert.\r\n113a–130a.        Indeed, the AMA has determined that\r\n“ ‘[p]hysician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompati-\r\nble with the physician’s role as a healer.’ ” Washington v.\r\nGlucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 731 (1997). “[T]he overwhelm-\r\ning weight of authority in judicial decisions, the past and\r\npresent policies of nearly all of the States and of the Fed-\r\neral Government, and the clear, firm and unequivocal\r\nviews of the leading associations within the American\r\nmedical and nursing professions, establish that assisting\r\nin suicide . . . is not a legitimate medical purpose.” OLC\r\nMemo, supra, at 129a. See also Glucksberg, supra, at 710,\r\nn. 8 (prohibitions or condemnations of assisted suicide in\r\n50 jurisdictions, including 47 States, the District of Co-\r\nlumbia, and 2 Territories).\r\n    In the face of this “overwhelming weight of authority,”\r\nthe Court’s admission that “[o]n its own, this understand-\r\ning of medicine’s boundaries is at least reasonable,” ante,\r\nat 26 (emphasis added), tests the limits of understate-\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)          13\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nment. The only explanation for such a distortion is that\r\nthe Court confuses the normative inquiry of what the\r\nboundaries of medicine should be—which it is laudably\r\nhesitant to undertake—with the objective inquiry of what\r\nthe accepted definition of “medicine” is. The same confu-\r\nsion is reflected in the Court’s remarkable statement that\r\n“[t]he primary problem with the Government’s argument\r\n. . . is its assumption that the CSA impliedly authorizes an\r\nExecutive officer to bar a use simply because it may be\r\ninconsistent with one reasonable understanding of medical\r\npractice.” Ibid. (emphasis added). The fact that many in\r\nOregon believe that the boundaries of “legitimate medi-\r\ncine” should be extended to include assisted suicide does\r\nnot change the fact that the overwhelming weight of au-\r\nthority (including the 47 States that condemn physician-\r\nassisted suicide) confirms that they have not yet been so\r\nextended. Not even those of our Eighth Amendment cases\r\nmost generous in discerning an “evolution” of national\r\nstandards would have found, on this record, that the\r\nconcept of “legitimate medicine” has evolved so far. See\r\nRoper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 564–567 (2005).\r\n    The Court contends that the phrase “legitimate medical\r\npurpose” cannot be read to establish a broad, uniform\r\nfederal standard for the medically proper use of controlled\r\nsubstances. Ante, at 22. But it also rejects the most plau-\r\nsible alternative proposition, urged by the State, that any\r\nuse authorized under state law constitutes a “legitimate\r\nmedical purpose.” (The Court is perhaps leery of embrac-\r\ning this position because the State candidly admitted at\r\noral argument that, on its view, a State could exempt from\r\nthe CSA’s coverage the use of morphine to achieve eupho-\r\nria.) Instead, the Court reverse-engineers an approach\r\nsomewhere between a uniform national standard and a\r\nstate-by-state approach, holding (with no basis in the\r\nCSA’s text) that “legitimate medical purpose” refers to all\r\nuses of drugs unrelated to “addiction and recreational\r\n14                  GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nabuse.” Ante, at 27. Thus, though the Court pays lipser-\r\nvice to state autonomy, see ante, 23–24, its standard for\r\n“legitimate medical purpose” is in fact a hazily defined\r\nfederal standard based on its purposive reading of the\r\nCSA, and extracted from obliquely relevant sections of the\r\nAct. In particular, relying on its observation that the\r\ncriteria for scheduling controlled substances are primarily\r\nconcerned with “addiction or abnormal effects on the\r\nnervous system,” ante, at 26–27 (citing 21 U. S. C.\r\n§§811(c)(7), 812(b), 811(f), 801a), the Court concludes that\r\nthe CSA’s prescription requirement must be interpreted in\r\nlight of this narrow view of the statute’s purpose.\r\n   Even assuming, however, that the principal concern of\r\nthe CSA is the curtailment of “addiction and recreational\r\nabuse,” there is no reason to think that this is its exclusive\r\nconcern. We have repeatedly observed that Congress often\r\npasses statutes that sweep more broadly than the main\r\nproblem they were designed to address. “[S]tatutory\r\nprohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover\r\nreasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the\r\nprovisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns\r\nof our legislators by which we are governed.” Oncale v.\r\nSundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79 (1998).\r\nSee also H. J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492\r\nU. S. 229, 248 (1989).\r\n   The scheduling provisions of the CSA on which the\r\nCourt relies confirm that the CSA’s “design,” ante, at 23, is\r\nnot as narrow as the Court asserts. In making scheduling\r\ndeterminations, the Attorney General must not only con-\r\nsider a drug’s “psychic or physiological dependence liabil-\r\nity” as the Court points out, ante, at 26 (citing 21 U. S. C.\r\n§811(c)(7)), but must also consider such broad factors as\r\n“[t]he state of current scientific knowledge regarding the\r\ndrug or other substance,” §811(c)(3), and (most notably)\r\n“[w]hat, if any, risk there is to the public health,”\r\n§811(c)(6). If the latter factor were limited to addiction-\r\n                   Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)              15\r\n\r\n                       SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nrelated health risks, as the Court supposes, it would be\r\nredundant of §811(c)(7). Moreover, in making registration\r\ndeterminations regarding manufacturers and distributors,\r\nthe Attorney General “shall” consider “such other factors\r\nas may be relevant to and consistent with the public\r\nhealth and safety,” §§823(a)(6), (b)(5), (d)(6), (e)(5) (em-\r\nphasis added)—over and above the risk of “diversion” of\r\ncontrolled substances, §§823(a)(1), (a)(5), (b)(1), (d)(1),\r\n(d)(5), (e)(1). And, most relevant of all, in registering and\r\nderegistering physicians, the Attorney General “may deny\r\nan application for such registration if he determines that\r\nthe issuance of such registration would be inconsistent\r\nwith the public interest,” §823(f); see also §824(a)(4), and\r\nin making that determination “shall” consider “[s]uch\r\nother conduct which may threaten the public health and\r\nsafety,” §823(f)(5). All of these provisions, not just those\r\nselectively cited by the Court, shed light upon the CSA’s\r\nrepeated references to the undefined term “abuse.” See\r\n§§811(a)(1)(A), (c)(1), (c)(4), (c)(5); §§812(b)(1)(A), (b)(2)(A),\r\n(b)(3)(A), (b)(4)(A), (b)(5)(A).\r\n  By disregarding all these public-interest, public-health,\r\nand public-safety objectives, and limiting the CSA to\r\n“addiction and recreational abuse,” the Court rules out the\r\nprohibition of anabolic-steroid use for bodybuilding pur-\r\nposes. It seeks to avoid this consequence by invoking the\r\nAnabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 4851.\r\nAnte, at 27. But the only effect of that legislation is to\r\nmake anabolic steroids controlled drugs under Schedule\r\nIII of the CSA. If the only basis for control is (as the Court\r\nsays) “addiction and recreational abuse,” dispensation of\r\nthese drugs for bodybuilding could not be proscribed.\r\n  Although, as I have described, the Court’s opinion no\r\nmore defers to state law than does the Directive, the Court\r\nrelies on two provisions for the conclusion that “[t]he\r\nstructure and operation of the CSA presume and rely upon\r\na functioning medical profession regulated under the\r\n16                      GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nStates’ police powers,” ante, at 23—namely the registra-\r\ntion provisions of §823(f) and the nonpre-emption provi-\r\nsion of §903. Reliance on the former is particularly unfor-\r\ntunate, because the Court’s own analysis recounts how\r\nCongress amended §823(f) in 1984 in order to liberate the\r\nAttorney General’s power over registration from the con-\r\ntrol of state regulators. See ante, at 14; 21 U. S. C. §823(f);\r\nsee also Brief for Petitioners 34–35. And the nonpre-\r\nemption clause is embarrassingly inapplicable, since it\r\nmerely disclaims field pre-emption, and affirmatively\r\nprescribes federal pre-emption whenever state law creates\r\na conflict.5 In any event, the Directive does not purport to\r\npre-empt state law in any way, not even by conflict pre-\r\nemption—unless the Court is under the misimpression\r\nthat some States require assisted suicide. The Directive\r\nmerely interprets the CSA to prohibit, like countless other\r\nfederal criminal provisions, conduct that happens not to be\r\nforbidden under state law (or at least the law of the State\r\nof Oregon).\r\n   With regard to the CSA’s registration provisions, 21\r\nU. S. C. §§823(f), 824(a), the Court argues that the statute\r\ncannot fairly be read to “ ‘hide elephants in mouseholes’ ”\r\nby delegating to the Attorney General the power to deter-\r\nmine the legitimacy of medical practices in “ ‘vague terms\r\nor ancillary provisions.’ ” Ante, at 20 (quoting Whitman v.\r\nAmerican Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001)).\r\nThis case bears not the remotest resemblance to Whitman,\r\nwhich held that “Congress . . . does not alter the funda-\r\nmental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or\r\nancillary provisions.” Ibid. (emphasis added). The Attor-\r\nney General’s power to issue regulations against question-\r\n——————\r\n  5 Title 21 U. S. C. §903 reads, in relevant part, as follows: “No provi-\r\n\r\nsion of this subchapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the\r\npart of the Congress to occupy the field in which that provision oper-\r\nates, including criminal penalties, to the exclusion of any State law on\r\nthe same subject matter . . . unless there is a positive conflict . . . .”\r\n                      Cite as: 546 U.

I am aware of only four\r\nareas in which the Department of Justice has exercised\r\nthat power to regulate uses of controlled substances unre-\r\nlated to “addiction and recreational abuse” as the Court\r\napparently understands that phrase: assisted suicide,\r\naggressive pain management therapy, anabolic-steroid\r\nuse, and cosmetic weight-loss therapy. See, e.g., In re\r\nHarline, 65 Fed. Reg. 5665, 5667 (2000) (weight loss); In re\r\nTecca, 62 Fed. Reg. 12842, 12846 (1997) (anabolic ster-\r\noids); In re Roth, 60 Fed. Reg. 62262, 62263, 62267 (1995)\r\n(pain management). There is no indication that enforce-\r\nment in these areas interferes with the prosecution of\r\n“drug abuse” as the Court understands it. Unlike in\r\nWhitman, the Attorney General’s additional power to\r\naddress other forms of drug “abuse” does absolutely noth-\r\ning to undermine the central features of this regulatory\r\nscheme. Of course it was critical to our analysis in Whit-\r\nman that the language of the provision did not bear the\r\nmeaning that respondents sought to give it. See 531 U. S.,\r\nat 465. Here, for the reasons stated above, the provision is\r\nmost naturally interpreted to incorporate a uniform fed-\r\neral standard for legitimacy of medical practice.6\r\n  Finally, respondents argue that the Attorney General\r\nmust defer to state-law judgments about what constitutes\r\nlegitimate medicine, on the ground that Congress must\r\nspeak clearly to impose such a uniform federal standard\r\nupon the States. But no line of our clear-statement cases\r\n——————\r\n  6 The other case cited by the Court, FDA v. Brown & Williamson To-\r\nbacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120 (2000), is even more obviously inapt. There\r\nwe relied on the first step of the Chevron analysis to determine that\r\nCongress had spoken to the precise issue in question, impliedly repeal-\r\ning the grant of jurisdiction on which the FDA relied. 529 U. S., at\r\n160–161. Here, Congress has not expressly or impliedly authorized the\r\npractice of assisted suicide, or indeed “spoken directly” to the subject in\r\nany way beyond the text of the CSA.\r\n18                  GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nis applicable here. The canon of avoidance does not apply,\r\nsince the Directive does not push the outer limits of Con-\r\ngress’s commerce power, compare Solid Waste Agency of\r\nNorthern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S.\r\n159, 172 (2001) (regulation of isolated ponds), with United\r\nStates v. Sullivan, 332 U. S. 689, 698 (1948) (regulation of\r\nlabeling of drugs shipped in interstate commerce), or\r\nimpinge on a core aspect of state sovereignty, cf. Atasca-\r\ndero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985)\r\n(sovereign immunity); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452,\r\n460 (1991) (qualifications of state government officials).\r\nThe clear-statement rule based on the presumption\r\nagainst pre-emption does not apply because the Directive\r\ndoes not pre-empt any state law, cf. id., at 456–457; Rush\r\nPrudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355, 359 (2002).\r\nAnd finally, no clear statement is required on the ground\r\nthat the Directive intrudes upon an area traditionally\r\nreserved exclusively to the States, cf. BFP v. Resolution\r\nTrust Corporation, 511 U. S. 531, 544 (1994) (state regula-\r\ntion of titles to real property), because the Federal Gov-\r\nernment has pervasively regulated the dispensation of\r\ndrugs for over 100 years. See generally Brief for Pro-Life\r\nLegal Defense Fund et al. as Amici Curiae 3–15. It would\r\nbe a novel and massive expansion of the clear-statement\r\nrule to apply it in a commerce case not involving pre-\r\nemption or constitutional avoidance, merely because Con-\r\ngress has chosen to prohibit conduct that a State has made\r\na contrary policy judgment to permit.

S. C. [§]824(a)(4),” 66 Fed. Reg. 56608, would neverthe-\r\nless be unassailable in this Court.\r\n   Sections 823(f) and 824(a) explicitly grant the Attorney\r\nGeneral the authority to register and deregister physi-\r\ncians, and his discretion in exercising that authority is\r\nspelled out in very broad terms. He may refuse to register\r\nor deregister if he determines that registration is “incon-\r\nsistent with the public interest,” 21 U. S. C. §823(f), after\r\nconsidering five factors, the fifth of which is “[s]uch other\r\nconduct which may threaten the public health and safety,”\r\n§823(f)(5). See also In re Arora, 60 Fed. Reg. 4447, 4448\r\n(1995) (“It is well established that these factors are to be\r\nconsidered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administra-\r\ntor may properly rely on any one or a combination of\r\nfactors, and give each factor the weight he deems appro-\r\npriate”). As the Court points out, these broad standards\r\nwere enacted in the 1984 amendments for the specific\r\npurpose of freeing the Attorney General’s discretion over\r\nregistration from the decisions of state authorities. See\r\nante, at 13.\r\n   The fact that assisted-suicide prescriptions are issued in\r\nviolation of §829 is of course sufficient to support the\r\nDirective’s conclusion that issuing them may be cause for\r\nderegistration: such prescriptions would violate the fourth\r\nfactor of §823(f), namely “[c]ompliance with applicable . . .\r\nFederal . . . laws relating to controlled substances,” 21\r\nU. S. C. §823(f)(4). But the Attorney General did not rely\r\nsolely on subsection (f)(4) in reaching his conclusion that\r\nregistration would be “inconsistent with the public inter-\r\nest”; nothing in the text of the Directive indicates that.\r\nSubsection (f)(5) (“[s]uch other conduct which may threaten\r\nthe public health and safety”) provides an independent,\r\nalternative basis for the Directive’s conclusion regarding\r\nderegistration—provided that the Attorney General has\r\n20                   GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nauthority to interpret “public interest” and “public health\r\nand safety” in §823(f) to exclude assisted suicide.\r\n  Three considerations make it perfectly clear that the\r\nstatute confers authority to interpret these phrases upon\r\nthe Attorney General. First, the Attorney General is\r\nsolely and explicitly charged with administering the regis-\r\ntration and deregistration provisions. See §§823(f), 824(a).\r\nBy making the criteria for such registration and deregis-\r\ntration such obviously ambiguous factors as “public inter-\r\nest” and “public health and safety,” Congress implicitly\r\n(but clearly) gave the Attorney General authority to inter-\r\npret those criteria—whether or not there is any explicit\r\ndelegation provision in the statute. “Sometimes the legis-\r\nlative delegation to an agency on a particular question is\r\nimplicit rather than explicit. In such a case, a court may\r\nnot substitute its own construction of a statutory provision\r\nfor a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator\r\nof an agency.” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 844. The Court’s\r\nexclusive focus on the explicit delegation provisions is, at\r\nbest, a fossil of our pre-Chevron era; at least since Chev-\r\nron, we have not conditioned our deferral to agency inter-\r\npretations upon the existence of explicit delegation provi-\r\nsions. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229\r\n(2001), left this principle of implicit delegation intact.\r\n  Second, even if explicit delegation were required, Con-\r\ngress provided it in §821, which authorizes the Attorney\r\nGeneral to “promulgate rules and regulations . . . relating\r\nto the registration and control of the manufacture, distri-\r\nbution, and dispensing of controlled substances . . . .”\r\n(Emphasis added.) Because “dispensing” refers to the\r\ndelivery of a controlled substance “pursuant to the lawful\r\norder of, a practitioner,” 21 U. S. C. §802(10), the deregis-\r\ntration of such practitioners for writing impermissible\r\norders “relat[es] to the registration . . . of the . . . dispens-\r\ning” of controlled substances, 21 U. S. C. A. §821 (Supp.\r\n2005).\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n  Third, §821 also gives the Attorney General authority to\r\npromulgate rules and regulations “relating to the . . .\r\ncontrol of the . . . dispensing of controlled substances.” As\r\ndiscussed earlier, it is plain that the ordinary meaning of\r\n“control” must apply to §821, so that the plain import of\r\nthe provision is to grant the Attorney General rulemaking\r\nauthority over all the provisions of part C of the CSA, 21\r\nU. S. C. A. §§821–830 (main ed. and Supp. 2005). Regis-\r\ntering and deregistering the practitioners who issue the\r\nprescriptions necessary for lawful dispensation of con-\r\ntrolled substances plainly “relat[es] to the . . . control of\r\nthe . . . dispensing of controlled substances.” §821 (Supp.\r\n2005).\r\n  The Attorney General is thus authorized to promulgate\r\nregulations interpreting §§823(f) and 824(a), both by\r\nimplicit delegation in §823(f) and by two grounds of ex-\r\nplicit delegation in §821. The Court nevertheless holds\r\nthat this triply unambiguous delegation cannot be given\r\nfull effect because “the design of the statute,” ante, at 18,\r\nevinces the intent to grant the Secretary of Health and\r\nHuman Services exclusive authority over scientific and\r\nmedical determinations. This proposition is not remotely\r\nplausible. The Court cites as authority for the Secretary’s\r\nexclusive authority two specific areas in which his medical\r\ndeterminations are said to be binding on the Attorney\r\nGeneral—with regard to the “scientific and medical\r\nevaluation” of a drug’s effects that precedes its scheduling,\r\n§811(b), and with regard to “the appropriate methods of\r\nprofessional practice in the medical treatment of the nar-\r\ncotic addiction of various classes of narcotic addicts,” 42\r\nU. S. C. §290bb–2a; see also 21 U. S. C. §823(g) (2000 ed.\r\nand Supp. II). See ante, at 17–19. Far from establishing a\r\ngeneral principle of Secretary supremacy with regard to\r\nall scientific and medical determinations, the fact that\r\nCongress granted the Secretary specifically defined au-\r\nthority in the areas of scheduling and addiction treatment,\r\n22                 GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nwithout otherwise mentioning him in the registration\r\nprovisions, suggests, to the contrary, that Congress envi-\r\nsioned no role for the Secretary in that area—where, as we\r\nhave said, interpretive authority was both implicitly and\r\nexplicitly conferred upon the Attorney General.\r\n   Even if we could rewrite statutes to accord with sensible\r\n“design,” it is far from a certainty that the Secretary,\r\nrather than the Attorney General, ought to control the\r\nregistration of physicians. Though registration decisions\r\nsometimes require judgments about the legitimacy of\r\nmedical practices, the Department of Justice has seem-\r\ningly had no difficulty making them. See In re Harline, 65\r\nFed. Reg. 5665; In re Tecca, 62 Fed. Reg. 12842; In re\r\nRoth, 60 Fed. Reg. 62262. But unlike decisions about\r\nwhether a substance should be scheduled or whether a\r\nnarcotics addiction treatment is legitimate, registration\r\ndecisions are not exclusively, or even primarily, concerned\r\nwith “medical [and] scientific” factors. See 21 U. S. C.\r\n§823(f). Rather, the decision to register, or to bring an\r\naction to deregister, an individual physician implicates all\r\nthe policy goals and competing enforcement priorities that\r\nattend any exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is en-\r\ntirely reasonable to think (as Congress evidently did) that\r\nit would be easier for the Attorney General occasionally to\r\nmake judgments about the legitimacy of medical practices\r\nthan it would be for the Secretary to get into the business\r\nof law enforcement. It is, in other words, perfectly consis-\r\ntent with an intelligent “design of the statute” to give the\r\nNation’s chief law enforcement official, not its chief health\r\nofficial, broad discretion over the substantive standards\r\nthat govern registration and deregistration. That is espe-\r\ncially true where the contested “scientific and medical”\r\njudgment at issue has to do with the legitimacy of physi-\r\ncian-assisted suicide, which ultimately rests, not on “sci-\r\nence” or “medicine,” but on a naked value judgment. It no\r\nmore depends upon a “quintessentially medical judg-\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            23\r\n\r\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nmen[t],” ante, at 20, than does the legitimacy of polygamy\r\nor eugenic infanticide. And it requires no particular medi-\r\ncal training to undertake the objective inquiry into how\r\nthe continuing traditions of Western medicine have consis-\r\ntently treated this subject. See OLC Memo, App. to Pet.\r\nfor Cert. 113a–130a. The Secretary’s supposedly superior\r\n“medical expertise” to make “medical judgments,” ante, at\r\n19–20, is strikingly irrelevant to the case at hand.\r\n   The Court also reasons that, even if the CSA grants the\r\nAttorney General authority to interpret §823(f), the Direc-\r\ntive does not purport to exercise that authority, because it\r\n“does not undertake the five-factor analysis” of §823(f) and\r\ndoes not “on its face purport to be an application of the\r\nregistration provision in §823(f).” Ante, at 14 (emphasis\r\nadded). This reasoning is sophistic. It would be im-\r\nproper—indeed, impossible—for the Attorney General to\r\n“undertake the five-factor analysis” of §823(f) and to\r\n“appl[y] the registration provision” outside the context of\r\nan actual enforcement proceeding. But of course the\r\nAttorney General may issue regulations to clarify his\r\ninterpretation of the five factors, and to signal how he will\r\napply them in future enforcement proceedings. That is\r\nwhat the Directive plainly purports to do by citing\r\n§824(a)(4), and that is why the Directive’s conclusion on\r\nderegistration is couched in conditional terms: “Such\r\nconduct by a physician . . . may ‘render his registration . . .\r\ninconsistent with the public interest’ and therefore subject\r\nto possible suspension or revocation under 21 U. S. C.\r\n[§]824(a)(4).” 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (emphasis added).\r\n   It follows from what we have said that the Attorney\r\nGeneral’s authoritative interpretations of “public interest”\r\nand “public health and safety” in §823(f) are subject to\r\nChevron deference. As noted earlier, the Court does not\r\ncontest that the absence of notice-and-comment proce-\r\ndures for the Directive renders Chevron inapplicable. And\r\nthere is no serious argument that “Congress has directly\r\n24                  GONZALES v. OREGON\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nspoken to the precise question at issue,” or that the Direc-\r\ntive’s interpretations of “public health and safety” and\r\n“inconsistent with the public interest” are not “permissi-\r\nble.” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842–843. On the latter point,\r\nin fact, the condemnation of assisted suicide by 50 Ameri-\r\ncan jurisdictions supports the Attorney General’s view.\r\nThe Attorney General may therefore weigh a physician’s\r\nparticipation in assisted suicide as a factor counseling\r\nagainst his registration, or in favor of deregistration,\r\nunder §823(f).\r\n   In concluding to the contrary, the Court merely presents\r\nthe conclusory assertion that “it is doubtful the Attorney\r\nGeneral could cite the ‘public interest’ or ‘public health’ to\r\nderegister a physician simply because he deemed a contro-\r\nversial practice permitted by state law to have an illegiti-\r\nmate medical purpose.” Ante, at 17. But why on earth\r\nnot?—especially when he has interpreted the relevant\r\nstatutory factors in advance to give fair warning that such\r\na practice is “inconsistent with the public interest.” The\r\nAttorney General’s discretion to determine the public\r\ninterest in this area is admittedly broad—but certainly no\r\nbroader than other congressionally conferred Executive\r\npowers that we have upheld in the past. See, e.g., Na-\r\ntional Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U. S. 190,\r\n216–217 (1943) (“public interest”); New York Central\r\nSecurities Corp. v. United States, 287 U. S. 12, 24–25\r\n(1932) (same); see also Mistretta v. United States, 488\r\nU. S. 361, 415–416 (1989) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\r\n                       *    *      *\r\n  In sum, the Directive’s first conclusion—namely that\r\nphysician-assisted suicide is not a “legitimate medical\r\npurpose”—is supported both by the deference we owe to\r\nthe agency’s interpretation of its own regulations and by\r\nthe deference we owe to its interpretation of the statute.\r\nThe other two conclusions—(2) that prescribing controlled\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)          25\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ndrugs to assist suicide violates the CSA, and (3) that such\r\nconduct is also “inconsistent with the public interest”—are\r\ninevitable consequences of that first conclusion. Moreover,\r\nthe third conclusion, standing alone, is one that the Attor-\r\nney General is authorized to make.\r\n   The Court’s decision today is perhaps driven by a feeling\r\nthat the subject of assisted suicide is none of the Federal\r\nGovernment’s business. It is easy to sympathize with that\r\nposition. The prohibition or deterrence of assisted suicide\r\nis certainly not among the enumerated powers conferred\r\non the United States by the Constitution, and it is within\r\nthe realm of public morality (bonos mores) traditionally\r\naddressed by the so-called police power of the States. But\r\nthen, neither is prohibiting the recreational use of drugs\r\nor discouraging drug addiction among the enumerated\r\npowers. From an early time in our national history, the\r\nFederal Government has used its enumerated powers,\r\nsuch as its power to regulate interstate commerce, for the\r\npurpose of protecting public morality—for example, by\r\nbanning the interstate shipment of lottery tickets, or the\r\ninterstate transport of women for immoral purposes. See\r\nHoke v. United States, 227 U. S. 308, 321–323 (1913);\r\nLottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 356 (1903). Unless we are to\r\nrepudiate a long and well-established principle of our\r\njurisprudence, using the federal commerce power to pre-\r\nvent assisted suicide is unquestionably permissible. The\r\nquestion before us is not whether Congress can do this, or\r\neven whether Congress should do this; but simply whether\r\nCongress has done this in the CSA. I think there is no\r\ndoubt that it has. If the term “legitimate medical purpose”\r\nhas any meaning, it surely excludes the prescription of\r\ndrugs to produce death.\r\n   For the above reasons, I respectfully dissent from the\r\njudgment of the Court.\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U.

S. C. §801 et seq., to their purely intrastate possession\r\nof marijuana for medical use as authorized under Califor-\r\nnia law, a majority of this Court (a mere seven months\r\nago) determined that the CSA effectively invalidated\r\nCalifornia’s law because “the CSA is a comprehensive\r\nregulatory regime specifically designed to regulate which\r\ncontrolled substances can be utilized for medicinal pur-\r\nposes, and in what manner.” Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S.\r\n___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 24) (emphasis added). The ma-\r\njority employed unambiguous language, concluding that the\r\n“manner” in which controlled substances can be utilized “for\r\nmedicinal purposes” is one of the “core activities regulated\r\nby the CSA.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 25). And, it described\r\nthe CSA as “creating a comprehensive framework for regu-\r\nlating the production, distribution, and possession of . . .\r\n‘controlled substances,’ ” including those substances that\r\n“‘have a useful and legitimate medical purpose,’ ” in order to\r\n“foster the beneficial use of those medications” and “to\r\nprevent their misuse.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 21).\r\n   Today the majority beats a hasty retreat from these\r\nconclusions. Confronted with a regulation that broadly\r\nrequires all prescriptions to be issued for a “legitimate\r\n2                       GONZALES v.

S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 10, 24), the major-\r\nity rejects the Attorney General’s admittedly “at least\r\nreasonable,” ante, at 26, determination that administering\r\ncontrolled substances to facilitate a patient’s death is not a\r\n“ ‘legitimate medical purpose.’ ” The majority does so\r\nbased on its conclusion that the CSA is only concerned\r\nwith the regulation of “medical practice insofar as it bars\r\ndoctors from using their prescription-writing powers as a\r\nmeans to engage in illicit drug dealing and trafficking as\r\nconventionally understood.” Ante, at 23. In other words,\r\nin stark contrast to Raich’s broad conclusions about the\r\nscope of the CSA as it pertains to the medicinal use of\r\ncontrolled substances, today this Court concludes that the\r\nCSA is merely concerned with fighting “ ‘drug abuse’ ” and\r\nonly insofar as that abuse leads to “addiction or abnormal\r\neffects on the nervous system.”1 Ante, at 26.\r\n    The majority’s newfound understanding of the CSA as a\r\nstatute of limited reach is all the more puzzling because it\r\nrests upon constitutional principles that the majority of\r\nthe Court rejected in Raich. Notwithstanding the States’\r\n“ ‘traditional police powers to define the criminal law and\r\nto protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens,’ ”\r\n545 U. S., at ___, n. 38 (slip op., at 27, n. 38), the Raich\r\nmajority concluded that the CSA applied to the intrastate\r\npossession of marijuana for medicinal purposes authorized\r\nby California law because “Congress could have rationally”\r\nconcluded that such an application was necessary to the\r\n\r\n——————\r\n    1 Themajority does not expressly address whether the ingestion of a\r\nquantity of drugs that is sufficient to cause death has an “abnormal\r\neffec[t] on the nervous system,” ante, at 25, though it implicitly rejects\r\nsuch a conclusion.\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U.

Here, by contrast, the\r\nmajority’s restrictive interpretation of the CSA is based in\r\nno small part on “the structure and limitations of federal-\r\nism, which allow the States ‘ “great latitude under their\r\npolice powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives,\r\nlimbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.” ’ ” Ante, at\r\n23 (quoting Medtronic, Inc. v.

According to the\r\nmajority, these “background principles of our federal\r\nsystem . . . belie the notion that Congress would use . . . an\r\nobscure grant of authority to regulate areas traditionally\r\nsupervised by the States’ police power.” Ante, at 28.\r\n   Of course there is nothing “obscure” about the CSA’s\r\ngrant of authority to the Attorney General. Ante, p. ___\r\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). And, the Attorney General’s\r\nconclusion that the CSA prohibits the States from author-\r\nizing physician assisted suicide is admittedly “at least\r\nreasonable,” ante, at 26 (opinion of the Court), and is\r\ntherefore entitled to deference. Ante, at 6–7 (SCALIA, J.,\r\ndissenting). While the scope of the CSA and the Attorney\r\nGeneral’s power thereunder are sweeping, and perhaps\r\ntroubling, such expansive federal legislation and broad\r\ngrants of authority to administrative agencies are merely\r\nthe inevitable and inexorable consequence of this Court’s\r\nCommerce Clause and separation-of-powers jurispru-\r\ndence. See, e.g., Raich, supra; Whitman v. American\r\nTrucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.

OREGON\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nvance of such considerations was at its zenith in Raich,\r\nwhen we considered whether the CSA could be applied to\r\nthe intrastate possession of a controlled substance consis-\r\ntent with the limited federal powers enumerated by the\r\nConstitution. Such considerations have little, if any,\r\nrelevance where, as here, we are merely presented with a\r\nquestion of statutory interpretation, and not the extent of\r\nconstitutionally permissible federal power. This is par-\r\nticularly true where, as here, we are interpreting broad,\r\nstraightforward language within a statutory framework\r\nthat a majority of this Court has concluded is so compre-\r\nhensive that it necessarily nullifies the States’ “ ‘tradi-\r\ntional . . . powers . . . to protect the health, safety, and\r\nwelfare of their citizens.’ ”2 Raich, supra, at ___, n. 38 (slip\r\nop., at 27, n. 38). The Court’s reliance upon the constitu-\r\ntional principles that it rejected in Raich—albeit under\r\nthe guise of statutory interpretation—is perplexing to say\r\nthe least. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  2 Notably, respondents have not seriously pressed a constitutional\r\n\r\nclaim here, conceding at oral argument that their “point is not neces-\r\nsarily that [the CSA] would be unconstitutional.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 44.\r\nIn any event, to the extent respondents do present a constitutional\r\nclaim, they do so solely within the framework of Raich. Framed in this\r\nmanner, the claim must fail. The respondents in Raich were “local\r\ngrowers and users of state-authorized, medical marijuana,” who stood\r\n“outside the interstate drug market” and possessed “ ‘medicinal mari-\r\njuana . . . not intended for . . . the stream of commerce.’ ” 545 U. S., at\r\n___, ___, (slip op., at 5, 16) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Here, by contrast,\r\nthe respondent-physicians are active participants in the interstate\r\ncontrolled substances market, and the drugs they prescribe for assist-\r\ning suicide have likely traveled in interstate commerce. If the respon-\r\ndents in Raich could not sustain a constitutional claim, then a fortiori\r\nrespondents here cannot sustain one. Respondents’ acceptance of Raich\r\nforecloses their constitutional challenge.\r\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145693/", "sha1": "ce315ecdaddce2aa1452228d70ab11a6cde5368f", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2005-018", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:06:41"}
