Inderbitzin, Attorney Advisor, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C., Paul D. Clement, Solicitor, General Counsel of Record, Sue Ellen Wooldrigde, Assistant Attorney General, Edwin S. Kneedler, Deputy Solicitor General, Daryl Joseffer, Assistant to the Solicitor General, William B. Lazarus, Martin J. Lalonde, John A. Bryson, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for Respondents.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case presents the question whether administrative payment orders issued by the Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) for the purpose of assessing royalty underpayments on oil and gas leases fall within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a), which sets out a 6-year statute of limitations for Government contract actions. We hold that this provision does not apply to these administrative payment orders, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920(MLA) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease public-domain lands to private parties for the production of oil and gas. 41 Stat. 437, as amended, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 181 <i>et seq.</i> MLA lessees are obligated to pay a royalty of at least \"12.5 percent in amount or value of the production removed or sold from the lease.\" \u00a7 226(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>In 1982, Congress enacted the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act (FOGRMA), 96 Stat. 2447, as amended, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 <i>et seq.,</i> to address the concern that the \"system of accounting with respect to royalties and other payments due and owing on oil and gas produced from such lease sites [was] archaic and inadequate.\" \u00a7 1701(a)(2). FOGRMA ordered the Secretary of the Interior to \"audit and reconcile, to the extent practicable, all current and past lease accounts for leases of oil or gas and take appropriate actions to make additional collections or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*642</span> refunds as warranted.\" \u00a7 1711(c)(1). The Secretary, in turn, has assigned these duties to MMS. 30 CFR \u00a7 201.100 (2006).</p>\n<p>Under FOGRMA, lessees are responsible in the first instance for the accurate calculation and payment of royalties. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1712(a). MMS, in turn, is authorized to audit those payments to determine whether a royalty has been overpaid or underpaid. \u00a7\u00a7 1711(a) and (c); 30 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 206.150(c), 206.170(d). In the event that an audit suggests an underpayment, it is MMS'<sup>[1]</sup> practice to send the lessee a letter inquiring about the perceived deficiency. If, after reviewing the lessee's response, MMS concludes that the lessee owes additional royalties, MMS issues an order requiring payment of the amount due. Failure to comply with such an order carries a stiff penalty: \"Any person who\u0097 (1) knowingly or willfully fails to make any royalty payment by the date as specified by [an] order ... shall be liable for a penalty of up to $10,000 per violation for each day such violation continues.\" 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719(c). The Attorney General may enforce these orders in federal court. \u00a7 1722(a).</p>\n<p>An MMS payment order may be appealed, first to the Director of MMS and then to the Interior Board of Land Appeals or to an Assistant Secretary. 30 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 290.105, 290.108. While filing an appeal does not generally stay the payment order, \u00a7 218.50(c), MMS will usually suspend the order's effect after the lessee complies with applicable bonding or financial solvency requirements, \u00a7 243.8.</p>\n<p>Congress supplemented this scheme by enacting the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996 (FOGRSFA), 110 Stat. 1700, as amended, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 <i>et seq.</i> FOGRSFA adopted a prospective 7-year statute of limitations for any \"judicial proceeding or demand\" for royalties arising under a federal oil or gas lease. \u00a7 1724(b)(1). The parties agree that this provision applies both to judicial actions (\"judicial proceeding]\") and to MMS' administrative payment orders (\"demand[s]\") arising on or after September 1, 1996. <i>Ibid.</i> This provision does not, however, apply to judicial proceedings or demands arising from leases of Indian land or underpayments of royalties on pre-September 1, 1996, production. FOGRSFA \u00a7\u00a7 9, 11, 110 Stat. 1717, notes following 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701.</p>\n<p>There is no dispute that a lawsuit in court to recover royalties owed to the Government on pre-September 1, 1996, production is covered by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a), which sets out a general 6-year statute of limitations for Government contract actions. That section, which was enacted in 1966, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Subject to the provisions of section 2416 of this title, and except as otherwise provided by Congress, every <i>action for money damages</i> brought by the United States or an officer or agency thereof which is founded upon any contract express or implied in law or fact, shall be barred unless <i>the complaint</i> is filed within six years after the right of action accrues or within one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings required by contract or by law, whichever is later.\" (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p>Whether this general 6-year statute of limitations also governs MMS administrative payment orders concerning pre-September 1, 1996, production is the question that we must decide in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*643</span> B</h2>\n<p>Petitioner BP America Production Co. holds gas leases from the Federal Government for lands in New Mexico's San Juan Basin. BP's predecessor, Amoco Production Co., first entered into these leases nearly 50 years ago, and these leases require the payment of the minimum 12.5 percent royalty prescribed by 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226(b)(1)(A). For years, Amoco calculated the royalty as a percentage of the value of the gas as of the moment it was produced at the well. In 1996, MMS sent lessees a letter directing that royalties should be calculated based not on the value of the gas at the well, but on the value of the gas after it was treated to meet the quality requirements for introduction into the Nation's mainline pipelines.<sup>[2]</sup> Consistent with this guidance, MMS in 1997 ordered Amoco to pay additional royalties for the period from January 1989 through December 1996 in order to cover the difference between the value of the treated gas and its lesser value at the well.</p>\n<p>Amoco appealed the order, disputing MMS' interpretation of its royalty obligations and arguing that the payment order was in any event barred in part by the 6-year statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a). The Assistant Secretary of the Interior denied the appeal and ruled that the statute of limitations was inapplicable.</p>\n<p>Amoco, together with petitioner Atlantic Richfield Co., sought review in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which agreed with the Assistant Secretary that \u00a7 2415(a) did not govern the administrative order. <i>Amoco Production Co. v. Baca,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d 1, 21 (2003). The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, <i>Amoco Production Co. v. Watson,</i> 410 F.3d 722, 733 (2005), and we granted certiorari, 547 U.S. 1068, 126 S.Ct. 1768, 164 L.Ed.2d 515 (2006), in order to resolve the conflict between that decision and the contrary holding of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in <i>OXY USA, Inc. v. Babbitt,</i> 268 F.3d 1001, 1005 (2001) (en banc). We now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We start, of course, with the statutory text. <i>Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,</i> 511 U.S. 164, 173, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994). Unless otherwise defined, statutory terms are generally interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning. <i>Perrin v. United States,</i> 444 U.S. 37, 42, 100 S.Ct. 311, 62 L.Ed.2d 199 (1979). Read in this way, the text of \u00a7 2415(a) is quite clear.</p>\n<p>The statute of limitations imposed by \u00a7 2415(a) applies when the Government commences any \"action for money damages\" by filing a \"complaint\" to enforce a contract, and the statute runs from the point when \"the right of action accrues.\" The key terms in this provision\u0097\"action\" and \"complaint\"\u0097are ordinarily used in connection with judicial, not administrative, proceedings. In 1966, when \u00a7 2415(a) was enacted, a commonly used legal dictionary defined the term \"right of action\" as \"[t]he right to bring suit; a legal right to maintain an action,\" with \"suit\" meaning \"any proceeding ... in a court of justice.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1488, 1603 (4th ed.1951) (hereinafter Black's). Likewise, \"complaint\" was defined as \"the first or initiatory pleading on the part of the plaintiff <span class=\"star-pagination\">*644</span> in a civil action.\"<sup>[3]</sup><i>Id.,</i> at 356. See also <i>Unexcelled Chemical Corp. v. United States,</i> 345 U.S. 59, 66, 73 S.Ct. 580, 97 L.Ed. 821 (1953) (holding that filing a complaint, in the ordinary sense of the term, means filing a suit in court, not initiating an administrative proceeding: \"Commencement of an action by the filing of a complaint has too familiar a history ... for us to assume that Congress did not mean to use the words in their ordinary sense\"). The phrase \"action for money damages\" reinforces this reading because the term \"damages\" is generally used to mean \"pecuniary compensation or indemnity, which may be recovered <i>in the courts.</i>\" Black's 466 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Nothing in the language of \u00a7 2415(a) suggests that Congress intended these terms to apply more broadly to administrative proceedings. On the contrary, \u00a7 2415(a) distinguishes between judicial and administrative proceedings. Section 2415(a) provides that an \"action\" must commence \"within one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings.\" Thus, Congress knew how to identify administrative proceedings and manifestly had two separate concepts in mind when it enacted \u00a7 2415(a).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In an effort to show that the term \"action\" is commonly used to refer to administrative, as well as judicial, proceedings, petitioners have cited numerous statutes and regulations that, petitioners claim, document this usage.<sup>[5]</sup> These examples, however, actually undermine petitioners' argument, since none of them uses the term \"action\" standing alone to refer to administrative proceedings. Rather, each example includes a modifier of some sort, referring to an \"administrative action,\" a \"civil or administrative action,\" or \"administrative enforcement actions.\" This pattern of usage buttresses the point that the term \"action,\" standing alone, ordinarily refers to a judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p>Petitioners contend that their broader interpretation of the statutory term \"action\" is supported by the reference to \"<i>every</i> action for money damages\" founded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*645</span> upon \"<i>any</i> contract.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a) (emphasis added). But the broad terms \"every\" and \"any\" do not assist petitioners, as they do not broaden the ordinary meaning of the key term \"action.\"</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that their interpretation is supported by <i>Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air,</i> 478 U.S. 546, 106 S.Ct. 3088, 92 L.Ed.2d 439 (1986), and <i>West v. Gibson,</i> 527 U.S. 212, 119 S.Ct. 1906, 144 L.Ed.2d 196 (1999), but this reliance is misplaced. In <i>Delaware Valley Citizens' Council,</i> we construed the attorney's fee provision of the Clean Water Act (CWA), which authorizes a \"court, in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, [to] award costs of litigation ... to any party.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(d). We permitted the recovery of fees both for work done in court and in subsequent administrative proceedings. But the pertinent statutory provision in that case did not employ the key terms that appear in the statute at issue here. Specifically, the CWA provision referred to \"litigation,\" not to an \"action\" commenced by the filing of a \"complaint.\" Moreover, \"the work done by counsel [in the administrative phase of the case] was as necessary to the attainment of adequate relief... as was all of their earlier work in the courtroom ... obtaining the consent decree.\" 478 U.S., at 558, 106 S.Ct. 3088. And we expressly reserved judgment on the question \"whether an award of attorney's fees is appropriate ... when there is no connected court action in which fees are recoverable.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 560, n. 5, 106 S.Ct. 3088.</p>\n<p><i>West</i> helps petitioners even less. There, we considered whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) could order a federal agency to pay compensatory damages in an administrative proceeding. Section 717(b) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(b), authorized the EEOC to employ \"appropriate remedies,\" but did not specifically authorize damages, and \u00a7 717(c) authorized a subsequent court action against an employer agency, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c). In 1991, Congress added Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1977A(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(a)(1), which provided that \"[i]n an action brought by a complaining party under section 706 or 717 ... the complaining party may recover compensatory ... damages.\" In <i>West,</i> the respondent employee argued that the enactment of \u00a7 1981a(a)(1) showed that Congress did not consider compensatory damages to be \"appropriate remedies\" in an EEOC proceeding, as opposed to an action brought by an aggrieved employee. If Congress had wished to authorize the award of compensatory damages in an EEOC proceeding, the respondent employee reasoned, Congress would have so provided in \u00a7 1981a(a)(<i>l</i>), by expressly cross-referencing \u00a7 717(c). We rejected this argument, but in doing so we did not hold that an EEOC proceeding is an \"action\" under \u00a7 1981a(a)(1). Rather, we simply concluded that the EEOC's authorization under \u00a7 717(b) to award \"appropriate remedies\" was broad enough to encompass compensatory damages. 527 U.S., at 220-221, 119 S.Ct. 1906.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we are not persuaded by petitioners' argument that the term \"action\" in \u00a7 2415(a) applies to the administrative proceedings that follow the issuance of an MMS payment order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>We similarly reject petitioners' suggestion that an MMS letter or payment order constitutes a \"complaint\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2415(a). Petitioners point to examples of statutes and regulations that employ the term \"complaint\" in the administrative context. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 15 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*646</span> \u00a7 45(b) (requiring the Federal Trade Commission to serve a \"complaint\" on a party suspected of engaging in an unfair method of competition); 29 CFR \u00a7 102.15 (2006) (a \"complaint\" initiates unfair labor practice proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board). But the occasional use of the term to describe certain administrative filings does not alter its primary meaning, which concerns the initiation of \"a civil action.\" Black's 356. Moreover, even if the distinction between administrative and judicial proceedings is put aside, an MMS payment order lacks the essential attributes of a complaint. While a complaint is a filing that commences a proceeding that may in the end result in a legally binding order providing relief, an MMS payment order in and of itself imposes a legal obligation on the party to which it is issued. As noted, the failure to comply with such an order can result in fines of up to $10,000 a day. An MMS payment order, therefore, plays an entirely different role from that of a \"complaint.\"<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>To the extent that any doubts remain regarding the meaning of \u00a7 2415(a), they are erased by the rule that statutes of limitations are construed narrowly against the government. <i>E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Davis,</i> 264 U.S. 456, 44 S.Ct. 364, 68 L.Ed. 788 (1924). This canon is rooted in the traditional rule <i>quod nullum tempus occurrit regi</i>\u0097 time does not run against the King. <i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States,</i> 304 U.S. 126, 132, 58 S.Ct. 785, 82 L.Ed. 1224 (1938). A corollary of this rule is that when the sovereign elects to subject itself to a statute of limitations, the sovereign is given the benefit of the doubt if the scope of the statute is ambiguous.</p>\n<p><i>Bowers v. New York &amp; Albany Lighterage Co.,</i> 273 U.S. 346, 47 S.Ct. 389, 71 L.Ed. 676 (1927), cited by petitioners, is not to the contrary. There, as here, the issue was the scope of a statute of limitations. The provision in that case, however, provided that \"`[n]o suit or proceeding for the collection of any such taxes'\" shall commence more than five years after the filing of the return. <i>Id.,</i> at 348-349, 47 S.Ct. 389. The Government argued that the terms \"proceeding\" and \"suit\" were coterminous, and urged further that any ambiguity should be resolved in its favor.</p>\n<p>The Court recognized the canon, restating it much as we have above. <i>Id.,</i> at 349, 47 S.Ct. 389. But the Court concluded that the canon had no application in that case because the text of the relevant statute, unlike \u00a7 2415(a), applied clearly and separately to \"suits\" and \"proceedings,\" and the Court saw no reason to give these different terms the same meaning. <i>Id.,</i> at 349-350, 47 S.Ct. 389.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E</h2>\n<p>We come now to petitioners' argument that interpreting \u00a7 2415(a) as applying only to judicial actions would render subsection (i) of the same statute superfluous. Subsection (i) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The provisions of this section shall not prevent the United States or an officer or agency thereof from collecting any claim of the United States by means of administrative offset, in accordance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*647</span> with section 3716 of title 31.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(i).</blockquote>\n<p>An administrative offset is a mechanism by which the Government withholds payment of a debt that it owes another party in order to recoup a payment that this party owes the Government. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3701(a)(1). Thus, under subsection (i), the Government may recover a debt via an administrative offset even if the Government would be time barred under subsection (a) from pursuing the debt in court.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that, if \u00a7 2415(a) applies only to judicial proceedings and not to administrative proceedings, there is no need for \u00a7 2415(i)'s rule protecting a particular administrative mechanism (<i>i.e.,</i> an administrative offset) from the statute of limitations set out in subsection (a). Invoking the canon against reading a statute in a way that makes part of the statute redundant, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>TRW Inc. v. Andrews,</i> 534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001), petitioners contend that subsection (i) shows that subsection (a) was meant to apply to administrative, as well as judicial, proceedings. We disagree.</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals noted, subsection (i) was not enacted at the same time as subsection (a) but rather was added 16 years later by the Debt Collection Act of 1982. 96 Stat. 1749. This enactment followed a dispute between the Office of the Comptroller General of the United States, head of the agency then named the General Accounting Office (GAO), and the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) over whether an administrative offset could be used to recoup a debt where a judicial recoupment action was already time barred.</p>\n<p>In 1978, in response to a question from the United States Civil Service Commission, OLC opined that an administrative offset could not be used to recoup a debt as to which a judicial action was already time barred. OLC reached this conclusion not because it believed that \u00a7 2415(a) reached administrative proceedings generally,<sup>[7]</sup> but rather because of the particular purpose of an administrative offset. \"Where [a] debt has not been reduced to judgment,\" OLC stated, \"an administrative offset is merely a pre-judgment attachment device.\" Memorandum from John M. Harmon, Assistant Attorney General, OLC, to Alan K. Campbell, Chairman, U.S. Civil Service Commission Re: Effect of Statute of Limitations on Administrative Collection of United States Claims 3 (Sept. 29, 1978), Joint Lodging. OLC opined that a prejudgment attachment device such as this exists only to preserve funds to satisfy any judgment the creditor subsequently obtains. <i>Id.,</i> at 4 (citing cases). OLC therefore concluded that, where a lawsuit is already foreclosed by \u00a7 2415(a), an administrative offset that is the functional equivalent of a pretrial attachment is also unavailable. <i>Id.,</i> at 3.</p>\n<p>GAO disagreed. See <i>In re Collection of Debts\u0097Statute of Limitations on Administrative Setoff,</i> 58 Comp. Gen. 501, 504-505, 1979 WL 14962 (1979). In its view, the question was answered by</p>\n<blockquote>\"[t]he general rule ... that statutes of limitations applicable to suits for debts or money demands bar or run only against the remedy (the right to bring suit) to which they apply and do not discharge the debt or extinguish, or even impair, the right or obligation, either in law or in fact, and the creditor may avail himself of every other lawful means of realizing on the debt or obligation. See <i>Mascot Oil Co. v. United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*648</span> <i>States,</i> 70 Ct.Cl. 246, 42 F.2d 309 (1930), affirmed 282 U.S. 434, 51 S.Ct. 196, 75 L.Ed. 444; and 33 Comp. Gen. 66, 1953 WL 526 (1953). See also <i>Ready-Mix Concrete Co. v. United States,</i> 131 Ct.Cl. 204, 130 F.Supp. 390 (1955).\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That Congress had time barred the judicial remedy, GAO reasoned, imposed no limit on the administrative remedy.</p>\n<p>The OLC-GAO dispute reveals that, even under the interpretation of subsection (a)\u0097the one we are adopting\u0097that considers it applicable only to court proceedings, subsection (i) is not mere surplusage. It clarifies that administrative offsets are not covered by subsection (a) even if they are viewed as an adjunct of a court action.</p>\n<p>To accept petitioners' argument, on the other hand, we would have to hold either that \u00a7 2415(a) applied to administrative actions when it was enacted in 1966 or that it was extended to reach administrative actions when subsection (i) was added in 1982. The clear meaning of the text of \u00a7 2415(a), which has not been amended, refutes the first of these propositions, and accepting the latter would require us to conclude that in 1982 Congress elected to enlarge \u00a7 2415 to cover administrative proceedings by inserting text expressly excluding a single administrative vehicle from the statute's reach. It is entirely unrealistic to suggest that Congress would proceed by such an oblique and cryptic route.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Petitioners contend that interpreting \u00a7 2415(a) as applying only to judicial actions results in a statutory scheme with peculiarities that Congress could not have intended. For example, petitioners note that while they are required by statute to preserve their records regarding royalty obligations for only seven years, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1724(f), the interpretation of \u00a7 2415(a) adopted by the Court of Appeals permits MMS to issue payment orders that reach back much further.</p>\n<p>We are mindful of the fact that a statute should be read where possible as effecting a \"`symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,'\" <i>FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> 529 U.S. 120, 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000), but here petitioners' alternative interpretation of \u00a7 2415(a) would itself result in disharmony. For instance, under FOGRSFA, MMS payment orders regarding oil and gas leases are now prospectively subject to a 7-year statute of limitations except with respect to obligations arising out of leases of Indian land. Consequently, if we agreed with petitioners that \u00a7 2415(a) applies generally to administrative proceedings, payment orders relating to oil and gas royalties owed under leases of Indian land would be subject to a shorter (<i>i.e.,</i> 6-year) statute of limitations than similar payment orders relating to leases of other public-domain lands (which would be governed by FOGRSFA's new 7-year statute). Particularly in light of Congress' exhortation that the Secretary of the Interior \"aggressively carry out his trust responsibility in the administration of Indian oil and gas,\" 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701(a)(4), it seems unlikely that Congress intended to impose a shorter statute of limitations for payment orders regarding Indian lands.</p>\n<p>Petitioners contend, finally, that interpreting \u00a7 2415(a) as applying only to judicial actions would frustrate the statute's purposes of providing repose, ensuring that actions are brought while evidence is fresh, lightening recordkeeping burdens, and pressuring federal agencies to assert federal rights promptly. These are certainly cogent policy arguments, but they must be viewed in perspective.</p>\n<p>For one thing, petitioners overstate the scope of the problem, since Congress of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*649</span> course can enact and has enacted specific statutes of limitations to govern specific administrative actions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5205(a)(1) (statute of limitations for an administrative action to recover payments made to state governments for disaster or emergency assistance). Indeed, in 1996, FOGRSFA imposed just such a limitation prospectively on all non-Indian land, oil, and gas lease claims.</p>\n<p>Second, and more fundamentally, the consequences of interpreting \u00a7 2415(a) as limited to court actions must be considered in light of the traditional rule exempting proceedings brought by the sovereign from any time bar. There are always policy arguments against affording the sovereign this special treatment, and therefore in a case like this, where the issue is how far Congress meant to go when it enacted a statute of limitations applicable to the Government, arguing that an expansive interpretation would serve the general purposes of statutes of limitations is somewhat beside the point. The relevant inquiry, instead, is simply how far Congress meant to go when it enacted the statute of limitations in question. Here prior to the enactment of \u00a7 2415(a) in 1966, contract actions brought by the Government were not subject to any statute of limitations. See <i>Guaranty Trust Co.,</i> 304 U.S., at 132, 58 S.Ct. 785. Absent congressional action changing this rule, it remains the law, and the text of \u00a7 2415(a) betrays no intent to change this rule as it applies to administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p>In the final analysis, while we appreciate petitioners' arguments, they are insufficient to overcome the plain meaning of the statutory text. We therefore hold that the 6-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 2415(a) applies only to court actions and not to the administrative proceedings involved in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>The CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice BREYER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  MMS is not always the auditing body, as MMS may delegate its authority to the host State or an Indian tribe. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1732, 1735.</p>\n<p>[2]  MMS intended this letter to implement its regulations, which required lessees \"to place gas in marketable condition at no cost to the Federal Government unless otherwise provided in the lease agreement.\" 30 CFR \u00a7 206.152(i) (1996).</p>\n<p>[3]  These primary definitions have not changed in substance since 1966.

Argued October 4, 2006\u2014Decided December 11, 2006\nAfter the Interior Department\u2019s Minerals Management Service (MMS)\n  issued administrative orders assessing petitioners for royalty under\n  payments on gas leases they held on Government lands, petitioners\n  filed an administrative appeal, contending, inter alia, that the pro\n  ceedings were barred by 28 U. S. C. \u00a72415(a), which provides in rele\n  vant part: \u201c[E]very action for money damages brought by the United\n  States or an . . . agency thereof which is founded upon any contract\n  . . . , shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years af\n  ter the right of action accrues or within one year after final decisions\n  have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings.\u201d (Em\n  phasis added.) The Assistant Secretary of the Interior denied the ap\n  peals, ruling that \u00a72415(a) did not govern the administrative order.\n  The District Court agreed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\nHeld: Section 2415(a)\u2019s 6-year statute of limitations applies only to\n court actions, not to the administrative payment orders involved in\n this case. Pp. 5\u201316.\n    (a) Unless otherwise defined, statutory terms are generally inter\n preted in accordance with their ordinary meaning. Read in this way,\n \u00a72415(a)\u2019s text is quite clear: Its key terms\u2014\u201caction\u201d and \u201ccom\n plaint\u201d\u2014are ordinarily used in connection with judicial, not adminis\n trative, proceedings. See, e.g., Unexcelled Chem. Corp. v. United\n States, 345 U. S. 59, 66. The phrase \u201caction for money damages\u201d re\n inforces this reading because the term \u201cdamages\u201d is generally used to\n2             BP AMERICA PRODUCTION CO. v. BURTON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    mean pecuniary compensation or indemnity recovered in court.\n    Moreover, the fact that \u00a72415(a) distinguishes between judicial and\n    administrative proceedings by providing that an \u201caction\u201d must com\n    mence \u201cwithin one year after final decisions have been rendered in\n    applicable administrative proceedings\u201d shows that Congress knew\n    how to identify administrative proceedings and manifestly had two\n    separate concepts in mind when it enacted \u00a72415(a). Pp. 5\u20136.\n       (b) Petitioners\u2019 assertion that \u00a72415(a)\u2019s term \u201caction\u201d is commonly\n    used to refer to administrative, as well as judicial, proceedings, is not\n    persuasive. The numerous statutes and regulations cited to docu\n    ment this supposed usage actually undermine petitioners\u2019 argument,\n    since none of them uses the term \u201caction\u201d standing alone to refer to\n    administrative proceedings. Rather, each includes a modifier, refer\n    ring to an \u201cadministrative action,\u201d a \u201ccivil or administrative action,\u201d\n    or \u201cadministrative enforcement actions.\u201d Section 2415(a)\u2019s references\n    to \u201cevery action for money damages\u201d founded upon \u201cany contract\u201d\n    (emphasis added) do not assist petitioners, as they do not broaden the\n    ordinary meaning of the key term \u201caction.\u201d Pennsylvania v. Delaware\n    Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, and West v. Gib\n    son, 527 U. S. 212, distinguished. Pp. 6\u20139.\n       (c) Petitioners\u2019 suggestion that an MMS payment order constitutes\n    a \u201ccomplaint\u201d under \u00a72415(a) is also rejected. Their examples of\n    statutes and regulations employing the term \u201ccomplaint\u201d in the ad\n    ministrative context are unavailing, since such occasional usage of\n    the term does not alter its primary meaning, which concerns the ini\n    tiation of a civil action. Moreover, an MMS payment order lacks the\n    essential attributes of a complaint, which is a filing that commences\n    a proceeding that may result in a legally binding order providing re\n    lief. In contrast, an MMS order in and of itself imposes a legal obli\n    gation on the party to which it is issued. Given that the failure to\n    comply with such an order can result in fines of up to $10,000 a day,\n    see 30 U. S. C. \u00a71719(c), the order plays an entirely different role\n    from that of a \u201ccomplaint.\u201d Pp. 9\u201310.\n       (d) Any remaining doubts are erased by the canon that statutes of\n    limitations are construed narrowly against the government. This\n    canon is rooted in the traditional rule that time does not run against\n    the King. A corollary of this rule is that a sovereign that elects to\n    subject itself to a statute of limitations is given the benefit of the\n    doubt if the statute\u2019s scope is ambiguous. Bowers v. New York & Al\n    bany Lighterage Co., 273 U. S. 346, distinguished. Pp. 10\u201311.\n       (e) The Court disagrees with petitioners\u2019 argument that interpret\n    ing \u00a72415(a) as applying only to judicial actions renders \u00a72415(i)\u2014\n    which specifies that \u201c[t]he provisions of this section shall not prevent\n    the United States . . . from collecting any claim . . . by means of ad\n                     Cite as: 549 U.

To accept pe\n  titioners\u2019 argument, on the other hand, the Court would have to hold\n  either that \u00a72415(a) applied to administrative actions when it was\n  enacted in 1966 or that it was extended to reach administrative ac\n  tions when \u00a72415(i) was added in 1982. The clear meaning of\n  \u00a72415(a)\u2019s text, which has not been amended, refutes the first of\n  these propositions, and accepting the latter would require the unreal\n  istic conclusion that in 1982 Congress proceeded to enlarge \u00a72415 to\n  cover administrative proceedings by the oblique and cryptic route of\n  inserting text expressly excluding a single administrative vehicle\n  from the statute\u2019s reach. Pp. 11\u201314.\n     (f) Although interpreting \u00a72415(a) as applying only to judicial ac\n  tions may result in certain peculiarities, petitioners\u2019 alternative in\n  terpretation would itself result in disharmony. For instance, MMS\n  oil and gas lease payment orders are now prospectively subject to a 7\n  year statute of limitations except with respect to obligations arising\n  out of leases of Indian land. 30 U. S. C. \u00a71724(b)(1). Given the ex\n  hortation that the Interior Secretary \u201caggressively carry out his trust\n  responsibility in the administration of Indian oil and gas,\u201d\n  \u00a71701(a)(4), it seems unlikely that Congress intended to impose a\n  shorter, 6-year statute of limitations for payment orders regarding\n  Indian lands. Finally, while cogent, petitioners\u2019 policy arguments as\n  to why limiting \u00a72415(a) to judicial actions frustrates the statute\u2019s\n  purposes must be viewed in perspective. For example, because there\n  are always policy arguments against affording the sovereign special\n  treatment, the relevant inquiry in a case like this is simply how far\n  Congress meant to go when it enacted the statute of limitations in\n  question. Prior to \u00a72415(a)\u2019s enactment, Government contract ac\n  tions were not subject to any statute of limitations. See Guaranty\n  Trust Co. v. United States, 304 U. S. 126, 132. Absent congressional\n  action changing this rule, it remains the law, and \u00a72415(a) betrays no\n  intent to change the rule as it applies to administrative proceedings.\n  Pp. 14\u201316.\n410 F. 3d 722, affirmed.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Mem\nbers joined, except ROBERTS, C.

S. C. \u00a72415(a), which sets out a 6-year stat\nute of limitations for Government contract actions. We\nhold that this provision does not apply to these adminis\ntrative payment orders, and we therefore affirm.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (MLA) authorizes the\nSecretary of the Interior to lease public-domain lands to\nprivate parties for the production of oil and gas. 41 Stat.\n437, as amended, 30 U.

BURTON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe lease.\u201d \u00a7226(b)(1)(A).\n  In 1982, Congress enacted the Federal Oil and Gas\nRoyalty Management Act (FOGRMA), 96 Stat. 2447, as\namended, 30 U. S. C. \u00a71701 et seq., to address the concern\nthat the \u201csystem of accounting with respect to royalties\nand other payments due and owing on oil and gas pro\nduced from such lease sites [was] archaic and inadequate.\u201d\n\u00a71701(a)(2). FOGRMA ordered the Secretary of the Inte\nrior to \u201caudit and reconcile, to the extent practicable, all\ncurrent and past lease accounts for leases of oil or gas and\ntake appropriate actions to make additional collections or\nrefunds as warranted.\u201d \u00a71711(c)(1). The Secretary, in\nturn, has assigned these duties to the MMS. 30 CFR\n\u00a7201.100 (2006).\n  Under FOGRMA, lessees are responsible in the first\ninstance for the accurate calculation and payment of\nroyalties. 30 U. S. C. \u00a71712(a). MMS, in turn, is author\nized to audit those payments to determine whether a\nroyalty has been overpaid or underpaid. \u00a7\u00a71711(a) and (c);\n30 CFR \u00a7\u00a7206.150(c), 206.170(d). In the event that an\naudit suggests an underpayment, it is MMS\u2019 1 practice to\nsend the lessee a letter inquiring about the perceived\ndeficiency. If, after reviewing the lessee\u2019s response, MMS\nconcludes that the lessee owes additional royalties, MMS\nissues an order requiring payment of the amount due.\nFailure to comply with such an order carries a stiff pen\nalty: \u201cAny person who\u2014(1) knowingly or willfully fails to\nmake any royalty payment by the date as specified by [an]\norder . . . shall be liable for a penalty of up to $10,000 per\nviolation for each day such violation continues.\u201d 30\nU.

While filing an appeal does not generally stay\nthe payment order, \u00a7218.50(c), MMS will usually suspend\nthe order\u2019s effect after the lessee complies with applicable\nbonding or financial solvency requirements, \u00a7243.8.\n  Congress supplemented this scheme by enacting the\nFederal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness\nAct of 1996 (FOGRSFA), 110 Stat. 1700, as amended, 30\nU. S. C. \u00a71701 et seq. FOGRSFA adopted a prospective 7\nyear statute of limitations for any \u201cjudicial proceeding or\ndemand\u201d for royalties arising under a federal oil or gas\nlease. \u00a71724(b)(1). The parties agree that this provision\napplies both to judicial actions (\u201cjudicial proceeding[s]\u201d)\nand to MMS\u2019 administrative payment orders (\u201cdemand[s]\u201d)\narising on or after September 1, 1996.

This provi\nsion does not, however, apply to judicial proceedings or\ndemands arising from leases of Indian land or underpay\nments of royalties on pre-September 1, 1996, production.\nFOGRSFA \u00a7\u00a79, 11, 110 Stat. 1717, notes following 30\nU.

BP\u2019s predecessor, Amoco Production Co.,\nfirst entered into these leases nearly 50 years ago, and\nthese leases require the payment of the minimum 12.5\npercent royalty prescribed by 30 U. S. C. \u00a7226(b)(1)(A).\nFor years, Amoco calculated the royalty as a percentage of\nthe value of the gas as of the moment it was produced at\nthe well. In 1996, MMS sent lessees a letter directing that\nroyalties should be calculated based not on the value of\nthe gas at the well, but on the value of the gas after it was\ntreated to meet the quality requirements for introduction\ninto the Nation\u2019s mainline pipelines.2 Consistent with this\nguidance, MMS in 1997 ordered Amoco to pay additional\nroyalties for the period from January 1989 through De\ncember 1996 in order to cover the difference between the\nvalue of the treated gas and its lesser value at the well.\n   Amoco appealed the order, disputing MMS\u2019 interpreta\ntion of its royalty obligations and arguing that the pay\nment order was in any event barred in part by the 6-year\nstatute of limitations in 28 U. S. C. \u00a72415(a).

United States, 444\nU. S. 37, 42 (1979). Read in this way, the text of \u00a72415(a)\nis quite clear.\n   The statute of limitations imposed by \u00a72415(a) applies\nwhen the Government commences any \u201caction for money\ndamages\u201d by filing a \u201ccomplaint\u201d to enforce a contract, and\nthe statute runs from the point when \u201cthe right of action\naccrues.\u201d The key terms in this provision\u2014\u201caction\u201d and\n\u201ccomplaint\u201d\u2014are ordinarily used in connection with judi\ncial, not administrative, proceedings. In 1966, when\n\u00a72415(a) was enacted, a commonly used legal dictionary\ndefined the term \u201cright of action\u201d as \u201c[t]he right to bring\nsuit; a legal right to maintain an action,\u201d with \u201csuit\u201d\nmeaning \u201cany proceeding . . . in a court of justice.\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 1488, 1603 (4th ed. 1951) (hereinafter\nBlack\u2019s). Likewise, \u201ccomplaint\u201d was defined as \u201cthe first or\n6             BP AMERICA PRODUCTION CO. v.

United States, 345 U. S. 59, 66 (1953) (holding that\nfiling a complaint, in the ordinary sense of the term,\nmeans filing a suit in court, not initiating an administra\ntive proceeding; \u201cCommencement of an action by the filing\nof a complaint has too familiar a history . . . for us to\nassume that Congress did not mean to use the words in\ntheir ordinary sense\u201d). The phrase \u201caction for money\ndamages\u201d reinforces this reading because the term \u201cdam\nages\u201d is generally used to mean \u201cpecuniary compensation\nor indemnity, which may be recovered in the courts.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s 466 (emphasis added).\n   Nothing in the language of \u00a72415(a) suggests that Con\ngress intended these terms to apply more broadly to ad\nministrative proceedings. On the contrary, \u00a72415(a) dis\ntinguishes     between    judicial    and    administrative\nproceedings. Section 2415(a) provides that an \u201caction\u201d\nmust commence \u201cwithin one year after final decisions have\nbeen rendered in applicable administrative proceedings.\u201d\nThus, Congress knew how to identify administrative\nproceedings and manifestly had two separate concepts in\nmind when it enacted \u00a72415(a).4\n                             B\n  In an effort to show that the term \u201caction\u201d is commonly\nused to refer to administrative, as well as judicial, pro\nceedings, petitioners have cited numerous statutes and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Theseprimary definitions have not changed in substance since\n1966. Black\u2019s (8th ed. 2004) now defines \u201caction\u201d as \u201c[a] civil or crimi\nnal judicial proceeding\u201d and a \u201ccomplaint\u201d as \u201c[t]he initial pleading that\nstarts a civil action and states the basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction, the\nbasis for the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the demand for relief.\u201d Id., at 31, 303.\n   4 Moreover, it seems unlikely that Congress intended administrative\n\nproceedings to commence within one year after the conclusion of admin\nistrative proceedings.\n                      Cite as: 549 U.

But the\nbroad terms \u201cevery\u201d and \u201cany\u201d do not assist petitioners, as\nthey do not broaden the ordinary meaning of the key term\n\u201caction.\u201d\n  Petitioners argue that their interpretation is supported\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 See, e.g., 42 U.

S. 212 (1999), but this reliance is misplaced. In Dela\nware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council, we construed the attorney\u2019s\nfee provision of the Clean Water Act (CWA), which author\nizes a \u201ccourt, in issuing any final order in any action\nbrought pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, [to]\naward costs of litigation . . . to any party.\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a77604(d). We permitted the recovery of fees both for work\ndone in court and in subsequent administrative proceed\nings. But the pertinent statutory provision in that case\ndid not employ the key terms that appear in the statute at\nissue here. Specifically, the CWA provision referred to\n\u201clitigation,\u201d not to an \u201caction\u201d commenced by the filing of a\n\u201ccomplaint.\u201d Moreover, \u201cthe work done by counsel [in the\nadministrative phase of the case] was as necessary to the\nattainment of adequate relief . . . as was all of their earlier\nwork in the courtroom . . . obtaining the consent decree.\u201d\n478 U.

And we expressly reserved judgment on\nthe question \u201cwhether an award of attorney\u2019s fees is ap\npropriate . . . when there is no connected court action in\nwhich fees are recoverable.\u201d Id., at 560, n. 5.\n   West helps petitioners even less. There, we considered\nwhether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC) could order a federal agency to pay compensatory\ndamages in an administrative proceeding. Section 717(b)\nof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e\u201316(b), authorized the EEOC to employ \u201cappropri\nate remedies,\u201d but did not specifically authorize damages,\nand \u00a7717(c) authorized a subsequent court action against\nan employer agency, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u201316(c). In 1991,\nCongress added Rev. Stat. \u00a71977A(a)(1), 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71981a(a)(1), which provided that \u201c[i]n an action brought\nby a complaining party under section 706 or 717 . . . the\ncomplaining party may recover compensatory . . . dam\nages.\u201d In West, the defendant agency argued that the\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nenactment of \u00a71981a(a)(1) showed that Congress did not\nconsider compensatory damages to be \u201cappropriate reme\ndies\u201d in an EEOC proceeding, as opposed to an action\nbrought by an aggrieved employee. If Congress had\nwished to authorize the award of compensatory damages\nin an EEOC proceeding, the defendant agency reasoned,\nCongress would have so provided in \u00a71981a(a)(l), by ex\npressly cross-referencing \u00a7717(c). We rejected this argu\nment, but in doing so we did not hold that an EEOC pro\nceeding is an \u201caction\u201d under \u00a71981a(a)(1). Rather, we\nsimply concluded that the EEOC\u2019s authorization under\n\u00a7717(b) to award \u201cappropriate remedies\u201d was broad\nenough to encompass compensatory damages. 527 U. S.,\nat 220\u2013221.\n  For these reasons, we are not persuaded by petitioners\u2019\nargument that the term \u201caction\u201d in \u00a72415(a) applies to the\nadministrative proceedings that follow the issuance of an\nMMS payment order.\n                               C\n  We similarly reject petitioners\u2019 suggestion that an MMS\nletter or payment order constitutes a \u201ccomplaint\u201d within\nthe meaning of \u00a72415(a). Petitioners point to examples of\nstatutes and regulations that employ the term \u201ccomplaint\u201d\nin the administrative context. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C. \u00a745(b)\n(requiring the Federal Trade Commission to serve a \u201ccom\nplaint\u201d on a party suspected of engaging in an unfair\nmethod of competition); 29 CFR \u00a7102.15 (2006) (a \u201ccom\nplaint\u201d initiates unfair labor practice proceedings before\nthe National Labor Relations Board). But the occasional\nuse of the term to describe certain administrative filings\ndoes not alter its primary meaning, which concerns the\ninitiation of \u201ca civil action.\u201d Black\u2019s 356. Moreover, even\nif the distinction between administrative and judicial\nproceedings is put aside, an MMS payment order lacks the\nessential attributes of a complaint. While a complaint is a\n10          BP AMERICA PRODUCTION CO. v. BURTON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfiling that commences a proceeding that may in the end\nresult in a legally binding order providing relief, an MMS\npayment order in and of itself imposes a legal obligation\non the party to which it is issued. As noted, the failure to\ncomply with such an order can result in fines of up to\n$10,000 a day. An MMS payment order, therefore, plays\nan entirely different role from that of a \u201ccomplaint.\u201d6\n                               D\n   To the extent that any doubts remain regarding the\nmeaning of \u00a72415(a), they are erased by the rule that\nstatutes of limitations are construed narrowly against the\ngovernment. E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Davis, 264\nU. S. 456 (1924). This canon is rooted in the traditional\nrule quod nullum tempus occurrit regi\u2014time does not run\nagainst the King. Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States,\n304 U. S. 126, 132 (1938). A corollary of this rule is that\nwhen the sovereign elects to subject itself to a statute of\nlimitations, the sovereign is given the benefit of the doubt\nif the scope of the statute is ambiguous.\n   Bowers v. New York & Albany Lighterage Co., 273 U. S.\n346 (1927), cited by petitioners, is not to the contrary.\nThere, as here, the issue was the scope of a statute of\nlimitations. The provision in that case, however, provided\nthat \u201c \u2018[n]o suit or proceeding for the collection of any such\ntaxes\u2019 \u201d shall commence more than five years after the\nfiling of the return. Id., at 348\u2013349. The Government\nargued that the terms \u201cproceeding\u201d and \u201csuit\u201d were coter\nminous, and urged further that any ambiguity should be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 There  was some question at oral argument whether MMS\u2019 initial\nletter might constitute a \u201ccomplaint\u201d within the meaning of \u00a72415(a).\nPetitioners did not advance this argument, and recognized at oral\nargument that neither the statute nor the regulations require the\nissuance of such a letter. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\u20139. The Government, for its\npart, observed that all such a letter does is request information, as the\nagency has not yet decided whether to assert a claim. Id., at 28. This\nis not a complaint.\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresolved in its favor.\n  The Court recognized the canon, restating it much as we\nhave above. Id., at 349. But the Court concluded that the\ncanon had no application in that case because the text of\nthe relevant statute, unlike \u00a72415(a), applied clearly and\nseparately to \u201csuits\u201d and \u201cproceedings,\u201d and the Court saw\nno reason to give these different terms the same meaning.\nId., at 349\u2013350.\n                             E\n   We come now to petitioners\u2019 argument that interpreting\n\u00a72415(a) as applying only to judicial actions would render\nsubsection (i) of the same statute superfluous. Subsection\n(i) provides as follows:\n    \u201cThe provisions of this section shall not prevent the\n    United States or an officer or agency thereof from col\n    lecting any claim of the United States by means of\n    administrative offset, in accordance with section 3716\n    of title 31.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72415(i).\nAn administrative offset is a mechanism by which the\nGovernment withholds payment of a debt that it owes\nanother party in order to recoup a payment that this party\nowes the Government. 31 U. S. C. \u00a73701(a)(1). Thus,\nunder subsection (i), the Government may recover a debt\nvia an administrative offset even if the Government would\nbe time barred under subsection (a) from pursuing the\ndebt in court.\n  Petitioners argue that, if \u00a72415(a) applies only to judi\ncial proceedings and not to administrative proceedings,\nthere is no need for \u00a72415(i)\u2019s rule protecting a particular\nadministrative mechanism (i.e., an administrative offset)\nfrom the statute of limitations set out in subsection (a).\nInvoking the canon against reading a statute in a way that\nmakes part of the statute redundant, see, e.g., TRW Inc. v.\nAndrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001), petitioners contend that\n12            BP AMERICA PRODUCTION CO. v. BURTON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsubsection (i) shows that subsection (a) was meant to\napply to administrative, as well as judicial, proceedings.\nWe disagree.\n   As the Court of Appeals noted, subsection (i) was not\nenacted at the same time as subsection (a) but rather was\nadded 16 years later by the Debt Collection Act of 1982.\n96 Stat. 1749. This enactment followed a dispute between\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and\nthe Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC)\nover whether an administrative offset could be used to\nrecoup a debt where a judicial recoupment action was\nalready time barred.\n   In 1978, in response to a question from the United\nStates Civil Service Commission, OLC opined that an\nadministrative offset could not be used to recoup a debt as\nto which a judicial action was already time barred. OLC\nreached this conclusion not because it believed that\n\u00a72415(a) reached administrative proceedings generally,7\nbut rather because of the particular purpose of an admin\nistrative offset. \u201cWhere [a] debt has not been reduced to\njudgment,\u201d OLC stated, \u201can administrative offset is merely\na pre-judgment attachment device.\u201d Memorandum from\nJohn M. Harmon, Assistant Attorney General, OLC, to\nAlan K. Campbell, Chairman, U. S. Civil Service Commis\nsion Re: Effect of Statute of Limitations on Administrative\nCollection of United States Claims 3 (Sept. 29, 1978), Joint\nLodging. OLC opined that a prejudgment attachment\ndevice such as this exists only to preserve funds to satisfy\nany judgment the creditor subsequently obtains. Id., at 4\n(citing cases).

Nor\nhave petitioners pointed to any source demonstrating otherwise.\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

Id., at 3.\n   The OCC disagreed. See In the Matter of Collection of\nDebts\u2014Statute of Limitations on Administrative Setoff, 58\nComp. Gen. 501, 504\u2013505 (1979). In its view, the question\nwas answered by\n    \u201c[t]he general rule . . . that statutes of limitations ap\n    plicable to suits for debts or money demands bar or\n    run only against the remedy (the right to bring suit)\n    to which they apply and do not discharge the debt or\n    extinguish, or even impair, the right or obligation, ei\n    ther in law or in fact, and the creditor may avail him\n    self of every other lawful means of realizing on the\n    debt or obligation. See Mascot Oil Co. v. United\n    States, 42 F. 2d 309 (Ct. Cl. 1930), affirmed 282 U. S.\n    434; and 33 Comp. Gen. 66 (1953). See also Ready-\n    Mix Concrete Co. v. United States, 130 F. Supp. 390\n    (Ct. Cl. 1955).\u201d Ibid.\nThat Congress had time-barred the judicial remedy, OCC\nreasoned, imposed no limit on the administrative remedy.\n   The OLC\u2013OCC dispute reveals that, even under the\ninterpretation of subsection (a)\u2014the one we are adopt\ning\u2014that considers it applicable only to court proceedings,\nsubsection (i) is not mere surplusage. It clarifies that\nadministrative offsets are not covered by subsection (a)\neven if they are viewed as an adjunct of a court action.\n   To accept petitioners\u2019 argument, on the other hand, we\nwould have to hold either that \u00a72415(a) applied to admin\nistrative actions when it was enacted in 1966 or that it\nwas extended to reach administrative actions when sub\nsection (i) was added in 1982. The clear meaning of the\ntext of \u00a72415(a), which has not been amended, refutes the\nfirst of these propositions, and accepting the latter would\nrequire us to conclude that in 1982 Congress elected to\nenlarge \u00a72415 to cover administrative proceedings by\n14        BP AMERICA PRODUCTION CO. v. BURTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninserting text expressly excluding a single administrative\nvehicle from the statute\u2019s reach. It is entirely unrealistic\nto suggest that Congress would proceed by such an oblique\nand cryptic route.\n                              III\n   Petitioners contend that interpreting \u00a72415(a) as apply\ning only to judicial actions results in a statutory scheme\nwith peculiarities that Congress could not have intended.\nFor example, petitioners note that while they are required\nby statute to preserve their records regarding royalty\nobligations for only seven years, 30 U. S. C. \u00a71724(f), the\ninterpretation of \u00a72415(a) adopted by the Court of Appeals\npermits MMS to issue payment orders that reach back\nmuch farther.\n   We are mindful of the fact that a statute should be read\nwhere possible as effecting a \u201c \u2018symmetrical and coherent\nregulatory scheme,\u2019 \u201d FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco\nCorp., 529 U. S. 120, 133 (2000), but here petitioners\u2019\nalternative interpretation of \u00a72415(a) would itself result in\ndisharmony. For instance, under FOGRSFA, MMS pay\nment orders regarding oil and gas leases are now prospec\ntively subject to a 7-year statute of limitations except with\nrespect to obligations arising out of leases of Indian land.\nConsequently, if we agreed with petitioners that \u00a72415(a)\napplies generally to administrative proceedings, payment\norders relating to oil and gas royalties owed under leases\nof Indian land would be subject to a shorter (i.e., 6-year)\nstatute of limitations than similar payment orders relat\ning to leases of other public-domain lands (which would be\ngoverned by FOGRSFA\u2019s new 7-year statute). Particularly\nin light of Congress\u2019 exhortation that the Secretary of the\nInterior \u201caggressively carry out his trust responsibility in\nthe administration of Indian oil and gas,\u201d 30 U. S. C.\n\u00a71701(a)(4), it seems unlikely that Congress intended to\nimpose a shorter statute of limitations for payment orders\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)         15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nregarding Indian lands.\n   Petitioners contend, finally, that interpreting \u00a72415(a)\nas applying only to judicial actions would frustrate the\nstatute\u2019s purposes of providing repose, ensuring that\nactions are brought while evidence is fresh, lightening\nrecordkeeping burdens, and pressuring federal agencies to\nassert federal rights promptly. These are certainly cogent\npolicy arguments, but they must be viewed in perspective.\n   For one thing, petitioners overstate the scope of the\nproblem, since Congress of course can enact and has en\nacted specific statutes of limitations to govern specific\nadministrative actions. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a75205(a)(1)\n(statute of limitations for an administrative action to\nrecover payments made to state governments for disaster\nor emergency assistance). Indeed, in 1996, FOGRSFA\nimposed just such a limitation prospectively on all non-\nIndian land, oil, and gas lease claims.\n   Second, and more fundamentally, the consequences of\ninterpreting \u00a72415(a) as limited to court actions must be\nconsidered in light of the traditional rule exempting pro\nceedings brought by the sovereign from any time bar.\nThere are always policy arguments against affording the\nsovereign this special treatment, and therefore in a case\nlike this, where the issue is how far Congress meant to go\nwhen it enacted a statute of limitations applicable to the\nGovernment, arguing that an expansive interpretation\nwould serve the general purposes of statutes of limitations\nis somewhat beside the point. The relevant inquiry, in\nstead, is simply how far Congress meant to go when it\nenacted the statute of limitations in question. Here prior\nto the enactment of \u00a72415(a) in 1966, contract actions\nbrought by the Government were not subject to any stat\nute of limitations. See Guaranty Trust Co., 304 U. S., at\n132. Absent congressional action changing this rule, it\nremains the law, and the text of \u00a72415(a) betrays no intent\nto change this rule as it applies to administrative proceed\n16       BP AMERICA PRODUCTION CO. v. BURTON\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nings.\n  In the final analysis, while we appreciate petitioners\u2019\narguments, they are insufficient to overcome the plain\nmeaning of the statutory text. We therefore hold that the\n6-year statute of limitations in \u00a72415(a) applies only to\ncourt actions and not to the administrative proceedings\ninvolved in this case.\n                         *    *    *\n  For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed.\n\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE BREYER took no part\nin the consideration or decision of this case.\n",

Bryson, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for Respondents.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case presents the question whether administrative payment orders issued by the Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) for the purpose of assessing royalty underpayments on oil and gas leases fall within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a), which sets out a 6-year statute of limitations for Government contract actions. We hold that this provision does not apply to these administrative payment orders, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920(MLA) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease public-domain lands to private parties for the production of oil and gas. 41 Stat. 437, as amended, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 181 <i>et seq.</i> MLA lessees are obligated to pay a royalty of at least \"12.5 percent in amount or value of the production removed or sold from the lease.\" \u00a7 226(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>In 1982, Congress enacted the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act (FOGRMA), 96 Stat. 2447, as amended, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 <i>et seq.,</i> to address the concern that the \"system of accounting with respect to royalties and other payments due and owing on oil and gas produced from such lease sites [was] archaic and inadequate.\" \u00a7 1701(a)(2). FOGRMA ordered the Secretary of the Interior to \"audit and reconcile, to the extent practicable, all current and past lease accounts for leases of oil or gas and take appropriate actions to make additional collections or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*642</span> refunds as warranted.\" \u00a7 1711(c)(1). The Secretary, in turn, has assigned these duties to MMS. 30 CFR \u00a7 201.100 (2006).</p>\n<p>Under FOGRMA, lessees are responsible in the first instance for the accurate calculation and payment of royalties. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1712(a). MMS, in turn, is authorized to audit those payments to determine whether a royalty has been overpaid or underpaid. \u00a7\u00a7 1711(a) and (c); 30 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 206.150(c), 206.170(d). In the event that an audit suggests an underpayment, it is MMS'<sup>[1]</sup> practice to send the lessee a letter inquiring about the perceived deficiency. If, after reviewing the lessee's response, MMS concludes that the lessee owes additional royalties, MMS issues an order requiring payment of the amount due. Failure to comply with such an order carries a stiff penalty: \"Any person who\u0097 (1) knowingly or willfully fails to make any royalty payment by the date as specified by [an] order ... shall be liable for a penalty of up to $10,000 per violation for each day such violation continues.\" 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719(c). The Attorney General may enforce these orders in federal court. \u00a7 1722(a).</p>\n<p>An MMS payment order may be appealed, first to the Director of MMS and then to the Interior Board of Land Appeals or to an Assistant Secretary. 30 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 290.105, 290.108. While filing an appeal does not generally stay the payment order, \u00a7 218.50(c), MMS will usually suspend the order's effect after the lessee complies with applicable bonding or financial solvency requirements, \u00a7 243.8.</p>\n<p>Congress supplemented this scheme by enacting the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996 (FOGRSFA), 110 Stat. 1700, as amended, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 <i>et seq.</i> FOGRSFA adopted a prospective 7-year statute of limitations for any \"judicial proceeding or demand\" for royalties arising under a federal oil or gas lease. \u00a7 1724(b)(1). The parties agree that this provision applies both to judicial actions (\"judicial proceeding]\") and to MMS' administrative payment orders (\"demand[s]\") arising on or after September 1, 1996. <i>Ibid.</i> This provision does not, however, apply to judicial proceedings or demands arising from leases of Indian land or underpayments of royalties on pre-September 1, 1996, production. FOGRSFA \u00a7\u00a7 9, 11, 110 Stat. 1717, notes following 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701.</p>\n<p>There is no dispute that a lawsuit in court to recover royalties owed to the Government on pre-September 1, 1996, production is covered by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a), which sets out a general 6-year statute of limitations for Government contract actions. That section, which was enacted in 1966, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Subject to the provisions of section 2416 of this title, and except as otherwise provided by Congress, every <i>action for money damages</i> brought by the United States or an officer or agency thereof which is founded upon any contract express or implied in law or fact, shall be barred unless <i>the complaint</i> is filed within six years after the right of action accrues or within one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings required by contract or by law, whichever is later.\" (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p>Whether this general 6-year statute of limitations also governs MMS administrative payment orders concerning pre-September 1, 1996, production is the question that we must decide in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*643</span> B</h2>\n<p>Petitioner BP America Production Co. holds gas leases from the Federal Government for lands in New Mexico's San Juan Basin. BP's predecessor, Amoco Production Co., first entered into these leases nearly 50 years ago, and these leases require the payment of the minimum 12.5 percent royalty prescribed by 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226(b)(1)(A). For years, Amoco calculated the royalty as a percentage of the value of the gas as of the moment it was produced at the well. In 1996, MMS sent lessees a letter directing that royalties should be calculated based not on the value of the gas at the well, but on the value of the gas after it was treated to meet the quality requirements for introduction into the Nation's mainline pipelines.<sup>[2]</sup> Consistent with this guidance, MMS in 1997 ordered Amoco to pay additional royalties for the period from January 1989 through December 1996 in order to cover the difference between the value of the treated gas and its lesser value at the well.</p>\n<p>Amoco appealed the order, disputing MMS' interpretation of its royalty obligations and arguing that the payment order was in any event barred in part by the 6-year statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a). The Assistant Secretary of the Interior denied the appeal and ruled that the statute of limitations was inapplicable.</p>\n<p>Amoco, together with petitioner Atlantic Richfield Co., sought review in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which agreed with the Assistant Secretary that \u00a7 2415(a) did not govern the administrative order. <i>Amoco Production Co. v. Baca,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d 1, 21 (2003). The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, <i>Amoco Production Co. v. Watson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></span>, 733 (2005), and we granted certiorari, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></span>, 126 S.Ct. 1768, 164 L.Ed.2d 515 (2006), in order to resolve the conflict between that decision and the contrary holding of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in <i>OXY USA, Inc. v.

We now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We start, of course, with the statutory text. <i>Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117837\"><a href=\"/opinion/117837/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 173, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994). Unless otherwise defined, statutory terms are generally interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning. <i>Perrin v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110155\"><a href=\"/opinion/110155/perrin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 42, 100 S.Ct. 311, 62 L.Ed.2d 199 (1979). Read in this way, the text of \u00a7 2415(a) is quite clear.</p>\n<p>The statute of limitations imposed by \u00a7 2415(a) applies when the Government commences any \"action for money damages\" by filing a \"complaint\" to enforce a contract, and the statute runs from the point when \"the right of action accrues.\" The key terms in this provision\u0097\"action\" and \"complaint\"\u0097are ordinarily used in connection with judicial, not administrative, proceedings. In 1966, when \u00a7 2415(a) was enacted, a commonly used legal dictionary defined the term \"right of action\" as \"[t]he right to bring suit; a legal right to maintain an action,\" with \"suit\" meaning \"any proceeding ... in a court of justice.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1488, 1603 (4th ed.1951) (hereinafter Black's). Likewise, \"complaint\" was defined as \"the first or initiatory pleading on the part of the plaintiff <span class=\"star-pagination\">*644</span> in a civil action.\"<sup>[3]</sup><i>Id.,</i> at 356. See also <i>Unexcelled Chemical Corp. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105092\"><a href=\"/opinion/105092/unexcelled-chemical-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 66, 73 S.Ct. 580, 97 L.Ed. 821 (1953) (holding that filing a complaint, in the ordinary sense of the term, means filing a suit in court, not initiating an administrative proceeding: \"Commencement of an action by the filing of a complaint has too familiar a history ... for us to assume that Congress did not mean to use the words in their ordinary sense\"). The phrase \"action for money damages\" reinforces this reading because the term \"damages\" is generally used to mean \"pecuniary compensation or indemnity, which may be recovered <i>in the courts.</i>\" Black's 466 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Nothing in the language of \u00a7 2415(a) suggests that Congress intended these terms to apply more broadly to administrative proceedings. On the contrary, \u00a7 2415(a) distinguishes between judicial and administrative proceedings. Section 2415(a) provides that an \"action\" must commence \"within one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings.\" Thus, Congress knew how to identify administrative proceedings and manifestly had two separate concepts in mind when it enacted \u00a7 2415(a).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In an effort to show that the term \"action\" is commonly used to refer to administrative, as well as judicial, proceedings, petitioners have cited numerous statutes and regulations that, petitioners claim, document this usage.<sup>[5]</sup> These examples, however, actually undermine petitioners' argument, since none of them uses the term \"action\" standing alone to refer to administrative proceedings. Rather, each example includes a modifier of some sort, referring to an \"administrative action,\" a \"civil or administrative action,\" or \"administrative enforcement actions.\" This pattern of usage buttresses the point that the term \"action,\" standing alone, ordinarily refers to a judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p>Petitioners contend that their broader interpretation of the statutory term \"action\" is supported by the reference to \"<i>every</i> action for money damages\" founded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*645</span> upon \"<i>any</i> contract.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a) (emphasis added). But the broad terms \"every\" and \"any\" do not assist petitioners, as they do not broaden the ordinary meaning of the key term \"action.\"</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that their interpretation is supported by <i>Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111749\"><a href=\"/opinion/111749/pennsylvania-v-delaware-valley-citizens-council-fo/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. 3088, 92 L.Ed.2d 439 (1986), and <i>West v. Gibson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118305\"><a href=\"/opinion/118305/west-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 119 S.Ct. 1906, 144 L.Ed.2d 196 (1999), but this reliance is misplaced. In <i>Delaware Valley Citizens' Council,</i> we construed the attorney's fee provision of the Clean Water Act (CWA), which authorizes a \"court, in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, [to] award costs of litigation ... to any party.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(d). We permitted the recovery of fees both for work done in court and in subsequent administrative proceedings. But the pertinent statutory provision in that case did not employ the key terms that appear in the statute at issue here. Specifically, the CWA provision referred to \"litigation,\" not to an \"action\" commenced by the filing of a \"complaint.\" Moreover, \"the work done by counsel [in the administrative phase of the case] was as necessary to the attainment of adequate relief... as was all of their earlier work in the courtroom ... obtaining the consent decree.\" 478 U.S., at 558, 106 S.Ct. 3088. And we expressly reserved judgment on the question \"whether an award of attorney's fees is appropriate ... when there is no connected court action in which fees are recoverable.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 560, n. 5, 106 S.Ct. 3088.</p>\n<p><i>West</i> helps petitioners even less. There, we considered whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) could order a federal agency to pay compensatory damages in an administrative proceeding. Section 717(b) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(b), authorized the EEOC to employ \"appropriate remedies,\" but did not specifically authorize damages, and \u00a7 717(c) authorized a subsequent court action against an employer agency, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c). In 1991, Congress added Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1977A(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(a)(1), which provided that \"[i]n an action brought by a complaining party under section 706 or 717 ... the complaining party may recover compensatory ... damages.\" In <i>West,</i> the respondent employee argued that the enactment of \u00a7 1981a(a)(1) showed that Congress did not consider compensatory damages to be \"appropriate remedies\" in an EEOC proceeding, as opposed to an action brought by an aggrieved employee. If Congress had wished to authorize the award of compensatory damages in an EEOC proceeding, the respondent employee reasoned, Congress would have so provided in \u00a7 1981a(a)(<i>l</i>), by expressly cross-referencing \u00a7 717(c). We rejected this argument, but in doing so we did not hold that an EEOC proceeding is an \"action\" under \u00a7 1981a(a)(1). Rather, we simply concluded that the EEOC's authorization under \u00a7 717(b) to award \"appropriate remedies\" was broad enough to encompass compensatory damages. 527 U.S., at 220-221, 119 S.Ct. 1906.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we are not persuaded by petitioners' argument that the term \"action\" in \u00a7 2415(a) applies to the administrative proceedings that follow the issuance of an MMS payment order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>We similarly reject petitioners' suggestion that an MMS letter or payment order constitutes a \"complaint\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2415(a). Petitioners point to examples of statutes and regulations that employ the term \"complaint\" in the administrative context. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 15 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*646</span> \u00a7 45(b) (requiring the Federal Trade Commission to serve a \"complaint\" on a party suspected of engaging in an unfair method of competition); 29 CFR \u00a7 102.15 (2006) (a \"complaint\" initiates unfair labor practice proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board). But the occasional use of the term to describe certain administrative filings does not alter its primary meaning, which concerns the initiation of \"a civil action.\" Black's 356. Moreover, even if the distinction between administrative and judicial proceedings is put aside, an MMS payment order lacks the essential attributes of a complaint. While a complaint is a filing that commences a proceeding that may in the end result in a legally binding order providing relief, an MMS payment order in and of itself imposes a legal obligation on the party to which it is issued. As noted, the failure to comply with such an order can result in fines of up to $10,000 a day. An MMS payment order, therefore, plays an entirely different role from that of a \"complaint.\"<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>To the extent that any doubts remain regarding the meaning of \u00a7 2415(a), they are erased by the rule that statutes of limitations are construed narrowly against the government. <i>E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co. v.

This canon is rooted in the traditional rule <i>quod nullum tempus occurrit regi</i>\u0097 time does not run against the King. <i>Guaranty Trust Co. v.

A corollary of this rule is that when the sovereign elects to subject itself to a statute of limitations, the sovereign is given the benefit of the doubt if the scope of the statute is ambiguous.</p>\n<p><i>Bowers v. New York &amp; Albany Lighterage Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620764\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620764/bowers-v-new-york-albany-lighterage-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>, 47 S.Ct. 389, 71 L.Ed. 676 (1927), cited by petitioners, is not to the contrary. There, as here, the issue was the scope of a statute of limitations. The provision in that case, however, provided that \"`[n]o suit or proceeding for the collection of any such taxes'\" shall commence more than five years after the filing of the return. <i>Id.,</i> at 348-349, 47 S.Ct. 389. The Government argued that the terms \"proceeding\" and \"suit\" were coterminous, and urged further that any ambiguity should be resolved in its favor.</p>\n<p>The Court recognized the canon, restating it much as we have above. <i>Id.,</i> at 349, 47 S.Ct. 389. But the Court concluded that the canon had no application in that case because the text of the relevant statute, unlike \u00a7 2415(a), applied clearly and separately to \"suits\" and \"proceedings,\" and the Court saw no reason to give these different terms the same meaning. <i>Id.,</i> at 349-350, 47 S.Ct. 389.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E</h2>\n<p>We come now to petitioners' argument that interpreting \u00a7 2415(a) as applying only to judicial actions would render subsection (i) of the same statute superfluous. Subsection (i) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The provisions of this section shall not prevent the United States or an officer or agency thereof from collecting any claim of the United States by means of administrative offset, in accordance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*647</span> with section 3716 of title 31.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(i).</blockquote>\n<p>An administrative offset is a mechanism by which the Government withholds payment of a debt that it owes another party in order to recoup a payment that this party owes the Government. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3701(a)(1). Thus, under subsection (i), the Government may recover a debt via an administrative offset even if the Government would be time barred under subsection (a) from pursuing the debt in court.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that, if \u00a7 2415(a) applies only to judicial proceedings and not to administrative proceedings, there is no need for \u00a7 2415(i)'s rule protecting a particular administrative mechanism (<i>i.e.,</i> an administrative offset) from the statute of limitations set out in subsection (a). Invoking the canon against reading a statute in a way that makes part of the statute redundant, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>TRW Inc. v. Andrews,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118465\"><a href=\"/opinion/118465/trw-inc-v-andrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 31, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001), petitioners contend that subsection (i) shows that subsection (a) was meant to apply to administrative, as well as judicial, proceedings. We disagree.</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals noted, subsection (i) was not enacted at the same time as subsection (a) but rather was added 16 years later by the Debt Collection Act of 1982. 96 Stat. 1749. This enactment followed a dispute between the Office of the Comptroller General of the United States, head of the agency then named the General Accounting Office (GAO), and the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) over whether an administrative offset could be used to recoup a debt where a judicial recoupment action was already time barred.</p>\n<p>In 1978, in response to a question from the United States Civil Service Commission, OLC opined that an administrative offset could not be used to recoup a debt as to which a judicial action was already time barred. OLC reached this conclusion not because it believed that \u00a7 2415(a) reached administrative proceedings generally,<sup>[7]</sup> but rather because of the particular purpose of an administrative offset. \"Where [a] debt has not been reduced to judgment,\" OLC stated, \"an administrative offset is merely a pre-judgment attachment device.\" Memorandum from John M. Harmon, Assistant Attorney General, OLC, to Alan K. Campbell, Chairman, U.S. Civil Service Commission Re: Effect of Statute of Limitations on Administrative Collection of United States Claims 3 (Sept. 29, 1978), Joint Lodging. OLC opined that a prejudgment attachment device such as this exists only to preserve funds to satisfy any judgment the creditor subsequently obtains. <i>Id.,</i> at 4 (citing cases). OLC therefore concluded that, where a lawsuit is already foreclosed by \u00a7 2415(a), an administrative offset that is the functional equivalent of a pretrial attachment is also unavailable. <i>Id.,</i> at 3.</p>\n<p>GAO disagreed.

In its view, the question was answered by</p>\n<blockquote>\"[t]he general rule ... that statutes of limitations applicable to suits for debts or money demands bar or run only against the remedy (the right to bring suit) to which they apply and do not discharge the debt or extinguish, or even impair, the right or obligation, either in law or in fact, and the creditor may avail himself of every other lawful means of realizing on the debt or obligation.

United States,</i> 131 Ct.Cl. 204, 130 F.Supp. 390 (1955).\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That Congress had time barred the judicial remedy, GAO reasoned, imposed no limit on the administrative remedy.</p>\n<p>The OLC-GAO dispute reveals that, even under the interpretation of subsection (a)\u0097the one we are adopting\u0097that considers it applicable only to court proceedings, subsection (i) is not mere surplusage. It clarifies that administrative offsets are not covered by subsection (a) even if they are viewed as an adjunct of a court action.</p>\n<p>To accept petitioners' argument, on the other hand, we would have to hold either that \u00a7 2415(a) applied to administrative actions when it was enacted in 1966 or that it was extended to reach administrative actions when subsection (i) was added in 1982. The clear meaning of the text of \u00a7 2415(a), which has not been amended, refutes the first of these propositions, and accepting the latter would require us to conclude that in 1982 Congress elected to enlarge \u00a7 2415 to cover administrative proceedings by inserting text expressly excluding a single administrative vehicle from the statute's reach. It is entirely unrealistic to suggest that Congress would proceed by such an oblique and cryptic route.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Petitioners contend that interpreting \u00a7 2415(a) as applying only to judicial actions results in a statutory scheme with peculiarities that Congress could not have intended. For example, petitioners note that while they are required by statute to preserve their records regarding royalty obligations for only seven years, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1724(f), the interpretation of \u00a7 2415(a) adopted by the Court of Appeals permits MMS to issue payment orders that reach back much further.</p>\n<p>We are mindful of the fact that a statute should be read where possible as effecting a \"`symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,'\" <i>FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118347\"><a href=\"/opinion/118347/fda-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000), but here petitioners' alternative interpretation of \u00a7 2415(a) would itself result in disharmony. For instance, under FOGRSFA, MMS payment orders regarding oil and gas leases are now prospectively subject to a 7-year statute of limitations except with respect to obligations arising out of leases of Indian land. Consequently, if we agreed with petitioners that \u00a7 2415(a) applies generally to administrative proceedings, payment orders relating to oil and gas royalties owed under leases of Indian land would be subject to a shorter (<i>i.e.,</i> 6-year) statute of limitations than similar payment orders relating to leases of other public-domain lands (which would be governed by FOGRSFA's new 7-year statute). Particularly in light of Congress' exhortation that the Secretary of the Interior \"aggressively carry out his trust responsibility in the administration of Indian oil and gas,\" 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701(a)(4), it seems unlikely that Congress intended to impose a shorter statute of limitations for payment orders regarding Indian lands.</p>\n<p>Petitioners contend, finally, that interpreting \u00a7 2415(a) as applying only to judicial actions would frustrate the statute's purposes of providing repose, ensuring that actions are brought while evidence is fresh, lightening recordkeeping burdens, and pressuring federal agencies to assert federal rights promptly. These are certainly cogent policy arguments, but they must be viewed in perspective.</p>\n<p>For one thing, petitioners overstate the scope of the problem, since Congress of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*649</span> course can enact and has enacted specific statutes of limitations to govern specific administrative actions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5205(a)(1) (statute of limitations for an administrative action to recover payments made to state governments for disaster or emergency assistance). Indeed, in 1996, FOGRSFA imposed just such a limitation prospectively on all non-Indian land, oil, and gas lease claims.</p>\n<p>Second, and more fundamentally, the consequences of interpreting \u00a7 2415(a) as limited to court actions must be considered in light of the traditional rule exempting proceedings brought by the sovereign from any time bar. There are always policy arguments against affording the sovereign this special treatment, and therefore in a case like this, where the issue is how far Congress meant to go when it enacted a statute of limitations applicable to the Government, arguing that an expansive interpretation would serve the general purposes of statutes of limitations is somewhat beside the point. The relevant inquiry, instead, is simply how far Congress meant to go when it enacted the statute of limitations in question. Here prior to the enactment of \u00a7 2415(a) in 1966, contract actions brought by the Government were not subject to any statute of limitations. See <i>Guaranty Trust Co.,</i> 304 U.S., at 132, 58 S.Ct. 785. Absent congressional action changing this rule, it remains the law, and the text of \u00a7 2415(a) betrays no intent to change this rule as it applies to administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p>In the final analysis, while we appreciate petitioners' arguments, they are insufficient to overcome the plain meaning of the statutory text. We therefore hold that the 6-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 2415(a) applies only to court actions and not to the administrative proceedings involved in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>The CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice BREYER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  MMS is not always the auditing body, as MMS may delegate its authority to the host State or an Indian tribe. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1732, 1735.</p>\n<p>[2]  MMS intended this letter to implement its regulations, which required lessees \"to place gas in marketable condition at no cost to the Federal Government unless otherwise provided in the lease agreement.\" 30 CFR \u00a7 206.152(i) (1996).</p>\n<p>[3]  These primary definitions have not changed in substance since 1966. Black's (8th ed.2004) now defines \"action\" as \"[a] civil or criminal judicial proceeding\" and a \"complaint\" as \"[t]he initial pleading that starts a civil action and states the basis for the court's jurisdiction, the basis for the plaintiff's claim, and the demand for relief.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 31, 303.</p>\n<p>[4]  Moreover, it seems unlikely that Congress intended administrative proceedings to commence within one year after the conclusion of administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p>[5]  See, <i>e.g.,</i> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5205(a)(1) (statute of limitations for \"administrative action[s] to recover any payment[s] made to a State or local government for disaster or emergency assistance\"); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441a(b)(11)(G) (requiring Resolution Trust Corporation to maintain staff to assist with certain \"cases, civil claims, and administrative enforcement actions\"); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u(h)(9)(B) (Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provision noting that certain \"[f]inancial records . . . may be disclosed or used only in an administrative, civil, or criminal action\"). See also 7 CFR \u00a7 3018.400(c) (2006) (Department of Agriculture regulation regarding \"administrative action[s] for the imposition of a civil penalty\" for failure to file disclosure forms); 71 Fed.Reg. 7407 (2006) (to be codified in 12 CFR \u00a7 1412.2(<i>l</i>)(1)) (Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation regulation defining \"prohibited indemnification payment\" to include reimbursement for a civil money penalty of judgment resulting from any \"administrative or civil action\" instituted by the Farm Credit Administration); 10 CFR pt. 820, App. A, IX-b (2006) (\"Administrative actions, such as determination of award fees where [Department of Energy] contracts provide for such determinations, will be considered separately from any civil penalties that may be imposed under this Enforcement Policy\").</p>\n<p>[6]  There was some question at oral argument whether MMS' initial letter might constitute a \"complaint\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2415(a). Petitioners did not advance this argument, and recognized at oral argument that neither the statute nor the regulations require the issuance of such a letter. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7-9. The Government, for its part, observed that all such a letter does is request information, as the agency has not yet decided whether to assert a claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 28. This is not a complaint.</p>\n<p>[7]  Indeed, what emerges strikingly from OLC's 1978 opinion is that no one at the time\u0097 neither OLC nor GAO\u0097even contemplated that \u00a7 2415(a) applied to administrative procedures in the first instance. Nor have petitioners pointed to any source demonstrating otherwise.</p>\n\n</div>",
