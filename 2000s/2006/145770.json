Fermino, Counsel of Record, Attorney at Law, San Francisco, CA, for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This Court has recognized that certain courtroom practices are so inherently prejudicial that they deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <i>Estelle v. Williams,</i> 425 U.S. 501, 503-506, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976); <i>Holbrook v. Flynn,</i> 475 U.S. 560, 568, 106 S.Ct. 1340, 89 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986). In this case, a state court held that buttons displaying the victim's image worn by the victim's family during respondent's trial did not deny respondent his right to a fair trial. We must decide whether that holding was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as determined by this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). We hold that it was not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On May 13, 1994, respondent Mathew Musladin shot and killed Tom Studer outside the home of Musladin's estranged wife, Pamela. At trial, Musladin admitted that he killed Studer but argued that he did so in self-defense. A California jury rejected Musladin's self-defense argument and convicted him of first-degree murder and three related offenses.</p>\n<p>During Musladin's trial, several members of Studer's family sat in the front row of the spectators' gallery. On at least some of the trial's 14 days, some members of Studer's family wore buttons with a photo of Studer on them.<sup>[1]</sup> Prior to opening <span class=\"star-pagination\">*652</span> statements, Musladin's counsel moved the court to order the Studer family not to wear the buttons during the trial. The court denied the motion, stating that it saw \"no possible prejudice to the defendant.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a.</p>\n<p>Musladin appealed his conviction to the California Court of Appeal in 1997. He argued that the buttons deprived him of his Fourteenth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights. At the outset of its analysis, the Court of Appeal stated that Musladin had to show actual or inherent prejudice to succeed on his claim and cited <i>Flynn, supra,</i> at 570, 106 S.Ct. 1340, as providing the test for inherent prejudice. The Court of Appeal, quoting part of <i>Flynn's</i> test, made clear that it \"consider[ed] the wearing of photographs of victims in a courtroom to be an `impermissible factor coming into play,' the practice of which should be discouraged.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a (quoting <i>Flynn, supra,</i> at 570, 106 S.Ct. 1340). Nevertheless, the court concluded, again quoting <i>Flynn, supra,</i> at 571, 106 S.Ct. 1340, that the buttons had not \"branded defendant `with an unmistakable mark of guilt' in the eyes of the jurors\" because \"[t]he simple photograph of Tom Studer was unlikely to have been taken as a sign of anything other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of [a] family member.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the state appellate process, Musladin filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court pursuant to \u00a7 2254. In his application, Musladin argued that the buttons were inherently prejudicial and that the California Court of Appeal erred by holding that the Studers' wearing of the buttons did not deprive him of a fair trial. The District Court denied habeas relief but granted a certificate of appealability on the buttons issue.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for issuance of the writ, finding that under \u00a7 2254 the state court's decision \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" \u00a7 2254(d)(1). According to the Court of Appeals, this Court's decisions in <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> clearly established a rule of federal law applicable to Musladin's case. <i>Musladin v.</i> <i>Lamarque,</i> 427 F.3d 653, 656-658 (2005). Specifically, the Court of Appeals cited its own precedent in support of its conclusion that <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> clearly established the test for inherent prejudice applicable to spectators' courtroom conduct. 427 F.3d, at 657-658 (citing <i>Norris v. Risley,</i> 918 F.2d 828 (C.A.9 1990)). The Court of Appeals held that the state court's application of a test for inherent prejudice that differed from the one stated in <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> \"was contrary to clearly established federal law and constituted an unreasonable application of that law.\" 427 F.3d, at 659-660. The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc. 427 F.3d 647 (2005). We granted certiorari, 547 U.S. 1069, 126 S.Ct. 1769, 164 L.Ed.2d 515 (2006), and now vacate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1219:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State <span class=\"star-pagination\">*653</span> court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</blockquote>\n<p>In <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), we explained that \"clearly established Federal law\" in \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \"refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Therefore, federal habeas relief may be granted here if the California Court of Appeal's decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of this Court's applicable holdings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In <i>Estelle v. Williams</i> and <i>Flynn,</i> this Court addressed the effect of courtroom practices on defendants' fair-trial rights. In <i>Williams,</i> the Court considered \"whether an accused who is compelled to wear identifiable prison clothing at his trial by a jury is denied due process or equal protection of the laws.\" 425 U.S., at 502, 96 S.Ct. 1691. The Court stated that \"the State cannot, consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, compel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed in identifiable prison clothes,\" <i>id.,</i> at 512, 96 S.Ct. 1691, but held that the defendant in that case had waived any objection to being tried in prison clothes by failing to object at trial, <i>id.,</i> at 512-513, 96 S.Ct. 1691.</p>\n<p>In <i>Flynn,</i> the Court addressed whether seating \"four uniformed state troopers\" in the row of spectators' seats immediately behind the defendant at trial denied the defendant his right to a fair trial. 475 U.S., at 562, 106 S.Ct. 1340. The Court held that the presence of the troopers was not so inherently prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 571, 106 S.Ct. 1340. In reaching that holding, the Court stated that \"the question must be... whether `an unacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 570, 106 S.Ct. 1340 (quoting <i>Williams, supra,</i> at 505, 96 S.Ct. 1691).</p>\n<p>Both <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> dealt with government-sponsored practices: In <i>Williams,</i> the State compelled the defendant to stand trial in prison clothes, and in <i>Flynn,</i> the State seated the troopers immediately behind the defendant. Moreover, in both cases, this Court noted that some practices are so inherently prejudicial that they must be justified by an \"essential state\" policy or interest. <i>Williams, supra,</i> at 505, 96 S.Ct. 1691 (concluding that the practice \"further[ed] no essential state policy\"); <i>Flynn, supra,</i> at 568-569, 106 S.Ct. 1340 (holding that the practice was not of the sort that had to be justified by an \"essential state interest\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In contrast to state-sponsored courtroom practices, the effect on a defendant's fair-trial rights of the spectator conduct to which Musladin objects is an open question in our jurisprudence. This Court has never addressed a claim that such private-actor courtroom conduct was so inherently prejudicial that it deprived a defendant of a fair trial.<sup>[2]</sup> And although the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*654</span> Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice that applies to state conduct in <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn,</i> we have never applied that test to spectators' conduct. Indeed, part of the legal test of <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i>\u0097asking whether the practices furthered an essential <i>state</i> interest\u0097suggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices.</p>\n<p>Reflecting the lack of guidance from this Court, lower courts have diverged widely in their treatment of defendants' spectator-conduct claims. Some courts have applied <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> to spectators' conduct. <i>Norris v. Risley,</i> 918 F.2d, at 830-831 (applying <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> to hold spectators' buttons worn during a trial deprived the defendant of a fair trial); <i>In re Woods,</i> 154 Wash.2d 400, 416-418, 114 P.3d 607, 616-617 (2005) (applying <i>Flynn</i> but concluding that ribbons worn by spectators did not prejudice the defendant). Other courts have declined to extend <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> to spectators' conduct. <i>Billings v. Polk,</i> 441 F.3d 238, 246-247 (C.A.4 2006) (\"These precedents do not clearly establish that a defendant's right to a fair jury trial is violated whenever an article of clothing worn at trial arguably conveys a message about the matter before the jury\"); <i>Davis v. State,</i> 223 S.W.3d 466, 474-475, 2006 WL 1211091, *6-*7 (Tex.App.2006) (\"Appellant does not cite any authority holding the display of this type of item by spectators creates inherent prejudice\"). Other courts have distinguished <i>Flynn</i> on the facts. <i>Pachl v. Zenon,</i> 145 Or.App. 350, 360, n. 1, 929 P.2d 1088, 1093-1094, n. 1 (1996) (in banc). And still other courts have ruled on spectator-conduct claims without relying on, discussing, or distinguishing <i>Williams</i> or <i>Flynn. Buckner v. State,</i> 714 So.2d 384, 388-389 (Fla.1998) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>State v. Speed,</i> 265 Kan. 26, 47-48, 961 P.2d 13, 29-30 (1998); <i>Nguyen v. State,</i> 977 S.W.2d 450, 457 (Tex.App.1998); <i>Kenyon v. State,</i> 58 Ark.App. 24, 33-35, 946 S.W.2d 705, 710-711 (1997); <i>State v. Nelson,</i> 96-0883, pp. 9-10 (La.App. 12/17/97), 705 So.2d 758, 763.</p>\n<p>Given the lack of holdings from this Court regarding the potentially prejudicial effect of spectators' courtroom conduct of the kind involved here, it cannot be said that the state court \"unreasonably] applied] clearly established Federal law.\" \u00a7 2254(d)(1). No holding of this Court required the California Court of Appeal to apply the test of <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> to the spectators' conduct here. Therefore, the state court's decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals improperly concluded that the California Court of Appeal's decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by this Court. For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>In <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*655</span> this Court issued two opinions announcing two separate holdings. In Part II-B of Justice O'Connor's opinion, the Court held that an incorrect application of federal law was not necessarily an \"`unreasonable application of ... clearly established Federal law'\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). 529 U.S., at 409-413, 120 S.Ct. 1495. In Parts III and IV of my opinion, in which Justice O'Connor joined, the Court held that the Virginia Supreme Court's rejection of the petitioner's claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel was both contrary to and an unreasonable application of law as determined by our earlier opinion in <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S., at 390-398, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p>In <i>Strickland,</i> we held that the petitioner had not been denied the effective assistance of counsel and upheld his sentence of death. 466 U.S., at 700, 104 S.Ct. 2052. While our ultimate <i>holding</i> rejected the petitioner's ineffective-assistance claim, the reasoning in our opinion (including carefully considered <i>dicta</i>) set forth the standards for evaluating such claims that have been accepted as \"clearly established law\" for over 20 years. See <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S., at 391, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Nevertheless, in a somewhat ironic dictum in her <i>Williams</i> opinion, Justice O'Connor stated that the statutory phrase \"clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" refers to \"the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495. That dictum has been repeated in three subsequent opinions in which a bare majority of the Court rejected constitutional claims that four of us would have upheld.<sup>[*]</sup> Because I am persuaded that Justice O'Connor's dictum about dicta represents an incorrect interpretation of the statute's text, and because its repetition today is wholly unnecessary, I do not join the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>Virtually every one of the Court's opinions announcing a new application of a constitutional principle contains some explanatory language that is intended to provide guidance to lawyers and judges in future cases. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004); <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); see also <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). It is quite wrong to invite state-court judges to discount the importance of such guidance on the ground that it may not have been strictly necessary as an explanation of the Court's specific holding in the case. Cf. <i>County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,</i> 492 U.S. 573, 668, 109 S.Ct. 3086, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (\"As a general rule, the principle of <i>stare decisis</i> directs us to adhere not only to the holdings of our prior cases, but also their explications of the governing rules of law\"); <i>Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC,</i> 478 U.S. 421, 490, 106 S.Ct. 3019, 92 L.Ed.2d 344 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"Although technically dicta, ... an important part of the Court's rationale for the result that it reache[s] is entitled to greater weight ...\"). The text of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 itself provides sufficient obstacles to obtaining habeas relief without placing a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*656</span> judicial thumb on the warden's side of the scales.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, my reasons for joining the Court's judgment in this case are essentially the same as those expressed by Justice SOUTER, with one caveat. In my opinion, there is no merit whatsoever to the suggestion that the First Amendment may provide some measure of protection to spectators in a courtroom who engage in actual or symbolic speech to express any point of view about an ongoing proceeding.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Trials must be free from a coercive or intimidating atmosphere. This fundamental principle of due process is well established. It was recognized in <i>Frank v. Mangum,</i> 237 U.S. 309, 35 S.Ct. 582, 59 L.Ed. 969 (1915), though the Court credited the determination of the state court and granted no relief; and it was the square holding in <i>Moore v. Dempsey,</i> 261 U.S. 86, 43 S.Ct. 265, 67 L.Ed. 543 (1923), though the Court remanded for factfinding rather than for a new trial. The disruptive presence of the press required reversal in <i>Sheppard v. Maxwell,</i> 384 U.S. 333, 355, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966), where \"newsmen took over practically the entire courtroom, hounding most of the participants in the trial,\" and <i>Estes v. Texas,</i> 381 U.S. 532, 550, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965), where the presence of cameras distracted jurors throughout the proceedings.</p>\n<p>The rule against a coercive or intimidating atmosphere at trial exists because \"we are committed to a government of laws and not of men,\" under which it is \"of the utmost importance that the administration of justice be absolutely fair and orderly,\" and \"[t]he constitutional safeguards relating to the integrity of the criminal process attend every stage of a criminal proceeding... culminating with a trial `in a court-room presided over by a judge.'\" <i>Cox v. Louisiana,</i> 379 U.S. 559, 562, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965) (quoting <i>Rideau v. Louisiana,</i> 373 U.S. 723, 727, 83 S.Ct. 1417, 10 L.Ed.2d 663 (1963)); (finding a statute did not on its face violate First Amendment rights where it prohibited picketing in courthouses). Cf. <i>Wood v. Georgia,</i> 370 U.S. 375, 82 S.Ct. 1364, 8 L.Ed.2d 569 (1962); <i>Turner v. Louisiana,</i> 379 U.S. 466, 85 S.Ct. 546, 13 L.Ed.2d 424 (1965).</p>\n<p>The rule settled by these cases requires a court, on either direct or collateral review, to order a new trial when a defendant shows his conviction has been obtained in a trial tainted by an atmosphere of coercion or intimidation similar to that documented in the foregoing cases. This would seem to be true whether the pressures were from partisans, or, as seems to have been the case in <i>Sheppard,</i> from persons reacting to the drama of the moment who created an environment so raucous that calm deliberation by the judge or jury was likely compromised in a serious way. If, in a given case, intimidation of this nature was brought about by the wearing of buttons, relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) would likely be available even in the absence of a Supreme Court case addressing the wearing of buttons. While general rules tend to accord courts \"more leeway ... in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations,\" <i>Yarborough v. Alvarado,</i> 541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004), AEDPA does not require state and federal courts to wait for some nearly identical factual pattern before a legal rule must be applied, cf. <i>Wright v. West,</i> 505 U.S. 277, 308-309, 112 S.Ct. 2482, 120 L.Ed.2d 225 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*657</span> (1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>In the case before us there is no indication the atmosphere at respondent's trial was one of coercion or intimidation to the severe extent demonstrated in the cases just discussed. The instant case does present the issue whether as a preventative measure, or as a general rule to preserve the calm and dignity of a court, buttons proclaiming a message relevant to the case ought to be prohibited as a matter of course. That rule has not been clearly established by our cases to date. It may be that trial judges as a general practice already take careful measures to preserve the decorum of courtrooms, thereby accounting for the lack of guiding precedents on this subject.</p>\n<p>In all events, it seems to me the case as presented to us here does call for a new rule, perhaps justified as much as a preventative measure as by the urgent needs of the situation. That rule should be explored in the court system, and then established in this Court before it can be grounds for relief in the procedural posture of this case.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>In this habeas proceeding, a federal court may not set aside the state judgment sustaining Musladin's conviction without finding it contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). While the ground between criteria entailed by \"clearly established\" and \"unreasonable application\" may be murky, it makes sense to regard the standard governing this case as clearly established by this Court. We have a number of decisions dealing with threats to the fundamental fairness of a criminal trial posed by conditions in (or originating in) the courtroom, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Holbrook v. Flynn,</i> 475 U.S. 560, 106 S.Ct. 1340, 89 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986); <i>Estelle v. Williams,</i> 425 U.S. 501, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976); <i>Sheppard v. Maxwell,</i> 384 U.S. 333, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966); <i>Estes v. Texas,</i> 381 U.S. 532, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965), and the two most recent ones agree on a general formulation harking back to <i>Estes, id.,</i> at 542-546, 85 S.Ct. 1628: the question is whether the practice or condition presents \"`an unacceptable risk ... of impermissible factors coming into play'\" in the jury's consideration of the case. <i>Flynn, supra,</i> at 570, 106 S.Ct. 1340 (quoting <i>Williams, supra,</i> at 505, 96 S.Ct. 1691). The Court's intent to adopt a standard at this general and comprehensive level could not be much clearer.</p>\n<p>As for the applicability of this standard, there is no serious question that it reaches the behavior of spectators. The focus of the later cases is on appearances within the courtroom open to the jurors' observation. There is no suggestion in the opinions, and no reason to think now, that it should matter whether the State or an individual may be to blame for some objectionable sight; either way, the trial judge has an affirmative obligation to control the courtroom and keep it free of improper influence. <i>Sheppard, supra,</i> at 363, 86 S.Ct. 1507. And since the <i>Williams-Flynn</i> standard is a guide for trial judges, not for laypersons without schooling in threats to the fairness of trials, its general formulation is enough to tell trial judges that it applies to the behavior of courtroom visitors.</p>\n<p>Nor is there any reasonable doubt about the pertinence of the standard to the practice in question; one could not seriously deny that allowing spectators at a criminal trial to wear visible buttons with the victim's photo can raise a risk of improper considerations. The display is no part of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*658</span> the evidence going to guilt or innocence, and the buttons are at once an appeal for sympathy for the victim (and perhaps for those who wear the buttons) and a call for some response from those who see them. On the jurors' part, that expected response could well seem to be a verdict of guilty, and a sympathetic urge to assuage the grief or rage of survivors with a conviction would be the paradigm of improper consideration.</p>\n<p>The only debatable question is whether the risk in a given case reaches the \"unacceptable\" level. While there is a fair argument that any level of risk from wearing buttons in a courtroom is unacceptable, two considerations keep me from concluding that the state court acted unreasonably in failing to see the issue this way and reverse the conviction. First, of the several courts that have considered the influence of spectators' buttons, the majority have left convictions standing. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>State v. Speed,</i> 265 Kan. 26, 47-48, 961 P.2d 13, 29-30 (1998); <i>State v. Braxton,</i> 344 N.C. 702, 709-710, 477 S.E.2d 172, 176-177 (1996); <i>State v. Lord,</i> 128 Wash. App. 216, 219-223, 114 P.3d 1241, 1243-1245 (2005); <i>Nguyen v. State,</i> 977 S.W.2d 450, 457 (Tex.App.1998). I am wary of assuming that every trial and reviewing judge in those cases was unreasonable as well as mistaken in failing to embrace a no-risk standard, and so I would find it hard to say the state judges were unreasonable in this case, given the lack of detail about the buttons' display. Second, an interest in protected expression on the part of the spectators wearing mourners' buttons has been raised, but not given focus or careful attention in this or any other case that has come to our notice. Although I do not find such a First Amendment interest intuitively strong here, in the absence of developed argument it would be preferable not to decide whether protection of speech could require acceptance of some risk raised by spectators' buttons.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I think Musladin has not shown the state judge's application of our law to be unreasonable, and on that ground concur in the Court's judgment.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The record contains little concrete information about the buttons. The buttons were apparently two to four inches in diameter and displayed only a photograph of Studer. It is not clear how many family members wore the buttons or how many days of the trial they wore them.</p>\n<p>[2]  This Court has considered cases in which the proceedings were a sham or were mob dominated. See <i>Moore v. Dempsey,</i> 261 U.S. 86, 91, 43 S.Ct. 265, 67 L.Ed. 543 (1923) (describing allegations that \"the whole proceeding [was] a mask\u0097that counsel, jury and judge were swept to the fatal end by an irresistible wave of public passion, and that the State Courts failed to correct the wrong\"); <i>Frank v. Mangum,</i> 237 U.S. 309, 324-325, 35 S.Ct. 582, 59 L.Ed. 969 (1915) (\"[T]he disorder in and about the court-room during the trial and up to and at the reception of the verdict amounted to mob domination, that not only the jury but the presiding judge succumbed to it\").</p>\n<p>[*]  See <i>Yarborough v.

Argued October 11, 2006\u2014Decided December 11, 2006\nAt respondent Musladin\u2019s murder trial, members of the victim\u2019s family\n  sat in the front row of the spectators\u2019 gallery wearing buttons dis\n  playing the victim\u2019s image. The trial court denied Musladin\u2019s motion\n  to order the family members not to wear the buttons. The California\n  Court of Appeal upheld Musladin\u2019s conviction, stating that he had to\n  show actual or inherent prejudice to succeed on the buttons claim;\n  citing Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560, as providing the test for in\n  herent prejudice; and ruling that he had not satisfied that test.

Pp. 3\u20134.\n    (b) This Court addressed the effect of courtroom practices on defen\n dants\u2019 fair-trial rights in Williams, in which the State compelled the\n defendant to stand trial in prison clothes, and Flynn, in which the\n State seated uniformed state troopers in the row of spectators\u2019 seats\n immediately behind the defendant at trial. In both cases, which dealt\n2                          CAREY v.

E.g., Williams, supra, at 505.\n    Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (c) In contrast to state-sponsored courtroom practices, the effect on\n    a defendant\u2019s fair-trial rights of the spectator conduct to which\n    Musladin objects is an open question in this Court\u2019s jurisprudence.\n    The Court has never addressed a claim that such private-actor court\n    room conduct was so inherently prejudicial that it deprived a defen\n    dant of a fair trial or applied the test for inherent prejudice in Wil\n    liams and Flynn to spectators\u2019 conduct. Indeed, part of that test\u2014\n    asking whether the practices furthered an essential state interest\u2014\n    suggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices. Re\n    flecting the lack of guidance from this Court, lower courts have di\n    verged widely in their treatment of defendants\u2019 spectator-conduct\n    claims.

Estelle v. Williams, 425 U. S.\n501, 503\u2013506 (1976); Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560, 568\n(1986). In this case, a state court held that buttons dis\nplaying the victim\u2019s image worn by the victim\u2019s family\nduring respondent\u2019s trial did not deny respondent his right\nto a fair trial. We must decide whether that holding was\ncontrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly es\ntablished federal law, as determined by this Court. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). We hold that it was not.\n                            I\n  On May 13, 1994, respondent Mathew Musladin shot\nand killed Tom Studer outside the home of Musladin\u2019s\nestranged wife, Pamela. At trial, Musladin admitted that\nhe killed Studer but argued that he did so in self-defense.\nA California jury rejected Musladin\u2019s self-defense argu\nment and convicted him of first-degree murder and three\nrelated offenses.\n  During Musladin\u2019s trial, several members of Studer\u2019s\n2                      CAREY v. MUSLADIN\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nfamily sat in the front row of the spectators\u2019 gallery. On at\nleast some of the trial\u2019s 14 days, some members of Studer\u2019s\nfamily wore buttons with a photo of Studer on them.1\nPrior to opening statements, Musladin\u2019s counsel moved\nthe court to order the Studer family not to wear the but\ntons during the trial. The court denied the motion, stating\nthat it saw \u201cno possible prejudice to the defendant.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 74a.\n   Musladin appealed his conviction to the California\nCourt of Appeal in 1997. He argued that the buttons\ndeprived him of his Fourteenth Amendment and Sixth\nAmendment rights. At the outset of its analysis, the Court\nof Appeal stated that Musladin had to show actual or\ninherent prejudice to succeed on his claim and cited Flynn,\nsupra, at 570, as providing the test for inherent prejudice.\nThe Court of Appeal, quoting part of Flynn\u2019s test, made\nclear that it \u201cconsider[ed] the wearing of photographs of\nvictims in a courtroom to be an \u2018impermissible factor\ncoming into play,\u2019 the practice of which should be discour\naged.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a (quoting Flynn, supra, at\n570). Nevertheless, the court concluded, again quoting\nFlynn, supra, at 571, that the buttons had not \u201cbranded\ndefendant \u2018with an unmistakable mark of guilt\u2019 in the eyes\nof the jurors\u201d because \u201c[t]he simple photograph of Tom\nStuder was unlikely to have been taken as a sign of any\nthing other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of\n[a] family member.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.\n   At the conclusion of the state appellate process,\nMusladin filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in\nfederal district court pursuant to \u00a72254. In his applica\ntion, Musladin argued that the buttons were inherently\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The record contains little concrete information about the buttons.\n\nThe buttons were apparently two to four inches in diameter and dis\nplayed only a photograph of Studer. It is not clear how many family\nmembers wore the buttons or how many days of the trial they wore\nthem.\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprejudicial and that the California Court of Appeal erred\nby holding that the Studers\u2019 wearing of the buttons did not\ndeprive him of a fair trial. The District Court denied\nhabeas relief but granted a certificate of appealability on\nthe buttons issue.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and\nremanded for issuance of the writ, finding that under\n\u00a72254 the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or in\nvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1). According to the Court of\nAppeals, this Court\u2019s decisions in Williams and Flynn\nclearly established a rule of federal law applicable to\nMusladin\u2019s case. Musladin v. Lamarque, 427 F. 3d 653,\n656\u2013658 (2005). Specifically, the Court of Appeals cited its\nown precedent in support of its conclusion that Williams\nand Flynn clearly established the test for inherent preju\ndice applicable to spectators\u2019 courtroom conduct. 427\nF. 3d, at 657\u2013658 (citing Norris v. Risley, 918 F. 2d 828\n(CA9 1990)). The Court of Appeals held that the state\ncourt\u2019s application of a test for inherent prejudice that\ndiffered from the one stated in Williams and Flynn \u201cwas\ncontrary to clearly established federal law and constituted\nan unreasonable application of that law.\u201d 427 F. 3d, at\n659\u2013660. The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc.\n427 F. 3d 647 (2005). We granted certiorari, 547 U. S. ___\n(2006), and now vacate.\n                             II\n  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996, 110 Stat. 1219:\n    \u201c(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on be\n    half of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment\n    of a State court shall not be granted with respect to\n    any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State\n    court proceedings unless the adjudication of the\n4                    CAREY v. MUSLADIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    claim\u2014\n    \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or in\n    volved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\nIn Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000), we explained\nthat \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d in \u00a72254(d)(1) \u201cre\nfers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court\u2019s\ndecisions as of the time of the relevant state-court deci\nsion.\u201d Id., at 412. Therefore, federal habeas relief may be\ngranted here if the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision\nwas contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of\nthis Court\u2019s applicable holdings.\n                                  A\n   In Estelle v. Williams and Flynn, this Court addressed\nthe effect of courtroom practices on defendants\u2019 fair-trial\nrights. In Williams, the Court considered \u201cwhether an\naccused who is compelled to wear identifiable prison cloth\ning at his trial by a jury is denied due process or equal\nprotection of the laws.\u201d 425 U. S., at 502. The Court\nstated that \u201cthe State cannot, consistently with the Four\nteenth Amendment, compel an accused to stand trial\nbefore a jury while dressed in identifiable prison clothes,\u201d\nid., at 512, but held that the defendant in that case had\nwaived any objection to being tried in prison clothes by\nfailing to object at trial, id., at 512\u2013513.\n   In Flynn, the Court addressed whether seating \u201cfour\nuniformed state troopers\u201d in the row of spectators\u2019 seats\nimmediately behind the defendant at trial denied the\ndefendant his right to a fair trial. 475 U. S., at 562. The\nCourt held that the presence of the troopers was not so\ninherently prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair\ntrial. Id., at 571. In reaching that holding, the Court\nstated that \u201cthe question must be . . . whether \u2018an unac\nceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ninto play.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 570 (quoting Williams, supra, at 505).\n  Both Williams and Flynn dealt with government-\nsponsored practices: In Williams, the State compelled the\ndefendant to stand trial in prison clothes, and in Flynn,\nthe State seated the troopers immediately behind the\ndefendant. Moreover, in both cases, this Court noted that\nsome practices are so inherently prejudicial that they\nmust be justified by an \u201cessential state\u201d policy or interest.\nWilliams, supra, at 505 (concluding that the practice\n\u201cfurther[ed] no essential state policy\u201d); Flynn, supra, at\n568\u2013569 (holding that the practice was not of the sort that\nhad to be justified by an \u201cessential state interest\u201d).\n                              B\n   In contrast to state-sponsored courtroom practices, the\neffect on a defendant\u2019s fair-trial rights of the spectator\nconduct to which Musladin objects is an open question in\nour jurisprudence. This Court has never addressed a\nclaim that such private-actor courtroom conduct was so\ninherently prejudicial that it deprived a defendant of a fair\ntrial.2 And although the Court articulated the test for\ninherent prejudice that applies to state conduct in Wil\nliams and Flynn, we have never applied that test to spec\ntators\u2019 conduct. Indeed, part of the legal test of Williams\nand Flynn\u2014asking whether the practices furthered an\nessential state interest\u2014suggests that those cases apply\nonly to state-sponsored practices.\n   Reflecting the lack of guidance from this Court, lower\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 This Court has considered cases in which the proceedings were a\n\nsham or were mob dominated. See Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86, 91\n(1923) (describing allegations that \u201cthe whole proceeding [was] a\nmask\u2014that counsel, jury and judge were swept to the fatal end by an\nirresistible wave of public passion, and that the State Courts failed to\ncorrect the wrong\u201d); Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309, 324\u2013325 (1915)\n(\u201c[T]he disorder in and about the court-room during the trial and up to\nand at the reception of the verdict amounted to mob domination, that\nnot only the jury but the presiding judge succumbed to it\u201d).\n6                   CAREY v. MUSLADIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts have diverged widely in their treatment of defen\ndants\u2019 spectator-conduct claims. Some courts have applied\nWilliams and Flynn to spectators\u2019 conduct. Norris v.\nRisley, 918 F. 2d, at 830\u2013831 (applying Williams and\nFlynn to hold spectators\u2019 buttons worn during a trial\ndeprived the defendant of a fair trial); In re Woods, 154\nWash. 2d 400, 416\u2013418, 114 P. 3d 607, 616\u2013617 (2005) (en\nbanc) (applying Flynn but concluding that ribbons worn by\nspectators did not prejudice the defendant). Other courts\nhave declined to extend Williams and Flynn to spectators\u2019\nconduct. Billings v. Polk, 441 F. 3d 238, 246\u2013247 (CA4\n2006) (\u201cThese precedents do not clearly establish that a\ndefendant\u2019s right to a fair jury trial is violated whenever\nan article of clothing worn at trial arguably conveys a\nmessage about the matter before the jury\u201d); Davis v. State,\nNo. 07\u201303\u20130457\u2013CR, 2006 WL 1211091, *6\u20137 (Tex. App.,\nMay 3, 2006) (\u201cAppellant does not cite any authority hold\ning the display of this type of item by spectators creates\ninherent prejudice\u201d). Other courts have distinguished\nFlynn on the facts. Pachl v. Zenon, 145 Ore. App. 350,\n360, n. 1, 929 P. 2d 1088, 1093\u20131094, n. 1 (1996) (in banc).\nAnd still other courts have ruled on spectator-conduct\nclaims without relying on, discussing, or distinguishing\nWilliams or Flynn. Buckner v. State, 714 So. 2d 384, 388\u2013\n389 (Fla. 1998) (per curiam); State v. Speed, 265 Kan. 26,\n47\u201348, 961 P. 2d 13, 29\u201330 (1998); Nguyen v. State, 977\nS. W. 2d 450, 457 (Tex.

App. 12/17/97), 705\nSo. 2d 758, 763.\n   Given the lack of holdings from this Court regarding the\npotentially prejudicial effect of spectators\u2019 courtroom\nconduct of the kind involved here, it cannot be said that\nthe state court \u201cunreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly estab\nlished Federal law.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).

Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000), this Court\nissued two opinions announcing two separate holdings. In\nPart II\u2013B of Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion, the Court held\nthat an incorrect application of federal law was not neces\nsarily an \u201c \u2018unreasonable application of . . . clearly estab\nlished Federal law\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1). 529 U. S., at 409\u2013413. In Parts III and IV of\nmy opinion, in which Justice O\u2019Connor joined, the Court\nheld that the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the\npetitioner\u2019s claim that he had received ineffective assis\ntance of counsel was both contrary to and an unreasonable\napplication of law as determined by our earlier opinion in\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Williams,\n529 U. S., at 390\u2013398.\n   In Strickland, we held that the petitioner had not been\ndenied the effective assistance of counsel and upheld his\nsentence of death. 466 U. S., at 700. While our ultimate\nholding rejected the petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance\nclaim, the reasoning in our opinion (including carefully\nconsidered dicta) set forth the standards for evaluating\nsuch claims that have been accepted as \u201cclearly estab\nlished law\u201d for over 20 years. See Williams, 529 U. S., at\n391. Nevertheless, in a somewhat ironic dictum in her\nWilliams opinion, Justice O\u2019Connor stated that the statu\n2                      CAREY v. MUSLADIN\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntory phrase \u201cclearly established Federal law, as deter\nmined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d refers\nto \u201cthe holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court\u2019s\ndecisions as of the time of the relevant state-court deci\nsion.\u201d Id., at 412. That dictum has been repeated in three\nsubsequent opinions in which a bare majority of the Court\nrejected constitutional claims that four of us would have\nupheld.* Because I am persuaded that Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s\ndictum about dicta represents an incorrect interpretation\nof the statute\u2019s text, and because its repetition today is\nwholly unnecessary, I do not join the Court\u2019s opinion.\n  Virtually every one of the Court\u2019s opinions announcing a\nnew application of a constitutional principle contains some\nexplanatory language that is intended to provide guidance\nto lawyers and judges in future cases. See, e.g., Crawford\nv. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004); Strickland, 466 U. S.\n668; Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966); see also\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803). It is quite\nwrong to invite state court judges to discount the impor\ntance of such guidance on the ground that it may not have\nbeen strictly necessary as an explanation of the Court\u2019s\nspecific holding in the case. Cf. County of Allegheny v.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chap\nter, 492 U. S. 573, 668 (1989) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part); (\u201cAs a general\nrule, the principle of stare decisis directs us to adhere not\nonly to the holdings of our prior cases, but also their expli\ncations of the governing rules of law\u201d); Sheet Metal Work\ners v.

The text of AEDPA itself provides\nsufficient obstacles to obtaining habeas relief without\nplacing a judicial thumb on the warden\u2019s side of the scales.\n  Ultimately, however, my reasons for joining the Court\u2019s\njudgment in this case are essentially the same as those\nexpressed by JUSTICE SOUTER, with one caveat. In my\nopinion, there is no merit whatsoever to the suggestion\nthat the First Amendment may provide some measure of\nprotection to spectators in a courtroom who engage in\nactual or symbolic speech to express any point of view\nabout an ongoing proceeding.\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

This fundamental principle of due process is\nwell established. It was recognized in Frank v. Mangum,\n237 U. S. 309 (1915), though the Court credited the de\ntermination of the state court and granted no relief; and it\nwas the square holding in Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86\n(1923), though the Court remanded for factfinding rather\nthan for a new trial. The disruptive presence of the press\nrequired reversal in Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333,\n355 (1966), where \u201cnewsmen took over practically the\nentire courtroom, hounding most of the participants in the\ntrial,\u201d and Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 550 (1965), where\nthe presence of cameras distracted jurors throughout the\nproceedings.\n   The rule against a coercive or intimidating atmosphere\nat trial exists because \u201cwe are committed to a government\nof laws and not of men,\u201d under which it is \u201cof the utmost\nimportance that the administration of justice be absolutely\nfair and orderly,\u201d and \u201cthe constitutional safeguards relat\ning to the integrity of the criminal process attend every\nstage of a criminal proceeding . . . culminating with a trial\n\u2018in a courtroom presided over by a judge.\u2019 \u201d Cox v. Louisi\nana, 379 U. S. 559, 562 (1965) (quoting Rideau v. Louisi\nana, 373 U. S. 723, 727 (1963)) (finding a statute did not\n2                   CAREY v. MUSLADIN\n\n              KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\non its face violate First Amendment rights where it pro\nhibited picketing in courthouses). Cf. Wood v. Georgia,\n370 U. S. 375 (1962); Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 466\n(1965).\n   The rule settled by these cases requires a court, on\neither direct or collateral review, to order a new trial when\na defendant shows his conviction has been obtained in a\ntrial tainted by an atmosphere of coercion or intimidation\nsimilar to that documented in the foregoing cases. This\nwould seem to be true whether the pressures were from\npartisans, or, as seems to have been the case in Sheppard,\nfrom persons reacting to the drama of the moment who\ncreated an environment so raucous that calm deliberation\nby the judge or jury was likely compromised in a serious\nway. If, in a given case, intimidation of this nature was\nbrought about by the wearing of buttons, relief under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA) would likely be available even in the absence of\na Supreme Court case addressing the wearing of buttons.\nWhile general rules tend to accord courts \u201cmore leeway . . .\nin reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations,\u201d\nYarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664 (2004) (plural\nity opinion), AEDPA does not require state and federal\ncourts to wait for some nearly identical factual pattern\nbefore a legal rule must be applied. Cf. Wright v. West,\n505 U. S. 277, 308\u2013309 (1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in\njudgment).\n   In the case before us there is no indication the atmos\nphere at respondent\u2019s trial was one of coercion or intimida\ntion to the severe extent demonstrated in the cases just\ndiscussed.    The instant case does present the issue\nwhether as a preventative measure, or as a general rule to\npreserve the calm and dignity of a court, buttons proclaim\ning a message relevant to the case ought to be prohibited\nas a matter of course. That rule has not been clearly\nestablished by our cases to date. It may be that trial\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n              KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\njudges as a general practice already take careful measures\nto preserve the decorum of courtrooms, thereby accounting\nfor the lack of guiding precedents on this subject.\n   In all events, it seems to me the case as presented to us\nhere does call for a new rule, perhaps justified as much as\na preventative measure as by the urgent needs of the\nsituation. That rule should be explored in the court sys\ntem, and then established in this Court before it can be\ngrounds for relief in the procedural posture of this case.\n   For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the\nCourt.\n                  Cite as: 549 U.

S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1). While the ground between criteria entailed\nby \u201cclearly established\u201d and \u201cunreasonable application\u201d\nmay be murky, it makes sense to regard the standard\ngoverning this case as clearly established by this Court.\nWe have a number of decisions dealing with threats to the\nfundamental fairness of a criminal trial posed by condi\ntions in (or originating in) the courtroom, see, e.g., Hol\nbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560 (1986); Estelle v. Williams,\n425 U. S. 501 (1976); Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333\n(1966); Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532 (1965), and the two\nmost recent ones agree on a general formulation harking\nback to Estes, id., at 542\u2013546: the question is whether the\npractice or condition presents \u201c \u2018an unacceptable risk . . . of\nimpermissible factors coming into play\u2019 \u201d in the jury\u2019s\nconsideration of the case. Flynn, supra, at 570 (quoting\nWilliams, supra, at 505). The Court\u2019s intent to adopt a\nstandard at this general and comprehensive level could\nnot be much clearer.\n   As for the applicability of this standard, there is no\nserious question that it reaches the behavior of spectators.\n2                   CAREY v. MUSLADIN\n\n               SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nThe focus of the later cases is on appearances within the\ncourtroom open to the jurors\u2019 observation. There is no\nsuggestion in the opinions, and no reason to think now,\nthat it should matter whether the State or an individual\nmay be to blame for some objectionable sight; either way,\nthe trial judge has an affirmative obligation to control the\ncourtroom and keep it free of improper influence.\nSheppard, supra, at 363. And since the Williams-Flynn\nstandard is a guide for trial judges, not for laypersons\nwithout schooling in threats to the fairness of trials, its\ngeneral formulation is enough to tell trial judges that it\napplies to the behavior of courtroom visitors.\n   Nor is there any reasonable doubt about the pertinence\nof the standard to the practice in question; one could not\nseriously deny that allowing spectators at a criminal trial\nto wear visible buttons with the victim\u2019s photo can raise a\nrisk of improper considerations. The display is no part of\nthe evidence going to guilt or innocence, and the buttons\nare at once an appeal for sympathy for the victim (and\nperhaps for those who wear the buttons) and a call for\nsome response from those who see them. On the jurors\u2019\npart, that expected response could well seem to be a ver\ndict of guilty, and a sympathetic urge to assuage the grief\nor rage of survivors with a conviction would be the para\ndigm of improper consideration.\n   The only debatable question is whether the risk in a\ngiven case reaches the \u201cunacceptable\u201d level. While there is\na fair argument that any level of risk from wearing but\ntons in a courtroom is unacceptable, two considerations\nkeep me from concluding that the state court acted unrea\nsonably in failing to see the issue this way and reverse the\nconviction. First, of the several courts that have consid\nered the influence of spectators\u2019 buttons, the majority have\nleft convictions standing. See, e.g., State v. Speed, 265\nKan. 26, 47\u201348, 961 P. 2d 13, 29\u201330 (1998); State v. Brax\nton, 344 N. C. 702, 709\u2013710, 477 S. E. 2d 172, 176\u2013177\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n               SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(1996); State v. Lord, 128 Wash. App. 216, 219\u2013223, 114\nP. 3d 1241, 1243\u20131245 (2005); Nguyen v. State, 977 S. W.\n2d 450, 457 (Tex. App. 1998). I am wary of assuming that\nevery trial and reviewing judge in those cases was unrea\nsonable as well as mistaken in failing to embrace a no-risk\nstandard, and so I would find it hard to say the state\njudges were unreasonable in this case, given the lack of\ndetail about the buttons\u2019 display. Second, an interest in\nprotected expression on the part of the spectators wearing\nmourners\u2019 buttons has been raised, but not given focus or\ncareful attention in this or any other case that has come to\nour notice. Although I do not find such a First Amend\nment interest intuitively strong here, in the absence of\ndeveloped argument it would be preferable not to decide\nwhether protection of speech could require acceptance of\nsome risk raised by spectators\u2019 buttons.\n  For these reasons, I think Musladin has not shown the\nstate judge\u2019s application of our law to be unreasonable,\nand on that ground concur in the Court\u2019s judgment.\n",

In this case, a state court held that buttons displaying the victim's image worn by the victim's family during respondent's trial did not deny respondent his right to a fair trial. We must decide whether that holding was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as determined by this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). We hold that it was not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On May 13, 1994, respondent Mathew Musladin shot and killed Tom Studer outside the home of Musladin's estranged wife, Pamela. At trial, Musladin admitted that he killed Studer but argued that he did so in self-defense. A California jury rejected Musladin's self-defense argument and convicted him of first-degree murder and three related offenses.</p>\n<p>During Musladin's trial, several members of Studer's family sat in the front row of the spectators' gallery. On at least some of the trial's 14 days, some members of Studer's family wore buttons with a photo of Studer on them.<sup>[1]</sup> Prior to opening <span class=\"star-pagination\">*652</span> statements, Musladin's counsel moved the court to order the Studer family not to wear the buttons during the trial. The court denied the motion, stating that it saw \"no possible prejudice to the defendant.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a.</p>\n<p>Musladin appealed his conviction to the California Court of Appeal in 1997. He argued that the buttons deprived him of his Fourteenth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights. At the outset of its analysis, the Court of Appeal stated that Musladin had to show actual or inherent prejudice to succeed on his claim and cited <i>Flynn, supra,</i> at 570, 106 S.Ct. 1340, as providing the test for inherent prejudice. The Court of Appeal, quoting part of <i>Flynn's</i> test, made clear that it \"consider[ed] the wearing of photographs of victims in a courtroom to be an `impermissible factor coming into play,' the practice of which should be discouraged.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a (quoting <i>Flynn, supra,</i> at 570, 106 S.Ct. 1340). Nevertheless, the court concluded, again quoting <i>Flynn, supra,</i> at 571, 106 S.Ct. 1340, that the buttons had not \"branded defendant `with an unmistakable mark of guilt' in the eyes of the jurors\" because \"[t]he simple photograph of Tom Studer was unlikely to have been taken as a sign of anything other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of [a] family member.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the state appellate process, Musladin filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court pursuant to \u00a7 2254. In his application, Musladin argued that the buttons were inherently prejudicial and that the California Court of Appeal erred by holding that the Studers' wearing of the buttons did not deprive him of a fair trial. The District Court denied habeas relief but granted a certificate of appealability on the buttons issue.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for issuance of the writ, finding that under \u00a7 2254 the state court's decision \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" \u00a7 2254(d)(1). According to the Court of Appeals, this Court's decisions in <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> clearly established a rule of federal law applicable to Musladin's case. <i>Musladin v.</i> <i>Lamarque,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792308\"><a href=\"/opinion/792308/mathew-musladin-v-anthony-lamarque-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span>, 656-658 (2005).

In <i>Williams,</i> the Court considered \"whether an accused who is compelled to wear identifiable prison clothing at his trial by a jury is denied due process or equal protection of the laws.\" 425 U.S., at 502, 96 S.Ct. 1691. The Court stated that \"the State cannot, consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, compel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed in identifiable prison clothes,\" <i>id.,</i> at 512, 96 S.Ct. 1691, but held that the defendant in that case had waived any objection to being tried in prison clothes by failing to object at trial, <i>id.,</i> at 512-513, 96 S.Ct. 1691.</p>\n<p>In <i>Flynn,</i> the Court addressed whether seating \"four uniformed state troopers\" in the row of spectators' seats immediately behind the defendant at trial denied the defendant his right to a fair trial. 475 U.S., at 562, 106 S.Ct. 1340. The Court held that the presence of the troopers was not so inherently prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 571, 106 S.Ct. 1340. In reaching that holding, the Court stated that \"the question must be... whether `an unacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 570, 106 S.Ct. 1340 (quoting <i>Williams, supra,</i> at 505, 96 S.Ct. 1691).</p>\n<p>Both <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> dealt with government-sponsored practices: In <i>Williams,</i> the State compelled the defendant to stand trial in prison clothes, and in <i>Flynn,</i> the State seated the troopers immediately behind the defendant. Moreover, in both cases, this Court noted that some practices are so inherently prejudicial that they must be justified by an \"essential state\" policy or interest. <i>Williams, supra,</i> at 505, 96 S.Ct. 1691 (concluding that the practice \"further[ed] no essential state policy\"); <i>Flynn, supra,</i> at 568-569, 106 S.Ct. 1340 (holding that the practice was not of the sort that had to be justified by an \"essential state interest\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In contrast to state-sponsored courtroom practices, the effect on a defendant's fair-trial rights of the spectator conduct to which Musladin objects is an open question in our jurisprudence. This Court has never addressed a claim that such private-actor courtroom conduct was so inherently prejudicial that it deprived a defendant of a fair trial.<sup>[2]</sup> And although the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*654</span> Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice that applies to state conduct in <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn,</i> we have never applied that test to spectators' conduct. Indeed, part of the legal test of <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i>\u0097asking whether the practices furthered an essential <i>state</i> interest\u0097suggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices.</p>\n<p>Reflecting the lack of guidance from this Court, lower courts have diverged widely in their treatment of defendants' spectator-conduct claims. Some courts have applied <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> to spectators' conduct. <i>Norris v. Risley,</i> 918 F.2d, at 830-831 (applying <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> to hold spectators' buttons worn during a trial deprived the defendant of a fair trial); <i>In re Woods,</i> 154 Wash.2d 400, 416-418, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2590657\"><a href=\"/opinion/2590657/in-re-woods/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, 616-617 (2005) (applying <i>Flynn</i> but concluding that ribbons worn by spectators did not prejudice the defendant). Other courts have declined to extend <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> to spectators' conduct. <i>Billings v.

No holding of this Court required the California Court of Appeal to apply the test of <i>Williams</i> and <i>Flynn</i> to the spectators' conduct here. Therefore, the state court's decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals improperly concluded that the California Court of Appeal's decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by this Court. For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>In <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*655</span> this Court issued two opinions announcing two separate holdings. In Part II-B of Justice O'Connor's opinion, the Court held that an incorrect application of federal law was not necessarily an \"`unreasonable application of ... clearly established Federal law'\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). 529 U.S., at 409-413, 120 S.Ct. 1495. In Parts III and IV of my opinion, in which Justice O'Connor joined, the Court held that the Virginia Supreme Court's rejection of the petitioner's claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel was both contrary to and an unreasonable application of law as determined by our earlier opinion in <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S., at 390-398, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p>In <i>Strickland,</i> we held that the petitioner had not been denied the effective assistance of counsel and upheld his sentence of death. 466 U.S., at 700, 104 S.Ct. 2052. While our ultimate <i>holding</i> rejected the petitioner's ineffective-assistance claim, the reasoning in our opinion (including carefully considered <i>dicta</i>) set forth the standards for evaluating such claims that have been accepted as \"clearly established law\" for over 20 years. See <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S., at 391, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Nevertheless, in a somewhat ironic dictum in her <i>Williams</i> opinion, Justice O'Connor stated that the statutory phrase \"clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" refers to \"the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495. That dictum has been repeated in three subsequent opinions in which a bare majority of the Court rejected constitutional claims that four of us would have upheld.<sup>[*]</sup> Because I am persuaded that Justice O'Connor's dictum about dicta represents an incorrect interpretation of the statute's text, and because its repetition today is wholly unnecessary, I do not join the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>Virtually every one of the Court's opinions announcing a new application of a constitutional principle contains some explanatory language that is intended to provide guidance to lawyers and judges in future cases. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004); <i>Strickland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <i>Miranda v.

Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). It is quite wrong to invite state-court judges to discount the importance of such guidance on the ground that it may not have been strictly necessary as an explanation of the Court's specific holding in the case. Cf. <i>County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112331\"><a href=\"/opinion/112331/allegheny-county-v-greater-pittsburgh-aclu/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>, 668, 109 S.Ct. 3086, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (\"As a general rule, the principle of <i>stare decisis</i> directs us to adhere not only to the holdings of our prior cases, but also their explications of the governing rules of law\"); <i>Sheet Metal Workers v.

The text of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 itself provides sufficient obstacles to obtaining habeas relief without placing a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*656</span> judicial thumb on the warden's side of the scales.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, my reasons for joining the Court's judgment in this case are essentially the same as those expressed by Justice SOUTER, with one caveat. In my opinion, there is no merit whatsoever to the suggestion that the First Amendment may provide some measure of protection to spectators in a courtroom who engage in actual or symbolic speech to express any point of view about an ongoing proceeding.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Trials must be free from a coercive or intimidating atmosphere. This fundamental principle of due process is well established. It was recognized in <i>Frank v. Mangum,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98441\"><a href=\"/opinion/98441/frank-v-mangum/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span>, 35 S.Ct. 582, 59 L.Ed. 969 (1915), though the Court credited the determination of the state court and granted no relief; and it was the square holding in <i>Moore v. Dempsey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100122\"><a href=\"/opinion/100122/moore-v-dempsey/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 43 S.Ct. 265, 67 L.Ed. 543 (1923), though the Court remanded for factfinding rather than for a new trial. The disruptive presence of the press required reversal in <i>Sheppard v. Maxwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107247\"><a href=\"/opinion/107247/sheppard-v-maxwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 355, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966), where \"newsmen took over practically the entire courtroom, hounding most of the participants in the trial,\" and <i>Estes v.

Louisiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106968\"><a href=\"/opinion/106968/cox-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span>, 562, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965) (quoting <i>Rideau v.

Cf. <i>Wood v.

This would seem to be true whether the pressures were from partisans, or, as seems to have been the case in <i>Sheppard,</i> from persons reacting to the drama of the moment who created an environment so raucous that calm deliberation by the judge or jury was likely compromised in a serious way. If, in a given case, intimidation of this nature was brought about by the wearing of buttons, relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) would likely be available even in the absence of a Supreme Court case addressing the wearing of buttons. While general rules tend to accord courts \"more leeway ... in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations,\" <i>Yarborough v. Alvarado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134748\"><a href=\"/opinion/134748/yarborough-v-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004), AEDPA does not require state and federal courts to wait for some nearly identical factual pattern before a legal rule must be applied, cf. <i>Wright v. West,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112771\"><a href=\"/opinion/112771/wright-v-west/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span>, 308-309, 112 S.Ct. 2482, 120 L.Ed.2d 225 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*657</span> (1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>In the case before us there is no indication the atmosphere at respondent's trial was one of coercion or intimidation to the severe extent demonstrated in the cases just discussed. The instant case does present the issue whether as a preventative measure, or as a general rule to preserve the calm and dignity of a court, buttons proclaiming a message relevant to the case ought to be prohibited as a matter of course. That rule has not been clearly established by our cases to date. It may be that trial judges as a general practice already take careful measures to preserve the decorum of courtrooms, thereby accounting for the lack of guiding precedents on this subject.</p>\n<p>In all events, it seems to me the case as presented to us here does call for a new rule, perhaps justified as much as a preventative measure as by the urgent needs of the situation. That rule should be explored in the court system, and then established in this Court before it can be grounds for relief in the procedural posture of this case.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>In this habeas proceeding, a federal court may not set aside the state judgment sustaining Musladin's conviction without finding it contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). While the ground between criteria entailed by \"clearly established\" and \"unreasonable application\" may be murky, it makes sense to regard the standard governing this case as clearly established by this Court. We have a number of decisions dealing with threats to the fundamental fairness of a criminal trial posed by conditions in (or originating in) the courtroom, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Holbrook v. Flynn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111619\"><a href=\"/opinion/111619/holbrook-v-flynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. 1340, 89 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986); <i>Estelle v.

The Court's intent to adopt a standard at this general and comprehensive level could not be much clearer.</p>\n<p>As for the applicability of this standard, there is no serious question that it reaches the behavior of spectators. The focus of the later cases is on appearances within the courtroom open to the jurors' observation. There is no suggestion in the opinions, and no reason to think now, that it should matter whether the State or an individual may be to blame for some objectionable sight; either way, the trial judge has an affirmative obligation to control the courtroom and keep it free of improper influence. <i>Sheppard, supra,</i> at 363, 86 S.Ct. 1507. And since the <i>Williams-Flynn</i> standard is a guide for trial judges, not for laypersons without schooling in threats to the fairness of trials, its general formulation is enough to tell trial judges that it applies to the behavior of courtroom visitors.</p>\n<p>Nor is there any reasonable doubt about the pertinence of the standard to the practice in question; one could not seriously deny that allowing spectators at a criminal trial to wear visible buttons with the victim's photo can raise a risk of improper considerations. The display is no part of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*658</span> the evidence going to guilt or innocence, and the buttons are at once an appeal for sympathy for the victim (and perhaps for those who wear the buttons) and a call for some response from those who see them. On the jurors' part, that expected response could well seem to be a verdict of guilty, and a sympathetic urge to assuage the grief or rage of survivors with a conviction would be the paradigm of improper consideration.</p>\n<p>The only debatable question is whether the risk in a given case reaches the \"unacceptable\" level. While there is a fair argument that any level of risk from wearing buttons in a courtroom is unacceptable, two considerations keep me from concluding that the state court acted unreasonably in failing to see the issue this way and reverse the conviction. First, of the several courts that have considered the influence of spectators' buttons, the majority have left convictions standing. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>State v.

State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1799520\"><a href=\"/opinion/1799520/nguyen-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, 457 (Tex.App.1998). I am wary of assuming that every trial and reviewing judge in those cases was unreasonable as well as mistaken in failing to embrace a no-risk standard, and so I would find it hard to say the state judges were unreasonable in this case, given the lack of detail about the buttons' display. Second, an interest in protected expression on the part of the spectators wearing mourners' buttons has been raised, but not given focus or careful attention in this or any other case that has come to our notice. Although I do not find such a First Amendment interest intuitively strong here, in the absence of developed argument it would be preferable not to decide whether protection of speech could require acceptance of some risk raised by spectators' buttons.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I think Musladin has not shown the state judge's application of our law to be unreasonable, and on that ground concur in the Court's judgment.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The record contains little concrete information about the buttons. The buttons were apparently two to four inches in diameter and displayed only a photograph of Studer. It is not clear how many family members wore the buttons or how many days of the trial they wore them.</p>\n<p>[2]  This Court has considered cases in which the proceedings were a sham or were mob dominated.
