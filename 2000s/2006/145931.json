SOLEDAD NATIONAL\n              WAR MEMORIAL\n05A1233              v.\n             PHILIP K. PAULSON\n        CITY OF SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA\n05A1234               v.\n              PHILIP K. PAULSON\n                     ON APPLICATIONS FOR STAYS\n          Nos. 05A1233 and 05A1234. Decided July 7, 2006\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY, Circuit Justice.\n   In this long-running federal-court litigation the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of Califor\nnia has ordered that, within 90 days of May 3, 2006, the\ncity of San Diego, California, must comply with an earlier\ninjunction, affirmed on appeal, that barred the city from\nmaintaining a prominent Latin cross at a veterans\u2019 memo\nrial on city property. The premise of the injunction was\nthat the cross\u2019 permanent presence there violates the\nCalifornia State Constitution. See Murphy v. Bilbray, 782\nF. Supp. 1420, 1426\u20131427, 1438 (SD Cal. 1991), aff\u2019d, Ellis\nv. La Mesa, 990 F. 2d 1518, 1520 (CA9 1993), cert. denied\nsub nom. San Diego v. Paulson, 513 U. S. 925 (1994); see\nalso Paulson v. San Diego, 294 F. 3d 1124, 1133, and n. 7\n(CA9 2002) (en banc) (holding that a proposed sale of the\nmemorial violated the state constitution), cert. denied, 538\nU. S. 978 (2003). The city has appealed from the District\nCourt\u2019s order to the United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit. The Court of Appeals has ordered expe\ndited briefing and scheduled oral argument for the week of\nOctober 16, 2006; it denied, however, a motion to stay the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order pending appeal. In No. 05A1234,\n2      MT. SOLEDAD NAT. WAR MEMORIAL v. PAULSON\n\n                      Opinion in Chambers\n\nthe city of San Diego has applied to me, as Circuit Justice,\nfor a stay pending appeal. In No. 05A1233, the San Die\ngans for the Mt. Soledad National War Memorial, a pro\nposed intervenor in the case, likewise applies for a stay.\nOn July 3, 2006, I issued a temporary stay pending fur\nther order. I now grant the city\u2019s application, while deny\ning the proposed intervenor\u2019s application as moot.\n   In considering stay applications on matters pending\nbefore the Court of Appeals, a Circuit Justice must \u201ctry to\npredict whether four Justices would vote to grant certio\nrari should the Court of Appeals affirm the District Court\norder without modification; try to predict whether the\nCourt would then set the order aside; and balance the\nso-called \u2018stay equities.\u2019 \u201d INS v. Legalization Assistance\nProject of Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, 510 U. S.\n1301, 1304 (1993) (O\u2019Connor, J., in chambers)); see also, e.g.,\nHeckler v. Redbud Hospital Dist., 473 U. S. 1308, 1311\u20131312\n(1985) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers). \u201cThis is always a diffi\ncult and speculative inquiry.\u201d Legalization Assistance Pro\nject, supra, at 1304. Although \u201ca stay application to a\nCircuit Justice on a matter before a court of appeals is\nrarely granted,\u201d Heckler, 473 U. S., at 1312 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted), consideration of the relevant factors\nleads me to conclude that a stay is appropriate in this case.\n   To begin with, the equities here support preserving the\nstatus quo while the city\u2019s appeal proceeds. Compared to\nthe irreparable harm of altering the memorial and remov\ning the cross, the harm in a brief delay pending the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 expedited consideration of the case seems\nslight. In addition, two further factors make this case\n\u201csufficiently unusual,\u201d ibid., to warrant granting a stay.\nFirst, a recent Act of Congress has deemed the monument\na \u201cnational memorial honoring veterans of the United\nStates Armed Forces\u201d and has authorized the Secretary of\nthe Interior to take title to the memorial on behalf of the\nUnited States if the city offers to donate it. \u00a7116, 118\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\nStat. 3346. Because this legislation postdates the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 previous decisions in this case, its effect on the\nlitigation has yet to be considered. Second, San Diego\nvoters, seeking to carry out the transfer contemplated by\nthe federal statute, have approved a ballot proposition\nauthorizing donation of the monument to the United\nStates. While the Superior Court of California for the\nCounty of San Diego has invalidated the ballot proposition\non the grounds that the proposed transfer would violate\nthe California Constitution, Paulson v. Abdelnour, No.\nGIC\u2013849667 (Oct. 7, 2005), p. 35, the California Court of\nAppeal for the Fourth Appellate District has issued an\norder expediting the city\u2019s appeal of the Superior Court\ndecision, see Paulson v. Abdelnour, No. D047702 (June 20,\n2006).\n   If the state appellate court reverses the Superior Court\nand allows the memorial to become federal property, its\ndecision may moot the District Court\u2019s injunction, which\naddresses only the legality under state law of the cross\u2019\npresence on city property, see Murphy, supra, at 1438.\nThis parallel state-court litigation, furthermore, may\npresent an opportunity for California courts to address\nstate-law issues pertinent to the District Court\u2019s injunc\ntion. The state appellate court\u2019s decision may provide\nimportant guidance regarding those issues and the effect,\nif any, of the recent federal statute.\n   Although the Court denied certiorari in this litigation at\nearlier stages, Congress\u2019 evident desire to preserve the\nmemorial makes it substantially more likely that four\nJustices will agree to review the case in the event the\nCourt of Appeals affirms the District Court\u2019s order. The\npreviously unaddressed issues created by the federal\nstatute, moreover, reinforce the equities supporting a stay;\nand the pendency of state-court litigation that may clarify\nthe state-law basis for the District Court\u2019s order further\nsupports preserving the status quo. Accordingly, although\n4      MT. SOLEDAD NAT. WAR MEMORIAL v. PAULSON\n\n                    Opinion in Chambers\n\nthe Court, and individual Circuit Justices, should be most\nreluctant to disturb interim actions of the Court of Ap\npeals in cases pending before it, the respect due both to\nCongress and to the parallel state-court proceedings per\nsuades me that the District Court\u2019s order in this case\nshould be stayed pending final disposition of the appeal by\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nor until further order of this Court. If circumstances\nchange significantly, the parties may apply to this Court\nfor reconsideration.\n   For these reasons, the application in No. 05A1234 is\nhereby granted. The proposed intervenor San Diegans for\nthe Mt. Soledad National War Memorial was denied leave\nto intervene in the District Court and in all events seeks\nno relief beyond the stay granted in No. 05A1234. Sepa\nrate consideration of the application in No. 05A1233 thus\nis unnecessary and this application hereby is denied.\n",
