Decided June 12, 2006\n\n  J USTICE T HOMAS, dissenting from the denial of\ncertiorari.\n  Under our Constitution, a person accused of a crime is\nentitled to a \u201ctrial, by an impartial jury of the State and\ndistrict wherein the crime shall have been committed,\u201d\nAmdt. 6, pursuant to an indictment for that offense by a\ngrand jury, Amdt. 5. See also Art. III, \u00a72, cl. 3 (\u201cThe Trial\nof all Crimes . . . shall be by Jury\u201d). Determining the\nproper scope of these constitutional rights requires a\ndefinition of the term \u201ccrime.\u201d As I have previously writ\nten, \u201ca \u2018crime\u2019 includes every fact that is by law a basis for\nimposing or increasing punishment.\u201d Apprendi v.

S. 466, 501 (2000) (concurring opinion)\n(emphasis added).\n   Notwithstanding the broad meaning of the term \u201ccrime,\u201d\nthis Court has qualified the protections of the Fifth and\nSixth Amendments by holding that, \u201c[o]ther than the fact\nof a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty\nfor a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum\nmust be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reason\nable doubt.\u201d Id., at 490 (emphasis added). But the excep\ntion to trial by jury for establishing \u201cthe fact of a prior\nconviction\u201d finds its basis not in the Constitution, but in a\nprecedent of this Court. See Almendarez-Torres v. United\nStates, 523 U. S. 224 (1998). Moreover, it has long been\nclear that a majority of this Court now rejects that excep\ntion. See Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 27\u201328\n(2005) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment); see also Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 248\u2013249\n(SCALIA, J., joined by STEVENS, SOUTER, and GINSBURG,\nJJ., dissenting); Apprendi, supra, at 520\u2013521 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring).\n   In our previous cases, the parties have not asked this\nCourt to overrule Almendarez-Torres. Apprendi, supra, at\n489\u2013490; Shepard, supra, at 28 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment). Last Term, I indicated\nthat the Court should address the ongoing validity of the\nAlmendarez-Torres exception in an appropriate case.\nShepard, supra, at 28.
