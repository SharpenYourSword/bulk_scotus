The\nanswer to that question determines the actual amount of\ngood-time credits that prisoners serving federal sentences\nmay earn, and therefore how much time they may actually\nspend in prison. For prisoners who consistently comply\nwith prison regulations, the difference in approaches\namounts to about a week for each year of their sentences.\nThe issue, accordingly, is of great importance to such\nprisoners.

Nevertheless, I think it appropriate to empha\nsize that the Court\u2019s action does not constitute a ruling on\nthe merits and certainly does not represent an expression\nof any opinion concerning the wisdom of the Government\u2019s\nposition.

(case below in No. 05-8268),\nrev\u2019d, 431 F. 3d 180 (CA5 2005), both the text and the\nhistory of the statute strongly suggest that it was not\nintended to alter the pre-existing approach of calculating\ngood-time credit based on the sentence imposed.\n   Despite its technical character, the question has suffi\ncient importance to merit further study, not only by judges\nbut by other Government officials as well. Nine out of ten\nCircuits have recognized that the Federal Bureau of Pris\nons has the discretion to adopt petitioners\u2019 approach, and\nCongress of course has the power to clarify the matter.\nIndeed, Congress has done so once before\u2014in 1959 Con\ngress amended the predecessor statute to \u00a73624(b) for the\nspecific purpose of undoing a judicial determination that\ncredit should be based on time served rather than on the\nsentence imposed.

(1959).\nCongress rejected this judicial determination because it\nhad the troubling effect of \u201crequir[ing] well-behaved pris\noners to serve longer sentences of confinement than they\nwould under the method of computation which has been\nused through half a century.\u201d Id., at 2.
