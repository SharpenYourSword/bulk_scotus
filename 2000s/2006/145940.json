HANFT, UNITED STATES\n\n       NAVY COMMANDER, CONSOLIDATED \n\n                   NAVAL BRIG\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 05\u2013533.   Decided April 3, 2006 \n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. JUSTICE\nSOUTER, JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER would\ngrant the petition for a writ of certiorari.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and\nJUSTICE STEVENS join, concurring in the denial of\ncertiorari.\n   The Court\u2019s decision to deny the petition for writ of\ncertiorari is, in my view, a proper exercise of its discretion\nin light of the circumstances of the case. The history of\npetitioner Jose Padilla\u2019s detention, however, does require\nthis brief explanatory statement.\n   Padilla is a United States citizen. Acting pursuant to a\nmaterial witness warrant issued by the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York,\nfederal agents apprehended Padilla at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare\nInternational Airport on May 8, 2002. He was transported\nto New York, and on May 22 he moved to vacate the war\nrant. On June 9, while that motion was pending, the\nPresident issued an order to the Secretary of Defense\ndesignating Padilla an enemy combatant and ordering his\nmilitary detention. The District Court, notified of this\naction by the Government\u2019s ex parte motion, vacated the\nmaterial witness warrant.\n   Padilla was taken to the Consolidated Naval Brig in\nCharleston, South Carolina. On June 11, Padilla\u2019s counsel\nfiled a habeas corpus petition in the Southern District of\n2                    PADILLA v. HANFT\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nNew York challenging the military detention. The District\nCourt denied the petition, but the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed and ordered the issuance of a writ\ndirecting Padilla\u2019s release. This Court granted certiorari\nand ordered dismissal of the habeas corpus petition with\nout prejudice, holding that the District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York was not the appropriate\ncourt to consider it. See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U. S. 426\n(2004).\n  The present case arises from Padilla\u2019s subsequent ha\nbeas corpus petition, filed in the United States District\nCourt for the District of South Carolina on July 2, 2004.\nPadilla requested that he be released immediately or else\ncharged with a crime. The District Court granted the\npetition on February 28, 2005, but the Court of Appeals for\nthe Fourth Circuit reversed that judgment on September\n9, 2005. Padilla then filed the instant petition for writ of\ncertiorari.\n  After Padilla sought certiorari in this Court, the Gov\nernment obtained an indictment charging him with vari\nous federal crimes. The President ordered that Padilla be\nreleased from military custody and transferred to the\ncontrol of the Attorney General to face criminal charges.\nThe Government filed a motion for approval of Padilla\u2019s\ntransfer in the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\nThe Court of Appeals denied the motion, but this Court\ngranted the Government\u2019s subsequent application respect\ning the transfer. Hanft v. Padilla, 546 U. S. ___ (2006).\nThe Government also filed a brief in opposition to certio\nrari, arguing, among other things, that Padilla\u2019s petition\nshould be denied as moot.\n  The Government\u2019s mootness argument is based on the\npremise that Padilla, now having been charged with\ncrimes and released from military custody, has received\nthe principal relief he sought. Padilla responds that his\ncase was not mooted by the Government\u2019s voluntary ac\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\ntions because there remains a possibility that he will be\nredesignated and redetained as an enemy combatant.\n   Whatever the ultimate merits of the parties\u2019 mootness\narguments, there are strong prudential considerations\ndisfavoring the exercise of the Court\u2019s certiorari power.\nEven if the Court were to rule in Padilla\u2019s favor, his pre\nsent custody status would be unaffected. Padilla is sched\nuled to be tried on criminal charges. Any consideration of\nwhat rights he might be able to assert if he were returned\nto military custody would be hypothetical, and to no effect,\nat this stage of the proceedings.\n   In light of the previous changes in his custody status\nand the fact that nearly four years have passed since he\nfirst was detained, Padilla, it must be acknowledged, has a\ncontinuing concern that his status might be altered again.\nThat concern, however, can be addressed if the necessity\narises. Padilla is now being held pursuant to the control\nand supervision of the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida, pending trial of the criminal\ncase. In the course of its supervision over Padilla\u2019s cus\ntody and trial the District Court will be obliged to afford\nhim the protection, including the right to a speedy trial,\nguaranteed to all federal criminal defendants. See, e.g.,\nU. S. Const., Amdt. 6; 18 U. S. C. \u00a73161. Were the Gov\nernment to seek to change the status or conditions of\nPadilla\u2019s custody, that court would be in a position to rule\nquickly on any responsive filings submitted by Padilla. In\nsuch an event, the District Court, as well as other courts of\ncompetent jurisdiction, should act promptly to ensure that\nthe office and purposes of the writ of habeas corpus are not\ncompromised. Padilla, moreover, retains the option of\nseeking a writ of habeas corpus in this Court. See this\nCourt\u2019s Rule 20; 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71651(a), 2241.\n   That Padilla\u2019s claims raise fundamental issues respect\ning the separation of powers, including consideration of\nthe role and function of the courts, also counsels against\n4                   PADILLA v. HANFT\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\naddressing those claims when the course of legal proceed\nings has made them, at least for now, hypothetical. This\nis especially true given that Padilla\u2019s current custody is\npart of the relief he sought, and that its lawfulness is\nuncontested.\n  These are the reasons for my vote to deny certiorari.\n",
