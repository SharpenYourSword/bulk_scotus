Decided March 27, 2006\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins, con-\ncurring in the denial of certiorari.\n   This case presents an important question of statutory\nconstruction—whether “actual damages” must be shown\nbefore a plaintiff may recover under the Driver’s Privacy\nProtection Act, 18 U. S. C. §2724(b)(1). The Florida De-\npartment of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles sold to\npetitioner, for a penny a piece, the names and addresses of\n565,600 individuals in three counties who registered cars\nwith the DMV—the total cost was thus $5,656. Petitioner\nintended to mail these individuals a solicitation to refi-\nnance their automobile loans. However, because Florida—\nalone among the States—had not immediately amended\nits law to comply with the Act, none of these people had\ngiven their “express consent” to the release of this infor-\nmation, as the Act requires. §2721(b)(12). Petitioner now\nfaces a possible $1.4 billion judgment—$2,500 per viola-\ntion. Because of other class actions currently pending in\nFlorida, involving the same question, the total amount at\nstake may reach $40 billion. This enormous potential\nliability, which turns on a question of federal statutory\ninterpretation, is a strong factor in deciding whether to\n2       FIDELITY FEDERAL BANK & TRUST v.

Geller, Supreme Court Practice 248 (8th ed.\n2002).\n   Nonetheless, I concur in the denial of certiorari. A\nsecond and equally important legal question is bound up\nin this case—namely, whether petitioner can be held liable\nunder the Act if it did not know that the State had failed\nto comply with the Act’s “express consent” requirement.\nThe District Court did not reach this issue since it\nawarded summary judgment to petitioner on the actual\ndamages question. The scienter question remains open in\nlight of the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment reversing and\nremanding the case. See 421 F. 3d 1209 (2005). Depend-\ning on the course of proceedings below, it may later be\nappropriate for us to consider granting certiorari as to\neither or both issues.
