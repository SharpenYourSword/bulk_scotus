Decided October 10, 2006 \n\n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS respecting the denial of\nthe petition for writ of certiorari.\n    The limitations period in the Antiterrorism and Effec\ntive Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) requires a “per\nson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court”\nto file an application for a writ of habeas corpus within one\nyear of “the date on which the judgment became final\n. . . .” 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(1)(A). This case raises the\nquestion whether a Texas order of “deferred adjudication\nprobation” is a “judgment” under the statute. In essence,\na deferred adjudication probation order places a defendant\non probation while postponing any adjudication of guilt.\nSee Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 42.12, §5 (Vernon\n2006 Supp. Pamphlet). If the defendant successfully\ncompletes the terms of his probation, the charges against\nhim are dismissed, §5(c); if he violates those terms, he is\nfound guilty and sentenced, §5(b). See generally Taylor v.\nState, 131 S. W. 3d 497, 499–500 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\nOften, a defendant’s case is finally resolved many years\nafter the entry of the order of deferred adjudication.\n2               CALDWELL v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                   Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\n   That is precisely what happened here. Petitioners\nRobert Caldwell and Pete Martinez pleaded guilty and\nwere placed on deferred adjudication probation. Both\nsubsequently violated the terms of their probation, had\ntheir probation revoked, were adjudicated guilty pursuant\nto their earlier pleas, and were given lengthy prison sen\ntences. Promptly after the entry of orders revoking their\nprobation, petitioners applied for federal writs of habeas\ncorpus. The Court of Appeals held that their applications\nwere time barred because they were filed more than one\nyear after the entry of orders deferring adjudication. The\nheart of the Fifth Circuit’s holding is that these earlier\norders were final judgments under AEDPA.\n   However, as Judge DeMoss noted in his dissent, there\n“are two absolute essentials to a final judgment in a crimi\nnal case”—first, a determination of guilt or innocence, and\nsecond, the imposition of a sentence. Caldwell v. Dretke,\n429 F. 3d 521, 531 (CA5 2005). Neither occurred prior to\nthe revocation of petitioners’ probation. Indeed, reconcil\ning the majority’s conclusion with AEDPA’s text is particu\nlarly difficult because Texas law provides that a “judgment\nis the written declaration of the court signed by the trial\njudge and entered of record showing the conviction or\nacquittal of the defendant.” Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,\nArt. 42.01, §1 (Vernon 2006 Supp. Pamphlet) (emphasis\nadded). An order of deferred adjudication probation is not\na conviction, and it is therefore not a “judgment” under\nTexas law. See Davis v. State, 968 S. W. 2d 368, 371 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1998). Under a literal reading of the federal\nstatute, such an order cannot be a “judgment of a State\ncourt” within the strict terms of §2244(d)(1)(A).\n   Despite this conflict between the Court of Appeals deci\nsion and the plain text of AEDPA, our decision to deny\ncertiorari is supported by at least two valid considerations.\nFirst, if a court is convinced that a nonliteral reading of a\nstatute is more faithful to the actual intent of the enacting\n                     Cite as: 549 U.

Sigmon Coal\nCo., 534 U. S. 438, 472 (2002) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\nIn this case, the Fifth Circuit had a justifiable basis for\nconcluding that a nonliteral reading is consistent with\nCongress’ intent to “ ‘curb the abuse of the statutory writ\nof habeas corpus’ ” and “ ‘address problems of unnecessary\ndelay.’ ” See 429 F. 3d, at 528 (quoting H. R. Conf. Rep.\nNo. 104–518, p. 111 (1996)). Second, the Court of Appeals\nexpressly limited its holding to “instances where a peti\ntioner” brings an untimely challenge to “substantive issues\nrelating to an original order of deferred adjudication pro\nbation.” 429 F. 3d, at 530, n. 24. It did not foreclose\ntimely challenges to such orders, nor did it foreclose timely\nchallenges to the sentencing aspects of the revocation\nproceedings. The Fifth Circuit also did nothing to upset\nthe practice of deferred adjudication probation itself,\nwhich confers considerable benefits upon defendants who\ndo not violate the terms of their probation.* This narrow\nholding is unlikely to produce injustice.
