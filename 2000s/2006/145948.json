Decided October 10, 2006 \n\n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS respecting the denial of\nthe petition for writ of certiorari.\n    The limitations period in the Antiterrorism and Effec\ntive Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) requires a \u201cper\nson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\u201d\nto file an application for a writ of habeas corpus within one\nyear of \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final\n. . . .\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). This case raises the\nquestion whether a Texas order of \u201cdeferred adjudication\nprobation\u201d is a \u201cjudgment\u201d under the statute. In essence,\na deferred adjudication probation order places a defendant\non probation while postponing any adjudication of guilt.\nSee Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 42.12, \u00a75 (Vernon\n2006 Supp. Pamphlet). If the defendant successfully\ncompletes the terms of his probation, the charges against\nhim are dismissed, \u00a75(c); if he violates those terms, he is\nfound guilty and sentenced, \u00a75(b). See generally Taylor v.\nState, 131 S. W. 3d 497, 499\u2013500 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\nOften, a defendant\u2019s case is finally resolved many years\nafter the entry of the order of deferred adjudication.\n2               CALDWELL v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                   Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\n   That is precisely what happened here. Petitioners\nRobert Caldwell and Pete Martinez pleaded guilty and\nwere placed on deferred adjudication probation. Both\nsubsequently violated the terms of their probation, had\ntheir probation revoked, were adjudicated guilty pursuant\nto their earlier pleas, and were given lengthy prison sen\ntences. Promptly after the entry of orders revoking their\nprobation, petitioners applied for federal writs of habeas\ncorpus. The Court of Appeals held that their applications\nwere time barred because they were filed more than one\nyear after the entry of orders deferring adjudication. The\nheart of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding is that these earlier\norders were final judgments under AEDPA.\n   However, as Judge DeMoss noted in his dissent, there\n\u201care two absolute essentials to a final judgment in a crimi\nnal case\u201d\u2014first, a determination of guilt or innocence, and\nsecond, the imposition of a sentence. Caldwell v. Dretke,\n429 F. 3d 521, 531 (CA5 2005). Neither occurred prior to\nthe revocation of petitioners\u2019 probation. Indeed, reconcil\ning the majority\u2019s conclusion with AEDPA\u2019s text is particu\nlarly difficult because Texas law provides that a \u201cjudgment\nis the written declaration of the court signed by the trial\njudge and entered of record showing the conviction or\nacquittal of the defendant.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,\nArt. 42.01, \u00a71 (Vernon 2006 Supp. Pamphlet) (emphasis\nadded). An order of deferred adjudication probation is not\na conviction, and it is therefore not a \u201cjudgment\u201d under\nTexas law. See Davis v. State, 968 S. W. 2d 368, 371 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1998). Under a literal reading of the federal\nstatute, such an order cannot be a \u201cjudgment of a State\ncourt\u201d within the strict terms of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A).\n   Despite this conflict between the Court of Appeals deci\nsion and the plain text of AEDPA, our decision to deny\ncertiorari is supported by at least two valid considerations.\nFirst, if a court is convinced that a nonliteral reading of a\nstatute is more faithful to the actual intent of the enacting\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)                    3\n\n                       Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\nCongress, that reading should normally be preferred. See,\ne.g., Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. ___ (2006); Koons Buick\nPontiac GMC, Inc. v. Nigh, 543 U. S. 50 (2004); see also\nDodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 361\u2013362, and n. 1\n(2005) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal\nCo., 534 U. S. 438, 472 (2002) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\nIn this case, the Fifth Circuit had a justifiable basis for\nconcluding that a nonliteral reading is consistent with\nCongress\u2019 intent to \u201c \u2018curb the abuse of the statutory writ\nof habeas corpus\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018address problems of unnecessary\ndelay.\u2019 \u201d See 429 F. 3d, at 528 (quoting H. R. Conf. Rep.\nNo. 104\u2013518, p. 111 (1996)). Second, the Court of Appeals\nexpressly limited its holding to \u201cinstances where a peti\ntioner\u201d brings an untimely challenge to \u201csubstantive issues\nrelating to an original order of deferred adjudication pro\nbation.\u201d 429 F. 3d, at 530, n. 24. It did not foreclose\ntimely challenges to such orders, nor did it foreclose timely\nchallenges to the sentencing aspects of the revocation\nproceedings. The Fifth Circuit also did nothing to upset\nthe practice of deferred adjudication probation itself,\nwhich confers considerable benefits upon defendants who\ndo not violate the terms of their probation.* This narrow\nholding is unlikely to produce injustice. Accordingly, the\ndenial of certiorari is appropriate.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * See Davis v. State, 986 S. W. 2d 368, 370 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998) (\u201cA\ndefendant who has been discharged from deferred adjudication [proba\ntion] is immediately eligible to serve on a jury, to vote, and to be rec\nommended for probation by a jury after a finding of guilty at a subse\nquent trial\u201d (footnotes omitted)); Ex parte Laday, 594 S.
