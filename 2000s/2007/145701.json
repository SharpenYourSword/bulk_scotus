Park &amp; Sons Co.,</i> 220 U.S. 373, 31 S.Ct. 376, 55 L.Ed. 502 (1911), the Court established the rule that it is <i>per se</i> illegal under \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, for a manufacturer to agree with its distributor to set the minimum price the distributor can charge for the manufacturer's goods. The question presented by the instant case is whether the Court should overrule the <i>per se</i> rule and allow resale price maintenance agreements to be judged by the rule of reason, the usual standard applied to determine if there is a violation of \u00a7 1. The Court has abandoned the rule of <i>per se</i> illegality for other vertical restraints a manufacturer imposes on its distributors. Respected economic analysts, furthermore, conclude that vertical price restraints can have procompetitive effects. We now hold that <i>Dr. Miles</i> should be overruled and that vertical price restraints are to be judged by the rule of reason.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner, Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. (Leegin), designs, manufactures, and distributes leather goods and accessories. In 1991, Leegin began to sell belts under the brand name \"Brighton.\" The Brighton brand has now expanded into a variety of women's fashion accessories. It is sold across the United States in over 5,000 retail establishments, for the most part independent, small boutiques and specialty stores. Leegin's president, Jerry Kohl, also has an interest in about 70 stores that sell Brighton products. Leegin asserts that, at least for its products, small retailers treat customers better, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2711</span> provide customers more services, and make their shopping experience more satisfactory than do larger, often impersonal retailers. Kohl explained: \"[W]e want the consumers to get a different experience than they get in Sam's Club or in Wal-Mart. And you can't get that kind of experience or support or customer service from a store like Wal-Mart.\" 5 Record 127.</p>\n<p>Respondent, PSKS, Inc. (PSKS), operates Kay's Kloset, a women's apparel store in Lewisville, Texas. Kay's Kloset buys from about 75 different manufacturers and at one time sold the Brighton brand. It first started purchasing Brighton goods from Leegin in 1995. Once it began selling the brand, the store promoted Brighton. For example, it ran Brighton advertisements and had Brighton days in the store. Kay's Kloset became the destination retailer in the area to buy Brighton products. Brighton was the store's most important brand and once accounted for 40 to 50 percent of its profits.</p>\n<p>In 1997, Leegin instituted the \"Brighton Retail Pricing and Promotion Policy.\" 4 <i>id.,</i> at 939. Following the policy, Leegin refused to sell to retailers that discounted Brighton goods below suggested prices. The policy contained an exception for products not selling well that the retailer did not plan on reordering. In the letter to retailers establishing the policy, Leegin stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In this age of mega stores like Macy's, Bloomingdales, May Co. and others, consumers are perplexed by promises of product quality and support of product which we believe is lacking in these large stores. Consumers are further confused by the ever popular sale, sale, sale, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"We, at Leegin, choose to break away from the pack by selling [at] specialty stores; specialty stores that can offer the customer great quality merchandise, superb service, and support the Brighton product 365 days a year on a consistent basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"We realize that half the equation is Leegin producing great Brighton product and the other half is you, our retailer, creating great looking stores selling our products in a quality manner.\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Leegin adopted the policy to give its retailers sufficient margins to provide customers the service central to its distribution strategy. It also expressed concern that discounting harmed Brighton's brand image and reputation.</p>\n<p>A year after instituting the pricing policy Leegin introduced a marketing strategy known as the \"Heart Store Program.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 962-972. It offered retailers incentives to become Heart Stores, and, in exchange, retailers pledged, among other things, to sell at Leegin's suggested prices. Kay's Kloset became a Heart Store soon after Leegin created the program. After a Leegin employee visited the store and found it unattractive, the parties appear to have agreed that Kay's Kloset would not be a Heart Store beyond 1998. Despite losing this status, Kay's Kloset continued to increase its Brighton sales.</p>\n<p>In December 2002, Leegin discovered Kay's Kloset had been marking down Brighton's entire line by 20 percent. Kay's Kloset contended it placed Brighton products on sale to compete with nearby retailers who also were undercutting Leegin's suggested prices. Leegin, nonetheless, requested that Kay's Kloset cease discounting. Its request refused, Leegin stopped selling to the store. The loss of the Brighton brand had a considerable negative impact on the store's revenue from sales.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2712</span> PSKS sued Leegin in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. It alleged, among other claims, that Leegin had violated the antitrust laws by \"enter[ing] into agreements with retailers to charge only those prices fixed by Leegin.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1236. Leegin planned to introduce expert testimony describing the procompetitive effects of its pricing policy. The District Court excluded the testimony, relying on the <i>per se</i> rule established by <i>Dr. Miles.</i> At trial PSKS argued that the Heart Store program, among other things, demonstrated Leegin and its retailers had agreed to fix prices. Leegin responded that it had established a unilateral pricing policy lawful under \u00a7 1, which applies only to concerted action. See <i>United States v. Colgate &amp; Co.,</i> 250 U.S. 300, 307, 39 S.Ct. 465, 63 L.Ed. 992 (1919). The jury agreed with PSKS and awarded it $1.2 million. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a), the District Court trebled the damages and reimbursed PSKS for its attorney's fees and costs. It entered judgment against Leegin in the amount of $3,975,000.80.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 171 Fed.Appx. 464 (2006) <i>(per curiam).</i> On appeal Leegin did not dispute that it had entered into vertical price-fixing agreements with its retailers. Rather, it contended that the rule of reason should have applied to those agreements. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument. <i>Id.,</i> at 466-467. It was correct to explain that it remained bound by <i>Dr. Miles</i> \"[b]ecause [the Supreme] Court has consistently applied the <i>per se</i> rule to [vertical minimum price-fixing] agreements.\" 171 Fed.Appx., at 466. On this premise the Court of Appeals held that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony of Leegin's economic expert, for the <i>per se</i> rule rendered irrelevant any procompetitive justifications for Leegin's pricing policy. <i>Id.,</i> at 467. We granted certiorari to determine whether vertical minimum resale price maintenance agreements should continue to be treated as <i>per se</i> unlawful. 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 763, 166 L.Ed.2d 590 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits \"[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States.\" Ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. While \u00a7 1 could be interpreted to proscribe all contracts, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States,</i> 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S.Ct. 242, 62 L.Ed. 683 (1918), the Court has never \"taken a literal approach to [its] language,\" <i>Texaco Inc. v. Dagher,</i> 547 U.S. 1, 5, 126 S.Ct. 1276, 164 L.Ed.2d 1 (2006). Rather, the Court has repeated time and again that \u00a7 1 \"outlaw[s] only unreasonable restraints.\" <i>State Oil Co. v. Khan,</i> 522 U.S. 3, 10, 118 S.Ct. 275, 139 L.Ed.2d 199 (1997).</p>\n<p>The rule of reason is the accepted standard for testing whether a practice restrains trade in violation of \u00a7 1. See <i>Texaco, supra,</i> at 5, 126 S.Ct. 1276. \"Under this rule, the factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.\" <i>Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.,</i> 433 U.S. 36, 49, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977). Appropriate factors to take into account include \"specific information about the relevant business\" and \"the restraint's history, nature, and effect.\" <i>Khan, supra,</i> at 10, 118 S.Ct. 275. Whether the businesses involved have market power is a further, significant consideration. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.,</i> 467 U.S. 752, 768, 104 S.Ct. 2731, 81 L.Ed.2d 628 (1984) (equating the rule of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2713</span> reason with \"an inquiry into market power and market structure designed to assess [a restraint's] actual effect\"); see also <i>Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc.,</i> 547 U.S. 28, 45-46, 126 S.Ct. 1281, 164 L.Ed.2d 26 (2006). In its design and function the rule distinguishes between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer's best interest.</p>\n<p>The rule of reason does not govern all restraints. Some types \"are deemed unlawful <i>per se.\" </i><i>Khan, supra,</i> at 10, 118 S.Ct. 275. The <i>per se</i> rule, treating categories of restraints as necessarily illegal, eliminates the need to study the reasonableness of an individual restraint in light of the real market forces at work, <i>Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp.,</i> 485 U.S. 717, 723, 108 S.Ct. 1515, 99 L.Ed.2d 808 (1988); and, it must be acknowledged, the <i>per se</i> rule can give clear guidance for certain conduct. Restraints that are <i>per se</i> unlawful include horizontal agreements among competitors to fix prices, see <i>Texaco, supra,</i> at 5, 126 S.Ct. 1276, or to divide markets, see <i>Palmer v. BRG of Ga., Inc.,</i> 498 U.S. 46, 49-50, 111 S.Ct. 401, 112 L.Ed.2d 349 (1990) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>Resort to <i>per se</i> rules is confined to restraints, like those mentioned, \"that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output.\" <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 723, 108 S.Ct. 1515 (internal quotation marks omitted). To justify a <i>per se</i> prohibition a restraint must have \"manifestly anticompetitive\" effects, <i>GTE Sylvania, supra,</i> at 50, 97 S.Ct. 2549, and \"lack ... any redeeming virtue,\" <i>Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery &amp; Printing Co.,</i> 472 U.S. 284, 289, 105 S.Ct. 2613, 86 L.Ed.2d 202 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>As a consequence, the <i>per se</i> rule is appropriate only after courts have had considerable experience with the type of restraint at issue, see <i>Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.,</i> 441 U.S. 1, 9, 99 S.Ct. 1551, 60 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979), and only if courts can predict with confidence that it would be invalidated in all or almost all instances under the rule of reason, see <i>Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc.,</i> 457 U.S. 332, 344, 102 S.Ct. 2466, 73 L.Ed.2d 48 (1982). It should come as no surprise, then, that \"we have expressed reluctance to adopt <i>per se</i> rules with regard to restraints imposed in the context of business relationships where the economic impact of certain practices is not immediately obvious.\" <i>Khan, supra,</i> at 10, 118 S.Ct. 275 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>White Motor Co. v. United States,</i> 372 U.S. 253, 263, 83 S.Ct. 696, 9 L.Ed.2d 738 (1963) (refusing to adopt a <i>per se</i> rule for a vertical nonprice restraint because of the uncertainty concerning whether this type of restraint satisfied the demanding standards necessary to apply a <i>per se</i> rule). And, as we have stated, a \"departure from the rule-of-reason standard must be based upon demonstrable economic effect rather than ... upon formalistic line drawing.\" <i>GTE Sylvania, supra,</i> at 58-59, 97 S.Ct. 2549.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court has interpreted <i>Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co.,</i> 220 U.S. 373, 31 S.Ct. 376, 55 L.Ed. 502 (1911), as establishing a <i>per se</i> rule against a vertical agreement between a manufacturer and its distributor to set minimum resale prices. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp.,</i> 465 U.S. 752, 761, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984). In <i>Dr. Miles</i> the plaintiff, a manufacturer of medicines, sold its products only to distributors <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2714</span> who agreed to resell them at set prices. The Court found the manufacturer's control of resale prices to be unlawful. It relied on the common-law rule that \"a general restraint upon alienation is ordinarily invalid.\" 220 U.S., at 404-405, 31 S.Ct. 376. The Court then explained that the agreements would advantage the distributors, not the manufacturer, and were analogous to a combination among competing distributors, which the law treated as void. <i>Id.,</i> at 407-408, 31 S.Ct. 376.</p>\n<p>The reasoning of the Court's more recent jurisprudence has rejected the rationales on which <i>Dr. Miles</i> was based. By relying on the common-law rule against restraints on alienation, <i>id.,</i> at 404-405, 31 S.Ct. 376, the Court justified its decision based on \"formalistic\" legal doctrine rather than \"demonstrable economic effect,\" <i>GTE Sylvania, supra,</i> at 58-59, 97 S.Ct. 2549. The Court in <i>Dr. Miles</i> relied on a treatise published in 1628, but failed to discuss in detail the business reasons that would motivate a manufacturer situated in 1911 to make use of vertical price restraints. Yet the Sherman Act's use of \"restraint of trade\" \"invokes the common law itself, ... not merely the static content that the common law had assigned to the term in 1890.\" <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 732, 108 S.Ct. 1515. The general restraint on alienation, especially in the age when then-Justice Hughes used the term, tended to evoke policy concerns extraneous to the question that controls here. Usually associated with land, not chattels, the rule arose from restrictions removing real property from the stream of commerce for generations. The Court should be cautious about putting dispositive weight on doctrines from antiquity but of slight relevance. We reaffirm that \"the state of the common law 400 or even 100 years ago is irrelevant to the issue before us: the effect of the antitrust laws upon vertical distributional restraints in the American economy today.\" <i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 53, n. 21, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p><i>Dr. Miles,</i> furthermore, treated vertical agreements a manufacturer makes with its distributors as analogous to a horizontal combination among competing distributors. See 220 U.S., at 407-408, 31 S.Ct. 376. In later cases, however, the Court rejected the approach of reliance on rules governing horizontal restraints when defining rules applicable to vertical ones. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 734, 108 S.Ct. 1515 (disclaiming the \"notion of equivalence between the scope of horizontal <i>per se</i> illegality and that of vertical <i>per se</i> illegality\"); <i>Maricopa County, supra,</i> at 348, n. 18, 102 S.Ct. 2466 (noting that \"horizontal restraints are generally less defensible than vertical restraints\"). Our recent cases formulate antitrust principles in accordance with the appreciated differences in economic effect between vertical and horizontal agreements, differences the <i>Dr. Miles</i> Court failed to consider.</p>\n<p>The reasons upon which <i>Dr. Miles</i> relied do not justify a <i>per se</i> rule. As a consequence, it is necessary to examine, in the first instance, the economic effects of vertical agreements to fix minimum resale prices, and to determine whether the <i>per se</i> rule is nonetheless appropriate. See <i>Business Electronics,</i> 485 U.S., at 726, 108 S.Ct. 1515.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Though each side of the debate can find sources to support its position, it suffices to say here that economics literature is replete with procompetitive justifications for a manufacturer's use of resale price maintenance. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Economists as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 16 (\"In the theoretical literature, it is essentially undisputed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2715</span> that minimum [resale price maintenance] can have procompetitive effects and that under a variety of market conditions it is unlikely to have anticompetitive effects\"); Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 9 (\"[T]here is a widespread consensus that permitting a manufacturer to control the price at which its goods are sold may promote <i>inter</i>brand competition and consumer welfare in a variety of ways\"); ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law and Economics of Product Distribution 76 (2006) (\"[T]he bulk of the economic literature on [resale price maintenance] suggests that [it] is more likely to be used to enhance efficiency than for anticompetitive purposes\"); see also H. Hovenkamp, The Antitrust Enterprise: Principle and Execution 184-191 (2005) (hereinafter Hovenkamp); R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 288-291 (1978) (hereinafter Bork). Even those more skeptical of resale price maintenance acknowledge it can have procompetitive effects. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for William S. Comanor et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 3 (\"[G]iven [the] diversity of effects [of resale price maintenance], one could reasonably take the position that a <i>rule of reason</i> rather than a <i>per se</i> approach is warranted\"); F.M. Scherer &amp; D. Ross, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 558 (3d ed.1990) (hereinafter Scherer &amp; Ross) (\"The overall balance between benefits and costs [of resale price maintenance] is probably close\").</p>\n<p>The few recent studies documenting the competitive effects of resale price maintenance also cast doubt on the conclusion that the practice meets the criteria for a <i>per se</i> rule. See T. Overstreet, Resale Price Maintenance: Economic Theories and Empirical Evidence 170 (1983) (hereinafter Overstreet) (noting that \"[e]fficient uses of [resale price maintenance] are evidently not unusual or rare\"); see also Ippolito, Resale Price Maintenance: Empirical Evidence From Litigation, 34 J. Law &amp; Econ. 263, 292-293 (1991) (hereinafter Ippolito).</p>\n<p>The justifications for vertical price restraints are similar to those for other vertical restraints. See <i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 54-57, 97 S.Ct. 2549. Minimum resale price maintenance can stimulate interbrand competition\u0097the competition among manufacturers selling different brands of the same type of product\u0097by reducing intrabrand competition\u0097the competition among retailers selling the same brand. See <i>id.,</i> at 51-52, 97 S.Ct. 2549. The promotion of interbrand competition is important because \"the primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect [this type of] competition.\" <i>Khan,</i> 522 U.S., at 15, 118 S.Ct. 275. A single manufacturer's use of vertical price restraints tends to eliminate intrabrand price competition; this in turn encourages retailers to invest in tangible or intangible services or promotional efforts that aid the manufacturer's position as against rival manufacturers. Resale price maintenance also has the potential to give consumers more options so that they can choose among low-price, low-service brands; high-price, high-service brands; and brands that fall in between.</p>\n<p>Absent vertical price restraints, the retail services that enhance interbrand competition might be underprovided. This is because discounting retailers can free ride on retailers who furnish services and then capture some of the increased demand those services generate. <i>GTE Sylvania, supra,</i> at 55, 97 S.Ct. 2549. Consumers might learn, for example, about the benefits of a manufacturer's product from a retailer that invests in fine showrooms, offers product demonstrations, or hires and trains knowledgeable employees. R. Posner, Antitrust Law 172-173 (2d ed.2001) (hereinafter Posner). Or consumers might decide to buy the product because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2716</span> they see it in a retail establishment that has a reputation for selling high-quality merchandise. Marvel &amp; McCafferty, Resale Price Maintenance and Quality Certification, 15 Rand J. Econ. 346, 347-349 (1984) (hereinafter Marvel &amp; McCafferty). If the consumer can then buy the product from a retailer that discounts because it has not spent capital providing services or developing a quality reputation, the high-service retailer will lose sales to the discounter, forcing it to cut back its services to a level lower than consumers would otherwise prefer. Minimum resale price maintenance alleviates the problem because it prevents the discounter from undercutting the service provider. With price competition decreased, the manufacturer's retailers compete among themselves over services.</p>\n<p>Resale price maintenance, in addition, can increase interbrand competition by facilitating market entry for new firms and brands. \"[N]ew manufacturers and manufacturers entering new markets can use the restrictions in order to induce competent and aggressive retailers to make the kind of investment of capital and labor that is often required in the distribution of products unknown to the consumer.\" <i>GTE Sylvania, supra,</i> at 55, 97 S.Ct. 2549; see Marvel &amp; McCafferty 349 (noting that reliance on a retailer's reputation \"will decline as the manufacturer's brand becomes better known, so that [resale price maintenance] may be particularly important as a competitive device for new entrants\"). New products and new brands are essential to a dynamic economy, and if markets can be penetrated by using resale price maintenance there is a procompetitive effect.</p>\n<p>Resale price maintenance can also increase interbrand competition by encouraging retailer services that would not be provided even absent free riding. It may be difficult and inefficient for a manufacturer to make and enforce a contract with a retailer specifying the different services the retailer must perform. Offering the retailer a guaranteed margin and threatening termination if it does not live up to expectations may be the most efficient way to expand the manufacturer's market share by inducing the retailer's performance and allowing it to use its own initiative and experience in providing valuable services. See Mathewson &amp; Winter, The Law and Economics of Resale Price Maintenance, 13 Rev. Indus. Org. 57, 74-75 (1998) (hereinafter Mathewson &amp; Winter); Klein &amp; Murphy, Vertical Restraints as Contract Enforcement Mechanisms, 31 J. Law &amp; Econ. 265, 295 (1988); see also Deneckere, Marvel, &amp; Peck, Demand Uncertainty, Inventories, and Resale Price Maintenance, 111 Q.J. Econ. 885, 911 (1996) (noting that resale price maintenance may be beneficial to motivate retailers to stock adequate inventories of a manufacturer's goods in the face of uncertain consumer demand).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>While vertical agreements setting minimum resale prices can have procompetitive justifications, they may have anticompetitive effects in other cases; and unlawful price fixing, designed solely to obtain monopoly profits, is an ever present temptation. Resale price maintenance may, for example, facilitate a manufacturer cartel. See <i>Business Electronics,</i> 485 U.S., at 725, 108 S.Ct. 1515. An unlawful cartel will seek to discover if some manufacturers are undercutting the cartel's fixed prices. Resale price maintenance could assist the cartel in identifying price-cutting manufacturers who benefit from the lower prices they offer. Resale price maintenance, furthermore, could discourage a manufacturer from cutting prices to retailers with the concomitant benefit of cheaper prices to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2717</span> consumers. See <i>ibid.;</i> see also Posner 172; Overstreet 19-23.</p>\n<p>Vertical price restraints also \"might be used to organize cartels at the retailer level.\" <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 725-726, 108 S.Ct. 1515. A group of retailers might collude to fix prices to consumers and then compel a manufacturer to aid the unlawful arrangement with resale price maintenance. In that instance the manufacturer does not establish the practice to stimulate services or to promote its brand but to give inefficient retailers higher profits. Retailers with better distribution systems and lower cost structures would be prevented from charging lower prices by the agreement. See Posner 172; Overstreet 13-19. Historical examples suggest this possibility is a legitimate concern. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Marvel &amp; McCafferty, The Welfare Effects of Resale Price Maintenance, 28 J. Law &amp; Econ. 363, 373 (1985) (hereinafter Marvel) (providing an example of the power of the National Association of Retail Druggists to compel manufacturers to use resale price maintenance); Hovenkamp 186 (suggesting that the retail druggists in <i>Dr. Miles</i> formed a cartel and used manufacturers to enforce it).</p>\n<p>A horizontal cartel among competing manufacturers or competing retailers that decreases output or reduces competition in order to increase price is, and ought to be, <i>per se</i> unlawful. See <i>Texaco,</i> 547 U.S., at 5, 126 S.Ct. 1276; <i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 58, n. 28, 97 S.Ct. 2549. To the extent a vertical agreement setting minimum resale prices is entered upon to facilitate either type of cartel, it, too, would need to be held unlawful under the rule of reason. This type of agreement may also be useful evidence for a plaintiff attempting to prove the existence of a horizontal cartel.</p>\n<p>Resale price maintenance, furthermore, can be abused by a powerful manufacturer or retailer. A dominant retailer, for example, might request resale price maintenance to forestall innovation in distribution that decreases costs. A manufacturer might consider it has little choice but to accommodate the retailer's demands for vertical price restraints if the manufacturer believes it needs access to the retailer's distribution network. See Overstreet 31; 8 P. Areeda &amp; H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law 47 (2d ed.2004) (hereinafter Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp); cf. <i>Toys \"R\" Us, Inc. v. FTC,</i> 221 F.3d 928, 937-938 (C.A.7 2000). A manufacturer with market power, by comparison, might use resale price maintenance to give retailers an incentive not to sell the products of smaller rivals or new entrants. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Marvel 366-368. As should be evident, the potential anticompetitive consequences of vertical price restraints must not be ignored or underestimated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Notwithstanding the risks of unlawful conduct, it cannot be stated with any degree of confidence that resale price maintenance \"always or almost always tend[s] to restrict competition and decrease output.\" <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 723, 108 S.Ct. 1515 (internal quotation marks omitted). Vertical agreements establishing minimum resale prices can have either procompetitive or anticompetitive effects, depending upon the circumstances in which they are formed. And although the empirical evidence on the topic is limited, it does not suggest efficient uses of the agreements are infrequent or hypothetical. See Overstreet 170; see also <i>id.,</i> at 80 (noting that for the majority of enforcement actions brought by the Federal Trade Commission between 1965 and 1982, \"the use of [resale price maintenance] was not likely motivated by collusive dealers who had successfully coerced their suppliers\"); Ippolito 292 (reaching a similar conclusion). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2718</span> As the rule would proscribe a significant amount of procompetitive conduct, these agreements appear ill suited for <i>per se</i> condemnation.</p>\n<p>Respondent contends, nonetheless, that vertical price restraints should be <i>per se</i> unlawful because of the administrative convenience of <i>per se</i> rules. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>GTE Sylvania, supra,</i> at 50, n. 16, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (noting \"<i>per se</i> rules tend to provide guidance to the business community and to minimize the burdens on litigants and the judicial system\"). That argument suggests <i>per se</i> illegality is the rule rather than the exception. This misinterprets our antitrust law. <i>Per se</i> rules may decrease administrative costs, but that is only part of the equation. Those rules can be counterproductive. They can increase the total cost of the antitrust system by prohibiting procompetitive conduct the antitrust laws should encourage. See Easterbrook, Vertical Arrangements and the Rule of Reason, 53 Antitrust L.J. 135, 158 (1984) (hereinafter Easterbrook). They also may increase litigation costs by promoting frivolous suits against legitimate practices. The Court has thus explained that administrative \"advantages are not sufficient in themselves to justify the creation of <i>per se</i> rules,\" <i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 50, n. 16, 97 S.Ct. 2549, and has relegated their use to restraints that are \"manifestly anticompetitive,\" <i>id.,</i> at 49-50, 97 S.Ct. 2549. Were the Court now to conclude that vertical price restraints should be <i>per se</i> illegal based on administrative costs, we would undermine, if not overrule, the traditional \"demanding standards\" for adopting <i>per se</i> rules. <i>Id.,</i> at 50, 97 S.Ct. 2549. Any possible reduction in administrative costs cannot alone justify the <i>Dr. Miles</i> rule.</p>\n<p>Respondent also argues the <i>per se</i> rule is justified because a vertical price restraint can lead to higher prices for the manufacturer's goods. See also Overstreet 160 (noting that \"price surveys indicate that [resale price maintenance] in most cases increased the prices of products sold\"). Respondent is mistaken in relying on pricing effects absent a further showing of anticompetitive conduct. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 106 (explaining that price surveys \"do not necessarily tell us anything conclusive about the welfare effects of [resale price maintenance] because the results are generally consistent with both procompetitive and anticompetitive theories\"). For, as has been indicated already, the antitrust laws are designed primarily to protect interbrand competition, from which lower prices can later result. See <i>Khan,</i> 522 U.S., at 15, 118 S.Ct. 275. The Court, moreover, has evaluated other vertical restraints under the rule of reason even though prices can be increased in the course of promoting procompetitive effects. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Business Electronics,</i> 485 U.S., at 728, 108 S.Ct. 1515. And resale price maintenance may reduce prices if manufacturers have resorted to costlier alternatives of controlling resale prices that are not <i>per se</i> unlawful. See <i>infra,</i> at 2721-2724; see also Marvel 371.</p>\n<p>Respondent's argument, furthermore, overlooks that, in general, the interests of manufacturers and consumers are aligned with respect to retailer profit margins. The difference between the price a manufacturer charges retailers and the price retailers charge consumers represents part of the manufacturer's cost of distribution, which, like any other cost, the manufacturer usually desires to minimize. See <i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 56, n. 24, 97 S.Ct. 2549; see also <i>id.,</i> at 56, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (\"Economists ... have argued that manufacturers have an economic interest in maintaining as much intrabrand competition as is consistent with the efficient distribution of their products\"). A manufacturer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2719</span> has no incentive to overcompensate retailers with unjustified margins. The retailers, not the manufacturer, gain from higher retail prices. The manufacturer often loses; interbrand competition reduces its competitiveness and market share because consumers will \"substitute a different brand of the same product.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 52, n. 19, 97 S.Ct. 2549; see <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 725, 108 S.Ct. 1515. As a general matter, therefore, a single manufacturer will desire to set minimum resale prices only if the \"increase in demand resulting from enhanced service ... will more than offset a negative impact on demand of a higher retail price.\" Mathewson &amp; Winter 67.</p>\n<p>The implications of respondent's position are far reaching. Many decisions a manufacturer makes and carries out through concerted action can lead to higher prices. A manufacturer might, for example, contract with different suppliers to obtain better inputs that improve product quality. Or it might hire an advertising agency to promote awareness of its goods. Yet no one would think these actions violate the Sherman Act because they lead to higher prices. The antitrust laws do not require manufacturers to produce generic goods that consumers do not know about or want. The manufacturer strives to improve its product quality or to promote its brand because it believes this conduct will lead to increased demand despite higher prices. The same can hold true for resale price maintenance.</p>\n<p>Resale price maintenance, it is true, does have economic dangers. If the rule of reason were to apply to vertical price restraints, courts would have to be diligent in eliminating their anticompetitive uses from the market. This is a realistic objective, and certain factors are relevant to the inquiry. For example, the number of manufacturers that make use of the practice in a given industry can provide important instruction. When only a few manufacturers lacking market power adopt the practice, there is little likelihood it is facilitating a manufacturer cartel, for a cartel then can be undercut by rival manufacturers. See Overstreet 22; Bork 294. Likewise, a retailer cartel is unlikely when only a single manufacturer in a competitive market uses resale price maintenance. Interbrand competition would divert consumers to lower priced substitutes and eliminate any gains to retailers from their price-fixing agreement over a single brand. See Posner 172; Bork 292. Resale price maintenance should be subject to more careful scrutiny, by contrast, if many competing manufacturers adopt the practice. Cf. Scherer &amp; Ross 558 (noting that \"except when [resale price maintenance] spreads to cover the bulk of an industry's output, depriving consumers of a meaningful choice between high-service and low-price outlets, most [resale price maintenance arrangements] are probably innocuous\"); Easterbrook 162 (suggesting that \"every one of the potentially-anticompetitive outcomes of vertical arrangements depends on the uniformity of the practice\").</p>\n<p>The source of the restraint may also be an important consideration. If there is evidence retailers were the impetus for a vertical price restraint, there is a greater likelihood that the restraint facilitates a retailer cartel or supports a dominant, inefficient retailer. See Brief for William S. Comanor et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7-8. If, by contrast, a manufacturer adopted the policy independent of retailer pressure, the restraint is less likely to promote anticompetitive conduct. Cf. Posner 177 (\"It makes all the difference whether minimum retail prices are imposed by the manufacturer in order to evoke point-of-sale services or by the dealers in order to obtain monopoly profits\"). A manufacturer also has an incentive to protest inefficient retailer-induced <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2720</span> price restraints because they can harm its competitive position.</p>\n<p>As a final matter, that a dominant manufacturer or retailer can abuse resale price maintenance for anticompetitive purposes may not be a serious concern unless the relevant entity has market power. If a retailer lacks market power, manufacturers likely can sell their goods through rival retailers. See also <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 727, n. 2, 108 S.Ct. 1515 (noting \"[r]etail market power is rare, because of the usual presence of interbrand competition and other dealers\"). And if a manufacturer lacks market power, there is less likelihood it can use the practice to keep competitors away from distribution outlets.</p>\n<p>The rule of reason is designed and used to eliminate anticompetitive transactions from the market. This standard principle applies to vertical price restraints. A party alleging injury from a vertical agreement setting minimum resale prices will have, as a general matter, the information and resources available to show the existence of the agreement and its scope of operation. As courts gain experience considering the effects of these restraints by applying the rule of reason over the course of decisions, they can establish the litigation structure to ensure the rule operates to eliminate anticompetitive restraints from the market and to provide more guidance to businesses. Courts can, for example, devise rules over time for offering proof, or even presumptions where justified, to make the rule of reason a fair and efficient way to prohibit anticompetitive restraints and to promote procompetitive ones.</p>\n<p>For all of the foregoing reasons, we think that were the Court considering the issue as an original matter, the rule of reason, not a <i>per se</i> rule of unlawfulness, would be the appropriate standard to judge vertical price restraints.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>We do not write on a clean slate, for the decision in <i>Dr. Miles</i> is almost a century old. So there is an argument for its retention on the basis of <i>stare decisis</i> alone. Even if <i>Dr. Miles</i> established an erroneous rule, \"<i>[s]tare decisis</i> reflects a policy judgment that in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.\" <i>Khan,</i> 522 U.S., at 20, 118 S.Ct. 275 (internal quotation marks omitted). And concerns about maintaining settled law are strong when the question is one of statutory interpretation. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Hohn v. United States,</i> 524 U.S. 236, 251, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998).</p>\n<p><i>Stare decisis</i> is not as significant in this case, however, because the issue before us is the scope of the Sherman Act. <i>Khan, supra,</i> at 20, 118 S.Ct. 275 (\"[T]he general presumption that legislative changes should be left to Congress has less force with respect to the Sherman Act\"). From the beginning the Court has treated the Sherman Act as a common-law statute. See <i>National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States,</i> 435 U.S. 679, 688, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978); see also <i>Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers,</i> 451 U.S. 77, 98, n. 42, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981) (\"In antitrust, the federal courts ... act more as common-law courts than in other areas governed by federal statute\"). Just as the common law adapts to modern understanding and greater experience, so too does the Sherman Act's prohibition on \"restraint[s] of trade\" evolve to meet the dynamics of present economic conditions. The case-by-case adjudication contemplated by the rule of reason has implemented this common-law approach. See <i>National Soc. of Professional Engineers, supra,</i> at 688, 98 S.Ct. 1355. Likewise, the boundaries of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2721</span> the doctrine of <i>per se</i> illegality should not be immovable. For \"[i]t would make no sense to create out of the single term `restraint of trade' a chronologically schizoid statute, in which a `rule of reason' evolves with new circumstance and new wisdom, but a line of <i>per se</i> illegality remains forever fixed where it was.\" <i>Business Electronics,</i> 485 U.S., at 732, 108 S.Ct. 1515.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p><i>Stare decisis,</i> we conclude, does not compel our continued adherence to the <i>per se</i> rule against vertical price restraints. As discussed earlier, respected authorities in the economics literature suggest the <i>per se</i> rule is inappropriate, and there is now widespread agreement that resale price maintenance can have procompetitive effects. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Economists as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 16. It is also significant that both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission\u0097the antitrust enforcement agencies with the ability to assess the long-term impacts of resale price maintenance\u0097have recommended that this Court replace the <i>per se</i> rule with the traditional rule of reason. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 6. In the antitrust context the fact that a decision has been \"called into serious question\" justifies our reevaluation of it. <i>Khan, supra,</i> at 21, 118 S.Ct. 275.</p>\n<p>Other considerations reinforce the conclusion that <i>Dr. Miles</i> should be overturned. Of most relevance, \"we have overruled our precedents when subsequent cases have undermined their doctrinal underpinnings.\" <i>Dickerson v. United States,</i> 530 U.S. 428, 443, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000). The Court's treatment of vertical restraints has progressed away from <i>Dr. Miles</i>' strict approach. We have distanced ourselves from the opinion's rationales. See <i>supra,</i> at 2713-2714; see also <i>Khan, supra,</i> at 21, 118 S.Ct. 275 (overruling a case when \"the views underlying [it had been] eroded by this Court's precedent\"); <i>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,</i> 490 U.S. 477, 480-481, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989) (same). This is unsurprising, for the case was decided not long after enactment of the Sherman Act when the Court had little experience with antitrust analysis. Only eight years after <i>Dr. Miles,</i> moreover, the Court reined in the decision by holding that a manufacturer can announce suggested resale prices and refuse to deal with distributors who do not follow them. <i>Colgate,</i> 250 U.S., at 307-308, 39 S.Ct. 465.</p>\n<p>In more recent cases the Court, following a common-law approach, has continued to temper, limit, or overrule once strict prohibitions on vertical restraints. In 1977, the Court overturned the <i>per se</i> rule for vertical nonprice restraints, adopting the rule of reason in its stead. <i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 57-59, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (overruling <i>United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.,</i> 388 U.S. 365, 87 S.Ct. 1856, 18 L.Ed.2d 1249 (1967)); see also 433 U.S., at 58, n. 29, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (noting \"that the advantages of vertical restrictions should not be limited to the categories of new entrants and failing firms\"). While the Court in a footnote in <i>GTE Sylvania</i> suggested that differences between vertical price and nonprice restraints could support different legal treatment, see 433 U.S., at 51, n. 18, 97 S.Ct. 2549, the central part of the opinion relied on authorities and arguments that find unequal treatment \"difficult to justify,\" <i>id.,</i> at 69-70, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (White, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>Continuing in this direction, in two cases in the 1980's the Court defined legal rules to limit the reach of <i>Dr. Miles</i> and to accommodate the doctrines enunciated in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2722</span> <i>GTE Sylvania</i> and <i>Colgate.</i> See <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 726-728, 108 S.Ct. 1515; <i>Monsanto,</i> 465 U.S., at 763-764, 104 S.Ct. 1464. In <i>Monsanto,</i> the Court required that antitrust plaintiffs alleging a \u00a7 1 price-fixing conspiracy must present evidence tending to exclude the possibility a manufacturer and its distributors acted in an independent manner. <i>Id.,</i> at 764, 104 S.Ct. 1464. Unlike Justice Brennan's concurrence, which rejected arguments that <i>Dr. Miles</i> should be overruled, see 465 U.S., at 769, 104 S.Ct. 1464, the Court \"decline[d] to reach the question\" whether vertical agreements fixing resale prices always should be unlawful because neither party suggested otherwise, <i>id.,</i> at 761-762, n. 7, 104 S.Ct. 1464. In <i>Business Electronics</i> the Court further narrowed the scope of <i>Dr. Miles.</i> It held that the <i>per se</i> rule applied only to specific agreements over price levels and not to an agreement between a manufacturer and a distributor to terminate a price-cutting distributor. 485 U.S., at 726-727, 735-736, 108 S.Ct. 1515.</p>\n<p>Most recently, in 1997, after examining the issue of vertical maximum price-fixing agreements in light of commentary and real experience, the Court overruled a 29-year-old precedent treating those agreements as <i>per se</i> illegal. <i>Khan,</i> 522 U.S., at 22, 118 S.Ct. 275 (overruling <i>Albrecht v. Herald Co.,</i> 390 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 869, 19 L.Ed.2d 998 (1968)). It held instead that they should be evaluated under the traditional rule of reason. 522 U.S., at 22, 118 S.Ct. 275. Our continued limiting of the reach of the decision in <i>Dr. Miles</i> and our recent treatment of other vertical restraints justify the conclusion that <i>Dr. Miles</i> should not be retained.</p>\n<p>The <i>Dr. Miles</i> rule is also inconsistent with a principled framework, for it makes little economic sense when analyzed with our other cases on vertical restraints. If we were to decide the procompetitive effects of resale price maintenance were insufficient to overrule <i>Dr. Miles,</i> then cases such as <i>Colgate</i> and <i>GTE Sylvania</i> themselves would be called into question. These later decisions, while they may result in less intrabrand competition, can be justified because they permit manufacturers to secure the procompetitive benefits associated with vertical price restraints through other methods. The other methods, however, could be less efficient for a particular manufacturer to establish and sustain. The end result hinders competition and consumer welfare because manufacturers are forced to engage in second-best alternatives and because consumers are required to shoulder the increased expense of the inferior practices.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer has a number of legitimate options to achieve benefits similar to those provided by vertical price restraints. A manufacturer can exercise its <i>Colgate</i> right to refuse to deal with retailers that do not follow its suggested prices. See 250 U.S., at 307, 39 S.Ct. 465. The economic effects of unilateral and concerted price setting are in general the same. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Monsanto,</i> 465 U.S., at 762-764, 104 S.Ct. 1464. The problem for the manufacturer is that a jury might conclude its unilateral policy was really a vertical agreement, subjecting it to treble damages and potential criminal liability. <i>Ibid.; </i><i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 728, 108 S.Ct. 1515. Even with the stringent standards in <i>Monsanto</i> and <i>Business Electronics,</i> this danger can lead, and has led, rational manufacturers to take wasteful measures. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for PING, Inc., as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 9-18. A manufacturer might refuse to discuss its pricing policy with its distributors except through counsel knowledgeable of the subtle intricacies of the law. Or it might terminate longstanding distributors for minor violations without seeking an explanation. See <i>ibid.</i> The increased costs these burdensome <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2723</span> measures generate flow to consumers in the form of higher prices.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, depending on the type of product it sells, a manufacturer might be able to achieve the procompetitive benefits of resale price maintenance by integrating downstream and selling its products directly to consumers. <i>Dr. Miles</i> tilts the relative costs of vertical integration and vertical agreement by making the former more attractive based on the <i>per se</i> rule, not on real market conditions. See <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 725, 108 S.Ct. 1515; see generally Coase, The Nature of the Firm, 4 Economica, New Series 386 (1937). This distortion might lead to inefficient integration that would not otherwise take place, so that consumers must again suffer the consequences of the suboptimal distribution strategy. And integration, unlike vertical price restraints, eliminates all intrabrand competition. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 57, n. 26, 97 S.Ct. 2549.</p>\n<p>There is yet another consideration. A manufacturer can impose territorial restrictions on distributors and allow only one distributor to sell its goods in a given region. Our cases have recognized, and the economics literature confirms, that these vertical nonprice restraints have impacts similar to those of vertical price restraints; both reduce intrabrand competition and can stimulate retailer services. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 728, 108 S.Ct. 1515; <i>Monsanto, supra,</i> at 762-763, 104 S.Ct. 1464; see also Brief for Economists as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 17-18. Cf. Scherer &amp; Ross 560 (noting that vertical nonprice restraints \"can engender inefficiencies at least as serious as those imposed upon the consumer by resale price maintenance\"); Steiner, How Manufacturers Deal with the Price-Cutting Retailer: When Are Vertical Restraints Efficient?, 65 Antitrust L.J. 407, 446-447 (1997) (indicating that \"antitrust law should recognize that the consumer interest is often better served by [resale price maintenance]\u0097contrary to its per se illegality and the rule-of-reason status of vertical nonprice restraints\"). The same legal standard (<i>per se</i> unlawfulness) applies to horizontal market division and horizontal price fixing because both have similar economic effect. There is likewise little economic justification for the current differential treatment of vertical price and nonprice restraints. Furthermore, vertical nonprice restraints may prove less efficient for inducing desired services, and they reduce intrabrand competition more than vertical price restraints by eliminating both price and service competition. See Brief for Economists as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 17-18.</p>\n<p>In sum, it is a flawed antitrust doctrine that serves the interests of lawyers\u0097by creating legal distinctions that operate as traps for the unwary\u0097more than the interests of consumers\u0097by requiring manufacturers to choose second-best options to achieve sound business objectives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondent's arguments for reaffirming <i>Dr. Miles</i> on the basis of <i>stare decisis</i> do not require a different result. Respondent looks to congressional action concerning vertical price restraints. In 1937, Congress passed the Miller-Tydings Fair Trade Act, 50 Stat. 693, which made vertical price restraints legal if authorized by a fair trade law enacted by a State. Fifteen years later, Congress expanded the exemption to permit vertical price-setting agreements between a manufacturer and a distributor to be enforced against other distributors not involved in the agreement. McGuire Act, 66 Stat. 632. In 1975, however, Congress repealed both Acts. Consumer Goods Pricing Act, 89 Stat. 801. That the <i>Dr. Miles</i> rule applied to vertical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2724</span> price restraints in 1975, according to respondent, shows Congress ratified the rule.</p>\n<p>This is not so. The text of the Consumer Goods Pricing Act did not codify the rule of <i>per se</i> illegality for vertical price restraints. It rescinded statutory provisions that made them <i>per se</i> legal. Congress once again placed these restraints within the ambit of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act. And, as has been discussed, Congress intended \u00a7 1 to give courts the ability \"to develop governing principles of law\" in the common-law tradition. <i>Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc.,</i> 451 U.S. 630, 643, 101 S.Ct. 2061, 68 L.Ed.2d 500 (1981); see <i>Business Electronics,</i> 485 U.S., at 731, 108 S.Ct. 1515 (\"The changing content of the term `restraint of trade' was well recognized at the time the Sherman Act was enacted\"). Congress could have set the <i>Dr. Miles</i> rule in stone, but it chose a more flexible option. We respect its decision by analyzing vertical price restraints, like all restraints, in conformance with traditional \u00a7 1 principles, including the principle that our antitrust doctrines \"evolv[e] with new circumstances and new wisdom.\" <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 732, 108 S.Ct. 1515; see also Easterbrook 139.</p>\n<p>The rule of reason, furthermore, is not inconsistent with the Consumer Goods Pricing Act. Unlike the earlier congressional exemption, it does not treat vertical price restraints as <i>per se</i> legal. In this respect, the justifications for the prior exemption are illuminating. Its goal \"was to allow the States to protect small retail establishments that Congress thought might otherwise be driven from the marketplace by large-volume discounters.\" <i>California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,</i> 445 U.S. 97, 102, 100 S.Ct. 937, 63 L.Ed.2d 233 (1980). The state fair trade laws also appear to have been justified on similar grounds. See Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp 298. The rationales for these provisions are foreign to the Sherman Act. Divorced from competition and consumer welfare, they were designed to save inefficient small retailers from their inability to compete. The purpose of the antitrust laws, by contrast, is \"the protection of <i>competition,</i> not <i>competitors.</i>\" <i>Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co.,</i> 495 U.S. 328, 338, 110 S.Ct. 1884, 109 L.Ed.2d 333 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). To the extent Congress repealed the exemption for some vertical price restraints to end its prior practice of encouraging anticompetitive conduct, the rule of reason promotes the same objective.</p>\n<p>Respondent also relies on several congressional appropriations in the mid-1980's in which Congress did not permit the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission to use funds to advocate overturning <i>Dr. Miles.</i> See, <i>e.g.,</i> 97 Stat. 1071. We need not pause long in addressing this argument. The conditions on funding are no longer in place, see, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 21, and they were ambiguous at best. As much as they might show congressional approval for <i>Dr. Miles,</i> they might demonstrate a different proposition: that Congress could not pass legislation codifying the rule and reached a short-term compromise instead.</p>\n<p>Reliance interests do not require us to reaffirm <i>Dr. Miles.</i> To be sure, reliance on a judicial opinion is a significant reason to adhere to it, <i>Payne v.

The reliance interests here, however, like the reliance interests in <i>Khan,</i> cannot justify an inefficient rule, especially because the narrowness of the rule has allowed manufacturers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2725</span> to set minimum resale prices in other ways. And while the <i>Dr. Miles</i> rule is longstanding, resale price maintenance was legal under fair trade laws in a majority of States for a large part of the past century up until 1975.</p>\n<p>It is also of note that during this time \"when the legal environment in the [United States] was most favorable for [resale price maintenance], no more than a tiny fraction of manufacturers ever employed [resale price maintenance] contracts.\" Overstreet 6; see also <i>id.,</i> at 169 (noting that \"no more than one percent of manufacturers, accounting for no more than ten percent of consumer goods purchases, ever employed [resale price maintenance] in any single year in the [United States]\"); Scherer &amp; Ross 549 (noting that \"[t]he fraction of U.S. retail sales covered by [resale price maintenance] in its heyday has been variously estimated at from 4 to 10 percent\"). To the extent consumers demand cheap goods, judging vertical price restraints under the rule of reason will not prevent the market from providing them. Cf. Easterbrook 152-153 (noting that \"S.S. Kresge (the old K-Mart) flourished during the days of manufacturers' greatest freedom\" because \"discount stores offer a combination of price and service that many customers value\" and that \"[n]othing in restricted dealing threatens the ability of consumers to find low prices\"); Scherer &amp; Ross 557 (noting that \"for the most part, the effects of the [Consumer Goods Pricing Act] were imperceptible because the forces of competition had already repealed the [previous antitrust exemption] in their own quiet way\").</p>\n<p>For these reasons the Court's decision in <i>Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co.,</i> 220 U.S. 373, 31 S.Ct. 376, 55 L.Ed. 502 (1911), is now overruled. Vertical price restraints are to be judged according to the rule of reason.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Noting that Leegin's president has an ownership interest in retail stores that sell Brighton, respondent claims Leegin participated in an unlawful horizontal cartel with competing retailers.

John D. Park &amp; Sons Co.,</i> 220 U.S. 373, 394, 408-409, 31 S.Ct. 376, 55 L.Ed. 502 (1911), this Court held that an agreement between a manufacturer of proprietary medicines and its dealers to fix the minimum price at which its medicines could be sold was \"invalid... under the [Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1].\" This Court has consistently read <i>Dr. Miles</i> as establishing a bright-line rule that agreements fixing minimum resale prices are <i>per se</i> illegal. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Trenton Potteries Co.,</i> 273 U.S. 392, 399-401, 47 S.Ct. 377, 71 L.Ed. 700 (1927); <i>NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc.,</i> 525 U.S. 128, 133, 119 S.Ct. 493, 142 L.Ed.2d 510 (1998). That <i>per se</i> rule is one upon which the legal profession, business, and the public have relied for close to a century. Today the Court holds that courts must determine the lawfulness of minimum resale price maintenance by applying, not a bright-line <i>per se</i> rule, but a circumstance-specific \"rule of reason.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2725. And in doing so it overturns <i>Dr. Miles.</i></p>\n<p>The Court justifies its departure from ordinary considerations of <i>stare decisis</i> by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2726</span> pointing to a set of arguments well known in the antitrust literature for close to half a century. See <i>ante,</i> at 2715-2716. Congress has repeatedly found in these arguments insufficient grounds for overturning the <i>per se</i> rule. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Hearings on H.R. 10527 et al. before the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 74-76, 89, 99, 101-102, 192-195, 261-262 (1958). And, in my view, they do not warrant the Court's now overturning so well-established a legal precedent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Sherman Act seeks to maintain a marketplace free of anticompetitive practices, in particular those enforced by agreement among private firms. The law assumes that such a marketplace, free of private restrictions, will tend to bring about the lower prices, better products, and more efficient production processes that consumers typically desire. In determining the lawfulness of particular practices, courts often apply a \"rule of reason.\" They examine both a practice's likely anticompetitive effects and its beneficial business justifications. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla.,</i> 468 U.S. 85, 109-110, and n. 39, 104 S.Ct. 2948, 82 L.Ed.2d 70 (1984); <i>National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States,</i> 435 U.S. 679, 688-691, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978); <i>Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States,</i> 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S.Ct. 242, 62 L.Ed. 683 (1918).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, sometimes the likely anticompetitive consequences of a particular practice are so serious and the potential justifications so few (or, <i>e.g.,</i> so difficult to prove) that courts have departed from a pure \"rule of reason\" approach. And sometimes this Court has imposed a rule of <i>per se</i> unlawfulness\u0097a rule that instructs courts to find the practice unlawful all (or nearly all) the time. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>NYNEX, supra,</i> at 133, 119 S.Ct. 493; <i>Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc.,</i> 457 U.S. 332, 343-344, and n. 16, 102 S.Ct. 2466, 73 L.Ed.2d 48 (1982); <i>Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.,</i> 433 U.S. 36, 50, n. 16, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977); <i>United States v. Topco Associates, Inc.,</i> 405 U.S. 596, 609-611, 92 S.Ct. 1126, 31 L.Ed.2d 515 (1972); <i>United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.,</i> 310 U.S. 150, 213-214, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940) (citing and quoting <i>Trenton Potteries, supra,</i> at 397-398, 47 S.Ct. 377).</p>\n<p>The case before us asks which kind of approach the courts should follow where minimum resale price maintenance is at issue. Should they apply a <i>per se</i> rule (or a variation) that would make minimum resale price maintenance always (or <i>almost</i> always) unlawful? Should they apply a \"rule of reason\"? Were the Court writing on a blank slate, I would find these questions difficult. But, of course, the Court is not writing on a blank slate, and that fact makes a considerable legal difference.</p>\n<p>To best explain why the question would be difficult were we deciding it afresh, I briefly summarize several classical arguments for and against the use of a <i>per se</i> rule. The arguments focus on three sets of considerations, those involving: (1) potential anticompetitive effects, (2) potential benefits, and (3) administration. The difficulty arises out of the fact that the different sets of considerations point in different directions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law \u00b6\u00b6 1628-1633, pp. 330-392 (1st ed.1989) (hereinafter Areeda); 8 P. Areeda &amp; H.

Chi. L.Rev. 6, 22-26 (1981); Brief for William S. Comanor and Frederic M. Scherer as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7-10.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, agreements setting minimum resale prices may have serious anticompetitive consequences. <i>In respect to dealers:</i> Resale price maintenance agreements, rather like horizontal price agreements, can diminish or eliminate price competition among dealers of a single brand or (if practiced generally by manufacturers) among multibrand dealers. In doing so, they can prevent dealers from offering customers the lower prices that many customers prefer; they can prevent dealers from responding to changes in demand, say falling demand, by cutting prices; they can encourage dealers to substitute service, for price, competition, thereby threatening wastefully to attract too many resources into that portion of the industry; they can inhibit expansion by more efficient dealers whose lower prices might otherwise attract more customers, stifling the development of new, more efficient modes of retailing; and so forth. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6 1632c, at 319-321; Steiner, The Evolution and Applications of Dual-Stage Thinking, 49 The Antitrust Bulletin 877, 899-900 (2004); Comanor, Vertical Price-Fixing, Vertical Market Restrictions, and the New Antitrust Policy, 98 Harv. L.Rev. 983, 990-1000 (1985).</p>\n<p><i>In respect to producers:</i> Resale price maintenance agreements can help to reinforce the competition-inhibiting behavior of firms in concentrated industries. In such industries firms may tacitly collude, <i>i.e.,</i> observe each other's pricing behavior, each understanding that price cutting by one firm is likely to trigger price competition by all. See 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6 1632d, at 321-323; P. Areeda &amp; L. Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis \u00b6\u00b6 231-233, pp. 276-283 (4th ed.1988) (hereinafter Areeda &amp; Kaplow). Cf. <i>United States v. Container Corp. of America,</i> 393 U.S. 333, 89 S.Ct. 510, 21 L.Ed.2d 526 (1969); Areeda &amp; Kaplow \u00b6\u00b6 247-253, at 327-348. Where that is so, resale price maintenance can make it easier for each producer to identify (by observing retail markets) when a competitor has begun to cut prices. And a producer who cuts wholesale prices <i>without</i> lowering the minimum resale price will stand to gain little, if anything, in increased profits, because the dealer will be unable to stimulate increased consumer demand by passing along the producer's price cut to consumers. In either case, resale price maintenance agreements will tend to prevent price competition from \"breaking out\"; and they will thereby tend to stabilize producer prices. See Pitofsky 1490-1491. Cf., <i>e.g., </i><i>Container Corp., supra,</i> at 336-337, 89 S.Ct. 510.</p>\n<p>Those who express concern about the potential anticompetitive effects find empirical support in the behavior of prices before, and then after, Congress in 1975 repealed the Miller-Tydings Fair Trade Act, 50 Stat. 693, and the McGuire Act, 66 Stat. 631. Those Acts had permitted (but not required) individual States to enact \"fair trade\" laws authorizing minimum resale price maintenance. At the time of repeal minimum resale price maintenance was lawful in 36 States; it was unlawful in 14 States. See Hearings on S. 408 before the Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 173 (1975) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2728</span> (hereinafter Hearings on S. 408) (statement of Thomas E. Kauper, Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division). Comparing prices in the former States with prices in the latter States, the Department of Justice argued that minimum resale price maintenance had raised prices by 19% to 27%. See Hearings on H.R. 2384 before the Subcommittee on Monopolies and Commercial Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 122 (1975) (hereinafter Hearings on H.R. 2384) (statement of Keith I. Clearwaters, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division).</p>\n<p>After repeal, minimum resale price maintenance agreements were unlawful <i>per se</i> in every State. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) staff, after studying numerous price surveys, wrote that collectively the surveys \"indicate[d] that [resale price maintenance] in most cases increased the prices of products sold with [resale price maintenance].\" Bureau of Economics Staff Report to the FTC, T. Overstreet, Resale Price Maintenance: Economic Theories and Empirical Evidence, 160 (1983) (hereinafter Overstreet). Most economists today agree that, in the words of a prominent antitrust treatise, \"resale price maintenance tends to produce higher consumer prices than would otherwise be the case.\" 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6 1604b, at 40 (finding \"[t]he evidence ... persuasive on this point\"). See also Brief for William S. Comanor and Frederic M. Scherer as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 4 (\"It is uniformly acknowledged that [resale price maintenance] and other vertical restraints lead to higher consumer prices\").</p>\n<p>On the other hand, those favoring resale price maintenance have long argued that resale price maintenance agreements can provide important consumer benefits. The majority lists two: First, such agreements can facilitate new entry. <i>Ante,</i> at 2715-2716. For example, a newly entering producer wishing to build a product name might be able to convince dealers to help it do so\u0097if, but only if, the producer can assure those dealers that they will later recoup their investment. Without resale price maintenance, late-entering dealers might take advantage of the earlier investment and, through price competition, drive prices down to the point where the early dealers cannot recover what they spent. By assuring the initial dealers that such later price competition will not occur, resale price maintenance can encourage them to carry the new product, thereby helping the new producer succeed. See 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6\u00b6 1617a, 1631b, at 193-196, 308. The result might be increased competition at the producer level, <i>i.e.,</i> greater <i>inter</i>-brand competition, that brings with it net consumer benefits.</p>\n<p>Second, without resale price maintenance a producer might find its efforts to sell a product undermined by what resale price maintenance advocates call \"free riding.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2715-2716. Suppose a producer concludes that it can succeed only if dealers provide certain services, say, product demonstrations, high quality shops, advertising that creates a certain product image, and so forth. Without resale price maintenance, some dealers might take a \"free ride\" on the investment that others make in providing those services. Such a dealer would save money by not paying for those services and could consequently cut its own price and increase its own sales. Under these circumstances, dealers might prove unwilling to invest in the provision of necessary services. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6\u00b6 1611-1613, 1631c, at 126-165, 309-313; R. Posner, Antitrust Law 172-173 (2d ed.2001); R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 290-291 (1978) (hereinafter Bork); Easterbrook 146-149.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2729</span> Moreover, where a producer and not a group of dealers seeks a resale price maintenance agreement, there is a special reason to believe some such benefits exist. That is because, other things being equal, producers should want to encourage price competition among their dealers. By doing so they will often increase profits by selling more of their product. See <i>Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 56, n. 24, 97 S.Ct. 2549; Bork 290. And that is so, even if the producer possesses sufficient market power to earn a super-normal profit. That is to say, other things being equal, the producer will benefit by charging his dealers a competitive (or even a higher-than-competitive) wholesale price while encouraging price competition among them. Hence, if the producer is the moving force, the producer must have some special reason for wanting resale price maintenance; and in the absence of, say, concentrated producer markets (where that special reason might consist of a desire to stabilize wholesale prices), that special reason may well reflect the special circumstances just described: new entry, \"free riding,\" or variations on those themes.</p>\n<p>The upshot is, as many economists suggest, sometimes resale price maintenance can prove harmful; sometimes it can bring benefits. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Economists as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 16; 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6\u00b6 1631-1632, at 306-328; Pitofsky 1495; Scherer 706-707. But before concluding that courts should consequently apply a rule of reason, I would ask such questions as, how often are harms or benefits likely to occur? How easy is it to separate the beneficial sheep from the antitrust goats?</p>\n<p>Economic discussion, such as the studies the Court relies upon, can <i>help</i> provide answers to these questions, and in doing so, economics can, and should, inform antitrust law. But antitrust law cannot, and should not, precisely replicate economists' (sometimes conflicting) views. That is because law, unlike economics, is an administrative system the effects of which depend upon the content of rules and precedents only as they are applied by judges and juries in courts and by lawyers advising their clients. And that fact means that courts will often bring their own administrative judgment to bear, sometimes applying rules of <i>per se</i> unlawfulness to business practices even when those practices sometimes produce benefits. See, <i>e.g.,</i> F.M. Scherer &amp; D. Ross, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 335-339 (3d ed.1990) (hereinafter Scherer &amp; Ross) (describing some circumstances under which price-fixing agreements could be more beneficial than \"unfettered competition,\" but also noting potential costs of moving from a <i>per se</i> ban to a rule of reasonableness assessment of such agreements).</p>\n<p>I have already described studies and analyses that suggest (though they cannot prove) that resale price maintenance can cause harms with some regularity\u0097and certainly when dealers are the driving force. But what about benefits? How often, for example, will the benefits to which the Court points occur in practice? I can find no economic consensus on this point. There is a consensus in the literature that \"free riding\" takes place. But \"free riding\" often takes place in the economy without any legal effort to stop it. Many visitors to California take free rides on the Pacific Coast Highway. We all benefit freely from ideas, such as that of creating the first supermarket. Dealers often take a \"free ride\" on investments that others have made in building a product's name and reputation. The question is how often the \"free riding\" problem is serious enough significantly to deter dealer investment.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2730</span> To be more specific, one can easily <i>imagine</i> a dealer who refuses to provide important presale services, say a detailed explanation of how a product works (or who fails to provide a proper atmosphere in which to sell expensive perfume or alligator billfolds), lest customers use that \"free\" service (or enjoy the psychological benefit arising when a high-priced retailer stocks a particular brand of billfold or handbag) and then buy from another dealer at a lower price. Sometimes this must happen in reality. But does it happen often? We do, after all, live in an economy where firms, despite <i>Dr. Miles' per se</i> rule, still sell complex technical equipment (as well as expensive perfume and alligator billfolds) to consumers.</p>\n<p>All this is to say that the ultimate question is not whether, but <i>how much,</i> \"free riding\" of this sort takes place. And, after reading the briefs, I must answer that question with an uncertain \"sometimes.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for William S. Comanor and Frederic M. Scherer as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 6-7 (noting \"skepticism in the economic literature about how often [free riding] actually occurs\"); Scherer &amp; Ross 551-555 (explaining the \"severe limitations\" of the free-rider justification for resale price maintenance); Pitofsky, Why <i>Dr. Miles</i> Was Right, 8 Regulation, No. 1, pp. 27, 29-30 (Jan./Feb.1984) (similar analysis).</p>\n<p>How easily can courts identify instances in which the benefits are likely to outweigh potential harms? My own answer is, <i>not very easily.</i> For one thing, it is often difficult to identify <i>who</i>\u0097producer or dealer\u0097is the moving force behind any given resale price maintenance agreement. Suppose, for example, several large multibrand retailers all sell resale-price-maintained products. Suppose further that small producers set retail prices because they fear that, otherwise, the large retailers will favor (say, by allocating better shelf-space) the goods of other producers who practice resale price maintenance. Who \"initiated\" this practice, the retailers hoping for considerable insulation from retail competition, or the producers, who simply seek to deal best with the circumstances they find? For another thing, as I just said, it is difficult to determine just when, and where, the \"free riding\" problem is serious enough to warrant legal protection.</p>\n<p>I recognize that scholars have sought to develop check lists and sets of questions that will help courts separate instances where anticompetitive harms are more likely from instances where only benefits are likely to be found. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6\u00b6 1633c-1633e, at 330-339. See also Brief for William S. Comanor and Frederic M. Scherer as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 8-10. But applying these criteria in court is often easier said than done. The Court's invitation to consider the existence of \"market power,\" for example, <i>ante,</i> at 2720, invites lengthy time-consuming argument among competing experts, as they seek to apply abstract, highly technical, criteria to often ill-defined markets. And resale price maintenance cases, unlike a major merger or monopoly case, are likely to prove numerous and involve only private parties. One cannot fairly expect judges and juries in such cases to apply complex economic criteria without making a considerable number of mistakes, which themselves may impose serious costs. See, <i>e.g.,</i> H. Hovenkamp, The Antitrust Enterprise 105 (2005) (litigating a rule of reason case is \"one of the most costly procedures in antitrust practice\"). See also Bok, Section 7 of the Clayton Act and the Merging of Law and Economics, 74 Harv. L.Rev. 226, 238-247 (1960) (describing lengthy FTC efforts to apply complex criteria in a merger case).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2731</span> Are there special advantages to a bright-line rule? Without such a rule, it is often unfair, and consequently impractical, for enforcement officials to bring criminal proceedings. And since enforcement resources are limited, that loss may tempt some producers or dealers to enter into agreements that are, on balance, anticompetitive.</p>\n<p>Given the uncertainties that surround key items in the overall balance sheet, particularly in respect to the \"administrative\" questions, I can concede to the majority that the problem is difficult. And, if forced to decide now, at most I might agree that the <i>per se</i> rule should be slightly modified to allow an exception for the more easily identifiable and temporary condition of \"new entry.\" See Pitofsky 1495. But I am not now forced to decide this question. The question before us is not what should be the rule, starting from scratch. We here must decide whether to change a clear and simple price-related antitrust rule that the courts have applied for nearly a century.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We write, not on a blank slate, but on a slate that begins with <i>Dr. Miles</i> and goes on to list a century's worth of similar cases, massive amounts of advice that lawyers have provided their clients, and untold numbers of business decisions those clients have taken in reliance upon that advice. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co.,</i> 321 U.S. 707, 721, 64 S.Ct. 805, 88 L.Ed. 1024 (1944); <i>Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 51, n. 18, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (\"The <i>per se</i> illegality of [vertical] price restrictions has been established firmly for many years ...\"). Indeed a Westlaw search shows that <i>Dr. Miles</i> itself has been cited dozens of times in this Court and hundreds of times in lower courts. Those who wish this Court to change so well-established a legal precedent bear a heavy burden of proof. See <i>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois,</i> 431 U.S. 720, 736, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977) (noting, in declining to overrule an earlier case interpreting \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, that \"considerations of <i>stare decisis</i> weigh heavily in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation of its legislation\"). I am not aware of any case in which this Court has overturned so well-established a statutory precedent. Regardless, I do not see how the Court can claim that ordinary criteria for over-ruling an earlier case have been met. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 854-855, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). See also <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, at 19-21, 127 S.Ct. 2652, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 2007 WL 1804336 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>I can find no change in circumstances in the past several decades that helps the majority's position. In fact, there has been one important change that argues strongly to the contrary. In 1975, Congress repealed the McGuire and Miller-Tydings Acts. See Consumer Goods Pricing Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 801. And it thereby consciously <i>extended Dr. Miles' per se</i> rule. Indeed, at that time the Department of Justice and the FTC, then urging application of the <i>per se</i> rule, discussed virtually every argument presented now to this Court as well as others not here presented. And they explained to Congress why Congress should reject them. See Hearings on S. 408, at 176-177 (statement of Thomas E. Kauper, Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division); <i>id.,</i> at 170-172 (testimony of Lewis A. Engman, Chairman of the FTC); Hearings on H.R. 2384, at 113-114 (testimony <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2732</span> of Keith I. Clearwaters, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division). Congress fully understood, and consequently intended, that the result of its repeal of McGuire and Miller-Tydings would be to make minimum resale price maintenance <i>per se</i> unlawful. See, <i>e.g.,</i> S.Rep. No. 94-466, pp. 1-3 (1975), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1975, pp. 1569, 1570-71 (\"Without [the exemptions authorized by the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts,] the agreements they authorize would violate the antitrust laws.... [R]epeal of the fair trade laws generally will prohibit manufacturers from enforcing resale prices\"). See also <i>Sylvania, supra,</i> at 51, n. 18, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (\"Congress recently has expressed its approval of a <i>per se</i> analysis of vertical price restrictions by repealing those provisions of the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts allowing fair-trade pricing at the option of the individual States\").</p>\n<p>Congress did not prohibit this Court from reconsidering the <i>per se</i> rule. But enacting major legislation premised upon the existence of that rule constitutes important public reliance upon that rule. And doing so aware of the relevant arguments constitutes even stronger reliance upon the Court's keeping the rule, at least in the absence of some significant change in respect to those arguments.</p>\n<p>Have there been any such changes? There have been a few economic studies, described in some of the briefs, that argue, contrary to the testimony of the Justice Department and FTC to Congress in 1975, that resale price maintenance is not harmful. One study, relying on an analysis of litigated resale price maintenance cases from 1975 to 1982, concludes that resale price maintenance does not ordinarily involve producer or dealer collusion. See Ippolito, Resale Price Maintenance: Empirical Evidence from Litigation, 34 J. Law &amp; Econ. 263, 281-282, 292 (1991). But this study equates the failure of plaintiffs to <i>allege</i> collusion with the <i>absence</i> of collusion\u0097an equation that overlooks the superfluous nature of allegations of horizontal collusion in a resale price maintenance case and the tacit form that such collusion might take. See H. Hovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy \u00a7 11.3c, p. 464, n. 19 (3d ed.2005); <i>supra,</i> at 2711-2713.</p>\n<p>The other study provides a theoretical basis for concluding that resale price maintenance \"need not lead to higher retail prices.\" Marvel &amp; McCafferty, The Political Economy of Resale Price Maintenance, 94 J. Pol. Econ. 1074, 1075 (1986). But this study develops a theoretical model \"under the assumption that [resale price maintenance] is efficiency-enhancing.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Its only empirical support is a 1940 study that the authors acknowledge is much criticized. See <i>id.,</i> at 1091. And many other economists take a different view. See Brief for William S. Comanor and Frederic M. Scherer as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 4.</p>\n<p>Regardless, taken together, these studies at most may offer some mild support for the majority's position. But they cannot constitute a major change in circumstances.</p>\n<p>Petitioner and some <i>amici</i> have also presented us with newer studies that show that resale price maintenance sometimes brings consumer benefits. Overstreet 119-129 (describing numerous case studies). But the proponents of a <i>per se</i> rule have always conceded as much. What is remarkable about the majority's arguments is that <i>nothing</i> in this respect <i>is new.</i> See <i>supra,</i> at 2711, 2716 (citing articles and congressional testimony going back several decades). The only new feature of these arguments lies in the fact that the most current advocates of overruling <i>Dr. Miles</i> have abandoned a host of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2733</span> other not-very-persuasive arguments upon which prior resale price maintenance proponents used to rely. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 Areeda \u00b6 1631a, at 350-352 (listing \"`[t]raditional' justifications\" for resale price maintenance).</p>\n<p>The one arguable exception consists of the majority's claim that \"even absent free riding,\" resale price maintenance \"may be the most efficient way to expand the manufacturer's market share by inducing the retailer's performance and allowing it to use its own initiative and experience in providing valuable services.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2716. I cannot count this as an exception, however, because I do not understand how, in the absence of free-riding (and assuming competitiveness), an established producer would need resale price maintenance. Why, on these assumptions, would a dealer not \"expand\" its \"market share\" as best that dealer sees fit, obtaining appropriate payment from consumers in the process? There may be an answer to this question. But I have not seen it. And I do not think that we should place significant weight upon justifications that the parties do not explain with sufficient clarity for a generalist judge to understand.</p>\n<p>No one claims that the American economy has changed in ways that might support the majority. Concentration in retailing has increased. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondent 18 (since minimum resale price maintenance was banned nationwide in 1975, the total number of retailers has dropped while the growth in sales per store has risen); Brief for American Antitrust Institute as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 17, n. 20 (citing private study reporting that the combined sales of the 10 largest retailers worldwide has grown to nearly 30% of total retail sales of top 250 retailers; also quoting 1999 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report stating that the \"`last twenty years have seen momentous changes in retail distribution including significant increases in concentration'\"); Mamen, Facing Goliath: Challenging the Impacts of Supermarket Consolidation on our Local Economies, Communities, and Food Security, The Oakland Institute, 1 Policy Brief, No. 3, pp. 1, 2 (Spring 2007), http://www.oakland institute.org/pdfs/facing_goliath.pdf (as visited June 25, 2007, and available in Clerks of Court's case file) (noting that \"[f]or many decades, the top five food retail firms in the U.S. controlled less than 20 percent of the market\"; from 1997 to 2000, \"the top five firms increased their market share from 24 to 42 percent of all retail sales\"; and \"[b]y 2003, they controlled over half of all grocery sales\"). That change, other things being equal, may enable (and motivate) more retailers, accounting for a greater percentage of total retail sales volume, to seek resale price maintenance, thereby making it more difficult for price-cutting competitors (perhaps internet retailers) to obtain market share.</p>\n<p>Nor has anyone argued that concentration among manufacturers that might use resale price maintenance has diminished significantly. And as far as I can tell, it has not. Consider household electrical appliances, which a study from the late 1950's suggests constituted a significant portion of those products subject to resale price maintenance at that time. See Hollander, United States of America, in Resale Price Maintenance 67, 80-81 (B. Yamey ed.1966). Although it is somewhat difficult to compare census data from 2002 with that from several decades ago (because of changes in the classification system), it is clear that at least some subsets of the household electrical appliance industry are <i>more</i> concentrated, in terms of manufacturer market power, now than they were then. For instance, the top eight domestic manufacturers of household cooking appliances accounted for 68% <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2734</span> of the domestic market (measured by value of shipments) in 1963 (the earliest date for which I was able to find data), compared with 77% in 2002. See Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, 1972 Census of Manufacturers, Special Report Series, Concentration Ratios in Manufacturing, No. MC72(SR)-2, p. SR2-38 (1975) (hereinafter 1972 Census); Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, 2002 Economic Census, Concentration Ratios: 2002, No. EC02-31SR-1, p. 55 (2006) (hereinafter 2002 Census). The top eight domestic manufacturers of household laundry equipment accounted for 95% of the domestic market in 1963 (90% in 1958), compared with 99% in 2002. 1972 Census, at SR2-38; 2002 Census, at 55. And the top eight domestic manufacturers of household refrigerators and freezers accounted for 91% of the domestic market in 1963, compared with 95% in 2002. 1972 Census, at SR2-38; 2002 Census, at 55. Increased concentration among manufacturers increases the likelihood that producer-originated resale price maintenance will prove more prevalent today than in years past, and more harmful. At the very least, the majority has not explained how these, or other changes in the economy could help support its position.</p>\n<p>In sum, there is no relevant change. And without some such change, there is no ground for abandoning a well-established antitrust rule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>With the preceding discussion in mind, I would consult the list of factors that our case law indicates are relevant when we consider overruling an earlier case. Justice SCALIA, writing separately in another of our cases this Term, well summarizes that law. See <i>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S. at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 2684-2686, 2007 WL 1804336. (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). And every relevant factor he mentions argues against overruling <i>Dr. Miles</i> here.</p>\n<p>First, the Court applies <i>stare decisis</i> more \"rigidly\" in statutory than in constitutional cases. See <i>Glidden Co. v. Zdanok,</i> 370 U.S. 530, 543, 82 S.Ct. 1459, 8 L.Ed.2d 671 (1962); <i>Illinois Brick Co.,</i> 431 U.S., at 736, 97 S.Ct. 2061. This is a statutory case.</p>\n<p>Second, the Court does sometimes overrule cases that it decided wrongly only a reasonably short time ago. As Justice SCALIA put it, \"[o]verruling a <i>constitutional</i> case decided just a few years earlier is far from unprecedented.\" <i>Wisconsin Right to Life,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 2685, 2007 WL 1804336 (emphasis added). We here overrule one <i>statutory</i> case, <i>Dr. Miles,</i> decided 100 years ago, and we overrule the cases that reaffirmed its <i>per se</i> rule in the intervening years. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Trenton Potteries,</i> 273 U.S., at 399-401, 47 S.Ct. 377; <i>Bausch &amp; Lomb,</i> 321 U.S., at 721, 64 S.Ct. 805; <i>United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.,</i> 362 U.S. 29, 45-47, 80 S.Ct. 503, 4 L.Ed.2d 505 (1960); <i>Simpson v. Union Oil Co. of Cal.,</i> 377 U.S. 13, 16-17, 84 S.Ct. 1051, 12 L.Ed.2d 98 (1964).</p>\n<p>Third, the fact that a decision creates an \"unworkable\" legal regime argues in favor of overruling. See <i>Payne v. Tennessee,</i> 501 U.S. 808, 827-828, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991); <i>Swift &amp; Co. v. Wickham,</i> 382 U.S. 111, 116, 86 S.Ct. 258, 15 L.Ed.2d 194 (1965). Implementation of the <i>per se</i> rule, even with the complications attendant the exception allowed for in <i>United States v. Colgate &amp; Co.,</i> 250 U.S. 300, 39 S.Ct. 465, 63 L.Ed. 992 (1919), has proved practical over the course of the last century, particularly when compared with the many complexities of litigating a case under the \"rule of reason\" regime. No one has shown how moving from the <i>Dr. Miles</i> regime to \"rule of reason\" analysis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2735</span> would make the legal regime governing minimum resale price maintenance more \"administrable,\" <i>Wisconsin Right to Life,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 2685, 2007 WL 1804336 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), particularly since <i>Colgate</i> would remain good law with respect to <i>unreasonable</i> price maintenance.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the fact that a decision \"unsettles\" the law may argue in favor of overruling. See <i>Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 47, 97 S.Ct. 2549; <i>Wisconsin Right to Life,</i> ___ U.S., at ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 2685-2686, 2007 WL 1804336 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The <i>per se</i> rule is well-settled law, as the Court itself has previously recognized. <i>Sylvania, supra,</i> at 51, n. 18, 97 S.Ct. 2549. It is the majority's change here that will unsettle the law.</p>\n<p>Fifth, the fact that a case involves property rights or contract rights, where reliance interests are involved, argues against overruling. <i>Payne, supra,</i> at 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597. This case involves contract rights and perhaps property rights (consider shopping malls). And there has been considerable reliance upon the <i>per se</i> rule. As I have said, Congress relied upon the continued vitality of <i>Dr. Miles</i> when it repealed Miller-Tydings and McGuire. <i>Supra,</i> at 2716-2717. The Executive Branch argued for repeal on the assumption that <i>Dr. Miles</i> stated the law. <i>Ibid.</i> Moreover, whole sectors of the economy have come to rely upon the <i>per se</i> rule. A factory outlet store tells us that the rule \"form[s] an essential part of the regulatory background against which [that firm] and many other discount retailers have financed, structured, and operated their businesses.\" Brief for Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corp. as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 5. The Consumer Federation of America tells us that large low-price retailers would not exist without <i>Dr. Miles</i>; minimum resale price maintenance, \"by stabilizing price levels and preventing low-price competition, erects a potentially insurmountable barrier to entry for such low-price innovators.\" Brief for Consumer Federation of America as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 5, 7-9 (discussing, <i>inter alia,</i> comments by Wal-Mart's founder 25 years ago that relaxation of the <i>per se</i> ban on minimum resale price maintenance would be a \"`great danger'\" to Wal-Mart's then-relatively-nascent business). See also Brief for American Antitrust Institute as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 14-15, and sources cited therein (making the same point). New distributors, including internet distributors, have similarly invested time, money, and labor in an effort to bring yet lower cost goods to Americans.</p>\n<p>This Court's overruling of the <i>per se</i> rule jeopardizes this reliance, and more. What about malls built on the assumption that a discount distributor will remain an anchor tenant? What about home buyers who have taken a home's distance from such a mall into account? What about Americans, producers, distributors, and consumers, who have understandably assumed, at least for the last 30 years, that price competition is a legally guaranteed way of life? The majority denies none of this. It simply says that these \"reliance interests ..., like the reliance interests in <i>Khan,</i> cannot justify an inefficient rule.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2724.</p>\n<p>The Court minimizes the importance of this reliance, adding that it \"is also of note\" that at the time resale price maintenance contracts were lawful \"`no more than a tiny fraction of manufacturers ever employed'\" the practice. <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting Overstreet 6). By \"tiny\" the Court means manufacturers that accounted for up to \"`ten percent of consumer goods purchases'\" annually. <i>Ibid.</i> That figure in today's economy equals just over $300 billion. See Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2736</span> Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2007, p. 649 (126th ed.) (over $3 trillion in U.S. retail sales in 2002). Putting the Court's estimate together with the Justice Department's early 1970's study translates a legal regime that permits all resale price maintenance into retail bills that are higher by an average of roughly $750 to $1000 annually for an American family of four. Just how much higher retail bills will be after the Court's decision today, of course, depends upon what is now unknown, namely how courts will decide future cases under a \"rule of reason.\" But these figures indicate that the amounts involved are important to American families and cannot be dismissed as \"tiny.\"</p>\n<p>Sixth, the fact that a rule of law has become \"embedded\" in our \"national culture\" argues strongly against overruling. <i>Dickerson v. United States,</i> 530 U.S. 428, 443-444, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000). The <i>per se</i> rule forbidding minimum resale price maintenance agreements has long been \"embedded\" in the law of antitrust. It involves price, the economy's \"`central nervous system.'\" <i>National Soc. of Professional Engineers,</i> 435 U.S., at 692, 98 S.Ct. 1355 (quoting <i>Socony-Vacuum Oil,</i> 310 U.S., at 226, n. 59, 60 S.Ct. 811). It reflects a basic antitrust assumption (that consumers often prefer lower prices to more service). It embodies a basic antitrust objective (providing consumers with a free choice about such matters). And it creates an easily administered and enforceable bright line, \"Do not agree about price,\" that businesses as well as lawyers have long understood.</p>\n<p>The only contrary <i>stare decisis</i> factor that the majority mentions consists of its claim that this Court has \"[f]rom the beginning... treated the Sherman Act as a common-law statute,\" and has previously overruled antitrust precedent. <i>Ante,</i> at 2720, 2721-2722. It points in support to <i>State Oil Co. v. Khan,</i> 522 U.S. 3, 118 S.Ct. 275, 139 L.Ed.2d 199 (1997), overruling <i>Albrecht v. Herald Co.,</i> 390 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 869, 19 L.Ed.2d 998 (1968), in which this Court had held that <i>maximum</i> resale price agreements were unlawful <i>per se,</i> and to <i>Sylvania,</i> overruling <i>United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.,</i> 388 U.S. 365, 87 S.Ct. 1856, 18 L.Ed.2d 1249 (1967), in which this Court had held that producer-imposed territorial limits were unlawful <i>per se.</i></p>\n<p>The Court decided <i>Khan,</i> however, 29 years after <i>Albrecht</i>\u0097still a significant period, but nowhere close to the century <i>Dr. Miles</i> has stood. The Court specifically noted the <i>lack</i> of any significant reliance upon <i>Albrecht.</i> 522 U.S., at 18-19, 118 S.Ct. 275 (<i>Albrecht</i> has had \"little or no relevance to ongoing enforcement of the Sherman Act\"). <i>Albrecht</i> had far less support in traditional antitrust principles than did <i>Dr. Miles.</i> Compare, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6 1632, at 316-328 (analyzing potential harms of minimum resale price maintenance), with <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 1637, at 352-361 (analyzing potential harms of maximum resale price maintenance). See also, <i>e.g.,</i> Pitofsky 1490, n. 17. And Congress had nowhere expressed support for <i>Albrecht's</i> rule. <i>Khan, supra,</i> at 19, 118 S.Ct. 275.</p>\n<p>In <i>Sylvania,</i> the Court, in overruling <i>Schwinn,</i> explicitly distinguished <i>Dr. Miles</i> on the ground that while Congress had \"recently ... expressed its approval of a <i>per se</i> analysis of vertical price restrictions\" by repealing the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts, \"[n]o similar expression of congressional intent exists for nonprice restrictions.\" 433 U.S., at 51, n. 18, 97 S.Ct. 2549. Moreover, the Court decided <i>Sylvania</i> only a decade after <i>Schwinn.</i> And it based its overruling on a generally perceived need to avoid \"confusion\" in the law, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2737</span> 433 U.S., at 47-49, 97 S.Ct. 2549, a factor totally absent here.</p>\n<p>The Court suggests that it is following \"the common-law tradition.\" <i>Ante</i> at 2724. But the common law would not have permitted overruling <i>Dr. Miles</i> in these circumstances. Common-law courts rarely overruled well-established earlier rules outright. Rather, they would over time issue decisions that gradually eroded the scope and effect of the rule in question, which might eventually lead the courts to put the rule to rest. One can argue that modifying the <i>per se</i> rule to make an exception, say, for new entry, see Pitofsky 1495, could prove consistent with this approach. To swallow up a century-old precedent, potentially affecting many billions of dollars of sales, is not. The reader should compare today's \"common-law\" decision with Justice Cardozo's decision in <i>Allegheny College v. National Chautauqua Cty. Bank of Jamestown,</i> 246 N.Y. 369, 159 N.E. 173 (1927), and note a gradualism that does not characterize today's decision.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a Court that rests its decision upon economists' views of the economic merits should also take account of legal scholars' views about common-law overruling. Professors Hart and Sacks list 12 factors (similar to those I have mentioned) that support judicial \"adherence to prior holdings.\" They all support adherence to <i>Dr. Miles</i> here. See H. Hart &amp; A. Sacks, The Legal Process 568-569 (W. Eskridge &amp; P. Frickey eds.1994). Karl Llewellyn has written that the common-law judge's \"conscious reshaping\" of prior law \"must so move as to hold the degree of movement down to the degree to which need truly presses.\" The Bramble Bush 156 (1960). Where here is the pressing need? The Court notes that the FTC argues here in favor of a rule of reason. See <i>ante,</i> at 2720-2721. But both Congress and the FTC, unlike courts, are well-equipped to gather empirical evidence outside the context of a single case. As neither has done so, we cannot conclude with confidence that the gains from eliminating the <i>per se</i> rule will outweigh the costs.</p>\n<p>In sum, every <i>stare decisis</i> concern this Court has ever mentioned counsels against overruling here. It is difficult for me to understand how one can believe both that (1) satisfying a set of <i>stare decisis</i> concerns justifies over-ruling a recent constitutional decision, <i>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S., at ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 2684-2686, 2007 WL 1804336 (SCALIA, J., joined by KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), but (2) failing to satisfy any of those same concerns nonetheless permits overruling a longstanding statutory decision. Either those concerns are relevant or they are not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The only safe predictions to make about today's decision are that it will likely raise the price of goods at retail and that it will create considerable legal turbulence as lower courts seek to develop workable principles. I do not believe that the majority has shown new or changed conditions sufficient to warrant overruling a decision of such long standing. All ordinary <i>stare decisis</i> considerations indicate the contrary. For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n</div>",

Argued March 26, 2007\u2014Decided June 28, 2007\nGiven its policy of refusing to sell to retailers that discount its goods\n  below suggested prices, petitioner (Leegin) stopped selling to respon\n  dent\u2019s (PSKS) store. PSKS filed suit, alleging, inter alia, that Leegin\n  violated the antitrust laws by entering into vertical agreements with\n  its retailers to set minimum resale prices. The District Court ex\n  cluded expert testimony about Leegin\u2019s pricing policy\u2019s procompeti\n  tive effects on the ground that Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park\n  & Sons Co., 220 U.

On appeal, the Fifth Circuit\n  declined to apply the rule of reason to Leegin\u2019s vertical price-fixing\n  agreements and affirmed, finding that Dr. Miles\u2019 per se rule rendered\n  irrelevant any procompetitive justifications for Leegin\u2019s policy.\nHeld: Dr. Miles is overruled and vertical price restraints are to be\n judged by the rule of reason. Pp. 5\u201328.\n    (a) The accepted standard for testing whether a practice restrains\n trade in violation of \u00a71 is the rule of reason, which requires the fact-\n finder to weigh \u201call of the circumstances,\u201d Continental T. V., Inc. v.\n GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.

The rule distinguishes\n between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to\n the consumer and those with procompetitive effect that are in the\n consumer\u2019s best interest. However, when a restraint is deemed\n2         LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                         PSKS, INC.                                        \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    \u201cunlawful per se,\u201d ibid., the need to study an individual restraint\u2019s\n    reasonableness in light of real market forces is eliminated, Business\n    Electronics Corp. v.

Re\n    sort to per se rules is confined to restraints \u201cthat would always or al\n    most always tend to restrict competition and decrease output.\u201d Ibid.\n    Thus, a per se rule is appropriate only after courts have had consid\n    erable experience with the type of restraint at issue, see Broadcast\n    Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 9, and\n    only if they can predict with confidence that the restraint would be\n    invalidated in all or almost all instances under the rule of reason, see\n    Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 344. Pp. 5\u2013\n    7.\n       (b) Because the reasons upon which Dr. Miles relied do not justify a\n    per se rule, it is necessary to examine, in the first instance, the eco\n    nomic effects of vertical agreements to fix minimum resale prices and\n    to determine whether the per se rule is nonetheless appropriate.\n    Were this Court considering the issue as an original matter, the rule\n    of reason, not a per se rule of unlawfulness, would be the appropriate\n    standard to judge vertical price restraints. Pp. 7\u201319.\n         (1) Economics literature is replete with procompetitive justifica\n    tions for a manufacturer\u2019s use of resale price maintenance, and the\n    few recent studies on the subject also cast doubt on the conclusion\n    that the practice meets the criteria for a per se rule. The justifica\n    tions for vertical price restraints are similar to those for other verti\n    cal restraints. Minimum resale price maintenance can stimulate in\n    terbrand competition among manufacturers selling different brands\n    of the same type of product by reducing intrabrand competition\n    among retailers selling the same brand. This is important because\n    the antitrust laws\u2019 \u201cprimary purpose . . . is to protect interbrand\n    competition,\u201d Khan, supra, at 15. A single manufacturer\u2019s use of ver\n    tical price restraints tends to eliminate intrabrand price competition;\n    this in turn encourages retailers to invest in services or promotional\n    efforts that aid the manufacturer\u2019s position as against rival manufac\n    turers. Resale price maintenance may also give consumers more op\n    tions to choose among low-price, low-service brands; high-price, high-\n    service brands; and brands falling in between. Absent vertical price\n    restraints, retail services that enhance interbrand competition might\n    be underprovided because discounting retailers can free ride on re\n    tailers who furnish services and then capture some of the demand\n    those services generate. Retail price maintenance can also increase\n    interbrand competition by facilitating market entry for new firms\n    and brands and by encouraging retailer services that would not be\n    provided even absent free riding.

Resale price maintenance\nmay, for example, facilitate a manufacturer cartel or be used to or\nganize retail cartels. It can also be abused by a powerful manufac\nturer or retailer. Thus, the potential anticompetitive consequences of\nvertical price restraints must not be ignored or underestimated.\nPp. 12\u201314.\n      (3) Notwithstanding the risks of unlawful conduct, it cannot be\nstated with any degree of confidence that retail price maintenance\n\u201calways or almost always tend[s] to restrict competition and decrease\noutput,\u201d Business Electronics, supra, at 723. Vertical retail-price\nagreements have either procompetitive or anticompetitive effects, de\npending on the circumstances in which they were formed; and the\nlimited empirical evidence available does not suggest efficient uses of\nthe agreements are infrequent or hypothetical. A per se rule should\nnot be adopted for administrative convenience alone. Such rules can\nbe counterproductive, increasing the antitrust system\u2019s total cost by\nprohibiting procompetitive conduct the antitrust laws should encour\nage. And a per se rule cannot be justified by the possibility of higher\nprices absent a further showing of anticompetitive conduct. The anti\ntrust laws primarily are designed to protect interbrand competition\nfrom which lower prices can later result. Respondent\u2019s argument\noverlooks that, in general, the interests of manufacturers and con\nsumers are aligned with respect to retailer profit margins. Resale\nprice maintenance has economic dangers. If the rule of reason were\nto apply, courts would have to be diligent in eliminating their anti-\ncompetitive uses from the market. Factors relevant to the inquiry\nare the number of manufacturers using the practice, the restraint\u2019s\nsource, and a manufacturer\u2019s market power. The rule of reason is de\nsigned and used to ascertain whether transactions are anticompeti\ntive or procompetitive. This standard principle applies to vertical\nprice restraints. As courts gain experience with these restraints by\napplying the rule of reason over the course of decisions, they can es\ntablish the litigation structure to ensure the rule operates to elimi\nnate anticompetitive restraints from the market and to provide more\nguidance to businesses. Pp. 14\u201319.\n   (c) Stare decisis does not compel continued adherence to the per se\nrule here. Because the Sherman Act is treated as a common-law\nstatute, its prohibition on \u201crestraint[s] of trade\u201d evolves to meet the\ndynamics of present economic conditions. The rule of reason\u2019s case-\nby-case adjudication implements this common-law approach. Here,\nrespected economics authorities suggest that the per se rule is inap\npropriate. And both the Department of Justice and the Federal\nTrade Commission recommend replacing the per se rule with the rule\n4         LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                         PSKS, INC.                                       \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    of reason.

It is not sur\n    prising that the Court has distanced itself from Dr. Miles\u2019 rationales,\n    for the case was decided not long after the Sherman Act was enacted,\n    when the Court had little experience with antitrust analysis. Only\n    eight years after Dr. Miles, the Court reined in the decision, holding\n    that a manufacturer can suggest resale prices and refuse to deal with\n    distributors who do not follow them, United States v. Colgate & Co.,\n    250 U. S. 300, 307\u2013308; and more recently the Court has tempered,\n    limited, or overruled once strict vertical restraint prohibitions, see,\n    e.g., GTE Sylvania, supra, at 57\u201359. The Dr. Miles rule is also incon\n    sistent with a principled framework, for it makes little economic\n    sense when analyzed with the Court\u2019s other vertical restraint cases.\n    Deciding that procompetitive effects of resale price maintenance are\n    insufficient to overrule Dr. Miles would call into question cases such\n    as Colgate and GTE Sylvania.

John D. Park & Sons Co.,\n220 U. S. 373 (1911), the Court established the rule that it\nis per se illegal under \u00a71 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71, for a manufacturer to agree with its distributor to set\nthe minimum price the distributor can charge for the\nmanufacturer\u2019s goods. The question presented by the\ninstant case is whether the Court should overrule the per\nse rule and allow resale price maintenance agreements to\nbe judged by the rule of reason, the usual standard applied\nto determine if there is a violation of \u00a71. The Court has\nabandoned the rule of per se illegality for other vertical\nrestraints a manufacturer imposes on its distributors.\nRespected economic analysts, furthermore, conclude that\nvertical price restraints can have procompetitive effects.\nWe now hold that Dr. Miles should be overruled and that\nvertical price restraints are to be judged by the rule of\nreason.\n                          I\n  Petitioner, Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc.\n2      LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                       PSKS, INC.                           \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n(Leegin), designs, manufactures, and distributes leather\ngoods and accessories. In 1991, Leegin began to sell belts\nunder the brand name \u201cBrighton.\u201d The Brighton brand\nhas now expanded into a variety of women\u2019s fashion acces\nsories. It is sold across the United States in over 5,000\nretail establishments, for the most part independent,\nsmall boutiques and specialty stores. Leegin\u2019s president,\nJerry Kohl, also has an interest in about 70 stores that sell\nBrighton products. Leegin asserts that, at least for its\nproducts, small retailers treat customers better, provide\ncustomers more services, and make their shopping experi\nence more satisfactory than do larger, often impersonal\nretailers. Kohl explained: \u201c[W]e want the consumers to\nget a different experience than they get in Sam\u2019s Club or\nin Wal-Mart. And you can\u2019t get that kind of experience or\nsupport or customer service from a store like Wal-Mart.\u201d 5\nRecord 127.\n  Respondent, PSKS, Inc. (PSKS), operates Kay\u2019s Kloset,\na women\u2019s apparel store in Lewisville, Texas. Kay\u2019s Kloset\nbuys from about 75 different manufacturers and at one\ntime sold the Brighton brand. It first started purchasing\nBrighton goods from Leegin in 1995. Once it began selling\nthe brand, the store promoted Brighton. For example, it\nran Brighton advertisements and had Brighton days in\nthe store. Kay\u2019s Kloset became the destination retailer in\nthe area to buy Brighton products. Brighton was the\nstore\u2019s most important brand and once accounted for 40 to\n50 percent of its profits.\n  In 1997, Leegin instituted the \u201cBrighton Retail Pricing\nand Promotion Policy.\u201d 4 id., at 939. Following the policy,\nLeegin refused to sell to retailers that discounted Brighton\ngoods below suggested prices. The policy contained an\nexception for products not selling well that the retailer did\nnot plan on reordering. In the letter to retailers establish\ning the policy, Leegin stated:\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201cIn this age of mega stores like Macy\u2019s, Blooming-\n    dales, May Co. and others, consumers are perplexed\n    by promises of product quality and support of product\n    which we believe is lacking in these large stores.\n    Consumers are further confused by the ever popular\n    sale, sale, sale, etc.\n      \u201cWe, at Leegin, choose to break away from the pack\n    by selling [at] specialty stores; specialty stores that\n    can offer the customer great quality merchandise, su\n    perb service, and support the Brighton product 365\n    days a year on a consistent basis.\n      \u201cWe realize that half the equation is Leegin produc\n    ing great Brighton product and the other half is you,\n    our retailer, creating great looking stores selling our\n    products in a quality manner.\u201d Ibid.\nLeegin adopted the policy to give its retailers sufficient\nmargins to provide customers the service central to its\ndistribution strategy. It also expressed concern that dis\ncounting harmed Brighton\u2019s brand image and reputation.\n   A year after instituting the pricing policy Leegin intro\nduced a marketing strategy known as the \u201cHeart Store\nProgram.\u201d See id., at 962\u2013972. It offered retailers incen\ntives to become Heart Stores, and, in exchange, retailers\npledged, among other things, to sell at Leegin\u2019s suggested\nprices. Kay\u2019s Kloset became a Heart Store soon after\nLeegin created the program. After a Leegin employee\nvisited the store and found it unattractive, the parties\nappear to have agreed that Kay\u2019s Kloset would not be a\nHeart Store beyond 1998. Despite losing this status, Kay\u2019s\nKloset continued to increase its Brighton sales.\n   In December 2002, Leegin discovered Kay\u2019s Kloset had\nbeen marking down Brighton\u2019s entire line by 20 percent.\nKay\u2019s Kloset contended it placed Brighton products on sale\nto compete with nearby retailers who also were undercut\nting Leegin\u2019s suggested prices. Leegin, nonetheless, re\n4      LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                       PSKS, INC.                        \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\nquested that Kay\u2019s Kloset cease discounting. Its request\nrefused, Leegin stopped selling to the store. The loss of\nthe Brighton brand had a considerable negative impact on\nthe store\u2019s revenue from sales.\n  PSKS sued Leegin in the United States District Court\nfor the Eastern District of Texas. It alleged, among other\nclaims, that Leegin had violated the antitrust laws by\n\u201center[ing] into agreements with retailers to charge only\nthose prices fixed by Leegin.\u201d Id., at 1236. Leegin\nplanned to introduce expert testimony describing the\nprocompetitive effects of its pricing policy. The District\nCourt excluded the testimony, relying on the per se rule\nestablished by Dr. Miles. At trial PSKS argued that the\nHeart Store program, among other things, demonstrated\nLeegin and its retailers had agreed to fix prices. Leegin\nresponded that it had established a unilateral pricing\npolicy lawful under \u00a71, which applies only to concerted\naction. See United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U. S. 300,\n307 (1919). The jury agreed with PSKS and awarded it\n$1.2 million. Pursuant to 15 U. S. C. \u00a715(a), the District\nCourt trebled the damages and reimbursed PSKS for its\nattorney\u2019s fees and costs. It entered judgment against\nLeegin in the amount of $3,975,000.80.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 171\nFed. Appx. 464 (2006) (per curiam). On appeal Leegin did\nnot dispute that it had entered into vertical price-fixing\nagreements with its retailers. Rather, it contended that\nthe rule of reason should have applied to those agree\nments. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument. Id.,\nat 466\u2013467. It was correct to explain that it remained\nbound by Dr. Miles \u201c[b]ecause [the Supreme] Court has\nconsistently applied the per se rule to [vertical minimum\nprice-fixing] agreements.\u201d 171 Fed. Appx., at 466. On this\npremise the Court of Appeals held that the District Court\ndid not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony of\nLeegin\u2019s economic expert, for the per se rule rendered\n                  Cite as: 551 U.

Rather, the Court has repeated time and\nagain that \u00a71 \u201coutlaw[s] only unreasonable restraints.\u201d\nState Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 10 (1997).\n   The rule of reason is the accepted standard for testing\nwhether a practice restrains trade in violation of \u00a71. See\nTexaco, supra, at 5. \u201cUnder this rule, the factfinder\nweighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding\nwhether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as\nimposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.\u201d\nContinental T.

Appropriate factors to take into account include\n\u201cspecific information about the relevant business\u201d and \u201cthe\nrestraint\u2019s history, nature, and effect.\u201d Khan, supra, at 10.\nWhether the businesses involved have market power is a\nfurther, significant consideration.

Some\ntypes \u201care deemed unlawful per se.\u201d Khan, supra, at 10.\nThe per se rule, treating categories of restraints as neces\nsarily illegal, eliminates the need to study the reasonable\nness of an individual restraint in light of the real market\nforces at work, Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Elec\ntronics Corp., 485 U. S. 717, 723 (1988); and, it must be\nacknowledged, the per se rule can give clear guidance for\ncertain conduct. Restraints that are per se unlawful in\nclude horizontal agreements among competitors to fix\nprices, see Texaco, supra, at 5, or to divide markets, see\nPalmer v. BRG of Ga., Inc., 498 U. S. 46, 49\u201350 (1990) (per\ncuriam).\n  Resort to per se rules is confined to restraints, like those\nmentioned, \u201cthat would always or almost always tend to\nrestrict competition and decrease output.\u201d Business Elec\ntronics, supra, at 723 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nTo justify a per se prohibition a restraint must have\n\u201cmanifestly anticompetitive\u201d effects, GTE Sylvania, supra,\nat 50, and \u201clack . . . any redeeming virtue,\u201d Northwest\nWholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & Printing\nCo., 472 U. S. 284, 289 (1985) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n  As a consequence, the per se rule is appropriate only\nafter courts have had considerable experience with the\ntype of restraint at issue, see Broadcast Music, Inc. v.\nColumbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.

And, as we have stated,\na \u201cdeparture from the rule-of-reason standard must be\nbased upon demonstrable economic effect rather than . . .\nupon formalistic line drawing.\u201d GTE Sylvania, supra, at\n58\u201359.\n                             III\n   The Court has interpreted Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John\nD. Park & Sons Co., 220 U. S. 373 (1911), as establishing a\nper se rule against a vertical agreement between a manu\nfacturer and its distributor to set minimum resale prices.\nSee, e.g., Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465\nU. S. 752, 761 (1984). In Dr. Miles the plaintiff, a manu\nfacturer of medicines, sold its products only to distributors\nwho agreed to resell them at set prices. The Court found\nthe manufacturer\u2019s control of resale prices to be unlawful.\nIt relied on the common-law rule that \u201ca general restraint\nupon alienation is ordinarily invalid.\u201d 220 U. S., at 404\u2013\n405. The Court then explained that the agreements would\nadvantage the distributors, not the manufacturer, and\nwere analogous to a combination among competing dis\ntributors, which the law treated as void. Id., at 407\u2013408.\n   The reasoning of the Court\u2019s more recent jurisprudence\nhas rejected the rationales on which Dr. Miles was based.\nBy relying on the common-law rule against restraints on\nalienation, id., at 404\u2013405, the Court justified its decision\nbased on \u201cformalistic\u201d legal doctrine rather than \u201cdemon\nstrable economic effect,\u201d GTE Sylvania, supra, at 58\u201359.\nThe Court in Dr. Miles relied on a treatise published in\n8      LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                       PSKS, INC.                            \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n1628, but failed to discuss in detail the business reasons\nthat would motivate a manufacturer situated in 1911 to\nmake use of vertical price restraints. Yet the Sherman\nAct\u2019s use of \u201crestraint of trade\u201d \u201cinvokes the common law\nitself, . . . not merely the static content that the common\nlaw had assigned to the term in 1890.\u201d Business Electron\nics, supra, at 732. The general restraint on alienation,\nespecially in the age when then-Justice Hughes used the\nterm, tended to evoke policy concerns extraneous to the\nquestion that controls here. Usually associated with land,\nnot chattels, the rule arose from restrictions removing real\nproperty from the stream of commerce for generations.\nThe Court should be cautious about putting dispositive\nweight on doctrines from antiquity but of slight relevance.\nWe reaffirm that \u201cthe state of the common law 400 or even\n100 years ago is irrelevant to the issue before us: the effect\nof the antitrust laws upon vertical distributional re\nstraints in the American economy today.\u201d GTE Sylvania,\n433 U. S., at 53, n. 21 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Dr. Miles, furthermore, treated vertical agreements a\nmanufacturer makes with its distributors as analogous to\na horizontal combination among competing distributors.\nSee 220 U. S., at 407\u2013408. In later cases, however, the\nCourt rejected the approach of reliance on rules governing\nhorizontal restraints when defining rules applicable to\nvertical ones. See, e.g., Business Electronics, supra, at 734\n(disclaiming the \u201cnotion of equivalence between the scope\nof horizontal per se illegality and that of vertical per se\nillegality\u201d); Maricopa County, supra, at 348, n. 18 (noting\nthat \u201chorizontal restraints are generally less defensible\nthan vertical restraints\u201d). Our recent cases formulate\nantitrust principles in accordance with the appreciated\ndifferences in economic effect between vertical and hori\nzontal agreements, differences the Dr. Miles Court failed\nto consider.\n   The reasons upon which Dr. Miles relied do not justify a\n                  Cite as: 551 U.

As a consequence, it is necessary to examine,\nin the first instance, the economic effects of vertical\nagreements to fix minimum resale prices, and to deter\nmine whether the per se rule is nonetheless appropriate.\nSee Business Electronics, 485 U. S., at 726.\n                               A\n   Though each side of the debate can find sources to sup\nport its position, it suffices to say here that economics\nliterature is replete with procompetitive justifications for a\nmanufacturer\u2019s use of resale price maintenance. See, e.g.,\nBrief for Economists as Amici Curiae 16 (\u201cIn the theoreti\ncal literature, it is essentially undisputed that minimum\n[resale price maintenance] can have procompetitive effects\nand that under a variety of market conditions it is\nunlikely to have anticompetitive effects\u201d); Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 9 (\u201c[T]here is a widespread con\nsensus that permitting a manufacturer to control the price\nat which its goods are sold may promote interbrand com\npetition and consumer welfare in a variety of ways\u201d); ABA\nSection of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law and Economics of\nProduct Distribution 76 (2006) (\u201c[T]he bulk of the eco\nnomic literature on [resale price maintenance] suggests\nthat [it] is more likely to be used to enhance efficiency\nthan for anticompetitive purposes\u201d); see also H.

Bork, The\nAntitrust Paradox 288\u2013291 (1978) (hereinafter Bork).\nEven those more skeptical of resale price maintenance\nacknowledge it can have procompetitive effects. See, e.g.,\nBrief for William S. Comanor et al. as Amici Curiae 3\n(\u201c[G]iven [the] diversity of effects [of resale price mainte\nnance], one could reasonably take the position that a rule\nof reason rather than a per se approach is warranted\u201d);\nF.M.

See T. Overstreet, Resale Price Maintenance: Eco\nnomic Theories and Empirical Evidence 170 (1983) (here\ninafter Overstreet) (noting that \u201c[e]fficient uses of [resale\nprice maintenance] are evidently not unusual or rare\u201d); see\nalso Ippolito, Resale Price Maintenance: Empirical Evi\ndence From Litigation, 34 J. Law & Econ. 263, 292\u2013293\n(1991) (hereinafter Ippolito).\n  The justifications for vertical price restraints are similar\nto those for other vertical restraints. See GTE Sylvania,\n433 U. S., at 54\u201357. Minimum resale price maintenance\ncan stimulate interbrand competition\u2014the competition\namong manufacturers selling different brands of the same\ntype of product\u2014by reducing intrabrand competition\u2014the\ncompetition among retailers selling the same brand. See\nid., at 51\u201352. The promotion of interbrand competition is\nimportant because \u201cthe primary purpose of the antitrust\nlaws is to protect [this type of] competition.\u201d Khan, 522\nU. S., at 15. A single manufacturer\u2019s use of vertical price\nrestraints tends to eliminate intrabrand price competition;\nthis in turn encourages retailers to invest in tangible or\nintangible services or promotional efforts that aid the\nmanufacturer\u2019s position as against rival manufacturers.\nResale price maintenance also has the potential to give\nconsumers more options so that they can choose among\nlow-price, low-service brands; high-price, high-service\nbrands; and brands that fall in between.\n  Absent vertical price restraints, the retail services that\nenhance interbrand competition might be underprovided.\nThis is because discounting retailers can free ride on\nretailers who furnish services and then capture some of\nthe increased demand those services generate.

Consumers might learn, for example,\nabout the benefits of a manufacturer\u2019s product from a\nretailer that invests in fine showrooms, offers product\ndemonstrations, or hires and trains knowledgeable em\nployees. R. Posner, Antitrust Law 172\u2013173 (2d ed. 2001)\n(hereinafter Posner). Or consumers might decide to buy\nthe product because they see it in a retail establishment\nthat has a reputation for selling high-quality merchandise.\nMarvel & McCafferty, Resale Price Maintenance and\nQuality Certification, 15 Rand J. Econ. 346, 347\u2013349\n(1984) (hereinafter Marvel & McCafferty). If the con\nsumer can then buy the product from a retailer that dis\ncounts because it has not spent capital providing services\nor developing a quality reputation, the high-service re\ntailer will lose sales to the discounter, forcing it to cut\nback its services to a level lower than consumers would\notherwise prefer. Minimum resale price maintenance\nalleviates the problem because it prevents the discounter\nfrom undercutting the service provider. With price compe\ntition decreased, the manufacturer\u2019s retailers compete\namong themselves over services.\n   Resale price maintenance, in addition, can increase\ninterbrand competition by facilitating market entry for\nnew firms and brands. \u201c[N]ew manufacturers and manu\nfacturers entering new markets can use the restrictions in\norder to induce competent and aggressive retailers to\nmake the kind of investment of capital and labor that is\noften required in the distribution of products unknown to\nthe consumer.\u201d GTE Sylvania, supra, at 55; see Marvel &\nMcCafferty 349 (noting that reliance on a retailer\u2019s repu\ntation \u201cwill decline as the manufacturer\u2019s brand becomes\nbetter known, so that [resale price maintenance] may be\nparticularly important as a competitive device for new\nentrants\u201d). New products and new brands are essential to\na dynamic economy, and if markets can be penetrated by\nusing resale price maintenance there is a procompetitive\n12     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                       PSKS, INC.                          \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\neffect.\n   Resale price maintenance can also increase interbrand\ncompetition by encouraging retailer services that would\nnot be provided even absent free riding. It may be difficult\nand inefficient for a manufacturer to make and enforce a\ncontract with a retailer specifying the different services\nthe retailer must perform. Offering the retailer a guaran\nteed margin and threatening termination if it does not live\nup to expectations may be the most efficient way to ex\npand the manufacturer\u2019s market share by inducing the\nretailer\u2019s performance and allowing it to use its own initia\ntive and experience in providing valuable services. See\nMathewson & Winter, The Law and Economics of Resale\nPrice Maintenance, 13 Rev. Indus.

Resale price maintenance\nmay, for example, facilitate a manufacturer cartel. See\nBusiness Electronics, 485 U. S., at 725. An unlawful cartel\nwill seek to discover if some manufacturers are undercut\nting the cartel\u2019s fixed prices. Resale price maintenance\ncould assist the cartel in identifying price-cutting manu\nfacturers who benefit from the lower prices they offer.\n                  Cite as: 551 U.

See\nibid.; see also Posner 172; Overstreet 19\u201323.\n  Vertical price restraints also \u201cmight be used to organize\ncartels at the retailer level.\u201d Business Electronics, supra,\nat 725\u2013726. A group of retailers might collude to fix prices\nto consumers and then compel a manufacturer to aid the\nunlawful arrangement with resale price maintenance. In\nthat instance the manufacturer does not establish the\npractice to stimulate services or to promote its brand but\nto give inefficient retailers higher profits. Retailers with\nbetter distribution systems and lower cost structures\nwould be prevented from charging lower prices by the\nagreement. See Posner 172; Overstreet 13\u201319. Historical\nexamples suggest this possibility is a legitimate concern.\nSee, e.g., Marvel & McCafferty, The Welfare Effects of\nResale Price Maintenance, 28 J. Law & Econ. 363, 373\n(1985) (hereinafter Marvel) (providing an example of the\npower of the National Association of Retail Druggists to\ncompel manufacturers to use resale price maintenance);\nHovenkamp 186 (suggesting that the retail druggists in\nDr. Miles formed a cartel and used manufacturers to\nenforce it).\n  A horizontal cartel among competing manufacturers or\ncompeting retailers that decreases output or reduces\ncompetition in order to increase price is, and ought to be,\nper se unlawful. See Texaco, 547 U. S., at 5; GTE Sylva\nnia, 433 U. S., at 58, n. 28. To the extent a vertical\nagreement setting minimum resale prices is entered upon\nto facilitate either type of cartel, it, too, would need to be\nheld unlawful under the rule of reason. This type of\nagreement may also be useful evidence for a plaintiff\nattempting to prove the existence of a horizontal cartel.\n  Resale price maintenance, furthermore, can be abused\nby a powerful manufacturer or retailer. A dominant re\n14     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                       PSKS, INC.                          \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\ntailer, for example, might request resale price mainte\nnance to forestall innovation in distribution that decreases\ncosts. A manufacturer might consider it has little choice\nbut to accommodate the retailer\u2019s demands for vertical\nprice restraints if the manufacturer believes it needs\naccess to the retailer\u2019s distribution network.           See\nOverstreet 31; 8 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust\nLaw 47 (2d ed. 2004) (hereinafter Areeda & Hovenkamp);\ncf. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc. v. FTC, 221 F. 3d 928, 937\u2013938 (CA7\n2000). A manufacturer with market power, by compari\nson, might use resale price maintenance to give retailers\nan incentive not to sell the products of smaller rivals or\nnew entrants. See, e.g., Marvel 366\u2013368. As should\nbe evident, the potential anticompetitive consequences\nof vertical price restraints must not be ignored or\nunderestimated.\n                             C\n  Notwithstanding the risks of unlawful conduct, it cannot\nbe stated with any degree of confidence that resale price\nmaintenance \u201calways or almost always tend[s] to restrict\ncompetition and decrease output.\u201d Business Electronics,\nsupra, at 723 (internal quotation marks omitted). Vertical\nagreements establishing minimum resale prices can have\neither procompetitive or anticompetitive effects, depending\nupon the circumstances in which they are formed. And\nalthough the empirical evidence on the topic is limited, it\ndoes not suggest efficient uses of the agreements are\ninfrequent or hypothetical. See Overstreet 170; see also\nid., at 80 (noting that for the majority of enforcement\nactions brought by the Federal Trade Commission be\ntween 1965 and 1982, \u201cthe use of [resale price mainte\nnance] was not likely motivated by collusive dealers who\nhad successfully coerced their suppliers\u201d); Ippolito 292\n(reaching a similar conclusion). As the rule would pro\nscribe a significant amount of procompetitive conduct,\n                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthese agreements appear ill suited for per se condemna\ntion.\n   Respondent contends, nonetheless, that vertical price\nrestraints should be per se unlawful because of the admin\nistrative convenience of per se rules. See, e.g., GTE Sylva\nnia, supra, at 50, n. 16 (noting \u201cper se rules tend to provide\nguidance to the business community and to minimize the\nburdens on litigants and the judicial system\u201d). That ar\ngument suggests per se illegality is the rule rather than\nthe exception. This misinterprets our antitrust law. Per\nse rules may decrease administrative costs, but that is\nonly part of the equation. Those rules can be counterpro\nductive. They can increase the total cost of the antitrust\nsystem by prohibiting procompetitive conduct the anti\ntrust laws should encourage. See Easterbrook, Vertical\nArrangements and the Rule of Reason, 53 Antitrust L. J.\n135, 158 (1984) (hereinafter Easterbrook). They also may\nincrease litigation costs by promoting frivolous suits\nagainst legitimate practices. The Court has thus ex\nplained that administrative \u201cadvantages are not sufficient\nin themselves to justify the creation of per se rules,\u201d GTE\nSylvania, 433 U. S., at 50, n. 16, and has relegated their\nuse to restraints that are \u201cmanifestly anticompetitive,\u201d id.,\nat 49\u201350. Were the Court now to conclude that vertical\nprice restraints should be per se illegal based on adminis\ntrative costs, we would undermine, if not overrule, the\ntraditional \u201cdemanding standards\u201d for adopting per se\nrules. Id., at 50. Any possible reduction in administrative\ncosts cannot alone justify the Dr. Miles rule.\n   Respondent also argues the per se rule is justified be\ncause a vertical price restraint can lead to higher prices\nfor the manufacturer\u2019s goods. See also Overstreet 160\n(noting that \u201cprice surveys indicate that [resale price\nmaintenance] in most cases increased the prices of prod\nucts sold\u201d).

Cf. id., at 106 (explaining that price surveys \u201cdo not\nnecessarily tell us anything conclusive about the welfare\neffects of [resale price maintenance] because the results\nare generally consistent with both procompetitive and\nanticompetitive theories\u201d). For, as has been indicated\nalready, the antitrust laws are designed primarily to\nprotect interbrand competition, from which lower prices\ncan later result. See Khan, 522 U. S., at 15. The Court,\nmoreover, has evaluated other vertical restraints under\nthe rule of reason even though prices can be increased in\nthe course of promoting procompetitive effects. See, e.g.,\nBusiness Electronics, 485 U. S., at 728. And resale price\nmaintenance may reduce prices if manufacturers have\nresorted to costlier alternatives of controlling resale prices\nthat are not per se unlawful. See infra, at 22\u201325; see also\nMarvel 371.\n   Respondent\u2019s argument, furthermore, overlooks that, in\ngeneral, the interests of manufacturers and consumers are\naligned with respect to retailer profit margins. The differ\nence between the price a manufacturer charges retailers\nand the price retailers charge consumers represents part\nof the manufacturer\u2019s cost of distribution, which, like any\nother cost, the manufacturer usually desires to minimize.\nSee GTE Sylvania, 433 U. S., at 56, n. 24; see also id., at\n56 (\u201cEconomists . . . have argued that manufacturers have\nan economic interest in maintaining as much intrabrand\ncompetition as is consistent with the efficient distribution\nof their products\u201d). A manufacturer has no incentive to\novercompensate retailers with unjustified margins. The\nretailers, not the manufacturer, gain from higher retail\nprices. The manufacturer often loses; interbrand competi\ntion reduces its competitiveness and market share because\nconsumers will \u201csubstitute a different brand of the same\nproduct.\u201d Id., at 52, n. 19; see Business Electronics, supra,\nat 725. As a general matter, therefore, a single manufac\nturer will desire to set minimum resale prices only if the\n                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cincrease in demand resulting from enhanced service . . .\nwill more than offset a negative impact on demand of a\nhigher retail price.\u201d Mathewson & Winter 67.\n   The implications of respondent\u2019s position are far reach\ning. Many decisions a manufacturer makes and carries\nout through concerted action can lead to higher prices. A\nmanufacturer might, for example, contract with different\nsuppliers to obtain better inputs that improve product\nquality. Or it might hire an advertising agency to promote\nawareness of its goods. Yet no one would think these\nactions violate the Sherman Act because they lead to\nhigher prices. The antitrust laws do not require manufac\nturers to produce generic goods that consumers do not\nknow about or want. The manufacturer strives to improve\nits product quality or to promote its brand because it\nbelieves this conduct will lead to increased demand de\nspite higher prices. The same can hold true for resale\nprice maintenance.\n   Resale price maintenance, it is true, does have economic\ndangers. If the rule of reason were to apply to vertical\nprice restraints, courts would have to be diligent in elimi\nnating their anticompetitive uses from the market. This is\na realistic objective, and certain factors are relevant to the\ninquiry. For example, the number of manufacturers that\nmake use of the practice in a given industry can provide\nimportant instruction. When only a few manufacturers\nlacking market power adopt the practice, there is little\nlikelihood it is facilitating a manufacturer cartel, for a\ncartel then can be undercut by rival manufacturers. See\nOverstreet 22; Bork 294. Likewise, a retailer cartel is\nunlikely when only a single manufacturer in a competitive\nmarket uses resale price maintenance. Interbrand compe\ntition would divert consumers to lower priced substitutes\nand eliminate any gains to retailers from their price-fixing\nagreement over a single brand. See Posner 172; Bork 292.\nResale price maintenance should be subject to more care\n18     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                       PSKS, INC.                            \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\nful scrutiny, by contrast, if many competing manufactur\ners adopt the practice. Cf. Scherer & Ross 558 (noting\nthat \u201cexcept when [resale price maintenance] spreads to\ncover the bulk of an industry\u2019s output, depriving consum\ners of a meaningful choice between high-service and low-\nprice outlets, most [resale price maintenance arrange\nments] are probably innocuous\u201d); Easterbrook 162 (sug\ngesting that \u201cevery one of the potentially-anticompetitive\noutcomes of vertical arrangements depends on the uni\nformity of the practice\u201d).\n   The source of the restraint may also be an important\nconsideration. If there is evidence retailers were the\nimpetus for a vertical price restraint, there is a greater\nlikelihood that the restraint facilitates a retailer cartel or\nsupports a dominant, inefficient retailer. See Brief for\nWilliam S. Comanor et al. as Amici Curiae 7\u20138. If, by\ncontrast, a manufacturer adopted the policy independent\nof retailer pressure, the restraint is less likely to promote\nanticompetitive conduct. Cf. Posner 177 (\u201cIt makes all the\ndifference whether minimum retail prices are imposed by\nthe manufacturer in order to evoke point-of-sale services\nor by the dealers in order to obtain monopoly profits\u201d). A\nmanufacturer also has an incentive to protest inefficient\nretailer-induced price restraints because they can harm its\ncompetitive position.\n   As a final matter, that a dominant manufacturer or\nretailer can abuse resale price maintenance for anticom\npetitive purposes may not be a serious concern unless the\nrelevant entity has market power. If a retailer lacks\nmarket power, manufacturers likely can sell their goods\nthrough rival retailers. See also Business Electronics,\nsupra, at 727, n. 2 (noting \u201c[r]etail market power is rare,\nbecause of the usual presence of interbrand competition\nand other dealers\u201d). And if a manufacturer lacks market\npower, there is less likelihood it can use the practice to\nkeep competitors away from distribution outlets.\n                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The rule of reason is designed and used to eliminate\nanticompetitive transactions from the market. This stan\ndard principle applies to vertical price restraints. A party\nalleging injury from a vertical agreement setting mini\nmum resale prices will have, as a general matter, the\ninformation and resources available to show the existence\nof the agreement and its scope of operation. As courts\ngain experience considering the effects of these restraints\nby applying the rule of reason over the course of decisions,\nthey can establish the litigation structure to ensure the\nrule operates to eliminate anticompetitive restraints from\nthe market and to provide more guidance to businesses.\nCourts can, for example, devise rules over time for offering\nproof, or even presumptions where justified, to make the\nrule of reason a fair and efficient way to prohibit anticom\npetitive restraints and to promote procompetitive ones.\n  For all of the foregoing reasons, we think that were the\nCourt considering the issue as an original matter, the rule\nof reason, not a per se rule of unlawfulness, would be the\nappropriate standard to judge vertical price restraints.\n                              IV\n   We do not write on a clean slate, for the decision in Dr.\nMiles is almost a century old. So there is an argument for\nits retention on the basis of stare decisis alone. Even if Dr.\nMiles established an erroneous rule, \u201c[s]tare decisis re\nflects a policy judgment that in most matters it is more\nimportant that the applicable rule of law be settled than\nthat it be settled right.\u201d Khan, 522 U. S., at 20 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). And concerns about maintain\ning settled law are strong when the question is one of\nstatutory interpretation. See, e.g., Hohn v. United States,\n524 U. S. 236, 251 (1998).\n   Stare decisis is not as significant in this case, however,\nbecause the issue before us is the scope of the Sherman\nAct. Khan, supra, at 20 (\u201c[T]he general presumption that\n20     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                       PSKS, INC.                            \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\nlegislative changes should be left to Congress has less\nforce with respect to the Sherman Act\u201d). From the begin\nning the Court has treated the Sherman Act as a common-\nlaw statute. See National Soc. of Professional Engineers v.\nUnited States, 435 U. S. 679, 688 (1978); see also North\nwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U. S. 77, 98,\nn. 42 (1981) (\u201cIn antitrust, the federal courts . . . act more\nas common-law courts than in other areas governed by\nfederal statute\u201d). Just as the common law adapts to mod\nern understanding and greater experience, so too does the\nSherman Act\u2019s prohibition on \u201crestraint[s] of trade\u201d evolve\nto meet the dynamics of present economic conditions. The\ncase-by-case adjudication contemplated by the rule of\nreason has implemented this common-law approach. See\nNational Soc. of Professional Engineers, supra, at 688.\nLikewise, the boundaries of the doctrine of per se illegality\nshould not be immovable. For \u201c[i]t would make no sense\nto create out of the single term \u2018restraint of trade\u2019 a\nchronologically schizoid statute, in which a \u2018rule of reason\u2019\nevolves with new circumstance and new wisdom, but a line\nof per se illegality remains forever fixed where it was.\u201d\nBusiness Electronics, 485 U. S., at 732.\n                             A\n  Stare decisis, we conclude, does not compel our contin\nued adherence to the per se rule against vertical price\nrestraints. As discussed earlier, respected authorities in\nthe economics literature suggest the per se rule is inap\npropriate, and there is now widespread agreement that\nresale price maintenance can have procompetitive effects.\nSee, e.g., Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae 16. It is\nalso significant that both the Department of Justice and\nthe Federal Trade Commission\u2014the antitrust enforce\nment agencies with the ability to assess the long-term\nimpacts of resale price maintenance\u2014have recommended\nthat this Court replace the per se rule with the traditional\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

In the antitrust context the fact that a decision\nhas been \u201ccalled into serious question\u201d justifies our re\nevaluation of it.

Shearson/American Ex\npress, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 480\u2013481 (1989) (same). This is\nunsurprising, for the case was decided not long after en\nactment of the Sherman Act when the Court had little\nexperience with antitrust analysis. Only eight years after\nDr. Miles, moreover, the Court reined in the decision by\nholding that a manufacturer can announce suggested\nresale prices and refuse to deal with distributors who do\nnot follow them. Colgate, 250 U. S., at 307\u2013308.\n  In more recent cases the Court, following a common-law\napproach, has continued to temper, limit, or overrule once\nstrict prohibitions on vertical restraints. In 1977, the\nCourt overturned the per se rule for vertical nonprice\nrestraints, adopting the rule of reason in its stead. GTE\nSylvania, 433 U. S., at 57\u201359 (overruling United States v.\nArnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U. S. 365 (1967)); see also 433\nU. S., at 58, n. 29 (noting \u201cthat the advantages of vertical\nrestrictions should not be limited to the categories of new\nentrants and failing firms\u201d). While the Court in a footnote\nin GTE Sylvania suggested that differences between\nvertical price and nonprice restraints could support differ\nent legal treatment, see 433 U. S., at 51, n. 18, the central\n22     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                       PSKS, INC.                           \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\npart of the opinion relied on authorities and arguments\nthat find unequal treatment \u201cdifficult to justify,\u201d id., at\n69\u201370 (White, J., concurring in judgment).\n   Continuing in this direction, in two cases in the 1980\u2019s\nthe Court defined legal rules to limit the reach of Dr. Miles\nand to accommodate the doctrines enunciated in GTE\nSylvania and Colgate. See Business Electronics, supra, at\n726\u2013728; Monsanto, 465 U. S., at 763\u2013764. In Monsanto,\nthe Court required that antitrust plaintiffs alleging a \u00a71\nprice-fixing conspiracy must present evidence tending to\nexclude the possibility a manufacturer and its distributors\nacted in an independent manner. Id., at 764. Unlike\nJustice Brennan\u2019s concurrence, which rejected arguments\nthat Dr. Miles should be overruled, see 465 U. S., at 769,\nthe Court \u201cdecline[d] to reach the question\u201d whether verti\ncal agreements fixing resale prices always should be\nunlawful because neither party suggested otherwise, id.,\nat 761\u2013762, n. 7. In Business Electronics the Court fur\nther narrowed the scope of Dr. Miles. It held that the per\nse rule applied only to specific agreements over price levels\nand not to an agreement between a manufacturer and a\ndistributor to terminate a price-cutting distributor. 485\nU. S., at 726\u2013727, 735\u2013736.\n   Most recently, in 1997, after examining the issue of\nvertical maximum price-fixing agreements in light of\ncommentary and real experience, the Court overruled a\n29-year-old precedent treating those agreements as per se\nillegal. Khan, 522 U. S., at 22 (overruling Albrecht v.\nHerald Co., 390 U. S. 145 (1968)). It held instead that\nthey should be evaluated under the traditional rule of\nreason. 522 U. S., at 22. Our continued limiting of the\nreach of the decision in Dr. Miles and our recent treatment\nof other vertical restraints justify the conclusion that Dr.\nMiles should not be retained.\n   The Dr. Miles rule is also inconsistent with a principled\nframework, for it makes little economic sense when ana\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlyzed with our other cases on vertical restraints. If we\nwere to decide the procompetitive effects of resale price\nmaintenance were insufficient to overrule Dr. Miles, then\ncases such as Colgate and GTE Sylvania themselves\nwould be called into question. These later decisions, while\nthey may result in less intrabrand competition, can be\njustified because they permit manufacturers to secure the\nprocompetitive benefits associated with vertical price\nrestraints through other methods. The other methods,\nhowever, could be less efficient for a particular manufac\nturer to establish and sustain. The end result hinders\ncompetition and consumer welfare because manufacturers\nare forced to engage in second-best alternatives and be\ncause consumers are required to shoulder the increased\nexpense of the inferior practices.\n   The manufacturer has a number of legitimate options to\nachieve benefits similar to those provided by vertical price\nrestraints. A manufacturer can exercise its Colgate right\nto refuse to deal with retailers that do not follow its sug\ngested prices. See 250 U. S., at 307. The economic effects\nof unilateral and concerted price setting are in general the\nsame. See, e.g., Monsanto, 465 U. S., at 762\u2013764. The\nproblem for the manufacturer is that a jury might con\nclude its unilateral policy was really a vertical agreement,\nsubjecting it to treble damages and potential criminal\nliability. Ibid.; Business Electronics, supra, at 728. Even\nwith the stringent standards in Monsanto and Business\nElectronics, this danger can lead, and has led, rational\nmanufacturers to take wasteful measures. See, e.g., Brief\nfor PING, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 9\u201318. A manufacturer\nmight refuse to discuss its pricing policy with its distribu\ntors except through counsel knowledgeable of the subtle\nintricacies of the law. Or it might terminate longstanding\ndistributors for minor violations without seeking an ex\nplanation. See ibid. The increased costs these burden\nsome measures generate flow to consumers in the form of\n24     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                       PSKS, INC.                           \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\nhigher prices.\n   Furthermore, depending on the type of product it sells, a\nmanufacturer might be able to achieve the procompetitive\nbenefits of resale price maintenance by integrating down\nstream and selling its products directly to consumers. Dr.\nMiles tilts the relative costs of vertical integration and\nvertical agreement by making the former more attractive\nbased on the per se rule, not on real market conditions.\nSee Business Electronics, supra, at 725; see generally\nCoase, The Nature of the Firm, 4 Economica, New Series\n386 (1937). This distortion might lead to inefficient inte\ngration that would not otherwise take place, so that con\nsumers must again suffer the consequences of the subop\ntimal distribution strategy.        And integration, unlike\nvertical price restraints, eliminates all intrabrand compe\ntition. See, e.g., GTE Sylvania, 433 U. S., at 57, n. 26.\n   There is yet another consideration. A manufacturer can\nimpose territorial restrictions on distributors and allow\nonly one distributor to sell its goods in a given region. Our\ncases have recognized, and the economics literature con\nfirms, that these vertical nonprice restraints have impacts\nsimilar to those of vertical price restraints; both reduce\nintrabrand competition and can stimulate retailer ser\nvices. See, e.g., Business Electronics, supra, at 728; Mon\nsanto, supra, at 762\u2013763; see also Brief for Economists as\nAmici Curiae 17\u201318. Cf. Scherer & Ross 560 (noting that\nvertical nonprice restraints \u201ccan engender inefficiencies at\nleast as serious as those imposed upon the consumer by\nresale price maintenance\u201d); Steiner, How Manufacturers\nDeal with the Price-Cutting Retailer: When Are Vertical\nRestraints Efficient?, 65 Antitrust L. J. 407, 446\u2013447\n(1997) (indicating that \u201cantitrust law should recognize\nthat the consumer interest is often better served by [resale\nprice maintenance]\u2014contrary to its per se illegality and\nthe rule-of-reason status of vertical nonprice restraints\u201d).\nThe same legal standard (per se unlawfulness) applies to\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhorizontal market division and horizontal price fixing\nbecause both have similar economic effect. There is like\nwise little economic justification for the current differen\ntial treatment of vertical price and nonprice restraints.\nFurthermore, vertical nonprice restraints may prove less\nefficient for inducing desired services, and they reduce\nintrabrand competition more than vertical price restraints\nby eliminating both price and service competition. See\nBrief for Economists as Amici Curiae 17\u201318.\n   In sum, it is a flawed antitrust doctrine that serves the\ninterests of lawyers\u2014by creating legal distinctions that\noperate as traps for the unwary\u2014more than the interests\nof consumers\u2014by requiring manufacturers to choose\nsecond-best options to achieve sound business objectives.\n                             B\n  Respondent\u2019s arguments for reaffirming Dr. Miles on the\nbasis of stare decisis do not require a different result.\nRespondent looks to congressional action concerning verti\ncal price restraints. In 1937, Congress passed the Miller-\nTydings Fair Trade Act, 50 Stat. 693, which made vertical\nprice restraints legal if authorized by a fair trade law\nenacted by a State. Fifteen years later, Congress ex\npanded the exemption to permit vertical price-setting\nagreements between a manufacturer and a distributor to\nbe enforced against other distributors not involved in the\nagreement. McGuire Act, 66 Stat. 632. In 1975, however,\nCongress repealed both Acts. Consumer Goods Pricing\nAct, 89 Stat. 801. That the Dr. Miles rule applied to verti\ncal price restraints in 1975, according to respondent,\nshows Congress ratified the rule.\n  This is not so. The text of the Consumer Goods Pricing\nAct did not codify the rule of per se illegality for vertical\nprice restraints. It rescinded statutory provisions that\nmade them per se legal. Congress once again placed these\nrestraints within the ambit of \u00a71 of the Sherman Act.\n26     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                       PSKS, INC.                            \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\nAnd, as has been discussed, Congress intended \u00a71 to give\ncourts the ability \u201cto develop governing principles of law\u201d\nin the common-law tradition. Texas Industries, Inc. v.\nRadcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 643 (1981); see\nBusiness Electronics, 485 U. S., at 731 (\u201cThe changing\ncontent of the term \u2018restraint of trade\u2019 was well recognized\nat the time the Sherman Act was enacted\u201d). Congress\ncould have set the Dr. Miles rule in stone, but it chose a\nmore flexible option. We respect its decision by analyzing\nvertical price restraints, like all restraints, in conformance\nwith traditional \u00a71 principles, including the principle that\nour antitrust doctrines \u201cevolv[e] with new circumstances\nand new wisdom.\u201d Business Electronics, supra, at 732; see\nalso Easterbrook 139.\n   The rule of reason, furthermore, is not inconsistent with\nthe Consumer Goods Pricing Act. Unlike the earlier con\ngressional exemption, it does not treat vertical price re\nstraints as per se legal. In this respect, the justifications\nfor the prior exemption are illuminating. Its goal \u201cwas to\nallow the States to protect small retail establishments\nthat Congress thought might otherwise be driven from the\nmarketplace by large-volume discounters.\u201d California\nRetail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445\nU. S. 97, 102 (1980). The state fair trade laws also appear\nto have been justified on similar grounds. See Areeda &\nHovenkamp 298. The rationales for these provisions are\nforeign to the Sherman Act. Divorced from competition\nand consumer welfare, they were designed to save ineffi\ncient small retailers from their inability to compete. The\npurpose of the antitrust laws, by contrast, is \u201cthe protec\ntion of competition, not competitors.\u201d Atlantic Richfield\nCo. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U. S. 328, 338 (1990) (in\nternal quotation marks omitted). To the extent Congress\nrepealed the exemption for some vertical price restraints\nto end its prior practice of encouraging anticompetitive\nconduct, the rule of reason promotes the same objective.\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondent also relies on several congressional appro\npriations in the mid-1980\u2019s in which Congress did not\npermit the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade\nCommission to use funds to advocate overturning Dr.\nMiles. See, e.g., 97 Stat. 1071. We need not pause long in\naddressing this argument. The conditions on funding are\nno longer in place, see, e.g., Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 21, and they were ambiguous at best. As\nmuch as they might show congressional approval for Dr.\nMiles, they might demonstrate a different proposition:\nthat Congress could not pass legislation codifying the rule\nand reached a short-term compromise instead.\n   Reliance interests do not require us to reaffirm Dr.\nMiles. To be sure, reliance on a judicial opinion is a sig\nnificant reason to adhere to it, Payne v. Tennessee, 501\nU. S. 808, 828 (1991), especially \u201cin cases involving prop\nerty and contract rights,\u201d Khan, 522 U. S., at 20. The\nreliance interests here, however, like the reliance interests\nin Khan, cannot justify an inefficient rule, especially\nbecause the narrowness of the rule has allowed manufac\nturers to set minimum resale prices in other ways. And\nwhile the Dr. Miles rule is longstanding, resale price\nmaintenance was legal under fair trade laws in a majority\nof States for a large part of the past century up until 1975.\n   It is also of note that during this time \u201cwhen the legal\nenvironment in the [United States] was most favorable for\n[resale price maintenance], no more than a tiny fraction of\nmanufacturers ever employed [resale price maintenance]\ncontracts.\u201d Overstreet 6; see also id., at 169 (noting that\n\u201cno more than one percent of manufacturers, accounting\nfor no more than ten percent of consumer goods purchases,\never employed [resale price maintenance] in any single\nyear in the [United States]\u201d); Scherer & Ross 549 (noting\nthat \u201c[t]he fraction of U.S. retail sales covered by [resale\nprice maintenance] in its heyday has been variously esti\nmated at from 4 to 10 percent\u201d).

John D. Park & Sons Co.,\n220 U. S. 373, 394, 408\u2013409 (1911), this Court held that\nan agreement between a manufacturer of proprietary\nmedicines and its dealers to fix the minimum price at\nwhich its medicines could be sold was \u201cinvalid . . . under\nthe [Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71].\u201d This Court has consis\ntently read Dr. Miles as establishing a bright-line rule\nthat agreements fixing minimum resale prices are per se\nillegal. See, e.g., United States v. Trenton Potteries Co.,\n273 U. S. 392, 399\u2013401 (1927); NYNEX Corp. v. Discon,\nInc., 525 U. S. 128, 133 (1998). That per se rule is one\nupon which the legal profession, business, and the public\nhave relied for close to a century. Today the Court holds\nthat courts must determine the lawfulness of minimum\nresale price maintenance by applying, not a bright-line per\nse rule, but a circumstance-specific \u201crule of reason.\u201d Ante,\nat 28. And in doing so it overturns Dr. Miles.\n   The Court justifies its departure from ordinary consid\nerations of stare decisis by pointing to a set of arguments\nwell known in the antitrust literature for close to half a\ncentury. See ante, at 10\u201312. Congress has repeatedly\n2      LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                      PSKS, INC.                             \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nfound in these arguments insufficient grounds for over\nturning the per se rule. See, e.g., Hearings on H. R. 10527\net al. before the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance\nof the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Com\nmerce, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 74\u201376, 89, 99, 101\u2013102, 192\u2013\n195, 261\u2013262 (1958). And, in my view, they do not war\nrant the Court\u2019s now overturning so well-established a\nlegal precedent.\n                              I\n   The Sherman Act seeks to maintain a marketplace free\nof anticompetitive practices, in particular those enforced\nby agreement among private firms. The law assumes that\nsuch a marketplace, free of private restrictions, will tend\nto bring about the lower prices, better products, and more\nefficient production processes that consumers typically\ndesire. In determining the lawfulness of particular prac\ntices, courts often apply a \u201crule of reason.\u201d They examine\nboth a practice\u2019s likely anticompetitive effects and its\nbeneficial business justifications. See, e.g., National Col\nlegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla.,\n468 U. S. 85, 109\u2013110, and n. 39 (1984); National Soc. of\nProfessional Engineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679,\n688\u2013691 (1978); Board of Trade of Chicago v. United\nStates, 246 U. S. 231, 238 (1918).\n   Nonetheless, sometimes the likely anticompetitive\nconsequences of a particular practice are so serious and\nthe potential justifications so few (or, e.g., so difficult to\nprove) that courts have departed from a pure \u201crule of\nreason\u201d approach. And sometimes this Court has imposed\na rule of per se unlawfulness\u2014a rule that instructs courts\nto find the practice unlawful all (or nearly all) the time.\nSee, e.g., NYNEX, supra, at 133; Arizona v. Maricopa\nCounty Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 343\u2013344, and n. 16\n(1982); Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433\nU. S. 36, 50, n. 16 (1977); United States v.

S. 150, 213\u2013214 (1940)\n(citing and quoting Trenton Potteries, supra, at 397\u2013398).\n   The case before us asks which kind of approach the\ncourts should follow where minimum resale price mainte\nnance is at issue. Should they apply a per se rule (or a\nvariation) that would make minimum resale price mainte\nnance always (or almost always) unlawful? Should they\napply a \u201crule of reason\u201d? Were the Court writing on a\nblank slate, I would find these questions difficult. But, of\ncourse, the Court is not writing on a blank slate, and that\nfact makes a considerable legal difference.\n   To best explain why the question would be difficult were\nwe deciding it afresh, I briefly summarize several classical\narguments for and against the use of a per se rule. The\narguments focus on three sets of considerations, those\ninvolving: (1) potential anticompetitive effects, (2) poten\ntial benefits, and (3) administration. The difficulty arises\nout of the fact that the different sets of considerations\npoint in different directions. See, e.g., 8 P.

Rev. 983, 990\u20131000 (1985).\n   In respect to producers: Resale price maintenance agree\nments can help to reinforce the competition-inhibiting\nbehavior of firms in concentrated industries. In such\nindustries firms may tacitly collude, i.e., observe each\nother\u2019s pricing behavior, each understanding that price\ncutting by one firm is likely to trigger price competition by\nall.

In either case,\nresale price maintenance agreements will tend to prevent\nprice competition from \u201cbreaking out\u201d; and they will\nthereby tend to stabilize producer prices. See Pitofsky\n1490\u20131491. Cf., e.g., Container Corp., supra, at 336\u2013337.\n  Those who express concern about the potential anticom\npetitive effects find empirical support in the behavior of\nprices before, and then after, Congress in 1975 repealed\nthe Miller-Tydings Fair Trade Act, 50 Stat. 693, and the\nMcGuire Act, 66 Stat. 631. Those Acts had permitted (but\nnot required) individual States to enact \u201cfair trade\u201d laws\nauthorizing minimum resale price maintenance. At the\ntime of repeal minimum resale price maintenance was\nlawful in 36 States; it was unlawful in 14 States. See\nHearings on S. 408 before the Subcommittee on Antitrust\nand Monopoly of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n94th Cong., 1st Sess., 173 (1975) (hereinafter Hearings on\nS. 408) (statement of Thomas E. Kauper, Assistant Attor\nney General, Antitrust Division). Comparing prices in the\nformer States with prices in the latter States, the Depart\nment of Justice argued that minimum resale price main\ntenance had raised prices by 19% to 27%. See Hearings on\nH. R. 2384 before the Subcommittee on Monopolies and\nCommercial Law of the House Committee on the Judici\nary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 122 (1975) (hereinafter Hear\nings on H. R. 2384) (statement of Keith I. Clearwaters,\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division).\n  After repeal, minimum resale price maintenance agree\nments were unlawful per se in every State. The Federal\nTrade Commission (FTC) staff, after studying numerous\nprice surveys, wrote that collectively the surveys \u201cindi\ncate[d] that [resale price maintenance] in most cases\nincreased the prices of products sold with [resale price\nmaintenance].\u201d Bureau of Economics Staff Report to the\n6      LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                      PSKS, INC.                            \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nFTC, T.

Most economists today agree that, in the\nwords of a prominent antitrust treatise, \u201cresale price\nmaintenance tends to produce higher consumer prices\nthan would otherwise be the case.\u201d 8 Areeda & Hovenk\namp \u00b61604b, at 40 (finding \u201c[t]he evidence . . . persuasive\non this point\u201d). See also Brief for William S. Comanor and\nFrederic M. Scherer as Amici Curiae 4 (\u201cIt is uniformly\nacknowledged that [resale price maintenance] and other\nvertical restraints lead to higher consumer prices\u201d).\n  On the other hand, those favoring resale price mainte\nnance have long argued that resale price maintenance\nagreements can provide important consumer benefits.\nThe majority lists two: First, such agreements can facili\ntate new entry. Ante, at 11\u201312. For example, a newly\nentering producer wishing to build a product name might\nbe able to convince dealers to help it do so\u2014if, but only if,\nthe producer can assure those dealers that they will later\nrecoup their investment. Without resale price mainte\nnance, late-entering dealers might take advantage of the\nearlier investment and, through price competition, drive\nprices down to the point where the early dealers cannot\nrecover what they spent. By assuring the initial dealers\nthat such later price competition will not occur, resale\nprice maintenance can encourage them to carry the new\nproduct, thereby helping the new producer succeed. See 8\nAreeda & Hovenkamp \u00b6\u00b61617a, 1631b, at 193\u2013196, 308.\nThe result might be increased competition at the producer\nlevel, i.e., greater inter-brand competition, that brings\nwith it net consumer benefits.\n  Second, without resale price maintenance a producer\nmight find its efforts to sell a product undermined by what\nresale price maintenance advocates call \u201cfree riding.\u201d\nAnte, at 10\u201311. Suppose a producer concludes that it can\nsucceed only if dealers provide certain services, say, prod\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nuct demonstrations, high quality shops, advertising that\ncreates a certain product image, and so forth. Without\nresale price maintenance, some dealers might take a \u201cfree\nride\u201d on the investment that others make in providing\nthose services. Such a dealer would save money by not\npaying for those services and could consequently cut its\nown price and increase its own sales. Under these circum\nstances, dealers might prove unwilling to invest in the\nprovision of necessary services. See, e.g., 8 Areeda &\nHovenkamp \u00b6\u00b61611\u20131613, 1631c, at 126\u2013165, 309\u2013313; R.\nPosner, Antitrust Law 172\u2013173 (2d ed. 2001); R. Bork, The\nAntitrust Paradox 290\u2013291 (1978) (hereinafter Bork);\nEasterbrook 146\u2013149.\n   Moreover, where a producer and not a group of dealers\nseeks a resale price maintenance agreement, there is a\nspecial reason to believe some such benefits exist. That is\nbecause, other things being equal, producers should want\nto encourage price competition among their dealers. By\ndoing so they will often increase profits by selling more of\ntheir product. See Sylvania, 433 U. S., at 56, n. 24; Bork\n290. And that is so, even if the producer possesses suffi\ncient market power to earn a super-normal profit. That is\nto say, other things being equal, the producer will benefit\nby charging his dealers a competitive (or even a higher-\nthan-competitive) wholesale price while encouraging price\ncompetition among them. Hence, if the producer is the\nmoving force, the producer must have some special reason\nfor wanting resale price maintenance; and in the absence\nof, say, concentrated producer markets (where that special\nreason might consist of a desire to stabilize wholesale\nprices), that special reason may well reflect the special\ncircumstances just described: new entry, \u201cfree riding,\u201d or\nvariations on those themes.\n   The upshot is, as many economists suggest, sometimes\nresale price maintenance can prove harmful; sometimes it\ncan bring benefits. See, e.g., Brief for Economists as Amici\n8      LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                      PSKS, INC.                             \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nCuriae 16; 8 Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b6\u00b61631\u20131632, at 306\u2013\n328; Pitofsky 1495; Scherer 706\u2013707. But before conclud\ning that courts should consequently apply a rule of reason,\nI would ask such questions as, how often are harms or\nbenefits likely to occur? How easy is it to separate the\nbeneficial sheep from the antitrust goats?\n   Economic discussion, such as the studies the Court\nrelies upon, can help provide answers to these questions,\nand in doing so, economics can, and should, inform anti\ntrust law. But antitrust law cannot, and should not,\nprecisely replicate economists\u2019 (sometimes conflicting)\nviews. That is because law, unlike economics, is an ad\nministrative system the effects of which depend upon the\ncontent of rules and precedents only as they are applied by\njudges and juries in courts and by lawyers advising their\nclients. And that fact means that courts will often bring\ntheir own administrative judgment to bear, sometimes\napplying rules of per se unlawfulness to business practices\neven when those practices sometimes produce benefits.\nSee, e.g., F.M. Scherer & D. Ross, Industrial Market\nStructure and Economic Performance 335\u2013339 (3d ed.\n1990) (hereinafter Scherer & Ross) (describing some cir\ncumstances under which price-fixing agreements could be\nmore beneficial than \u201cunfettered competition,\u201d but also\nnoting potential costs of moving from a per se ban to a rule\nof reasonableness assessment of such agreements).\n   I have already described studies and analyses that\nsuggest (though they cannot prove) that resale price main\ntenance can cause harms with some regularity\u2014and\ncertainly when dealers are the driving force. But what\nabout benefits? How often, for example, will the benefits\nto which the Court points occur in practice? I can find no\neconomic consensus on this point. There is a consensus in\nthe literature that \u201cfree riding\u201d takes place. But \u201cfree\nriding\u201d often takes place in the economy without any legal\neffort to stop it. Many visitors to California take free rides\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            9\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\non the Pacific Coast Highway. We all benefit freely from\nideas, such as that of creating the first supermarket.\nDealers often take a \u201cfree ride\u201d on investments that others\nhave made in building a product\u2019s name and reputation.\nThe question is how often the \u201cfree riding\u201d problem is\nserious enough significantly to deter dealer investment.\n   To be more specific, one can easily imagine a dealer who\nrefuses to provide important presale services, say a de\ntailed explanation of how a product works (or who fails to\nprovide a proper atmosphere in which to sell expensive\nperfume or alligator billfolds), lest customers use that\n\u201cfree\u201d service (or enjoy the psychological benefit arising\nwhen a high-priced retailer stocks a particular brand of\nbillfold or handbag) and then buy from another dealer at a\nlower price. Sometimes this must happen in reality. But\ndoes it happen often? We do, after all, live in an economy\nwhere firms, despite Dr. Miles\u2019 per se rule, still sell com\nplex technical equipment (as well as expensive perfume\nand alligator billfolds) to consumers.\n   All this is to say that the ultimate question is not\nwhether, but how much, \u201cfree riding\u201d of this sort takes\nplace. And, after reading the briefs, I must answer that\nquestion with an uncertain \u201csometimes.\u201d See, e.g., Brief\nfor William S. Comanor and Frederic M. Scherer as Amici\nCuriae 6\u20137 (noting \u201cskepticism in the economic literature\nabout how often [free riding] actually occurs\u201d); Scherer &\nRoss 551\u2013555 (explaining the \u201csevere limitations\u201d of the\nfree-rider justification for resale price maintenance);\nPitofsky, Why Dr. Miles Was Right, 8 Regulation, No. 1,\npp. 27, 29\u201330 (Jan./Feb. 1984) (similar analysis).\n   How easily can courts identify instances in which the\nbenefits are likely to outweigh potential harms? My own\nanswer is, not very easily. For one thing, it is often diffi\ncult to identify who\u2014producer or dealer\u2014is the moving\nforce behind any given resale price maintenance agree\nment. Suppose, for example, several large multibrand\n10     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                      PSKS, INC.                           \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nretailers all sell resale-price-maintained products. Sup\npose further that small producers set retail prices because\nthey fear that, otherwise, the large retailers will favor\n(say, by allocating better shelf-space) the goods of other\nproducers who practice resale price maintenance. Who\n\u201cinitiated\u201d this practice, the retailers hoping for consider\nable insulation from retail competition, or the producers,\nwho simply seek to deal best with the circumstances they\nfind? For another thing, as I just said, it is difficult to\ndetermine just when, and where, the \u201cfree riding\u201d problem\nis serious enough to warrant legal protection.\n   I recognize that scholars have sought to develop check\nlists and sets of questions that will help courts separate\ninstances where anticompetitive harms are more likely\nfrom instances where only benefits are likely to be found.\nSee, e.g., 8 Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b6\u00b61633c\u20131633e, at 330\u2013\n339. See also Brief for William S. Comanor and Frederic\nM. Scherer as Amici Curiae 8\u201310. But applying these\ncriteria in court is often easier said than done. The\nCourt\u2019s invitation to consider the existence of \u201cmarket\npower,\u201d for example, ante, at 18, invites lengthy time-\nconsuming argument among competing experts, as they\nseek to apply abstract, highly technical, criteria to often\nill-defined markets. And resale price maintenance cases,\nunlike a major merger or monopoly case, are likely to\nprove numerous and involve only private parties. One\ncannot fairly expect judges and juries in such cases to\napply complex economic criteria without making a consid\nerable number of mistakes, which themselves may impose\nserious costs. See, e.g., H. Hovenkamp, The Antitrust\nEnterprise 105 (2005) (litigating a rule of reason case is\n\u201cone of the most costly procedures in antitrust practice\u201d).\nSee also Bok, Section 7 of the Clayton Act and the Merg\ning of Law and Economics, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 226, 238\u2013247\n(1960) (describing lengthy FTC efforts to apply complex\ncriteria in a merger case).\n                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)             11\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Are there special advantages to a bright-line rule?\nWithout such a rule, it is often unfair, and consequently\nimpractical, for enforcement officials to bring criminal\nproceedings. And since enforcement resources are limited,\nthat loss may tempt some producers or dealers to enter\ninto agreements that are, on balance, anticompetitive.\n  Given the uncertainties that surround key items in the\noverall balance sheet, particularly in respect to the \u201cad\nministrative\u201d questions, I can concede to the majority that\nthe problem is difficult. And, if forced to decide now, at\nmost I might agree that the per se rule should be slightly\nmodified to allow an exception for the more easily identifi\nable and temporary condition of \u201cnew entry.\u201d See Pitofsky\n1495. But I am not now forced to decide this question.\nThe question before us is not what should be the rule,\nstarting from scratch. We here must decide whether to\nchange a clear and simple price-related antitrust rule that\nthe courts have applied for nearly a century.\n                               II\n   We write, not on a blank slate, but on a slate that begins\nwith Dr. Miles and goes on to list a century\u2019s worth of\nsimilar cases, massive amounts of advice that lawyers\nhave provided their clients, and untold numbers of busi\nness decisions those clients have taken in reliance upon\nthat advice. See, e.g., United States v. Bausch & Lomb\nOptical Co., 321 U. S. 707, 721 (1944); Sylvania, 433 U. S.,\nat 51, n. 18 (\u201cThe per se illegality of [vertical] price restric\ntions has been established firmly for many years . . .\u201d).\nIndeed a Westlaw search shows that Dr. Miles itself has\nbeen cited dozens of times in this Court and hundreds of\ntimes in lower courts. Those who wish this Court to\nchange so well-established a legal precedent bear a heavy\nburden of proof. See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S.\n720, 736 (1977) (noting, in declining to overrule an earlier\ncase interpreting \u00a74 of the Clayton Act, that \u201cconsidera\n12     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                      PSKS, INC.                            \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ntions of stare decisis weigh heavily in the area of statutory\nconstruction, where Congress is free to change this Court\u2019s\ninterpretation of its legislation\u201d). I am not aware of any\ncase in which this Court has overturned so well-\nestablished a statutory precedent. Regardless, I do not see\nhow the Court can claim that ordinary criteria for over\nruling an earlier case have been met. See, e.g., Planned\nParenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833,\n854\u2013855 (1992). See also Federal Election Comm\u2019n v.\nWisconsin Right to Life, Inc., ante, at 19\u201321 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n                               A\n   I can find no change in circumstances in the past several\ndecades that helps the majority\u2019s position. In fact, there\nhas been one important change that argues strongly to the\ncontrary. In 1975, Congress repealed the McGuire and\nMiller-Tydings Acts. See Consumer Goods Pricing Act of\n1975, 89 Stat. 801. And it thereby consciously extended\nDr. Miles\u2019 per se rule. Indeed, at that time the Depart\nment of Justice and the FTC, then urging application of\nthe per se rule, discussed virtually every argument pre\nsented now to this Court as well as others not here pre\nsented. And they explained to Congress why Congress\nshould reject them. See Hearings on S. 408, at 176\u2013177\n(statement of Thomas E. Kauper, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Antitrust Division); id., at 170\u2013172 (testimony of\nLewis A. Engman, Chairman of the FTC); Hearings on\nH. R. 2384, at 113\u2013114 (testimony of Keith I. Clearwaters,\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division).\nCongress fully understood, and consequently intended,\nthat the result of its repeal of McGuire and Miller-Tydings\nwould be to make minimum resale price maintenance per\nse unlawful. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 94\u2013466, pp. 1\u20133 (1975)\n(\u201cWithout [the exemptions authorized by the Miller-\nTydings and McGuire Acts,] the agreements they author\n                  Cite as: 551 U.

But enacting major legislation premised\nupon the existence of that rule constitutes important\npublic reliance upon that rule. And doing so aware of the\nrelevant arguments constitutes even stronger reliance\nupon the Court\u2019s keeping the rule, at least in the absence\nof some significant change in respect to those arguments.\n   Have there been any such changes? There have been a\nfew economic studies, described in some of the briefs, that\nargue, contrary to the testimony of the Justice Depart\nment and FTC to Congress in 1975, that resale price\nmaintenance is not harmful. One study, relying on an\nanalysis of litigated resale price maintenance cases from\n1975 to 1982, concludes that resale price maintenance\ndoes not ordinarily involve producer or dealer collusion.\nSee Ippolito, Resale Price Maintenance: Empirical Evi\ndence from Litigation, 34 J. Law & Econ. 263, 281\u2013282,\n292 (1991). But this study equates the failure of plaintiffs\nto allege collusion with the absence of collusion\u2014an equa\ntion that overlooks the superfluous nature of allegations of\nhorizontal collusion in a resale price maintenance case\nand the tacit form that such collusion might take. See H.\nHovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy \u00a711.3c, p. 464, n. 19\n(3d ed. 2005); supra, at 4\u20135.\n   The other study provides a theoretical basis for conclud\ning that resale price maintenance \u201cneed not lead to higher\nretail prices.\u201d Marvel & McCafferty, The Political Econ\nomy of Resale Price Maintenance, 94 J.

But this study develops a theoretical model\n\u201cunder the assumption that [resale price maintenance] is\nefficiency-enhancing.\u201d Ibid. Its only empirical support is\na 1940 study that the authors acknowledge is much criti\ncized. See id., at 1091. And many other economists take a\ndifferent view. See Brief for William S. Comanor and\nFrederic M. Scherer as Amici Curiae 4.\n   Regardless, taken together, these studies at most may\noffer some mild support for the majority\u2019s position. But\nthey cannot constitute a major change in circumstances.\n   Petitioner and some amici have also presented us with\nnewer studies that show that resale price maintenance\nsometimes brings consumer benefits. Overstreet 119\u2013129\n(describing numerous case studies). But the proponents of\na per se rule have always conceded as much. What is\nremarkable about the majority\u2019s arguments is that noth\ning in this respect is new. See supra, at 3, 12 (citing arti\ncles and congressional testimony going back several dec\nades). The only new feature of these arguments lies in the\nfact that the most current advocates of overruling Dr.\nMiles have abandoned a host of other not-very-persuasive\narguments upon which prior resale price maintenance\nproponents used to rely. See, e.g., 8 Areeda \u00b61631a, at\n350\u2013352 (listing \u201c \u2018[t]raditional\u2019 justifications\u201d for resale\nprice maintenance).\n   The one arguable exception consists of the majority\u2019s\nclaim that \u201ceven absent free riding,\u201d resale price mainte\nnance \u201cmay be the most efficient way to expand the manu\nfacturer\u2019s market share by inducing the retailer\u2019s per\nformance and allowing it to use its own initiative and\nexperience in providing valuable services.\u201d Ante, at 12. I\ncannot count this as an exception, however, because I do\nnot understand how, in the absence of free-riding (and\nassuming competitiveness), an established producer would\nneed resale price maintenance. Why, on these assump\ntions, would a dealer not \u201cexpand\u201d its \u201cmarket share\u201d as\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

There may be an answer\nto this question. But I have not seen it. And I do not\nthink that we should place significant weight upon justifi\ncations that the parties do not explain with sufficient\nclarity for a generalist judge to understand.\n   No one claims that the American economy has changed\nin ways that might support the majority. Concentration in\nretailing has increased. See, e.g., Brief for Respondent 18\n(since minimum resale price maintenance was banned\nnationwide in 1975, the total number of retailers has\ndropped while the growth in sales per store has risen);\nBrief for American Antitrust Institute as Amicus Curiae\n17, n. 20 (citing private study reporting that the combined\nsales of the 10 largest retailers worldwide has grown to\nnearly 30% of total retail sales of top 250 retailers; also\nquoting 1999 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment report stating that the \u201c \u2018last twenty years\nhave seen momentous changes in retail distribution in\ncluding significant increases in concentration\u2019 \u201d); Mamen,\nFacing Goliath: Challenging the Impacts of Supermarket\nConsolidation on our Local Economies, Communities, and\nFood Security, The Oakland Institute, 1 Policy Brief, No.\n3, pp. 1, 2 (Spring 2007), http://www.oaklandinsti\ntute.org/pdfs/facing_goliath.pdf (as visited June 25, 2007,\nand available in Clerks of Court\u2019s case file) (noting that\n\u201c[f]or many decades, the top five food retail firms in the\nU. S. controlled less than 20 percent of the market\u201d; from\n1997 to 2000, \u201cthe top five firms increased their market\nshare from 24 to 42 percent of all retail sales\u201d; and \u201c[b]y\n2003, they controlled over half of all grocery sales\u201d). That\nchange, other things being equal, may enable (and moti\nvate) more retailers, accounting for a greater percentage of\ntotal retail sales volume, to seek resale price maintenance,\nthereby making it more difficult for price-cutting competi\ntors (perhaps internet retailers) to obtain market share.\n16     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                      PSKS, INC.                            \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n  Nor has anyone argued that concentration among manu\nfacturers that might use resale price maintenance has\ndiminished significantly. And as far as I can tell, it has\nnot. Consider household electrical appliances, which a\nstudy from the late 1950\u2019s suggests constituted a signifi\ncant portion of those products subject to resale price main\ntenance at that time. See Hollander, United States of\nAmerica, in Resale Price Maintenance 67, 80\u201381 (B.\nYamey ed. 1966). Although it is somewhat difficult to\ncompare census data from 2002 with that from several\ndecades ago (because of changes in the classification sys\ntem), it is clear that at least some subsets of the household\nelectrical appliance industry are more concentrated, in\nterms of manufacturer market power, now than they were\nthen. For instance, the top eight domestic manufacturers\nof household cooking appliances accounted for 68% of the\ndomestic market (measured by value of shipments) in\n1963 (the earliest date for which I was able to find data),\ncompared with 77% in 2002. See Dept. of Commerce,\nBureau of Census, 1972 Census of Manufacturers, Special\nReport Series, Concentration Ratios in Manufacturing, No.\nMC72(SR)\u20132, p. SR2\u201338 (1975) (hereinafter 1972 Census);\nDept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, 2002 Economic\nCensus, Concentration Ratios: 2002, No. EC02\u201331SR\u20131,\np. 55 (2006) (hereinafter 2002 Census). The top eight\ndomestic manufacturers of household laundry equipment\naccounted for 95% of the domestic market in 1963 (90% in\n1958), compared with 99% in 2002. 1972 Census, at SR2\u2013\n38; 2002 Census, at 55. And the top eight domestic manu\nfacturers of household refrigerators and freezers ac\ncounted for 91% of the domestic market in 1963, compared\nwith 95% in 2002. 1972 Census, at SR2\u201338; 2002 Census,\nat 55. Increased concentration among manufacturers\nincreases the likelihood that producer-originated resale\nprice maintenance will prove more prevalent today than in\nyears past, and more harmful. At the very least, the\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           17\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmajority has not explained how these, or other changes in\nthe economy could help support its position.\n  In sum, there is no relevant change. And without some\nsuch change, there is no ground for abandoning a well-\nestablished antitrust rule.\n                              B\n   With the preceding discussion in mind, I would consult\nthe list of factors that our case law indicates are relevant\nwhen we consider overruling an earlier case. JUSTICE\nSCALIA, writing separately in another of our cases this\nTerm, well summarizes that law. See Wisconsin Right to\nLife, Inc., ante, at 19\u201321. (opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). And every relevant factor he\nmentions argues against overruling Dr. Miles here.\n   First, the Court applies stare decisis more \u201crigidly\u201d in\nstatutory than in constitutional cases. See Glidden Co. v.\nZdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 543 (1962); Illinois Brick Co., 431\nU. S., at 736. This is a statutory case.\n   Second, the Court does sometimes overrule cases that it\ndecided wrongly only a reasonably short time ago. As\nJUSTICE SCALIA put it, \u201c[o]verruling a constitutional case\ndecided just a few years earlier is far from unprece\ndented.\u201d Wisconsin Right to Life, ante, at 19 (emphasis\nadded). We here overrule one statutory case, Dr. Miles,\ndecided 100 years ago, and we overrule the cases that\nreaffirmed its per se rule in the intervening years. See,\ne.g., Trenton Potteries, 273 U. S., at 399\u2013401; Bausch &\nLomb, 321 U. S., at 721; United States v. Parke, Davis &\nCo., 362 U. S. 29, 45\u201347 (1960); Simpson v. Union Oil Co.\nof Cal., 377 U. S. 13, 16\u201317 (1964).\n   Third, the fact that a decision creates an \u201cunworkable\u201d\nlegal regime argues in favor of overruling. See Payne v.\nTennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\u2013828 (1991); Swift & Co. v.\nWickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965). Implementation of\nthe per se rule, even with the complications attendant the\n18     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                      PSKS, INC.                           \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nexception allowed for in United States v. Colgate & Co.,\n250 U. S. 300 (1919), has proved practical over the course\nof the last century, particularly when compared with the\nmany complexities of litigating a case under the \u201crule of\nreason\u201d regime. No one has shown how moving from the\nDr. Miles regime to \u201crule of reason\u201d analysis would make\nthe legal regime governing minimum resale price mainte\nnance more \u201cadministrable,\u201d Wisconsin Right to Life, ante,\nat 20 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), particularly since Colgate\nwould remain good law with respect to unreasonable price\nmaintenance.\n   Fourth, the fact that a decision \u201cunsettles\u201d the law may\nargue in favor of overruling. See Sylvania, 433 U. S., at\n47; Wisconsin Right to Life, ante, at 20\u201321 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.). The per se rule is well-settled law, as the\nCourt itself has previously recognized. Sylvania, supra, at\n51, n. 18. It is the majority\u2019s change here that will unset\ntle the law.\n   Fifth, the fact that a case involves property rights or\ncontract rights, where reliance interests are involved,\nargues against overruling. Payne, supra, at 828. This\ncase involves contract rights and perhaps property rights\n(consider shopping malls). And there has been consider\nable reliance upon the per se rule. As I have said, Con\ngress relied upon the continued vitality of Dr. Miles when\nit repealed Miller-Tydings and McGuire. Supra, at 12\u201313.\nThe Executive Branch argued for repeal on the assump\ntion that Dr. Miles stated the law. Ibid. Moreover, whole\nsectors of the economy have come to rely upon the per se\nrule. A factory outlet store tells us that the rule \u201cform[s]\nan essential part of the regulatory background against\nwhich [that firm] and many other discount retailers have\nfinanced, structured, and operated their businesses.\u201d\nBrief for Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corp. as\nAmicus Curiae 5. The Consumer Federation of America\ntells us that large low-price retailers would not exist with\n                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nout Dr. Miles; minimum resale price maintenance, \u201cby\nstabilizing price levels and preventing low-price competi\ntion, erects a potentially insurmountable barrier to entry\nfor such low-price innovators.\u201d Brief for Consumer Fed\neration of America as Amicus Curiae 5, 7\u20139 (discussing,\ninter alia, comments by Wal-Mart\u2019s founder 25 years ago\nthat relaxation of the per se ban on minimum resale price\nmaintenance would be a \u201c \u2018great danger\u2019 \u201d to Wal-Mart\u2019s\nthen-relatively-nascent business).        See also Brief for\nAmerican Antitrust Institute as Amicus Curiae 14\u201315, and\nsources cited therein (making the same point). New dis\ntributors, including internet distributors, have similarly\ninvested time, money, and labor in an effort to bring yet\nlower cost goods to Americans.\n   This Court\u2019s overruling of the per se rule jeopardizes\nthis reliance, and more. What about malls built on the\nassumption that a discount distributor will remain an\nanchor tenant? What about home buyers who have taken\na home\u2019s distance from such a mall into account? What\nabout Americans, producers, distributors, and consumers,\nwho have understandably assumed, at least for the last 30\nyears, that price competition is a legally guaranteed way\nof life? The majority denies none of this. It simply says\nthat these \u201creliance interests . . . , like the reliance inter\nests in Khan, cannot justify an inefficient rule.\u201d Ante, at\n27.\n   The Court minimizes the importance of this reliance,\nadding that it \u201cis also of note\u201d that at the time resale price\nmaintenance contracts were lawful \u201c \u2018no more than a tiny\nfraction of manufacturers ever employed\u2019 \u201d the practice.\nIbid. (quoting Overstreet 6). By \u201ctiny\u201d the Court means\nmanufacturers that accounted for up to \u201c \u2018ten percent of\nconsumer goods purchases\u2019 \u201d annually. Ibid.. That figure\nin today\u2019s economy equals just over $300 billion. See\nDept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract\nof the United States: 2007, p. 649 (126th ed.) (over $3\n20     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                      PSKS, INC.                            \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ntrillion in U. S. retail sales in 2002). Putting the Court\u2019s\nestimate together with the Justice Department\u2019s early\n1970\u2019s study translates a legal regime that permits all\nresale price maintenance into retail bills that are higher\nby an average of roughly $750 to $1000 annually for an\nAmerican family of four. Just how much higher retail bills\nwill be after the Court\u2019s decision today, of course, depends\nupon what is now unknown, namely how courts will decide\nfuture cases under a \u201crule of reason.\u201d But these figures\nindicate that the amounts involved are important to\nAmerican families and cannot be dismissed as \u201ctiny.\u201d\n   Sixth, the fact that a rule of law has become \u201cembedded\u201d\nin our \u201cnational culture\u201d argues strongly against overrul\ning. Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443\u2013444\n(2000). The per se rule forbidding minimum resale price\nmaintenance agreements has long been \u201cembedded\u201d in the\nlaw of antitrust. It involves price, the economy\u2019s \u201c \u2018central\nnervous system.\u2019 \u201d National Soc. of Professional Engineers,\n435 U. S., at 692 (quoting Socony-Vacuum Oil, 310 U. S.,\nat 226, n. 59). It reflects a basic antitrust assumption\n(that consumers often prefer lower prices to more service).\nIt embodies a basic antitrust objective (providing consum\ners with a free choice about such matters). And it creates\nan easily administered and enforceable bright line, \u201cDo\nnot agree about price,\u201d that businesses as well as lawyers\nhave long understood.\n   The only contrary stare decisis factor that the majority\nmentions consists of its claim that this Court has \u201c[f]rom\nthe beginning . . . treated the Sherman Act as a common-\nlaw statute,\u201d and has previously overruled antitrust prece\ndent. Ante, at 20, 21\u201322. It points in support to State Oil\nCo. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3 (1997), overruling Albrecht v.\nHerald Co., 390 U. S. 145 (1968), in which this Court had\nheld that maximum resale price agreements were unlaw\nful per se, and to Sylvania, overruling United States v.\nArnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U. S. 365 (1967), in which this\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           21\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCourt had held that producer-imposed territorial limits\nwere unlawful per se.\n   The Court decided Khan, however, 29 years after\nAlbrecht\u2014still a significant period, but nowhere close to\nthe century Dr. Miles has stood. The Court specifically\nnoted the lack of any significant reliance upon Albrecht.\n522 U. S., at 18\u201319 (Albrecht has had \u201clittle or no rele\nvance to ongoing enforcement of the Sherman Act\u201d).\nAlbrecht had far less support in traditional antitrust\nprinciples than did Dr. Miles. Compare, e.g., 8 Areeda &\nHovenkamp \u00b61632, at 316\u2013328 (analyzing potential harms\nof minimum resale price maintenance), with id., \u00b61637, at\n352\u2013361 (analyzing potential harms of maximum resale\nprice maintenance). See also, e.g., Pitofsky 1490, n. 17.\nAnd Congress had nowhere expressed support for\nAlbrecht\u2019s rule. Khan, supra, at 19.\n   In Sylvania, the Court, in overruling Schwinn, explicitly\ndistinguished Dr. Miles on the ground that while Congress\nhad \u201crecently . . . expressed its approval of a per se analy\nsis of vertical price restrictions\u201d by repealing the Miller-\nTydings and McGuire Acts, \u201c[n]o similar expression of\ncongressional intent exists for nonprice restrictions.\u201d 433\nU. S., at 51, n. 18. Moreover, the Court decided Sylvania\nonly a decade after Schwinn. And it based its overruling\non a generally perceived need to avoid \u201cconfusion\u201d in the\nlaw, 433 U. S., at 47\u201349, a factor totally absent here.\n   The Court suggests that it is following \u201cthe common-law\ntradition.\u201d Ante at 26. But the common law would not\nhave permitted overruling Dr. Miles in these circum\nstances.     Common-law courts rarely overruled well-\nestablished earlier rules outright. Rather, they would\nover time issue decisions that gradually eroded the scope\nand effect of the rule in question, which might eventually\nlead the courts to put the rule to rest. One can argue that\nmodifying the per se rule to make an exception, say, for\nnew entry, see Pitofsky 1495, could prove consistent with\n22     LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v.\n\n                      PSKS, INC.                          \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nthis approach. To swallow up a century-old precedent,\npotentially affecting many billions of dollars of sales, is\nnot. The reader should compare today\u2019s \u201ccommon-law\u201d\ndecision with Justice Cardozo\u2019s decision in Allegheny\nCollege v. National Chautauqua Cty. Bank of Jamestown,\n246 N. Y. 369, 159 N. E. 173 (1927), and note a gradualism\nthat does not characterize today\u2019s decision.\n  Moreover, a Court that rests its decision upon econo\nmists\u2019 views of the economic merits should also take ac\ncount of legal scholars\u2019 views about common-law overrul\ning. Professors Hart and Sacks list 12 factors (similar to\nthose I have mentioned) that support judicial \u201cadherence\nto prior holdings.\u201d They all support adherence to Dr. Miles\nhere. See H. Hart & A. Sacks, The Legal Process 568\u2013569\n(W. Eskridge & P. Frickey eds. 1994). Karl Llewellyn has\nwritten that the common-law judge\u2019s \u201cconscious reshap\ning\u201d of prior law \u201cmust so move as to hold the degree of\nmovement down to the degree to which need truly\npresses.\u201d The Bramble Bush 156 (1960). Where here is\nthe pressing need? The Court notes that the FTC argues\nhere in favor of a rule of reason. See ante, at 20\u201321. But\nboth Congress and the FTC, unlike courts, are well-\nequipped to gather empirical evidence outside the context\nof a single case. As neither has done so, we cannot con\nclude with confidence that the gains from eliminating the\nper se rule will outweigh the costs.\n  In sum, every stare decisis concern this Court has ever\nmentioned counsels against overruling here. It is difficult\nfor me to understand how one can believe both that (1)\nsatisfying a set of stare decisis concerns justifies over\nruling a recent constitutional decision, Wisconsin Right to\nLife, Inc., ante, at 19\u201321 (SCALIA, J., joined by KENNEDY\nand THOMAS, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment), but (2) failing to satisfy any of those same\nconcerns nonetheless permits overruling a longstanding\nstatutory decision. Either those concerns are relevant or\n                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           23\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthey are not.\n                         *     *     *\n   The only safe predictions to make about today\u2019s decision\nare that it will likely raise the price of goods at retail and\nthat it will create considerable legal turbulence as lower\ncourts seek to develop workable principles. I do not be\nlieve that the majority has shown new or changed condi\ntions sufficient to warrant overruling a decision of such\nlong standing. All ordinary stare decisis considerations\nindicate the contrary. For these reasons, with respect, I\ndissent.\n",

(Leegin), designs, manufactures, and distributes leather goods and accessories. In 1991, Leegin began to sell belts under the brand name \"Brighton.\" The Brighton brand has now expanded into a variety of women's fashion accessories. It is sold across the United States in over 5,000 retail establishments, for the most part independent, small boutiques and specialty stores. Leegin's president, Jerry Kohl, also has an interest in about 70 stores that sell Brighton products. Leegin asserts that, at least for its products, small retailers treat customers better, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2711</span> provide customers more services, and make their shopping experience more satisfactory than do larger, often impersonal retailers. Kohl explained: \"[W]e want the consumers to get a different experience than they get in Sam's Club or in Wal-Mart. And you can't get that kind of experience or support or customer service from a store like Wal-Mart.\" 5 Record 127.</p>\n<p>Respondent, PSKS, Inc. (PSKS), operates Kay's Kloset, a women's apparel store in Lewisville, Texas. Kay's Kloset buys from about 75 different manufacturers and at one time sold the Brighton brand. It first started purchasing Brighton goods from Leegin in 1995. Once it began selling the brand, the store promoted Brighton. For example, it ran Brighton advertisements and had Brighton days in the store. Kay's Kloset became the destination retailer in the area to buy Brighton products. Brighton was the store's most important brand and once accounted for 40 to 50 percent of its profits.</p>\n<p>In 1997, Leegin instituted the \"Brighton Retail Pricing and Promotion Policy.\" 4 <i>id.,</i> at 939. Following the policy, Leegin refused to sell to retailers that discounted Brighton goods below suggested prices. The policy contained an exception for products not selling well that the retailer did not plan on reordering. In the letter to retailers establishing the policy, Leegin stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In this age of mega stores like Macy's, Bloomingdales, May Co. and others, consumers are perplexed by promises of product quality and support of product which we believe is lacking in these large stores. Consumers are further confused by the ever popular sale, sale, sale, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"We, at Leegin, choose to break away from the pack by selling [at] specialty stores; specialty stores that can offer the customer great quality merchandise, superb service, and support the Brighton product 365 days a year on a consistent basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"We realize that half the equation is Leegin producing great Brighton product and the other half is you, our retailer, creating great looking stores selling our products in a quality manner.\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Leegin adopted the policy to give its retailers sufficient margins to provide customers the service central to its distribution strategy. It also expressed concern that discounting harmed Brighton's brand image and reputation.</p>\n<p>A year after instituting the pricing policy Leegin introduced a marketing strategy known as the \"Heart Store Program.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 962-972. It offered retailers incentives to become Heart Stores, and, in exchange, retailers pledged, among other things, to sell at Leegin's suggested prices. Kay's Kloset became a Heart Store soon after Leegin created the program. After a Leegin employee visited the store and found it unattractive, the parties appear to have agreed that Kay's Kloset would not be a Heart Store beyond 1998. Despite losing this status, Kay's Kloset continued to increase its Brighton sales.</p>\n<p>In December 2002, Leegin discovered Kay's Kloset had been marking down Brighton's entire line by 20 percent. Kay's Kloset contended it placed Brighton products on sale to compete with nearby retailers who also were undercutting Leegin's suggested prices. Leegin, nonetheless, requested that Kay's Kloset cease discounting. Its request refused, Leegin stopped selling to the store. The loss of the Brighton brand had a considerable negative impact on the store's revenue from sales.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2712</span> PSKS sued Leegin in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. It alleged, among other claims, that Leegin had violated the antitrust laws by \"enter[ing] into agreements with retailers to charge only those prices fixed by Leegin.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1236. Leegin planned to introduce expert testimony describing the procompetitive effects of its pricing policy. The District Court excluded the testimony, relying on the <i>per se</i> rule established by <i>Dr. Miles.</i> At trial PSKS argued that the Heart Store program, among other things, demonstrated Leegin and its retailers had agreed to fix prices. Leegin responded that it had established a unilateral pricing policy lawful under \u00a7 1, which applies only to concerted action. See <i>United States v.

The jury agreed with PSKS and awarded it $1.2 million. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a), the District Court trebled the damages and reimbursed PSKS for its attorney's fees and costs. It entered judgment against Leegin in the amount of $3,975,000.80.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 171 Fed.Appx. 464 (2006) <i>(per curiam).</i> On appeal Leegin did not dispute that it had entered into vertical price-fixing agreements with its retailers. Rather, it contended that the rule of reason should have applied to those agreements. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument. <i>Id.,</i> at 466-467. It was correct to explain that it remained bound by <i>Dr. Miles</i> \"[b]ecause [the Supreme] Court has consistently applied the <i>per se</i> rule to [vertical minimum price-fixing] agreements.\" 171 Fed.Appx., at 466. On this premise the Court of Appeals held that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony of Leegin's economic expert, for the <i>per se</i> rule rendered irrelevant any procompetitive justifications for Leegin's pricing policy. <i>Id.,</i> at 467. We granted certiorari to determine whether vertical minimum resale price maintenance agreements should continue to be treated as <i>per se</i> unlawful. 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 763, 166 L.Ed.2d 590 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits \"[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States.\" Ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.

See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111115\"><a href=\"/opinion/111115/monsanto-co-v-spray-rite-service-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span>, 761, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984). In <i>Dr. Miles</i> the plaintiff, a manufacturer of medicines, sold its products only to distributors <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2714</span> who agreed to resell them at set prices. The Court found the manufacturer's control of resale prices to be unlawful. It relied on the common-law rule that \"a general restraint upon alienation is ordinarily invalid.\" 220 U.S., at 404-405, 31 S.Ct. 376. The Court then explained that the agreements would advantage the distributors, not the manufacturer, and were analogous to a combination among competing distributors, which the law treated as void. <i>Id.,</i> at 407-408, 31 S.Ct. 376.</p>\n<p>The reasoning of the Court's more recent jurisprudence has rejected the rationales on which <i>Dr. Miles</i> was based. By relying on the common-law rule against restraints on alienation, <i>id.,</i> at 404-405, 31 S.Ct. 376, the Court justified its decision based on \"formalistic\" legal doctrine rather than \"demonstrable economic effect,\" <i>GTE Sylvania, supra,</i> at 58-59, 97 S.Ct. 2549. The Court in <i>Dr. Miles</i> relied on a treatise published in 1628, but failed to discuss in detail the business reasons that would motivate a manufacturer situated in 1911 to make use of vertical price restraints. Yet the Sherman Act's use of \"restraint of trade\" \"invokes the common law itself, ... not merely the static content that the common law had assigned to the term in 1890.\" <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 732, 108 S.Ct. 1515. The general restraint on alienation, especially in the age when then-Justice Hughes used the term, tended to evoke policy concerns extraneous to the question that controls here. Usually associated with land, not chattels, the rule arose from restrictions removing real property from the stream of commerce for generations. The Court should be cautious about putting dispositive weight on doctrines from antiquity but of slight relevance. We reaffirm that \"the state of the common law 400 or even 100 years ago is irrelevant to the issue before us: the effect of the antitrust laws upon vertical distributional restraints in the American economy today.\" <i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 53, n. 21, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p><i>Dr. Miles,</i> furthermore, treated vertical agreements a manufacturer makes with its distributors as analogous to a horizontal combination among competing distributors. See 220 U.S., at 407-408, 31 S.Ct. 376. In later cases, however, the Court rejected the approach of reliance on rules governing horizontal restraints when defining rules applicable to vertical ones. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 734, 108 S.Ct. 1515 (disclaiming the \"notion of equivalence between the scope of horizontal <i>per se</i> illegality and that of vertical <i>per se</i> illegality\"); <i>Maricopa County, supra,</i> at 348, n. 18, 102 S.Ct. 2466 (noting that \"horizontal restraints are generally less defensible than vertical restraints\"). Our recent cases formulate antitrust principles in accordance with the appreciated differences in economic effect between vertical and horizontal agreements, differences the <i>Dr. Miles</i> Court failed to consider.</p>\n<p>The reasons upon which <i>Dr. Miles</i> relied do not justify a <i>per se</i> rule. As a consequence, it is necessary to examine, in the first instance, the economic effects of vertical agreements to fix minimum resale prices, and to determine whether the <i>per se</i> rule is nonetheless appropriate. See <i>Business Electronics,</i> 485 U.S., at 726, 108 S.Ct. 1515.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Though each side of the debate can find sources to support its position, it suffices to say here that economics literature is replete with procompetitive justifications for a manufacturer's use of resale price maintenance. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Economists as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 16 (\"In the theoretical literature, it is essentially undisputed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2715</span> that minimum [resale price maintenance] can have procompetitive effects and that under a variety of market conditions it is unlikely to have anticompetitive effects\"); Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 9 (\"[T]here is a widespread consensus that permitting a manufacturer to control the price at which its goods are sold may promote <i>inter</i>brand competition and consumer welfare in a variety of ways\"); ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law and Economics of Product Distribution 76 (2006) (\"[T]he bulk of the economic literature on [resale price maintenance] suggests that [it] is more likely to be used to enhance efficiency than for anticompetitive purposes\"); see also H. Hovenkamp, The Antitrust Enterprise: Principle and Execution 184-191 (2005) (hereinafter Hovenkamp); R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 288-291 (1978) (hereinafter Bork). Even those more skeptical of resale price maintenance acknowledge it can have procompetitive effects. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for William S. Comanor et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 3 (\"[G]iven [the] diversity of effects [of resale price maintenance], one could reasonably take the position that a <i>rule of reason</i> rather than a <i>per se</i> approach is warranted\"); F.M. Scherer &amp; D. Ross, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 558 (3d ed.1990) (hereinafter Scherer &amp; Ross) (\"The overall balance between benefits and costs [of resale price maintenance] is probably close\").</p>\n<p>The few recent studies documenting the competitive effects of resale price maintenance also cast doubt on the conclusion that the practice meets the criteria for a <i>per se</i> rule. See T. Overstreet, Resale Price Maintenance: Economic Theories and Empirical Evidence 170 (1983) (hereinafter Overstreet) (noting that \"[e]fficient uses of [resale price maintenance] are evidently not unusual or rare\"); see also Ippolito, Resale Price Maintenance: Empirical Evidence From Litigation, 34 J. Law &amp; Econ. 263, 292-293 (1991) (hereinafter Ippolito).</p>\n<p>The justifications for vertical price restraints are similar to those for other vertical restraints. See <i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 54-57, 97 S.Ct. 2549. Minimum resale price maintenance can stimulate interbrand competition\u0097the competition among manufacturers selling different brands of the same type of product\u0097by reducing intrabrand competition\u0097the competition among retailers selling the same brand. See <i>id.,</i> at 51-52, 97 S.Ct. 2549. The promotion of interbrand competition is important because \"the primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect [this type of] competition.\" <i>Khan,</i> 522 U.S., at 15, 118 S.Ct. 275. A single manufacturer's use of vertical price restraints tends to eliminate intrabrand price competition; this in turn encourages retailers to invest in tangible or intangible services or promotional efforts that aid the manufacturer's position as against rival manufacturers. Resale price maintenance also has the potential to give consumers more options so that they can choose among low-price, low-service brands; high-price, high-service brands; and brands that fall in between.</p>\n<p>Absent vertical price restraints, the retail services that enhance interbrand competition might be underprovided. This is because discounting retailers can free ride on retailers who furnish services and then capture some of the increased demand those services generate. <i>GTE Sylvania, supra,</i> at 55, 97 S.Ct. 2549. Consumers might learn, for example, about the benefits of a manufacturer's product from a retailer that invests in fine showrooms, offers product demonstrations, or hires and trains knowledgeable employees. R. Posner, Antitrust Law 172-173 (2d ed.2001) (hereinafter Posner). Or consumers might decide to buy the product because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2716</span> they see it in a retail establishment that has a reputation for selling high-quality merchandise. Marvel &amp; McCafferty, Resale Price Maintenance and Quality Certification, 15 Rand J. Econ. 346, 347-349 (1984) (hereinafter Marvel &amp; McCafferty). If the consumer can then buy the product from a retailer that discounts because it has not spent capital providing services or developing a quality reputation, the high-service retailer will lose sales to the discounter, forcing it to cut back its services to a level lower than consumers would otherwise prefer. Minimum resale price maintenance alleviates the problem because it prevents the discounter from undercutting the service provider. With price competition decreased, the manufacturer's retailers compete among themselves over services.</p>\n<p>Resale price maintenance, in addition, can increase interbrand competition by facilitating market entry for new firms and brands. \"[N]ew manufacturers and manufacturers entering new markets can use the restrictions in order to induce competent and aggressive retailers to make the kind of investment of capital and labor that is often required in the distribution of products unknown to the consumer.\" <i>GTE Sylvania, supra,</i> at 55, 97 S.Ct. 2549; see Marvel &amp; McCafferty 349 (noting that reliance on a retailer's reputation \"will decline as the manufacturer's brand becomes better known, so that [resale price maintenance] may be particularly important as a competitive device for new entrants\"). New products and new brands are essential to a dynamic economy, and if markets can be penetrated by using resale price maintenance there is a procompetitive effect.</p>\n<p>Resale price maintenance can also increase interbrand competition by encouraging retailer services that would not be provided even absent free riding. It may be difficult and inefficient for a manufacturer to make and enforce a contract with a retailer specifying the different services the retailer must perform. Offering the retailer a guaranteed margin and threatening termination if it does not live up to expectations may be the most efficient way to expand the manufacturer's market share by inducing the retailer's performance and allowing it to use its own initiative and experience in providing valuable services. See Mathewson &amp; Winter, The Law and Economics of Resale Price Maintenance, 13 Rev. Indus. Org. 57, 74-75 (1998) (hereinafter Mathewson &amp; Winter); Klein &amp; Murphy, Vertical Restraints as Contract Enforcement Mechanisms, 31 J. Law &amp; Econ. 265, 295 (1988); see also Deneckere, Marvel, &amp; Peck, Demand Uncertainty, Inventories, and Resale Price Maintenance, 111 Q.J. Econ. 885, 911 (1996) (noting that resale price maintenance may be beneficial to motivate retailers to stock adequate inventories of a manufacturer's goods in the face of uncertain consumer demand).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>While vertical agreements setting minimum resale prices can have procompetitive justifications, they may have anticompetitive effects in other cases; and unlawful price fixing, designed solely to obtain monopoly profits, is an ever present temptation. Resale price maintenance may, for example, facilitate a manufacturer cartel. See <i>Business Electronics,</i> 485 U.S., at 725, 108 S.Ct. 1515. An unlawful cartel will seek to discover if some manufacturers are undercutting the cartel's fixed prices. Resale price maintenance could assist the cartel in identifying price-cutting manufacturers who benefit from the lower prices they offer. Resale price maintenance, furthermore, could discourage a manufacturer from cutting prices to retailers with the concomitant benefit of cheaper prices to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2717</span> consumers. See <i>ibid.;</i> see also Posner 172; Overstreet 19-23.</p>\n<p>Vertical price restraints also \"might be used to organize cartels at the retailer level.\" <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 725-726, 108 S.Ct. 1515. A group of retailers might collude to fix prices to consumers and then compel a manufacturer to aid the unlawful arrangement with resale price maintenance. In that instance the manufacturer does not establish the practice to stimulate services or to promote its brand but to give inefficient retailers higher profits. Retailers with better distribution systems and lower cost structures would be prevented from charging lower prices by the agreement. See Posner 172; Overstreet 13-19. Historical examples suggest this possibility is a legitimate concern. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Marvel &amp; McCafferty, The Welfare Effects of Resale Price Maintenance, 28 J. Law &amp; Econ. 363, 373 (1985) (hereinafter Marvel) (providing an example of the power of the National Association of Retail Druggists to compel manufacturers to use resale price maintenance); Hovenkamp 186 (suggesting that the retail druggists in <i>Dr. Miles</i> formed a cartel and used manufacturers to enforce it).</p>\n<p>A horizontal cartel among competing manufacturers or competing retailers that decreases output or reduces competition in order to increase price is, and ought to be, <i>per se</i> unlawful. See <i>Texaco,</i> 547 U.S., at 5, 126 S.Ct. 1276; <i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 58, n. 28, 97 S.Ct. 2549. To the extent a vertical agreement setting minimum resale prices is entered upon to facilitate either type of cartel, it, too, would need to be held unlawful under the rule of reason. This type of agreement may also be useful evidence for a plaintiff attempting to prove the existence of a horizontal cartel.</p>\n<p>Resale price maintenance, furthermore, can be abused by a powerful manufacturer or retailer. A dominant retailer, for example, might request resale price maintenance to forestall innovation in distribution that decreases costs. A manufacturer might consider it has little choice but to accommodate the retailer's demands for vertical price restraints if the manufacturer believes it needs access to the retailer's distribution network. See Overstreet 31; 8 P. Areeda &amp; H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law 47 (2d ed.2004) (hereinafter Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp); cf. <i>Toys \"R\" Us, Inc. v. FTC,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></span>, 937-938 (C.A.7 2000). A manufacturer with market power, by comparison, might use resale price maintenance to give retailers an incentive not to sell the products of smaller rivals or new entrants. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Marvel 366-368. As should be evident, the potential anticompetitive consequences of vertical price restraints must not be ignored or underestimated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Notwithstanding the risks of unlawful conduct, it cannot be stated with any degree of confidence that resale price maintenance \"always or almost always tend[s] to restrict competition and decrease output.\" <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 723, 108 S.Ct. 1515 (internal quotation marks omitted). Vertical agreements establishing minimum resale prices can have either procompetitive or anticompetitive effects, depending upon the circumstances in which they are formed. And although the empirical evidence on the topic is limited, it does not suggest efficient uses of the agreements are infrequent or hypothetical. See Overstreet 170; see also <i>id.,</i> at 80 (noting that for the majority of enforcement actions brought by the Federal Trade Commission between 1965 and 1982, \"the use of [resale price maintenance] was not likely motivated by collusive dealers who had successfully coerced their suppliers\"); Ippolito 292 (reaching a similar conclusion). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2718</span> As the rule would proscribe a significant amount of procompetitive conduct, these agreements appear ill suited for <i>per se</i> condemnation.</p>\n<p>Respondent contends, nonetheless, that vertical price restraints should be <i>per se</i> unlawful because of the administrative convenience of <i>per se</i> rules. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>GTE Sylvania, supra,</i> at 50, n. 16, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (noting \"<i>per se</i> rules tend to provide guidance to the business community and to minimize the burdens on litigants and the judicial system\"). That argument suggests <i>per se</i> illegality is the rule rather than the exception. This misinterprets our antitrust law. <i>Per se</i> rules may decrease administrative costs, but that is only part of the equation. Those rules can be counterproductive. They can increase the total cost of the antitrust system by prohibiting procompetitive conduct the antitrust laws should encourage. See Easterbrook, Vertical Arrangements and the Rule of Reason, 53 Antitrust L.J. 135, 158 (1984) (hereinafter Easterbrook). They also may increase litigation costs by promoting frivolous suits against legitimate practices. The Court has thus explained that administrative \"advantages are not sufficient in themselves to justify the creation of <i>per se</i> rules,\" <i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 50, n. 16, 97 S.Ct. 2549, and has relegated their use to restraints that are \"manifestly anticompetitive,\" <i>id.,</i> at 49-50, 97 S.Ct. 2549. Were the Court now to conclude that vertical price restraints should be <i>per se</i> illegal based on administrative costs, we would undermine, if not overrule, the traditional \"demanding standards\" for adopting <i>per se</i> rules. <i>Id.,</i> at 50, 97 S.Ct. 2549. Any possible reduction in administrative costs cannot alone justify the <i>Dr. Miles</i> rule.</p>\n<p>Respondent also argues the <i>per se</i> rule is justified because a vertical price restraint can lead to higher prices for the manufacturer's goods. See also Overstreet 160 (noting that \"price surveys indicate that [resale price maintenance] in most cases increased the prices of products sold\"). Respondent is mistaken in relying on pricing effects absent a further showing of anticompetitive conduct. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 106 (explaining that price surveys \"do not necessarily tell us anything conclusive about the welfare effects of [resale price maintenance] because the results are generally consistent with both procompetitive and anticompetitive theories\"). For, as has been indicated already, the antitrust laws are designed primarily to protect interbrand competition, from which lower prices can later result. See <i>Khan,</i> 522 U.S., at 15, 118 S.Ct. 275. The Court, moreover, has evaluated other vertical restraints under the rule of reason even though prices can be increased in the course of promoting procompetitive effects. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Business Electronics,</i> 485 U.S., at 728, 108 S.Ct. 1515. And resale price maintenance may reduce prices if manufacturers have resorted to costlier alternatives of controlling resale prices that are not <i>per se</i> unlawful. See <i>infra,</i> at 2721-2724; see also Marvel 371.</p>\n<p>Respondent's argument, furthermore, overlooks that, in general, the interests of manufacturers and consumers are aligned with respect to retailer profit margins. The difference between the price a manufacturer charges retailers and the price retailers charge consumers represents part of the manufacturer's cost of distribution, which, like any other cost, the manufacturer usually desires to minimize. See <i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 56, n. 24, 97 S.Ct. 2549; see also <i>id.,</i> at 56, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (\"Economists ... have argued that manufacturers have an economic interest in maintaining as much intrabrand competition as is consistent with the efficient distribution of their products\"). A manufacturer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2719</span> has no incentive to overcompensate retailers with unjustified margins. The retailers, not the manufacturer, gain from higher retail prices. The manufacturer often loses; interbrand competition reduces its competitiveness and market share because consumers will \"substitute a different brand of the same product.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 52, n. 19, 97 S.Ct. 2549; see <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 725, 108 S.Ct. 1515. As a general matter, therefore, a single manufacturer will desire to set minimum resale prices only if the \"increase in demand resulting from enhanced service ... will more than offset a negative impact on demand of a higher retail price.\" Mathewson &amp; Winter 67.</p>\n<p>The implications of respondent's position are far reaching. Many decisions a manufacturer makes and carries out through concerted action can lead to higher prices. A manufacturer might, for example, contract with different suppliers to obtain better inputs that improve product quality. Or it might hire an advertising agency to promote awareness of its goods. Yet no one would think these actions violate the Sherman Act because they lead to higher prices. The antitrust laws do not require manufacturers to produce generic goods that consumers do not know about or want. The manufacturer strives to improve its product quality or to promote its brand because it believes this conduct will lead to increased demand despite higher prices. The same can hold true for resale price maintenance.</p>\n<p>Resale price maintenance, it is true, does have economic dangers. If the rule of reason were to apply to vertical price restraints, courts would have to be diligent in eliminating their anticompetitive uses from the market. This is a realistic objective, and certain factors are relevant to the inquiry. For example, the number of manufacturers that make use of the practice in a given industry can provide important instruction. When only a few manufacturers lacking market power adopt the practice, there is little likelihood it is facilitating a manufacturer cartel, for a cartel then can be undercut by rival manufacturers. See Overstreet 22; Bork 294. Likewise, a retailer cartel is unlikely when only a single manufacturer in a competitive market uses resale price maintenance. Interbrand competition would divert consumers to lower priced substitutes and eliminate any gains to retailers from their price-fixing agreement over a single brand. See Posner 172; Bork 292. Resale price maintenance should be subject to more careful scrutiny, by contrast, if many competing manufacturers adopt the practice. Cf. Scherer &amp; Ross 558 (noting that \"except when [resale price maintenance] spreads to cover the bulk of an industry's output, depriving consumers of a meaningful choice between high-service and low-price outlets, most [resale price maintenance arrangements] are probably innocuous\"); Easterbrook 162 (suggesting that \"every one of the potentially-anticompetitive outcomes of vertical arrangements depends on the uniformity of the practice\").</p>\n<p>The source of the restraint may also be an important consideration. If there is evidence retailers were the impetus for a vertical price restraint, there is a greater likelihood that the restraint facilitates a retailer cartel or supports a dominant, inefficient retailer. See Brief for William S. Comanor et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7-8. If, by contrast, a manufacturer adopted the policy independent of retailer pressure, the restraint is less likely to promote anticompetitive conduct. Cf. Posner 177 (\"It makes all the difference whether minimum retail prices are imposed by the manufacturer in order to evoke point-of-sale services or by the dealers in order to obtain monopoly profits\"). A manufacturer also has an incentive to protest inefficient retailer-induced <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2720</span> price restraints because they can harm its competitive position.</p>\n<p>As a final matter, that a dominant manufacturer or retailer can abuse resale price maintenance for anticompetitive purposes may not be a serious concern unless the relevant entity has market power. If a retailer lacks market power, manufacturers likely can sell their goods through rival retailers. See also <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 727, n. 2, 108 S.Ct. 1515 (noting \"[r]etail market power is rare, because of the usual presence of interbrand competition and other dealers\"). And if a manufacturer lacks market power, there is less likelihood it can use the practice to keep competitors away from distribution outlets.</p>\n<p>The rule of reason is designed and used to eliminate anticompetitive transactions from the market. This standard principle applies to vertical price restraints. A party alleging injury from a vertical agreement setting minimum resale prices will have, as a general matter, the information and resources available to show the existence of the agreement and its scope of operation. As courts gain experience considering the effects of these restraints by applying the rule of reason over the course of decisions, they can establish the litigation structure to ensure the rule operates to eliminate anticompetitive restraints from the market and to provide more guidance to businesses. Courts can, for example, devise rules over time for offering proof, or even presumptions where justified, to make the rule of reason a fair and efficient way to prohibit anticompetitive restraints and to promote procompetitive ones.</p>\n<p>For all of the foregoing reasons, we think that were the Court considering the issue as an original matter, the rule of reason, not a <i>per se</i> rule of unlawfulness, would be the appropriate standard to judge vertical price restraints.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>We do not write on a clean slate, for the decision in <i>Dr. Miles</i> is almost a century old. So there is an argument for its retention on the basis of <i>stare decisis</i> alone. Even if <i>Dr. Miles</i> established an erroneous rule, \"<i>[s]tare decisis</i> reflects a policy judgment that in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.\" <i>Khan,</i> 522 U.S., at 20, 118 S.Ct. 275 (internal quotation marks omitted). And concerns about maintaining settled law are strong when the question is one of statutory interpretation. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Hohn v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118230\"><a href=\"/opinion/118230/hohn-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 251, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998).</p>\n<p><i>Stare decisis</i> is not as significant in this case, however, because the issue before us is the scope of the Sherman Act. <i>Khan, supra,</i> at 20, 118 S.Ct. 275 (\"[T]he general presumption that legislative changes should be left to Congress has less force with respect to the Sherman Act\"). From the beginning the Court has treated the Sherman Act as a common-law statute. See <i>National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109833\"><a href=\"/opinion/109833/national-soc-of-professional-engineers-v-united-st/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">679</span></a></span>, 688, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978); see also <i>Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110460\"><a href=\"/opinion/110460/northwest-airlines-inc-v-transport-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 98, n. 42, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981) (\"In antitrust, the federal courts ... act more as common-law courts than in other areas governed by federal statute\"). Just as the common law adapts to modern understanding and greater experience, so too does the Sherman Act's prohibition on \"restraint[s] of trade\" evolve to meet the dynamics of present economic conditions. The case-by-case adjudication contemplated by the rule of reason has implemented this common-law approach. See <i>National Soc. of Professional Engineers, supra,</i> at 688, 98 S.Ct. 1355. Likewise, the boundaries of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2721</span> the doctrine of <i>per se</i> illegality should not be immovable. For \"[i]t would make no sense to create out of the single term `restraint of trade' a chronologically schizoid statute, in which a `rule of reason' evolves with new circumstance and new wisdom, but a line of <i>per se</i> illegality remains forever fixed where it was.\" <i>Business Electronics,</i> 485 U.S., at 732, 108 S.Ct. 1515.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p><i>Stare decisis,</i> we conclude, does not compel our continued adherence to the <i>per se</i> rule against vertical price restraints. As discussed earlier, respected authorities in the economics literature suggest the <i>per se</i> rule is inappropriate, and there is now widespread agreement that resale price maintenance can have procompetitive effects. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Economists as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 16. It is also significant that both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission\u0097the antitrust enforcement agencies with the ability to assess the long-term impacts of resale price maintenance\u0097have recommended that this Court replace the <i>per se</i> rule with the traditional rule of reason. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 6. In the antitrust context the fact that a decision has been \"called into serious question\" justifies our reevaluation of it. <i>Khan, supra,</i> at 21, 118 S.Ct. 275.</p>\n<p>Other considerations reinforce the conclusion that <i>Dr. Miles</i> should be overturned. Of most relevance, \"we have overruled our precedents when subsequent cases have undermined their doctrinal underpinnings.\" <i>Dickerson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118380\"><a href=\"/opinion/118380/dickerson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span>, 443, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000). The Court's treatment of vertical restraints has progressed away from <i>Dr. Miles</i>' strict approach. We have distanced ourselves from the opinion's rationales. See <i>supra,</i> at 2713-2714; see also <i>Khan, supra,</i> at 21, 118 S.Ct. 275 (overruling a case when \"the views underlying [it had been] eroded by this Court's precedent\"); <i>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112261\"><a href=\"/opinion/112261/rodriguez-de-quijas-v-shearsonamerican-express-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span>, 480-481, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989) (same). This is unsurprising, for the case was decided not long after enactment of the Sherman Act when the Court had little experience with antitrust analysis. Only eight years after <i>Dr. Miles,</i> moreover, the Court reined in the decision by holding that a manufacturer can announce suggested resale prices and refuse to deal with distributors who do not follow them. <i>Colgate,</i> 250 U.S., at 307-308, 39 S.Ct. 465.</p>\n<p>In more recent cases the Court, following a common-law approach, has continued to temper, limit, or overrule once strict prohibitions on vertical restraints. In 1977, the Court overturned the <i>per se</i> rule for vertical nonprice restraints, adopting the rule of reason in its stead. <i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 57-59, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (overruling <i>United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107491\"><a href=\"/opinion/107491/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 87 S.Ct. 1856, 18 L.Ed.2d 1249 (1967)); see also 433 U.S., at 58, n. 29, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (noting \"that the advantages of vertical restrictions should not be limited to the categories of new entrants and failing firms\"). While the Court in a footnote in <i>GTE Sylvania</i> suggested that differences between vertical price and nonprice restraints could support different legal treatment, see 433 U.S., at 51, n. 18, 97 S.Ct. 2549, the central part of the opinion relied on authorities and arguments that find unequal treatment \"difficult to justify,\" <i>id.,</i> at 69-70, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (White, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>Continuing in this direction, in two cases in the 1980's the Court defined legal rules to limit the reach of <i>Dr. Miles</i> and to accommodate the doctrines enunciated in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2722</span> <i>GTE Sylvania</i> and <i>Colgate.</i> See <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 726-728, 108 S.Ct. 1515; <i>Monsanto,</i> 465 U.S., at 763-764, 104 S.Ct. 1464. In <i>Monsanto,</i> the Court required that antitrust plaintiffs alleging a \u00a7 1 price-fixing conspiracy must present evidence tending to exclude the possibility a manufacturer and its distributors acted in an independent manner. <i>Id.,</i> at 764, 104 S.Ct. 1464. Unlike Justice Brennan's concurrence, which rejected arguments that <i>Dr. Miles</i> should be overruled, see 465 U.S., at 769, 104 S.Ct. 1464, the Court \"decline[d] to reach the question\" whether vertical agreements fixing resale prices always should be unlawful because neither party suggested otherwise, <i>id.,</i> at 761-762, n. 7, 104 S.Ct. 1464. In <i>Business Electronics</i> the Court further narrowed the scope of <i>Dr. Miles.</i> It held that the <i>per se</i> rule applied only to specific agreements over price levels and not to an agreement between a manufacturer and a distributor to terminate a price-cutting distributor. 485 U.S., at 726-727, 735-736, 108 S.Ct. 1515.</p>\n<p>Most recently, in 1997, after examining the issue of vertical maximum price-fixing agreements in light of commentary and real experience, the Court overruled a 29-year-old precedent treating those agreements as <i>per se</i> illegal. <i>Khan,</i> 522 U.S., at 22, 118 S.Ct. 275 (overruling <i>Albrecht v. Herald Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107615\"><a href=\"/opinion/107615/albrecht-v-herald-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 88 S.Ct. 869, 19 L.Ed.2d 998 (1968)). It held instead that they should be evaluated under the traditional rule of reason. 522 U.S., at 22, 118 S.Ct. 275. Our continued limiting of the reach of the decision in <i>Dr. Miles</i> and our recent treatment of other vertical restraints justify the conclusion that <i>Dr. Miles</i> should not be retained.</p>\n<p>The <i>Dr. Miles</i> rule is also inconsistent with a principled framework, for it makes little economic sense when analyzed with our other cases on vertical restraints. If we were to decide the procompetitive effects of resale price maintenance were insufficient to overrule <i>Dr. Miles,</i> then cases such as <i>Colgate</i> and <i>GTE Sylvania</i> themselves would be called into question. These later decisions, while they may result in less intrabrand competition, can be justified because they permit manufacturers to secure the procompetitive benefits associated with vertical price restraints through other methods. The other methods, however, could be less efficient for a particular manufacturer to establish and sustain. The end result hinders competition and consumer welfare because manufacturers are forced to engage in second-best alternatives and because consumers are required to shoulder the increased expense of the inferior practices.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer has a number of legitimate options to achieve benefits similar to those provided by vertical price restraints. A manufacturer can exercise its <i>Colgate</i> right to refuse to deal with retailers that do not follow its suggested prices. See 250 U.S., at 307, 39 S.Ct. 465. The economic effects of unilateral and concerted price setting are in general the same. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Monsanto,</i> 465 U.S., at 762-764, 104 S.Ct. 1464. The problem for the manufacturer is that a jury might conclude its unilateral policy was really a vertical agreement, subjecting it to treble damages and potential criminal liability. <i>Ibid.; </i><i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 728, 108 S.Ct. 1515. Even with the stringent standards in <i>Monsanto</i> and <i>Business Electronics,</i> this danger can lead, and has led, rational manufacturers to take wasteful measures. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for PING, Inc., as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 9-18. A manufacturer might refuse to discuss its pricing policy with its distributors except through counsel knowledgeable of the subtle intricacies of the law. Or it might terminate longstanding distributors for minor violations without seeking an explanation. See <i>ibid.</i> The increased costs these burdensome <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2723</span> measures generate flow to consumers in the form of higher prices.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, depending on the type of product it sells, a manufacturer might be able to achieve the procompetitive benefits of resale price maintenance by integrating downstream and selling its products directly to consumers. <i>Dr. Miles</i> tilts the relative costs of vertical integration and vertical agreement by making the former more attractive based on the <i>per se</i> rule, not on real market conditions. See <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 725, 108 S.Ct. 1515; see generally Coase, The Nature of the Firm, 4 Economica, New Series 386 (1937). This distortion might lead to inefficient integration that would not otherwise take place, so that consumers must again suffer the consequences of the suboptimal distribution strategy. And integration, unlike vertical price restraints, eliminates all intrabrand competition. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>GTE Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 57, n. 26, 97 S.Ct. 2549.</p>\n<p>There is yet another consideration. A manufacturer can impose territorial restrictions on distributors and allow only one distributor to sell its goods in a given region. Our cases have recognized, and the economics literature confirms, that these vertical nonprice restraints have impacts similar to those of vertical price restraints; both reduce intrabrand competition and can stimulate retailer services. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 728, 108 S.Ct. 1515; <i>Monsanto, supra,</i> at 762-763, 104 S.Ct. 1464; see also Brief for Economists as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 17-18. Cf. Scherer &amp; Ross 560 (noting that vertical nonprice restraints \"can engender inefficiencies at least as serious as those imposed upon the consumer by resale price maintenance\"); Steiner, How Manufacturers Deal with the Price-Cutting Retailer: When Are Vertical Restraints Efficient?, 65 Antitrust L.J. 407, 446-447 (1997) (indicating that \"antitrust law should recognize that the consumer interest is often better served by [resale price maintenance]\u0097contrary to its per se illegality and the rule-of-reason status of vertical nonprice restraints\"). The same legal standard (<i>per se</i> unlawfulness) applies to horizontal market division and horizontal price fixing because both have similar economic effect. There is likewise little economic justification for the current differential treatment of vertical price and nonprice restraints. Furthermore, vertical nonprice restraints may prove less efficient for inducing desired services, and they reduce intrabrand competition more than vertical price restraints by eliminating both price and service competition. See Brief for Economists as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 17-18.</p>\n<p>In sum, it is a flawed antitrust doctrine that serves the interests of lawyers\u0097by creating legal distinctions that operate as traps for the unwary\u0097more than the interests of consumers\u0097by requiring manufacturers to choose second-best options to achieve sound business objectives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondent's arguments for reaffirming <i>Dr. Miles</i> on the basis of <i>stare decisis</i> do not require a different result. Respondent looks to congressional action concerning vertical price restraints. In 1937, Congress passed the Miller-Tydings Fair Trade Act, 50 Stat. 693, which made vertical price restraints legal if authorized by a fair trade law enacted by a State. Fifteen years later, Congress expanded the exemption to permit vertical price-setting agreements between a manufacturer and a distributor to be enforced against other distributors not involved in the agreement. McGuire Act, 66 Stat. 632. In 1975, however, Congress repealed both Acts. Consumer Goods Pricing Act, 89 Stat. 801. That the <i>Dr. Miles</i> rule applied to vertical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2724</span> price restraints in 1975, according to respondent, shows Congress ratified the rule.</p>\n<p>This is not so. The text of the Consumer Goods Pricing Act did not codify the rule of <i>per se</i> illegality for vertical price restraints. It rescinded statutory provisions that made them <i>per se</i> legal. Congress once again placed these restraints within the ambit of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act. And, as has been discussed, Congress intended \u00a7 1 to give courts the ability \"to develop governing principles of law\" in the common-law tradition. <i>Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110484\"><a href=\"/opinion/110484/texas-industries-inc-v-radcliff-materials-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span>, 643, 101 S.Ct. 2061, 68 L.Ed.2d 500 (1981); see <i>Business Electronics,</i> 485 U.S., at 731, 108 S.Ct. 1515 (\"The changing content of the term `restraint of trade' was well recognized at the time the Sherman Act was enacted\"). Congress could have set the <i>Dr. Miles</i> rule in stone, but it chose a more flexible option. We respect its decision by analyzing vertical price restraints, like all restraints, in conformance with traditional \u00a7 1 principles, including the principle that our antitrust doctrines \"evolv[e] with new circumstances and new wisdom.\" <i>Business Electronics, supra,</i> at 732, 108 S.Ct. 1515; see also Easterbrook 139.</p>\n<p>The rule of reason, furthermore, is not inconsistent with the Consumer Goods Pricing Act. Unlike the earlier congressional exemption, it does not treat vertical price restraints as <i>per se</i> legal. In this respect, the justifications for the prior exemption are illuminating. Its goal \"was to allow the States to protect small retail establishments that Congress thought might otherwise be driven from the marketplace by large-volume discounters.\" <i>California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110215\"><a href=\"/opinion/110215/california-retail-liquor-dealers-assn-v-midcal-alu/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 102, 100 S.Ct. 937, 63 L.Ed.2d 233 (1980). The state fair trade laws also appear to have been justified on similar grounds. See Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp 298. The rationales for these provisions are foreign to the Sherman Act. Divorced from competition and consumer welfare, they were designed to save inefficient small retailers from their inability to compete. The purpose of the antitrust laws, by contrast, is \"the protection of <i>competition,</i> not <i>competitors.</i>\" <i>Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112425\"><a href=\"/opinion/112425/atlantic-richfield-co-v-usa-petroleum-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span>, 338, 110 S.Ct. 1884, 109 L.Ed.2d 333 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). To the extent Congress repealed the exemption for some vertical price restraints to end its prior practice of encouraging anticompetitive conduct, the rule of reason promotes the same objective.</p>\n<p>Respondent also relies on several congressional appropriations in the mid-1980's in which Congress did not permit the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission to use funds to advocate overturning <i>Dr. Miles.</i> See, <i>e.g.,</i> 97 Stat. 1071. We need not pause long in addressing this argument. The conditions on funding are no longer in place, see, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 21, and they were ambiguous at best. As much as they might show congressional approval for <i>Dr. Miles,</i> they might demonstrate a different proposition: that Congress could not pass legislation codifying the rule and reached a short-term compromise instead.</p>\n<p>Reliance interests do not require us to reaffirm <i>Dr. Miles.</i> To be sure, reliance on a judicial opinion is a significant reason to adhere to it, <i>Payne v. Tennessee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span>, 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991), especially \"in cases involving property and contract rights,\" <i>Khan,</i> 522 U.S., at 20, 118 S.Ct. 275. The reliance interests here, however, like the reliance interests in <i>Khan,</i> cannot justify an inefficient rule, especially because the narrowness of the rule has allowed manufacturers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2725</span> to set minimum resale prices in other ways. And while the <i>Dr. Miles</i> rule is longstanding, resale price maintenance was legal under fair trade laws in a majority of States for a large part of the past century up until 1975.</p>\n<p>It is also of note that during this time \"when the legal environment in the [United States] was most favorable for [resale price maintenance], no more than a tiny fraction of manufacturers ever employed [resale price maintenance] contracts.\" Overstreet 6; see also <i>id.,</i> at 169 (noting that \"no more than one percent of manufacturers, accounting for no more than ten percent of consumer goods purchases, ever employed [resale price maintenance] in any single year in the [United States]\"); Scherer &amp; Ross 549 (noting that \"[t]he fraction of U.S. retail sales covered by [resale price maintenance] in its heyday has been variously estimated at from 4 to 10 percent\"). To the extent consumers demand cheap goods, judging vertical price restraints under the rule of reason will not prevent the market from providing them. Cf. Easterbrook 152-153 (noting that \"S.S. Kresge (the old K-Mart) flourished during the days of manufacturers' greatest freedom\" because \"discount stores offer a combination of price and service that many customers value\" and that \"[n]othing in restricted dealing threatens the ability of consumers to find low prices\"); Scherer &amp; Ross 557 (noting that \"for the most part, the effects of the [Consumer Goods Pricing Act] were imperceptible because the forces of competition had already repealed the [previous antitrust exemption] in their own quiet way\").</p>\n<p>For these reasons the Court's decision in <i>Dr. Miles Medical Co. v.

See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Trenton Potteries Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101026\"><a href=\"/opinion/101026/united-states-v-trenton-potteries-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span>, 399-401, 47 S.Ct. 377, 71 L.Ed. 700 (1927); <i>NYNEX Corp. v.

That <i>per se</i> rule is one upon which the legal profession, business, and the public have relied for close to a century. Today the Court holds that courts must determine the lawfulness of minimum resale price maintenance by applying, not a bright-line <i>per se</i> rule, but a circumstance-specific \"rule of reason.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2725. And in doing so it overturns <i>Dr. Miles.</i></p>\n<p>The Court justifies its departure from ordinary considerations of <i>stare decisis</i> by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2726</span> pointing to a set of arguments well known in the antitrust literature for close to half a century. See <i>ante,</i> at 2715-2716. Congress has repeatedly found in these arguments insufficient grounds for overturning the <i>per se</i> rule. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Hearings on H.R. 10527 et al. before the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 74-76, 89, 99, 101-102, 192-195, 261-262 (1958). And, in my view, they do not warrant the Court's now overturning so well-established a legal precedent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Sherman Act seeks to maintain a marketplace free of anticompetitive practices, in particular those enforced by agreement among private firms. The law assumes that such a marketplace, free of private restrictions, will tend to bring about the lower prices, better products, and more efficient production processes that consumers typically desire. In determining the lawfulness of particular practices, courts often apply a \"rule of reason.\" They examine both a practice's likely anticompetitive effects and its beneficial business justifications. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111239\"><a href=\"/opinion/111239/national-collegiate-athletic-assn-v-board-of-regen/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 109-110, and n. 39, 104 S.Ct. 2948, 82 L.Ed.2d 70 (1984); <i>National Soc. of Professional Engineers v.

Should they apply a <i>per se</i> rule (or a variation) that would make minimum resale price maintenance always (or <i>almost</i> always) unlawful? Should they apply a \"rule of reason\"? Were the Court writing on a blank slate, I would find these questions difficult. But, of course, the Court is not writing on a blank slate, and that fact makes a considerable legal difference.</p>\n<p>To best explain why the question would be difficult were we deciding it afresh, I briefly summarize several classical arguments for and against the use of a <i>per se</i> rule. The arguments focus on three sets of considerations, those involving: (1) potential anticompetitive effects, (2) potential benefits, and (3) administration. The difficulty arises out of the fact that the different sets of considerations point in different directions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law \u00b6\u00b6 1628-1633, pp. 330-392 (1st ed.1989) (hereinafter Areeda); 8 P. Areeda &amp; H.

Chi. L.Rev. 6, 22-26 (1981); Brief for William S. Comanor and Frederic M. Scherer as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7-10.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, agreements setting minimum resale prices may have serious anticompetitive consequences. <i>In respect to dealers:</i> Resale price maintenance agreements, rather like horizontal price agreements, can diminish or eliminate price competition among dealers of a single brand or (if practiced generally by manufacturers) among multibrand dealers. In doing so, they can prevent dealers from offering customers the lower prices that many customers prefer; they can prevent dealers from responding to changes in demand, say falling demand, by cutting prices; they can encourage dealers to substitute service, for price, competition, thereby threatening wastefully to attract too many resources into that portion of the industry; they can inhibit expansion by more efficient dealers whose lower prices might otherwise attract more customers, stifling the development of new, more efficient modes of retailing; and so forth. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6 1632c, at 319-321; Steiner, The Evolution and Applications of Dual-Stage Thinking, 49 The Antitrust Bulletin 877, 899-900 (2004); Comanor, Vertical Price-Fixing, Vertical Market Restrictions, and the New Antitrust Policy, 98 Harv. L.Rev. 983, 990-1000 (1985).</p>\n<p><i>In respect to producers:</i> Resale price maintenance agreements can help to reinforce the competition-inhibiting behavior of firms in concentrated industries. In such industries firms may tacitly collude, <i>i.e.,</i> observe each other's pricing behavior, each understanding that price cutting by one firm is likely to trigger price competition by all. See 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6 1632d, at 321-323; P. Areeda &amp; L. Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis \u00b6\u00b6 231-233, pp. 276-283 (4th ed.1988) (hereinafter Areeda &amp; Kaplow). Cf. <i>United States v. Container Corp. of America,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107820\"><a href=\"/opinion/107820/united-states-v-container-corporation-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 89 S.Ct. 510, 21 L.Ed.2d 526 (1969); Areeda &amp; Kaplow \u00b6\u00b6 247-253, at 327-348. Where that is so, resale price maintenance can make it easier for each producer to identify (by observing retail markets) when a competitor has begun to cut prices. And a producer who cuts wholesale prices <i>without</i> lowering the minimum resale price will stand to gain little, if anything, in increased profits, because the dealer will be unable to stimulate increased consumer demand by passing along the producer's price cut to consumers. In either case, resale price maintenance agreements will tend to prevent price competition from \"breaking out\"; and they will thereby tend to stabilize producer prices. See Pitofsky 1490-1491. Cf., <i>e.g., </i><i>Container Corp., supra,</i> at 336-337, 89 S.Ct. 510.</p>\n<p>Those who express concern about the potential anticompetitive effects find empirical support in the behavior of prices before, and then after, Congress in 1975 repealed the Miller-Tydings Fair Trade Act, 50 Stat. 693, and the McGuire Act, 66 Stat. 631. Those Acts had permitted (but not required) individual States to enact \"fair trade\" laws authorizing minimum resale price maintenance. At the time of repeal minimum resale price maintenance was lawful in 36 States; it was unlawful in 14 States. See Hearings on S. 408 before the Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 173 (1975) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2728</span> (hereinafter Hearings on S. 408) (statement of Thomas E. Kauper, Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division). Comparing prices in the former States with prices in the latter States, the Department of Justice argued that minimum resale price maintenance had raised prices by 19% to 27%. See Hearings on H.R. 2384 before the Subcommittee on Monopolies and Commercial Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 122 (1975) (hereinafter Hearings on H.R. 2384) (statement of Keith I. Clearwaters, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division).</p>\n<p>After repeal, minimum resale price maintenance agreements were unlawful <i>per se</i> in every State. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) staff, after studying numerous price surveys, wrote that collectively the surveys \"indicate[d] that [resale price maintenance] in most cases increased the prices of products sold with [resale price maintenance].\" Bureau of Economics Staff Report to the FTC, T. Overstreet, Resale Price Maintenance: Economic Theories and Empirical Evidence, 160 (1983) (hereinafter Overstreet). Most economists today agree that, in the words of a prominent antitrust treatise, \"resale price maintenance tends to produce higher consumer prices than would otherwise be the case.\" 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6 1604b, at 40 (finding \"[t]he evidence ... persuasive on this point\"). See also Brief for William S. Comanor and Frederic M. Scherer as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 4 (\"It is uniformly acknowledged that [resale price maintenance] and other vertical restraints lead to higher consumer prices\").</p>\n<p>On the other hand, those favoring resale price maintenance have long argued that resale price maintenance agreements can provide important consumer benefits. The majority lists two: First, such agreements can facilitate new entry. <i>Ante,</i> at 2715-2716. For example, a newly entering producer wishing to build a product name might be able to convince dealers to help it do so\u0097if, but only if, the producer can assure those dealers that they will later recoup their investment. Without resale price maintenance, late-entering dealers might take advantage of the earlier investment and, through price competition, drive prices down to the point where the early dealers cannot recover what they spent. By assuring the initial dealers that such later price competition will not occur, resale price maintenance can encourage them to carry the new product, thereby helping the new producer succeed. See 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6\u00b6 1617a, 1631b, at 193-196, 308. The result might be increased competition at the producer level, <i>i.e.,</i> greater <i>inter</i>-brand competition, that brings with it net consumer benefits.</p>\n<p>Second, without resale price maintenance a producer might find its efforts to sell a product undermined by what resale price maintenance advocates call \"free riding.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2715-2716. Suppose a producer concludes that it can succeed only if dealers provide certain services, say, product demonstrations, high quality shops, advertising that creates a certain product image, and so forth. Without resale price maintenance, some dealers might take a \"free ride\" on the investment that others make in providing those services. Such a dealer would save money by not paying for those services and could consequently cut its own price and increase its own sales. Under these circumstances, dealers might prove unwilling to invest in the provision of necessary services. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6\u00b6 1611-1613, 1631c, at 126-165, 309-313; R. Posner, Antitrust Law 172-173 (2d ed.2001); R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 290-291 (1978) (hereinafter Bork); Easterbrook 146-149.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2729</span> Moreover, where a producer and not a group of dealers seeks a resale price maintenance agreement, there is a special reason to believe some such benefits exist. That is because, other things being equal, producers should want to encourage price competition among their dealers. By doing so they will often increase profits by selling more of their product. See <i>Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 56, n. 24, 97 S.Ct. 2549; Bork 290. And that is so, even if the producer possesses sufficient market power to earn a super-normal profit. That is to say, other things being equal, the producer will benefit by charging his dealers a competitive (or even a higher-than-competitive) wholesale price while encouraging price competition among them. Hence, if the producer is the moving force, the producer must have some special reason for wanting resale price maintenance; and in the absence of, say, concentrated producer markets (where that special reason might consist of a desire to stabilize wholesale prices), that special reason may well reflect the special circumstances just described: new entry, \"free riding,\" or variations on those themes.</p>\n<p>The upshot is, as many economists suggest, sometimes resale price maintenance can prove harmful; sometimes it can bring benefits. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Economists as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 16; 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6\u00b6 1631-1632, at 306-328; Pitofsky 1495; Scherer 706-707. But before concluding that courts should consequently apply a rule of reason, I would ask such questions as, how often are harms or benefits likely to occur? How easy is it to separate the beneficial sheep from the antitrust goats?</p>\n<p>Economic discussion, such as the studies the Court relies upon, can <i>help</i> provide answers to these questions, and in doing so, economics can, and should, inform antitrust law. But antitrust law cannot, and should not, precisely replicate economists' (sometimes conflicting) views. That is because law, unlike economics, is an administrative system the effects of which depend upon the content of rules and precedents only as they are applied by judges and juries in courts and by lawyers advising their clients. And that fact means that courts will often bring their own administrative judgment to bear, sometimes applying rules of <i>per se</i> unlawfulness to business practices even when those practices sometimes produce benefits. See, <i>e.g.,</i> F.M. Scherer &amp; D. Ross, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 335-339 (3d ed.1990) (hereinafter Scherer &amp; Ross) (describing some circumstances under which price-fixing agreements could be more beneficial than \"unfettered competition,\" but also noting potential costs of moving from a <i>per se</i> ban to a rule of reasonableness assessment of such agreements).</p>\n<p>I have already described studies and analyses that suggest (though they cannot prove) that resale price maintenance can cause harms with some regularity\u0097and certainly when dealers are the driving force. But what about benefits? How often, for example, will the benefits to which the Court points occur in practice? I can find no economic consensus on this point. There is a consensus in the literature that \"free riding\" takes place. But \"free riding\" often takes place in the economy without any legal effort to stop it. Many visitors to California take free rides on the Pacific Coast Highway. We all benefit freely from ideas, such as that of creating the first supermarket. Dealers often take a \"free ride\" on investments that others have made in building a product's name and reputation. The question is how often the \"free riding\" problem is serious enough significantly to deter dealer investment.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2730</span> To be more specific, one can easily <i>imagine</i> a dealer who refuses to provide important presale services, say a detailed explanation of how a product works (or who fails to provide a proper atmosphere in which to sell expensive perfume or alligator billfolds), lest customers use that \"free\" service (or enjoy the psychological benefit arising when a high-priced retailer stocks a particular brand of billfold or handbag) and then buy from another dealer at a lower price. Sometimes this must happen in reality. But does it happen often? We do, after all, live in an economy where firms, despite <i>Dr. Miles' per se</i> rule, still sell complex technical equipment (as well as expensive perfume and alligator billfolds) to consumers.</p>\n<p>All this is to say that the ultimate question is not whether, but <i>how much,</i> \"free riding\" of this sort takes place. And, after reading the briefs, I must answer that question with an uncertain \"sometimes.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for William S. Comanor and Frederic M. Scherer as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 6-7 (noting \"skepticism in the economic literature about how often [free riding] actually occurs\"); Scherer &amp; Ross 551-555 (explaining the \"severe limitations\" of the free-rider justification for resale price maintenance); Pitofsky, Why <i>Dr. Miles</i> Was Right, 8 Regulation, No. 1, pp. 27, 29-30 (Jan./Feb.1984) (similar analysis).</p>\n<p>How easily can courts identify instances in which the benefits are likely to outweigh potential harms? My own answer is, <i>not very easily.</i> For one thing, it is often difficult to identify <i>who</i>\u0097producer or dealer\u0097is the moving force behind any given resale price maintenance agreement. Suppose, for example, several large multibrand retailers all sell resale-price-maintained products. Suppose further that small producers set retail prices because they fear that, otherwise, the large retailers will favor (say, by allocating better shelf-space) the goods of other producers who practice resale price maintenance. Who \"initiated\" this practice, the retailers hoping for considerable insulation from retail competition, or the producers, who simply seek to deal best with the circumstances they find? For another thing, as I just said, it is difficult to determine just when, and where, the \"free riding\" problem is serious enough to warrant legal protection.</p>\n<p>I recognize that scholars have sought to develop check lists and sets of questions that will help courts separate instances where anticompetitive harms are more likely from instances where only benefits are likely to be found. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6\u00b6 1633c-1633e, at 330-339. See also Brief for William S. Comanor and Frederic M. Scherer as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 8-10. But applying these criteria in court is often easier said than done. The Court's invitation to consider the existence of \"market power,\" for example, <i>ante,</i> at 2720, invites lengthy time-consuming argument among competing experts, as they seek to apply abstract, highly technical, criteria to often ill-defined markets. And resale price maintenance cases, unlike a major merger or monopoly case, are likely to prove numerous and involve only private parties. One cannot fairly expect judges and juries in such cases to apply complex economic criteria without making a considerable number of mistakes, which themselves may impose serious costs. See, <i>e.g.,</i> H. Hovenkamp, The Antitrust Enterprise 105 (2005) (litigating a rule of reason case is \"one of the most costly procedures in antitrust practice\"). See also Bok, Section 7 of the Clayton Act and the Merging of Law and Economics, 74 Harv. L.Rev. 226, 238-247 (1960) (describing lengthy FTC efforts to apply complex criteria in a merger case).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2731</span> Are there special advantages to a bright-line rule? Without such a rule, it is often unfair, and consequently impractical, for enforcement officials to bring criminal proceedings. And since enforcement resources are limited, that loss may tempt some producers or dealers to enter into agreements that are, on balance, anticompetitive.</p>\n<p>Given the uncertainties that surround key items in the overall balance sheet, particularly in respect to the \"administrative\" questions, I can concede to the majority that the problem is difficult. And, if forced to decide now, at most I might agree that the <i>per se</i> rule should be slightly modified to allow an exception for the more easily identifiable and temporary condition of \"new entry.\" See Pitofsky 1495. But I am not now forced to decide this question. The question before us is not what should be the rule, starting from scratch. We here must decide whether to change a clear and simple price-related antitrust rule that the courts have applied for nearly a century.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We write, not on a blank slate, but on a slate that begins with <i>Dr. Miles</i> and goes on to list a century's worth of similar cases, massive amounts of advice that lawyers have provided their clients, and untold numbers of business decisions those clients have taken in reliance upon that advice. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103966\"><a href=\"/opinion/103966/united-states-v-bausch-lomb-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 721, 64 S.Ct. 805, 88 L.Ed. 1024 (1944); <i>Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 51, n. 18, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (\"The <i>per se</i> illegality of [vertical] price restrictions has been established firmly for many years ...\"). Indeed a Westlaw search shows that <i>Dr. Miles</i> itself has been cited dozens of times in this Court and hundreds of times in lower courts. Those who wish this Court to change so well-established a legal precedent bear a heavy burden of proof. See <i>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109680\"><a href=\"/opinion/109680/illinois-brick-co-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span>, 736, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977) (noting, in declining to overrule an earlier case interpreting \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, that \"considerations of <i>stare decisis</i> weigh heavily in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation of its legislation\"). I am not aware of any case in which this Court has overturned so well-established a statutory precedent. Regardless, I do not see how the Court can claim that ordinary criteria for over-ruling an earlier case have been met. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112786\"><a href=\"/opinion/112786/planned-parenthood-of-southeastern-pa-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, 854-855, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992).

In fact, there has been one important change that argues strongly to the contrary. In 1975, Congress repealed the McGuire and Miller-Tydings Acts. See Consumer Goods Pricing Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 801. And it thereby consciously <i>extended Dr. Miles' per se</i> rule. Indeed, at that time the Department of Justice and the FTC, then urging application of the <i>per se</i> rule, discussed virtually every argument presented now to this Court as well as others not here presented. And they explained to Congress why Congress should reject them. See Hearings on S. 408, at 176-177 (statement of Thomas E. Kauper, Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division); <i>id.,</i> at 170-172 (testimony of Lewis A. Engman, Chairman of the FTC); Hearings on H.R. 2384, at 113-114 (testimony <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2732</span> of Keith I. Clearwaters, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division). Congress fully understood, and consequently intended, that the result of its repeal of McGuire and Miller-Tydings would be to make minimum resale price maintenance <i>per se</i> unlawful. See, <i>e.g.,</i> S.Rep. No. 94-466, pp. 1-3 (1975), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1975, pp. 1569, 1570-71 (\"Without [the exemptions authorized by the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts,] the agreements they authorize would violate the antitrust laws.... [R]epeal of the fair trade laws generally will prohibit manufacturers from enforcing resale prices\"). See also <i>Sylvania, supra,</i> at 51, n. 18, 97 S.Ct. 2549 (\"Congress recently has expressed its approval of a <i>per se</i> analysis of vertical price restrictions by repealing those provisions of the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts allowing fair-trade pricing at the option of the individual States\").</p>\n<p>Congress did not prohibit this Court from reconsidering the <i>per se</i> rule. But enacting major legislation premised upon the existence of that rule constitutes important public reliance upon that rule. And doing so aware of the relevant arguments constitutes even stronger reliance upon the Court's keeping the rule, at least in the absence of some significant change in respect to those arguments.</p>\n<p>Have there been any such changes? There have been a few economic studies, described in some of the briefs, that argue, contrary to the testimony of the Justice Department and FTC to Congress in 1975, that resale price maintenance is not harmful. One study, relying on an analysis of litigated resale price maintenance cases from 1975 to 1982, concludes that resale price maintenance does not ordinarily involve producer or dealer collusion. See Ippolito, Resale Price Maintenance: Empirical Evidence from Litigation, 34 J. Law &amp; Econ. 263, 281-282, 292 (1991). But this study equates the failure of plaintiffs to <i>allege</i> collusion with the <i>absence</i> of collusion\u0097an equation that overlooks the superfluous nature of allegations of horizontal collusion in a resale price maintenance case and the tacit form that such collusion might take. See H. Hovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy \u00a7 11.3c, p. 464, n. 19 (3d ed.2005); <i>supra,</i> at 2711-2713.</p>\n<p>The other study provides a theoretical basis for concluding that resale price maintenance \"need not lead to higher retail prices.\" Marvel &amp; McCafferty, The Political Economy of Resale Price Maintenance, 94 J. Pol. Econ. 1074, 1075 (1986). But this study develops a theoretical model \"under the assumption that [resale price maintenance] is efficiency-enhancing.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Its only empirical support is a 1940 study that the authors acknowledge is much criticized. See <i>id.,</i> at 1091. And many other economists take a different view. See Brief for William S. Comanor and Frederic M. Scherer as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 4.</p>\n<p>Regardless, taken together, these studies at most may offer some mild support for the majority's position. But they cannot constitute a major change in circumstances.</p>\n<p>Petitioner and some <i>amici</i> have also presented us with newer studies that show that resale price maintenance sometimes brings consumer benefits. Overstreet 119-129 (describing numerous case studies). But the proponents of a <i>per se</i> rule have always conceded as much. What is remarkable about the majority's arguments is that <i>nothing</i> in this respect <i>is new.</i> See <i>supra,</i> at 2711, 2716 (citing articles and congressional testimony going back several decades). The only new feature of these arguments lies in the fact that the most current advocates of overruling <i>Dr. Miles</i> have abandoned a host of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2733</span> other not-very-persuasive arguments upon which prior resale price maintenance proponents used to rely. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 Areeda \u00b6 1631a, at 350-352 (listing \"`[t]raditional' justifications\" for resale price maintenance).</p>\n<p>The one arguable exception consists of the majority's claim that \"even absent free riding,\" resale price maintenance \"may be the most efficient way to expand the manufacturer's market share by inducing the retailer's performance and allowing it to use its own initiative and experience in providing valuable services.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2716. I cannot count this as an exception, however, because I do not understand how, in the absence of free-riding (and assuming competitiveness), an established producer would need resale price maintenance. Why, on these assumptions, would a dealer not \"expand\" its \"market share\" as best that dealer sees fit, obtaining appropriate payment from consumers in the process? There may be an answer to this question. But I have not seen it. And I do not think that we should place significant weight upon justifications that the parties do not explain with sufficient clarity for a generalist judge to understand.</p>\n<p>No one claims that the American economy has changed in ways that might support the majority. Concentration in retailing has increased. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondent 18 (since minimum resale price maintenance was banned nationwide in 1975, the total number of retailers has dropped while the growth in sales per store has risen); Brief for American Antitrust Institute as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 17, n. 20 (citing private study reporting that the combined sales of the 10 largest retailers worldwide has grown to nearly 30% of total retail sales of top 250 retailers; also quoting 1999 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report stating that the \"`last twenty years have seen momentous changes in retail distribution including significant increases in concentration'\"); Mamen, Facing Goliath: Challenging the Impacts of Supermarket Consolidation on our Local Economies, Communities, and Food Security, The Oakland Institute, 1 Policy Brief, No. 3, pp. 1, 2 (Spring 2007), http://www.oakland institute.org/pdfs/facing_goliath.pdf (as visited June 25, 2007, and available in Clerks of Court's case file) (noting that \"[f]or many decades, the top five food retail firms in the U.S. controlled less than 20 percent of the market\"; from 1997 to 2000, \"the top five firms increased their market share from 24 to 42 percent of all retail sales\"; and \"[b]y 2003, they controlled over half of all grocery sales\"). That change, other things being equal, may enable (and motivate) more retailers, accounting for a greater percentage of total retail sales volume, to seek resale price maintenance, thereby making it more difficult for price-cutting competitors (perhaps internet retailers) to obtain market share.</p>\n<p>Nor has anyone argued that concentration among manufacturers that might use resale price maintenance has diminished significantly. And as far as I can tell, it has not. Consider household electrical appliances, which a study from the late 1950's suggests constituted a significant portion of those products subject to resale price maintenance at that time. See Hollander, United States of America, in Resale Price Maintenance 67, 80-81 (B. Yamey ed.1966). Although it is somewhat difficult to compare census data from 2002 with that from several decades ago (because of changes in the classification system), it is clear that at least some subsets of the household electrical appliance industry are <i>more</i> concentrated, in terms of manufacturer market power, now than they were then. For instance, the top eight domestic manufacturers of household cooking appliances accounted for 68% <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2734</span> of the domestic market (measured by value of shipments) in 1963 (the earliest date for which I was able to find data), compared with 77% in 2002. See Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, 1972 Census of Manufacturers, Special Report Series, Concentration Ratios in Manufacturing, No. MC72(SR)-2, p. SR2-38 (1975) (hereinafter 1972 Census); Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, 2002 Economic Census, Concentration Ratios: 2002, No. EC02-31SR-1, p. 55 (2006) (hereinafter 2002 Census). The top eight domestic manufacturers of household laundry equipment accounted for 95% of the domestic market in 1963 (90% in 1958), compared with 99% in 2002. 1972 Census, at SR2-38; 2002 Census, at 55. And the top eight domestic manufacturers of household refrigerators and freezers accounted for 91% of the domestic market in 1963, compared with 95% in 2002. 1972 Census, at SR2-38; 2002 Census, at 55. Increased concentration among manufacturers increases the likelihood that producer-originated resale price maintenance will prove more prevalent today than in years past, and more harmful. At the very least, the majority has not explained how these, or other changes in the economy could help support its position.</p>\n<p>In sum, there is no relevant change. And without some such change, there is no ground for abandoning a well-established antitrust rule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>With the preceding discussion in mind, I would consult the list of factors that our case law indicates are relevant when we consider overruling an earlier case. Justice SCALIA, writing separately in another of our cases this Term, well summarizes that law. See <i>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S. at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 2684-2686, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1804336</span></span>. (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). And every relevant factor he mentions argues against overruling <i>Dr. Miles</i> here.</p>\n<p>First, the Court applies <i>stare decisis</i> more \"rigidly\" in statutory than in constitutional cases. See <i>Glidden Co. v. Zdanok,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106447\"><a href=\"/opinion/106447/glidden-co-v-zdanok/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></a></span>, 543, 82 S.Ct. 1459, 8 L.Ed.2d 671 (1962); <i>Illinois Brick Co.,</i> 431 U.S., at 736, 97 S.Ct. 2061. This is a statutory case.</p>\n<p>Second, the Court does sometimes overrule cases that it decided wrongly only a reasonably short time ago. As Justice SCALIA put it, \"[o]verruling a <i>constitutional</i> case decided just a few years earlier is far from unprecedented.\" <i>Wisconsin Right to Life,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 2685, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1804336</span></span> (emphasis added). We here overrule one <i>statutory</i> case, <i>Dr. Miles,</i> decided 100 years ago, and we overrule the cases that reaffirmed its <i>per se</i> rule in the intervening years. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Trenton Potteries,</i> 273 U.S., at 399-401, 47 S.Ct. 377; <i>Bausch &amp; Lomb,</i> 321 U.S., at 721, 64 S.Ct. 805; <i>United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106009\"><a href=\"/opinion/106009/united-states-v-parke-davis-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 45-47, 80 S.Ct. 503, 4 L.Ed.2d 505 (1960); <i>Simpson v. Union Oil Co. of Cal.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106805\"><a href=\"/opinion/106805/simpson-v-union-oil-co-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16-17, 84 S.Ct. 1051, 12 L.Ed.2d 98 (1964).</p>\n<p>Third, the fact that a decision creates an \"unworkable\" legal regime argues in favor of overruling. See <i>Payne v. Tennessee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span>, 827-828, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991); <i>Swift &amp; Co. v. Wickham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107115\"><a href=\"/opinion/107115/swift-co-v-wickham/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 116, 86 S.Ct. 258, 15 L.Ed.2d 194 (1965). Implementation of the <i>per se</i> rule, even with the complications attendant the exception allowed for in <i>United States v. Colgate &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99426\"><a href=\"/opinion/99426/united-states-v-colgate-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 39 S.Ct. 465, 63 L.Ed. 992 (1919), has proved practical over the course of the last century, particularly when compared with the many complexities of litigating a case under the \"rule of reason\" regime. No one has shown how moving from the <i>Dr. Miles</i> regime to \"rule of reason\" analysis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2735</span> would make the legal regime governing minimum resale price maintenance more \"administrable,\" <i>Wisconsin Right to Life,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 2685, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1804336</span></span> (opinion of SCALIA, J.), particularly since <i>Colgate</i> would remain good law with respect to <i>unreasonable</i> price maintenance.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the fact that a decision \"unsettles\" the law may argue in favor of overruling. See <i>Sylvania,</i> 433 U.S., at 47, 97 S.Ct. 2549; <i>Wisconsin Right to Life,</i> ___ U.S., at ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 2685-2686, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1804336</span></span> (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The <i>per se</i> rule is well-settled law, as the Court itself has previously recognized. <i>Sylvania, supra,</i> at 51, n. 18, 97 S.Ct. 2549. It is the majority's change here that will unsettle the law.</p>\n<p>Fifth, the fact that a case involves property rights or contract rights, where reliance interests are involved, argues against overruling. <i>Payne, supra,</i> at 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597. This case involves contract rights and perhaps property rights (consider shopping malls). And there has been considerable reliance upon the <i>per se</i> rule. As I have said, Congress relied upon the continued vitality of <i>Dr. Miles</i> when it repealed Miller-Tydings and McGuire. <i>Supra,</i> at 2716-2717. The Executive Branch argued for repeal on the assumption that <i>Dr. Miles</i> stated the law. <i>Ibid.</i> Moreover, whole sectors of the economy have come to rely upon the <i>per se</i> rule. A factory outlet store tells us that the rule \"form[s] an essential part of the regulatory background against which [that firm] and many other discount retailers have financed, structured, and operated their businesses.\" Brief for Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corp. as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 5. The Consumer Federation of America tells us that large low-price retailers would not exist without <i>Dr. Miles</i>; minimum resale price maintenance, \"by stabilizing price levels and preventing low-price competition, erects a potentially insurmountable barrier to entry for such low-price innovators.\" Brief for Consumer Federation of America as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 5, 7-9 (discussing, <i>inter alia,</i> comments by Wal-Mart's founder 25 years ago that relaxation of the <i>per se</i> ban on minimum resale price maintenance would be a \"`great danger'\" to Wal-Mart's then-relatively-nascent business). See also Brief for American Antitrust Institute as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 14-15, and sources cited therein (making the same point). New distributors, including internet distributors, have similarly invested time, money, and labor in an effort to bring yet lower cost goods to Americans.</p>\n<p>This Court's overruling of the <i>per se</i> rule jeopardizes this reliance, and more. What about malls built on the assumption that a discount distributor will remain an anchor tenant? What about home buyers who have taken a home's distance from such a mall into account? What about Americans, producers, distributors, and consumers, who have understandably assumed, at least for the last 30 years, that price competition is a legally guaranteed way of life? The majority denies none of this. It simply says that these \"reliance interests ..., like the reliance interests in <i>Khan,</i> cannot justify an inefficient rule.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2724.</p>\n<p>The Court minimizes the importance of this reliance, adding that it \"is also of note\" that at the time resale price maintenance contracts were lawful \"`no more than a tiny fraction of manufacturers ever employed'\" the practice. <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting Overstreet 6). By \"tiny\" the Court means manufacturers that accounted for up to \"`ten percent of consumer goods purchases'\" annually. <i>Ibid.</i> That figure in today's economy equals just over $300 billion. See Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2736</span> Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2007, p. 649 (126th ed.) (over $3 trillion in U.S. retail sales in 2002). Putting the Court's estimate together with the Justice Department's early 1970's study translates a legal regime that permits all resale price maintenance into retail bills that are higher by an average of roughly $750 to $1000 annually for an American family of four. Just how much higher retail bills will be after the Court's decision today, of course, depends upon what is now unknown, namely how courts will decide future cases under a \"rule of reason.\" But these figures indicate that the amounts involved are important to American families and cannot be dismissed as \"tiny.\"</p>\n<p>Sixth, the fact that a rule of law has become \"embedded\" in our \"national culture\" argues strongly against overruling. <i>Dickerson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118380\"><a href=\"/opinion/118380/dickerson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span>, 443-444, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000). The <i>per se</i> rule forbidding minimum resale price maintenance agreements has long been \"embedded\" in the law of antitrust. It involves price, the economy's \"`central nervous system.'\" <i>National Soc. of Professional Engineers,</i> 435 U.S., at 692, 98 S.Ct. 1355 (quoting <i>Socony-Vacuum Oil,</i> 310 U.S., at 226, n. 59, 60 S.Ct. 811). It reflects a basic antitrust assumption (that consumers often prefer lower prices to more service). It embodies a basic antitrust objective (providing consumers with a free choice about such matters). And it creates an easily administered and enforceable bright line, \"Do not agree about price,\" that businesses as well as lawyers have long understood.</p>\n<p>The only contrary <i>stare decisis</i> factor that the majority mentions consists of its claim that this Court has \"[f]rom the beginning... treated the Sherman Act as a common-law statute,\" and has previously overruled antitrust precedent. <i>Ante,</i> at 2720, 2721-2722. It points in support to <i>State Oil Co. v. Khan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118149\"><a href=\"/opinion/118149/state-oil-co-v-khan/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 118 S.Ct. 275, 139 L.Ed.2d 199 (1997), overruling <i>Albrecht v. Herald Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107615\"><a href=\"/opinion/107615/albrecht-v-herald-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 88 S.Ct. 869, 19 L.Ed.2d 998 (1968), in which this Court had held that <i>maximum</i> resale price agreements were unlawful <i>per se,</i> and to <i>Sylvania,</i> overruling <i>United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107491\"><a href=\"/opinion/107491/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 87 S.Ct. 1856, 18 L.Ed.2d 1249 (1967), in which this Court had held that producer-imposed territorial limits were unlawful <i>per se.</i></p>\n<p>The Court decided <i>Khan,</i> however, 29 years after <i>Albrecht</i>\u0097still a significant period, but nowhere close to the century <i>Dr. Miles</i> has stood. The Court specifically noted the <i>lack</i> of any significant reliance upon <i>Albrecht.</i> 522 U.S., at 18-19, 118 S.Ct. 275 (<i>Albrecht</i> has had \"little or no relevance to ongoing enforcement of the Sherman Act\"). <i>Albrecht</i> had far less support in traditional antitrust principles than did <i>Dr. Miles.</i> Compare, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6 1632, at 316-328 (analyzing potential harms of minimum resale price maintenance), with <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 1637, at 352-361 (analyzing potential harms of maximum resale price maintenance). See also, <i>e.g.,</i> Pitofsky 1490, n. 17. And Congress had nowhere expressed support for <i>Albrecht's</i> rule. <i>Khan, supra,</i> at 19, 118 S.Ct. 275.</p>\n<p>In <i>Sylvania,</i> the Court, in overruling <i>Schwinn,</i> explicitly distinguished <i>Dr. Miles</i> on the ground that while Congress had \"recently ... expressed its approval of a <i>per se</i> analysis of vertical price restrictions\" by repealing the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts, \"[n]o similar expression of congressional intent exists for nonprice restrictions.\" 433 U.S., at 51, n. 18, 97 S.Ct. 2549. Moreover, the Court decided <i>Sylvania</i> only a decade after <i>Schwinn.</i> And it based its overruling on a generally perceived need to avoid \"confusion\" in the law, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2737</span> 433 U.S., at 47-49, 97 S.Ct. 2549, a factor totally absent here.</p>\n<p>The Court suggests that it is following \"the common-law tradition.\" <i>Ante</i> at 2724. But the common law would not have permitted overruling <i>Dr. Miles</i> in these circumstances. Common-law courts rarely overruled well-established earlier rules outright. Rather, they would over time issue decisions that gradually eroded the scope and effect of the rule in question, which might eventually lead the courts to put the rule to rest. One can argue that modifying the <i>per se</i> rule to make an exception, say, for new entry, see Pitofsky 1495, could prove consistent with this approach. To swallow up a century-old precedent, potentially affecting many billions of dollars of sales, is not. The reader should compare today's \"common-law\" decision with Justice Cardozo's decision in <i>Allegheny College v. National Chautauqua Cty. Bank of Jamestown,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></span> (1927), and note a gradualism that does not characterize today's decision.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a Court that rests its decision upon economists' views of the economic merits should also take account of legal scholars' views about common-law overruling. Professors Hart and Sacks list 12 factors (similar to those I have mentioned) that support judicial \"adherence to prior holdings.\" They all support adherence to <i>Dr. Miles</i> here. See H. Hart &amp; A. Sacks, The Legal Process 568-569 (W. Eskridge &amp; P. Frickey eds.1994). Karl Llewellyn has written that the common-law judge's \"conscious reshaping\" of prior law \"must so move as to hold the degree of movement down to the degree to which need truly presses.\" The Bramble Bush 156 (1960). Where here is the pressing need? The Court notes that the FTC argues here in favor of a rule of reason. See <i>ante,</i> at 2720-2721. But both Congress and the FTC, unlike courts, are well-equipped to gather empirical evidence outside the context of a single case. As neither has done so, we cannot conclude with confidence that the gains from eliminating the <i>per se</i> rule will outweigh the costs.</p>\n<p>In sum, every <i>stare decisis</i> concern this Court has ever mentioned counsels against overruling here. It is difficult for me to understand how one can believe both that (1) satisfying a set of <i>stare decisis</i> concerns justifies over-ruling a recent constitutional decision, <i>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S., at ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 2684-2686, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1804336</span></span> (SCALIA, J., joined by KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), but (2) failing to satisfy any of those same concerns nonetheless permits overruling a longstanding statutory decision. Either those concerns are relevant or they are not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The only safe predictions to make about today's decision are that it will likely raise the price of goods at retail and that it will create considerable legal turbulence as lower courts seek to develop workable principles. I do not believe that the majority has shown new or changed conditions sufficient to warrant overruling a decision of such long standing. All ordinary <i>stare decisis</i> considerations indicate the contrary. For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n</div>",
