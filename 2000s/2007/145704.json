Bolton, Boardman, Suhr, Curry &amp; Field LLC, Madison, WI, for Respondents.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice KENNEDY join.</p>\n<p>This is a lawsuit in which it was claimed that conferences held as part of the President's Faith-Based and Community Initiatives program violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because, among other things, President Bush and former Secretary of Education Paige gave speeches that used \"religious imagery\" and praised the efficacy of faith-based programs in delivering social services. The plaintiffs contend that they meet the standing requirements of Article III of the Constitution because they pay federal taxes.</p>\n<p>It has long been established, however, that the payment of taxes is generally not enough to establish standing to challenge an action taken by the Federal Government. In light of the size of the federal budget, it is a complete fiction to argue that an unconstitutional federal expenditure causes an individual federal taxpayer any measurable economic harm. And if every federal taxpayer could sue to challenge any Government expenditure, the federal courts would cease to function as courts of law and would be cast in the role of general complaint bureaus.</p>\n<p>In <i>Flast v. Cohen,</i> 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), we recognized a narrow exception to the general rule against federal taxpayer standing. Under <i>Flast,</i> a plaintiff asserting an Establishment Clause claim has standing to challenge a law authorizing the use of federal funds in a way that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause. In the present case, Congress did not specifically authorize the use of federal funds to pay for the conferences or speeches that the plaintiffs challenged. Instead, the conferences and speeches were paid for out of general Executive Branch appropriations. The Court of Appeals, however, held that the plaintiffs have standing as taxpayers because the conferences were paid for with money appropriated by Congress.</p>\n<p>The question that is presented here is whether this broad reading of <i>Flast</i> is correct. We hold that it is not. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In 2001, the President issued an executive order creating the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives within the Executive Office of the President. Exec. Order No. 13199, 3 CFR 752 (2001 Comp.). The purpose of this new office was to ensure that \"private and charitable community groups, including religious ones ... have the fullest opportunity permitted by law to compete on a level playing field, so long as they achieve valid public purposes\" and adhere to \"the bedrock principles of pluralism, nondiscrimination, evenhandedness, and neutrality.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The office was specifically charged with the task of eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic, legislative, and regulatory barriers that could impede such organizations' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2560</span> effectiveness and ability to compete equally for federal assistance. <i>Id.,</i> at 752-753.</p>\n<p>By separate executive orders, the President also created Executive Department Centers for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives within several federal agencies and departments.<sup>[1]</sup> These centers were given the job of ensuring that faith-based community groups would be eligible to compete for federal financial support without impairing their independence or autonomy, as long as they did \"not use direct Federal financial assistance to support any inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization.\" Exec. Order No. 13279, 3 CFR \u00a7 2(f), p. 260 (2002 Comp.). To this end, the President directed that \"[n]o organization should be discriminated against on the basis of religion or religious belief in the administration or distribution of Federal financial assistance under social service programs,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 2(c), at 260, and that \"[a]ll organizations that receive Federal financial assistance under social services programs should be prohibited from discriminating against beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries of the social services programs on the basis of religion or religious belief,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 2(d), at 260. Petitioners, who have been sued in their official capacities, are the directors of the White House Office and various Executive Department Centers.</p>\n<p>No congressional legislation specifically authorized the creation of the White House Office or the Executive Department Centers. Rather, they were \"created entirely within the executive branch ... by Presidential executive order.\" <i>Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc. v. Chao,</i> 433 F.3d 989, 997 (C.A.7 2006). Nor has Congress enacted any law specifically appropriating money for these entities' activities. Instead, their activities are funded through general Executive Branch appropriations. For example, the Department of Education's Center is funded from money appropriated for the Office of the Secretary of Education, while the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Center is funded through that Department's salaries and expenses account. See Government Accountability Office, Faith-Based and Community Initiative: Improvements in Monitoring Grantees and Measuring Performance Could Enhance Accountability, GAO-06-616, p. 21 (June 2006), online at http://www.gao.gov/new. items/d06616.pdf (as visited June 25, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court's case file); see also Amended Complaint in No. 04-C-381-S (WD Wis.), \u00b6 23, App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a-72a.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The respondents are Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., a nonstock corporation \"opposed to government endorsement of religion,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 5, App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a, and three of its members. Respondents brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, alleging that petitioners violated the Establishment Clause by organizing conferences at which faith-based organizations allegedly \"are singled out as being particularly worthy of federal funding..., and the belief in God is extolled as distinguishing the claimed effectiveness of faith-based social services.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 32, App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a. Respondents further alleged that the content of these conferences sent a message to religious believers \"that they are insiders and favored members <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2561</span> of the political community\" and that the conferences sent the message to nonbelievers \"that they are outsiders\" and \"not full members of the political community.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 37, App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a. In short, respondents alleged that the conferences were designed to promote, and had the effect of promoting, religious community groups over secular ones.</p>\n<p>The only asserted basis for standing was that the individual respondents are federal taxpayers who are \"opposed to the use of Congressional taxpayer appropriations to advance and promote religion.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 10, App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a; see also <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 7-9, App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a-69a. In their capacity as federal taxpayers, respondents sought to challenge Executive Branch expenditures for these conferences, which, they contended, violated the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The District Court dismissed the claims against petitioners for lack of standing. See <i>Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc. v. Towey,</i> No. 04-C-381-S (WD Wis., Nov. 15, 2004), App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a-35a. It concluded that under <i>Flast,</i> 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947, federal taxpayer standing is limited to Establishment Clause challenges to the constitutionality of \"`exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, \u00a7 8.'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a (quoting <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942). Because petitioners in this case acted \"at the President's request and on the President's behalf\" and were not \"charged with the administration of a congressional program,\" the District Court concluded that the challenged activities were \"not `exercises of congressional power'\" sufficient to provide a basis for taxpayer standing under <i>Flast.</i> App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a-34a.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. 433 F.3d 989. The majority read <i>Flast</i> as granting federal taxpayers standing to challenge Executive Branch programs on Establishment Clause grounds so long as the activities are \"financed by a congressional appropriation.\" 433 F.3d, at 997. This was the case, the majority concluded, even where \"there is no statutory program\" enacted by Congress and the funds are \"from appropriations for the general administrative expenses, over which the President and other executive branch officials have a degree of discretionary power.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 994. According to the majority, a taxpayer has standing to challenge anything done by a federal agency or officer so long as \"the marginal or incremental cost to the tax-paying public of the alleged violation of the establishment clause\" is greater than \"zero.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 995.</p>\n<p>In dissent, Judge Ripple opined that the majority's decision reflected a \"dramatic expansion of current standing doctrine,\" <i>id.,</i> at 997, that \"cuts the concept of taxpayer standing loose from its moorings,\" <i>id.,</i> at 998. Noting that \"[t]he executive can do nothing without general budget appropriations from Congress,\" <i>id.,</i> at 1000, he criticized the majority for overstepping <i>Flast's</i> requirement that a \"plaintiff must bring an attack against a disbursement of public funds made in the exercise of <i>Congress'</i> taxing and spending power,\" 433 F.3d, at 1000 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals denied en banc review by a vote of seven to four. 447 F.3d 988 (C.A.7 2006). Concurring in the denial of rehearing, Chief Judge Flaum expressed doubt about the panel decision, but noted that \"the obvious tension which has evolved in this area of jurisprudence... can only be resolved by the Supreme Court.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We granted certiorari to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2562</span> resolve this question, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 722, 166 L.Ed.2d 559 (2006), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Article III of the Constitution limits the judicial power of the United States to the resolution of \"Cases\" and \"Controversies,\" and \"`Article III standing... enforces the Constitution's case-or-controversy requirement.'\" <i>DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno,</i> 547 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 1854, 1861, 164 L.Ed.2d 589 (2006) (quoting <i>Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow,</i> 542 U.S. 1, 11, 124 S.Ct. 2301, 159 L.Ed.2d 98 (2004)). \"`No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary's proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.'\" <i>Raines v. Byrd,</i> 521 U.S. 811, 818, 117 S.Ct. 2312, 138 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997) (quoting <i>Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,</i> 426 U.S. 26, 37, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976)).</p>\n<p>\"[O]ne of the controlling elements in the definition of a case or controversy under Article III\" is standing. <i>ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish,</i> 490 U.S. 605, 613, 109 S.Ct. 2037, 104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989) (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). The requisite elements of Article III standing are well established: \"A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).</p>\n<p>The constitutionally mandated standing inquiry is especially important in a case like this one, in which taxpayers seek \"to challenge laws of general application where their own injury is not distinct from that suffered in general by other taxpayers or citizens.\" <i>ASARCO, supra,</i> at 613, 109 S.Ct. 2037 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). This is because \"[t]he judicial power of the United States defined by Art. III is not an unconditioned authority to determine the constitutionality of legislative or executive acts.\" <i>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</i> 454 U.S. 464, 471, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982). The federal courts are not empowered to seek out and strike down any governmental act that they deem to be repugnant to the Constitution. Rather, federal courts sit \"solely, to decide on the rights of individuals,\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 170, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), and must \"`refrai[n] from passing upon the constitutionality of an act ... unless obliged to do so in the proper performance of our judicial function, when the question is raised by a party whose interests entitle him to raise it.'\" <i>Valley Forge, supra,</i> at 474, 102 S.Ct. 752 (quoting <i>Blair v. United States,</i> 250 U.S. 273, 279, 39 S.Ct. 468, 63 L.Ed. 979 (1919)). As we held over 80 years ago, in another case involving the question of taxpayer standing:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We have no power <i>per se</i> to review and annul acts of Congress on the ground that they are unconstitutional. The question may be considered only when the justification for some direct injury suffered or threatened, presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon such an act .... The party who invokes the power must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.\" <i>Frothingham v. Mellon,</i> decided with <i>Massachusetts v. Mellon,</i> 262 U.S. 447, 488, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923).</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2563</span> B</h2>\n<p>As a general matter, the interest of a federal taxpayer in seeing that Treasury funds are spent in accordance with the Constitution does not give rise to the kind of redressable \"personal injury\" required for Article III standing. Of course, a taxpayer has standing to challenge the <i>collection</i> of a specific tax assessment as unconstitutional; being forced to pay such a tax causes a real and immediate economic injury to the individual taxpayer. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Follett v. Town of McCormick,</i> 321 U.S. 573, 64 S.Ct. 717, 88 L.Ed. 938 (1944) (invalidating tax on preaching on First Amendment grounds). But that is not the interest on which respondents assert standing here. Rather, their claim is that, having paid lawfully collected taxes into the Federal Treasury at some point, they have a continuing, legally cognizable interest in ensuring that those funds are not <i>used</i> by the Government in a way that violates the Constitution.</p>\n<p>We have consistently held that this type of interest is too generalized and attenuated to support Article III standing. In <i>Frothingham,</i> a federal taxpayer sought to challenge federal appropriations for mothers' and children's health, arguing that federal involvement in this area intruded on the rights reserved to the States under the Tenth Amendment and would \"increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take [the plaintiff's] property without due process of law.\" 262 U.S., at 486, 43 S.Ct. 597. We concluded that the plaintiff lacked the kind of particularized injury required for Article III standing:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[I]nterest in the moneys of the Treasury... is shared with millions of others; is comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The administration of any statute, likely to produce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of taxpayers, the extent of whose several liability is indefinite and constantly changing, is essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 487, 43 S.Ct. 597.</blockquote>\n<p>Because the interests of the taxpayer are, in essence, the interests of the public-at-large, deciding a constitutional claim based solely on taxpayer standing \"would be[,] not to decide a judicial controversy, but to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department, an authority which plainly we do not possess.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 489, 43 S.Ct. 597; see also <i>Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes,</i> 302 U.S. 464, 478-479, 58 S.Ct. 300, 82 L.Ed. 374 (1938).</p>\n<p>In <i>Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne,</i> 342 U.S. 429, 433, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952), we reaffirmed this principle, explaining that \"the interests of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal treasury are too indeterminable, remote, uncertain and indirect to furnish a basis for an appeal to the preventive powers of the Court over their manner of expenditure.\" We therefore rejected a state taxpayer's claim of standing to challenge a state law authorizing public school teachers to read from the Bible because \"the grievance which [the plaintiff] sought to litigate ... is not a direct dollars-and-cents injury but is a religious difference.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 434, 72 S.Ct. 394. In so doing, we gave effect to the basic constitutional principle that</p>\n<blockquote>\"a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about government\u0097 claiming only harm to his and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2564</span> benefits him than it does the public at large\u0097does not state an Article III case or controversy.\" <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 573-574, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In <i>Flast,</i> the Court carved out a narrow exception to the general constitutional prohibition against taxpayer standing. The taxpayer-plaintiff in that case challenged the distribution of federal funds to religious schools under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, alleging that such aid violated the Establishment Clause. The Court set out a two-part test for determining whether a federal taxpayer has standing to challenge an allegedly unconstitutional expenditure:</p>\n<blockquote>\"First, the taxpayer must establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative enactment attacked. Thus, a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, \u00a7 8, of the Constitution. It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute .... Secondly, the taxpayer must establish a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged. Under this requirement, the taxpayer must show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art. I, \u00a7 8.\" <i>Flast,</i> 392 U.S., at 102-103, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</blockquote>\n<p>The Court held that the taxpayer-plaintiff in <i>Flast</i> had satisfied both prongs of this test: The plaintiff's \"constitutional challenge [was] made to an exercise by Congress of its power under Art. I, \u00a7 8, to spend for the general welfare,\" and she <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2565</span> alleged a violation of the Establishment Clause, which \"operates as a specific constitutional limitation upon the exercise by Congress of the taxing and spending power conferred by Art. I, \u00a7 8.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 103-104, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Respondents argue that this case falls within the <i>Flast</i> exception, which they read to cover any \"expenditure of government funds in violation of the Establishment Clause.\" Brief for Respondents 12. But this broad reading fails to observe \"the rigor with which the <i>Flast</i> exception to the <i>Frothingham</i> principle ought to be applied.\" <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S., at 481, 102 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n<p>The expenditures at issue in <i>Flast</i> were made pursuant to an express congressional mandate and a specific congressional appropriation. The plaintiff in that case challenged disbursements made under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 27. That Act expressly appropriated the sum of $100 million for fiscal year 1966, \u00a7 201(b), <i>id.,</i> at 36, and authorized the disbursement of those funds to local educational agencies for the education of low-income students, see <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 86, 88 S.Ct. 1942. The Act mandated that local educational agencies receiving such funds \"ma[k]e provision for including special educational services and arrangements (such as dual enrollment, educational radio and television, and mobile educational services and equipment)\" in which students enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools could participate, \u00a7 2, 79 Stat. 30-31. In addition, recipient agencies were required to ensure that \"library resources, textbooks, and other instructional materials\" funded through the grants \"be provided on an equitable basis for the use of children and teachers in private elementary and secondary schools,\" \u00a7 203(a)(3)(B), <i>id.,</i> at 37.</p>\n<p>The expenditures challenged in <i>Flast,</i> then, were funded by a specific congressional appropriation and were disbursed to private schools (including religiously affiliated schools) pursuant to a direct and unambiguous congressional mandate.<sup>[3]</sup> Indeed, the <i>Flast</i> taxpayer-plaintiff's constitutional claim was premised on the contention that if the Government's actions were \"`within the authority and intent of the Act, the Act is to that extent unconstitutional and void.'\" <i>Flast,</i> 392 U.S., at 90, 88 S.Ct. 1942. And the judgment reviewed by this Court in <i>Flast</i> solely concerned the question whether \"if [the challenged] expenditures are authorized by the Act the statute constitutes a `law respecting an establishment of religion' and law `prohibiting the free exercise thereof'\" under the First Amendment. <i>Flast v. Gardner,</i> 271 F.Supp. 1, 2 (S.D.N.Y. 1967).</p>\n<p>Given that the alleged Establishment Clause violation in <i>Flast</i> was funded by a specific congressional appropriation and was undertaken pursuant to an express congressional mandate, the Court concluded that the taxpayer-plaintiffs had established the requisite \"logical link between [their taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.\" In the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2566</span> Court's words, \"[t]heir constitutional challenge [was] made to an exercise by Congress of its power under Art. I, \u00a7 8, to spend for the general welfare.\" 392 U.S., at 90, 88 S.Ct. 1942. But as this Court later noted, <i>Flast</i> \"limited taxpayer standing to challenges directed `only [at] exercises of congressional power'\" under the Taxing and Spending Clause. <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S., at 479, 102 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The link between congressional action and constitutional violation that supported taxpayer standing in <i>Flast</i> is missing here. Respondents do not challenge any specific congressional action or appropriation; nor do they ask the Court to invalidate any congressional enactment or legislatively created program as unconstitutional. That is because the expenditures at issue here were not made pursuant to any Act of Congress. Rather, Congress provided general appropriations to the Executive Branch to fund its day-to-day activities.<sup>[4]</sup> These appropriations did not expressly authorize, direct, or even mention the expenditures of which respondents complain. Those expenditures resulted from executive discretion, not congressional action.</p>\n<p>We have never found taxpayer standing under such circumstances. In <i>Valley Forge,</i> we held that a taxpayer lacked standing to challenge \"a decision by [the federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare] to transfer a parcel of federal property\" to a religious college because this transfer was \"not a congressional action.\" 454 U.S., at 479, 102 S.Ct. 752. In fact, the connection to congressional action was closer in <i>Valley Forge</i> than it is here, because in that case, the \"particular Executive Branch action\" being challenged was at least \"arguably authorized\" by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, which permitted federal agencies to transfer surplus property to private entities. <i>Id.,</i> at 479, n. 15, 102 S.Ct. 752. Nevertheless, we found that the plaintiffs lacked standing because <i>Flast</i> \"limited taxpayer standing to challenges directed `only [at] exercises of congressional power'\" under the Taxing and Spending Clause. 454 U.S., at 479, 102 S.Ct. 752 (quoting <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Similarly, in <i>Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,</i> 418 U.S. 208, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974), the taxpayer-plaintiffs contended that the Incompatibility Clause of Article I prohibited Members of Congress from holding commissions in the Armed Forces Reserve. We held that these plaintiffs lacked standing under <i>Flast</i> because they \"did not challenge an enactment under Art. I, \u00a7 8, but rather the action of the Executive Branch in permitting Members of Congress to maintain their Reserve status.\" 418 U.S., at 228, 94 S.Ct. 2925. This was the case even though the plaintiffs sought to reclaim reservist pay received by those Members\u0097pay that presumably was funded through Congress' general appropriations for the support of the Armed Forces: \"Such relief would follow from the invalidity of Executive action in paying persons who could not lawfully have been reservists, not from the invalidity of the statutes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2567</span> authorizing pay to those who lawfully were Reservists.\" <i>Ibid.,</i> n. 17. See also <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 418 U.S. 166, 175, 94 S.Ct. 2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974) (denying taxpayers standing to compel publication of accounting for the Central Intelligence Agency because \"there is no `logical nexus' between the asserted status of taxpayer and the claimed failure of the Congress to require the Executive to supply a more detailed report of the expenditures of that agency\").</p>\n<p><i>Bowen v. Kendrick,</i> 487 U.S. 589, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988), on which respondents rely heavily, is not to the contrary. In that case, we held that the taxpayer-plaintiffs had standing to mount an as-applied challenge to the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA), which authorized federal grants to private community service groups including religious organizations. The Court found \"a sufficient nexus between the taxpayer's standing as a taxpayer and the congressional exercise of taxing and spending power,\" notwithstanding the fact that the \"the funding authorized by Congress ha[d] flowed through and been administered\" by an Executive Branch official. <i>Id.,</i> at 620, 619, 108 S.Ct. 2562.</p>\n<p>But the key to that conclusion was the Court's recognition that AFLA was \"at heart a program of disbursement of funds pursuant to Congress' taxing and spending powers,\" and that the plaintiffs' claims \"call[ed] into question how the funds authorized by Congress [were] being disbursed <i>pursuant to the AFLA's statutory mandate.\" Id.,</i> at 619-620, 108 S.Ct. 2562 (emphasis added). AFLA not only expressly authorized and appropriated specific funds for grant-making, it also expressly contemplated that some of those moneys might go to projects involving religious groups. See <i>id.,</i> at 595-596, 108 S.Ct. 2562; see also <i>id.,</i> at 623, 108 S.Ct. 2562 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting the \"partnership between governmental and religious institutions contemplated by the AFLA\").<sup>[6]</sup> Unlike this case, <i>Kendrick</i> involved a \"program of disbursement of funds pursuant to Congress' taxing and spending powers\" that \"Congress had created,\" \"authorized,\" and \"mandate[d].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 619-620, 108 S.Ct. 2562.</p>\n<p>Respondents attempt to paint their lawsuit as a <i>Kendrick</i>-style as-applied challenge, but this effort is unavailing for the simple reason that they can cite no statute whose application they challenge. The best they can do is to point to unspecified, lump-sum \"Congressional budget appropriations\" for the general use of the Executive Branch\u0097the allocation of which \"is a[n] administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion.\" <i>Lincoln v. Vigil,</i> 508 U.S. 182, 192, 113 S.Ct. 2024, 124 L.Ed.2d 101 (1993). Characterizing this case as an \"as-applied challenge\" to these general appropriations statutes would stretch the meaning of that term past its breaking point. It cannot be that every legal challenge to a discretionary Executive Branch action implicates the constitutionality of the underlying congressional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2568</span> appropriation. When a criminal defendant charges that a federal agent carried out an unreasonable search or seizure, we do not view that claim as an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of the statute appropriating funds for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Respondents have not established why the discretionary Executive Branch expenditures here, which are similarly funded by no-strings, lump-sum appropriations, should be viewed any differently.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In short, this case falls outside the \"the narrow exception\" that <i>Flast</i> \"created to the general rule against taxpayer standing established in <i>Frothingham.\" </i><i>Kendrick, supra,</i> at 618, 108 S.Ct. 2562. Because the expenditures that respondents challenge were not expressly authorized or mandated by any specific congressional enactment, respondents' lawsuit is not directed at an exercise of congressional power, see <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S., at 479, 102 S.Ct. 752, and thus lacks the requisite \"logical nexus\" between taxpayer status \"and the type of legislative enactment attacked.\" <i>Flast,</i> 392 U.S., at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Respondents argue that it is \"arbitrary\" to distinguish between money spent pursuant to congressional mandate and expenditures made in the course of executive discretion, because \"the injury to taxpayers in both situations is the very injury targeted by the Establishment Clause and <i>Flast</i>\u0097 the expenditure for the support of religion of funds exacted from taxpayers.\" Brief for Respondents 13. The panel majority below agreed, based on its observation that \"there is so much that executive officials could do to promote religion in ways forbidden by the establishment clause.\" 433 F.3d, at 995.</p>\n<p>But <i>Flast</i> focused on congressional action, and we must decline this invitation to extend its holding to encompass discretionary Executive Branch expenditures. <i>Flast</i> itself distinguished the \"incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute,\" <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, and we have subsequently rejected the view that taxpayer standing \"extends to `the Government as a whole, regardless of which branch is at work in a particular instance,'\" <i>Valley Forge, supra,</i> at 484, n. 20, 102 S.Ct. 752. Moreover, we have repeatedly emphasized that the <i>Flast</i> exception has a \"narrow application in our precedent,\" <i>Cuno,</i> 547 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1865, that only \"slightly lowered\" the bar on taxpayer standing, <i>Richardson,</i> 418 U.S., at 173, 94 S.Ct. 2940, and that must be applied with \"rigor,\" <i>Valley Forge, supra,</i> at 481, 102 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n<p>It is significant that, in the four decades since its creation, the <i>Flast</i> exception has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2569</span> largely been confined to its facts. We have declined to lower the taxpayer standing bar in suits alleging violations of any constitutional provision apart from the Establishment Clause. See <i>Tilton v. Richardson,</i> 403 U.S. 672, 91 S.Ct. 2091, 29 L.Ed.2d 790 (1971) (no taxpayer standing to sue under Free Exercise Clause of First Amendment); <i>Richardson,</i> 418 U.S., at 175, 94 S.Ct. 2940 (no taxpayer standing to sue under Statement and Account Clause of Art. I); <i>Schlesinger,</i> 418 U.S., at 228, 94 S.Ct. 2925 (no taxpayer standing to sue under Incompatibility Clause of Art. I); <i>Cuno, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1865 (no taxpayer standing to sue under Commerce Clause). We have similarly refused to extend <i>Flast</i> to permit taxpayer standing for Establishment Clause challenges that do not implicate Congress' taxing and spending power. See <i>Valley Forge, supra,</i> at 479-482, 102 S.Ct. 752 (no taxpayer standing to challenge Executive Branch action taken pursuant to Property Clause of Art. IV); see also <i>District of Columbia Common Cause v. District of Columbia,</i> 858 F.2d 1, 3-4 (C.A.D.C.1988); <i>In re United States Catholic Conference,</i> 885 F.2d 1020, 1028 (C.A.2 1989). In effect, we have adopted the position set forth by Justice Powell in his concurrence in <i>Richardson</i> and have \"limit[ed] the expansion of federal taxpayer and citizen standing in the absence of specific statutory authorization to an outer boundary drawn by the <i>results</i> in <i>Flast</i> ....\" 418 U.S., at 196, 94 S.Ct. 2940.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>While respondents argue that Executive Branch expenditures in support of religion are no different from legislative extractions, <i>Flast</i> itself rejected this equivalence: \"It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute.\" 392 U.S., at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p>Because almost all Executive Branch activity is ultimately funded by some congressional appropriation, extending the <i>Flast</i> exception to purely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal action\u0097be it a conference, proclamation or speech\u0097to Establishment Clause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court. To see the wide swathe of activity that respondents' proposed rule would cover, one need look no further than the amended complaint in this action, which focuses largely on speeches and presentations made by Executive Branch officials. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Amended Complaint \u00b6 32, App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a (challenging Executive Branch officials' \"support of national and regional conferences\"); <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 33, App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a-75a (challenging content of speech by Secretary of Education); <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 35, 36, App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a (challenging content of Presidential speeches); <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 41, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a (challenging Executive Branch officials' \"public appearances\" and \"speeches\"). Such a broad reading would ignore the first prong of <i>Flast's</i> standing test, which requires \"a logical link between [taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.\" 392 U.S., at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p>It would also raise serious separation-of-powers concerns. As we have recognized, <i>Flast</i> itself gave too little weight to these concerns. By framing the standing question solely in terms of whether the dispute would be presented in an adversary context and in a form traditionally viewed as capable of judicial resolution, <i>Flast</i> \"failed to recognize that this doctrine has a separation-of-powers component, which keeps courts within certain traditional bounds vis-\u00e1-vis the other branches, concrete adverseness or not.\" <i>Lewis v. Casey,</i> 518 U.S. 343, 353, n. 3, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); see also <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S., at 471, 102 S.Ct. 752. Respondents' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2570</span> position, if adopted, would repeat and compound this mistake.</p>\n<p>The constitutional requirements for federal-court jurisdiction\u0097including the standing requirements and Article III\u0097 \"are an essential ingredient of separation and equilibration of powers.\" <i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 101, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). \"Relaxation of standing requirements is directly related to the expansion of judicial power,\" and lowering the taxpayer standing bar to permit challenges of purely executive actions \"would significantly alter the allocation of power at the national level, with a shift away from a democratic form of government.\" <i>Richardson,</i> 418 U.S., at 188, 94 S.Ct. 2940 (Powell, J., concurring). The rule respondents propose would enlist the federal courts to superintend, at the behest of any federal taxpayer, the speeches, statements, and myriad daily activities of the President, his staff, and other Executive Branch officials. This would \"be quite at odds with ... <i>Flast's</i> own promise that it would not transform federal courts into forums for taxpayers' `generalized grievances'\" about the conduct of government, <i>Cuno,</i> 547 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1865 (quoting <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 106, 88 S.Ct. 1942), and would \"open the Judiciary to an arguable charge of providing `government by injunction,'\" <i>Schlesinger,</i> 418 U.S., at 222, 94 S.Ct. 2925. It would deputize federal courts as \"`virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of Executive action,'\" and that, most emphatically, \"is not the role of the judiciary.\" <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S., at 760, 104 S.Ct. 3315 (quoting <i>Laird v. Tatum,</i> 408 U.S. 1, 15, 92 S.Ct. 2318, 33 L.Ed.2d 154 (1972)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Both the Court of Appeals and respondents implicitly recognize that unqualified federal taxpayer standing to assert Establishment Clause claims would go too far, but neither the Court of Appeals nor respondents has identified a workable limitation. The Court of Appeals, as noted, conceded only that a taxpayer would lack standing where \"the marginal or incremental cost to the taxpaying public of the alleged violation of the establishment clause\" is \"zero.\" 433 F.3d, at 995. Applying this rule, the Court of Appeals opined that a taxpayer would not have standing to challenge a President's favorable reference to religion in a State of the Union address because the costs associated with the speech \"would be no greater merely because the President had mentioned Moses rather than John Stuart Mill.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>There is reason to question whether the Court of Appeals' intended for its zero-marginal-cost test to be taken literally, because the court, without any apparent inquiry into the costs of Secretary Paige's speech, went on to agree that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge that speech. <i>Id.,</i> at 996. But if we take the Court of Appeals' test literally\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> that any marginal cost greater than zero suffices\u0097taxpayers might well have standing to challenge some (and perhaps many) speeches. As Judge Easterbrook observed: \"The total cost of presidential proclamations and speeches by Cabinet officers that touch on religion (Thanksgiving and several other holidays) surely exceeds $500,000 annually; it may cost that much to use Air Force One and send a Secret Service detail to a single speaking engagement.\" 447 F.3d, at 989-990 (concurring in denial of rehearing en banc). At a minimum, the Court of Appeals' approach (asking whether the marginal cost exceeded zero) would surely create difficult and uncomfortable line-drawing problems. Suppose that it is alleged that a speech writer or other staff member spent extra time doing research <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2571</span> for the purpose of including \"religious imagery\" in a speech. Suppose that a President or a Cabinet officer attends or speaks at a prayer breakfast and that the time spent was time that would have otherwise been spent on secular work.</p>\n<p>Respondents take a somewhat different approach, contending that their proposed expansion of <i>Flast</i> would be manageable because they would require that a challenged expenditure be \"fairly traceable to the conduct alleged to violate the Establishment Clause.\" Brief for Respondents 17. Applying this test, they argue, would \"scree[n] out ... challenge[s to] the content of one particular speech, for example the State of the Union address, as an Establishment Clause violation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 21.</p>\n<p>We find little comfort in this vague and ill-defined test. As an initial matter, respondents fail to explain why the (often substantial) costs that attend, for example, a Presidential address are any less \"traceable\" than the expenses related to the Executive Branch statements and conferences at issue here. Indeed, respondents concede that even lawsuits involving <i>de minimis</i> amounts of taxpayer money can pass their proposed \"traceability\" test. <i>Id.,</i> at 20, n. 6.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the \"traceability\" inquiry, depending on how it is framed, would appear to prove either too little or too much. If the question is whether an allegedly unconstitutional executive action can somehow be traced to taxpayer funds <i>in general,</i> the answer will always be yes: Almost all Executive Branch activities are ultimately funded by <i>some</i> congressional appropriation, whether general or specific, which is in turn financed by tax receipts. If, on the other hand, the question is whether the challenged action can be traced to the contributions of a <i>particular</i> taxpayer-plaintiff, the answer will almost always be no: As we recognized in <i>Frothingham,</i> the interest of any individual taxpayer in a particular federal expenditure \"is comparatively minute and indeterminable... and constantly changing.\" 262 U.S., at 487, 43 S.Ct. 597.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondents set out a parade of horribles that they claim could occur if <i>Flast</i> is not extended to discretionary Executive Branch expenditures. For example, they say, a federal agency could use its discretionary funds to build a house of worship or to hire clergy of one denomination and send them out to spread their faith. Or an agency could use its funds to make bulk purchases of Stars of David, crucifixes, or depictions of the star and crescent for use in its offices or for distribution to the employees or the general public. Of course, none of these things has happened, even though <i>Flast</i> has not previously been expanded in the way that respondents urge. In the unlikely event that any of these executive actions did take place, Congress could quickly step in. And respondents make no effort to show that these improbable abuses could not be challenged in federal court by plaintiffs who would possess standing based on grounds other than taxpayer standing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Over the years, <i>Flast</i> has been defended by some and criticized by others. But the present case does not require us to reconsider that precedent. The Court of Appeals did not apply <i>Flast</i>; it extended <i>Flast.</i> It is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic. That was the approach that then-Justice Rehnquist took in his opinion for the Court in <i>Valley Forge,</i> and it is the approach we take here. We do not extend <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2572</span> <i>Flast,</i> but we also do not overrule it. We leave <i>Flast</i> as we found it.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA says that we must either overrule <i>Flast</i> or extend it to the limits of its logic. His position is not \"[in]sane,\" inconsistent with the \"rule of law,\" or \"utterly meaningless.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2573-2574 (opinion concurring in judgment). But it is wrong. Justice SCALIA does not seriously dispute either (1) that <i>Flast</i> itself spoke in terms of \"legislative enactment[s]\" and \"exercises of congressional power,\" 392 U.S., at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, or (2) that in the four decades since <i>Flast</i> was decided, we have never extended its narrow exception to a purely discretionary Executive Branch expenditure. We need go no further to decide this case. Relying on the provision of the Constitution that limits our role to resolving the \"Cases\" and \"Controversies\" before us, we decide only the case at hand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, concurring.</p>\n<p>The separation-of-powers design in the Constitution is implemented, among other means, by Article III's case-or-controversy limitation and the resulting requirement of standing. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 559-560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). The Court's decision in <i>Flast v. Cohen,</i> 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), and in later cases applying it, must be interpreted as respecting separation-of-powers principles but acknowledging as well that these principles, in some cases, must accommodate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. The clause expresses the Constitution's special concern that freedom of conscience not be compromised by government taxing and spending in support of religion. In my view the result reached in <i>Flast</i> is correct and should not be called into question. For the reasons set forth by Justice ALITO, however, <i>Flast</i> should not be extended to permit taxpayer standing in the instant matter. And I join his opinion in full.</p>\n<p>Respondents' amended complaint challenged the religious nature of national and regional conferences that promoted President Bush's Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a-77a. To support the allegation respondents pointed to speeches given by the President and other executive officers, speeches with religious references. <i>Id.,</i> at 73a-76a. The complaint relies on respondents' taxpayer status as the sole basis for standing to maintain the suit but points to no specific use of Congress' taxing and spending power other than general appropriations to fund the administration of the Executive Branch. <i>Id.,</i> at 71a-73a.</p>\n<p><i>Flast</i> established a \"narrow exception\" to the rule against taxpayer standing. <i>Bowen v. Kendrick,</i> 487 U.S. 589, 618, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988). To find standing in the circumstances of this case would make the narrow exception boundless. The public events and public speeches respondents seek to call in question are part of the open discussion essential to democratic self-government. The Executive Branch should be free, as a general matter, to discover new ideas, to understand pressing public demands, and to find creative responses to address governmental concerns. The exchange of ideas between and among the State and Federal Governments and their manifold, diverse constituencies sustains a free society. Permitting any and all taxpayers to challenge the content of these prototypical executive operations and dialogues would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2573</span> lead to judicial intervention so far exceeding traditional boundaries on the Judiciary that there would arise a real danger of judicial oversight of executive duties. The burden of discovery to ascertain if relief is justified in these potentially innumerable cases would risk altering the free exchange of ideas and information. And were this constant supervision to take place the courts would soon assume the role of speech editors for communications issued by executive officials and event planners for meetings they hold.</p>\n<p>The courts must be reluctant to expand their authority by requiring intrusive and unremitting judicial management of the way the Executive Branch performs its duties. The Court has refused to establish a constitutional rule that would require or allow \"permanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental operations to a degree inconsistent with sound principles of federalism and the separation of powers.\" <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 1961, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006); see also <i>Cheney v. United States Dist. Court for D.C.,</i> 542 U.S. 367, 382, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004) (noting that \"separation-of-powers considerations should inform a court of appeals' evaluation of a mandamus petition involving the President or the Vice President\" and that \"mandamus standards are broad enough... to prevent a lower court from interfering with a coequal branch's ability to discharge its constitutional responsibilities\"). In the Article III context the Court explained that concerns based on separation of powers \"counsel[ed] against recognizing standing in a case brought ... to seek a restructuring of the apparatus established by the Executive Branch to fulfill its legal duties.\" <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. 737, 761, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).</p>\n<p>The same principle applies here. The Court should not authorize the constant intrusion upon the executive realm that would result from granting taxpayer standing in the instant case. As JUSTICE ALITO explains in detail, the Court's precedents do not require it to do so. The separation-of-powers concerns implicated by intrusive judicial regulation of day-to-day executive operations reinforce his interpretation of <i>Flast's</i> framework. Cf. <i>Allen, supra,</i> at 761, n. 26, 104 S.Ct. 3315 (relying \"on separation of powers principles to interpret the `fairly traceable' component of the standing requirement\").</p>\n<p>It must be remembered that, even where parties have no standing to sue, members of the Legislative and Executive Branches are not excused from making constitutional determinations in the regular course of their duties. Government officials must make a conscious decision to obey the Constitution whether or not their acts can be challenged in a court of law and then must conform their actions to these principled determinations.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Today's opinion is, in one significant respect, entirely consistent with our previous cases addressing taxpayer standing to raise Establishment Clause challenges to government expenditures. Unfortunately, the consistency lies in the creation of utterly meaningless distinctions which separate the case at hand from the precedents that have come out differently, but which cannot possibly be (in any sane world) the reason it comes out differently. If this Court is to decide cases by rule of law rather than show of hands, we must surrender to logic and choose sides: Either <i>Flast v. Cohen,</i> 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), should be applied to (at a minimum) <i>all</i> challenges to the governmental expenditure of general tax revenues <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2574</span> in a manner alleged to violate a constitutional provision specifically limiting the taxing and spending power, or <i>Flast</i> should be repudiated. For me, the choice is easy. <i>Flast</i> is wholly irreconcilable with the Article III restrictions on federal-court jurisdiction that this Court has repeatedly confirmed are embodied in the doctrine of standing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>There is a simple reason why our taxpayer-standing cases involving Establishment Clause challenges to government expenditures are notoriously inconsistent: We have inconsistently described the first element of the \"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,\" which minimum consists of (1) a \"concrete and particularized\" \"`injury in fact'\" that is (2) fairly traceable to the defendant's alleged unlawful conduct and (3) likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. See <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). We have alternately relied on two entirely distinct conceptions of injury in fact, which for convenience I will call \"Wallet Injury\" and \"Psychic Injury.\"</p>\n<p>Wallet Injury is the type of concrete and particularized injury one would expect to be asserted in a <i>taxpayer</i> suit, namely, a claim that the plaintiff's tax liability is higher than it would be, but for the allegedly unlawful government action. The stumbling block for suits challenging government expenditures based on this conventional type of injury is quite predictable. The plaintiff cannot satisfy the traceability and redressability prongs of standing. It is uncertain what the plaintiff's tax bill would have been had the allegedly forbidden expenditure not been made, and it is even more speculative whether the government will, in response to an adverse court decision, lower taxes rather than spend the funds in some other manner.</p>\n<p>Psychic Injury, on the other hand, has nothing to do with the plaintiff's tax liability. Instead, the injury consists of the taxpayer's <i>mental displeasure</i> that money extracted from him is being spent in an unlawful manner. This shift in focus eliminates traceability and redressability problems. Psychic Injury is directly traceable to the improper <i>use</i> of taxpayer funds, and it is redressed when the improper use is enjoined, regardless of whether that injunction affects the taxpayer's purse. <i>Flast</i> and the cases following its teaching have invoked a peculiarly restricted version of Psychic Injury, permitting taxpayer displeasure over unconstitutional spending to support standing <i>only if</i> the constitutional provision allegedly violated is a specific limitation on the taxing and spending power. Restricted or not, this conceptualizing of injury in fact in purely mental terms conflicts squarely with the familiar proposition that a plaintiff lacks a concrete and particularized injury when his only complaint is the generalized grievance that the law is being violated. As we reaffirmed unanimously just this Term: \"`We have consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about government\u0097claiming only harm to his and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large\u0097does not state an Article III case or controversy.'\" <i>Lance v. Coffman,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1194, 1196, 167 L.Ed.2d 29 (2007) <i>(per curiam)</i> (quoting <i>Lujan, supra,</i> at 573-574, 112 S.Ct. 2130).</p>\n<p>As the following review of our cases demonstrates, we initially denied taxpayer standing based on Wallet Injury, but then <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2575</span> found standing in some later cases based on the limited version of Psychic Injury described above. The basic logical flaw in our cases is thus twofold: We have never explained why Psychic Injury was insufficient in the cases in which standing was denied, and we have never explained why Psychic Injury, however limited, is cognizable under Article III.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Two pre-<i>Flast</i> cases are of critical importance. In <i>Frothingham v. Mellon,</i> decided with <i>Massachusetts v. Mellon,</i> 262 U.S. 447, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923), the taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of the Maternity Act of 1921, alleging in part that the federal funding provided by the Act was not authorized by any provision of the Constitution. See <i>id.,</i> at 476-477, 43 S.Ct. 597 (argument for Frothingham), 479-480 (opinion of the Court). The Court held that the taxpayer lacked standing. After emphasizing that \"the effect upon future taxation ... of any payment out of [Treasury] funds\" was \"remote, fluctuating and uncertain,\" <i>Frothingham,</i> 262 U.S., at 487, 43 S.Ct. 597, the Court concluded that \"[t]he party who invokes the power [of judicial review] must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally,\" <i>id.,</i> at 488, 43 S.Ct. 597. The Court was thus describing the traceability and redressability problems with Wallet Injury, and rejecting Psychic Injury as a generalized grievance rather than concrete and particularized harm.</p>\n<p>The second significant pre-<i>Flast</i> case is <i>Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne,</i> 342 U.S. 429, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952). There the taxpayers challenged under the Establishment Clause a state law requiring public-school teachers to read the Bible at the beginning of each school day. <i>Id.,</i> at 430, 433, 72 S.Ct. 394.<sup>[1]</sup> Relying extensively on <i>Frothingham,</i> the Court denied standing. After first emphasizing that there was no allegation that the Bible reading increased the plaintiffs' taxes or the cost of running the schools, 342 U.S., at 433, 72 S.Ct. 394, and then reaffirming that taxpayers must allege more than an indefinite injury suffered in common with people generally, <i>id.,</i> at 434, 72 S.Ct. 394, the Court concluded that the \"grievance which [the plaintiffs] sought to litigate here is not a direct dollars-and-cents injury but is a religious difference,\" <i>ibid.</i> In addition to reiterating <i>Frothingham's</i> description of the unavoidable obstacles to recovery under a taxpayer theory of Wallet Injury, <i>Doremus</i> rejected Psychic Injury in unmistakable terms. The opinion's deprecation of a mere \"religious difference,\" in contrast to a real \"dollars-and-cents injury,\" can only be understood as a flat denial of standing supported only by taxpayer disapproval of the unconstitutional use of tax funds. If the Court had thought that Psychic Injury was a permissible basis for standing, it should have sufficed (as the dissenting Justices in <i>Doremus</i> suggested, see 342 U.S., at 435, 72 S.Ct. 394 (opinion of Douglas, J.)) that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2576</span> public employees were being paid in part to violate the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Sixteen years after <i>Doremus,</i> the Court took a pivotal turn. In <i>Flast v. Cohen,</i> 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), taxpayers challenged the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, alleging that funds expended pursuant to the Act were being used to support parochial schools. <i>Id.,</i> at 85-87, 88 S.Ct. 1942. They argued that either the Act itself proscribed such expenditures or that the Act violated the Establishment Clause. <i>Id.,</i> at 87, 90, 88 S.Ct. 1942. The Court held that the taxpayers had standing. Purportedly in order to determine whether taxpayers have the \"personal stake and interest\" necessary to satisfy Article III, a two-pronged nexus test was invented. <i>Id.,</i> at 101-102, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p>The first prong required the taxpayer to \"establish a logical link between [taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942. The Court described what that meant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[A] taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, \u00a7 8, of the Constitution. It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute. This requirement is consistent with the limitation imposed upon state-taxpayer standing in federal courts in <i>Doremus</i>....\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second prong required the taxpayer to \"establish a nexus between [taxpayer] status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Court elaborated that this required \"the taxpayer [to] show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art. I, \u00a7 8.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 102-103, 88 S.Ct. 1942. The Court held that the Establishment Clause was the type of specific limitation on the taxing and spending power that it had in mind because \"one of the specific evils feared by\" the Framers of that Clause was that the taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion over another or to support religion generally. <i>Id.,</i> at 103-104, 88 S.Ct. 1942 (relying exclusively upon Madison's famous Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments).</p>\n<p>Because both prongs of its newly minted two-part test were satisfied, <i>Flast</i> held that the taxpayers had standing. Wallet Injury could not possibly have been the basis for this conclusion, since the taxpayers in <i>Flast</i> were no more able to prove that success on the merits would reduce their tax burden than was the taxpayer in <i>Frothingham.</i> Thus, <i>Flast</i> relied on Psychic Injury to support standing, describing the \"injury\" as the taxpayer's allegation that \"his tax money is being extracted and spent in violation of specific constitutional protections against such abuses of legislative power.\" 392 U.S., at 106, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p>But that created a problem: If the taxpayers in <i>Flast</i> had standing based on Psychic Injury, and without regard to the effect of the litigation on their ultimate tax liability, why did not the taxpayers in <i>Doremus</i> and <i>Frothingham</i> have standing on a similar basis? Enter the magical two-pronged nexus test. It has often been pointed out, and never refuted, that the criteria in <i>Flast's</i> two-part test are <i>entirely unrelated</i> to the purported goal of ensuring that the plaintiff has a sufficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2577</span> \"stake in the outcome of the controversy.\" See <i>Flast,</i> 392 U.S., at 121-124, 88 S.Ct. 1942 (Harlan, J., dissenting); see also <i>id.,</i> at 107, 88 S.Ct. 1942 (Douglas, J., concurring); <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 418 U.S. 166, 183, 94 S.Ct. 2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring). In truth, the test was designed for a quite different goal. Each prong was meant to disqualify from standing one of the two prior cases that would otherwise contradict the holding of <i>Flast.</i> The first prong distinguished <i>Doremus</i> as involving a challenge to an \"incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute,\" rather than a challenge to a taxing and spending statute. See 392 U.S., at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942. Did the Court proffer any reason why a taxpayer's Psychic Injury is less concrete and particularized, traceable, or redressable when the challenged expenditures are incidental to an essentially regulatory statute (whatever that means)? Not at all. <i>Doremus</i> had to be evaded, and so it was. In reality, of course, there is simply no material difference between <i>Flast</i> and <i>Doremus</i> as far as Psychic Injury is concerned: If taxpayers upset with the government's giving money to parochial schools had standing to sue, so should the taxpayers who disapproved of the government's paying public-school teachers to read the Bible.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Flast's</i> dispatching of <i>Frothingham</i> via the second prong of the nexus test was only marginally less disingenuous. Not only does the relationship of the allegedly violated provision to the taxing and spending power have no bearing upon the concreteness or particularity of the Psychic Injury, see Part III, <i>infra,</i> but the existence of that relationship does not even genuinely distinguish <i>Flast</i> from <i>Frothingham.</i> It is impossible to maintain that the Establishment Clause is a more direct limitation on the taxing and spending power than the constitutional limitation invoked in <i>Frothingham, which is contained within the very provision creating the power to tax and spend.</i> Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1, provides: \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes ..., to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence <i>and general Welfare</i> of the United States.\" (Emphasis added.) Though unmentioned in <i>Flast,</i> it was precisely this limitation upon the permissible purposes of taxing and spending upon which Mrs. Frothingham relied. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Appellant in <i>Frothingham,</i> O.T.1922, No. 962, p. 68 (\"[T]he words `provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States' are used <i>as limitations on the taxing power</i>\"); <i>id.,</i> at 26-81 (discussing the general welfare limitation at length).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Coherence and candor have fared no better in our later taxpayer-standing cases. The three of them containing lengthy discussion of the Establishment Clause warrant analysis.</p>\n<p><i>Flast</i> was dismissively and unpersuasively distinguished just 13 years later in <i>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2578</span> <i>United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</i> 454 U.S. 464, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982). The taxpayers there challenged the decision of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to give a 77-acre tract of Government property, worth over half a million dollars, to a religious organization. <i>Id.,</i> at 468, 102 S.Ct. 752. The Court, adhering to the strict letter of <i>Flast's</i> two-pronged nexus test, held that the taxpayers lacked standing. <i>Flast's</i> first prong was not satisfied: Rather than challenging a congressional taxing and spending statute, the plaintiffs were attacking an agency decision to transfer federal property pursuant to Congress's power under the Property Clause, Art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2. 454 U.S., at 479-480, 102 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n<p>In distinguishing between the Spending Clause and the Property Clause, <i>Valley Forge</i> achieved the seemingly impossible: It surpassed the high bar for irrationality set by <i>Flast's</i> distinguishing of <i>Doremus</i> and <i>Frothingham.</i> Like the dissenters in <i>Valley Forge,</i> see 454 U.S., at 511-512, 102 S.Ct. 752 (opinion of Brennan, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 513-514, 102 S.Ct. 752 (opinion of STEVENS, J.), I cannot fathom why Article III standing should turn on whether the government enables a religious organization to obtain real estate by giving it a check drawn from general tax revenues or instead by buying the property itself and then transferring title.</p>\n<p>While <i>Valley Forge's</i> application of the first prong to distinguish <i>Flast</i> was unpersuasive, the Court was at least not trying to hide the ball. Its holding was forthrightly based on a resounding rejection of the very concept of Psychic Injury:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Plaintiffs] fail to identify any personal injury suffered by them as a consequence of the alleged constitutional error, other than the psychological consequence presumably produced by observation of conduct with which one disagrees. That is not an injury sufficient to confer standing under Art. III, even though the disagreement is phrased in constitutional terms. It is evident that respondents are firmly committed to the constitutional principle of separation of church and State, but standing is not measured by the intensity of the litigant's interest or the fervor of his advocacy.\" 454 U.S., at 485-486, 102 S.Ct. 752 (emphasis omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, in keeping with what was to become the shameful tradition of our taxpayer-standing cases, the Court's candor about the inadequacy of Psychic Injury was combined with a notable silence as to why <i>Flast</i> itself was not doomed.</p>\n<p>A mere six years later, <i>Flast</i> was resuscitated in <i>Bowen v. Kendrick,</i> 487 U.S. 589, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988). The taxpayers there brought facial and as-applied Establishment Clause challenges to the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA), which was a congressional scheme that provided grants to public or nonprofit private organizations to combat premarital adolescent pregnancy and sex. <i>Id.,</i> at 593, 108 S.Ct. 2562. The as-applied challenge focused on whether particular grantees selected by the Secretary of Health and Human Services were constitutionally permissible recipients. <i>Id.,</i> at 620-622, 108 S.Ct. 2562. The Solicitor General argued that, under <i>Valley Forge's</i> application of <i>Flast's</i> first prong, the taxpayers lacked standing for their as-applied claim because that claim was really a challenge to executive decisionmaking, not to Congress's exercise of its taxing and spending power. 487 U.S., at 618-619, 108 S.Ct. 2562. The Court rejected this contention, holding that the taxpayers' as-applied claim was still a challenge to Congress's taxing and spending power even <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2579</span> though disbursement of the funds authorized by Congress had been administered by the Secretary. <i>Id.,</i> at 619, 108 S.Ct. 2562.</p>\n<p><i>Kendrick,</i> like <i>Flast</i> before it, was obviously based on Psychic Injury: The taxpayers could not possibly make, and did not attempt to make, the showing required for Wallet Injury. But by relying on Psychic Injury, <i>Kendrick</i> perfectly revealed the incompatibility of that concept with the outcome in <i>Doremus.</i> Just as <i>Kendrick</i> did not care whether the appropriated funds would have been spent anyway \u0097 given to a different, permissible recipient \u0097 so also <i>Doremus</i> should not have cared that the teachers would likely receive the same salary once their classroom activities were limited to secular conduct. <i>Flast</i> and <i>Kendrick's</i> acceptance of Psychic Injury is fundamentally at odds with <i>Frothingham, Doremus,</i> and <i>Valley Forge.</i></p>\n<p>Which brings me to the final case worthy of mention. Last Term, in <i>DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno,</i> 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1854, 164 L.Ed.2d 589 (2006), we concisely confirmed that <i>Flast</i> was based on Psychic Injury. The taxpayers in that case sought to rely on <i>Flast</i> to raise a Commerce Clause challenge to a state franchise tax credit. 547 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1864. In rejecting the analogy and denying standing, we described <i>Flast</i> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Court ... understood the `injury' alleged in Establishment Clause challenges to federal spending to be the very `extract[ion] and spen[ding]' of `tax money' in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff. And an injunction against the spending would of course redress <i>that</i> injury, regardless of whether lawmakers would dispose of the savings in a way that would benefit the taxpayer-plaintiffs personally.\" 547 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1865 (citation omitted; some alterations in original).</blockquote>\n<p>What <i>Cuno</i>'s conceptualization of <i>Flast</i> reveals is that there are only two logical routes available to this Court. We must initially decide whether Psychic Injury is consistent with Article III. If it is, we should apply <i>Flast</i> to <i>all</i> challenges to government expenditures in violation of constitutional provisions that specifically limit the taxing and spending power; if it is not, we should overturn <i>Flast.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The plurality today avails itself of neither principled option. Instead, essentially accepting the Solicitor General's primary submission, it limits <i>Flast</i> to challenges to expenditures that are \"expressly authorized or mandated by ... specific congressional enactment.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2568. It offers no intellectual justification for this limitation, except that \"[i]t is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2571. That is true enough, but since courts purport to be engaged in <i>reasoned</i> decisionmaking, it is <i>only</i> true when (1) the precedent's logic is seen to require narrowing or readjustment in light of relevant distinctions that the new fact situation brings to the fore; or (2) its logic is fundamentally flawed, and so deserves to be limited to the facts that begot it. Today's plurality claims neither of these justifications. As to the first, the plurality offers no explanation of why the factual differences between this case and <i>Flast</i> are <i>material.</i> It virtually admits that express congressional allocation <i>vel non</i> has nothing to do with whether the plaintiffs have alleged an injury in fact that is fairly traceable and likely to be redressed. See <i>ante,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2580</span> 2568-2569. As the dissent correctly contends and I shall not belabor, see <i>post,</i> at 2585-2586 (opinion of SOUTER, J.), <i>Flast</i> is <i>indistinguishable</i> from this case for purposes of Article III. Whether the challenged government expenditure is expressly allocated by a specific congressional enactment <i>has absolutely no relevance</i> to the Article III criteria of injury in fact, traceability, and redressability.</p>\n<p>Yet the plurality is also unwilling to acknowledge that the logic of <i>Flast</i> (its Psychic Injury rationale) is simply wrong, and <i>for that reason</i> should not be extended to other cases. Despite the lack of acknowledgment, however, that is the only plausible explanation for the plurality's indifference to whether the \"distinguishing\" fact is legally material, and for its determination to limit <i>Flast</i> to its \"`<i>resul[t],'\" ante,</i> at 2568-2569.<sup>[3]</sup> Why, then, pick a distinguishing fact that may breathe life into <i>Flast</i> in future cases, preserving the disreputable disarray of our Establishment Clause standing jurisprudence? Why not hold that only taxpayers raising Establishment Clause challenges to expenditures pursuant to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 have standing? That, I suppose, would be too obvious a repudiation of <i>Flast,</i> and thus an impediment to the plurality's pose of minimalism.</p>\n<p>Because the express-allocation line has no mooring to our tripartite test for Article III standing, it invites demonstrably absurd results. For example, the plurality would deny standing to a taxpayer challenging the President's disbursement to a religious organization of a discrete appropriation that Congress had not explicitly allocated to that purpose, even if everyone knew that Congress and the President had informally negotiated that the entire sum would be spent in that precise manner. See <i>ante,</i> at 2568, n. 7 (holding that nonstatutory earmarks are insufficient to satisfy the express-allocation requirement). And taxpayers should lack standing to bring Establishment Clause challenges to the Executive Branch's use of appropriated funds when those expenditures have the <i>added vice</i> of violating congressional restrictions. If, for example, Congress instructs the President to disburse grants to hospitals that he deems worthy, and the President instead gives all of the money to the Catholic Church, \"[t]he link between congressional action and constitutional violation that supported taxpayer standing in <i>Flast</i> [would be] missing.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2565-2566. Indeed, taking the plurality at its word, Congress could insulate the President from <i>all Flast</i>-based suits by codifying the truism that no appropriation can be spent by the Executive Branch in a manner that violates the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p>Any last pretense of minimalism\u0097of adhering to prior law but merely declining to \"extend\" it\u0097is swept away by the fact that the Court's holding flatly contradicts <i>Kendrick.</i> The whole point of the as-applied challenge in <i>Kendrick</i> was that the Secretary, not Congress, had <i>chosen</i> inappropriate grant recipients. 487 U.S., at 620-622, 108 S.Ct. 2562. Both <i>Kendrick</i> and this case equally involve, in the relevant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2581</span> sense, attacks on executive discretion rather than congressional decision: Congress generally authorized the spending of tax funds for certain purposes but did not explicitly mandate that they be spent in the <i>unconstitutional</i> manner challenged by the taxpayers. I thus share the dissent's bewilderment, see <i>post,</i> at 2586-2587 (opinion of SOUTER, J.), as to why the plurality fixates on the amount of <i>additional</i> discretion the Executive Branch enjoys under the law beyond the only discretion relevant to the Establishment Clause issue: whether to spend taxpayer funds for a purpose that is unconstitutional. See <i>ante,</i> at 2572 (focusing on whether the case involves \"a <i>purely</i> discretionary Executive Branch expenditure\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>While I have been critical of the Members of the plurality, I by no means wish to give the impression that respondents' legal position is any more coherent. Respondents argue that <i>Flast</i> did not turn on whether Congress has expressly allocated the funds to the allegedly unconstitutional use, and their case plainly rests on Psychic Injury. They repeatedly emphasize that the injury in <i>Flast</i> was merely the governmental extraction and spending of tax money in aid of religion. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondents 28. Respondents refuse to admit that their argument logically implies, for the reasons already discussed, that <i>every</i> expenditure of tax revenues that is alleged to violate the Establishment Clause is subject to suit under <i>Flast.</i></p>\n<p>Of course, such a concession would run headlong into the denial of standing in <i>Doremus.</i> Respondents' only answer to <i>Doremus</i> is the cryptic assertion that the injury there was not fairly traceable to the unconstitutional conduct. Brief for Respondents 21, and n. 7. This makes no sense. On <i>Flast's</i> theory of Psychic Injury, the injury in <i>Doremus</i> was perfectly traceable and not in any way attenuated. It consisted of the psychic frustration that tax funds were being used in violation of the Establishment Clause, which was directly caused by the paying of teachers to read the Bible, and which would have been remedied by prohibition of that expenditure.<sup>[4]</sup> The hollowness of respondents' traceability argument is perhaps best demonstrated by their counsel's game submission at oral argument that there would be standing to challenge the hiring of a single Secret Service agent who guarded the President during religious trips, but no standing if those responsibilities (and the corresponding taxpayer-funded compensation) were spread out over the entire Secret Service protective detail. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38-39.</p>\n<p>The logical consequence of respondents' position finds no support in this Court's precedents or our Nation's history. Any taxpayer would be able to sue whenever tax funds were used in alleged violation of the Establishment Clause. So, for example, any taxpayer could challenge the fact that the Marshal of our Court is paid, in part, to call the courtroom to order by proclaiming \"God Save the United States and this Honorable Court.\" As much as respondents wish to deny that this is what <i>Flast</i> logically entails, it blinks reality to conclude otherwise. If respondents are to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2582</span> prevail, they must endorse a future in which ideologically motivated taxpayers could \"roam the country in search of governmental wrongdoing and ... reveal their discoveries in federal court,\" transforming those courts into \"ombudsmen of the general welfare\" with respect to Establishment Clause issues. <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S., at 487, 102 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, the arguments by the parties in this case and the opinions of my colleagues serve only to confirm that <i>Flast's</i> adoption of Psychic Injury has to be addressed head-on. Minimalism is an admirable judicial trait, but not when it comes at the cost of meaningless and disingenuous distinctions that hold the sure promise of engendering further meaningless and disingenuous distinctions in the future. The rule of law is ill served by forcing lawyers and judges to make arguments that deaden the soul of the law, which is logic and reason. Either <i>Flast</i> was correct, and must be accorded the wide application that it logically dictates, or it was not, and must be abandoned in its entirety. I turn, finally, to that question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Is a taxpayer's purely psychological displeasure that his funds are being spent in an allegedly unlawful manner ever sufficiently concrete and particularized to support Article III standing? The answer is plainly no.</p>\n<p>As I noted at the outset, <i>Lujan</i> explained that the \"consisten[t]\" view of this Court has been that \"a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about government\u0097claiming only harm to his and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large\u0097does not state an Article III case or controversy.\" 504 U.S., at 573-574, 112 S.Ct. 2130. As evidence of the consistency with which we have affirmed that understanding, <i>Lujan</i> relied on the reasoning in <i>Frothingham,</i> and in several other cases, including <i>Ex parte Levitt,</i> 302 U.S. 633, 58 S.Ct. 1, 82 L.Ed. 493 (1937) (dismissing suit challenging Justice Black's appointment to this Court in alleged violation of the Ineligibility Clause, Art. I, \u00a7 6, cl. 2), <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 418 U.S. 166, 94 S.Ct. 2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974) (denying standing to challenge the Government's failure to disclose the CIA's expenditures in alleged violation of the Accounts Clause, Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7), and <i>Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,</i> 418 U.S. 208, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974) (rejecting challenge to Members of Congress holding commissions in the military Reserves in alleged violation of the Incompatibility Clause, Art. I, \u00a7 6, cl. 2). See 504 U.S., at 573-577, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Just this Term, relying on precisely the same cases and the same reasoning, we held unanimously that suits raising only generalized grievances do not satisfy Article III's requirement that the injury in fact be concrete and particularized. See <i>Lance,</i> 549 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1196-1197.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Nor does <i>Flast</i>'s limitation on Psychic Injury\u0097the limitation that it suffices only when the two-pronged \"nexus\" test is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2583</span> met\u0097cure the Article III deficiency. The fact that it is the alleged violation of a specific constitutional limit on the taxing and spending power that produces the tax-payer's mental angst does not change the fundamental flaw. It remains the case that the taxpayer seeks \"relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large.\" <i>Lujan, supra,</i> at 573-574, 112 S.Ct. 2130. And it is of no conceivable relevance to this issue whether the Establishment Clause was originally conceived of as a specific limitation on the taxing and spending power. Madison's Remonstrance has nothing whatever to say on the question whether suits alleging violations of that limitation are anything other than the generalized grievances that federal courts had always been barred from considering before <i>Flast. Flast</i> was forced to rely on the slim reed of the Remonstrance since there was no better support for its novel conclusion, in 1968, that violation of the Establishment Clause, unique among the provisions of our law, had always inflicted a personalized Psychic Injury upon all taxpayers that federal courts had the power to remedy.</p>\n<p>Moreover, <i>Flast</i> is damaged goods, not only because its fanciful two-pronged \"nexus\" test has been demonstrated to be irrelevant to the test's supposed objective, but also because its cavalier treatment of the standing requirement rested upon a fundamental underestimation of that requirement's importance. <i>Flast</i> was explicitly and erroneously premised on the idea that Article III standing does not perform a crucial separation-of-powers function:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The question whether a particular person is a proper party to maintain the action does not, by its own force, raise separation of powers problems related to improper judicial interference in areas committed to other branches of the Federal Government. Such problems arise, if at all, only from the substantive issues the individual seeks to have adjudicated. Thus, in terms of Article III limitations on federal court jurisdiction, the question of standing is related only to whether the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution.\" 392 U.S., at 100-101, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</blockquote>\n<p>A perceptive Frenchman, visiting the United States some 135 years before Chief Justice Warren wrote these words, perceived that they were false.</p>\n<blockquote>\"It is true that ... judicial censure, exercised by the courts on legislation, cannot extend without distinction to all laws, <i>for there are some of them that can never give rise to the sort of clearly formulated dispute that one calls a case.</i>\" A. de Tocqueville, Democracy in America 97 (H. Mansfield &amp; D. Winthrop transls. and eds.2000) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p><i>Flast's</i> crabbed (and judge-empowering) understanding of the role Article III standing plays in preserving our system of separated powers has been repudiated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"To permit a complainant who has no concrete injury to require a court to rule on important constitutional issues in the abstract would create the potential for abuse of the judicial process, distort the role of the Judiciary in its relationship to the Executive and the Legislature and open the Judiciary to an arguable charge of providing `government by injunction.'\" <i>Schlesinger, supra,</i> at 222, 94 S.Ct. 2925.</blockquote>\n<p>See also <i>Richardson,</i> 418 U.S., at 179-180, 94 S.Ct. 2940; <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S., at 474, 102 S.Ct. 752; <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S., at 576-577, 112 S.Ct. 2130. We twice have noted explicitly that <i>Flast</i> failed to recognize the vital separation-of-powers aspect <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2584</span> of Article III standing. See <i>Spencer v. Kemna,</i> 523 U.S. 1, 11-12, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <i>Lewis v. Casey,</i> 518 U.S. 343, 353, n. 3, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). And once a proper understanding of the relationship of standing to the separation of powers is brought to bear, Psychic Injury, even as limited in <i>Flast,</i> is revealed for what it is: a contradiction of the basic propositions that the function of the judicial power \"is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals,\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 170, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), and that generalized grievances affecting the public at large have their remedy in the political process.</p>\n<p>Overruling prior precedents, even precedents as disreputable as <i>Flast,</i> is nevertheless a serious undertaking, and I understand the impulse to take a minimalist approach. But laying just claim to be honoring <i>stare decisis</i> requires more than beating <i>Flast</i> to a pulp and then sending it out to the lower courts weakened, denigrated, more incomprehensible than ever, and yet somehow technically alive. Even before the addition of the new meaningless distinction devised by today's plurality, taxpayer standing in Establishment Clause cases has been a game of chance. In the proceedings below, well-respected federal judges declined to hear this case en banc, not because they thought the issue unimportant or the panel decision correct, but simply because they found our cases so lawless that there was no point in, quite literally, second-guessing the panel. See <i>Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc. v. Chao,</i> 447 F.3d 988 (C.A.7 2006) (Flaum, C. J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc); <i>id.,</i> at 989-990 (Easterbrook, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (describing our cases as \"arbitrary,\" \"illogical,\" and lacking in \"comprehensiveness and rationality\"). We had an opportunity today to erase this blot on our jurisprudence, but instead have simply smudged it.</p>\n<p>My call for the imposition of logic and order upon this chaotic set of precedents will perhaps be met with the snappy epigram that \"[t]he life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.\" O. Holmes, The Common Law 1 (1881). But what experience has shown is that <i>Flast's</i> lack of a logical theoretical underpinning has rendered our taxpayer-standing doctrine such a jurisprudential disaster that our appellate judges do not know what to make of it. And of course the case has engendered no reliance interests, not only because one does not arrange his affairs with an eye to standing, but also because there is no relying on the random and irrational. I can think of few cases less warranting of <i>stare decisis</i> respect. It is time\u0097it is past time\u0097to call an end. <i>Flast</i> should be overruled.</p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice GINSBURG, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p><i>Flast v. Cohen,</i> 392 U.S. 83, 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), held that plaintiffs with an Establishment Clause claim could \"demonstrate the necessary stake as taxpayers in the outcome of the litigation to satisfy Article III requirements.\" Here, the controlling, plurality opinion declares that <i>Flast</i> does not apply, but a search of that opinion for a suggestion that these taxpayers have any less stake in the outcome than the taxpayers in <i>Flast</i> will come up empty: the plurality makes no such finding, nor could it. Instead, the controlling opinion closes the door on these taxpayers because the Executive Branch, and not the Legislative Branch, caused their injury. I see no basis for this distinction in either logic or precedent, and respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>We held in <i>Flast,</i> and repeated just last Term, that the \"`injury' alleged in Establishment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2585</span> Clause challenges to federal spending\" is \"the very `extract[ion] and spen[ding]' of `tax money' in aid of religion.\" <i>DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno,</i> 547 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 1854, 1865, 164 L.Ed.2d 589 (2006) (quoting <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 106, 88 S.Ct. 1942; alterations in original). As the Court said in <i>Flast,</i> the importance of that type of injury has deep historical roots going back to the ideal of religious liberty in James Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, that the government in a free society may not \"force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment\" of religion. 2 Writings of James Madison 183, 186 (G. Hunt ed.1901) (hereinafter Madison), quoted in <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 103, 88 S.Ct. 1942. Madison thus translated into practical terms the right of conscience described when he wrote that \"[t]he Religion... of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate.\" Madison 184; see also <i>Zelman v. Simmons-Harris,</i> 536 U.S. 639, 711, n. 22, 122 S.Ct. 2460, 153 L.Ed.2d 604 (2002) (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (\"As a historical matter, the protection of liberty of conscience may well have been the central objective served by the Establishment Clause\"); <i>Locke v. Davey,</i> 540 U.S. 712, 722, 124 S.Ct. 1307, 158 L.Ed.2d 1 (2004) (\"Since the founding of our country, there have been popular uprisings against procuring taxpayer funds to support church leaders, which was one of the hallmarks of an `established' religion\"); N. Feldman, Divided By God: America's Church-State Problem\u0097And What We Should Do About It 48 (2005) (\"The advocates of a constitutional ban on establishment were concerned about paying taxes to support religious purposes that their consciences told them not to support\").</p>\n<p>The right of conscience and the expenditure of an identifiable three pence raised by taxes for the support of a religious cause are therefore not to be split off from one another. The three pence implicates the conscience, and the injury from Government expenditures on religion is not accurately classified with the \"Psychic Injury\" that results whenever a congressional appropriation or executive expenditure raises hackles of disagreement with the policy supported, see <i>ante,</i> at 2577 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Justice Stewart recognized this in his concurring opinion in <i>Flast,</i> when he said that \"every taxpayer can claim a personal constitutional right not to be taxed for the support of a religious institution,\" and thus distinguished the case from one in which a taxpayer sought only to air a generalized grievance in federal court. 392 U.S., at 114, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p>Here, there is no dispute that taxpayer money in identifiable amounts is funding conferences, and these are alleged to have the purpose of promoting religion. Cf. <i>Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne,</i> 342 U.S. 429, 434, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952). The taxpayers therefore seek not to \"extend\" <i>Flast, ante,</i> at 2571-2572 (plurality opinion), but merely to apply it. When executive agencies spend identifiable sums of tax money for religious purposes, no less than when Congress authorizes the same thing, taxpayers suffer injury. And once we recognize the injury as sufficient for Article III, there can be no serious question about the other elements of the standing enquiry: the injury is indisputably \"traceable\" to the spending, and \"likely to be redressed by\" an injunction prohibiting it. <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984); see also <i>Cuno, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1865 (\"[A]n injunction against the spending would of course redress <i>that</i> injury\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2586</span> The plurality points to the separation of powers to explain its distinction between legislative and executive spending decisions, see <i>ante,</i> at 2569-2570, but there is no difference on that point of view between a Judicial Branch review of an executive decision and a judicial evaluation of a congressional one. We owe respect to each of the other branches, no more to the former than to the latter, and no one has suggested that the Establishment Clause lacks applicability to executive uses of money. It would surely violate the Establishment Clause for the Department of Health and Human Services to draw on a general appropriation to build a chapel for weekly church services (no less than if a statute required it), and for good reason: if the Executive could accomplish through the exercise of discretion exactly what Congress cannot do through legislation, Establishment Clause protection would melt away.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>So in <i>Bowen v. Kendrick,</i> 487 U.S. 589, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988), we recognized the equivalence between a challenge to a congressional spending bill and a claim that the Executive Branch was spending an appropriation, each in violation of the Establishment Clause. We held that the \"claim that ... funds [were] being used improperly by individual grantees [was no] less a challenge to congressional taxing and spending power simply because the funding authorized by Congress has flowed through and been administered by the Secretary,\" and we added that \"we have not questioned the standing of taxpayer plaintiffs to raise Establishment Clause challenges, even when their claims raised questions about the administratively made grants.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 619, 108 S.Ct. 2562.</p>\n<p>The plurality points out that the statute in <i>Bowen</i> \"expressly authorized and appropriated specific funds for grantmaking\" and \"expressly contemplated that some of those moneys might go to projects involving religious groups.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2567. That is all true, but there is no reason to think it should matter, and every indication in <i>Bowen</i> that it did not. In <i>Bowen</i> we already had found the statute valid on its face before we turned to the taxpayers' as-applied challenge, see 487 U.S., at 618, 108 S.Ct. 2562, so the case cannot be read to hold that taxpayers have standing only to claim that congressional action, but not its implementation, violates the Establishment Clause. Thus, after <i>Bowen,</i> the plurality's distinction between a \"congressional mandate\" on the one hand and \"executive discretion\" on the other, <i>ante,</i> at 2568, is at once arbitrary and hard to manage: if the statute itself is constitutional, all complaints must be about the exercise of \"executive discretion,\" so there is no line to be drawn between <i>Bowen</i> and the case before us today.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2587</span> II</h2>\n<p>While <i>Flast</i> standing to assert the right of conscience is in a class by itself, it would be a mistake to think that case is unique in recognizing standing in a plaintiff without injury to flesh or purse. Cognizable harm takes account of the nature of the interest protected, which is the reason that \"the constitutional component of standing doctrine incorporates concepts concededly not susceptible of precise definition,\" leaving it impossible \"to make application of the constitutional standing requirement a mechanical exercise.\" <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S., at 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315. The question, ultimately, has to be whether the injury alleged is \"too abstract, or otherwise not appropriate, to be considered judicially cognizable.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 752, 104 S.Ct. 3315.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In the case of economic or physical harms, of course, the \"injury in fact\" question is straightforward. But once one strays from these obvious cases, the enquiry can turn subtle. Are esthetic harms sufficient for Article III standing? What about being forced to compete on an uneven playing field based on race (without showing that an economic loss resulted), or living in a racially gerrymandered electoral district? These injuries are no more concrete than seeing one's tax dollars spent on religion, but we have recognized each one as enough for standing. See <i>Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,</i> 528 U.S. 167, 183, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (esthetic injury); <i>Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville,</i> 508 U.S. 656, 666, 113 S.Ct. 2297, 124 L.Ed.2d 586 (1993) (\"[T]he `injury in fact' is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss of a contract\"); <i>United States v. Hays,</i> 515 U.S. 737, 744-745, 115 S.Ct. 2431, 132 L.Ed.2d 635 (1995) (living in a racially gerrymandered electoral district). This is not to say that any sort of alleged injury will satisfy Article III, but only that intangible harms must be evaluated case by case.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, <i>Flast</i> speaks for this Court's recognition (shared by a majority of the Court today) that when the Government spends money for religious purposes a taxpayer's injury is serious and concrete enough to be \"judicially cognizable,\" <i>Allen, supra,</i> at 752, 104 S.Ct. 3315. The judgment of sufficient injury takes account of the Madisonian relationship of tax money and conscience, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2588</span> but it equally reflects the Founders' pragmatic \"conviction that individual religious liberty could be achieved best under a government which was stripped of all power to tax, to support, or otherwise to assist any or all religions,\" <i>Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,</i> 330 U.S. 1, 11, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), and the realization continuing to the modern day that favoritism for religion \"`sends the ... message to ... nonadherents \"that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community,\"'\" <i>McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky.,</i> 545 U.S. 844, 860, 125 S.Ct. 2722, 162 L.Ed.2d 729 (2005) (quoting <i>Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v.

In 1965-1966, for example, 91.1 percent of all nonpublic elementary schools and 78.2 percent of all nonpublic secondary schools in the United States were religiously affiliated. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, Statistics of Nonpublic Elementary and Secondary Schools 1965-66, p. 7 (1968). Congress surely understood that much of the aid mandated by the statute would find its way to religious schools.</p>\n<p>[4]  See, <i>e.g.,</i> 119 Stat. 2472 (appropriating $53,830,000 \"to be available for allocation within the Executive Office of the President\").</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>Valley Forge</i> also relied on a second rationale: that the authorizing Act was an exercise of Congress' power under the Property Clause of Art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2, and not the Taxing and Spending Clause of Art. I, \u00a7 8. 454 U.S., at 480, 102 S.Ct. 752. But this conclusion merely provided an additional\u0097\"and perhaps redundan[t],\" <i>ibid.</i>\u0097basis for denying a claim of standing that was already foreclosed because it was not based on any congressional action.</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, the statute noted that the problems of adolescent premarital sex and pregnancy \"are best approached through a variety of integrated and essential services provided to adolescents and their families\" by \"religious and charitable organizations,\" among other groups. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300z(a)(8)(B) (1982 ed.). It went on to mandate that federally provided services in that area should \"emphasize the provision of support by other family members, religious and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups.\" \u00a7 300z(a)(10)(c). And it directed that demonstration projects funded by the government \"shall ... make use of support systems\" such as religious organizations, \u00a7 300z-2(a), and required grant applicants to describe how they would \"involve religious and charitable organizations\" in their projects, \u00a7 300z-5(a)(21)(B).</p>\n<p>[7]  Nor is it relevant that Congress may have informally \"earmarked\" portions of its general Executive Branch appropriations to fund the offices and centers whose expenditures are at issue here. See, <i>e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 107-342, p. 108 (2001). \"[A] fundamental principle of appropriations law is that where `Congress merely appropriates lump-sum amounts without statutorily restricting what can be done with those funds, a clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions, and indicia in committee reports and other legislative history as to how the funds should or are expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirements on' the agency.\" <i>Lincoln,</i> 508 U.S., at 192, 113 S.Ct. 2024 (quoting <i>In re LTV Aerospace Corp.,</i> 55 Comp. Gen. 307, 319 (1975)); see also <i>TVA v. Hill,</i> 437 U.S. 153, 191, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978) (\"Expressions of committees dealing with requests for appropriations cannot be equated with statutes enacted by Congress\").</p>\n<p>[1]  The text of the statute did not just authorize public-school teachers to read from the Bible, but <i>mandated</i> that they do so: \"At least five verses taken from that portion of the Holy Bible known as the Old Testament <i>shall be read,</i> or caused to be read, without comment, in each public school classroom, in the presence of the pupils therein assembled, <i>by the teacher in charge,</i> at the opening of school upon every school day... .\" N.J.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18:14-77 (1937) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[2]  There is a natural impulse to respond that the portion of the teachers' salary that corresponded to the time that they were required to read from the Bible was <i>de minimis.</i> But even <i>Flast</i> had the decency not to seize on a <i>de minimis</i> exception to distinguish <i>Doremus:</i> Having relied exclusively on Madison's Remonstrance to justify the conclusion that the Establishment Clause was a specific limitation on the taxing and spending power, see <i>Flast,</i> 392 U.S., at 103-104, 88 S.Ct. 1942, the Court could not simultaneously ignore Madison's admonition that \"`the same authority which can force a citizen <i>to contribute three pence only</i> of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 103, 88 S.Ct. 1942 (quoting Madison's Remonstrance; emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[3]  This explanation does not suffice with regard to Justice KENNEDY, who, unlike the other Members of the plurality, openly and avowedly contends both that <i>Flast</i> was correctly decided and that respondents should nevertheless lose this case. <i>Ante,</i> at 2572 (concurring opinion). He thus has the distinction of being the only Justice who affirms both propositions. I cannot begin to comprehend how the amorphous separation-of-powers concerns that motivate him, <i>ante,</i> at 2572-2573, bear upon whether the express-allocation requirement is grounded in the Article III criteria of injury in fact, traceability, or redressability.</p>\n<p>[4]  Nor is the dissent's oblique suggestion that <i>Doremus</i> did not involve an \"identifiable amoun[t]\" of taxpayer funds, <i>post,</i> at 2585 (opinion of SOUTER, J.), any more persuasive. One need not consult a CPA to realize that the portion of the school day during which the teachers' educational responsibilities were to read the Bible corresponded to a fraction of the teachers' taxpayer-funded salaries. And while the amount of money might well have been inconsequential, it was probably greater than three pence. See n. 2, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  It is true that this Court has occasionally in dicta described the prohibition on generalized grievances as merely a prudential bar. But the fountainhead of this dicta, <i>Warth v. Seldin,</i> 422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), supported its statement only by naked citation of <i>Schlesinger, Richardson,</i> and <i>Levitt.</i> 422 U.S., at 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197. But those cases squarely rested on Article III considerations, as the analysis in <i>Lujan</i> and <i>Lance</i> confirms.</p>\n<p>[1]  The plurality warns that a parade of horribles would result if there were standing to challenge executive action, because all federal activities are \"ultimately funded by some congressional appropriation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2569. But even if there is Article III standing in all of the cases posited by the plurality (and the Court of Appeals thought that at least sometimes there is not, 433 F.3d 989, 996 (C.A.7 2006)), that does not mean taxpayers will prevail in such suits. If these claims are frivolous on the merits, I fail to see the harm in dismissing them for failure to state a claim instead of for lack of jurisdiction. To the degree the claims are meritorious, fear that there will be many of them does not provide a compelling reason, much less a reason grounded in Article III, to keep them from being heard.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Bowen</i> also indicated that the barrier to standing in <i>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</i> 454 U.S. 464, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982), was that the taxpayers challenged \"an exercise of executive authority pursuant to the Property Clause of Article IV, \u00a7 3.\" <i>Bowen v. Kendrick,</i> 487 U.S. 589, 619, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988). In <i>Valley Forge,</i> we had first discussed the executive rather than legislative nature of the action at issue there and then, \"perhaps redundantly,\" 454 U.S., at 480, 102 S.Ct. 752, pointed to the distinction between the Property Clause and the Taxing and Spending Clause. Although at the time <i>Valley Forge</i> might have been taken to support the distinction the plurality draws today, <i>Bowen</i> said that <i>Valley Forge</i> rested on the distinction between the Property Clause on the one hand and the Taxing and Spending Clause on the other. See also <i>Valley Forge, supra,</i> at 480, n. 17, 102 S.Ct. 752 (noting that the transfer of property to a religious college involved no expenditure of funds).</p>\n<p>[3]  Although the plurality makes much of the fact that the injury in this case is \"generalized,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2563, and shared with the \"public-at-large,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2563, those properties on their own do not strip a would-be plaintiff of standing. See <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Akins,</i> 524 U.S. 11, 24, 118 S.Ct. 1777, 141 L.Ed.2d 10 (1998) (\"Often the fact that an interest is abstract and the fact that it is widely shared go hand in hand. But their association is not invariable, and where a harm is concrete, though widely shared, the Court has found `injury in fact'\").</p>\n<p>[4]  Outside the Establishment Clause context, as the plurality points out, we have not found the injury to a taxpayer when funds are improperly expended to suffice for standing. See <i>ante,</i> at 2568-2569 (citing examples).</p>\n<p>[5]  There will not always be competitors for the funds who would make better plaintiffs (and indeed there appears to be no such competitor here), so after accepting the importance of the injury there is no reason to refuse standing as a prudential matter.</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued February 28, 2007\u2014Decided June 25, 2007\nThe President, by executive orders, created a White House office and\n  several centers within federal agencies to ensure that faith-based\n  community groups are eligible to compete for federal financial sup-\n  port. No congressional legislation specifically authorized these enti-\n  ties, which were created entirely within the Executive Branch, nor\n  has Congress enacted any law specifically appropriating money to\n  their activities, which are funded through general Executive Branch\n  appropriations. Respondents, an organization opposed to Govern-\n  ment endorsement of religion and three of its members, brought this\n  suit alleging that petitioners, the directors of the federal offices, vio-\n  lated the Establishment Clause by organizing conferences that were\n  designed to promote, and had the effect of promoting, religious com-\n  munity groups over secular ones.

S. 83, federal\n  taxpayer standing is limited to Establishment Clause challenges to\n  the constitutionality of exercises of congressional power under the\n  taxing and spending clause of Art. I, \u00a78. Because petitioners acted on\n  the President\u2019s behalf and were not charged with administering a\n  congressional program, the court held that the challenged activities\n  did not authorize taxpayer standing under Flast. The Seventh Cir-\n  cuit reversed, reading Flast as granting federal taxpayers standing to\n2     HEIN v.

A controlling factor in the defini-\n  tion of such a case or controversy is standing, ASARCO Inc. v.\n  Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 613, the requisite elements of which are well\n  established: \u201cA plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable\n  to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be re-\n  dressed by the requested relief.\u201d Allen v.

Generally, a federal taxpayer\u2019s interest in seeing that Treasury\n  funds are spent in accordance with the Constitution is too attenuated\n  to give rise to the kind of redressable \u201cpersonal injury\u201d required for\n  Article III standing. See, e.g., Frothingham v. Mellon, decided with\n  Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 485\u2013486. Pp. 8\u201310.\n     3. In Flast, the Court carved out a narrow exception to the general\n  constitutional prohibition against taxpayer standing. The taxpayer-\n  plaintiff there alleged that the distribution of federal funds to reli-\n  gious schools under a federal statute violated the Establishment\n  Clause. The Court set out a two-part test for determining standing:\n  \u201cFirst, . . . a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitu-\n  tionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing\n  and spending clause of Art. I, \u00a78. . . . Secondly, the taxpayer must\n  show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional\n  limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and\n  spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally be-\n  yond the powers delegated to Congress by Art. I, \u00a78.\u201d 392 U. S., at\n  102\u2013103. The Court then held that the particular taxpayer had satis-\n  fied both prongs of the test. Id., at 103\u2013104. Pp. 11\u201312.\n     4. Respondents\u2019 broad reading of the Flast exception to cover any\n  expenditure of Government funds in violation of the Establishment\n  Clause fails to observe \u201cthe rigor with which the Flast exception to\n  the Frothingham principle ought to be applied.\u201d Valley Forge Chris-\n                   Cite as: 551 U.

Given that the alleged Establishment\nClause violation in Flast was funded by a specific congressional ap-\npropriation and was undertaken pursuant to an express congres-\nsional mandate, the Court concluded that the taxpayer-plaintiffs had\nestablished the requisite \u201clogical link between [their taxpayer] status\nand the type of legislative enactment attacked.\u201d 392 U. S., at 102.\n\u201cTheir constitutional challenge [was] made to an exercise by Con-\ngress of its power under Art. I, \u00a78, to spend for the general welfare.\u201d\nId., at 103. But Flast \u201climited taxpayer standing to challenges di-\nrected \u2018only [at] exercises of congressional power\u2019 \u201d under the Taxing\nand Spending Clause. Valley Forge, supra, at 479. Pp. 12\u201313.\n   5. The link between congressional action and constitutional viola-\ntion that supported taxpayer standing in Flast is missing here. Re-\nspondents neither challenge any specific congressional action or ap-\npropriation nor ask the Court to invalidate any congressional\nenactment or legislatively created program as unconstitutional. That\nis because the expenditures at issue were not made pursuant to any\nAct of Congress, but under general appropriations to the Executive\nBranch to fund day-to-day activities. These appropriations did not\nexpressly authorize, direct, or even mention the expenditures in ques-\ntion, which resulted from executive discretion, not congressional ac-\ntion. The Court has never found taxpayer standing under such cir-\ncumstances.       Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 619\u2013620,\ndistinguished. Pp. 13\u201318.\n   6. Respondents argue to no avail that distinguishing between\nmoney spent pursuant to congressional mandate and expenditures\nmade in the course of executive discretion is arbitrary because the in-\njury to taxpayers in both situations is the same as that targeted by\nthe Establishment Clause and Flast\u2014the expenditure for the support\nof religion of funds exacted from taxpayers. But Flast focused on\ncongressional action, and the invitation to extend its holding to en-\ncompass discretionary Executive Branch expenditures must be de-\nclined. The Court has repeatedly emphasized that the Flast excep-\ntion has a \u201cnarrow application,\u201d DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547\nU. S. ___, ___, that only \u201cslightly lowered\u201d the bar on taxpayer stand-\ning, United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 173, and that must\nbe applied with \u201crigor,\u201d Valley Forge, supra, at 481. Pp. 18\u201319.\n   7. Also rejected is respondents\u2019 argument that Executive Branch\nexpenditures in support of religion are no different from legislative\nextractions. Flast itself rejected this equivalence. 392 U. S., at 102.\nBecause almost all Executive Branch activity is ultimately funded by\nsome congressional appropriation, extending the Flast exception to\npurely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal\n4     HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    action\u2014be it a conference, proclamation, or speech\u2014to Establish-\n    ment Clause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court. Respon-\n    dents\u2019 proposed rule would also raise serious separation-of-powers\n    concerns, enlisting the federal courts to superintend, at the behest of\n    any federal taxpayer, the speeches, statements, and myriad daily ac-\n    tivities of the President, his staff, and other Executive Branch offi-\n    cials. Pp. 19\u201321.\n       8. Both the Seventh Circuit and respondents implicitly recognize\n    that unqualified federal taxpayer standing to assert Establishment\n    Clause claims would go too far, but neither has identified a workable\n    limitation. Taking the Circuit\u2019s zero-marginal-cost test literally\u2014i.e.,\n    that any marginal cost greater than zero suffices\u2014taxpayers might\n    well have standing to challenge some (and perhaps many) speeches\n    by Government officials. At a minimum, that approach would create\n    difficult and uncomfortable line-drawing problems. Respondents\u2019\n    proposal to require an expenditure to be fairly traceable to the con-\n    duct alleged to violate the Establishment Clause, so that challenges\n    to the content of any particular speech would be screened out, is too\n    vague and ill-defined to be accepted. Pp. 21\u201323.\n       9. None of the parade of horribles respondents claim could occur if\n    Flast is not extended to discretionary Executive Branch expenditures\n    has happened. In the unlikely event any do take place, Congress can\n    quickly step in. And respondents make no effort to show that these\n    improbable abuses could not be challenged in federal court by plain-\n    tiffs possessed of standing based on grounds other than their tax-\n    payer status. Pp. 23\u201324.\n       10. This case does not require the Court to reconsider Flast. The\n    Seventh Circuit did not apply Flast; it extended it. Valley Forge\n    Christian Academy illustrates that a necessary concomitant of stare\n    decisis is that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its\n    logic. That is the approach taken here. Flast is neither extended nor\n    overruled. It is simply left as it was. Pp. 24\u201325.\n       JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS, concurred in the\n    Court\u2019s judgment, concluding that Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83,\n    should be overruled as wholly irreconcilable with the Article III re-\n    strictions on federal-court jurisdiction that are embodied in the\n    standing doctrine. Pp. 1\u201321.\n       1. The Court\u2019s taxpayer-standing cases involving Establishment\n    Clause challenges to government expenditures are notoriously incon-\n    sistent because they have inconsistently described the relevant \u201cin-\n    jury in fact\u201d that Article III requires. Some cases have focused on the\n    financial effect on the taxpayer\u2019s wallet, whereas Flast and the cases\n    that follow its teaching have emphasized the mental displeasure the\n    taxpayer suffers when his funds are extracted and spent in aid of re-\n                     Cite as: 551 U.

If the mental displeasure created by Establish-\n  ment Clause violations is concrete and particularized enough to con-\n  stitute an Article III \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d then Flast should be applied to\n  (at a minimum) all challenges to government expenditures allegedly\n  violating constitutional provisions that specifically limit the taxing\n  and spending power; if not, Flast should be overturned. Pp. 2\u201312.\n     2. Today\u2019s plurality avails itself of neither principled option, in-\n  stead accepting the Government\u2019s submission that Flast should be\n  limited to challenges to expenditures that are expressly authorized or\n  mandated by specific congressional enactment. However, the plural-\n  ity gives no explanation as to why the factual differences between\n  this case and Flast are material. (Whether the challenged govern-\n  ment expenditure is expressly allocated by a specific congressional\n  enactment is not relevant to the Article III criteria of injury in fact,\n  traceability, and redressability.) Yet the plurality is also unwilling to\n  acknowledge that Flast erred by relying on purely mental injury.\n  Pp. 12\u201314.\n     3. Respondents\u2019 legal position is no more coherent than the plural-\n  ity\u2019s. They refuse to admit that their argument logically implies that\n  every expenditure of tax revenues that is alleged to violate the Estab-\n  lishment Clause is subject to suit under Flast. Of course, that posi-\n  tion finds no support in this Court\u2019s precedents or this Nation\u2019s his-\n  tory. Pp. 14\u201316.\n     4. A taxpayer\u2019s purely psychological disapproval that his funds\n  are being spent in an allegedly unlawful manner is never sufficiently\n  concrete and particularized to support Article III standing. See\n  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 573\u2013574. Although\n  overruling precedents is a serious undertaking, stare decisis should\n  not prevent the Court from doing so here. Flast was inconsistent\n  with the cases that came before it and undervalued the separation-of-\n  powers function of standing. Its lack of a logical theoretical under-\n  pinning has rendered the Court\u2019s taxpayer-standing doctrine so in-\n  comprehensible that appellate judges do not know what to make of it.\n  The case has engendered no reliance interests. Few cases less war-\n  rant stare decisis effect. It is past time to overturn Flast.

The plaintiffs contend that they\nmeet the standing requirements of Article III of the Con-\nstitution because they pay federal taxes.\n   It has long been established, however, that the payment\nof taxes is generally not enough to establish standing to\nchallenge an action taken by the Federal Government. In\nlight of the size of the federal budget, it is a complete\nfiction to argue that an unconstitutional federal expendi-\nture causes an individual federal taxpayer any measurable\n2   HEIN v.

And if every federal taxpayer could sue to\nchallenge any Government expenditure, the federal courts\nwould cease to function as courts of law and would be cast\nin the role of general complaint bureaus.\n   In Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968), we recognized a\nnarrow exception to the general rule against federal tax-\npayer standing. Under Flast, a plaintiff asserting an\nEstablishment Clause claim has standing to challenge a\nlaw authorizing the use of federal funds in a way that\nallegedly violates the Establishment Clause. In the pre-\nsent case, Congress did not specifically authorize the use\nof federal funds to pay for the conferences or speeches that\nthe plaintiffs challenged. Instead, the conferences and\nspeeches were paid for out of general Executive Branch\nappropriations. The Court of Appeals, however, held that\nthe plaintiffs have standing as taxpayers because the\nconferences were paid for with money appropriated by\nCongress.\n   The question that is presented here is whether this\nbroad reading of Flast is correct. We hold that it is not.\nWe therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n                              I\n                              A\n    In 2001, the President issued an executive order creat-\ning the White House Office of Faith-Based and Commu-\nnity Initiatives within the Executive Office of the Presi-\ndent.

FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ninvolving the question of taxpayer standing:\n    \u201cWe have no power per se to review and annul acts of\n    Congress on the ground that they are unconstitu-\n    tional. The question may be considered only when the\n    justification for some direct injury suffered or threat-\n    ened, presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest\n    upon such an act. . . . The party who invokes the\n    power must be able to show not only that the statute\n    is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately\n    in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the re-\n    sult of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers\n    in some indefinite way in common with people gener-\n    ally.\u201d Frothingham v. Mellon, decided with Massa-\n    chusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923).\n                             B\n  As a general matter, the interest of a federal taxpayer in\nseeing that Treasury funds are spent in accordance with\nthe Constitution does not give rise to the kind of redress-\nable \u201cpersonal injury\u201d required for Article III standing. Of\ncourse, a taxpayer has standing to challenge the collection\nof a specific tax assessment as unconstitutional; being\nforced to pay such a tax causes a real and immediate eco-\nnomic injury to the individual taxpayer. See, e.g., Follett v.\nTown of McCormick, 321 U. S. 573 (1944) (invalidating tax\non preaching on First Amendment grounds). But that is\nnot the interest on which respondents assert standing\nhere. Rather, their claim is that, having paid lawfully\ncollected taxes into the Federal Treasury at some point,\nthey have a continuing, legally cognizable interest in en-\nsuring that those funds are not used by the Government in\na way that violates the Constitution.\n  We have consistently held that this type of interest is\ntoo generalized and attenuated to support Article III\nstanding. In Frothingham, a federal taxpayer sought to\nchallenge federal appropriations for mothers\u2019 and chil-\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

S., at 486. We con-\ncluded that the plaintiff lacked the kind of particularized\ninjury required for Article III standing:\n    \u201c[I]nterest in the moneys of the Treasury . . . is shared\n    with millions of others; is comparatively minute and\n    indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of\n    any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating\n    and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal\n    to the preventive powers of a court of equity.\n       \u201cThe administration of any statute, likely to pro-\n    duce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast\n    number of taxpayers, the extent of whose several li-\n    ability is indefinite and constantly changing, is essen-\n    tially a matter of public and not of individual con-\n    cern.\u201d Id., at 487.\n   Because the interests of the taxpayer are, in essence,\nthe interests of the public-at-large, deciding a constitu-\ntional claim based solely on taxpayer standing \u201cwould be[,]\nnot to decide a judicial controversy, but to assume a posi-\ntion of authority over the governmental acts of another\nand co-equal department, an authority which plainly we\ndo not possess.\u201d Id., at 489; see also Alabama Power Co. v.\nIckes, 302 U. S. 464, 478\u2013479 (1938).\n   In Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429,\n433 (1952), we reaffirmed this principle, explaining that\n\u201cthe interests of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal\ntreasury are too indeterminable, remote, uncertain and\nindirect to furnish a basis for an appeal to the preventive\npowers of the Court over their manner of expenditure.\u201d\nWe therefore rejected a state taxpayer\u2019s claim of standing\nto challenge a state law authorizing public school teachers\n10   HEIN v.

The taxpayer-plaintiff in that case challenged the\ndistribution of federal funds to religious schools under the\nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, alleg-\ning that such aid violated the Establishment Clause. The\nCourt set out a two-part test for determining whether a\nfederal taxpayer has standing to challenge an allegedly\nunconstitutional expenditure:\n     \u201cFirst, the taxpayer must establish a logical link be-\n     tween that status and the type of legislative enact-\n     ment attacked. Thus, a taxpayer will be a proper\n     party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exer-\n     cises of congressional power under the taxing and\n     spending clause of Art. I, \u00a78, of the Constitution. It\n     will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expendi-\n     ture of tax funds in the administration of an essen-\n     tially regulatory statute. . . . Secondly, the taxpayer\n     must establish a nexus between that status and the\n     precise nature of the constitutional infringement al-\n     leged. Under this requirement, the taxpayer must\n     show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific\n     constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise\n     of the congressional taxing and spending power and\n     not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the\n     powers delegated to Congress by Art. I, \u00a78.\u201d Flast,\n     392 U. S., at 102\u2013103.\n   The Court held that the taxpayer-plaintiff in Flast had\nsatisfied both prongs of this test: The plaintiff\u2019s \u201cconstitu-\ntional challenge [was] made to an exercise by Congress of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nimmediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of\nits enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way\nin common with people generally\u201d).\n12   HEIN v.

But this broad reading\nfails to observe \u201cthe rigor with which the Flast exception\nto the Frothingham principle ought to be applied.\u201d Valley\nForge, 454 U. S., at 481.\n  The expenditures at issue in Flast were made pursuant\nto an express congressional mandate and a specific con-\ngressional appropriation. The plaintiff in that case chal-\nlenged disbursements made under the Elementary and\nSecondary Education Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 27. That Act\nexpressly appropriated the sum of $100 million for fiscal\nyear 1966, \u00a7201(b), id., at 36, and authorized the dis-\nbursement of those funds to local educational agencies for\nthe education of low-income students, see Flast, supra, at\n86. The Act mandated that local educational agencies\nreceiving such funds \u201cma[k]e provision for including spe-\ncial educational services and arrangements (such as dual\nenrollment, educational radio and television, and mobile\neducational services and equipment)\u201d in which students\nenrolled in private elementary and secondary schools\ncould participate, \u00a72, 79 Stat. 30\u201331.

S., at 90. And the judg-\nment reviewed by this Court in Flast solely concerned the\nquestion whether \u201cif [the challenged] expenditures are\nauthorized by the Act the statute constitutes a \u2018law re-\nspecting an establishment of religion\u2019 and law \u2018prohibiting\nthe free exercise thereof\u2019 \u201d under the First Amendment.\nFlast v. Gardner, 271 F. Supp. 1, 2 (SDNY 1967).\n   Given that the alleged Establishment Clause violation\nin Flast was funded by a specific congressional appropria-\ntion and was undertaken pursuant to an express congres-\nsional mandate, the Court concluded that the taxpayer-\nplaintiffs had established the requisite \u201clogical link be-\ntween [their taxpayer] status and the type of legislative\nenactment attacked.\u201d In the Court\u2019s words, \u201c[t]heir consti-\ntutional challenge [was] made to an exercise by Congress\nof its power under Art. I, \u00a78, to spend for the general\nwelfare.\u201d 392 U. S., at 90. But as this Court later noted,\nFlast \u201c limited taxpayer standing to challenges directed\n\u2018only [at] exercises of congressional power\u2019 \u201d under the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 At around the time the Act was passed and Flast was decided, the\n\ngreat majority of nonpublic elementary and secondary schools in the\nUnited States were associated with a church. In 1965\u20131966, for exam-\nple, 91.1 percent of all nonpublic elementary schools and 78.2 percent of\nall nonpublic secondary schools in the United States were religiously\naffiliated. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, Statistics of Non-\npublic Elementary and Secondary Schools 1965\u201366, p. 7 (1968). Con-\ngress surely understood that much of the aid mandated by the statute\nwould find its way to religious schools.\n14   HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nTaxing and Spending Clause. Valley Forge, 454 U. S., at\n479.\n                               B\n   The link between congressional action and constitu-\ntional violation that supported taxpayer standing in Flast\nis missing here. Respondents do not challenge any specific\ncongressional action or appropriation; nor do they ask the\nCourt to invalidate any congressional enactment or legis-\nlatively created program as unconstitutional. That is\nbecause the expenditures at issue here were not made\npursuant to any Act of Congress. Rather, Congress pro-\nvided general appropriations to the Executive Branch to\nfund its day-to-day activities.4 These appropriations did\nnot expressly authorize, direct, or even mention the ex-\npenditures of which respondents complain. Those expen-\nditures resulted from executive discretion, not congres-\nsional action.\n   We have never found taxpayer standing under such\ncircumstances. In Valley Forge, we held that a taxpayer\nlacked standing to challenge \u201ca decision by [the federal\nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare] to transfer\na parcel of federal property\u201d to a religious college because\nthis transfer was \u201cnot a congressional action.\u201d 454 U. S., at\n479. In fact, the connection to congressional action was\ncloser in Valley Forge than it is here, because in that case,\nthe \u201cparticular Executive Branch action\u201d being challenged\nwas at least \u201carguably authorized\u201d by the Federal Prop-\nerty and Administrative Services Act of 1949, which per-\nmitted federal agencies to transfer surplus property to\nprivate entities. Id., at 479, n. 15. Nevertheless, we found\nthat the plaintiffs lacked standing because Flast \u201climited\ntaxpayer standing to challenges directed \u2018only [at] exer-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See, e.g., 119 Stat. 2472 (appropriating $53,830,000 \u201cto be available\n\nfor allocation within the Executive Office of the President\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 551 U.

S. 208 (1974), the taxpayer-plaintiffs con-\ntended that the Incompatibility Clause of Article I prohib-\nited Members of Congress from holding commissions in\nthe Armed Forces Reserve. We held that these plaintiffs\nlacked standing under Flast because they \u201cdid not chal-\nlenge an enactment under Art. I, \u00a78, but rather the action\nof the Executive Branch in permitting Members of Con-\ngress to maintain their Reserve status.\u201d 418 U. S., at 228.\nThis was the case even though the plaintiffs sought to\nreclaim reservist pay received by those Members\u2014pay\nthat presumably was funded through Congress\u2019 general\nappropriations for the support of the Armed Forces: \u201cSuch\nrelief would follow from the invalidity of Executive action\nin paying persons who could not lawfully have been re-\nservists, not from the invalidity of the statutes authorizing\npay to those who lawfully were Reservists.\u201d Ibid., n. 17.\nSee also United States v.

But this conclusion merely provided an additional\u2014\n\u201cand perhaps redundan[t],\u201d ibid.\u2014basis for denying a claim of standing\nthat was already foreclosed because it was not based on any congres-\nsional action.\n16   HEIN v.

AFLA not only expressly\nauthorized and appropriated specific funds for grant-\nmaking, it also expressly contemplated that some of those\nmoneys might go to projects involving religious groups.\nSee id., at 595\u2013596; see also id., at 623 (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring) (noting the \u201cpartnership between governmen-\ntal and religious institutions contemplated by the\nAFLA\u201d).6 Unlike this case, Kendrick involved a \u201cprogram\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 For example, the statute noted that the problems of adolescent pre-\n\nmarital sex and pregnancy \u201care best approached through a variety of\nintegrated and essential services provided to adolescents and their\nfamilies\u201d by \u201creligious and charitable organizations,\u201d among other\ngroups. 42 U.

The best they can do is\nto point to unspecified, lump-sum \u201cCongressional budget\nappropriations\u201d for the general use of the Executive\nBranch\u2014the allocation of which \u201cis a[n] administrative\ndecision traditionally regarded as committed to agency\ndiscretion.\u201d Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 192 (1993).\nCharacterizing this case as an \u201cas-applied challenge\u201d to\nthese general appropriations statutes would stretch the\nmeaning of that term past its breaking point. It cannot be\nthat every legal challenge to a discretionary Executive\nBranch action implicates the constitutionality of the un-\nderlying congressional appropriation. When a criminal\ndefendant charges that a federal agent carried out an\nunreasonable search or seizure, we do not view that claim\nas an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of the\nstatute appropriating funds for the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation. Respondents have not established why the\ndiscretionary Executive Branch expenditures here, which\nare similarly funded by no-strings, lump-sum appropria-\ntions, should be viewed any differently.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Nor  is it relevant that Congress may have informally \u201cearmarked\u201d\nportions of its general Executive Branch appropriations to fund the\noffices and centers whose expenditures are at issue here. See, e.g.,\nH. R. Rep. No. 107\u2013342, p. 108 (2001). \u201c[A] fundamental principle of\nappropriations law is that where \u2018Congress merely appropriates lump-\nsum amounts without statutorily restricting what can be done with\nthose funds, a clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose\nlegally binding restrictions, and indicia in committee reports and other\nlegislative history as to how the funds should or are expected to be\nspent do not establish any legal requirements on\u2019 the agency.\u201d Lincoln,\n508 U.

We have declined to lower the taxpayer standing\nbar in suits alleging violations of any constitutional provi-\nsion apart from the Establishment Clause. See Tilton v.\nRichardson, 403 U.

We have similarly refused to extend\nFlast to permit taxpayer standing for Establishment\nClause challenges that do not implicate Congress\u2019 taxing\nand spending power. See Valley Forge, supra, at 479\u2013482\n(no taxpayer standing to challenge Executive Branch\naction taken pursuant to Property Clause of Art. IV); see\nalso District of Columbia Common Cause v.

In effect, we have adopted the position set forth by\nJustice Powell in his concurrence in Richardson and have\n\u201climit[ed] the expansion of federal taxpayer and citizen\nstanding in the absence of specific statutory authorization\nto an outer boundary drawn by the results in Flast . . . .\u201d\n418 U.

FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n                               2\n   While respondents argue that Executive Branch expen-\nditures in support of religion are no different from legisla-\ntive extractions, Flast itself rejected this equivalence: \u201cIt\nwill not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of\ntax funds in the administration of an essentially regula-\ntory statute.\u201d 392 U. S., at 102.\n   Because almost all Executive Branch activity is ulti-\nmately funded by some congressional appropriation, ex-\ntending the Flast exception to purely executive expendi-\ntures would effectively subject every federal action\u2014be it\na conference, proclamation or speech\u2014to Establishment\nClause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court. To see\nthe wide swathe of activity that respondents\u2019 proposed\nrule would cover, one need look no further than the\namended complaint in this action, which focuses largely on\nspeeches and presentations made by Executive Branch\nofficials. See, e.g., Amended Complaint \u00b632, App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 73a (challenging Executive Branch officials\u2019\n\u201csupport of national and regional conferences\u201d); id., \u00b633,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 73a\u201375a (challenging content of\nspeech by Secretary of Education); id., \u00b6\u00b635, 36, App. to\nPet. for Cert. 76a (challenging content of Presidential\nspeeches); id., \u00b641, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a (challenging\nExecutive Branch officials\u2019 \u201cpublic appearances\u201d and\n\u201cspeeches\u201d). Such a broad reading would ignore the first\nprong of Flast\u2019s standing test, which requires \u201ca logical\nlink between [taxpayer] status and the type of legislative\nenactment attacked.\u201d 392 U. S., at 102.\n   It would also raise serious separation-of-powers con-\ncerns. As we have recognized, Flast itself gave too little\nweight to these concerns. By framing the standing ques-\ntion solely in terms of whether the dispute would be pre-\nsented in an adversary context and in a form traditionally\nviewed as capable of judicial resolution, Flast \u201cfailed to\nrecognize that this doctrine has a separation-of-powers\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

Respondents\u2019 posi-\ntion, if adopted, would repeat and compound this mistake.\n   The constitutional requirements for federal-court juris-\ndiction\u2014including the standing requirements and Article\nIII\u2014\u201care an essential ingredient of separation and equili-\nbration of powers.\u201d Steel Co. v.

The rule respondents propose would enlist the\nfederal courts to superintend, at the behest of any federal\ntaxpayer, the speeches, statements, and myriad daily\nactivities of the President, his staff, and other Executive\nBranch officials.

FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nassert Establishment Clause claims would go too far, but\nneither the Court of Appeals nor respondents has identi-\nfied a workable limitation. The Court of Appeals, as\nnoted, conceded only that a taxpayer would lack standing\nwhere \u201cthe marginal or incremental cost to the taxpaying\npublic of the alleged violation of the establishment clause\u201d\nis \u201czero.\u201d 433 F. 3d, at 995. Applying this rule, the Court\nof Appeals opined that a taxpayer would not have stand-\ning to challenge a President\u2019s favorable reference to relig-\nion in a State of the Union address because the costs\nassociated with the speech \u201cwould be no greater merely\nbecause the President had mentioned Moses rather than\nJohn Stuart Mill.\u201d Ibid.\n   There is reason to question whether the Court of Ap-\npeals\u2019 intended for its zero-marginal-cost test to be taken\nliterally, because the court, without any apparent inquiry\ninto the costs of Secretary Paige\u2019s speech, went on to agree\nthat the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge that\nspeech. Id., at 996. But if we take the Court of Appeals\u2019\ntest literally\u2014i.e., that any marginal cost greater than\nzero suffices\u2014taxpayers might well have standing to\nchallenge some (and perhaps many) speeches. As Judge\nEasterbrook observed: \u201cThe total cost of presidential proc-\nlamations and speeches by Cabinet officers that touch on\nreligion (Thanksgiving and several other holidays) surely\nexceeds $500,000 annually; it may cost that much to use\nAir Force One and send a Secret Service detail to a single\nspeaking engagement.\u201d 447 F. 3d, at 989\u2013990 (concurring\nin denial of rehearing en banc). At a minimum, the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 approach (asking whether the marginal cost\nexceeded zero) would surely create difficult and uncom-\nfortable line-drawing problems. Suppose that it is alleged\nthat a speech writer or other staff member spent extra\ntime doing research for the purpose of including \u201creligious\nimagery\u201d in a speech. Suppose that a President or a Cabi-\nnet officer attends or speaks at a prayer breakfast and\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

Applying this test, they argue, would \u201cscree[n] out . . .\nchallenge[s to] the content of one particular speech, for\nexample the State of the Union address, as an Establish-\nment Clause violation.\u201d Id., at 21.\n   We find little comfort in this vague and ill-defined test.\nAs an initial matter, respondents fail to explain why the\n(often substantial) costs that attend, for example, a Presi-\ndential address are any less \u201ctraceable\u201d than the expenses\nrelated to the Executive Branch statements and confer-\nences at issue here. Indeed, respondents concede that\neven lawsuits involving de minimis amounts of taxpayer\nmoney can pass their proposed \u201ctraceability\u201d test. Id., at\n20, n. 6.\n   Moreover, the \u201ctraceability\u201d inquiry, depending on how\nit is framed, would appear to prove either too little or too\nmuch. If the question is whether an allegedly unconstitu-\ntional executive action can somehow be traced to taxpayer\nfunds in general, the answer will always be yes: Almost all\nExecutive Branch activities are ultimately funded by some\ncongressional appropriation, whether general or specific,\nwhich is in turn financed by tax receipts. If, on the other\nhand, the question is whether the challenged action can be\ntraced to the contributions of a particular taxpayer-\nplaintiff, the answer will almost always be no: As we\nrecognized in Frothingham, the interest of any individual\ntaxpayer in a particular federal expenditure \u201cis compara-\ntively minute and indeterminable . . . and constantly\nchanging.\u201d 262 U. S., at 487.\n24   HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n                               B\n   Respondents set out a parade of horribles that they\nclaim could occur if Flast is not extended to discretionary\nExecutive Branch expenditures. For example, they say, a\nfederal agency could use its discretionary funds to build a\nhouse of worship or to hire clergy of one denomination and\nsend them out to spread their faith. Or an agency could\nuse its funds to make bulk purchases of Stars of David,\ncrucifixes, or depictions of the star and crescent for use in\nits offices or for distribution to the employees or the gen-\neral public. Of course, none of these things has happened,\neven though Flast has not previously been expanded in the\nway that respondents urge. In the unlikely event that any\nof these executive actions did take place, Congress could\nquickly step in. And respondents make no effort to show\nthat these improbable abuses could not be challenged in\nfederal court by plaintiffs who would possess standing\nbased on grounds other than taxpayer standing.\n                              C\n   Over the years, Flast has been defended by some and\ncriticized by others. But the present case does not require\nus to reconsider that precedent. The Court of Appeals did\nnot apply Flast; it extended Flast. It is a necessary con-\ncomitant of the doctrine of stare decisis that a precedent is\nnot always expanded to the limit of its logic. That was the\napproach that then-Justice Rehnquist took in his opinion\nfor the Court in Valley Forge, and it is the approach we\ntake here. We do not extend Flast, but we also do not\noverrule it. We leave Flast as we found it.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA says that we must either overrule Flast\nor extend it to the limits of its logic.

See, e.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU. S. 555, 559\u2013560 (1992). The Court\u2019s decision in Flast v.\nCohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968), and in later cases applying it,\nmust be interpreted as respecting separation-of-powers\nprinciples but acknowledging as well that these principles,\nin some cases, must accommodate the First Amendment\u2019s\nEstablishment Clause. The clause expresses the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s special concern that freedom of conscience not be\ncompromised by government taxing and spending in sup-\nport of religion. In my view the result reached in Flast is\ncorrect and should not be called into question. For the\nreasons set forth by JUSTICE ALITO, however, Flast should\nnot be extended to permit taxpayer standing in the instant\nmatter. And I join his opinion in full.\n   Respondents\u2019 amended complaint challenged the reli-\ngious nature of national and regional conferences that\npromoted President Bush\u2019s Faith-Based and Community\nInitiatives. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a\u201377a. To support\nthe allegation respondents pointed to speeches given by\n2   HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nthe President and other executive officers, speeches with\nreligious references. Id., at 73a\u201376a. The complaint relies\non respondents\u2019 taxpayer status as the sole basis for\nstanding to maintain the suit but points to no specific use\nof Congress\u2019 taxing and spending power other than gen-\neral appropriations to fund the administration of the\nExecutive Branch. Id., at 71a\u201373a.\n   Flast established a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the rule\nagainst taxpayer standing. Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S.\n589, 618 (1988). To find standing in the circumstances of\nthis case would make the narrow exception boundless.\nThe public events and public speeches respondents seek to\ncall in question are part of the open discussion essential to\ndemocratic self-government.           The Executive Branch\nshould be free, as a general matter, to discover new ideas,\nto understand pressing public demands, and to find crea-\ntive responses to address governmental concerns. The\nexchange of ideas between and among the State and Fed-\neral Governments and their manifold, diverse constituen-\ncies sustains a free society. Permitting any and all tax-\npayers to challenge the content of these prototypical\nexecutive operations and dialogues would lead to judicial\nintervention so far exceeding traditional boundaries on the\nJudiciary that there would arise a real danger of judicial\noversight of executive duties.

Unfortunately, the consistency\nlies in the creation of utterly meaningless distinctions\nwhich separate the case at hand from the precedents that\nhave come out differently, but which cannot possibly be (in\nany sane world) the reason it comes out differently. If this\nCourt is to decide cases by rule of law rather than show of\nhands, we must surrender to logic and choose sides: Either\nFlast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968), should be applied to\n(at a minimum) all challenges to the governmental expen-\nditure of general tax revenues in a manner alleged to\nviolate a constitutional provision specifically limiting the\ntaxing and spending power, or Flast should be repudiated.\nFor me, the choice is easy. Flast is wholly irreconcilable\nwith the Article III restrictions on federal-court jurisdic-\ntion that this Court has repeatedly confirmed are embod-\nied in the doctrine of standing.\n2   HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                                 I\n                                A\n    There is a simple reason why our taxpayer-standing\ncases involving Establishment Clause challenges to gov-\nernment expenditures are notoriously inconsistent: We\nhave inconsistently described the first element of the\n\u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of standing,\u201d which\nminimum consists of (1) a \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d\n\u201c \u2018injury in fact\u2019 \u201d that is (2) fairly traceable to the defen-\ndant\u2019s alleged unlawful conduct and (3) likely to be re-\ndressed by a favorable decision. See Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560\u2013561 (1992). We have alter-\nnately relied on two entirely distinct conceptions of injury\nin fact, which for convenience I will call \u201cWallet Injury\u201d\nand \u201cPsychic Injury.\u201d\n    Wallet Injury is the type of concrete and particularized\ninjury one would expect to be asserted in a taxpayer suit,\nnamely, a claim that the plaintiff\u2019s tax liability is higher\nthan it would be, but for the allegedly unlawful govern-\nment action. The stumbling block for suits challenging\ngovernment expenditures based on this conventional type\nof injury is quite predictable. The plaintiff cannot satisfy\nthe traceability and redressability prongs of standing. It\nis uncertain what the plaintiff\u2019s tax bill would have been\nhad the allegedly forbidden expenditure not been made,\nand it is even more speculative whether the government\nwill, in response to an adverse court decision, lower taxes\nrather than spend the funds in some other manner.\n    Psychic Injury, on the other hand, has nothing to do\nwith the plaintiff\u2019s tax liability. Instead, the injury con-\nsists of the taxpayer\u2019s mental displeasure that money\nextracted from him is being spent in an unlawful manner.\nThis shift in focus eliminates traceability and redressabil-\nity problems. Psychic Injury is directly traceable to the\nimproper use of taxpayer funds, and it is redressed when\nthe improper use is enjoined, regardless of whether that\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            3\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninjunction affects the taxpayer\u2019s purse. Flast and the\ncases following its teaching have invoked a peculiarly\nrestricted version of Psychic Injury, permitting taxpayer\ndispleasure over unconstitutional spending to support\nstanding only if the constitutional provision allegedly\nviolated is a specific limitation on the taxing and spending\npower. Restricted or not, this conceptualizing of injury in\nfact in purely mental terms conflicts squarely with the\nfamiliar proposition that a plaintiff lacks a concrete and\nparticularized injury when his only complaint is the gen-\neralized grievance that the law is being violated. As we\nreaffirmed unanimously just this Term: \u201c \u2018We have consis-\ntently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally avail-\nable grievance about government\u2014claiming only harm to\nhis and every citizen\u2019s interest in proper application of the\nConstitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more\ndirectly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public\nat large\u2014does not state an Article III case or contro-\nversy.\u2019 \u201d Lance v. Coffman, 549 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (per\ncuriam) (slip op., at 3) (quoting Lujan, supra, at 573\u2013574).\n  As the following review of our cases demonstrates, we\ninitially denied taxpayer standing based on Wallet Injury,\nbut then found standing in some later cases based on the\nlimited version of Psychic Injury described above. The\nbasic logical flaw in our cases is thus twofold: We have\nnever explained why Psychic Injury was insufficient in the\ncases in which standing was denied, and we have never\nexplained why Psychic Injury, however limited, is cogni-\nzable under Article III.\n                              B\n                              1\n   Two pre-Flast cases are of critical importance. In Froth-\ningham v. Mellon, decided with Massachusetts v. Mellon,\n262 U. S. 447 (1923), the taxpayer challenged the constitu-\ntionality of the Maternity Act of 1921, alleging in part that\n4    HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe federal funding provided by the Act was not author-\nized by any provision of the Constitution. See id., at 476\u2013\n477 (argument for Frothingham), 479\u2013480 (opinion of the\nCourt). The Court held that the taxpayer lacked standing.\nAfter emphasizing that \u201cthe effect upon future taxation . . .\nof any payment out of [Treasury] funds\u201d was \u201cremote,\nfluctuating and uncertain,\u201d Frothingham, 262 U. S., at\n487, the Court concluded that \u201c[t]he party who invokes the\npower [of judicial review] must be able to show not only\nthat the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or is\nimmediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as\nthe result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suf-\nfers in some indefinite way in common with people gener-\nally,\u201d id., at 488. The Court was thus describing the\ntraceability and redressability problems with Wallet In-\njury, and rejecting Psychic Injury as a generalized griev-\nance rather than concrete and particularized harm.\n   The second significant pre-Flast case is Doremus v.\nBoard of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429 (1952). There\nthe taxpayers challenged under the Establishment Clause\na state law requiring public-school teachers to read the\nBible at the beginning of each school day. Id., at 430,\n433.1 Relying extensively on Frothingham, the Court\ndenied standing. After first emphasizing that there was\nno allegation that the Bible reading increased the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 taxes or the cost of running the schools, 342 U. S., at\n433, and then reaffirming that taxpayers must allege more\nthan an indefinite injury suffered in common with people\ngenerally, id., at 434, the Court concluded that the \u201cgriev-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The text of the statute did not just authorize public-school teachers\n\nto read from the Bible, but mandated that they do so: \u201cAt least five\nverses taken from that portion of the Holy Bible known as the Old\nTestament shall be read, or caused to be read, without comment, in\neach public school classroom, in the presence of the pupils therein\nassembled, by the teacher in charge, at the opening of school upon every\nschool day . . . .\u201d N. J. Rev. Stat. \u00a718:14\u201377 (1937) (emphasis added).\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           5\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nance which [the plaintiffs] sought to litigate here is not a\ndirect dollars-and-cents injury but is a religious differ-\nence,\u201d ibid. In addition to reiterating Frothingham\u2019s\ndescription of the unavoidable obstacles to recovery under\na taxpayer theory of Wallet Injury, Doremus rejected\nPsychic Injury in unmistakable terms. The opinion\u2019s\ndeprecation of a mere \u201creligious difference,\u201d in contrast to\na real \u201cdollars-and-cents injury,\u201d can only be understood\nas a flat denial of standing supported only by taxpayer\ndisapproval of the unconstitutional use of tax funds. If the\nCourt had thought that Psychic Injury was a permissible\nbasis for standing, it should have sufficed (as the dissent-\ning Justices in Doremus suggested, see 342 U. S., at 435\n(opinion of Douglas, J.)) that public employees were being\npaid in part to violate the Establishment Clause.\n                              2\n  Sixteen years after Doremus, the Court took a pivotal\nturn. In Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968), taxpayers\nchallenged the Elementary and Secondary Education Act\nof 1965, alleging that funds expended pursuant to the Act\nwere being used to support parochial schools. Id., at 85\u2013\n87. They argued that either the Act itself proscribed such\nexpenditures or that the Act violated the Establishment\nClause. Id., at 87, 90. The Court held that the taxpayers\nhad standing. Purportedly in order to determine whether\ntaxpayers have the \u201cpersonal stake and interest\u201d neces-\nsary to satisfy Article III, a two-pronged nexus test was\ninvented. Id., at 101\u2013102.\n  The first prong required the taxpayer to \u201cestablish a\nlogical link between [taxpayer] status and the type of\nlegislative enactment.\u201d Id., at 102. The Court described\nwhat that meant as follows:\n    \u201c[A] taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the un-\n    constitutionality only of exercises of congressional\n    power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I,\n6   HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n    \u00a78, of the Constitution. It will not be sufficient to al-\n    lege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the ad-\n    ministration of an essentially regulatory statute. This\n    requirement is consistent with the limitation imposed\n    upon state-taxpayer standing in federal courts in\n    Doremus . . . .\u201d Ibid.\nThe second prong required the taxpayer to \u201cestablish a\nnexus between [taxpayer] status and the precise nature of\nthe constitutional infringement alleged.\u201d Ibid. The Court\nelaborated that this required \u201cthe taxpayer [to] show that\nthe challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional\nlimitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional\ntaxing and spending power and not simply that the en-\nactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Con-\ngress by Art. I, \u00a78.\u201d Id., at 102\u2013103. The Court held that\nthe Establishment Clause was the type of specific limita-\ntion on the taxing and spending power that it had in mind\nbecause \u201cone of the specific evils feared by\u201d the Framers of\nthat Clause was that the taxing and spending power\nwould be used to favor one religion over another or to\nsupport religion generally. Id., at 103\u2013104 (relying exclu-\nsively upon Madison\u2019s famous Memorial and Remon-\nstrance Against Religious Assessments).\n   Because both prongs of its newly minted two-part test\nwere satisfied, Flast held that the taxpayers had standing.\nWallet Injury could not possibly have been the basis for\nthis conclusion, since the taxpayers in Flast were no more\nable to prove that success on the merits would reduce their\ntax burden than was the taxpayer in Frothingham. Thus,\nFlast relied on Psychic Injury to support standing, describ-\ning the \u201cinjury\u201d as the taxpayer\u2019s allegation that \u201chis tax\nmoney is being extracted and spent in violation of specific\nconstitutional protections against such abuses of legisla-\ntive power.\u201d 392 U. S., at 106.\n   But that created a problem: If the taxpayers in Flast\n                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                   7\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nhad standing based on Psychic Injury, and without regard\nto the effect of the litigation on their ultimate tax liability,\nwhy did not the taxpayers in Doremus and Frothingham\nhave standing on a similar basis? Enter the magical two-\npronged nexus test. It has often been pointed out, and\nnever refuted, that the criteria in Flast\u2019s two-part test are\nentirely unrelated to the purported goal of ensuring that\nthe plaintiff has a sufficient \u201cstake in the outcome of the\ncontroversy.\u201d See Flast, 392 U. S., at 121\u2013124 (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting); see also id., at 107 (Douglas, J., concurring);\nUnited States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 183 (1974)\n(Powell, J., concurring). In truth, the test was designed\nfor a quite different goal. Each prong was meant to dis-\nqualify from standing one of the two prior cases that\nwould otherwise contradict the holding of Flast. The first\nprong distinguished Doremus as involving a challenge to\nan \u201cincidental expenditure of tax funds in the administra-\ntion of an essentially regulatory statute,\u201d rather than a\nchallenge to a taxing and spending statute. See 392 U. S.,\nat 102. Did the Court proffer any reason why a taxpayer\u2019s\nPsychic Injury is less concrete and particularized, trace-\nable, or redressable when the challenged expenditures are\nincidental to an essentially regulatory statute (whatever\nthat means)? Not at all. Doremus had to be evaded, and\nso it was. In reality, of course, there is simply no material\ndifference between Flast and Doremus as far as Psychic\nInjury is concerned: If taxpayers upset with the govern-\nment\u2019s giving money to parochial schools had standing to\nsue, so should the taxpayers who disapproved of the gov-\nernment\u2019s paying public-school teachers to read the Bible.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 There is a natural impulse to respond that the portion of the teach-\n\ners\u2019 salary that corresponded to the time that they were required to\nread from the Bible was de minimis. But even Flast had the decency\nnot to seize on a de minimis exception to distinguish Doremus: Having\nrelied exclusively on Madison\u2019s Remonstrance to justify the conclusion\nthat the Establishment Clause was a specific limitation on the taxing\n8    HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Flast\u2019s dispatching of Frothingham via the second prong\nof the nexus test was only marginally less disingenuous.\nNot only does the relationship of the allegedly violated\nprovision to the taxing and spending power have no bear-\ning upon the concreteness or particularity of the Psychic\nInjury, see Part III, infra, but the existence of that rela-\ntionship does not even genuinely distinguish Flast from\nFrothingham. It is impossible to maintain that the Estab-\nlishment Clause is a more direct limitation on the taxing\nand spending power than the constitutional limitation\ninvoked in Frothingham, which is contained within the\nvery provision creating the power to tax and spend. Article\nI, \u00a78, cl. 1, provides: \u201cThe Congress shall have Power To\nlay and collect Taxes . . . , to pay the Debts and provide for\nthe common Defence and general Welfare of the United\nStates.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Though unmentioned in\nFlast, it was precisely this limitation upon the permissible\npurposes of taxing and spending upon which Mrs. Froth-\ningham relied. See, e.g., Brief for Appellant in Frothing-\nham, O. T. 1922, No. 962, p. 68 (\u201c[T]he words \u2018provide for\nthe common defence and general welfare of the United\nStates\u2019 are used as limitations on the taxing power\u201d); id.,\nat 26\u201381 (discussing the general welfare limitation at\nlength).\n                           3\n  Coherence and candor have fared no better in our later\ntaxpayer-standing cases. The three of them containing\nlengthy discussion of the Establishment Clause warrant\nanalysis.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nand spending power, see Flast, 392 U. S., at 103\u2013104, the Court could\nnot simultaneously ignore Madison\u2019s admonition that \u201c \u2018the same\nauthority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his\nproperty for the support of any one establishment, may force him to\nconform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever,\u2019 \u201d id., at\n103 (quoting Madison\u2019s Remonstrance; emphasis added).\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           9\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  Flast was dismissively and unpersuasively distin-\nguished just 13 years later in Valley Forge Christian\nCollege v. Americans United for Separation of Church and\nState, Inc., 454 U. S. 464 (1982). The taxpayers there\nchallenged the decision of the Department of Health,\nEducation, and Welfare to give a 77-acre tract of Govern-\nment property, worth over half a million dollars, to a\nreligious organization. Id., at 468. The Court, adhering to\nthe strict letter of Flast\u2019s two-pronged nexus test, held\nthat the taxpayers lacked standing. Flast\u2019s first prong\nwas not satisfied: Rather than challenging a congressional\ntaxing and spending statute, the plaintiffs were attacking\nan agency decision to transfer federal property pursuant\nto Congress\u2019s power under the Property Clause, Art. IV,\n\u00a73, cl. 2. 454 U. S., at 479\u2013480.\n  In distinguishing between the Spending Clause and the\nProperty Clause, Valley Forge achieved the seemingly\nimpossible: It surpassed the high bar for irrationality set\nby Flast\u2019s distinguishing of Doremus and Frothingham.\nLike the dissenters in Valley Forge, see 454 U. S., at 511\u2013\n512 (opinion of Brennan, J.); id., at 513\u2013514 (opinion of\nSTEVENS, J.), I cannot fathom why Article III standing\nshould turn on whether the government enables a reli-\ngious organization to obtain real estate by giving it a\ncheck drawn from general tax revenues or instead by\nbuying the property itself and then transferring title.\n  While Valley Forge\u2019s application of the first prong to\ndistinguish Flast was unpersuasive, the Court was at least\nnot trying to hide the ball. Its holding was forthrightly\nbased on a resounding rejection of the very concept of\nPsychic Injury:\n    \u201c[Plaintiffs] fail to identify any personal injury suf-\n    fered by them as a consequence of the alleged consti-\n    tutional error, other than the psychological conse-\n    quence presumably produced by observation of\n10   HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n     conduct with which one disagrees. That is not an in-\n     jury sufficient to confer standing under Art. III, even\n     though the disagreement is phrased in constitutional\n     terms. It is evident that respondents are firmly com-\n     mitted to the constitutional principle of separation of\n     church and State, but standing is not measured by the\n     intensity of the litigant\u2019s interest or the fervor of his\n     advocacy.\u201d 454 U. S., at 485\u2013486 (emphasis omitted).\nOf course, in keeping with what was to become the shame-\nful tradition of our taxpayer-standing cases, the Court\u2019s\ncandor about the inadequacy of Psychic Injury was com-\nbined with a notable silence as to why Flast itself was not\ndoomed.\n  A mere six years later, Flast was resuscitated in Bowen\nv. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589 (1988). The taxpayers there\nbrought facial and as-applied Establishment Clause chal-\nlenges to the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA), which\nwas a congressional scheme that provided grants to public\nor nonprofit private organizations to combat premarital\nadolescent pregnancy and sex. Id., at 593. The as-applied\nchallenge focused on whether particular grantees selected\nby the Secretary of Health and Human Services were\nconstitutionally permissible recipients. Id., at 620\u2013622.\nThe Solicitor General argued that, under Valley Forge\u2019s\napplication of Flast\u2019s first prong, the taxpayers lacked\nstanding for their as-applied claim because that claim was\nreally a challenge to executive decisionmaking, not to\nCongress\u2019s exercise of its taxing and spending power. 487\nU. S., at 618\u2013619. The Court rejected this contention,\nholding that the taxpayers\u2019 as-applied claim was still a\nchallenge to Congress\u2019s taxing and spending power even\nthough disbursement of the funds authorized by Congress\nhad been administered by the Secretary. Id., at 619.\n  Kendrick, like Flast before it, was obviously based on\nPsychic Injury: The taxpayers could not possibly make,\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           11\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nand did not attempt to make, the showing required for\nWallet Injury. But by relying on Psychic Injury, Kendrick\nperfectly revealed the incompatibility of that concept with\nthe outcome in Doremus. Just as Kendrick did not care\nwhether the appropriated funds would have been spent\nanyway\u2014given to a different, permissible recipient\u2014so\nalso Doremus should not have cared that the teachers\nwould likely receive the same salary once their classroom\nactivities were limited to secular conduct. Flast and Ken-\ndrick\u2019s acceptance of Psychic Injury is fundamentally at\nodds with Frothingham, Doremus, and Valley Forge.\n  Which brings me to the final case worthy of mention.\nLast Term, in DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S.\n___ (2006), we concisely confirmed that Flast was based on\nPsychic Injury. The taxpayers in that case sought to rely\non Flast to raise a Commerce Clause challenge to a state\nfranchise tax credit. 547 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). In\nrejecting the analogy and denying standing, we described\nFlast as follows:\n    \u201cThe Court . . . understood the \u2018injury\u2019 alleged in Es-\n    tablishment Clause challenges to federal spending to\n    be the very \u2018extract[ion] and spen[ding]\u2019 of \u2018tax money\u2019\n    in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff. And an injunc-\n    tion against the spending would of course redress that\n    injury, regardless of whether lawmakers would dis-\n    pose of the savings in a way that would benefit the\n    taxpayer-plaintiffs personally.\u201d 547 U. S., at ___\n    (slip op., at 13) (citation omitted; some alterations in\n    original).\nWhat Cuno\u2019s conceptualization of Flast reveals is that\nthere are only two logical routes available to this Court.\nWe must initially decide whether Psychic Injury is consis-\ntent with Article III. If it is, we should apply Flast to all\nchallenges to government expenditures in violation of\nconstitutional provisions that specifically limit the taxing\n12   HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nand spending power; if it is not, we should overturn Flast.\n                               II\n                               A\n   The plurality today avails itself of neither principled\noption. Instead, essentially accepting the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s primary submission, it limits Flast to challenges to\nexpenditures that are \u201cexpressly authorized or mandated\nby . . . specific congressional enactment.\u201d Ante, at 18. It\noffers no intellectual justification for this limitation, ex-\ncept that \u201c[i]t is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of\nstare decisis that a precedent is not always expanded to\nthe limit of its logic.\u201d Ante, at 24. That is true enough,\nbut since courts purport to be engaged in reasoned deci-\nsionmaking, it is only true when (1) the precedent\u2019s logic is\nseen to require narrowing or readjustment in light of\nrelevant distinctions that the new fact situation brings to\nthe fore; or (2) its logic is fundamentally flawed, and so\ndeserves to be limited to the facts that begot it. Today\u2019s\nplurality claims neither of these justifications. As to the\nfirst, the plurality offers no explanation of why the factual\ndifferences between this case and Flast are material. It\nvirtually admits that express congressional allocation vel\nnon has nothing to do with whether the plaintiffs have\nalleged an injury in fact that is fairly traceable and likely\nto be redressed. See ante, at 18\u201319. As the dissent cor-\nrectly contends and I shall not belabor, see post, at 3\u20134\n(opinion of SOUTER, J.), Flast is indistinguishable from\nthis case for purposes of Article III. Whether the chal-\nlenged government expenditure is expressly allocated by a\nspecific congressional enactment has absolutely no rele-\nvance to the Article III criteria of injury in fact, traceabil-\nity, and redressability.\n   Yet the plurality is also unwilling to acknowledge that\nthe logic of Flast (its Psychic Injury rationale) is simply\nwrong, and for that reason should not be extended to other\n                    Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                  13\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncases. Despite the lack of acknowledgment, however, that\nis the only plausible explanation for the plurality\u2019s indif-\nference to whether the \u201cdistinguishing\u201d fact is legally\nmaterial, and for its determination to limit Flast to its\n\u201c \u2018resul[t],\u2019 \u201d ante, at 19.3 Why, then, pick a distinguishing\nfact that may breathe life into Flast in future cases, pre-\nserving the disreputable disarray of our Establishment\nClause standing jurisprudence? Why not hold that only\ntaxpayers raising Establishment Clause challenges to\nexpenditures pursuant to the Elementary and Secondary\nEducation Act of 1965 have standing? That, I suppose,\nwould be too obvious a repudiation of Flast, and thus an\nimpediment to the plurality\u2019s pose of minimalism.\n    Because the express-allocation line has no mooring to\nour tripartite test for Article III standing, it invites de-\nmonstrably absurd results. For example, the plurality\nwould deny standing to a taxpayer challenging the Presi-\ndent\u2019s disbursement to a religious organization of a dis-\ncrete appropriation that Congress had not explicitly allo-\ncated to that purpose, even if everyone knew that\nCongress and the President had informally negotiated\nthat the entire sum would be spent in that precise man-\nner. See ante, at 17, n. 7 (holding that nonstatutory ear-\nmarks are insufficient to satisfy the express-allocation\nrequirement). And taxpayers should lack standing to\nbring Establishment Clause challenges to the Executive\nBranch\u2019s use of appropriated funds when those expendi-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 This explanation does not suffice with regard to JUSTICE KENNEDY,\n\nwho, unlike the other Members of the plurality, openly and avowedly\ncontends both that Flast was correctly decided and that respondents\nshould nevertheless lose this case. Ante, at 1 (concurring opinion). He\nthus has the distinction of being the only Justice who affirms both\npropositions. I cannot begin to comprehend how the amorphous sepa-\nration-of-powers concerns that motivate him, ante, at 1\u20133, bear upon\nwhether the express-allocation requirement is grounded in the Article\nIII criteria of injury in fact, traceability, or redressability.\n14   HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntures have the added vice of violating congressional re-\nstrictions. If, for example, Congress instructs the Presi-\ndent to disburse grants to hospitals that he deems worthy,\nand the President instead gives all of the money to the\nCatholic Church, \u201c[t]he link between congressional action\nand constitutional violation that supported taxpayer\nstanding in Flast [would be] missing.\u201d Ante, at 14. In-\ndeed, taking the plurality at its word, Congress could\ninsulate the President from all Flast-based suits by codify-\ning the truism that no appropriation can be spent by the\nExecutive Branch in a manner that violates the Estab-\nlishment Clause.\n   Any last pretense of minimalism\u2014of adhering to prior\nlaw but merely declining to \u201cextend\u201d it\u2014is swept away by\nthe fact that the Court\u2019s holding flatly contradicts Ken-\ndrick. The whole point of the as-applied challenge in\nKendrick was that the Secretary, not Congress, had chosen\ninappropriate grant recipients. 487 U. S., at 620\u2013622.\nBoth Kendrick and this case equally involve, in the rele-\nvant sense, attacks on executive discretion rather than\ncongressional decision: Congress generally authorized the\nspending of tax funds for certain purposes but did not\nexplicitly mandate that they be spent in the unconstitu-\ntional manner challenged by the taxpayers. I thus share\nthe dissent\u2019s bewilderment, see post, at 4\u20135 (opinion of\nSOUTER, J.), as to why the plurality fixates on the amount\nof additional discretion the Executive Branch enjoys\nunder the law beyond the only discretion relevant to the\nEstablishment Clause issue: whether to spend taxpayer\nfunds for a purpose that is unconstitutional. See ante, at\n25 (focusing on whether the case involves \u201ca purely discre-\ntionary Executive Branch expenditure\u201d (emphasis added)).\n                              B\n   While I have been critical of the Members of the plural-\nity, I by no means wish to give the impression that re-\n                     Cite as: 551 U.

Respon-\ndents argue that Flast did not turn on whether Congress\nhas expressly allocated the funds to the allegedly uncon-\nstitutional use, and their case plainly rests on Psychic\nInjury. They repeatedly emphasize that the injury in\nFlast was merely the governmental extraction and spend-\ning of tax money in aid of religion. See, e.g., Brief for\nRespondents 28. Respondents refuse to admit that their\nargument logically implies, for the reasons already dis-\ncussed, that every expenditure of tax revenues that is\nalleged to violate the Establishment Clause is subject to\nsuit under Flast.\n  Of course, such a concession would run headlong into\nthe denial of standing in Doremus. Respondents\u2019 only\nanswer to Doremus is the cryptic assertion that the injury\nthere was not fairly traceable to the unconstitutional\nconduct. Brief for Respondents 21, and n. 7. This makes\nno sense. On Flast\u2019s theory of Psychic Injury, the injury in\nDoremus was perfectly traceable and not in any way at-\ntenuated. It consisted of the psychic frustration that tax\nfunds were being used in violation of the Establishment\nClause, which was directly caused by the paying of teach-\ners to read the Bible, and which would have been reme-\ndied by prohibition of that expenditure.4 The hollowness\nof respondents\u2019 traceability argument is perhaps best\ndemonstrated by their counsel\u2019s game submission at oral\nargument that there would be standing to challenge the\nhiring of a single Secret Service agent who guarded the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Nor is the dissent\u2019s oblique suggestion that Doremus did not involve\nan \u201cidentifiable amoun[t]\u201d of taxpayer funds, post, at 3 (opinion of\nSOUTER, J.), any more persuasive. One need not consult a CPA to\nrealize that the portion of the school day during which the teachers\u2019\neducational responsibilities were to read the Bible corresponded to a\nfraction of the teachers\u2019 taxpayer-funded salaries. And while the\namount of money might well have been inconsequential, it was proba-\nbly greater than three pence. See n. 2, supra.\n16   HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nPresident during religious trips, but no standing if those\nresponsibilities (and the corresponding taxpayer-funded\ncompensation) were spread out over the entire Secret\nService protective detail. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38\u201339.\n  The logical consequence of respondents\u2019 position finds no\nsupport in this Court\u2019s precedents or our Nation\u2019s history.\nAny taxpayer would be able to sue whenever tax funds\nwere used in alleged violation of the Establishment\nClause. So, for example, any taxpayer could challenge the\nfact that the Marshal of our Court is paid, in part, to call\nthe courtroom to order by proclaiming \u201cGod Save the\nUnited States and this Honorable Court.\u201d As much as\nrespondents wish to deny that this is what Flast logically\nentails, it blinks reality to conclude otherwise. If respon-\ndents are to prevail, they must endorse a future in which\nideologically motivated taxpayers could \u201croam the country\nin search of governmental wrongdoing and . . . reveal their\ndiscoveries in federal court,\u201d transforming those courts\ninto \u201combudsmen of the general welfare\u201d with respect to\nEstablishment Clause issues. Valley Forge, 454 U. S., at\n487.\n                                C\n   Ultimately, the arguments by the parties in this case\nand the opinions of my colleagues serve only to confirm\nthat Flast\u2019s adoption of Psychic Injury has to be addressed\nhead-on. Minimalism is an admirable judicial trait, but\nnot when it comes at the cost of meaningless and disin-\ngenuous distinctions that hold the sure promise of engen-\ndering further meaningless and disingenuous distinctions\nin the future. The rule of law is ill served by forcing law-\nyers and judges to make arguments that deaden the soul\nof the law, which is logic and reason. Either Flast was\ncorrect, and must be accorded the wide application that it\nlogically dictates, or it was not, and must be abandoned in\nits entirety. I turn, finally, to that question.\n                    Cite as: 551 U.

The answer is plainly no.\n   As I noted at the outset, Lujan explained that the \u201ccon-\nsisten[t]\u201d view of this Court has been that \u201ca plaintiff\nraising only a generally available grievance about gov-\nernment\u2014claiming only harm to his and every citizen\u2019s\ninterest in proper application of the Constitution and laws,\nand seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly\nbenefits him than it does the public at large\u2014does not\nstate an Article III case or controversy.\u201d 504 U. S., at 573\u2013\n574. As evidence of the consistency with which we have\naffirmed that understanding, Lujan relied on the reason-\ning in Frothingham, and in several other cases, including\nEx parte L\u00e9vitt, 302 U. S. 633 (1937) (dismissing suit\nchallenging Justice Black\u2019s appointment to this Court in\nalleged violation of the Ineligibility Clause, Art. I, \u00a76,\ncl. 2), United States v.

S.,\nat 573\u2013577. Just this Term, relying on precisely the same\ncases and the same reasoning, we held unanimously that\nsuits raising only generalized grievances do not satisfy\nArticle III\u2019s requirement that the injury in fact be concrete\nand particularized. See Lance, 549 U.

But\n18   HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Nor does Flast\u2019s limitation on Psychic Injury\u2014the limi-\ntation that it suffices only when the two-pronged \u201cnexus\u201d\ntest is met\u2014cure the Article III deficiency. The fact that it\nis the alleged violation of a specific constitutional limit on\nthe taxing and spending power that produces the tax-\npayer\u2019s mental angst does not change the fundamental\nflaw. It remains the case that the taxpayer seeks \u201crelief\nthat no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it\ndoes the public at large.\u201d Lujan, supra, at 573\u2013574. And\nit is of no conceivable relevance to this issue whether the\nEstablishment Clause was originally conceived of as a\nspecific limitation on the taxing and spending power.\nMadison\u2019s Remonstrance has nothing whatever to say on\nthe question whether suits alleging violations of that\nlimitation are anything other than the generalized griev-\nances that federal courts had always been barred from\nconsidering before Flast. Flast was forced to rely on the\nslim reed of the Remonstrance since there was no better\nsupport for its novel conclusion, in 1968, that violation of\nthe Establishment Clause, unique among the provisions of\nour law, had always inflicted a personalized Psychic Injury\nupon all taxpayers that federal courts had the power to\nremedy.\n   Moreover, Flast is damaged goods, not only because its\nfanciful two-pronged \u201cnexus\u201d test has been demonstrated\nto be irrelevant to the test\u2019s supposed objective, but also\nbecause its cavalier treatment of the standing requirement\nrested upon a fundamental underestimation of that re-\nquirement\u2019s importance. Flast was explicitly and errone-\nously premised on the idea that Article III standing does\nnot perform a crucial separation-of-powers function:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe fountainhead of this dicta, Warth v.

And once a proper\nunderstanding of the relationship of standing to the sepa-\nration of powers is brought to bear, Psychic Injury, even as\nlimited in Flast, is revealed for what it is: a contradiction\nof the basic propositions that the function of the judicial\npower \u201cis, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals,\u201d\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 170 (1803), and that\ngeneralized grievances affecting the public at large have\ntheir remedy in the political process.\n  Overruling prior precedents, even precedents as dis-\nreputable as Flast, is nevertheless a serious undertaking,\nand I understand the impulse to take a minimalist ap-\nproach. But laying just claim to be honoring stare decisis\nrequires more than beating Flast to a pulp and then send-\ning it out to the lower courts weakened, denigrated, more\nincomprehensible than ever, and yet somehow technically\nalive. Even before the addition of the new meaningless\ndistinction devised by today\u2019s plurality, taxpayer standing\nin Establishment Clause cases has been a game of chance.\nIn the proceedings below, well-respected federal judges\ndeclined to hear this case en banc, not because they\nthought the issue unimportant or the panel decision cor-\nrect, but simply because they found our cases so lawless\nthat there was no point in, quite literally, second-guessing\nthe panel.

The three pence implicates the conscience, and\nthe injury from Government expenditures on religion is\nnot accurately classified with the \u201cPsychic Injury\u201d that\nresults whenever a congressional appropriation or execu-\ntive expenditure raises hackles of disagreement with the\npolicy supported, see ante, at 8 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            3\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\njudgment). Justice Stewart recognized this in his concur-\nring opinion in Flast, when he said that \u201cevery taxpayer\ncan claim a personal constitutional right not to be taxed\nfor the support of a religious institution,\u201d and thus distin-\nguished the case from one in which a taxpayer sought only\nto air a generalized grievance in federal court. 392 U. S.,\nat 114.\n   Here, there is no dispute that taxpayer money in identi-\nfiable amounts is funding conferences, and these are\nalleged to have the purpose of promoting religion. Cf.\nDoremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429, 434\n(1952). The taxpayers therefore seek not to \u201cextend\u201d Flast,\nante, at 24 (plurality opinion), but merely to apply it.\nWhen executive agencies spend identifiable sums of tax\nmoney for religious purposes, no less than when Congress\nauthorizes the same thing, taxpayers suffer injury. And\nonce we recognize the injury as sufficient for Article III,\nthere can be no serious question about the other elements\nof the standing enquiry: the injury is indisputably \u201ctrace-\nable\u201d to the spending, and \u201clikely to be redressed by\u201d an\ninjunction prohibiting it. Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737,\n751 (1984); see also Cuno, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13)\n(\u201c[A]n injunction against the spending would of course\nredress that injury\u201d).\n   The plurality points to the separation of powers to ex-\nplain its distinction between legislative and executive\nspending decisions, see ante, at 20\u201321, but there is no\ndifference on that point of view between a Judicial Branch\nreview of an executive decision and a judicial evaluation of\na congressional one. We owe respect to each of the other\nbranches, no more to the former than to the latter, and no\none has suggested that the Establishment Clause lacks\napplicability to executive uses of money. It would surely\nviolate the Establishment Clause for the Department of\nHealth and Human Services to draw on a general appro-\npriation to build a chapel for weekly church services (no\n4    HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                          SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nless than if a statute required it), and for good reason: if\nthe Executive could accomplish through the exercise of\ndiscretion exactly what Congress cannot do through legis-\nlation, Establishment Clause protection would melt away.1\n   So in Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589 (1988), we rec-\nognized the equivalence between a challenge to a congres-\nsional spending bill and a claim that the Executive Branch\nwas spending an appropriation, each in violation of the\nEstablishment Clause. We held that the \u201cclaim that . . .\nfunds [were] being used improperly by individual grantees\n[was no] less a challenge to congressional taxing and\nspending power simply because the funding authorized by\nCongress has flowed through and been administered by\nthe Secretary,\u201d and we added that \u201cwe have not ques-\ntioned the standing of taxpayer plaintiffs to raise Estab-\nlishment Clause challenges, even when their claims raised\nquestions about the administratively made grants.\u201d Id., at\n619.\n   The plurality points out that the statute in Bowen \u201cex-\npressly authorized and appropriated specific funds for\ngrantmaking\u201d and \u201cexpressly contemplated that some of\nthose moneys might go to projects involving religious\ngroups.\u201d Ante, at 16. That is all true, but there is no\nreason to think it should matter, and every indication in\nBowen that it did not. In Bowen we already had found the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The plurality warns that a parade of horribles would result if there\n\nwere standing to challenge executive action, because all federal activi-\nties are \u201cultimately funded by some congressional appropriation.\u201d Ante,\nat 20. But even if there is Article III standing in all of the cases posited\nby the plurality (and the Court of Appeals thought that at least some-\ntimes there is not, 433 F. 3d 989, 996 (CA7 2006)), that does not mean\ntaxpayers will prevail in such suits. If these claims are frivolous on the\nmerits, I fail to see the harm in dismissing them for failure to state a\nclaim instead of for lack of jurisdiction. To the degree the claims are\nmeritorious, fear that there will be many of them does not provide a\ncompelling reason, much less a reason grounded in Article III, to keep\nthem from being heard.\n                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                    5\n\n                         SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nstatute valid on its face before we turned to the taxpayers\u2019\nas-applied challenge, see 487 U. S., at 618, so the case\ncannot be read to hold that taxpayers have standing only\nto claim that congressional action, but not its implementa-\ntion, violates the Establishment Clause. Thus, after Bo-\nwen, the plurality\u2019s distinction between a \u201ccongressional\nmandate\u201d on the one hand and \u201cexecutive discretion\u201d on\nthe other, ante, at 18, is at once arbitrary and hard to\nmanage: if the statute itself is constitutional, all com-\nplaints must be about the exercise of \u201cexecutive discre-\ntion,\u201d so there is no line to be drawn between Bowen and\nthe case before us today.2\n                                II\n  While Flast standing to assert the right of conscience is\nin a class by itself, it would be a mistake to think that case\nis unique in recognizing standing in a plaintiff without\ninjury to flesh or purse. Cognizable harm takes account of\nthe nature of the interest protected, which is the reason\nthat \u201cthe constitutional component of standing doctrine\nincorporates concepts concededly not susceptible of precise\ndefinition,\u201d leaving it impossible \u201cto make application of\nthe constitutional standing requirement a mechanical\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Bowen also indicated that the barrier to standing in Valley Forge\n\nChristian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and\nState, Inc., 454 U. S. 464 (1982), was that the taxpayers challenged \u201can\nexercise of executive authority pursuant to the Property Clause of\nArticle IV, \u00a73.\u201d Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 619 (1988). In Valley\nForge, we had first discussed the executive rather than legislative\nnature of the action at issue there and then, \u201cperhaps redundantly,\u201d\n454 U. S., at 480, pointed to the distinction between the Property\nClause and the Taxing and Spending Clause. Although at the time\nValley Forge might have been taken to support the distinction the\nplurality draws today, Bowen said that Valley Forge rested on the\ndistinction between the Property Clause on the one hand and the\nTaxing and Spending Clause on the other. See also Valley Forge,\nsupra, at 480, n. 17 (noting that the transfer of property to a religious\ncollege involved no expenditure of funds).\n6     HEIN v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n                          SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nexercise.\u201d Allen, 468 U. S., at 751. The question, ulti-\nmately, has to be whether the injury alleged is \u201ctoo ab-\nstract, or otherwise not appropriate, to be considered\njudicially cognizable.\u201d Id., at 752.3\n   In the case of economic or physical harms, of course, the\n\u201cinjury in fact\u201d question is straightforward. But once one\nstrays from these obvious cases, the enquiry can turn\nsubtle. Are esthetic harms sufficient for Article III stand-\ning? What about being forced to compete on an uneven\nplaying field based on race (without showing that an\neconomic loss resulted), or living in a racially gerryman-\ndered electoral district? These injuries are no more con-\ncrete than seeing one\u2019s tax dollars spent on religion, but\nwe have recognized each one as enough for standing. See\nFriends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services\n(TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 183 (2000) (esthetic injury);\nNortheastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of\nAmerica v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S. 656, 666 (1993) (\u201c[T]he\n\u2018injury in fact\u2019 is the inability to compete on an equal\nfooting in the bidding process, not the loss of a contract\u201d);\nUnited States v. Hays, 515 U. S. 737, 744\u2013745 (1995)\n(living in a racially gerrymandered electoral district). This\nis not to say that any sort of alleged injury will satisfy\nArticle III, but only that intangible harms must be evalu-\nated case by case.4\n    Thus, Flast speaks for this Court\u2019s recognition (shared\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Although the plurality makes much of the fact that the injury in this\ncase is \u201cgeneralized,\u201d ante, at 8, and shared with the \u201cpublic-at-large,\u201d\nante, at 9, those properties on their own do not strip a would-be plain-\ntiff of standing. See Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Akins, 524 U. S. 11, 24\n(1998) (\u201cOften the fact that an interest is abstract and the fact that it is\nwidely shared go hand in hand. But their association is not invariable,\nand where a harm is concrete, though widely shared, the Court has\nfound \u2018injury in fact\u2019 \u201d).\n   4 Outside the Establishment Clause context, as the plurality points\n\nout, we have not found the injury to a taxpayer when funds are improp-\nerly expended to suffice for standing. See ante, at 19 (citing examples).\n                     Cite as: 551 U.

The judgment of suffi-\ncient injury takes account of the Madisonian relationship\nof tax money and conscience, but it equally reflects the\nFounders\u2019 pragmatic \u201cconviction that individual religious\nliberty could be achieved best under a government which\nwas stripped of all power to tax, to support, or otherwise to\nassist any or all religions,\u201d Everson v.

Under <i>Flast,</i> a plaintiff asserting an Establishment Clause claim has standing to challenge a law authorizing the use of federal funds in a way that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause. In the present case, Congress did not specifically authorize the use of federal funds to pay for the conferences or speeches that the plaintiffs challenged. Instead, the conferences and speeches were paid for out of general Executive Branch appropriations. The Court of Appeals, however, held that the plaintiffs have standing as taxpayers because the conferences were paid for with money appropriated by Congress.</p>\n<p>The question that is presented here is whether this broad reading of <i>Flast</i> is correct. We hold that it is not. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In 2001, the President issued an executive order creating the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives within the Executive Office of the President. Exec. Order No. 13199, 3 CFR 752 (2001 Comp.). The purpose of this new office was to ensure that \"private and charitable community groups, including religious ones ... have the fullest opportunity permitted by law to compete on a level playing field, so long as they achieve valid public purposes\" and adhere to \"the bedrock principles of pluralism, nondiscrimination, evenhandedness, and neutrality.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The office was specifically charged with the task of eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic, legislative, and regulatory barriers that could impede such organizations' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2560</span> effectiveness and ability to compete equally for federal assistance. <i>Id.,</i> at 752-753.</p>\n<p>By separate executive orders, the President also created Executive Department Centers for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives within several federal agencies and departments.<sup>[1]</sup> These centers were given the job of ensuring that faith-based community groups would be eligible to compete for federal financial support without impairing their independence or autonomy, as long as they did \"not use direct Federal financial assistance to support any inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization.\" Exec. Order No. 13279, 3 CFR \u00a7 2(f), p. 260 (2002 Comp.). To this end, the President directed that \"[n]o organization should be discriminated against on the basis of religion or religious belief in the administration or distribution of Federal financial assistance under social service programs,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 2(c), at 260, and that \"[a]ll organizations that receive Federal financial assistance under social services programs should be prohibited from discriminating against beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries of the social services programs on the basis of religion or religious belief,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 2(d), at 260. Petitioners, who have been sued in their official capacities, are the directors of the White House Office and various Executive Department Centers.</p>\n<p>No congressional legislation specifically authorized the creation of the White House Office or the Executive Department Centers. Rather, they were \"created entirely within the executive branch ... by Presidential executive order.\" <i>Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc. v. Chao,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792876\"><a href=\"/opinion/792876/freedom-from-religion-foundation-inc-v-elaine-l-ch/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>, 997 (C.A.7 2006). Nor has Congress enacted any law specifically appropriating money for these entities' activities. Instead, their activities are funded through general Executive Branch appropriations. For example, the Department of Education's Center is funded from money appropriated for the Office of the Secretary of Education, while the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Center is funded through that Department's salaries and expenses account.

Respondents brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, alleging that petitioners violated the Establishment Clause by organizing conferences at which faith-based organizations allegedly \"are singled out as being particularly worthy of federal funding..., and the belief in God is extolled as distinguishing the claimed effectiveness of faith-based social services.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 32, App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a. Respondents further alleged that the content of these conferences sent a message to religious believers \"that they are insiders and favored members <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2561</span> of the political community\" and that the conferences sent the message to nonbelievers \"that they are outsiders\" and \"not full members of the political community.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 37, App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a. In short, respondents alleged that the conferences were designed to promote, and had the effect of promoting, religious community groups over secular ones.</p>\n<p>The only asserted basis for standing was that the individual respondents are federal taxpayers who are \"opposed to the use of Congressional taxpayer appropriations to advance and promote religion.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 10, App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a; see also <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 7-9, App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a-69a. In their capacity as federal taxpayers, respondents sought to challenge Executive Branch expenditures for these conferences, which, they contended, violated the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The District Court dismissed the claims against petitioners for lack of standing. See <i>Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc. v. Towey,</i> No. 04-C-381-S (WD Wis., Nov. 15, 2004), App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a-35a.

Because petitioners in this case acted \"at the President's request and on the President's behalf\" and were not \"charged with the administration of a congressional program,\" the District Court concluded that the challenged activities were \"not `exercises of congressional power'\" sufficient to provide a basis for taxpayer standing under <i>Flast.</i> App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a-34a.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792876\"><a href=\"/opinion/792876/freedom-from-religion-foundation-inc-v-elaine-l-ch/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>. The majority read <i>Flast</i> as granting federal taxpayers standing to challenge Executive Branch programs on Establishment Clause grounds so long as the activities are \"financed by a congressional appropriation.\" 433 F.3d, at 997. This was the case, the majority concluded, even where \"there is no statutory program\" enacted by Congress and the funds are \"from appropriations for the general administrative expenses, over which the President and other executive branch officials have a degree of discretionary power.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 994. According to the majority, a taxpayer has standing to challenge anything done by a federal agency or officer so long as \"the marginal or incremental cost to the tax-paying public of the alleged violation of the establishment clause\" is greater than \"zero.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 995.</p>\n<p>In dissent, Judge Ripple opined that the majority's decision reflected a \"dramatic expansion of current standing doctrine,\" <i>id.,</i> at 997, that \"cuts the concept of taxpayer standing loose from its moorings,\" <i>id.,</i> at 998. Noting that \"[t]he executive can do nothing without general budget appropriations from Congress,\" <i>id.,</i> at 1000, he criticized the majority for overstepping <i>Flast's</i> requirement that a \"plaintiff must bring an attack against a disbursement of public funds made in the exercise of <i>Congress'</i> taxing and spending power,\" 433 F.3d, at 1000 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals denied en banc review by a vote of seven to four. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794313\"><a href=\"/opinion/794313/freedom-from-religion-foundation-inc-v-elaine-l-ch/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span> (C.A.7 2006).

Of course, a taxpayer has standing to challenge the <i>collection</i> of a specific tax assessment as unconstitutional; being forced to pay such a tax causes a real and immediate economic injury to the individual taxpayer. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Follett v. Town of McCormick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103956\"><a href=\"/opinion/103956/follett-v-town-of-mccormick/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>, 64 S.Ct. 717, 88 L.Ed. 938 (1944) (invalidating tax on preaching on First Amendment grounds). But that is not the interest on which respondents assert standing here. Rather, their claim is that, having paid lawfully collected taxes into the Federal Treasury at some point, they have a continuing, legally cognizable interest in ensuring that those funds are not <i>used</i> by the Government in a way that violates the Constitution.</p>\n<p>We have consistently held that this type of interest is too generalized and attenuated to support Article III standing. In <i>Frothingham,</i> a federal taxpayer sought to challenge federal appropriations for mothers' and children's health, arguing that federal involvement in this area intruded on the rights reserved to the States under the Tenth Amendment and would \"increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take [the plaintiff's] property without due process of law.\" 262 U.S., at 486, 43 S.Ct. 597. We concluded that the plaintiff lacked the kind of particularized injury required for Article III standing:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[I]nterest in the moneys of the Treasury... is shared with millions of others; is comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The administration of any statute, likely to produce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of taxpayers, the extent of whose several liability is indefinite and constantly changing, is essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 487, 43 S.Ct. 597.</blockquote>\n<p>Because the interests of the taxpayer are, in essence, the interests of the public-at-large, deciding a constitutional claim based solely on taxpayer standing \"would be[,] not to decide a judicial controversy, but to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department, an authority which plainly we do not possess.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 489, 43 S.Ct. 597; see also <i>Alabama Power Co. v.

In so doing, we gave effect to the basic constitutional principle that</p>\n<blockquote>\"a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about government\u0097 claiming only harm to his and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2564</span> benefits him than it does the public at large\u0097does not state an Article III case or controversy.\" <i>Lujan v.

The taxpayer-plaintiff in that case challenged the distribution of federal funds to religious schools under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, alleging that such aid violated the Establishment Clause. The Court set out a two-part test for determining whether a federal taxpayer has standing to challenge an allegedly unconstitutional expenditure:</p>\n<blockquote>\"First, the taxpayer must establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative enactment attacked. Thus, a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, \u00a7 8, of the Constitution. It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute .... Secondly, the taxpayer must establish a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged. Under this requirement, the taxpayer must show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art. I, \u00a7 8.\" <i>Flast,</i> 392 U.S., at 102-103, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</blockquote>\n<p>The Court held that the taxpayer-plaintiff in <i>Flast</i> had satisfied both prongs of this test: The plaintiff's \"constitutional challenge [was] made to an exercise by Congress of its power under Art. I, \u00a7 8, to spend for the general welfare,\" and she <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2565</span> alleged a violation of the Establishment Clause, which \"operates as a specific constitutional limitation upon the exercise by Congress of the taxing and spending power conferred by Art. I, \u00a7 8.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 103-104, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Respondents argue that this case falls within the <i>Flast</i> exception, which they read to cover any \"expenditure of government funds in violation of the Establishment Clause.\" Brief for Respondents 12. But this broad reading fails to observe \"the rigor with which the <i>Flast</i> exception to the <i>Frothingham</i> principle ought to be applied.\" <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S., at 481, 102 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n<p>The expenditures at issue in <i>Flast</i> were made pursuant to an express congressional mandate and a specific congressional appropriation. The plaintiff in that case challenged disbursements made under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 27. That Act expressly appropriated the sum of $100 million for fiscal year 1966, \u00a7 201(b), <i>id.,</i> at 36, and authorized the disbursement of those funds to local educational agencies for the education of low-income students, see <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 86, 88 S.Ct. 1942. The Act mandated that local educational agencies receiving such funds \"ma[k]e provision for including special educational services and arrangements (such as dual enrollment, educational radio and television, and mobile educational services and equipment)\" in which students enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools could participate, \u00a7 2, 79 Stat. 30-31. In addition, recipient agencies were required to ensure that \"library resources, textbooks, and other instructional materials\" funded through the grants \"be provided on an equitable basis for the use of children and teachers in private elementary and secondary schools,\" \u00a7 203(a)(3)(B), <i>id.,</i> at 37.</p>\n<p>The expenditures challenged in <i>Flast,</i> then, were funded by a specific congressional appropriation and were disbursed to private schools (including religiously affiliated schools) pursuant to a direct and unambiguous congressional mandate.<sup>[3]</sup> Indeed, the <i>Flast</i> taxpayer-plaintiff's constitutional claim was premised on the contention that if the Government's actions were \"`within the authority and intent of the Act, the Act is to that extent unconstitutional and void.'\" <i>Flast,</i> 392 U.S., at 90, 88 S.Ct. 1942. And the judgment reviewed by this Court in <i>Flast</i> solely concerned the question whether \"if [the challenged] expenditures are authorized by the Act the statute constitutes a `law respecting an establishment of religion' and law `prohibiting the free exercise thereof'\" under the First Amendment. <i>Flast v. Gardner,</i> 271 F.Supp. 1, 2 (S.D.N.Y. 1967).</p>\n<p>Given that the alleged Establishment Clause violation in <i>Flast</i> was funded by a specific congressional appropriation and was undertaken pursuant to an express congressional mandate, the Court concluded that the taxpayer-plaintiffs had established the requisite \"logical link between [their taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.\" In the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2566</span> Court's words, \"[t]heir constitutional challenge [was] made to an exercise by Congress of its power under Art. I, \u00a7 8, to spend for the general welfare.\" 392 U.S., at 90, 88 S.Ct. 1942. But as this Court later noted, <i>Flast</i> \"limited taxpayer standing to challenges directed `only [at] exercises of congressional power'\" under the Taxing and Spending Clause. <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S., at 479, 102 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The link between congressional action and constitutional violation that supported taxpayer standing in <i>Flast</i> is missing here. Respondents do not challenge any specific congressional action or appropriation; nor do they ask the Court to invalidate any congressional enactment or legislatively created program as unconstitutional. That is because the expenditures at issue here were not made pursuant to any Act of Congress. Rather, Congress provided general appropriations to the Executive Branch to fund its day-to-day activities.<sup>[4]</sup> These appropriations did not expressly authorize, direct, or even mention the expenditures of which respondents complain. Those expenditures resulted from executive discretion, not congressional action.</p>\n<p>We have never found taxpayer standing under such circumstances. In <i>Valley Forge,</i> we held that a taxpayer lacked standing to challenge \"a decision by [the federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare] to transfer a parcel of federal property\" to a religious college because this transfer was \"not a congressional action.\" 454 U.S., at 479, 102 S.Ct. 752. In fact, the connection to congressional action was closer in <i>Valley Forge</i> than it is here, because in that case, the \"particular Executive Branch action\" being challenged was at least \"arguably authorized\" by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, which permitted federal agencies to transfer surplus property to private entities. <i>Id.,</i> at 479, n. 15, 102 S.Ct. 752. Nevertheless, we found that the plaintiffs lacked standing because <i>Flast</i> \"limited taxpayer standing to challenges directed `only [at] exercises of congressional power'\" under the Taxing and Spending Clause. 454 U.S., at 479, 102 S.Ct. 752 (quoting <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Similarly, in <i>Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109087\"><a href=\"/opinion/109087/schlesinger-v-reservists-comm-to-stop-the-war/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974), the taxpayer-plaintiffs contended that the Incompatibility Clause of Article I prohibited Members of Congress from holding commissions in the Armed Forces Reserve. We held that these plaintiffs lacked standing under <i>Flast</i> because they \"did not challenge an enactment under Art. I, \u00a7 8, but rather the action of the Executive Branch in permitting Members of Congress to maintain their Reserve status.\" 418 U.S., at 228, 94 S.Ct. 2925. This was the case even though the plaintiffs sought to reclaim reservist pay received by those Members\u0097pay that presumably was funded through Congress' general appropriations for the support of the Armed Forces: \"Such relief would follow from the invalidity of Executive action in paying persons who could not lawfully have been reservists, not from the invalidity of the statutes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2567</span> authorizing pay to those who lawfully were Reservists.\" <i>Ibid.,</i> n. 17. See also <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109086\"><a href=\"/opinion/109086/united-states-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span>, 175, 94 S.Ct. 2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974) (denying taxpayers standing to compel publication of accounting for the Central Intelligence Agency because \"there is no `logical nexus' between the asserted status of taxpayer and the claimed failure of the Congress to require the Executive to supply a more detailed report of the expenditures of that agency\").</p>\n<p><i>Bowen v. Kendrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112138\"><a href=\"/opinion/112138/bowen-v-kendrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span>, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988), on which respondents rely heavily, is not to the contrary. In that case, we held that the taxpayer-plaintiffs had standing to mount an as-applied challenge to the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA), which authorized federal grants to private community service groups including religious organizations. The Court found \"a sufficient nexus between the taxpayer's standing as a taxpayer and the congressional exercise of taxing and spending power,\" notwithstanding the fact that the \"the funding authorized by Congress ha[d] flowed through and been administered\" by an Executive Branch official. <i>Id.,</i> at 620, 619, 108 S.Ct. 2562.</p>\n<p>But the key to that conclusion was the Court's recognition that AFLA was \"at heart a program of disbursement of funds pursuant to Congress' taxing and spending powers,\" and that the plaintiffs' claims \"call[ed] into question how the funds authorized by Congress [were] being disbursed <i>pursuant to the AFLA's statutory mandate.\" Id.,</i> at 619-620, 108 S.Ct. 2562 (emphasis added). AFLA not only expressly authorized and appropriated specific funds for grant-making, it also expressly contemplated that some of those moneys might go to projects involving religious groups. See <i>id.,</i> at 595-596, 108 S.Ct. 2562; see also <i>id.,</i> at 623, 108 S.Ct. 2562 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting the \"partnership between governmental and religious institutions contemplated by the AFLA\").<sup>[6]</sup> Unlike this case, <i>Kendrick</i> involved a \"program of disbursement of funds pursuant to Congress' taxing and spending powers\" that \"Congress had created,\" \"authorized,\" and \"mandate[d].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 619-620, 108 S.Ct. 2562.</p>\n<p>Respondents attempt to paint their lawsuit as a <i>Kendrick</i>-style as-applied challenge, but this effort is unavailing for the simple reason that they can cite no statute whose application they challenge. The best they can do is to point to unspecified, lump-sum \"Congressional budget appropriations\" for the general use of the Executive Branch\u0097the allocation of which \"is a[n] administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion.\" <i>Lincoln v. Vigil,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112864\"><a href=\"/opinion/112864/lincoln-v-vigil/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 192, 113 S.Ct. 2024, 124 L.Ed.2d 101 (1993). Characterizing this case as an \"as-applied challenge\" to these general appropriations statutes would stretch the meaning of that term past its breaking point. It cannot be that every legal challenge to a discretionary Executive Branch action implicates the constitutionality of the underlying congressional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2568</span> appropriation. When a criminal defendant charges that a federal agent carried out an unreasonable search or seizure, we do not view that claim as an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of the statute appropriating funds for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Respondents have not established why the discretionary Executive Branch expenditures here, which are similarly funded by no-strings, lump-sum appropriations, should be viewed any differently.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In short, this case falls outside the \"the narrow exception\" that <i>Flast</i> \"created to the general rule against taxpayer standing established in <i>Frothingham.\" </i><i>Kendrick, supra,</i> at 618, 108 S.Ct. 2562. Because the expenditures that respondents challenge were not expressly authorized or mandated by any specific congressional enactment, respondents' lawsuit is not directed at an exercise of congressional power, see <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S., at 479, 102 S.Ct. 752, and thus lacks the requisite \"logical nexus\" between taxpayer status \"and the type of legislative enactment attacked.\" <i>Flast,</i> 392 U.S., at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Respondents argue that it is \"arbitrary\" to distinguish between money spent pursuant to congressional mandate and expenditures made in the course of executive discretion, because \"the injury to taxpayers in both situations is the very injury targeted by the Establishment Clause and <i>Flast</i>\u0097 the expenditure for the support of religion of funds exacted from taxpayers.\" Brief for Respondents 13. The panel majority below agreed, based on its observation that \"there is so much that executive officials could do to promote religion in ways forbidden by the establishment clause.\" 433 F.3d, at 995.</p>\n<p>But <i>Flast</i> focused on congressional action, and we must decline this invitation to extend its holding to encompass discretionary Executive Branch expenditures. <i>Flast</i> itself distinguished the \"incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute,\" <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, and we have subsequently rejected the view that taxpayer standing \"extends to `the Government as a whole, regardless of which branch is at work in a particular instance,'\" <i>Valley Forge, supra,</i> at 484, n. 20, 102 S.Ct. 752. Moreover, we have repeatedly emphasized that the <i>Flast</i> exception has a \"narrow application in our precedent,\" <i>Cuno,</i> 547 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1865, that only \"slightly lowered\" the bar on taxpayer standing, <i>Richardson,</i> 418 U.S., at 173, 94 S.Ct. 2940, and that must be applied with \"rigor,\" <i>Valley Forge, supra,</i> at 481, 102 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n<p>It is significant that, in the four decades since its creation, the <i>Flast</i> exception has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2569</span> largely been confined to its facts. We have declined to lower the taxpayer standing bar in suits alleging violations of any constitutional provision apart from the Establishment Clause. See <i>Tilton v. Richardson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108381\"><a href=\"/opinion/108381/tilton-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span>, 91 S.Ct. 2091, 29 L.Ed.2d 790 (1971) (no taxpayer standing to sue under Free Exercise Clause of First Amendment); <i>Richardson,</i> 418 U.S., at 175, 94 S.Ct. 2940 (no taxpayer standing to sue under Statement and Account Clause of Art.

I); <i>Cuno, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1865 (no taxpayer standing to sue under Commerce Clause). We have similarly refused to extend <i>Flast</i> to permit taxpayer standing for Establishment Clause challenges that do not implicate Congress' taxing and spending power. See <i>Valley Forge, supra,</i> at 479-482, 102 S.Ct. 752 (no taxpayer standing to challenge Executive Branch action taken pursuant to Property Clause of Art.

In effect, we have adopted the position set forth by Justice Powell in his concurrence in <i>Richardson</i> and have \"limit[ed] the expansion of federal taxpayer and citizen standing in the absence of specific statutory authorization to an outer boundary drawn by the <i>results</i> in <i>Flast</i> ....\" 418 U.S., at 196, 94 S.Ct. 2940.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>While respondents argue that Executive Branch expenditures in support of religion are no different from legislative extractions, <i>Flast</i> itself rejected this equivalence: \"It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute.\" 392 U.S., at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p>Because almost all Executive Branch activity is ultimately funded by some congressional appropriation, extending the <i>Flast</i> exception to purely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal action\u0097be it a conference, proclamation or speech\u0097to Establishment Clause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court. To see the wide swathe of activity that respondents' proposed rule would cover, one need look no further than the amended complaint in this action, which focuses largely on speeches and presentations made by Executive Branch officials. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Amended Complaint \u00b6 32, App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a (challenging Executive Branch officials' \"support of national and regional conferences\"); <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 33, App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a-75a (challenging content of speech by Secretary of Education); <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 35, 36, App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a (challenging content of Presidential speeches); <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 41, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a (challenging Executive Branch officials' \"public appearances\" and \"speeches\"). Such a broad reading would ignore the first prong of <i>Flast's</i> standing test, which requires \"a logical link between [taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.\" 392 U.S., at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p>It would also raise serious separation-of-powers concerns. As we have recognized, <i>Flast</i> itself gave too little weight to these concerns. By framing the standing question solely in terms of whether the dispute would be presented in an adversary context and in a form traditionally viewed as capable of judicial resolution, <i>Flast</i> \"failed to recognize that this doctrine has a separation-of-powers component, which keeps courts within certain traditional bounds vis-\u00e1-vis the other branches, concrete adverseness or not.\" <i>Lewis v.

The rule respondents propose would enlist the federal courts to superintend, at the behest of any federal taxpayer, the speeches, statements, and myriad daily activities of the President, his staff, and other Executive Branch officials. This would \"be quite at odds with ... <i>Flast's</i> own promise that it would not transform federal courts into forums for taxpayers' `generalized grievances'\" about the conduct of government, <i>Cuno,</i> 547 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1865 (quoting <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 106, 88 S.Ct. 1942), and would \"open the Judiciary to an arguable charge of providing `government by injunction,'\" <i>Schlesinger,</i> 418 U.S., at 222, 94 S.Ct. 2925. It would deputize federal courts as \"`virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of Executive action,'\" and that, most emphatically, \"is not the role of the judiciary.\" <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S., at 760, 104 S.Ct. 3315 (quoting <i>Laird v. Tatum,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108595\"><a href=\"/opinion/108595/laird-v-tatum/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 15, 92 S.Ct. 2318, 33 L.Ed.2d 154 (1972)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Both the Court of Appeals and respondents implicitly recognize that unqualified federal taxpayer standing to assert Establishment Clause claims would go too far, but neither the Court of Appeals nor respondents has identified a workable limitation. The Court of Appeals, as noted, conceded only that a taxpayer would lack standing where \"the marginal or incremental cost to the taxpaying public of the alleged violation of the establishment clause\" is \"zero.\" 433 F.3d, at 995. Applying this rule, the Court of Appeals opined that a taxpayer would not have standing to challenge a President's favorable reference to religion in a State of the Union address because the costs associated with the speech \"would be no greater merely because the President had mentioned Moses rather than John Stuart Mill.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>There is reason to question whether the Court of Appeals' intended for its zero-marginal-cost test to be taken literally, because the court, without any apparent inquiry into the costs of Secretary Paige's speech, went on to agree that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge that speech. <i>Id.,</i> at 996. But if we take the Court of Appeals' test literally\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> that any marginal cost greater than zero suffices\u0097taxpayers might well have standing to challenge some (and perhaps many) speeches. As Judge Easterbrook observed: \"The total cost of presidential proclamations and speeches by Cabinet officers that touch on religion (Thanksgiving and several other holidays) surely exceeds $500,000 annually; it may cost that much to use Air Force One and send a Secret Service detail to a single speaking engagement.\" 447 F.3d, at 989-990 (concurring in denial of rehearing en banc). At a minimum, the Court of Appeals' approach (asking whether the marginal cost exceeded zero) would surely create difficult and uncomfortable line-drawing problems. Suppose that it is alleged that a speech writer or other staff member spent extra time doing research <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2571</span> for the purpose of including \"religious imagery\" in a speech. Suppose that a President or a Cabinet officer attends or speaks at a prayer breakfast and that the time spent was time that would have otherwise been spent on secular work.</p>\n<p>Respondents take a somewhat different approach, contending that their proposed expansion of <i>Flast</i> would be manageable because they would require that a challenged expenditure be \"fairly traceable to the conduct alleged to violate the Establishment Clause.\" Brief for Respondents 17. Applying this test, they argue, would \"scree[n] out ... challenge[s to] the content of one particular speech, for example the State of the Union address, as an Establishment Clause violation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 21.</p>\n<p>We find little comfort in this vague and ill-defined test. As an initial matter, respondents fail to explain why the (often substantial) costs that attend, for example, a Presidential address are any less \"traceable\" than the expenses related to the Executive Branch statements and conferences at issue here. Indeed, respondents concede that even lawsuits involving <i>de minimis</i> amounts of taxpayer money can pass their proposed \"traceability\" test. <i>Id.,</i> at 20, n. 6.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the \"traceability\" inquiry, depending on how it is framed, would appear to prove either too little or too much. If the question is whether an allegedly unconstitutional executive action can somehow be traced to taxpayer funds <i>in general,</i> the answer will always be yes: Almost all Executive Branch activities are ultimately funded by <i>some</i> congressional appropriation, whether general or specific, which is in turn financed by tax receipts. If, on the other hand, the question is whether the challenged action can be traced to the contributions of a <i>particular</i> taxpayer-plaintiff, the answer will almost always be no: As we recognized in <i>Frothingham,</i> the interest of any individual taxpayer in a particular federal expenditure \"is comparatively minute and indeterminable... and constantly changing.\" 262 U.S., at 487, 43 S.Ct. 597.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondents set out a parade of horribles that they claim could occur if <i>Flast</i> is not extended to discretionary Executive Branch expenditures. For example, they say, a federal agency could use its discretionary funds to build a house of worship or to hire clergy of one denomination and send them out to spread their faith. Or an agency could use its funds to make bulk purchases of Stars of David, crucifixes, or depictions of the star and crescent for use in its offices or for distribution to the employees or the general public. Of course, none of these things has happened, even though <i>Flast</i> has not previously been expanded in the way that respondents urge. In the unlikely event that any of these executive actions did take place, Congress could quickly step in. And respondents make no effort to show that these improbable abuses could not be challenged in federal court by plaintiffs who would possess standing based on grounds other than taxpayer standing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Over the years, <i>Flast</i> has been defended by some and criticized by others. But the present case does not require us to reconsider that precedent. The Court of Appeals did not apply <i>Flast</i>; it extended <i>Flast.</i> It is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic. That was the approach that then-Justice Rehnquist took in his opinion for the Court in <i>Valley Forge,</i> and it is the approach we take here. We do not extend <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2572</span> <i>Flast,</i> but we also do not overrule it. We leave <i>Flast</i> as we found it.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA says that we must either overrule <i>Flast</i> or extend it to the limits of its logic. His position is not \"[in]sane,\" inconsistent with the \"rule of law,\" or \"utterly meaningless.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2573-2574 (opinion concurring in judgment). But it is wrong. Justice SCALIA does not seriously dispute either (1) that <i>Flast</i> itself spoke in terms of \"legislative enactment[s]\" and \"exercises of congressional power,\" 392 U.S., at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, or (2) that in the four decades since <i>Flast</i> was decided, we have never extended its narrow exception to a purely discretionary Executive Branch expenditure. We need go no further to decide this case. Relying on the provision of the Constitution that limits our role to resolving the \"Cases\" and \"Controversies\" before us, we decide only the case at hand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, concurring.</p>\n<p>The separation-of-powers design in the Constitution is implemented, among other means, by Article III's case-or-controversy limitation and the resulting requirement of standing. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 559-560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). The Court's decision in <i>Flast v. Cohen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107731\"><a href=\"/opinion/107731/flast-v-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), and in later cases applying it, must be interpreted as respecting separation-of-powers principles but acknowledging as well that these principles, in some cases, must accommodate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. The clause expresses the Constitution's special concern that freedom of conscience not be compromised by government taxing and spending in support of religion. In my view the result reached in <i>Flast</i> is correct and should not be called into question. For the reasons set forth by Justice ALITO, however, <i>Flast</i> should not be extended to permit taxpayer standing in the instant matter. And I join his opinion in full.</p>\n<p>Respondents' amended complaint challenged the religious nature of national and regional conferences that promoted President Bush's Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a-77a. To support the allegation respondents pointed to speeches given by the President and other executive officers, speeches with religious references. <i>Id.,</i> at 73a-76a. The complaint relies on respondents' taxpayer status as the sole basis for standing to maintain the suit but points to no specific use of Congress' taxing and spending power other than general appropriations to fund the administration of the Executive Branch. <i>Id.,</i> at 71a-73a.</p>\n<p><i>Flast</i> established a \"narrow exception\" to the rule against taxpayer standing. <i>Bowen v. Kendrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112138\"><a href=\"/opinion/112138/bowen-v-kendrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span>, 618, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988). To find standing in the circumstances of this case would make the narrow exception boundless. The public events and public speeches respondents seek to call in question are part of the open discussion essential to democratic self-government. The Executive Branch should be free, as a general matter, to discover new ideas, to understand pressing public demands, and to find creative responses to address governmental concerns. The exchange of ideas between and among the State and Federal Governments and their manifold, diverse constituencies sustains a free society. Permitting any and all taxpayers to challenge the content of these prototypical executive operations and dialogues would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2573</span> lead to judicial intervention so far exceeding traditional boundaries on the Judiciary that there would arise a real danger of judicial oversight of executive duties. The burden of discovery to ascertain if relief is justified in these potentially innumerable cases would risk altering the free exchange of ideas and information. And were this constant supervision to take place the courts would soon assume the role of speech editors for communications issued by executive officials and event planners for meetings they hold.</p>\n<p>The courts must be reluctant to expand their authority by requiring intrusive and unremitting judicial management of the way the Executive Branch performs its duties. The Court has refused to establish a constitutional rule that would require or allow \"permanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental operations to a degree inconsistent with sound principles of federalism and the separation of powers.\" <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 1961, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006); see also <i>Cheney v. United States Dist. Court for D.C.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136997\"><a href=\"/opinion/136997/cheney-v-united-states-dist-court-for-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, 382, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004) (noting that \"separation-of-powers considerations should inform a court of appeals' evaluation of a mandamus petition involving the President or the Vice President\" and that \"mandamus standards are broad enough... to prevent a lower court from interfering with a coequal branch's ability to discharge its constitutional responsibilities\"). In the Article III context the Court explained that concerns based on separation of powers \"counsel[ed] against recognizing standing in a case brought ... to seek a restructuring of the apparatus established by the Executive Branch to fulfill its legal duties.\" <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111258\"><a href=\"/opinion/111258/allen-v-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span>, 761, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).</p>\n<p>The same principle applies here. The Court should not authorize the constant intrusion upon the executive realm that would result from granting taxpayer standing in the instant case. As JUSTICE ALITO explains in detail, the Court's precedents do not require it to do so. The separation-of-powers concerns implicated by intrusive judicial regulation of day-to-day executive operations reinforce his interpretation of <i>Flast's</i> framework. Cf. <i>Allen, supra,</i> at 761, n. 26, 104 S.Ct. 3315 (relying \"on separation of powers principles to interpret the `fairly traceable' component of the standing requirement\").</p>\n<p>It must be remembered that, even where parties have no standing to sue, members of the Legislative and Executive Branches are not excused from making constitutional determinations in the regular course of their duties. Government officials must make a conscious decision to obey the Constitution whether or not their acts can be challenged in a court of law and then must conform their actions to these principled determinations.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Today's opinion is, in one significant respect, entirely consistent with our previous cases addressing taxpayer standing to raise Establishment Clause challenges to government expenditures. Unfortunately, the consistency lies in the creation of utterly meaningless distinctions which separate the case at hand from the precedents that have come out differently, but which cannot possibly be (in any sane world) the reason it comes out differently. If this Court is to decide cases by rule of law rather than show of hands, we must surrender to logic and choose sides: Either <i>Flast v. Cohen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107731\"><a href=\"/opinion/107731/flast-v-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), should be applied to (at a minimum) <i>all</i> challenges to the governmental expenditure of general tax revenues <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2574</span> in a manner alleged to violate a constitutional provision specifically limiting the taxing and spending power, or <i>Flast</i> should be repudiated. For me, the choice is easy. <i>Flast</i> is wholly irreconcilable with the Article III restrictions on federal-court jurisdiction that this Court has repeatedly confirmed are embodied in the doctrine of standing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>There is a simple reason why our taxpayer-standing cases involving Establishment Clause challenges to government expenditures are notoriously inconsistent: We have inconsistently described the first element of the \"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,\" which minimum consists of (1) a \"concrete and particularized\" \"`injury in fact'\" that is (2) fairly traceable to the defendant's alleged unlawful conduct and (3) likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. See <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). We have alternately relied on two entirely distinct conceptions of injury in fact, which for convenience I will call \"Wallet Injury\" and \"Psychic Injury.\"</p>\n<p>Wallet Injury is the type of concrete and particularized injury one would expect to be asserted in a <i>taxpayer</i> suit, namely, a claim that the plaintiff's tax liability is higher than it would be, but for the allegedly unlawful government action. The stumbling block for suits challenging government expenditures based on this conventional type of injury is quite predictable. The plaintiff cannot satisfy the traceability and redressability prongs of standing. It is uncertain what the plaintiff's tax bill would have been had the allegedly forbidden expenditure not been made, and it is even more speculative whether the government will, in response to an adverse court decision, lower taxes rather than spend the funds in some other manner.</p>\n<p>Psychic Injury, on the other hand, has nothing to do with the plaintiff's tax liability. Instead, the injury consists of the taxpayer's <i>mental displeasure</i> that money extracted from him is being spent in an unlawful manner. This shift in focus eliminates traceability and redressability problems. Psychic Injury is directly traceable to the improper <i>use</i> of taxpayer funds, and it is redressed when the improper use is enjoined, regardless of whether that injunction affects the taxpayer's purse. <i>Flast</i> and the cases following its teaching have invoked a peculiarly restricted version of Psychic Injury, permitting taxpayer displeasure over unconstitutional spending to support standing <i>only if</i> the constitutional provision allegedly violated is a specific limitation on the taxing and spending power. Restricted or not, this conceptualizing of injury in fact in purely mental terms conflicts squarely with the familiar proposition that a plaintiff lacks a concrete and particularized injury when his only complaint is the generalized grievance that the law is being violated. As we reaffirmed unanimously just this Term: \"`We have consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about government\u0097claiming only harm to his and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large\u0097does not state an Article III case or controversy.'\" <i>Lance v. Coffman,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1194, 1196, 167 L.Ed.2d 29 (2007) <i>(per curiam)</i> (quoting <i>Lujan, supra,</i> at 573-574, 112 S.Ct. 2130).</p>\n<p>As the following review of our cases demonstrates, we initially denied taxpayer standing based on Wallet Injury, but then <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2575</span> found standing in some later cases based on the limited version of Psychic Injury described above. The basic logical flaw in our cases is thus twofold: We have never explained why Psychic Injury was insufficient in the cases in which standing was denied, and we have never explained why Psychic Injury, however limited, is cognizable under Article III.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Two pre-<i>Flast</i> cases are of critical importance. In <i>Frothingham v. Mellon,</i> decided with <i>Massachusetts v. Mellon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100240\"><a href=\"/opinion/100240/massachusetts-v-mellon/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span>, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923), the taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of the Maternity Act of 1921, alleging in part that the federal funding provided by the Act was not authorized by any provision of the Constitution. See <i>id.,</i> at 476-477, 43 S.Ct. 597 (argument for Frothingham), 479-480 (opinion of the Court). The Court held that the taxpayer lacked standing. After emphasizing that \"the effect upon future taxation ... of any payment out of [Treasury] funds\" was \"remote, fluctuating and uncertain,\" <i>Frothingham,</i> 262 U.S., at 487, 43 S.Ct. 597, the Court concluded that \"[t]he party who invokes the power [of judicial review] must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally,\" <i>id.,</i> at 488, 43 S.Ct. 597. The Court was thus describing the traceability and redressability problems with Wallet Injury, and rejecting Psychic Injury as a generalized grievance rather than concrete and particularized harm.</p>\n<p>The second significant pre-<i>Flast</i> case is <i>Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104971\"><a href=\"/opinion/104971/doremus-v-board-of-ed-of-hawthorne/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span>, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952). There the taxpayers challenged under the Establishment Clause a state law requiring public-school teachers to read the Bible at the beginning of each school day. <i>Id.,</i> at 430, 433, 72 S.Ct. 394.<sup>[1]</sup> Relying extensively on <i>Frothingham,</i> the Court denied standing. After first emphasizing that there was no allegation that the Bible reading increased the plaintiffs' taxes or the cost of running the schools, 342 U.S., at 433, 72 S.Ct. 394, and then reaffirming that taxpayers must allege more than an indefinite injury suffered in common with people generally, <i>id.,</i> at 434, 72 S.Ct. 394, the Court concluded that the \"grievance which [the plaintiffs] sought to litigate here is not a direct dollars-and-cents injury but is a religious difference,\" <i>ibid.</i> In addition to reiterating <i>Frothingham's</i> description of the unavoidable obstacles to recovery under a taxpayer theory of Wallet Injury, <i>Doremus</i> rejected Psychic Injury in unmistakable terms. The opinion's deprecation of a mere \"religious difference,\" in contrast to a real \"dollars-and-cents injury,\" can only be understood as a flat denial of standing supported only by taxpayer disapproval of the unconstitutional use of tax funds. If the Court had thought that Psychic Injury was a permissible basis for standing, it should have sufficed (as the dissenting Justices in <i>Doremus</i> suggested, see 342 U.S., at 435, 72 S.Ct. 394 (opinion of Douglas, J.)) that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2576</span> public employees were being paid in part to violate the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Sixteen years after <i>Doremus,</i> the Court took a pivotal turn. In <i>Flast v. Cohen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107731\"><a href=\"/opinion/107731/flast-v-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), taxpayers challenged the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, alleging that funds expended pursuant to the Act were being used to support parochial schools. <i>Id.,</i> at 85-87, 88 S.Ct. 1942. They argued that either the Act itself proscribed such expenditures or that the Act violated the Establishment Clause. <i>Id.,</i> at 87, 90, 88 S.Ct. 1942. The Court held that the taxpayers had standing. Purportedly in order to determine whether taxpayers have the \"personal stake and interest\" necessary to satisfy Article III, a two-pronged nexus test was invented. <i>Id.,</i> at 101-102, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p>The first prong required the taxpayer to \"establish a logical link between [taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942. The Court described what that meant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[A] taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, \u00a7 8, of the Constitution. It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute. This requirement is consistent with the limitation imposed upon state-taxpayer standing in federal courts in <i>Doremus</i>....\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second prong required the taxpayer to \"establish a nexus between [taxpayer] status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Court elaborated that this required \"the taxpayer [to] show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art. I, \u00a7 8.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 102-103, 88 S.Ct. 1942. The Court held that the Establishment Clause was the type of specific limitation on the taxing and spending power that it had in mind because \"one of the specific evils feared by\" the Framers of that Clause was that the taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion over another or to support religion generally. <i>Id.,</i> at 103-104, 88 S.Ct. 1942 (relying exclusively upon Madison's famous Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments).</p>\n<p>Because both prongs of its newly minted two-part test were satisfied, <i>Flast</i> held that the taxpayers had standing. Wallet Injury could not possibly have been the basis for this conclusion, since the taxpayers in <i>Flast</i> were no more able to prove that success on the merits would reduce their tax burden than was the taxpayer in <i>Frothingham.</i> Thus, <i>Flast</i> relied on Psychic Injury to support standing, describing the \"injury\" as the taxpayer's allegation that \"his tax money is being extracted and spent in violation of specific constitutional protections against such abuses of legislative power.\" 392 U.S., at 106, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p>But that created a problem: If the taxpayers in <i>Flast</i> had standing based on Psychic Injury, and without regard to the effect of the litigation on their ultimate tax liability, why did not the taxpayers in <i>Doremus</i> and <i>Frothingham</i> have standing on a similar basis? Enter the magical two-pronged nexus test. It has often been pointed out, and never refuted, that the criteria in <i>Flast's</i> two-part test are <i>entirely unrelated</i> to the purported goal of ensuring that the plaintiff has a sufficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2577</span> \"stake in the outcome of the controversy.\" See <i>Flast,</i> 392 U.S., at 121-124, 88 S.Ct. 1942 (Harlan, J., dissenting); see also <i>id.,</i> at 107, 88 S.Ct. 1942 (Douglas, J., concurring); <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109086\"><a href=\"/opinion/109086/united-states-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span>, 183, 94 S.Ct. 2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring). In truth, the test was designed for a quite different goal. Each prong was meant to disqualify from standing one of the two prior cases that would otherwise contradict the holding of <i>Flast.</i> The first prong distinguished <i>Doremus</i> as involving a challenge to an \"incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute,\" rather than a challenge to a taxing and spending statute. See 392 U.S., at 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942. Did the Court proffer any reason why a taxpayer's Psychic Injury is less concrete and particularized, traceable, or redressable when the challenged expenditures are incidental to an essentially regulatory statute (whatever that means)? Not at all. <i>Doremus</i> had to be evaded, and so it was. In reality, of course, there is simply no material difference between <i>Flast</i> and <i>Doremus</i> as far as Psychic Injury is concerned: If taxpayers upset with the government's giving money to parochial schools had standing to sue, so should the taxpayers who disapproved of the government's paying public-school teachers to read the Bible.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Flast's</i> dispatching of <i>Frothingham</i> via the second prong of the nexus test was only marginally less disingenuous. Not only does the relationship of the allegedly violated provision to the taxing and spending power have no bearing upon the concreteness or particularity of the Psychic Injury, see Part III, <i>infra,</i> but the existence of that relationship does not even genuinely distinguish <i>Flast</i> from <i>Frothingham.</i> It is impossible to maintain that the Establishment Clause is a more direct limitation on the taxing and spending power than the constitutional limitation invoked in <i>Frothingham, which is contained within the very provision creating the power to tax and spend.</i> Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1, provides: \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes ..., to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence <i>and general Welfare</i> of the United States.\" (Emphasis added.) Though unmentioned in <i>Flast,</i> it was precisely this limitation upon the permissible purposes of taxing and spending upon which Mrs. Frothingham relied. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Appellant in <i>Frothingham,</i> O.T.1922, No. 962, p. 68 (\"[T]he words `provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States' are used <i>as limitations on the taxing power</i>\"); <i>id.,</i> at 26-81 (discussing the general welfare limitation at length).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Coherence and candor have fared no better in our later taxpayer-standing cases. The three of them containing lengthy discussion of the Establishment Clause warrant analysis.</p>\n<p><i>Flast</i> was dismissively and unpersuasively distinguished just 13 years later in <i>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2578</span> <i>United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982). The taxpayers there challenged the decision of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to give a 77-acre tract of Government property, worth over half a million dollars, to a religious organization. <i>Id.,</i> at 468, 102 S.Ct. 752. The Court, adhering to the strict letter of <i>Flast's</i> two-pronged nexus test, held that the taxpayers lacked standing. <i>Flast's</i> first prong was not satisfied: Rather than challenging a congressional taxing and spending statute, the plaintiffs were attacking an agency decision to transfer federal property pursuant to Congress's power under the Property Clause, Art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2. 454 U.S., at 479-480, 102 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n<p>In distinguishing between the Spending Clause and the Property Clause, <i>Valley Forge</i> achieved the seemingly impossible: It surpassed the high bar for irrationality set by <i>Flast's</i> distinguishing of <i>Doremus</i> and <i>Frothingham.</i> Like the dissenters in <i>Valley Forge,</i> see 454 U.S., at 511-512, 102 S.Ct. 752 (opinion of Brennan, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 513-514, 102 S.Ct. 752 (opinion of STEVENS, J.), I cannot fathom why Article III standing should turn on whether the government enables a religious organization to obtain real estate by giving it a check drawn from general tax revenues or instead by buying the property itself and then transferring title.</p>\n<p>While <i>Valley Forge's</i> application of the first prong to distinguish <i>Flast</i> was unpersuasive, the Court was at least not trying to hide the ball. Its holding was forthrightly based on a resounding rejection of the very concept of Psychic Injury:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Plaintiffs] fail to identify any personal injury suffered by them as a consequence of the alleged constitutional error, other than the psychological consequence presumably produced by observation of conduct with which one disagrees. That is not an injury sufficient to confer standing under Art. III, even though the disagreement is phrased in constitutional terms. It is evident that respondents are firmly committed to the constitutional principle of separation of church and State, but standing is not measured by the intensity of the litigant's interest or the fervor of his advocacy.\" 454 U.S., at 485-486, 102 S.Ct. 752 (emphasis omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, in keeping with what was to become the shameful tradition of our taxpayer-standing cases, the Court's candor about the inadequacy of Psychic Injury was combined with a notable silence as to why <i>Flast</i> itself was not doomed.</p>\n<p>A mere six years later, <i>Flast</i> was resuscitated in <i>Bowen v. Kendrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112138\"><a href=\"/opinion/112138/bowen-v-kendrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span>, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988). The taxpayers there brought facial and as-applied Establishment Clause challenges to the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA), which was a congressional scheme that provided grants to public or nonprofit private organizations to combat premarital adolescent pregnancy and sex. <i>Id.,</i> at 593, 108 S.Ct. 2562. The as-applied challenge focused on whether particular grantees selected by the Secretary of Health and Human Services were constitutionally permissible recipients. <i>Id.,</i> at 620-622, 108 S.Ct. 2562. The Solicitor General argued that, under <i>Valley Forge's</i> application of <i>Flast's</i> first prong, the taxpayers lacked standing for their as-applied claim because that claim was really a challenge to executive decisionmaking, not to Congress's exercise of its taxing and spending power. 487 U.S., at 618-619, 108 S.Ct. 2562. The Court rejected this contention, holding that the taxpayers' as-applied claim was still a challenge to Congress's taxing and spending power even <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2579</span> though disbursement of the funds authorized by Congress had been administered by the Secretary. <i>Id.,</i> at 619, 108 S.Ct. 2562.</p>\n<p><i>Kendrick,</i> like <i>Flast</i> before it, was obviously based on Psychic Injury: The taxpayers could not possibly make, and did not attempt to make, the showing required for Wallet Injury. But by relying on Psychic Injury, <i>Kendrick</i> perfectly revealed the incompatibility of that concept with the outcome in <i>Doremus.</i> Just as <i>Kendrick</i> did not care whether the appropriated funds would have been spent anyway \u0097 given to a different, permissible recipient \u0097 so also <i>Doremus</i> should not have cared that the teachers would likely receive the same salary once their classroom activities were limited to secular conduct. <i>Flast</i> and <i>Kendrick's</i> acceptance of Psychic Injury is fundamentally at odds with <i>Frothingham, Doremus,</i> and <i>Valley Forge.</i></p>\n<p>Which brings me to the final case worthy of mention. Last Term, in <i>DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno,</i> 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1854, 164 L.Ed.2d 589 (2006), we concisely confirmed that <i>Flast</i> was based on Psychic Injury. The taxpayers in that case sought to rely on <i>Flast</i> to raise a Commerce Clause challenge to a state franchise tax credit. 547 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1864. In rejecting the analogy and denying standing, we described <i>Flast</i> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Court ... understood the `injury' alleged in Establishment Clause challenges to federal spending to be the very `extract[ion] and spen[ding]' of `tax money' in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff. And an injunction against the spending would of course redress <i>that</i> injury, regardless of whether lawmakers would dispose of the savings in a way that would benefit the taxpayer-plaintiffs personally.\" 547 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1865 (citation omitted; some alterations in original).</blockquote>\n<p>What <i>Cuno</i>'s conceptualization of <i>Flast</i> reveals is that there are only two logical routes available to this Court. We must initially decide whether Psychic Injury is consistent with Article III. If it is, we should apply <i>Flast</i> to <i>all</i> challenges to government expenditures in violation of constitutional provisions that specifically limit the taxing and spending power; if it is not, we should overturn <i>Flast.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The plurality today avails itself of neither principled option. Instead, essentially accepting the Solicitor General's primary submission, it limits <i>Flast</i> to challenges to expenditures that are \"expressly authorized or mandated by ... specific congressional enactment.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2568. It offers no intellectual justification for this limitation, except that \"[i]t is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2571. That is true enough, but since courts purport to be engaged in <i>reasoned</i> decisionmaking, it is <i>only</i> true when (1) the precedent's logic is seen to require narrowing or readjustment in light of relevant distinctions that the new fact situation brings to the fore; or (2) its logic is fundamentally flawed, and so deserves to be limited to the facts that begot it. Today's plurality claims neither of these justifications. As to the first, the plurality offers no explanation of why the factual differences between this case and <i>Flast</i> are <i>material.</i> It virtually admits that express congressional allocation <i>vel non</i> has nothing to do with whether the plaintiffs have alleged an injury in fact that is fairly traceable and likely to be redressed. See <i>ante,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2580</span> 2568-2569. As the dissent correctly contends and I shall not belabor, see <i>post,</i> at 2585-2586 (opinion of SOUTER, J.), <i>Flast</i> is <i>indistinguishable</i> from this case for purposes of Article III. Whether the challenged government expenditure is expressly allocated by a specific congressional enactment <i>has absolutely no relevance</i> to the Article III criteria of injury in fact, traceability, and redressability.</p>\n<p>Yet the plurality is also unwilling to acknowledge that the logic of <i>Flast</i> (its Psychic Injury rationale) is simply wrong, and <i>for that reason</i> should not be extended to other cases. Despite the lack of acknowledgment, however, that is the only plausible explanation for the plurality's indifference to whether the \"distinguishing\" fact is legally material, and for its determination to limit <i>Flast</i> to its \"`<i>resul[t],'\" ante,</i> at 2568-2569.<sup>[3]</sup> Why, then, pick a distinguishing fact that may breathe life into <i>Flast</i> in future cases, preserving the disreputable disarray of our Establishment Clause standing jurisprudence? Why not hold that only taxpayers raising Establishment Clause challenges to expenditures pursuant to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 have standing? That, I suppose, would be too obvious a repudiation of <i>Flast,</i> and thus an impediment to the plurality's pose of minimalism.</p>\n<p>Because the express-allocation line has no mooring to our tripartite test for Article III standing, it invites demonstrably absurd results. For example, the plurality would deny standing to a taxpayer challenging the President's disbursement to a religious organization of a discrete appropriation that Congress had not explicitly allocated to that purpose, even if everyone knew that Congress and the President had informally negotiated that the entire sum would be spent in that precise manner. See <i>ante,</i> at 2568, n. 7 (holding that nonstatutory earmarks are insufficient to satisfy the express-allocation requirement). And taxpayers should lack standing to bring Establishment Clause challenges to the Executive Branch's use of appropriated funds when those expenditures have the <i>added vice</i> of violating congressional restrictions. If, for example, Congress instructs the President to disburse grants to hospitals that he deems worthy, and the President instead gives all of the money to the Catholic Church, \"[t]he link between congressional action and constitutional violation that supported taxpayer standing in <i>Flast</i> [would be] missing.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2565-2566. Indeed, taking the plurality at its word, Congress could insulate the President from <i>all Flast</i>-based suits by codifying the truism that no appropriation can be spent by the Executive Branch in a manner that violates the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p>Any last pretense of minimalism\u0097of adhering to prior law but merely declining to \"extend\" it\u0097is swept away by the fact that the Court's holding flatly contradicts <i>Kendrick.</i> The whole point of the as-applied challenge in <i>Kendrick</i> was that the Secretary, not Congress, had <i>chosen</i> inappropriate grant recipients. 487 U.S., at 620-622, 108 S.Ct. 2562. Both <i>Kendrick</i> and this case equally involve, in the relevant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2581</span> sense, attacks on executive discretion rather than congressional decision: Congress generally authorized the spending of tax funds for certain purposes but did not explicitly mandate that they be spent in the <i>unconstitutional</i> manner challenged by the taxpayers. I thus share the dissent's bewilderment, see <i>post,</i> at 2586-2587 (opinion of SOUTER, J.), as to why the plurality fixates on the amount of <i>additional</i> discretion the Executive Branch enjoys under the law beyond the only discretion relevant to the Establishment Clause issue: whether to spend taxpayer funds for a purpose that is unconstitutional. See <i>ante,</i> at 2572 (focusing on whether the case involves \"a <i>purely</i> discretionary Executive Branch expenditure\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>While I have been critical of the Members of the plurality, I by no means wish to give the impression that respondents' legal position is any more coherent. Respondents argue that <i>Flast</i> did not turn on whether Congress has expressly allocated the funds to the allegedly unconstitutional use, and their case plainly rests on Psychic Injury. They repeatedly emphasize that the injury in <i>Flast</i> was merely the governmental extraction and spending of tax money in aid of religion. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondents 28. Respondents refuse to admit that their argument logically implies, for the reasons already discussed, that <i>every</i> expenditure of tax revenues that is alleged to violate the Establishment Clause is subject to suit under <i>Flast.</i></p>\n<p>Of course, such a concession would run headlong into the denial of standing in <i>Doremus.</i> Respondents' only answer to <i>Doremus</i> is the cryptic assertion that the injury there was not fairly traceable to the unconstitutional conduct. Brief for Respondents 21, and n. 7. This makes no sense. On <i>Flast's</i> theory of Psychic Injury, the injury in <i>Doremus</i> was perfectly traceable and not in any way attenuated. It consisted of the psychic frustration that tax funds were being used in violation of the Establishment Clause, which was directly caused by the paying of teachers to read the Bible, and which would have been remedied by prohibition of that expenditure.<sup>[4]</sup> The hollowness of respondents' traceability argument is perhaps best demonstrated by their counsel's game submission at oral argument that there would be standing to challenge the hiring of a single Secret Service agent who guarded the President during religious trips, but no standing if those responsibilities (and the corresponding taxpayer-funded compensation) were spread out over the entire Secret Service protective detail. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38-39.</p>\n<p>The logical consequence of respondents' position finds no support in this Court's precedents or our Nation's history. Any taxpayer would be able to sue whenever tax funds were used in alleged violation of the Establishment Clause. So, for example, any taxpayer could challenge the fact that the Marshal of our Court is paid, in part, to call the courtroom to order by proclaiming \"God Save the United States and this Honorable Court.\" As much as respondents wish to deny that this is what <i>Flast</i> logically entails, it blinks reality to conclude otherwise. If respondents are to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2582</span> prevail, they must endorse a future in which ideologically motivated taxpayers could \"roam the country in search of governmental wrongdoing and ... reveal their discoveries in federal court,\" transforming those courts into \"ombudsmen of the general welfare\" with respect to Establishment Clause issues. <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S., at 487, 102 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, the arguments by the parties in this case and the opinions of my colleagues serve only to confirm that <i>Flast's</i> adoption of Psychic Injury has to be addressed head-on. Minimalism is an admirable judicial trait, but not when it comes at the cost of meaningless and disingenuous distinctions that hold the sure promise of engendering further meaningless and disingenuous distinctions in the future. The rule of law is ill served by forcing lawyers and judges to make arguments that deaden the soul of the law, which is logic and reason. Either <i>Flast</i> was correct, and must be accorded the wide application that it logically dictates, or it was not, and must be abandoned in its entirety. I turn, finally, to that question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Is a taxpayer's purely psychological displeasure that his funds are being spent in an allegedly unlawful manner ever sufficiently concrete and particularized to support Article III standing? The answer is plainly no.</p>\n<p>As I noted at the outset, <i>Lujan</i> explained that the \"consisten[t]\" view of this Court has been that \"a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about government\u0097claiming only harm to his and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large\u0097does not state an Article III case or controversy.\" 504 U.S., at 573-574, 112 S.Ct. 2130. As evidence of the consistency with which we have affirmed that understanding, <i>Lujan</i> relied on the reasoning in <i>Frothingham,</i> and in several other cases, including <i>Ex parte Levitt,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></span>, 58 S.Ct. 1, 82 L.Ed. 493 (1937) (dismissing suit challenging Justice Black's appointment to this Court in alleged violation of the Ineligibility Clause, Art. I, \u00a7 6, cl. 2), <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109086\"><a href=\"/opinion/109086/united-states-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span>, 94 S.Ct. 2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974) (denying standing to challenge the Government's failure to disclose the CIA's expenditures in alleged violation of the Accounts Clause, Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7), and <i>Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109087\"><a href=\"/opinion/109087/schlesinger-v-reservists-comm-to-stop-the-war/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974) (rejecting challenge to Members of Congress holding commissions in the military Reserves in alleged violation of the Incompatibility Clause, Art. I, \u00a7 6, cl. 2). See 504 U.S., at 573-577, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Just this Term, relying on precisely the same cases and the same reasoning, we held unanimously that suits raising only generalized grievances do not satisfy Article III's requirement that the injury in fact be concrete and particularized. See <i>Lance,</i> 549 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1196-1197.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Nor does <i>Flast</i>'s limitation on Psychic Injury\u0097the limitation that it suffices only when the two-pronged \"nexus\" test is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2583</span> met\u0097cure the Article III deficiency. The fact that it is the alleged violation of a specific constitutional limit on the taxing and spending power that produces the tax-payer's mental angst does not change the fundamental flaw. It remains the case that the taxpayer seeks \"relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large.\" <i>Lujan, supra,</i> at 573-574, 112 S.Ct. 2130. And it is of no conceivable relevance to this issue whether the Establishment Clause was originally conceived of as a specific limitation on the taxing and spending power. Madison's Remonstrance has nothing whatever to say on the question whether suits alleging violations of that limitation are anything other than the generalized grievances that federal courts had always been barred from considering before <i>Flast. Flast</i> was forced to rely on the slim reed of the Remonstrance since there was no better support for its novel conclusion, in 1968, that violation of the Establishment Clause, unique among the provisions of our law, had always inflicted a personalized Psychic Injury upon all taxpayers that federal courts had the power to remedy.</p>\n<p>Moreover, <i>Flast</i> is damaged goods, not only because its fanciful two-pronged \"nexus\" test has been demonstrated to be irrelevant to the test's supposed objective, but also because its cavalier treatment of the standing requirement rested upon a fundamental underestimation of that requirement's importance. <i>Flast</i> was explicitly and erroneously premised on the idea that Article III standing does not perform a crucial separation-of-powers function:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The question whether a particular person is a proper party to maintain the action does not, by its own force, raise separation of powers problems related to improper judicial interference in areas committed to other branches of the Federal Government. Such problems arise, if at all, only from the substantive issues the individual seeks to have adjudicated. Thus, in terms of Article III limitations on federal court jurisdiction, the question of standing is related only to whether the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution.\" 392 U.S., at 100-101, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</blockquote>\n<p>A perceptive Frenchman, visiting the United States some 135 years before Chief Justice Warren wrote these words, perceived that they were false.</p>\n<blockquote>\"It is true that ... judicial censure, exercised by the courts on legislation, cannot extend without distinction to all laws, <i>for there are some of them that can never give rise to the sort of clearly formulated dispute that one calls a case.</i>\" A. de Tocqueville, Democracy in America 97 (H. Mansfield &amp; D. Winthrop transls. and eds.2000) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p><i>Flast's</i> crabbed (and judge-empowering) understanding of the role Article III standing plays in preserving our system of separated powers has been repudiated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"To permit a complainant who has no concrete injury to require a court to rule on important constitutional issues in the abstract would create the potential for abuse of the judicial process, distort the role of the Judiciary in its relationship to the Executive and the Legislature and open the Judiciary to an arguable charge of providing `government by injunction.'\" <i>Schlesinger, supra,</i> at 222, 94 S.Ct. 2925.</blockquote>\n<p>See also <i>Richardson,</i> 418 U.S., at 179-180, 94 S.Ct. 2940; <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S., at 474, 102 S.Ct. 752; <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S., at 576-577, 112 S.Ct. 2130. We twice have noted explicitly that <i>Flast</i> failed to recognize the vital separation-of-powers aspect <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2584</span> of Article III standing. See <i>Spencer v. Kemna,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118176\"><a href=\"/opinion/118176/spencer-v-kemna/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11-12, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <i>Lewis v. Casey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span>, 353, n. 3, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). And once a proper understanding of the relationship of standing to the separation of powers is brought to bear, Psychic Injury, even as limited in <i>Flast,</i> is revealed for what it is: a contradiction of the basic propositions that the function of the judicial power \"is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals,\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 170, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), and that generalized grievances affecting the public at large have their remedy in the political process.</p>\n<p>Overruling prior precedents, even precedents as disreputable as <i>Flast,</i> is nevertheless a serious undertaking, and I understand the impulse to take a minimalist approach. But laying just claim to be honoring <i>stare decisis</i> requires more than beating <i>Flast</i> to a pulp and then sending it out to the lower courts weakened, denigrated, more incomprehensible than ever, and yet somehow technically alive. Even before the addition of the new meaningless distinction devised by today's plurality, taxpayer standing in Establishment Clause cases has been a game of chance. In the proceedings below, well-respected federal judges declined to hear this case en banc, not because they thought the issue unimportant or the panel decision correct, but simply because they found our cases so lawless that there was no point in, quite literally, second-guessing the panel. See <i>Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc. v. Chao,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794313\"><a href=\"/opinion/794313/freedom-from-religion-foundation-inc-v-elaine-l-ch/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span> (C.A.7 2006) (Flaum, C. J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc); <i>id.,</i> at 989-990 (Easterbrook, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (describing our cases as \"arbitrary,\" \"illogical,\" and lacking in \"comprehensiveness and rationality\"). We had an opportunity today to erase this blot on our jurisprudence, but instead have simply smudged it.</p>\n<p>My call for the imposition of logic and order upon this chaotic set of precedents will perhaps be met with the snappy epigram that \"[t]he life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.\" O. Holmes, The Common Law 1 (1881). But what experience has shown is that <i>Flast's</i> lack of a logical theoretical underpinning has rendered our taxpayer-standing doctrine such a jurisprudential disaster that our appellate judges do not know what to make of it. And of course the case has engendered no reliance interests, not only because one does not arrange his affairs with an eye to standing, but also because there is no relying on the random and irrational. I can think of few cases less warranting of <i>stare decisis</i> respect. It is time\u0097it is past time\u0097to call an end. <i>Flast</i> should be overruled.</p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice GINSBURG, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p><i>Flast v. Cohen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107731\"><a href=\"/opinion/107731/flast-v-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), held that plaintiffs with an Establishment Clause claim could \"demonstrate the necessary stake as taxpayers in the outcome of the litigation to satisfy Article III requirements.\" Here, the controlling, plurality opinion declares that <i>Flast</i> does not apply, but a search of that opinion for a suggestion that these taxpayers have any less stake in the outcome than the taxpayers in <i>Flast</i> will come up empty: the plurality makes no such finding, nor could it. Instead, the controlling opinion closes the door on these taxpayers because the Executive Branch, and not the Legislative Branch, caused their injury. I see no basis for this distinction in either logic or precedent, and respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>We held in <i>Flast,</i> and repeated just last Term, that the \"`injury' alleged in Establishment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2585</span> Clause challenges to federal spending\" is \"the very `extract[ion] and spen[ding]' of `tax money' in aid of religion.\" <i>DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno,</i> 547 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 1854, 1865, 164 L.Ed.2d 589 (2006) (quoting <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 106, 88 S.Ct. 1942; alterations in original). As the Court said in <i>Flast,</i> the importance of that type of injury has deep historical roots going back to the ideal of religious liberty in James Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, that the government in a free society may not \"force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment\" of religion. 2 Writings of James Madison 183, 186 (G. Hunt ed.1901) (hereinafter Madison), quoted in <i>Flast, supra,</i> at 103, 88 S.Ct. 1942. Madison thus translated into practical terms the right of conscience described when he wrote that \"[t]he Religion... of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate.\" Madison 184; see also <i>Zelman v. Simmons-Harris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121168\"><a href=\"/opinion/121168/zelman-v-simmons-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span>, 711, n. 22, 122 S.Ct. 2460, 153 L.Ed.2d 604 (2002) (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (\"As a historical matter, the protection of liberty of conscience may well have been the central objective served by the Establishment Clause\"); <i>Locke v. Davey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131166\"><a href=\"/opinion/131166/locke-v-davey/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></a></span>, 722, 124 S.Ct. 1307, 158 L.Ed.2d 1 (2004) (\"Since the founding of our country, there have been popular uprisings against procuring taxpayer funds to support church leaders, which was one of the hallmarks of an `established' religion\"); N. Feldman, Divided By God: America's Church-State Problem\u0097And What We Should Do About It 48 (2005) (\"The advocates of a constitutional ban on establishment were concerned about paying taxes to support religious purposes that their consciences told them not to support\").</p>\n<p>The right of conscience and the expenditure of an identifiable three pence raised by taxes for the support of a religious cause are therefore not to be split off from one another. The three pence implicates the conscience, and the injury from Government expenditures on religion is not accurately classified with the \"Psychic Injury\" that results whenever a congressional appropriation or executive expenditure raises hackles of disagreement with the policy supported, see <i>ante,</i> at 2577 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Justice Stewart recognized this in his concurring opinion in <i>Flast,</i> when he said that \"every taxpayer can claim a personal constitutional right not to be taxed for the support of a religious institution,\" and thus distinguished the case from one in which a taxpayer sought only to air a generalized grievance in federal court. 392 U.S., at 114, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p>Here, there is no dispute that taxpayer money in identifiable amounts is funding conferences, and these are alleged to have the purpose of promoting religion. Cf. <i>Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104971\"><a href=\"/opinion/104971/doremus-v-board-of-ed-of-hawthorne/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span>, 434, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952). The taxpayers therefore seek not to \"extend\" <i>Flast, ante,</i> at 2571-2572 (plurality opinion), but merely to apply it. When executive agencies spend identifiable sums of tax money for religious purposes, no less than when Congress authorizes the same thing, taxpayers suffer injury. And once we recognize the injury as sufficient for Article III, there can be no serious question about the other elements of the standing enquiry: the injury is indisputably \"traceable\" to the spending, and \"likely to be redressed by\" an injunction prohibiting it. <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111258\"><a href=\"/opinion/111258/allen-v-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span>, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984); see also <i>Cuno, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1865 (\"[A]n injunction against the spending would of course redress <i>that</i> injury\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2586</span> The plurality points to the separation of powers to explain its distinction between legislative and executive spending decisions, see <i>ante,</i> at 2569-2570, but there is no difference on that point of view between a Judicial Branch review of an executive decision and a judicial evaluation of a congressional one. We owe respect to each of the other branches, no more to the former than to the latter, and no one has suggested that the Establishment Clause lacks applicability to executive uses of money. It would surely violate the Establishment Clause for the Department of Health and Human Services to draw on a general appropriation to build a chapel for weekly church services (no less than if a statute required it), and for good reason: if the Executive could accomplish through the exercise of discretion exactly what Congress cannot do through legislation, Establishment Clause protection would melt away.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>So in <i>Bowen v. Kendrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112138\"><a href=\"/opinion/112138/bowen-v-kendrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span>, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988), we recognized the equivalence between a challenge to a congressional spending bill and a claim that the Executive Branch was spending an appropriation, each in violation of the Establishment Clause. We held that the \"claim that ... funds [were] being used improperly by individual grantees [was no] less a challenge to congressional taxing and spending power simply because the funding authorized by Congress has flowed through and been administered by the Secretary,\" and we added that \"we have not questioned the standing of taxpayer plaintiffs to raise Establishment Clause challenges, even when their claims raised questions about the administratively made grants.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 619, 108 S.Ct. 2562.</p>\n<p>The plurality points out that the statute in <i>Bowen</i> \"expressly authorized and appropriated specific funds for grantmaking\" and \"expressly contemplated that some of those moneys might go to projects involving religious groups.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2567. That is all true, but there is no reason to think it should matter, and every indication in <i>Bowen</i> that it did not. In <i>Bowen</i> we already had found the statute valid on its face before we turned to the taxpayers' as-applied challenge, see 487 U.S., at 618, 108 S.Ct. 2562, so the case cannot be read to hold that taxpayers have standing only to claim that congressional action, but not its implementation, violates the Establishment Clause. Thus, after <i>Bowen,</i> the plurality's distinction between a \"congressional mandate\" on the one hand and \"executive discretion\" on the other, <i>ante,</i> at 2568, is at once arbitrary and hard to manage: if the statute itself is constitutional, all complaints must be about the exercise of \"executive discretion,\" so there is no line to be drawn between <i>Bowen</i> and the case before us today.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2587</span> II</h2>\n<p>While <i>Flast</i> standing to assert the right of conscience is in a class by itself, it would be a mistake to think that case is unique in recognizing standing in a plaintiff without injury to flesh or purse. Cognizable harm takes account of the nature of the interest protected, which is the reason that \"the constitutional component of standing doctrine incorporates concepts concededly not susceptible of precise definition,\" leaving it impossible \"to make application of the constitutional standing requirement a mechanical exercise.\" <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S., at 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315. The question, ultimately, has to be whether the injury alleged is \"too abstract, or otherwise not appropriate, to be considered judicially cognizable.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 752, 104 S.Ct. 3315.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In the case of economic or physical harms, of course, the \"injury in fact\" question is straightforward. But once one strays from these obvious cases, the enquiry can turn subtle. Are esthetic harms sufficient for Article III standing? What about being forced to compete on an uneven playing field based on race (without showing that an economic loss resulted), or living in a racially gerrymandered electoral district? These injuries are no more concrete than seeing one's tax dollars spent on religion, but we have recognized each one as enough for standing. See <i>Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-inc-v-laidlaw-environmental-servi/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 183, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (esthetic injury); <i>Northeastern Fla.

The judgment of sufficient injury takes account of the Madisonian relationship of tax money and conscience, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2588</span> but it equally reflects the Founders' pragmatic \"conviction that individual religious liberty could be achieved best under a government which was stripped of all power to tax, to support, or otherwise to assist any or all religions,\" <i>Everson v.

In 1965-1966, for example, 91.1 percent of all nonpublic elementary schools and 78.2 percent of all nonpublic secondary schools in the United States were religiously affiliated. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, Statistics of Nonpublic Elementary and Secondary Schools 1965-66, p. 7 (1968). Congress surely understood that much of the aid mandated by the statute would find its way to religious schools.</p>\n<p>[4]  See, <i>e.g.,</i> 119 Stat. 2472 (appropriating $53,830,000 \"to be available for allocation within the Executive Office of the President\").</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>Valley Forge</i> also relied on a second rationale: that the authorizing Act was an exercise of Congress' power under the Property Clause of Art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2, and not the Taxing and Spending Clause of Art. I, \u00a7 8. 454 U.S., at 480, 102 S.Ct. 752. But this conclusion merely provided an additional\u0097\"and perhaps redundan[t],\" <i>ibid.</i>\u0097basis for denying a claim of standing that was already foreclosed because it was not based on any congressional action.</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, the statute noted that the problems of adolescent premarital sex and pregnancy \"are best approached through a variety of integrated and essential services provided to adolescents and their families\" by \"religious and charitable organizations,\" among other groups. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300z(a)(8)(B) (1982 ed.). It went on to mandate that federally provided services in that area should \"emphasize the provision of support by other family members, religious and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups.\" \u00a7 300z(a)(10)(c). And it directed that demonstration projects funded by the government \"shall ... make use of support systems\" such as religious organizations, \u00a7 300z-2(a), and required grant applicants to describe how they would \"involve religious and charitable organizations\" in their projects, \u00a7 300z-5(a)(21)(B).</p>\n<p>[7]  Nor is it relevant that Congress may have informally \"earmarked\" portions of its general Executive Branch appropriations to fund the offices and centers whose expenditures are at issue here. See, <i>e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 107-342, p. 108 (2001). \"[A] fundamental principle of appropriations law is that where `Congress merely appropriates lump-sum amounts without statutorily restricting what can be done with those funds, a clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions, and indicia in committee reports and other legislative history as to how the funds should or are expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirements on' the agency.\" <i>Lincoln,</i> 508 U.S., at 192, 113 S.Ct. 2024 (quoting <i>In re LTV Aerospace Corp.,</i> 55 Comp. Gen. 307, 319 (1975)); see also <i>TVA v. Hill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109897\"><a href=\"/opinion/109897/tva-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 191, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978) (\"Expressions of committees dealing with requests for appropriations cannot be equated with statutes enacted by Congress\").</p>\n<p>[1]  The text of the statute did not just authorize public-school teachers to read from the Bible, but <i>mandated</i> that they do so: \"At least five verses taken from that portion of the Holy Bible known as the Old Testament <i>shall be read,</i> or caused to be read, without comment, in each public school classroom, in the presence of the pupils therein assembled, <i>by the teacher in charge,</i> at the opening of school upon every school day... .\" N.J.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18:14-77 (1937) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[2]  There is a natural impulse to respond that the portion of the teachers' salary that corresponded to the time that they were required to read from the Bible was <i>de minimis.</i> But even <i>Flast</i> had the decency not to seize on a <i>de minimis</i> exception to distinguish <i>Doremus:</i> Having relied exclusively on Madison's Remonstrance to justify the conclusion that the Establishment Clause was a specific limitation on the taxing and spending power, see <i>Flast,</i> 392 U.S., at 103-104, 88 S.Ct. 1942, the Court could not simultaneously ignore Madison's admonition that \"`the same authority which can force a citizen <i>to contribute three pence only</i> of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 103, 88 S.Ct. 1942 (quoting Madison's Remonstrance; emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[3]  This explanation does not suffice with regard to Justice KENNEDY, who, unlike the other Members of the plurality, openly and avowedly contends both that <i>Flast</i> was correctly decided and that respondents should nevertheless lose this case. <i>Ante,</i> at 2572 (concurring opinion). He thus has the distinction of being the only Justice who affirms both propositions. I cannot begin to comprehend how the amorphous separation-of-powers concerns that motivate him, <i>ante,</i> at 2572-2573, bear upon whether the express-allocation requirement is grounded in the Article III criteria of injury in fact, traceability, or redressability.</p>\n<p>[4]  Nor is the dissent's oblique suggestion that <i>Doremus</i> did not involve an \"identifiable amoun[t]\" of taxpayer funds, <i>post,</i> at 2585 (opinion of SOUTER, J.), any more persuasive. One need not consult a CPA to realize that the portion of the school day during which the teachers' educational responsibilities were to read the Bible corresponded to a fraction of the teachers' taxpayer-funded salaries. And while the amount of money might well have been inconsequential, it was probably greater than three pence. See n. 2, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  It is true that this Court has occasionally in dicta described the prohibition on generalized grievances as merely a prudential bar. But the fountainhead of this dicta, <i>Warth v. Seldin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109301\"><a href=\"/opinion/109301/warth-v-seldin/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), supported its statement only by naked citation of <i>Schlesinger, Richardson,</i> and <i>Levitt.</i> 422 U.S., at 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197. But those cases squarely rested on Article III considerations, as the analysis in <i>Lujan</i> and <i>Lance</i> confirms.</p>\n<p>[1]  The plurality warns that a parade of horribles would result if there were standing to challenge executive action, because all federal activities are \"ultimately funded by some congressional appropriation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2569. But even if there is Article III standing in all of the cases posited by the plurality (and the Court of Appeals thought that at least sometimes there is not, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792876\"><a href=\"/opinion/792876/freedom-from-religion-foundation-inc-v-elaine-l-ch/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>, 996 (C.A.7 2006)), that does not mean taxpayers will prevail in such suits. If these claims are frivolous on the merits, I fail to see the harm in dismissing them for failure to state a claim instead of for lack of jurisdiction. To the degree the claims are meritorious, fear that there will be many of them does not provide a compelling reason, much less a reason grounded in Article III, to keep them from being heard.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Bowen</i> also indicated that the barrier to standing in <i>Valley Forge Christian College v.

In <i>Valley Forge,</i> we had first discussed the executive rather than legislative nature of the action at issue there and then, \"perhaps redundantly,\" 454 U.S., at 480, 102 S.Ct. 752, pointed to the distinction between the Property Clause and the Taxing and Spending Clause. Although at the time <i>Valley Forge</i> might have been taken to support the distinction the plurality draws today, <i>Bowen</i> said that <i>Valley Forge</i> rested on the distinction between the Property Clause on the one hand and the Taxing and Spending Clause on the other. See also <i>Valley Forge, supra,</i> at 480, n. 17, 102 S.Ct. 752 (noting that the transfer of property to a religious college involved no expenditure of funds).</p>\n<p>[3]  Although the plurality makes much of the fact that the injury in this case is \"generalized,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2563, and shared with the \"public-at-large,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2563, those properties on their own do not strip a would-be plaintiff of standing. See <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Akins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commn-v-akins/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 24, 118 S.Ct. 1777, 141 L.Ed.2d 10 (1998) (\"Often the fact that an interest is abstract and the fact that it is widely shared go hand in hand. But their association is not invariable, and where a harm is concrete, though widely shared, the Court has found `injury in fact'\").</p>\n<p>[4]  Outside the Establishment Clause context, as the plurality points out, we have not found the injury to a taxpayer when funds are improperly expended to suffice for standing. See <i>ante,</i> at 2568-2569 (citing examples).</p>\n<p>[5]  There will not always be competitors for the funds who would make better plaintiffs (and indeed there appears to be no such competitor here), so after accepting the importance of the injury there is no reason to refuse standing as a prudential matter.</p>\n\n</div>",
