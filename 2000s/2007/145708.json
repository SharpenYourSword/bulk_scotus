Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 261-263, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Several Circuits have held that, when doing so, they will presume that a sentence imposed within a properly calculated United States Sentencing Guidelines range is a reasonable sentence. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 177 Fed. Appx. 357, 358 (C.A.4 2006) <i>(per curiam)</i> (case below); see also United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov.2006) (USSG or Guidelines). The most important question before us is whether the law permits the courts of appeals to use this presumption. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The basic crime in this case concerns two false statements which Victor Rita, the petitioner, made under oath to a federal grand jury. The jury was investigating a gun company called InterOrdnance. Prosecutors believed that buyers of an InterOrdnance kit, called a \"PPSH 41 machinegun `parts kit,'\" could assemble a machinegun from the kit, that those kits consequently amounted to machineguns, and that InterOrdnance had not secured proper registrations for the importation of the guns. App. 7, 16-19, 21-22.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2460</span> Rita had bought a PPSH 41 machinegun parts kit. Rita, when contacted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), agreed to let a federal agent inspect the kit. <i>Id.,</i> at 119-120; Supp.App. 5-8. But before meeting with the agent, Rita called InterOrdnance and then sent back the kit. He subsequently turned over to ATF a different kit that apparently did not amount to a machinegun. App. 23-24, 120; Supp.App. 2-5, 8-10, 13-14.</p>\n<p>The investigating prosecutor brought Rita before the grand jury, placed him under oath, and asked him about these matters. Rita denied that the Government agent had asked him for the PPSH kit, and also denied that he had spoken soon thereafter about the PPSH kit to someone at InterOrdnance. App. 19, 120-121; Supp.App. 11-12. The Government claimed these statements were false, charged Rita with perjury, making false statements, and obstructing justice, and, after a jury trial, obtained convictions on all counts. App. 7-13, 94, 103.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The parties subsequently proceeded to sentencing. Initially, a probation officer, with the help of the parties, and after investigating the background both of the offenses and of the offender, prepared a presentence report. See Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 32(c)-(d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3552(a). The completed report describes \"offense characteristics,\" \"offender characteristics,\" and other matters that might be relevant to the sentence, and then calculates a Guidelines sentence. The report also sets forth factors potentially relevant to a departure from the Guidelines or relevant to the imposition of an other-than-Guidelines sentence. It ultimately makes a sentencing recommendation based on the Guidelines. App. 115-136.</p>\n<p>In respect to \"offense characteristics,\" for example, the report points out that the five counts of conviction all stem from a single incident. <i>Id.,</i> at 122. Hence, pursuant to the Guidelines, the report, in calculating a recommended sentence, groups the five counts of conviction together, treating them as if they amounted to the single most serious count among them (and ignoring all others). See USSG \u00a7 3D1.1. The single most serious offense in Rita's case is \"perjury.\" The relevant Guideline, \u00a7 2J1.3(c)(1), instructs the sentencing court (and the probation officer) to calculate the Guidelines sentence for \"perjury. . . in respect to a criminal offense\" by applying the Guideline for an \"accessory after the fact,\" as to that criminal offense. \u00a7 2X3.1. And that latter Guideline says that the judge, for calculation purposes, should take as a base offense level, a level that is \"6 levels lower than the offense level for the <i>underlying offense,</i>\" (emphasis added) (the offense that the perjury may have helped someone commit). Here the \"underlying offense\" consisted of InterOrdnance's possible violation of the machinegun registration law. App. 124; USSG \u00a7 2M5.2 (providing sentence for violation of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778(b)(2), importation of defense articles without authorization). The base offense level for the gun registration crime is 26. See USSG \u00a7 2M5.2. Six levels less is 20. And 20, says the presentence report, is the base offense level applicable to Rita for purposes of Guidelines sentence calculation. App. 45.</p>\n<p>The presentence report next considers Rita's \"Criminal History.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 125. Rita was convicted in May 1986, and sentenced to five years' probation for making false statements in connection with the purchase of firearms. Because this conviction took place more than 10 years before the present offense, it did not count <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2461</span> against Rita. And because Rita had no other relevant convictions, the Guidelines considered him as having no \"criminal history points.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The report consequently places Rita in criminal history category I, the lowest category for purposes of calculating a Guidelines' sentence.</p>\n<p>The report goes on to describe other \"Offender Characteristics.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 126. The description includes Rita's personal and family data, Rita's physical condition (including a detailed description of ailments), Rita's mental and emotional health, the lack of any history of substance abuse, Rita's vocational and nonvocational education, and Rita's employment record. It states that he served in the Armed Forces for over 25 years, on active duty and in the Reserve. During that time he received 35 commendations, awards, or medals of different kinds. The report analyzes Rita's financial condition. <i>Id.,</i> at 126-132.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the report calculates the Guidelines sentencing range. <i>Id.,</i> at 132. The Guidelines specify for base level 20, criminal history category I, a sentence of 33-to-41 months' imprisonment. <i>Ibid.</i> The report adds that there \"appears to be no circumstance or combination of circumstances that warrant a departure from the prescribed sentencing guidelines.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 133.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, both Rita and the Government presented their sentencing arguments. Each side addressed the report. Rita argued for a sentence outside (and lower than) the recommended Guidelines 33-to-41 month range.</p>\n<p>The judge made clear that Rita's argument for a lower sentence could take either of two forms. First, Rita might argue <i>within the Guidelines' framework,</i> for a departure from the applicable Guidelines range on the ground that his circumstances present an \"atypical case\" that falls outside the \"heartland\" to which the United States Sentencing Commission intends each individual Guideline to apply. USSG \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(2). Second, Rita might argue that, independent of the Guidelines, application of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) warrants a lower sentence. See <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 259-260, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>Thus, the judge asked Rita's counsel, \"Are you going to put on evidence to show that [Rita] should be getting a downward departure, or under 3553, your client would be entitled to a different sentence than he should get under sentencing guidelines?\" App. 52. And the judge later summarized:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Y]ou're asking for a departure from the guidelines or a sentence under 3553 that is lower than the guidelines, and here are the reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"One, he is a vulnerable defendant because he's been involved in [government criminal justice] work which has caused people to become convicted criminals who are in prison and there may be retribution against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Two, his military experience. . . .\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.,</i> at 64-65.</p>\n<p>Counsel agreed, while adding that Rita's poor physical condition constituted a third reason. And counsel said that he rested his claim for a lower sentence on \"[j]ust [those] three\" special circumstances, \"[p]hysical condition, vulnerability in prison and the military service.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 65. Rita presented evidence and argument related to these three factors. The Government, while not asking for a sentence higher than the report's recommended Guidelines range, said that Rita's perjury had interfered with the Government's potential <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2462</span> \"obstruction of justice\" claim against InterOrdnance and that Rita, as a former Government criminal justice employee, should have known better than to commit perjury. <i>Id.,</i> at 74-77. The sentencing judge asked questions about each factor.</p>\n<p>After hearing the arguments, the judge concluded that he was \"unable to find that the [report's recommended] sentencing guideline range . . . is an inappropriate guideline range for that, and under 3553. . . the public needs to be protected if it is true, and I must accept as true the jury verdict.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 87. The court concluded: \"So the Court finds that it is appropriate to enter\" a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range, namely a sentence of imprisonment \"for a period of 33 months.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Rita argued that his 33-month sentence was \"unreasonable\" because (1) it did not adequately take account of \"the defendant's history and characteristics,\" and (2) it \"is greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).\" Brief for Appellant in No. 05-4674 (CA4), pp. i, 8. The Fourth Circuit observed that it must set aside a sentence that is not \"reasonable.\" The Circuit stated that \"a sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range . . . is presumptively reasonable.\" It added that \"while we believe that the appropriate circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the guideline range will depend on the facts of individual cases, we have no reason to doubt that most sentences will continue to fall within the applicable guideline range.\" The Fourth Circuit then rejected Rita's arguments and upheld the sentence. <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E</h2>\n<p>Rita petitioned for a writ of certiorari. He pointed out that the Circuits are split as to the use of a presumption of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentences. Compare <i>United States v. Dorcely,</i> 454 F.3d 366, 376 (C.A.D.C.2006) (uses presumption); <i>United States v. Green,</i> 436 F.3d 449, 457 (C.A.4 2006) (same); <i>United States v. Alonzo,</i> 435 F.3d 551, 554 (C.A.5 2006) (same); <i>United States v. Williams,</i> 436 F.3d 706, 708 (C.A.6 2006) (same); <i>United States v. Mykytiuk,</i> 415 F.3d 606, 608 (C.A.7 2005) (same); <i>United States v. Lincoln,</i> 413 F.3d 716, 717 (C.A.8 2005) (same); and <i>United States v. Kristl,</i> 437 F.3d 1050, 1053-1054 (C.A.10 2006) <i>(per curiam)</i> (same), with <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 518 (C.A.1 2006) (en banc) (does not use presumption), <i>United States v. Fernandez,</i> 443 F.3d 19, 27 (C.A.2 2006) (same); <i>United States v. Cooper,</i> 437 F.3d 324, 331 (C.A.3 2006) (same); and <i>United States v. Talley,</i> 431 F.3d 784, 788 (C.A.11 2005) <i>(per curiam)</i> (same).</p>\n<p>We consequently granted Rita's petition. We agreed to decide whether a circuit court may afford a \"presumption of reasonableness\" to a \"within-Guidelines\" sentence. We also agreed to decide whether the District Court properly analyzed the relevant sentencing factors and whether, given the record, the District Court's ultimate choice of a 33-month sentence was \"unreasonable.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The first question is whether a court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines. We conclude that it can.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2463</span> A</h2>\n<p>For one thing, the presumption is not binding. It does not, like a trial-related evidentiary presumption, insist that one side, or the other, shoulder a particular burden of persuasion or proof lest they lose their case. C.f., <i>e.g., </i><i>Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez,</i> 540 U.S. 44, 49-50, n. 3, 124 S.Ct. 513, 157 L.Ed.2d 357 (2003) (citing <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), and <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). Nor does the presumption reflect strong judicial deference of the kind that leads appeals courts to grant greater factfinding leeway to an expert agency than to a district judge. Rather, the presumption reflects the fact that, by the time an appeals court is considering a within-Guidelines sentence on review, <i>both</i> the sentencing judge and the Sentencing Commission will have reached the <i>same</i> conclusion as to the proper sentence in the particular case. That double determination significantly increases the likelihood that the sentence is a reasonable one.</p>\n<p>Further, the presumption reflects the nature of the Guidelines-writing task that Congress set for the Commission and the manner in which the Commission carried out that task. In instructing both the <i>sentencing judge</i> and the <i>Commission</i> what to do, Congress referred to the basic sentencing objectives that the statute sets forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). That provision tells the <i>sentencing judge</i> to consider (1) offense and offender characteristics; (2) the need for a sentence to reflect the basic aims of sentencing, namely (a) \"just punishment\" (retribution), (b) deterrence, (c) incapacitation, (d) rehabilitation; (3) the sentences legally available; (4) the Sentencing Guidelines; (5) Sentencing Commission policy statements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted disparities; and (7) the need for restitution. The provision also tells the sentencing judge to \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with\" the basic aims of sentencing as set out above.</p>\n<p>Congressional statutes then tell the <i>Commission</i> to write Guidelines that will carry out these same \u00a7 3553(a) objectives. Thus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991(b) indicates that one of the Commission's basic objectives is to \"assure the meeting of the purposes of sentencing as set forth in [\u00a7 3553(a)(2)].\" The provision adds that the Commission must seek to \"provide certainty and fairness\" in sentencing, to \"avoi[d] unwarranted sentencing disparities,\" to \"maintai[n] sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors not taken into account in the establishment of general sentencing practices,\" and to \"reflect, to the extent practicable [sentencing-relevant] advancement in [the] knowledge of human behavior.\" Later provisions specifically instruct the Commission to write the Guidelines with reference to this statement of purposes, the statement that itself refers to \u00a7 3553(a). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 994(f), and 994(m).</p>\n<p>The upshot is that the sentencing statutes envision both the sentencing judge and the Commission as carrying out the same basic \u00a7 3553(a) objectives, the one, at retail, the other at wholesale.</p>\n<p>The Commission has made a serious, sometimes controversial, effort to carry out this mandate. The Commission, in describing its Guidelines-writing efforts, refers to these same statutory provisions. It says that it has tried to embody in the Guidelines the factors and considerations set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). The Commission's introductory statement recognizes that Congress \"foresees guidelines that will <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2464</span> further the basic purposes of criminal punishment, <i>i.e.,</i> deterring crime, incapacitating the offender, providing just punishment, and rehabilitating the offender.\" USSG \u00a7 1A.1, intro to comment., pt. A, \u00b6 2 (The Statutory Mission). It adds that Congress \"sought <i>uniformity</i> in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed by different federal courts for similar criminal conduct,\" as well as \"<i>proportionality</i> in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of different severity.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (The Basic Approach).</p>\n<p>The Guidelines commentary explains how, despite considerable disagreement within the criminal justice community, the Commission has gone about writing Guidelines that it intends to embody these ends. It says, for example, that the goals of <i>uniformity</i> and <i>proportionality</i> often conflict. The commentary describes the difficulties involved in developing a practical sentencing system that sensibly reconciles the two ends. It adds that a \"philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile the differing perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment.\" Some would emphasize moral culpability and \"just punishment\"; others would emphasize the need for \"crime control.\" Rather than choose among differing practical and philosophical objectives, the Commission took an \"empirical approach,\" beginning with an empirical examination of 10,000 presentence reports setting forth what judges had done in the past and then modifying and adjusting past practice in the interests of greater rationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with congressional instructions, and the like. <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 3, at 3.</p>\n<p>The Guidelines as written reflect the fact that the Sentencing Commission examined tens of thousands of sentences and worked with the help of many others in the law enforcement community over a long period of time in an effort to fulfill this statutory mandate. They also reflect the fact that different judges (and others) can differ as to how best to reconcile the disparate ends of punishment.</p>\n<p>The Commission's work is ongoing. The statutes and the Guidelines themselves foresee continuous evolution helped by the sentencing courts and courts of appeals in that process. The sentencing courts, applying the Guidelines in individual cases may depart (either pursuant to the Guidelines or, since <i>Booker,</i> by imposing a non-Guidelines sentence). The judges will set forth their reasons. The Courts of Appeals will determine the reasonableness of the resulting sentence. The Commission will collect and examine the results. In doing so, it may obtain advice from prosecutors, defenders, law enforcement groups, civil liberties associations, experts in penology, and others. And it can revise the Guidelines accordingly. See generally 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(p) and note following \u00a7 994 (Commission should review and amend Guidelines as necessary, and Congress has power to revoke or amend Guidelines); <i>Mistretta v. United States,</i> 488 U.S. 361, 393-394, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989); USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (listing 24 amendments promulgated in response to evolving sentencing concerns); USSG \u00a7 1A1.1, comment.</p>\n<p>The result is a set of Guidelines that seek to embody the \u00a7 3553(a) considerations, both in principle and in practice. Given the difficulties of doing so, the abstract and potentially conflicting nature of \u00a7 3553(a)'s general sentencing objectives, and the differences of philosophical view among those who work within the criminal justice community as to how best to apply general sentencing objectives, it is fair to assume that the Guidelines, insofar as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2465</span> practicable, reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve \u00a7 3553(a)'s objectives.</p>\n<p>An individual judge who imposes a sentence within the range recommended by the Guidelines thus makes a decision that is fully consistent with the Commission's judgment in general. Despite Justice SOUTER's fears to the contrary, <i>post,</i> at 2487-2488 (dissenting opinion), the courts of appeals' \"reasonableness\" presumption, rather than having independent legal effect, simply recognizes the real-world circumstance that when the judge's discretionary decision accords with the Commission's view of the appropriate application of \u00a7 3553(a) in the mine run of cases, it is probable that the sentence is reasonable. Indeed, even the Circuits that have declined to adopt a formal presumption also recognize that a Guidelines sentence will usually be reasonable, because it reflects both the Commission's and the sentencing court's judgment as to what is an appropriate sentence for a given offender. See <i>Fernandez,</i> 443 F.3d, at 27; <i>Cooper,</i> 437 F.3d, at 331; <i>Talley,</i> 431 F.3d, at 788.</p>\n<p>We repeat that the presumption before us is an <i>appellate</i> court presumption. Given our explanation in <i>Booker</i> that appellate \"reasonableness\" review merely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion, the presumption applies only on appellate review. The sentencing judge, as a matter of process, will normally begin by considering the presentence report and its interpretation of the Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3552(a); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32. He may hear arguments by prosecution or defense that the Guidelines sentence should not apply, perhaps because (as the Guidelines themselves foresee) the case at hand falls outside the \"heartland\" to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply, USSG \u00a7 5K2.0, perhaps because the Guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a) considerations, or perhaps because the case warrants a different sentence regardless. See Rule 32(f). Thus, the sentencing court subjects the defendant's sentence to the thorough adversarial testing contemplated by federal sentencing procedure. See Rules 32(f), (h), (i)(C) and (i)(D); see also <i>Burns v. United States,</i> 501 U.S. 129, 136, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991) (recognizing importance of notice and meaningful opportunity to be heard at sentencing). In determining the merits of these arguments, the sentencing court does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should apply. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 259-260, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Rita and his supporting <i>amici</i> make two further arguments against use of the presumption. First, Rita points out that many individual Guidelines apply higher sentences in the presence of special facts, for example, brandishing a weapon. In many cases, the sentencing judge, not the jury, will determine the existence of those facts. A pro-Guidelines \"presumption of reasonableness\" will increase the likelihood that courts of appeals will affirm such sentences, thereby increasing the likelihood that sentencing judges will impose such sentences. For that reason, Rita says, the presumption raises Sixth Amendment \"concerns.\" Brief for Petitioner 28.</p>\n<p>In our view, however, the presumption, even if it increases the likelihood that the judge, not the jury, will find \"sentencing facts,\" does not violate the Sixth Amendment. This Court's Sixth Amendment cases do not automatically forbid a sentencing court to take account of factual matters not determined by a jury and to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2466</span> increase the sentence in consequence. Nor do they prohibit the sentencing judge from taking account of the Sentencing Commission's factual findings or recommended sentences. See <i>Cunningham v. California,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 856, 863-864, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007), (citing <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 243-244, 125 S.Ct. 738; <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 304-305, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); <i>Ring v. Arizona,</i> 536 U.S. 584, 602, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002); and <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 471, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)).</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment question, the Court has said, is whether the law <i>forbids</i> a judge to increase a defendant's sentence <i>unless</i> the judge finds facts that the jury did not find (and the offender did not concede). <i>Blakely, supra,</i> at 303-304, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (\"When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury's verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts which the law makes essential to the punishment and the judge exceeds his proper authority\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); see <i>Cunningham, supra,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 865, 866 (discussing <i>Blakely</i>) (\"The judge could not have sentenced Blakely above the standard range without finding the additional fact of deliberate cruelty,\" \"[b]ecause the judge in Blakely's case could not have imposed a sentence outside the standard range without finding an additional fact, the top of that range . . . was the relevant\" maximum sentence for Sixth Amendment purposes); <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738 (\"Any fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt\"); <i>id.,</i> at 232, 125 S.Ct. 738 (discussing <i>Blakely</i>) (\"We rejected the State's argument that the jury verdict was sufficient to authorize a sentence within the general 10-year sentence for class B felonies, noting that under Washington law, the judge was <i>required</i> to find additional facts in order to impose the greater 90-month sentence\") (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>A nonbinding appellate presumption that a Guidelines sentence is reasonable does not <i>require</i> the sentencing judge to impose that sentence. Still less does it <i>forbid</i> the sentencing judge from imposing a sentence higher than the Guidelines provide for the jury-determined facts standing alone. As far as the law is concerned, the judge could disregard the Guidelines and apply the same sentence (higher than the statutory minimum or the bottom of the unenhanced Guidelines range) in the absence of the special facts (say, gun brandishing) which, in the view of the Sentencing Commission, would warrant a higher sentence within the statutorily permissible range. Thus, our Sixth Amendment cases do not forbid appellate court use of the presumption.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA concedes that the Sixth Amendment concerns he foresees are not presented by this case. <i>Post,</i> at 2478 (concurring in part and concurring in judgment). And his need to rely on <i>hypotheticals</i> to make his point is consistent with our view that the approach adopted here will not \"raise a multitude of constitutional problems.\" <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U.S. 371, 380-381, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005). Similarly, Justice SCALIA agrees that we have never held that \"the Sixth Amendment prohibits judges from ever finding any facts\" relevant to sentencing. <i>Post,</i> at 2477. In sentencing, as in other areas, district judges at times make mistakes that are substantive. At times, they will impose sentences that are unreasonable. Circuit courts exist to correct <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2467</span> such mistakes when they occur. Our decision in <i>Booker</i> recognized as much, 543 U.S., at 260-264, 125 S.Ct. 738. <i>Booker</i> held unconstitutional that portion of the Guidelines that made them mandatory. <i>Id.,</i> at 233-234, 243-244, 125 S.Ct. 738. It also recognized that when district courts impose discretionary sentences, which are reviewed under normal appellate principles by courts of appeals, such a sentencing scheme will ordinarily raise no Sixth Amendment concern. <i>Ibid</i>; see <i>id.,</i> at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738 (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.) (\"Indeed, everyone agrees that the constitutional issues presented by these cases would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the [federal sentencing statute] the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges\"). That being so, our opinion in <i>Booker</i> made clear that today's holding does not violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Rita may be correct that the presumption will encourage sentencing judges to impose Guidelines sentences. But we do not see how that fact could change the constitutional calculus. Congress sought to diminish unwarranted sentencing disparity. It sought a Guidelines system that would bring about greater fairness in sentencing through increased uniformity. The fact that the presumption might help achieve these congressional goals does not provide cause for holding the presumption unlawful as long as the presumption remains constitutional. And, given our case law, we cannot conclude that the presumption itself violates the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The fact that we permit courts of appeals to adopt a presumption of reasonableness does not mean that courts may adopt a presumption of unreasonableness. Even the Government concedes that appellate courts may not presume that every variance from the advisory Guidelines is unreasonable. See Brief for United States 34-35. Several courts of appeals have also rejected a presumption of unreasonableness. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Howard,</i> 454 F.3d 700, 703 (C.A.7 2006); <i>United States v. Matheny,</i> 450 F.3d 633, 642 (C.A.6 2006); <i>United States v. Myers,</i> 439 F.3d 415, 417 (C.A.8 2006); <i>United States v. Moreland,</i> 437 F.3d 424, 433 (C.A.4 2006). However, a number of circuits adhere to the proposition that the strength of the justification needed to sustain an outside-Guidelines sentence varies in proportion to the degree of the variance. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> 445 F.3d 1, 4 (C.A.1 2006); <i>United States v. Moreland,</i> 437 F.3d 424, 434 (C.A.4 2006); <i>United States v. Armendariz,</i> 451 F.3d 352, 358 (C.A.5 2006); <i>United States v. Davis,</i> 458 F.3d 491, 496 (C.A.6 2006); <i>United States v. Dean,</i> 414 F.3d 725, 729 (C.A.7 2005); <i>United States v. Dalton,</i> 404 F.3d 1029, 1033 (C.A.8 2005); <i>United States v. Bishop,</i> 469 F.3d 896, 907 (C.A.10 2006); <i>United States v. Crisp,</i> 454 F.3d 1285, 1291-1292 (C.A.11 2006). We will consider that approach next Term in <i>United States v. Gall,</i> No. 06-7949.</p>\n<p>Second, Rita and his <i>amici</i> claim that use of a pro-Guidelines presumption on appeal conflicts with Congress' insistence that sentencing judges apply the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (and that the resulting sentence be \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\" of sentencing set forth in that statute). We have explained above, however, why we believe that, where judge and Commission <i>both</i> determine that the Guidelines sentences is an appropriate sentence for the case at hand, that sentence likely reflects the \u00a7 3553(a) factors (including its \"not greater than necessary\" requirement). See <i>supra,</i> at 2463. This circumstance alleviates any serious general conflict between <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2468</span> \u00a7 3553(a) and the Guidelines, for the purposes of appellate review. And, for that reason, we find that nothing in \u00a7 3553(a) renders use of the presumption unlawful.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We next turn to the question whether the District Court properly analyzed the relevant sentencing factors. In particular, Rita argues that the court took inadequate account of \u00a7 3553(c) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), a provision that requires a sentencing judge, \"at the time of sentencing,\" to \"state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\" In our view, given the straightforward, conceptually simple arguments before the judge, the judge's statement of reasons here, though brief, was legally sufficient.</p>\n<p>The statute does call for the judge to \"state\" his \"reasons.\" And that requirement reflects sound judicial practice. Judicial decisions are reasoned decisions. Confidence in a judge's use of reason underlies the public's trust in the judicial institution. A public statement of those reasons helps provide the public with the assurance that creates that trust.</p>\n<p>That said, we cannot read the statute (or our precedent) as insisting upon a full opinion in every case. The appropriateness of brevity or length, conciseness or detail, when to write, what to say, depends upon circumstances. Sometimes a judicial opinion responds to every argument; sometimes it does not; sometimes a judge simply writes the word \"granted,\" or \"denied\" on the face of a motion while relying upon context and the parties' prior arguments to make the reasons clear. The law leaves much, in this respect, to the judge's own professional judgment.</p>\n<p>In the present context, a statement of reasons is important. The sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties' arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 487 U.S. 326, 336-337, 108 S.Ct. 2413, 101 L.Ed.2d 297 (1988). Nonetheless, when a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation. Circumstances may well make clear that the judge rests his decision upon the Commission's own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is a proper sentence (in terms of \u00a7 3353(a) and other congressional mandates) in the typical case, and that the judge has found that the case before him is typical. Unless a party contests the Guidelines sentence generally under \u00a7 3553(a)\u0097that is argues that the Guidelines reflect an unsound judgment, or, for example, that they do not generally treat certain defendant characteristics in the proper way\u0097or argues for departure, the judge normally need say no more. Cf. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). (Although, often at sentencing a judge will speak at length to a defendant, and this practice may indeed serve a salutary purpose.)</p>\n<p>Where the defendant or prosecutor presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence, however, the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments. Sometimes the circumstances will call for a brief explanation; sometimes they will call for a lengthier explanation. Where the judge imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines, the judge will explain why he has done so. To our knowledge, an ordinary explanation of judicial reasons as to why the judge has, or has not, applied the Guidelines triggers no Sixth Amendment \"jury trial\" requirement. Cf. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738 (\"For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2469</span> has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant\") and <i>id.,</i> at 242, 125 S.Ct. 738 (requirement of finding, not articulation of it, creates Sixth Amendment problem).</p>\n<p>By articulating reasons, even if brief, the sentencing judge not only assures reviewing courts (and the public) that the sentencing process is a reasoned process but also helps that process evolve. The sentencing judge has access to, and greater familiarity with, the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the Commission or the appeals court. That being so, his reasoned sentencing judgment, resting upon an effort to filter the Guidelines' general advice through \u00a7 3553(a)'s list of factors, can provide relevant information to both the court of appeals and ultimately the Sentencing Commission. The reasoned responses of these latter institutions to the sentencing judge's explanation should help the Guidelines constructively evolve over time, as both Congress and the Commission foresaw. See generally <i>supra,</i> at 2464-2465.</p>\n<p>In the present case the sentencing judge's statement of reasons was brief but legally sufficient. Rita argued for a downward departure from the 33-to-41 month Guidelines sentence on the basis of three sets of special circumstances: health, fear of retaliation in prison, and military record. See App. 40-47. He added that, in any event, these same circumstances warrant leniency beyond that contemplated by the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>The record makes clear that the sentencing judge listened to each argument. The judge considered the supporting evidence. The judge was fully aware of defendant's various physical ailments and imposed a sentence that takes them into account. The judge understood that Rita had previously worked in the immigration service where he had been involved in detecting criminal offenses. And he considered Rita's lengthy military service, including over 25 years of service, both on active duty and in the Reserve, and Rita's receipt of 35 medals, awards, and nominations.</p>\n<p>The judge then simply found these circumstances insufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the Guidelines range of 33 to 45 months. <i>Id.,</i> at 87. He said that this range was not \"inappropriate.\" (This, of course, is not the legal standard for imposition of sentence, but taken in context it is plain that the judge so understood.) He immediately added that he found that the 33-month sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range was \"appropriate.\" <i>Ibid.</i> He must have believed that there was not much more to say.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that the judge might have said more. He might have added explicitly that he had heard and considered the evidence and argument; that (as no one before him denied) he thought the Commission in the Guidelines had determined a sentence that was proper in the minerun of roughly similar perjury cases; and that he found that Rita's personal circumstances here were simply not different enough to warrant a different sentence. But context and the record make clear that this, or similar, reasoning, underlies the judge's conclusion. Where a matter is as conceptually simple as in the case at hand and the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments, we do not believe the law requires the judge to write more extensively.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>We turn to the final question: Was the Court of Appeals, after applying its presumption, legally correct in holding that Rita's sentence (a sentence that applied, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2470</span> and did not depart from, the relevant sentencing Guideline) was not \"unreasonable\"? In our view, the Court of Appeals' conclusion was lawful.</p>\n<p>As we previously said, see Part I, <i>supra,</i> the crimes at issue are perjury and obstruction of justice. In essence those offenses involved the making of knowingly false, material statements under oath before a grand jury, thereby impeding its criminal investigation. The Guidelines provide for a typical such offense a base offense level of 20, 6 levels below the level provided for a simple violation of the crime being investigated (here the unlawful importation of machineguns). The offender, Rita, has no countable prior offenses and consequently falls within criminal history category I. The intersection of base offense level 20 and criminal history category I sets forth a sentencing range of imprisonment of 33 to 45 months.</p>\n<p>Rita argued at sentencing that his circumstances are special. He based this argument upon his health, his fear of retaliation, and his prior military record. His sentence explicitly takes health into account by seeking assurance that the Bureau of Prisons will provide appropriate treatment. The record makes out no special fear of retaliation, asserting only that the threat is one that any former law enforcement official might suffer. Similarly, though Rita has a lengthy and distinguished military record, he did not claim at sentencing that military service should ordinarily lead to a sentence more lenient than the sentence the Guidelines impose. Like the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we simply cannot say that Rita's special circumstances are special enough that, in light of \u00a7 3553(a), they require a sentence lower than the sentence the Guidelines provide.</p>\n<p>Finally, Rita and supporting <i>amici</i> here claim that the Guidelines sentence is not reasonable under \u00a7 3553(a) because it expressly declines to consider various personal characteristics of the defendant, such as physical condition, employment record, and military service, under the view that these factors are \"not ordinarily relevant.\" USSG \u00a7\u00a7 5H1.4, 5H1.5, 5H1.11. Rita did not make this argument below, and we shall not consider it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins as to all but Part II, concurring.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that the Court's remedial opinion in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was not unanimous. See <i>id.,</i> at 272, 125 S.Ct. 738 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). But <i>Booker</i> is now settled law and must be accepted as such. See B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921) (\"[T]he labor of judges would be increased almost to the breaking point if every past decision could be reopened in every case, and one could not lay one's own course of bricks on the secure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gone before him\"). Therefore, our task today is to apply <i>Booker's</i> \"reasonableness\" standard to a District Judge's decision to impose a sentence within the range recommended by United States Sentencing Guidelines that are now advisory, rather than binding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Simply stated, <i>Booker</i> replaced the <i>de novo</i> standard of review required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) with an abuse-of-discretion standard that we called \"`reasonableness'\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2471</span> review. 543 U.S., at 262, 125 S.Ct. 738. We noted in <i>Booker</i> that the <i>de novo</i> standard was a recent addition to the law. Prior to 2003, appellate courts reviewed sentencing departures for abuse of discretion under our decision in <i>Koon v. United States,</i> 518 U.S. 81, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). In 2003, however, Congress overruled <i>Koon</i> and added the <i>de novo</i> standard to \u00a7 3742(e). See Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, \u00a7 401(d)(1), 117 Stat. 670. Recognizing that \"the reasons for th[is] revisio[n]\u0097 to make Guidelines sentencing even more mandatory than it had been\u0097 ... ceased to be relevant\" in light of the Court's constitutional holding,<sup>[1]</sup><i>Booker</i> excised the portion of \u00a7 3742(e) that directed courts of appeals to apply the <i>de novo</i> standard. 543 U.S., at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738. Critically, we did not touch the portions of \u00a7 3742(e) requiring appellate courts to \"give due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses,\" to \"accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous,\" and to \"give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\" By leaving those portions of the statute intact while severing the portion mandating a <i>de novo</i> standard of review, <i>Booker</i> restored the abuse-of-discretion standard identified in three earlier cases: <i>Pierce v. Underwood,</i> 487 U.S. 552, 558-560, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988), <i>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.,</i> 496 U.S. 384, 403-405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990), and <i>Koon.</i> See <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 260, 125 S.Ct. 738.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Pierce,</i> we considered whether the District Court had properly awarded attorney's fees based on a determination that the Government's litigation position was not \"substantially justified\" within the meaning of the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d). Because the Act did not specify a standard of review, we found it necessary to rely on several \"significant relevant factors\" that persuaded us to apply an \"`abuse of discretion'\" standard. 487 U.S., at 559, 108 S.Ct. 2541. One factor was that a district judge was \"`better positioned'\" than an appellate judge to decide the issue. <i>Id.,</i> at 560, 108 S.Ct. 2541 (quoting <i>Miller v. Fenton,</i> 474 U.S. 104, 114, 106 S.Ct. 445, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985)). We noted that a district court, through its participation in \"settlement conferences and other pretrial activities,\" \"may have insights not conveyed by the record, into such matters as whether particular evidence was worthy of being relied upon.\" 487 U.S., at 560, 108 S.Ct. 2541. We likewise noted that \"even where the district judge's full knowledge of the factual setting can be acquired by the appellate court, that acquisition will often come at unusual expense.\" <i>Ibid.</i> A second <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2472</span> factor that we found significant was the impracticability of formulating a rule of decision for an issue that may involve \"`multifarious, fleeting, special, narrow facts that utterly resist generalization.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 561-562, 108 S.Ct. 2541. In <i>Cooter &amp; Gell,</i> we held that both of these factors supported an \"abuse-of-discretion\" standard for review of a district judge's imposition of sanctions for violations of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See 496 U.S., at 403-405, 110 S.Ct. 2447. A third factor, the District Court's special knowledge about \"the local bar's litigation practices,\" also supported the abuse-of-discretion standard. <i>Id.,</i> at 404, 110 S.Ct. 2447. We further noted that \"[d]eference to the determination of courts on the front lines of litigation will enhance these courts' ability to control the litigants before them.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Recognizing that these factors bear equally upon a trial judge's sentencing decision, <i>Koon</i> expressly applied the principles of <i>Pierce</i> and <i>Cooter &amp; Gell</i> to the sentencing context. See <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S., at 99, 116 S.Ct. 2035. We adopted the same abuse-of-discretion standard, unanimously holding that a district court's decision to depart from the Guidelines \"will in most cases be due substantial deference, for it embodies the traditional exercise of discretion by a sentencing court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035. Echoing our earlier opinions, we added that \"[d]istrict courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts\" because they \"must make a refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome, informed by its vantage point and day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We also relied on the following statement in our opinion in <i>Williams v. United States,</i> 503 U.S. 193, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote>\"The development of the guideline sentencing regime has not changed our view that, except to the extent specifically directed by statute, `it is not the role of an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the sentencing court as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 205, 112 S.Ct. 1112 (quoting <i>Solem v. Helm,</i> 463 U.S. 277, 290, n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983)).</blockquote>\n<p>These basic considerations about the nature of sentencing have not changed in a post-<i>Booker</i> world. While the specific holding in <i>Koon</i> concerned only the scope of the trial judge's discretion on whether to depart from the Guidelines, now that the Guidelines are no longer mandatory, our reasoning applies with equal force to the sentencing judge's decision \"`as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence.'\" <i>Williams,</i> 503 U.S., at 205, 112 S.Ct. 1112. After <i>Booker,</i> appellate courts are now to assess a district court's exercise of discretion \"with regard to \u00a7 3553(a).\" 543 U.S., at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738. As we explained, \"Section 3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing. Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Guided by these \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <i>Booker's</i> abuse-of-discretion standard directs appellate courts to evaluate what motivated the District Judge's individualized sentencing decision. While reviewing courts may presume that a sentence within the advisory Guidelines is reasonable, appellate judges must still always defer to the sentencing judge's individualized sentencing determination. As we stated in <i>Koon,</i> \"[i]t has been uniform and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2473</span> and the punishment to ensue.\" 518 U.S., at 113, 116 S.Ct. 2035. The Commission has not developed any standards or recommendations that affect sentencing ranges for many individual characteristics. Matters such as age, education, mental or emotional condition, medical condition (including drug or alcohol addiction), employment history, lack of guidance as a youth, family ties, or military, civic, charitable, or public service are not ordinarily considered under the Guidelines. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a7 5H1.1-6, 11, and 12 (Nov.2006).<sup>[3]</sup> These are, however, matters that \u00a7 3553(a) authorizes the sentencing judge to consider. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). As such, they are factors that an appellate court must consider under <i>Booker's</i> abuse-of-discretion standard.</p>\n<p>My disagreement with Justice SCALIA and Justice SOUTER rests on the above understanding of <i>Booker's</i> standard of appellate review. I do not join Justice SCALIA's opinion because I believe that the purely procedural review he advocates is inconsistent with our remedial opinion in <i>Booker,</i> which plainly contemplated that reasonableness review would contain a substantive component. See 543 U.S., at 260-264, 125 S.Ct. 738. After all, a district judge who gives harsh sentences to Yankees fans and lenient sentences to Red Sox fans would not be acting reasonably even if her procedural rulings were impeccable. Moreover, even if some future unusually harsh sentence might violate the Sixth Amendment because it exceeds some yet-to-be-defined judicial standard of reasonableness, Justice SCALIA correctly acknowledges this case does not present such a problem. See <i>post,</i> at 2478 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"Nor is my claim that the Sixth Amendment was violated in this case, for petitioner cannot demonstrate that his relatively low sentence would have been unreasonable if the District Court had relied on nothing but jury-found or admitted facts\"); see also <i>ante,</i> at 2481-2482 (\"Justice SCALIA concedes that the Sixth Amendment concerns he foresees are not presented by this case. <i>Post,</i> at 2487-2488 (concurring in part and concurring in judgment). And his need to rely on <i>hypotheticals</i> to make his point is consistent with our view that the approach adopted here will not `raise a multitude of constitutional problems.' <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U.S. 371, 380-381, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005)\"). Such a hypothetical case should be decided if and when it arises. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</i> 454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982).</p>\n<p>As to Justice SOUTER's opinion, I think he overestimates the \"gravitational pull\" towards the advisory Guidelines that will result from a presumption of reasonableness. <i>Post,</i> at 2487-2488 (dissenting opinion). <i>Booker's</i> standard of review allows\u0097indeed, requires\u0097district judges to consider <i>all</i> of the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and to apply them to the individual defendants before them. Appellate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2474</span> courts must then give deference to the sentencing decisions made by those judges, whether the resulting sentence is inside or outside the advisory Guidelines range, under traditional abuse-of-discretion principles. As the Court acknowledges, moreover, <i>presumptively</i> reasonable does not mean <i>always</i> reasonable; the presumption, of course, must be genuinely rebuttable. See <i>ante,</i> at 2462-2463. I am not blind to the fact that, as a practical matter, many federal judges continued to treat the Guidelines as virtually mandatory after our decision in <i>Booker.</i> See <i>post,</i> at 2478, n. 3 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). One well-respected federal judge has even written that, \"after watching this Court\u0097and the other Courts of Appeals, whether they have formally adopted such a presumption or not\u0097affirm hundreds upon hundreds of within-Guidelines sentences, it seems to me that the rebuttability of the presumption is more theoretical than real.\" <i>United States v. Pruitt,</i> 487 F.3d 1298, 2007 WL 1589409, *11 (C.A.10 2007) (McConnell, J., concurring). Our decision today makes clear, however, that the rebuttability of the presumption is real. It should also be clear that appellate courts must review sentences individually and deferentially whether they are inside the Guidelines range (and thus potentially subject to a formal \"presumption\" of reasonableness) or outside that range. Given the clarity of our holding, I trust that those judges who had treated the Guidelines as virtually mandatory during the post-<i>Booker</i> interregnum will now recognize that the Guidelines are truly advisory.</p>\n<p>Applying this standard, I would affirm the sentence imposed by the District Court. Although I would have imposed a lower sentence had I been the District Judge, I agree that he did not abuse his discretion in making the particular decision that he did. I also agree with the Court that his decision is entitled to added respect because it was consistent with the advice in the Guidelines.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>That said, I do believe that there was a significant flaw in the sentencing procedure in this case. The petitioner is a veteran who received significant recognition for his service to his country. That aspect of his background is not taken into consideration in the sentencing guidelines and was not mentioned by the District Judge in his explanation of his choice of the sentence that defendant received. I regard this as a serious omission because I think the judge's statement to the defendant, made at the time of sentencing, is an especially important part of the criminal process. If the defendant is convinced that justice has been done in his case\u0097 that society has dealt with him fairly\u0097the likelihood of his successful rehabilitation will surely be enhanced. Nevertheless, given the importance of paying appropriate respect to the exercise of a sentencing judge's discretion, I join the Court's opinion and judgment.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>In <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), five Justices of this Court, I among them, held that our previous decision in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), applied to sentences imposed under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines because those Guidelines were mandatory and binding on judges. See 543 U.S., at 233-234, 243-244, 125 S.Ct. 738. We thus reaffirmed that \"[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2475</span> jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. In response to this constitutional holding, a different majority of five Justices held that the appropriate remedy was to make the Guidelines nonmandatory in all cases and to review sentences on appeal only for reasonableness. See <i>id.,</i> at 258-265, 125 S.Ct. 738. I disagreed with the Court's remedial choice, believing instead that the proper remedy was to maintain the mandatory character of the Guidelines and simply to require, for that small category of cases in which a fact was legally essential to the sentence imposed, that the fact be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the defendant. See <i>id.,</i> at 272-291, 125 S.Ct. 738 (STEVENS, J., joined by SCALIA and SOUTER, JJ., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>I do not mean to reopen that debate. As a matter of statutory <i>stare decisis,</i> I accept <i>Booker's</i> remedial holding that district courts are no longer bound by the Guidelines and that appellate courts should review the sentences imposed for reasonableness. As should be clear from our need to decide the case today, however, precisely what \"reasonableness\" review entails is not dictated by <i>Booker.</i> As I lamented then, \"[t]he worst feature of the scheme is that no one knows\u0097and perhaps no one is meant to know\u0097how advisory Guidelines and `unreasonableness' review will function in practice.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 311, 125 S.Ct. 738 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Earlier this Term, the Court intensified its silence when it declined to flesh out what it had in mind in the face of an argument that the form of reasonableness review had constitutional implications. In <i>Cunningham v. California,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007), Justice ALITO defended the constitutionality of California's sentencing system in part by arguing that, even post-<i>Booker,</i> some federal sentences will be upheld as reasonable only if the judge makes additional findings of fact beyond those encompassed by the jury verdict or guilty plea. 549 U.S., at ___, and n. 11, 127 S.Ct., at 867, and n. 11 (dissenting opinion). The <i>Cunningham</i> majority's response, much like the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion, was cryptic. While the Court did not explain <i>why</i> Justice ALITO was incorrect, it strongly intimated that his premise was wrong: that he had erroneously \"anticipate[d]\" how \"reasonableness review operates in practice.\" <i>Cunningham,</i> 549 U.S., at ___, n. 15, 127 S.Ct., at 870, n. 15. Because that question is squarely presented in this case that was then pending, the Court found it \"neither necessary nor proper ... to join issue with Justice ALITO on this matter,\" suggesting that all would be revealed in the opinion we issue today. See <i>id.,</i> at ___, n. 13, 127 S.Ct., at 868, n. 13.</p>\n<p>Today has arrived, and the Court has broken its promise. Nothing in the Court's opinion explains why, under the advisory Guidelines scheme, judge-found facts are <i>never</i> legally necessary to justify the sentence. By this I mean the Court has failed to establish that every sentence which will be imposed under the advisory Guidelines scheme could equally have been imposed had the judge relied upon no facts other than those found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. In fact, the Court implicitly, but quite plainly, acknowledges that this will not be the case, by treating as a permissible post-<i>Booker</i> claim petitioner's challenge of his within-Guidelines sentence as substantively excessive. See <i>ante,</i> at Part IV. Under the scheme promulgated today, some sentences reversed as excessive will be legally authorized in later cases only because additional judge-found facts are present; and, as Justice ALITO argued in <i>Cunningham,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2476</span> some lengthy sentences will be affirmed (<i>i.e.,</i> held lawful) only because of the presence of aggravating facts, not found by the jury, that distinguish the case from the mine-run. The Court does not even attempt to explain how this is consistent with the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>No explanation is given because no explanation is possible. The Court has reintroduced the constitutional defect that <i>Booker</i> purported to eliminate. I cannot acquiesce in this course. If a sentencing system is permissible in which some sentences cannot lawfully be imposed by a judge unless the judge finds certain facts by a preponderance of the evidence, then we should have left in place the compulsory Guidelines that Congress enacted, instead of imposing this jerry-rigged scheme of our own. In order to avoid the possibility of a Sixth Amendment violation, which was the object of the <i>Booker</i> remedy, district courts must be able, without finding any facts not embraced in the jury verdict or guilty plea, to sentence to the maximum of the <i>statutory</i> range. Because, therefore, appellate courts cannot reverse within-range sentences for being too high; and because no one would contend that Congress intended that sentences be reviewed only for being too low; I would hold that reasonableness review cannot contain a substantive component at all. I believe, however, that appellate courts can nevertheless secure some amount of sentencing uniformity through the procedural reasonableness review made possible by the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment requires that \"[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. Two hypotheticals will suffice to reveal why the notion of excessive sentences within the statutory range, and the ability of appellate courts to reverse such sentences, inexorably produces, in violation of the Sixth Amendment, sentences whose legality is premised on a judge's finding some fact (or combination of facts) by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p>First, consider two brothers with similar backgrounds and criminal histories who are convicted by a jury of respectively robbing two banks of an equal amount of money. Next assume that the district judge finds that one brother, fueled by racial animus, had targeted the first bank because it was owned and operated by minorities, whereas the other brother had selected the second bank simply because its location enabled a quick getaway. Further assume that the district judge imposes the statutory maximum upon both brothers, basing those sentences primarily upon his perception that bank robbery should be punished much more severely than the Guidelines base level advises, but explicitly noting that the racially biased decisionmaking of the first brother further justified his sentence. Now imagine that the appellate court reverses as excessive only the sentence of the nonracist brother. Given the dual holdings of the appellate court, the racist has a valid Sixth Amendment claim that his sentence was reasonable (and hence lawful) only because of the judicial finding of his motive in selecting his victim.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2477</span> Second, consider the common case in which the district court imposes a sentence <i>within</i> an advisory Guidelines range that has been substantially enhanced by certain judge-found facts. For example, the base offense level for robbery under the Guidelines is 20, United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B3.1(a) (Nov.2006), which, if the defendant has a criminal history of I, corresponds to an advisory range of 33-41 months, <i>id.,</i> ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. If, however, a judge finds that a firearm was discharged, that a victim incurred serious bodily injury, and that more than $5 million was stolen, then the base level jumps by 18, \u00a7\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2), (3), (7), producing an advisory range of 235-293 months, <i>id.,</i> ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. When a judge finds all of those facts to be true and then imposes a within-Guidelines sentence of 293 months, those judge-found facts, or some combination of them, are not merely facts that the judge finds relevant in exercising his discretion; they are the legally essential predicate for his imposition of the 293-month sentence. His failure to find them would render the 293-month sentence unlawful. That is evident because, were the district judge explicitly to find <i>none</i> of those facts true and nevertheless to impose a 293-month sentence (simply because he thinks robbery merits seven times the sentence that the Guidelines provide) the sentence would surely be reversed as unreasonably excessive.</p>\n<p>These hypotheticals are stylized ways of illustrating the basic problem with a system in which district courts lack full discretion to sentence within the statutory range. Under such a system, for every given crime there is some maximum sentence that will be upheld as reasonable based only on the facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. <i>Every</i> sentence higher than that is legally authorized only by some judge-found fact, in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Appellate courts' excessiveness review will explicitly or implicitly accept those judge-found facts as justifying sentences that would otherwise be unlawful. The only difference between this system and the pre-<i>Booker</i> mandatory Guidelines is that the maximum sentence based on the jury verdict or guilty plea was specified under the latter but must be established by appellate courts, in case-by-case fashion, under the former. This is, if anything, an additional constitutional disease, not a constitutional cure.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I am not suggesting that the Sixth Amendment prohibits judges from ever finding any facts. We have repeatedly affirmed the proposition that judges can find facts that help guide their discretion <i>within</i> the sentencing range that is authorized by the facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Booker, supra,</i> at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738; <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 481, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). But there is a fundamental difference, one underpinning our entire <i>Apprendi</i> jurisprudence, between facts that <i>must</i> be found in order for a sentence to be lawful, and facts that individual judges <i>choose</i> to make relevant to the exercise of their discretion. The former, but not the latter, must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in order \"to give intelligible content to the right of jury trial.\" <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 305, 124 S.Ct. 2531.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2478</span> I am also not contending that there is a Sixth Amendment problem with the Court's affirmation of a presumption of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentences. I agree with the Court that such a presumption never itself makes judge-found facts legally essential to the sentence imposed, since it has no direct relevance to whether the sentence would have been <i>unreasonable</i> in the <i>absence</i> of any judge-found facts. See <i>ante,</i> at 2465-2467.<sup>[3]</sup> Nor is my claim that the Sixth Amendment was violated in this case, for petitioner cannot demonstrate that his relatively low sentence would have been unreasonable if the District Court had relied on nothing but jury-found or admitted facts.</p>\n<p>Rather, my position is that there will inevitably be <i>some</i> constitutional violations under a system of substantive reasonableness review, because there will be some sentences that will be upheld as reasonable only because of the existence of judge-found facts. <i>Booker</i> itself reveals why that reality dooms the construct of reasonableness review established and applied by today's opinion. <i>Booker</i> made two things quite plain. First, reasonableness is the standard of review implicitly contained within the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984(SRA). 543 U.S., at 260-261, 125 S.Ct. 738. Second, Congress wanted a uniform system of sentencing review, rather than different schemes depending on whether there were Sixth Amendment problems in particular cases. <i>Id.,</i> at 265-267, 125 S.Ct. 738. Thus, if the contours of reasonableness review must be narrowed in <i>some</i> cases because of constitutional concerns, then they must be narrowed in <i>all</i> cases in light of Congress's desire for a uniform standard of review. The Justices composing today's Court were in total agreement with this principle of statutory interpretation the day <i>Booker</i> was decided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]hen deciding which of two plausible statutory constructions to adopt, a court must consider the necessary consequences of its choice. If one of them would raise a multitude of constitutional problems, the other should prevail\u0097 whether or not those constitutional problems pertain to the particular litigant before the Court.\" <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U.S. 371, 380-381, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005) (opinion for the Court by SCALIA, J., joined by, <i>inter alios,</i> STEVENS, KENNEDY, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ.).</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2479</span> Yet they now adopt substantive reasonableness review without offering any rebuttal to my charge of patent constitutional flaw inherent in such review. The one comfort to be found in the Court's opinion\u0097though it does not excuse the failure to apply <i>Martinez's</i> interpretive principle\u0097is that it does not rule out as-applied Sixth Amendment challenges to sentences that would not have been upheld as reasonable on the facts encompassed by the jury verdict or guilty plea. <i>Ante,</i> at 2466-2467; <i>ante,</i> at 2473 (STEVENS, J., joined by GINSBURG, J., concurring).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Had the Court bothered to frame objections to the constitutional analysis undertaken above, there are four conceivable candidates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>The most simplistic objection is that the Sixth Amendment is not violated because the judge-found facts are made legally necessary by the decision of appellate courts rather than the decision of Congress. This rebuttal errs both in premise and in conclusion.</p>\n<p>The premise is wrong because, according to the remedial majority in <i>Booker,</i> the facts that excessiveness review renders legally essential are made such by Congress. Reasonableness is the standard of review <i>implicitly</i> contained within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). See <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 260-261, 125 S.Ct. 738. But the Sixth Amendment would be violated even if appellate courts really were exercising some type of common-law power to prescribe the facts legally necessary to support specific sentences. Neither <i>Apprendi</i> nor any of its progeny suggests that violation of the Sixth Amendment depends upon what branch of government has made the prescription. To the contrary, <i>Booker</i> flatly rejected the argument that the mandatory Guidelines were constitutional because it was the Sentencing Commission rather than Congress that specified the facts essential to punishment. See 543 U.S., at 237-239, 125 S.Ct. 738. And for good reason. The Sixth Amendment is \"a reservation of jury power.\" <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 308, 124 S.Ct. 2531. It makes no difference whether it is a legislature, a Sentencing Commission, or an appellate court that usurps the jury's prerogative. Were it otherwise, this Court could prescribe that the only reasonable sentences are those consistent with the same mandatory Guidelines that <i>Booker</i> invalidated. And the California Supreme Court could effectively reverse our decision in <i>Cunningham</i> simply by setting aside as unreasonable any trial-court sentence that does not conform to pre-<i>Cunningham</i> California law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>The next objection minimizes the extent to which excessiveness review makes judge-found facts legally essential to punishment. If appellate courts will uphold, based only on the facts found by the jury, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2480</span> a district court's decision to impose all but the lengthiest sentences, then the number of sentences that are legally dependent on judge-found facts will be quite small. Thus, the argument goes, there is no reason to prohibit substantive reasonableness review altogether: Absent a claim that such review creates a constitutional problem in a given case, why prohibit it? I have already explained why this line of defense is inconsistent with established principles of statutory interpretation. See <i>supra,</i> at 2462-2464. But even on its own terms, the defense is inconsistent with <i>Booker</i> because reasonableness review is an improper and inadequate remedial scheme unless it ensures that judge-found facts are <i>never</i> legally necessary to justify the sentence imposed under the advisory Guidelines.</p>\n<p>The mandatory Guidelines system that was invalidated in <i>Booker</i> had the same attribute of producing unconstitutional results in only a small proportion of cases. Because of guilty pleas and Guidelines ranges that did not depend on judge-found facts, the overwhelming majority of sentences imposed under the pre-<i>Booker</i> federal system were perfectly in accord with the Sixth Amendment. See <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 248, 125 S.Ct. 738; <i>id.,</i> at 275-277, 125 S.Ct. 738 (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). <i>Booker</i> nevertheless excised key statutory provisions governing federal sentencing, <i>in order to eliminate constitutional violations entirely.</i> If our conjured-up system does not accomplish that goal, then by what right have we supplanted the congressionally enacted mandatory Guidelines?</p>\n<p>If it is true that some sentences under today's Court-prescribed system will still violate the Sixth Amendment, nonetheless allowing the system to go forward will produce chaos. Most cases do not resemble my stylized hypotheticals, and ordinarily defendants and judges will be unable to figure out, based on a comparison of the facts in their case with the facts of all of the previously decided appellate cases, whether the sentence imposed would have been upheld as reasonable based only on the facts supporting the jury verdict or guilty plea. That will not stop defendants from making the argument, however, and the Court certainly has not foreclosed them from trying. See <i>supra,</i> at 2463-2464, and n. 4. Judges will have in theory two options: create complicated charts and databases, based on appellate precedents, to ascertain what facts are legally essential to justify what sentences; or turn a deaf ear to these claims, though knowing full well that some of them are justified. I bet on the latter.<sup>[5]</sup> Things were better under the mandatory Guidelines system, where every judge could readily identify when the Sixth Amendment was being violated, and could rule accordingly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Proponents of substantive reasonableness review could next argue that actual sentencing involves the consideration of dozens of different facts in order to make an individualized determination about each defendant. In the real world, they would contend, it is difficult, if not impossible, to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2481</span> determine whether any given fact was legally essential to the punishment imposed. But identifying the particular fatal fact is not necessary to identifying a constitutional violation. In the second hypothetical given above, for example, it is not possible to say which single fact, or which combination of facts, sufficed to bring the sentence within the bounds of the \"reasonable.\" But it <i>is</i> possible to say (indeed, it <i>must</i> be said) that <i>some</i> judge-found fact or combination of facts had that effect\u0097and that suffices to establish a Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n<blockquote>\"Whether the judge's authority to impose an enhanced sentence depends on finding a specified fact ..., one of several specified facts ..., or <i>any</i> aggravating fact ..., it remains the case that the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence. The judge acquires that authority only upon finding some additional fact.\" <i>Blakely,</i> supra, at 305, 124 S.Ct. 2531</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4</h2>\n<p>The last conceivable defense of the Guidelines-light would be to wrap them in the mantle of history and tradition.</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]hen a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down. Such a venerable and accepted tradition is not to be laid on the examining table and scrutinized for its conformity to some abstract principle of [constitutional] adjudication devised by this Court. To the contrary, such traditions are themselves the stuff out of which the Court's principles are to be formed.\" <i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 95-96, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>This consideration has no application here. In the federal system, prior to the SRA, substantive appellate review of a district court's sentencing discretion essentially did not exist. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Dorszynski v. United States,</i> 418 U.S. 424, 431, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 41 L.Ed.2d 855 (1974) (noting \"the general proposition that once it is determined that a sentence is within the limitations set forth in the statute under which it is imposed, appellate review is at an end\"); <i>id.,</i> at 443, 94 S.Ct. 3042 (\"[W]ell-established doctrine bars review of the exercise of sentencing discretion\"). As for state appellate review of sentences, as late as 1962, at least 39 States did not permit appellate courts to modify sentences imposed within the statutory limits. See Appellate Review of Sentences, A Symposium at the Judicial Conference of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 32 F.R.D. 249, 260 (1962). It would be an exaggeration to say that history reflects an established understanding that appellate review of excessive sentences conflicts with the Sixth Amendment. But it would also be an exaggeration to say that the historical pedigree of substantive appellate review of sentencing is so strong and clear as to overcome the basic principle underlying the jury-trial right applied by this Court in <i>Apprendi, Blakely, Booker,</i> and <i>Cunningham.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>A final defense of substantive reasonableness review would be to invoke the intent of Congress or of the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion. As for congressional intent: <i>Of course</i> Congress intended that judge-found facts be legally essential to the punishment imposed; that was the whole reason the mandatory Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment. If we are now to indulge a newfound respect for unconstitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2482</span> congressional intent, we should reimpose the mandatory Guidelines system. The quasi-Guidelines system the Court creates today manages to contravene <i>both</i> congressional intent <i>and</i> the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>As for the \"intent\" of the Booker remedial opinion: That opinion purported to be divining congressional intent <i>in light of what the Sixth Amendment compelled.</i> See 543 U.S., at 263-265, 125 S.Ct. 738. Absent some explanation of why substantive reasonableness review does not cause judge-found facts to justify greater punishment than the jury's verdict or the defendant's guilty plea would sustain, I fail to understand how such review could possibly have been intended by all five Justices who composed the <i>Booker</i> remedial majority. After all, at least one of them did not intend \"to override <i>Blakely,</i> and to render academic the entire first part of <i>Booker</i> itself,\" and has confirmed that \"[t]here would have been no majority in <i>Booker</i> for the revision of <i>Blakely</i> essayed in [Justice ALITO's <i>Cunningham</i>] dissent.\" <i>Cunningham,</i> 549 U.S., at ___, n. 15, 127 S.Ct., at 870, n. 15 (opinion for the Court by GINSBURG, J.).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Abandoning substantive reasonableness review does not require a return to the pre-SRA regime that the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion sought to avoid. See 543 U.S., at 263-265, 125 S.Ct. 738. As I said at the outset, I believe it is possible to give some effect to the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion and the purposes that it sought to serve while still avoiding the constitutional defect identified in the <i>Booker</i> merits opinion. Specifically, I would limit reasonableness review to the sentencing <i>procedures</i> mandated by statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>A central feature of the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion was its conclusion that the SRA was not completely inseverable. See <i>id.,</i> at 258-265, 125 S.Ct. 738. As a result, the Sentencing Commission \"remains in place, writing Guidelines, collecting information about actual district court sentencing decisions, undertaking research, and revising the Guidelines accordingly.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. Likewise, sentencing courts remain obligated to consider the various factors delineated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), including the nowadvisory Guidelines range. 543 U.S., at 259-260, 125 S.Ct. 738. And they are still instructed by that subsection to \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of [that] subsection.\" Significantly, \u00a7 3553(c) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) continues to require that district courts give reasons for their sentencing decisions, a requirement the requisite detail of which depends on whether the sentence is: (1) within the advisory Guidelines range; (2) within an advisory Guidelines range that spans more than 24 months; or (3) outside the advisory Guidelines range. These explanations, in turn, help the Commission revise the advisory Guidelines to reflect actual sentencing practices consistent with the statutory goals. See <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV)).</p>\n<p><i>Booker</i>'s retention of these statutory procedural provisions furthered the congressional purpose of \"iron[ing] out sentencing differences,\" 543 U.S., at 263, 125 S.Ct. 738, and \"avoid[ing] excessive sentencing disparities,\" <i>id.,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. It is important that appellate courts police their observance. <i>Booker</i> excised the provision of the SRA containing the standards for appellate review, see <i>id.,</i> at 260, 125 S.Ct. 738 (invalidating 18 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2483</span> \u00a7 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV)), but the remedial majority's creation of reasonableness review gave appellate courts the necessary means to reverse a district court that: appears not to have considered \u00a7 3553(a); considers impermissible factors; selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts; or does not comply with \u00a7 3553(c)'s requirement for a statement of reasons.<sup>[6]</sup> In addition to its direct effect on sentencing uniformity, this procedural review will indirectly produce, over time, reduction of sentencing disparities. By ensuring that district courts give reasons for their sentences, and more specific reasons when they decline to follow the advisory Guidelines range, see \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), appellate courts will enable the Sentencing Commission to perform its function of revising the Guidelines to reflect the desirable sentencing practices of the district courts. See <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV)). And as that occurs, district courts will have less reason to depart from the Commission's recommendations, leading to more sentencing uniformity.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>One possible objection to procedural review that the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion appears not to have considered is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(f) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which limits appellate courts to reversing sentences that are imposed \"in violation of law\" or \"as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines,\" \u00a7 3742(f)(1), or that fall in certain categories and are either \"too high\" or \"too low,\" \u00a7 3742(f)(2).<sup>[8]</sup> But, as I noted in <i>Booker,</i> \u00a7 3742(e) and \u00a7 3742(f) are inextricably intertwined: Having excised \u00a7 3742(e)'s provisions setting forth the standards for appellate review, it is nonsensical to continue to apply \u00a7 3742(f)'s provisions governing the \"Decision and Disposition\" of appeals, which clearly track those now-excised standards. See 543 U.S., at 306-307, 125 S.Ct. 738 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part). I would hold that \u00a7 3742(f) is \"incapable of functioning independently\" of the provisions excised in <i>Booker,</i> and is thus inseverable from them. See <i>Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock,</i> 480 U.S. 678, 684, 107 S.Ct. 1476, 94 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2484</span> L.Ed.2d 661 (1987); 2 N. Singer, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 44:4, p. 576 (6th ed. 2001) (\"Even where part of an act is independent and valid, other parts which are not themselves substantively invalid but have no separate function to perform independent of the invalid portions of the act are also held invalid\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Applying procedural review in this case does not require much further discussion on my part. I join Part III of the Court's opinion. See <i>ante,</i> at 2468-2469.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Court's decision today leaves unexplained why the mandatory Guidelines were unconstitutional, but the Court-created substantive-review system that contains the same potential for Sixth Amendment violation is not. It is irresponsible to leave this patent inconsistency hanging in the air, threatening in the future yet another major revision of Guidelines practices to which the district courts and courts of appeals will have to adjust. Procedural review would lay the matter to rest, comporting with both parts of the <i>Booker</i> opinion and achieving the maximum degree of sentencing uniformity on the basis of judge-found facts that the Constitution permits.</p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Applying the Sixth Amendment to current sentencing law has gotten complicated, and someone coming cold to this case might wonder how we reached this point. A very general overview of the course of decisions over the past eight years may help to put today's holding in perspective.</p>\n<p>Members of a criminal jury are guaranteed to be impartial residents of the State and district of the crime, but the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury otherwise relies on history for details, and the practical instincts of judges and legislators for implementation in the courts. Litigation has, for example, worked through issues of size, see <i>Ballew v. Georgia,</i> 435 U.S. 223, 98 S.Ct. 1029, 55 L.Ed.2d 234 (1978) (prohibiting five-person state juries but allowing juries of six), and unanimity, see <i>Apodaca v. Oregon,</i> 406 U.S. 404, 92 S.Ct. 1628, 32 L.Ed.2d 184 (1972) (allowing nonunanimous juries in state criminal trials); <i>Burch v. Louisiana,</i> 441 U.S. 130, 99 S.Ct. 1623, 60 L.Ed.2d 96 (1979) (prohibiting nonunanimous six-person juries). Such decisions go to what William James would have called the \"cash-value\" of the Constitution's guarantee. See W. James, Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking 200 (1st ed.1907).</p>\n<p>One additional issue of both detail and implementation is the line between judge and jury in determining facts, and in particular the legitimate extent of factfinding by a judge when sentencing a defendant after a guilty plea or a jury's verdict of guilty. Since the very inception of judicial discretion in determining a sentence, judges have acted on what they learn in the course of a trial (and later what they gather from a presentence report or other evidence at time of sentencing), including details a trial jury may not have found to be true when it returned the guilty verdict or answered a special question. But historically, also, the customary judicial use of these extraverdict facts has been in deciding on a sentence within a range set in advance by the statute defining the crime in question. See <i>Williams v. New York,</i> 337 U.S. 241, 246-247, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). Thus, traditionally when a judge imposed a sentence at some point in the range, say, of 0-to-5 years specified by statute for some offense, every fact necessary to go as high as five <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2485</span> years had been found by the jury (or admitted), even though the jury had not made particular or implicit findings of the facts the judge might consider in exercising discretion to set the sentence higher or lower within the 5-year range.</p>\n<p>It was against this background, in <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), that we called attention to a serious threat to the practical value of a criminal defendant's jury right. Jones had been prosecuted under a statute that exemplified a growing practice of providing a definition and penalty for some basic crime subject to the right of jury trial, but then identifying variants carrying higher ranges of penalties depending on facts that arguably might be found by a judge sitting alone. Thus, Jones was convicted solely of carjacking, but if the further fact of causing \"`serious bodily injury'\" was shown, the maximum penalty jumped from 15 years to 25. <i>Id.,</i> at 230, 119 S.Ct. 1215 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 (1988 ed., Supp. V)). The Government's position was that the extra fact of serious bodily injury raising the penalty range required no jury finding because it was only a condition for imposing an enhanced sentence, up to a judge, not an element of a more serious crime, subject to the right to a jury's determination. See <i>Jones,</i> 526 U.S., at 233, 119 S.Ct. 1215.</p>\n<p>It was an unsettling argument, because in prosecutions under these statutory schemes the most serious issue in the case might well be not guilt or innocence of the basic offense, but liability to the substantially enhanced penalty. If, for example, the judge found that Jones had caused not just serious bodily injury, but death, such extraverdict factfinding could have made the difference between 15 years and life imprisonment. <i>Id.,</i> at 230, 119 S.Ct. 1215 (quoting \u00a7 2119 (1988 ed., Supp. V)). In a case like that, giving judges the exclusive power to find the facts necessary to sentence in the higher range would make the jury a mere gatekeeper to the more important trial before a judge alone. <i>Id.,</i> at 243-244, 119 S.Ct. 1215. The Sixth Amendment does not, of course, speak expressly to such a scheme, but that is not a sufficient reason to give it constitutional approval. For if judicial factfinding necessary for an enhanced sentencing range were held to be adequate in the face of a defendant's objection, a defendant's right to have a jury standing between himself and the power of the government to curtail his liberty would take on a previously unsuspected modesty.</p>\n<p><i>Jones</i> accordingly treated this practice as suspect enough to call for applying the doctrine of constitutional avoidance when the Court interpreted the statute in question. What the Government called a mere condition for imposing a sentencing enhancement was treated as an element of a more serious offense and made subject to a jury's factfinding. This interpretation obviated the constitutional decision whether subjecting an unwilling defendant to a more onerous range of sentence on facts found solely by a judge would violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The issue did not go away with <i>Jones,</i> and the constitutional challenge was soon presented inescapably, in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We held that exposing a defendant to an increased penalty beyond the range for a basic crime, based on facts determined exclusively by a judge, violated the Sixth Amendment, in the absence of a jury waiver; a defendant could not be subjected to a penalty more serious than one authorized by the facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2486</span> <i>Id.,</i> at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.<sup>[1]</sup> A judge could constitutionally determine facts for exercising discretion in sentencing up to that point, but a fact that raised the range of possible penalties functioned like an element of a more serious offense, even if a statute ostensibly tied that fact to the sentence alone. Hence, in the absence of waiver, a sentence in that weightier range could be imposed by a judge only if the enhancing fact was found beyond a reasonable doubt by the trial jury. <i>Ibid.</i> In placing disputed factfinding off judicial limits when, but only when, its effect would be to raise the range of possible sentences, we made a practical judgment that maintained the historical judicial role in finding facts relevant to sentencing within the range set by a jury's verdict, but we recognized that the jury right would be trivialized beyond recognition if that traditional practice could be extended to the point that a judge alone (over objection) could find a fact necessary to raise the upper limit of a sentencing range.</p>\n<p>From the moment <i>Apprendi</i> drew that line, however, its holding carried apparent implications for the regime of Guidelines sentencing adopted in 1984, see Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat.1987, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). The general object of Guidelines sentencing was the eminently laudable one of promoting substantial consistency in exercising judicial discretion to sentence within the range set by statute for a given crime. Thus, at the elementary level, the Guidelines law limits the sentence that a judge may impose even within the sentencing range provided by the statute creating a particular offense. In effect, it divides a basic sentencing range into subranges and assigns an offender to a subrange based on the particular facts of the case and the offender's criminal history. A judge may depart from the assigned subrange only if the case presents a circumstance \"not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). It follows that a judge must find facts beyond those necessary for the jury's guilty verdict to sentence above (or below, for that matter) the subrange designated for an offender with a comparable criminal history whose case presents no relevant facts beyond the formal elements of the crime itself. The result is a hybrid sentencing practice. One could describe it by emphasizing that the judge's factfinding could never increase the sentence beyond the range set by the law defining the crime, or one could stress that a principal motivation for Guidelines sentencing is eliminating some traditional judicial discretion by forbidding a judge to impose a high sentence except on the basis of some fact beyond those necessary for a guilty verdict (and thus subject to the right to a jury's determination).</p>\n<p>In <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), considering a state sentencing system similar to the federal scheme, we decided that the latter way of looking at it made more sense, if <i>Apprendi</i> was going to mean something in preserving the historical significance of the jury. See 542 U.S., at 305-306, 124 S.Ct. 2531. We held that the additional factfinding necessary for a judge to sentence within a high subrange was comparable to the finding of additional fact required for a judge to impose an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2487</span> enhanced sentence under the law considered in <i>Apprendi.</i> If <i>Blakely</i> had come out the other way, the significance of <i>Apprendi</i> itself would be in jeopardy: a legislature would be free to bypass <i>Apprendi</i> by providing an abnormally spacious sentencing range for any basic crime (theoretically exposing a defendant to the highest sentence just by the jury's guilty verdict), then leaving it to a judge to make supplementary findings not only appropriate but necessary for a sentence in a subrange at the high end. That would spell the end of <i>Apprendi</i> and diminish the real significance of jury protection that <i>Apprendi</i> had shored up.</p>\n<p>In <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a majority of the Court applied <i>Blakely</i>'s reasoning and held that the Federal Guidelines, too, subjected defendants to unconstitutional sentences in upper subranges, absent a jury finding or waiver. So far, so good for the Sixth Amendment, but there was the further issue of remedy, and at that step consistency began to falter. If statutory Guidelines were to survive, there were two serious alternatives. One was already in place in courts with the foresight to apply <i>Apprendi</i> to the Guidelines: require any additional facts necessary for a possible high subrange sentence to be charged and submitted to the jury. True, the Government would have to think ahead (and could not charge relevant facts that emerged unexpectedly at trial). But the mandatory character of the Guidelines would be preserved, the goal of consistency would continue to be served, and the practical value of the jury right would not face erosion.</p>\n<p>The second remedial alternative was a declaration by the Court that the Guidelines were not mandatory but discretionary, so that finding extraverdict facts was not strictly necessary for sentencing in a high subrange under the Guidelines. On this alternative, a judge who found a subsidiary fact specified as a condition for a high subrange sentence might decide to impose a low sentence (independently of the Guidelines' own provisions for downward departure), and a judge who found no such fact might sentence within the high subrange for other reasons that seemed sufficient. If the Guidelines were not mandatory, the subsidiary fact merely provided one reasoned basis for a traditional exercise of discretion to sentence at the high end of the sentencing range provided by the statute defining the crime.</p>\n<p>But that second alternative could not be so simple: it raised yet further issues, and the reconfigured majority of the Court that in fact adopted it, see 543 U.S., at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, guaranteed that we would have the case now before us. If district judges treated the now-discretionary Guidelines simply as worthy of consideration but open to rejection in any given case, the <i>Booker</i> remedy would threaten a return to the old sentencing regime and would presumably produce the apparent disuniformity that convinced Congress to adopt Guidelines sentencing in the first place. But if sentencing judges attributed substantial gravitational pull to the now-discretionary Guidelines, if they treated the Guidelines result as persuasive or presumptively appropriate, the <i>Booker</i> remedy would in practical terms preserve the very feature of the Guidelines that threatened to trivialize the jury right. For a presumption of Guidelines reasonableness would tend to produce Guidelines sentences almost as regularly as mandatory Guidelines had done, with judges finding the facts needed for a sentence in an upper subrange. This would open the door to undermining <i>Apprendi</i> itself, and this is what has happened today.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2488</span> Without a powerful reason to risk reversal on the sentence, a district judge faced with evidence supporting a high subrange Guidelines sentence will do the appropriate factfinding in disparagement of the jury right and will sentence within the high subrange. This prediction is weakened not a whit by the Court's description of within-Guidelines reasonableness as an \"appellate\" presumption, <i>ante,</i> at 2464-2465 (emphasis deleted). What works on appeal determines what works at trial, and if the Sentencing Commission's views are as weighty as the Court says they are, see <i>ante,</i> at 2463-2465, a trial judge will find it far easier to make the appropriate findings and sentence within the appropriate Guideline, than to go through the unorthodox factfinding necessary to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The upshot is that today's decision moves the threat to the practical value of the Sixth Amendment jury right closer to what it was when this Court flagged it in <i>Jones,</i> and it seems fair to ask just what has been accomplished in real terms by all the judicial labor imposed by <i>Apprendi</i> and its associated cases.</p>\n<p>Taking the <i>Booker</i> remedy (of discretionary Guidelines) as a given, however, the way to avoid further risk to <i>Apprendi</i> and the jury right is to hold that a discretionary within-Guidelines sentence carries no presumption of reasonableness. Only if sentencing decisions are reviewed according to the same standard of reasonableness whether or not they fall within the Guidelines range will district courts be assured that the entire sentencing range set by statute is available to them. See <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 263, 125 S.Ct. 738 (calling for a reasonableness standard \"across the board\"). And only then will they stop replicating the unconstitutional system by imposing appeal-proof sentences within the Guidelines ranges determined by facts found by them alone.</p>\n<p>I would therefore reject the presumption of reasonableness adopted in this case, not because it is pernicious in and of itself, but because I do not think we can recognize such a presumption and still retain the full effect of <i>Apprendi</i> in aid of the Sixth Amendment guarantee. But I would not stop at rejecting the presumption. Neither my preferred course nor the choice of today's majority can avoid being at odds to some degree with the intent of Congress; there is no question that Congress meant to impose mandatory Guidelines as the means of bringing greater uniformity to sentencing. So I point out that the congressional objective can still be attained, but that <i>Booker's</i> remedial holding means that only Congress can restore the scheme to what it had in mind, and in a way that gives full measure to the right to a jury trial. If Congress has not had a change of heart about the value of a Guidelines system, it can reenact the Guidelines law to give it the same binding force it originally had, but with provision for jury, not judicial, determination of any fact necessary for a sentence within an upper Guidelines subrange. At this point, only Congress can make good on both its enacted policy of mandatory Guidelines sentencing and the guarantee of a robust right of jury trial.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  See 543 U.S., at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738 (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.) (\"We have never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range. Indeed, everyone agrees that the constitutional issues presented by these cases would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the [Sentencing Reform Act of 1984] the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges\" (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>[2]  In fact, <i>Booker</i> expressly equated the new \"reasonableness\" standard with the old abuse-of-discretion standard used to review sentencing departures. See <i>id.,</i> at 262, 125 S.Ct. 738 (\"`Reasonableness' standards are not foreign to sentencing law. The Act has long required their use in important sentencing circumstances\u0097both <i>on review of departures,</i> see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(3) (1994 ed.), and on review of sentences imposed where there was no applicable Guideline, see \u00a7\u00a7 3742(a)(4), (b)(4), (e)(4)\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>[3]  See also Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Key Compromises Upon Which They Rest, 17 Hofstra L.Rev. 1, 19-20 (1988) (\"The Commission extensively debated which offender characteristics should make a difference in sentencing; that is, which characteristics were important enough to warrant formal reflection within the Guidelines and which should constitute possible grounds for departure .... Eventually, in light of the arguments based in part on considerations of fairness and in part on the uncertainty as to how a sentencing judge would actually account for the aggravating and/or mitigating factors ... the current offender characteristics rules look primarily to past records of convictions\" (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p>[1]  Of course, it may be that some fact other than racial animus would also have sufficed to sustain the increased sentence. But it is undeniable that in the case at hand the judicial finding of racial animus filled that role. See <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 305, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p>[2]  For similar reasons, I recognize that the Sixth Amendment problem with reasonableness review is created only by the lack of district court discretion to impose <i>high</i> sentences, since eliminating discretion to impose <i>low</i> sentences is the equivalent of judicially creating mandatory minimums, which are not a concern of the Sixth Amendment. See <i>Harris v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 545, 568-569, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). But since reasonableness review should not function as a one-way ratchet, <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 257-258, 266, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we must forswear the notion that sentences can be too low in light of the need to abandon the concept that sentences can be too high.</p>\n<p>[3]  For this reason, I do not join Justice SOUTER's dissent. He wishes to give \"district courts [assurance] that the entire sentencing range set by statute is available to them.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2488. That is a proper goal\u0097indeed, an essential one to prevent the <i>Booker</i> remedy from effectively overturning <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Blakely.</i> But eliminating the presumption of reasonableness will not achieve it. In those Circuits that <i>already</i> decline to employ the presumption, a within-Guidelines sentence has <i>never</i> been reversed as substantively excessive, Brief for New York Council of Defense Lawyers as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 5, refuting the belief that mere elimination of the presumption will destroy the \"gravitational pull,\" <i>post,</i> at 2487 (SOUTER, J., dissenting), to stay safely within the Guidelines. The only way to assure district courts that they can deviate from the advisory Guidelines, and to ensure that judge-found facts are never legally essential to the sentence, is to prohibit appellate courts from reviewing the <i>substantive</i> sentencing choices made by district courts.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Court suggests that my reliance on hypotheticals indicates that its interpretation of reasonableness will not create a multitude of constitutional problems. <i>Ante,</i> at 2466; see also <i>ante,</i> at 2473 (STEVENS, J., concurring). Setting aside the question whether the volume of constitutional violations has any relevance to the application of <i>Martinez's</i> interpretive principle, the Court is wrong to think that the constitutional problem today's opinion ignores is hypothetical, merely because I have used hypotheticals to describe it. It is all too real that advisory Guidelines sentences routinely change months and years of imprisonment to decades and centuries on the basis of judge-found facts\u0097as <i>Booker</i> itself recognized, see 543 U.S., at 236-237, 125 S.Ct. 738 (citing, <i>inter alia,</i> a case in which a defendant's sentence increased from 57 months to 155 years).</p>\n<p>[5]  Perhaps I am too cynical. At least one conscientious District Judge has decided to shoulder the burden of ascertaining what the maximum reasonable sentence is in each case based only on the verdict and appellate precedent, correctly concluding that this is the <i>only</i> way to eliminate Sixth Amendment problems after <i>Cunningham</i> if <i>Booker</i> mandates substantive reasonableness review. See <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> No. 05-10175-WGY, ___ F.Supp.2d ___, 2007 WL 1620526, *13-*14 (D.Mass., June 6, 2007) (Young, D.J.) (Sentencing Memorandum).</p>\n<p>[6]  \"Substance\" and \"procedure\" are admittedly chameleon-like terms. See <i>Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman,</i> 486 U.S. 717, 726-727, 108 S.Ct. 2117, 100 L.Ed.2d 743 (1988). As the text indicates, my use of the term \"procedure\" here includes the limiting of sentencing factors to permissible ones\u0097as opposed to using permissible factors but reaching a result that is \"substantively\" wrong. I therefore disagree with Justice STEVENS that a district court which discriminates against Yankees fans is acting in a procedurally \"impeccable\" way. <i>Ante,</i> at 2473 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p>[7]  Courts must resist, however, the temptation to make procedural review more stringent because substantive review is off the table. The judicial role when conducting severability analysis is limited to determining whether the balance of a statute that contains an unconstitutional provision is capable \"of functioning independently.\" <i>Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock,</i> 480 U.S. 678, 684, 107 S.Ct. 1476, 94 L.Ed.2d 661 (1987). Courts have no power to add provisions that might be desirable now that certain provisions have been excised. Thus, when engaging in reasonableness review to determine whether the district court has complied with the various procedures in \u00a7 3553, an appellate court cannot subject the district court to any greater requirements than existed pre-<i>Booker.</i></p>\n<p>[8]  I say \"possible\" because one could claim that the failure to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553's procedural requirements results in a sentence imposed in violation of law, and thereby covered by \u00a7 3742(f)(1). But \u00a7 3742(f)(1)'s applicability to such procedural errors is called into question by \u00a7 3742(f)(2), which specifically addresses sentences where \"the district court failed to provide the required statement of reasons [mandated by \u00a7 3553(c)(2)].\" For the reasons specified in the text, however, I see no need to grapple, post-<i>Booker,</i> with the proper interpretation of \u00a7 3742(f).</p>\n<p>[1]  We recognized a single exception to this rule, permitting reliance on the fact of a prior conviction without a jury determination that the defendant had previously been convicted. See <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S., at 489-490, 120 S.Ct. 2348; see also <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p>[2]  Because I would ask the Court of Appeals to review the sentence for reasonableness without resort to any presumption, I would not reach the other issues in this case.</p>\n\n</div>",

Statutes then\n tell the Commission to write Guidelines that will carry out the same\n basic \u00a73553(a) objectives. The Guidelines as written reflect the fact\n that the Sentencing Commission examined tens of thousands of sen-\n tences and had the help of the law enforcement community over a\n long period in an effort to fulfill this statutory mandate. They also\n reflect the fact that judges (and others) can differ as to how best to\n reconcile the disparate ends of punishment. The resulting Guidelines\n2                        RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    seek to embody the \u00a73553(a) considerations, both in principle and in\n    practice, and it is fair to assume that they, insofar as practicable, re-\n    flect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve\n    \u00a73553(a)\u2019s objectives. An individual sentence reflects the sentencing\n    judge\u2019s determination that the Commission\u2019s application of \u00a73553(a)\n    is appropriate in the mine run of cases, that the individual case does\n    not differ significantly, and consequently that a Guidelines sentence\n    reflects a proper application of \u00a73553(a) in the case at hand. The\n    \u201creasonableness\u201d presumption simply recognizes these real-world cir-\n    cumstances. It applies only on appellate review. The sentencing\n    court does not enjoy the presumption\u2019s benefit when determining the\n    merits of the arguments by prosecution or defense that a Guidelines\n    sentence should not apply. Pp. 7\u201312.\n          (b) Even if the presumption increases the likelihood that the\n    judge, not the jury, will find \u201csentencing facts,\u201d it does not violate the\n    Sixth Amendment. This Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment cases do not for-\n    bid a sentencing court to take account of factual matters not deter-\n    mined by a jury and increase the sentence accordingly to take ac-\n    count of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s factual findings or\n    recommended sentences. The relevant Sixth Amendment inquiry is\n    whether a law forbids a judge to increase a sentence unless the judge\n    finds facts that the jury did not find. A nonbinding appellate reason-\n    ableness presumption for Guidelines sentences does not require the\n    sentencing judge to impose a Guidelines sentence. Still less does it\n    forbid the judge to impose a sentence higher than the Guidelines pro-\n    vide for the jury-determined facts standing alone. In addition, any\n    general conflict between \u00a73353(a) and the Guidelines for appellate\n    review purposes is alleviated where judge and Commission both de-\n    termine that the Guidelines sentence is appropriate in the case at\n    hand, for that sentence likely reflects \u00a73353(a)\u2019s factors. Pp. 12\u201316.\n       2. The District Court properly analyzed the relevant sentencing\n    factors, and given the record, its ultimate sentence was reasonable.\n    Section 3353(c) calls for the judge to \u201cstate\u201d his \u201creasons,\u201d but does\n    not insist on a full opinion in every case. The appropriateness of\n    brevity or length, conciseness or detail, when to write, what to say,\n    depends upon circumstances. The law leaves much, in this respect,\n    to the judge\u2019s own professional judgment. In the present context, the\n    sentencing judge should articulate enough to satisfy the appellate\n    court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a rea-\n    soned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\n    He may say less when his decision rests upon the Commission\u2019s own\n    reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is proper in the typical case,\n    and the judge has found that the case before him is typical. But\n    where a party presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different\n                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  sentence, the judge will normally go further and explain why he has\n  rejected those arguments. Here, the sentencing judge\u2019s statement of\n  reasons was brief but legally sufficient. The record makes clear that\n  the judge listened to each of Rita\u2019s arguments for a downward depar-\n  ture and considered the supporting evidence before finding those cir-\n  cumstances insufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the Guide-\n  lines range. Where, as here, the matter is conceptually simple and\n  the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evi-\n  dence and arguments, the law does not require a judge to write more\n  extensively. Pp. 16\u201320.\n     3. The Fourth Circuit, after applying the presumption, was legally\n  correct in holding that Rita\u2019s sentence was not \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Like\n  the District Court and the Fourth Circuit, this Court simply cannot\n  say that Rita\u2019s special circumstances\u2014his health, fear of retaliation,\n  and military record\u2014are special enough, in light of \u00a73553(a), to re-\n  quire a sentence lower than the one the Guidelines provide. Rita\u2019s\n  argument that the Guidelines sentence is not reasonable under\n  \u00a73553(a) because it expressly declines to consider various personal\n  characteristics, such as his physical condition, employment record,\n  and military service, was not raised below and will not be considered\n  here.

RITA, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n                                [June 21, 2007]\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The federal courts of appeals review federal sentences\nand set aside those they find \u201cunreasonable.\u201d See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 261\u2013263 (2005).\nSeveral Circuits have held that, when doing so, they will\npresume that a sentence imposed within a properly calcu-\nlated United States Sentencing Guidelines range is a\nreasonable sentence. See, e.g., 177 Fed. Appx. 357, 358\n(CA4 2006) (per curiam) (case below); see also United\nStates Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov.\n2006) (USSG or Guidelines). The most important question\nbefore us is whether the law permits the courts of appeals\nto use this presumption. We hold that it does.\n                              I\n                              A\n  The basic crime in this case concerns two false state-\nments which Victor Rita, the petitioner, made under oath\nto a federal grand jury. The jury was investigating a gun\ncompany called InterOrdnance. Prosecutors believed that\nbuyers of an InterOrdnance kit, called a \u201cPPSH 41 ma-\nchinegun \u2018parts kit,\u2019 \u201d could assemble a machinegun from\nthe kit, that those kits consequently amounted to ma-\n2                  RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nchineguns, and that InterOrdnance had not secured\nproper registrations for the importation of the guns. App.\n7, 16\u201319, 21\u201322.\n   Rita had bought a PPSH 41 machinegun parts kit. Rita,\nwhen contacted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\nFirearms and Explosives (ATF), agreed to let a federal\nagent inspect the kit. Id., at 119\u2013120; Supp. App. 5\u20138.\nBut before meeting with the agent, Rita called InterOrd-\nnance and then sent back the kit. He subsequently turned\nover to ATF a different kit that apparently did not amount\nto a machinegun. App. 23\u201324, 120; Supp. App. 2\u20135, 8\u201310,\n13\u201314.\n   The investigating prosecutor brought Rita before the\ngrand jury, placed him under oath, and asked him about\nthese matters. Rita denied that the Government agent\nhad asked him for the PPSH kit, and also denied that he\nhad spoken soon thereafter about the PPSH kit to some-\none at InterOrdnance. App. 19, 120\u2013121; Supp. App. 11\u2013\n12. The Government claimed these statements were false,\ncharged Rita with perjury, making false statements, and\nobstructing justice, and, after a jury trial, obtained convic-\ntions on all counts. App. 7\u201313, 94, 103.\n                               B\n  The parties subsequently proceeded to sentencing.\nInitially, a probation officer, with the help of the parties,\nand after investigating the background both of the of-\nfenses and of the offender, prepared a presentence report.\nSee Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 32(c)\u2013(d); 18 U. S. C. \u00a73552(a).\nThe completed report describes \u201coffense characteristics,\u201d\n\u201coffender characteristics,\u201d and other matters that might be\nrelevant to the sentence, and then calculates a Guidelines\nsentence. The report also sets forth factors potentially\nrelevant to a departure from the Guidelines or relevant to\nthe imposition of an other-than-Guidelines sentence. It\nultimately makes a sentencing recommendation based on\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Guidelines. App. 115\u2013136.\n  In respect to \u201coffense characteristics,\u201d for example, the\nreport points out that the five counts of conviction all stem\nfrom a single incident. Id., at 122. Hence, pursuant to the\nGuidelines, the report, in calculating a recommended\nsentence, groups the five counts of conviction together,\ntreating them as if they amounted to the single most\nserious count among them (and ignoring all others). See\nUSSG \u00a73D1.1. The single most serious offense in Rita\u2019s\ncase is \u201cperjury.\u201d The relevant Guideline, \u00a72J1.3(c)(1),\ninstructs the sentencing court (and the probation officer)\nto calculate the Guidelines sentence for \u201cperjury . . . in\nrespect to a criminal offense\u201d by applying the Guideline for\nan \u201caccessory after the fact,\u201d as to that criminal offense.\n\u00a72X3.1. And that latter Guideline says that the judge, for\ncalculation purposes, should take as a base offense level, a\nlevel that is \u201c6 levels lower than the offense level for the\nunderlying offense,\u201d (emphasis added) (the offense that the\nperjury may have helped someone commit). Here the\n\u201cunderlying offense\u201d consisted of InterOrdnance\u2019s possible\nviolation of the machinegun registration law. App. 124;\nUSSG \u00a72M5.2 (providing sentence for violation of 22\nU. S. C. \u00a72778(b)(2), importation of defense articles with-\nout authorization). The base offense level for the gun\nregistration crime is 26. See USSG \u00a72M5.2. Six levels\nless is 20. And 20, says the presentence report, is the base\noffense level applicable to Rita for purposes of Guidelines\nsentence calculation. App. 45.\n  The presentence report next considers Rita\u2019s \u201cCriminal\nHistory.\u201d Id., at 125. Rita was convicted in May 1986,\nand sentenced to five years\u2019 probation for making false\nstatements in connection with the purchase of firearms.\nBecause this conviction took place more than 10 years\nbefore the present offense, it did not count against Rita.\nAnd because Rita had no other relevant convictions, the\nGuidelines considered him as having no \u201ccriminal history\n4                  RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npoints.\u201d Ibid. The report consequently places Rita in\ncriminal history category I, the lowest category for pur-\nposes of calculating a Guidelines\u2019 sentence.\n  The report goes on to describe other \u201cOffender Charac-\nteristics.\u201d Id., at 126. The description includes Rita\u2019s\npersonal and family data, Rita\u2019s physical condition (includ-\ning a detailed description of ailments), Rita\u2019s mental and\nemotional health, the lack of any history of substance\nabuse, Rita\u2019s vocational and nonvocational education, and\nRita\u2019s employment record. It states that he served in the\nArmed Forces for over 25 years, on active duty and in the\nReserve. During that time he received 35 commendations,\nawards, or medals of different kinds. The report analyzes\nRita\u2019s financial condition. Id., at 126\u2013132.\n  Ultimately, the report calculates the Guidelines sen-\ntencing range. Id., at 132. The Guidelines specify for base\nlevel 20, criminal history category I, a sentence of 33-to-41\nmonths\u2019 imprisonment. Ibid. The report adds that there\n\u201cappears to be no circumstance or combination of circum-\nstances that warrant a departure from the prescribed\nsentencing guidelines.\u201d Id., at 133.\n                             C\n  At the sentencing hearing, both Rita and the Govern-\nment presented their sentencing arguments. Each side\naddressed the report. Rita argued for a sentence outside\n(and lower than) the recommended Guidelines 33-to-41\nmonth range.\n  The judge made clear that Rita\u2019s argument for a lower\nsentence could take either of two forms. First, Rita might\nargue within the Guidelines\u2019 framework, for a departure\nfrom the applicable Guidelines range on the ground that\nhis circumstances present an \u201catypical case\u201d that falls\noutside the \u201cheartland\u201d to which the United States Sen-\ntencing Commission intends each individual Guideline to\napply. USSG \u00a75K2.0(a)(2). Second, Rita might argue that,\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nindependent of the Guidelines, application of the sentenc-\ning factors set forth in 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a) (2000 ed. and\nSupp. IV) warrants a lower sentence. See Booker, 543\nU. S., at 259\u2013260.\n  Thus, the judge asked Rita\u2019s counsel, \u201cAre you going to\nput on evidence to show that [Rita] should be getting a\ndownward departure, or under 3553, your client would be\nentitled to a different sentence than he should get under\nsentencing guidelines?\u201d App. 52. And the judge later\nsummarized:\n       \u201c[Y]ou\u2019re asking for a departure from the guidelines\n    or a sentence under 3553 that is lower than the guide-\n    lines, and here are the reasons:\n       \u201cOne, he is a vulnerable defendant because he\u2019s\n    been involved in [government criminal justice] work\n    which has caused people to become convicted crimi-\n    nals who are in prison and there may be retribution\n    against him.\n       \u201cTwo, his military experience . . . . \u201d Id., at 64\u201365.\nCounsel agreed, while adding that Rita\u2019s poor physical\ncondition constituted a third reason. And counsel said\nthat he rested his claim for a lower sentence on \u201c[j]ust\n[those] three\u201d special circumstances, \u201c[p]hysical condition,\nvulnerability in prison and the military service.\u201d Id., at\n65. Rita presented evidence and argument related to\nthese three factors. The Government, while not asking for\na sentence higher than the report\u2019s recommended Guide-\nlines range, said that Rita\u2019s perjury had interfered with\nthe Government\u2019s potential \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d claim\nagainst InterOrdnance and that Rita, as a former Gov-\nernment criminal justice employee, should have known\nbetter than to commit perjury. Id., at 74\u201377. The sentenc-\ning judge asked questions about each factor.\n   After hearing the arguments, the judge concluded that\nhe was \u201cunable to find that the [report\u2019s recommended]\n6                  RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsentencing guideline range . . . is an inappropriate guide-\nline range for that, and under 3553 . . . the public needs to\nbe protected if it is true, and I must accept as true the jury\nverdict.\u201d Id., at 87. The court concluded: \u201cSo the Court\nfinds that it is appropriate to enter\u201d a sentence at the\nbottom of the Guidelines range, namely a sentence of\nimprisonment \u201cfor a period of 33 months.\u201d Ibid.\n                             D\n   On appeal, Rita argued that his 33-month sentence was\n\u201cunreasonable\u201d because (1) it did not adequately take\naccount of \u201cthe defendant\u2019s history and characteristics,\u201d\nand (2) it \u201cis greater than necessary to comply with the\npurposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(2).\u201d\nBrief for Appellant in No. 05\u20134674 (CA4), pp. i, 8. The\nFourth Circuit observed that it must set aside a sentence\nthat is not \u201creasonable.\u201d The Circuit stated that \u201ca sen-\ntence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines\nrange . . . is presumptively reasonable.\u201d It added that\n\u201cwhile we believe that the appropriate circumstances for\nimposing a sentence outside the guideline range will\ndepend on the facts of individual cases, we have no reason\nto doubt that most sentences will continue to fall within\nthe applicable guideline range.\u201d The Fourth Circuit then\nrejected Rita\u2019s arguments and upheld the sentence. Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n                              E\n  Rita petitioned for a writ of certiorari. He pointed out\nthat the Circuits are split as to the use of a presumption of\nreasonableness for within-Guidelines sentences. Compare\nUnited States v. Dorcely, 454 F. 3d 366, 376 (CADC 2006)\n(uses presumption); United States v. Green, 436 F. 3d 449,\n457 (CA4 2006) (same); United States v.

Talley, 431 F. 3d 784, 788 (CA11 2005) (per cu-\nriam) (same).\n  We consequently granted Rita\u2019s petition. We agreed to\ndecide whether a circuit court may afford a \u201cpresumption\nof reasonableness\u201d to a \u201cwithin-Guidelines\u201d sentence. We\nalso agreed to decide whether the District Court properly\nanalyzed the relevant sentencing factors and whether,\ngiven the record, the District Court\u2019s ultimate choice of a\n33-month sentence was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d\n                             II\n  The first question is whether a court of appeals may\napply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court\nsentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentenc-\ning Guidelines. We conclude that it can.\n                              A\n  For one thing, the presumption is not binding. It does\nnot, like a trial-related evidentiary presumption, insist\nthat one side, or the other, shoulder a particular burden of\npersuasion or proof lest they lose their case. C.f., e.g.,\nRaytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U. S. 44, 49\u201350, n. 3\n(2003) (citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products,\nInc., 530 U. S. 133, 143 (2000), and McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 802 (1973)). Nor does the\npresumption reflect strong judicial deference of the kind\nthat leads appeals courts to grant greater factfinding\nleeway to an expert agency than to a district judge.\n8                  RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nRather, the presumption reflects the fact that, by the time\nan appeals court is considering a within-Guidelines sen-\ntence on review, both the sentencing judge and the Sen-\ntencing Commission will have reached the same conclu-\nsion as to the proper sentence in the particular case. That\ndouble determination significantly increases the likelihood\nthat the sentence is a reasonable one.\n   Further, the presumption reflects the nature of the\nGuidelines-writing task that Congress set for the Commis-\nsion and the manner in which the Commission carried out\nthat task. In instructing both the sentencing judge and\nthe Commission what to do, Congress referred to the basic\nsentencing objectives that the statute sets forth in 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). That provision\ntells the sentencing judge to consider (1) offense and of-\nfender characteristics; (2) the need for a sentence to reflect\nthe basic aims of sentencing, namely (a) \u201cjust punishment\u201d\n(retribution), (b) deterrence, (c) incapacitation, (d) reha-\nbilitation; (3) the sentences legally available; (4) the Sen-\ntencing Guidelines; (5) Sentencing Commission policy\nstatements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted disparities;\nand (7) the need for restitution. The provision also tells\nthe sentencing judge to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but\nnot greater than necessary, to comply with\u201d the basic aims\nof sentencing as set out above.\n   Congressional statutes then tell the Commission to\nwrite Guidelines that will carry out these same \u00a73553(a)\nobjectives. Thus, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7991(b) indicates that one of\nthe Commission\u2019s basic objectives is to \u201cassure the meeting\nof the purposes of sentencing as set forth in [\u00a73553(a)(2)].\u201d\nThe provision adds that the Commission must seek to\n\u201cprovide certainty and fairness\u201d in sentencing, to \u201cavoi[d]\nunwarranted sentencing disparities,\u201d to \u201cmaintai[n] suffi-\ncient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when\nwarranted by mitigating or aggravating factors not taken\ninto account in the establishment of general sentencing\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7994(f), and 994(m).\n   The upshot is that the sentencing statutes envision both\nthe sentencing judge and the Commission as carrying out\nthe same basic \u00a73553(a) objectives, the one, at retail, the\nother at wholesale.\n   The Commission has made a serious, sometimes contro-\nversial, effort to carry out this mandate. The Commission,\nin describing its Guidelines-writing efforts, refers to these\nsame statutory provisions. It says that it has tried to\nembody in the Guidelines the factors and considerations\nset forth in \u00a73553(a). The Commission\u2019s introductory\nstatement recognizes that Congress \u201cforesees guidelines\nthat will further the basic purposes of criminal punish-\nment, i.e., deterring crime, incapacitating the offender,\nproviding just punishment, and rehabilitating the of-\nfender.\u201d USSG \u00a71A.1, intro to comment., pt. A, \u00b62 (The\nStatutory Mission). It adds that Congress \u201csought uni-\nformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in\nsentences imposed by different federal courts for similar\ncriminal conduct,\u201d as well as \u201cproportionality in sentenc-\ning through a system that imposes appropriately different\nsentences for criminal conduct of different severity.\u201d Ibid.\nThe Basic Approach).\n   The Guidelines commentary explains how, despite\nconsiderable disagreement within the criminal justice\ncommunity, the Commission has gone about writing\nGuidelines that it intends to embody these ends. It says,\nfor example, that the goals of uniformity and proportional-\nity often conflict. The commentary describes the difficul-\nties involved in developing a practical sentencing system\nthat sensibly reconciles the two ends. It adds that a \u201cphi-\n10                RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted\nto reconcile the differing perceptions of the purposes of\ncriminal punishment.\u201d Some would emphasize moral\nculpability and \u201cjust punishment\u201d; others would empha-\nsize the need for \u201ccrime control.\u201d Rather than choose\namong differing practical and philosophical objectives, the\nCommission took an \u201cempirical approach,\u201d beginning with\nan empirical examination of 10,000 presentence reports\nsetting forth what judges had done in the past and then\nmodifying and adjusting past practice in the interests of\ngreater rationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with\ncongressional instructions, and the like. Id., \u00b63, at 3.\n   The Guidelines as written reflect the fact that the Sen-\ntencing Commission examined tens of thousands of sen-\ntences and worked with the help of many others in the law\nenforcement community over a long period of time in an\neffort to fulfill this statutory mandate. They also reflect\nthe fact that different judges (and others) can differ as to\nhow best to reconcile the disparate ends of punishment.\n   The Commission\u2019s work is ongoing. The statutes and\nthe Guidelines themselves foresee continuous evolution\nhelped by the sentencing courts and courts of appeals in\nthat process. The sentencing courts, applying the Guide-\nlines in individual cases may depart (either pursuant to\nthe Guidelines or, since Booker, by imposing a non-\nGuidelines sentence). The judges will set forth their rea-\nsons. The Courts of Appeals will determine the reason-\nableness of the resulting sentence. The Commission will\ncollect and examine the results. In doing so, it may obtain\nadvice from prosecutors, defenders, law enforcement\ngroups, civil liberties associations, experts in penology,\nand others. And it can revise the Guidelines accordingly.\nSee generally 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(p) and note following \u00a7994\n(Commission should review and amend Guidelines as\nnecessary, and Congress has power to revoke or amend\nGuidelines); Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.

Despite JUSTICE SOUTER\u2019s fears to\nthe contrary, post, at 7\u20139 (dissenting opinion), the courts\nof appeals\u2019 \u201creasonableness\u201d presumption, rather than\nhaving independent legal effect, simply recognizes the\nreal-world circumstance that when the judge\u2019s discretion-\nary decision accords with the Commission\u2019s view of the\nappropriate application of \u00a73553(a) in the mine run of\ncases, it is probable that the sentence is reasonable. In-\ndeed, even the Circuits that have declined to adopt a\nformal presumption also recognize that a Guidelines\nsentence will usually be reasonable, because it reflects\nboth the Commission\u2019s and the sentencing court\u2019s judg-\nment as to what is an appropriate sentence for a given\noffender. See Fernandez, 443 F. 2d, at 27; Cooper, 437\nF. 3d, at 331; Talley, 431 F. 3d, at 788.\n   We repeat that the presumption before us is an appel-\nlate court presumption. Given our explanation in Booker\nthat appellate \u201creasonableness\u201d review merely asks\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion, the presump-\ntion applies only on appellate review.

He may hear arguments by prosecution or de-\nfense that the Guidelines sentence should not apply, per-\nhaps because (as the Guidelines themselves foresee) the\ncase at hand falls outside the \u201cheartland\u201d to which the\nCommission intends individual Guidelines to apply, USSG\n\u00a75K2.O, perhaps because the Guidelines sentence itself\nfails properly to reflect \u00a73553(a) considerations, or perhaps\nbecause the case warrants a different sentence regardless.\nSee Rule 32(f). Thus, the sentencing court subjects the\ndefendant\u2019s sentence to the thorough adversarial testing\ncontemplated by federal sentencing procedure. See Rules\n32(f), (h), (i)(C) and (i)(D); see also Burns v. United States,\n501 U. S. 129, 136 (1991) (recognizing importance of notice\nand meaningful opportunity to be heard at sentencing). In\ndetermining the merits of these arguments, the sentencing\ncourt does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption\nthat the Guidelines sentence should apply. Booker, 543\nU. S., at 259\u2013260.\n                             B\n  Rita and his supporting amici make two further argu-\nments against use of the presumption. First, Rita points\nout that many individual Guidelines apply higher sen-\ntences in the presence of special facts, for example, bran-\ndishing a weapon. In many cases, the sentencing judge,\nnot the jury, will determine the existence of those facts. A\npro-Guidelines \u201cpresumption of reasonableness\u201d will in-\ncrease the likelihood that courts of appeals will affirm\nsuch sentences, thereby increasing the likelihood that\nsentencing judges will impose such sentences. For that\nreason, Rita says, the presumption raises Sixth Amend-\nment \u201cconcerns.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 28.\n  In our view, however, the presumption, even if it in-\n                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncreases the likelihood that the judge, not the jury, will find\n\u201csentencing facts,\u201d does not violate the Sixth Amendment.\nThis Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment cases do not automatically\nforbid a sentencing court to take account of factual mat-\nters not determined by a jury and to increase the sentence\nin consequence. Nor do they prohibit the sentencing judge\nfrom taking account of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s fac-\ntual findings or recommended sentences. See Cunning-\nham v. California, 549 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2007) (slip op.,\nat 8\u20139), (citing Booker, supra, at 243\u2013244; Blakely v.\nWashington, 542 U. S. 296, 304\u2013305 (2004); Ring v. Ari-\nzona, 536 U. S. 584, 602 (2002); and Apprendi v. New\nJersey, 530 U. S. 466, 471 (2000)).\n    The Sixth Amendment question, the Court has said, is\nwhether the law forbids a judge to increase a defendant\u2019s\nsentence unless the judge finds facts that the jury did not\nfind (and the offender did not concede). Blakely, supra, at\n303\u2013304 (\u201cWhen a judge inflicts punishment that the\njury\u2019s verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found\nall the facts which the law makes essential to the punish-\nment and the judge exceeds his proper authority\u201d (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)); see Cunningham,\nsupra, at ____, (slip op., 10, 11) (discussing Blakely) (\u201cThe\njudge could not have sentenced Blakely above the stan-\ndard range without finding the additional fact of deliber-\nate cruelty,\u201d \u201c[b]ecause the judge in Blakely\u2019s case could\nnot have imposed a sentence outside the standard range\nwithout finding an additional fact, the top of that range\n. . . was the relevant\u201d maximum sentence for Sixth\nAmendment purposes); Booker, 543 U. S., at 244 (\u201cAny\nfact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to\nsupport a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by\nthe facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict\nmust be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); id., at 232 (discussing\nBlakely) (\u201cWe rejected the State\u2019s argument that the jury\n14                RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nverdict was sufficient to authorize a sentence within the\ngeneral 10-year sentence for class B felonies, noting that\nunder Washington law, the judge was required to find\nadditional facts in order to impose the greater 90-month\nsentence\u201d) (emphasis in original)).\n   A nonbinding appellate presumption that a Guidelines\nsentence is reasonable does not require the sentencing\njudge to impose that sentence. Still less does it forbid the\nsentencing judge from imposing a sentence higher than\nthe Guidelines provide for the jury-determined facts\nstanding alone. As far as the law is concerned, the judge\ncould disregard the Guidelines and apply the same sen-\ntence (higher than the statutory minimum or the bottom\nof the unenhanced Guidelines range) in the absence of the\nspecial facts (say, gun brandishing) which, in the view of\nthe Sentencing Commission, would warrant a higher\nsentence within the statutorily permissible range. Thus,\nour Sixth Amendment cases do not forbid appellate court\nuse of the presumption.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA concedes that the Sixth Amendment\nconcerns he foresees are not presented by this case. Post,\nat 7 (concurring in part and concurring in judgment). And\nhis need to rely on hypotheticals to make his point is con-\nsistent with our view that the approach adopted here will\nnot \u201craise a multitude of constitutional problems.\u201d Clark\nv. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 380\u2013381 (2005). Similarly,\nJUSTICE SCALIA agrees that we have never held that \u201cthe\nSixth Amendment prohibits judges from ever finding any\nfacts\u201d relevant to sentencing. Post, at 6. In sentencing, as\nin other areas, district judges at times make mistakes that\nare substantive. At times, they will impose sentences that\nare unreasonable. Circuit courts exist to correct such\nmistakes when they occur. Our decision in Booker recog-\nnized as much, 543 U. S., at 260\u2013264. Booker held uncon-\nstitutional that portion of the Guidelines that made them\nmandatory. Id., at 233\u2013234, 243\u2013244. It also recognized\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat when district courts impose discretionary sentences,\nwhich are reviewed under normal appellate principles by\ncourts of appeals, such a sentencing scheme will ordinarily\nraise no Sixth Amendment concern. Ibid; see id., at 233\n(opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.) (\u201cIndeed, everyone\nagrees that the constitutional issues presented by these\ncases would have been avoided entirely if Congress had\nomitted from the [federal sentencing statute] the provi-\nsions that make the Guidelines binding on district\njudges\u201d). That being so, our opinion in Booker made clear\nthat today\u2019s holding does not violate the Sixth Amend-\nment.\n   Rita may be correct that the presumption will encourage\nsentencing judges to impose Guidelines sentences. But we\ndo not see how that fact could change the constitutional\ncalculus. Congress sought to diminish unwarranted sen-\ntencing disparity. It sought a Guidelines system that\nwould bring about greater fairness in sentencing through\nincreased uniformity. The fact that the presumption\nmight help achieve these congressional goals does not\nprovide cause for holding the presumption unlawful as\nlong as the presumption remains constitutional. And,\ngiven our case law, we cannot conclude that the presump-\ntion itself violates the Sixth Amendment.\n   The fact that we permit courts of appeals to adopt a\npresumption of reasonableness does not mean that courts\nmay adopt a presumption of unreasonableness. Even the\nGovernment concedes that appellate courts may not pre-\nsume that every variance from the advisory Guidelines is\nunreasonable. See Brief for United States 34\u201335. Several\ncourts of appeals have also rejected a presumption of\nunreasonableness. See, e.g., United States v. Howard, 454\nF. 3d 700, 703 (CA7 2006); United States v. Matheny, 450\nF. 3d 633, 642 (CA6 2006); United States v. Myers, 439\nF. 3d 415, 417 (CA8 2006); United States v. Moreland, 437\nF. 3d 424, 433 (CA4 2006). However, a number of circuits\n16                 RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadhere to the proposition that the strength of the justifica-\ntion needed to sustain an outside-Guidelines sentence\nvaries in proportion to the degree of the variance. See,\ne.g., United States v. Smith, 445 F. 3d 1, 4 (CA1 2006);\nUnited States v. Moreland, 437 F. 3d 424, 434 (CA4 2006);\nUnited States v.

We will consider that approach next Term in\nUnited States v. Gall, No. 06\u20137949.\n   Second, Rita and his amici claim that use of a pro-\nGuidelines presumption on appeal conflicts with Congress\u2019\ninsistence that sentencing judges apply the factors set\nforth in 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (and that\nthe resulting sentence be \u201csufficient, but not greater than\nnecessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d of sentencing set\nforth in that statute). We have explained above, however,\nwhy we believe that, where judge and Commission both\ndetermine that the Guidelines sentences is an appropriate\nsentence for the case at hand, that sentence likely reflects\nthe \u00a73553(a) factors (including its \u201cnot greater than neces-\nsary\u201d requirement). See supra, at 8. This circumstance\nalleviates any serious general conflict between \u00a73553(a)\nand the Guidelines, for the purposes of appellate review.\nAnd, for that reason, we find that nothing in \u00a73553(a)\nrenders use of the presumption unlawful.\n\n                           III\n  We next turn to the question whether the District Court\nproperly analyzed the relevant sentencing factors. In\nparticular, Rita argues that the court took inadequate\naccount of \u00a73553(c) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), a provision that\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequires a sentencing judge, \u201cat the time of sentencing,\u201d to\n\u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the\nparticular sentence.\u201d In our view, given the straightfor-\nward, conceptually simple arguments before the judge, the\njudge\u2019s statement of reasons here, though brief, was le-\ngally sufficient.\n   The statute does call for the judge to \u201cstate\u201d his \u201crea-\nsons.\u201d And that requirement reflects sound judicial prac-\ntice. Judicial decisions are reasoned decisions. Confi-\ndence in a judge\u2019s use of reason underlies the public\u2019s trust\nin the judicial institution. A public statement of those\nreasons helps provide the public with the assurance that\ncreates that trust.\n   That said, we cannot read the statute (or our precedent)\nas insisting upon a full opinion in every case. The appro-\npriateness of brevity or length, conciseness or detail, when\nto write, what to say, depends upon circumstances. Some-\ntimes a judicial opinion responds to every argument;\nsometimes it does not; sometimes a judge simply writes\nthe word \u201cgranted,\u201d or \u201cdenied\u201d on the face of a motion\nwhile relying upon context and the parties\u2019 prior argu-\nments to make the reasons clear. The law leaves much, in\nthis respect, to the judge\u2019s own professional judgment.\n   In the present context, a statement of reasons is impor-\ntant. The sentencing judge should set forth enough to\nsatisfy the appellate court that he has considered the\nparties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising\nhis own legal decisionmaking authority. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Taylor, 487 U. S. 326, 336\u2013337 (1988). Nonethe-\nless, when a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines\nto a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require\nlengthy explanation. Circumstances may well make clear\nthat the judge rests his decision upon the Commission\u2019s\nown reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is a proper\nsentence (in terms of \u00a73353(a) and other congressional\nmandates) in the typical case, and that the judge has\n18                RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfound that the case before him is typical. Unless a party\ncontests the Guidelines sentence generally under\n\u00a73553(a)\u2014that is argues that the Guidelines reflect an\nunsound judgment, or, for example, that they do not gen-\nerally treat certain defendant characteristics in the proper\nway\u2014or argues for departure, the judge normally need say\nno more. Cf. \u00a73553(c)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). (Although,\noften at sentencing a judge will speak at length to a de-\nfendant, and this practice may indeed serve a salutary\npurpose.)\n  Where the defendant or prosecutor presents nonfrivo-\nlous reasons for imposing a different sentence, however,\nthe judge will normally go further and explain why he has\nrejected those arguments. Sometimes the circumstances\nwill call for a brief explanation; sometimes they will call\nfor a lengthier explanation. Where the judge imposes a\nsentence outside the Guidelines, the judge will explain\nwhy he has done so. To our knowledge, an ordinary ex-\nplanation of judicial reasons as to why the judge has, or\nhas not, applied the Guidelines triggers no Sixth Amend-\nment \u201cjury trial\u201d requirement. Cf. Booker, 543 U. S., at\n233 (\u201cFor when a trial judge exercises his discretion to\nselect a specific sentence within a defined range, the de-\nfendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts\nthat the judge deems relevant\u201d) and id., at 242 (require-\nment of finding, not articulation of it, creates Sixth\nAmendment problem).\n  By articulating reasons, even if brief, the sentencing\njudge not only assures reviewing courts (and the public)\nthat the sentencing process is a reasoned process but also\nhelps that process evolve. The sentencing judge has ac-\ncess to, and greater familiarity with, the individual case\nand the individual defendant before him than the Com-\nmission or the appeals court. That being so, his reasoned\nsentencing judgment, resting upon an effort to filter the\nGuidelines\u2019 general advice through \u00a73553(a)\u2019s list of fac-\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntors, can provide relevant information to both the court of\nappeals and ultimately the Sentencing Commission. The\nreasoned responses of these latter institutions to the\nsentencing judge\u2019s explanation should help the Guidelines\nconstructively evolve over time, as both Congress and the\nCommission foresaw. See generally supra, at 11.\n   In the present case the sentencing judge\u2019s statement of\nreasons was brief but legally sufficient. Rita argued for a\ndownward departure from the 33-to-41 month Guidelines\nsentence on the basis of three sets of special circum-\nstances: health, fear of retaliation in prison, and military\nrecord. See App. 40\u201347. He added that, in any event,\nthese same circumstances warrant leniency beyond that\ncontemplated by the Guidelines.\n   The record makes clear that the sentencing judge lis-\ntened to each argument. The judge considered the sup-\nporting evidence. The judge was fully aware of defen-\ndant\u2019s various physical ailments and imposed a sentence\nthat takes them into account. The judge understood that\nRita had previously worked in the immigration service\nwhere he had been involved in detecting criminal offenses.\nAnd he considered Rita\u2019s lengthy military service, includ-\ning over 25 years of service, both on active duty and in the\nReserve, and Rita\u2019s receipt of 35 medals, awards, and\nnominations.\n   The judge then simply found these circumstances insuf-\nficient to warrant a sentence lower than the Guidelines\nrange of 33 to 45 months. Id., at 87. He said that this\nrange was not \u201cinappropriate.\u201d (This, of course, is not the\nlegal standard for imposition of sentence, but taken in\ncontext it is plain that the judge so understood.) He im-\nmediately added that he found that the 33-month sentence\nat the bottom of the Guidelines range was \u201cappropriate.\u201d\nIbid. He must have believed that there was not much\nmore to say.\n   We acknowledge that the judge might have said more.\n20                 RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHe might have added explicitly that he had heard and\nconsidered the evidence and argument; that (as no one\nbefore him denied) he thought the Commission in the\nGuidelines had determined a sentence that was proper in\nthe minerun of roughly similar perjury cases; and that he\nfound that Rita\u2019s personal circumstances here were simply\nnot different enough to warrant a different sentence. But\ncontext and the record make clear that this, or similar,\nreasoning, underlies the judge\u2019s conclusion. Where a\nmatter is as conceptually simple as in the case at hand\nand the record makes clear that the sentencing judge\nconsidered the evidence and arguments, we do not believe\nthe law requires the judge to write more extensively.\n                              IV\n   We turn to the final question: Was the Court of Appeals,\nafter applying its presumption, legally correct in holding\nthat Rita\u2019s sentence (a sentence that applied, and did not\ndepart from, the relevant sentencing Guideline) was not\n\u201cunreasonable\u201d? In our view, the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclu-\nsion was lawful.\n   As we previously said, see Part I, supra, the crimes at\nissue are perjury and obstruction of justice. In essence\nthose offenses involved the making of knowingly false,\nmaterial statements under oath before a grand jury,\nthereby impeding its criminal investigation. The Guide-\nlines provide for a typical such offense a base offense level\nof 20, 6 levels below the level provided for a simple viola-\ntion of the crime being investigated (here the unlawful\nimportation of machineguns). The offender, Rita, has no\ncountable prior offenses and consequently falls within\ncriminal history category I.

His sentence\nexplicitly takes health into account by seeking assurance\nthat the Bureau of Prisons will provide appropriate treat-\nment. The record makes out no special fear of retaliation,\nasserting only that the threat is one that any former law\nenforcement official might suffer. Similarly, though Rita\nhas a lengthy and distinguished military record, he did not\nclaim at sentencing that military service should ordinarily\nlead to a sentence more lenient than the sentence the\nGuidelines impose. Like the District Court and the Court\nof Appeals, we simply cannot say that Rita\u2019s special cir-\ncumstances are special enough that, in light of \u00a73553(a),\nthey require a sentence lower than the sentence the\nGuidelines provide.\n   Finally, Rita and supporting amici here claim that the\nGuidelines sentence is not reasonable under \u00a73553(a)\nbecause it expressly declines to consider various personal\ncharacteristics of the defendant, such as physical condi-\ntion, employment record, and military service, under the\nview that these factors are \u201cnot ordinarily relevant.\u201d\nUSSG \u00a7\u00a75H1.4, 5H1.5, 5H1.11.

Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), was not\nunanimous. See id., at 272 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). But\nBooker is now settled law and must be accepted as such.\nSee B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149\n(1921) (\u201c[T]he labor of judges would be increased almost to\nthe breaking point if every past decision could be reopened\nin every case, and one could not lay one\u2019s own course of\nbricks on the secure foundation of the courses laid by\nothers who had gone before him\u201d). Therefore, our task\ntoday is to apply Booker\u2019s \u201creasonableness\u201d standard to a\nDistrict Judge\u2019s decision to impose a sentence within the\nrange recommended by United States Sentencing Guide-\nlines that are now advisory, rather than binding.\n                             I\n  Simply stated, Booker replaced the de novo standard of\nreview required by 18 U. S. C. \u00a73742(e) with an abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard that we called \u201c \u2018reasonableness\u2019 \u201d\nreview. 543 U. S., at 262. We noted in Booker that the de\nnovo standard was a recent addition to the law. Prior to\n2003, appellate courts reviewed sentencing departures for\nabuse of discretion under our decision in Koon v. United\nStates, 518 U. S. 81 (1996). In 2003, however, Congress\n2                      RITA v.

See Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to\nend the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003,\n\u00a7401(d)(1), 117 Stat. 670. Recognizing that \u201cthe reasons\nfor th[is] revisio[n]\u2014to make Guidelines sentencing even\nmore mandatory than it had been\u2014 . . . ceased to be rele-\nvant\u201d in light of the Court\u2019s constitutional holding,1 Booker\nexcised the portion of \u00a73742(e) that directed courts of\nappeals to apply the de novo standard. 543 U. S., at 261.\nCritically, we did not touch the portions of \u00a73742(e) requir-\ning appellate courts to \u201cgive due regard to the opportunity\nof the district court to judge the credibility of the wit-\nnesses,\u201d to \u201caccept the findings of fact of the district court\nunless they are clearly erroneous,\u201d and to \u201cgive due defer-\nence to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to\nthe facts.\u201d By leaving those portions of the statute intact\nwhile severing the portion mandating a de novo standard\nof review, Booker restored the abuse-of-discretion stan-\ndard identified in three earlier cases: Pierce v. Underwood,\n487 U. S. 552, 558\u2013560 (1988), Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx\nCorp., 496 U. S. 384, 403\u2013405 (1990), and Koon. See\nBooker, 543 U.

(\u201cWe\n\nhave never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion\nin imposing a sentence within a statutory range. Indeed, everyone\nagrees that the constitutional issues presented by these cases would\nhave been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the [Sentenc-\ning Reform Act of 1984] the provisions that make the Guidelines\nbinding on district judges\u201d (citations omitted)).\n  2 In fact, Booker expressly equated the new \u201creasonableness\u201d stan-\n\ndard with the old abuse-of-discretion standard used to review sentenc-\ning departures. See id., at 262 (\u201c \u2018Reasonableness\u2019 standards are not\nforeign to sentencing law. The Act has long required their use in\nimportant sentencing circumstances\u2014both on review of departures, see\n18 U. S. C. \u00a73742(e)(3) (1994 ed.), and on review of sentences imposed\nwhere there was no applicable Guideline, see \u00a7\u00a73742(a)(4), (b)(4), (e)(4)\u201d\n(emphasis added)).\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

S. C. \u00a72412(d). Because the Act\ndid not specify a standard of review, we found it necessary\nto rely on several \u201csignificant relevant factors\u201d that per-\nsuaded us to apply an \u201c \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d standard.\n487 U. S., at 559. One factor was that a district judge was\n\u201c \u2018better positioned\u2019 \u201d than an appellate judge to decide the\nissue. Id., at 560 (quoting Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104,\n114 (1985)). We noted that a district court, through its\nparticipation in \u201csettlement conferences and other pretrial\nactivities,\u201d \u201cmay have insights not conveyed by the record,\ninto such matters as whether particular evidence was\nworthy of being relied upon.\u201d 487 U. S., at 560. We like-\nwise noted that \u201ceven where the district judge\u2019s full\nknowledge of the factual setting can be acquired by the\nappellate court, that acquisition will often come at un-\nusual expense.\u201d Ibid. A second factor that we found sig-\nnificant was the impracticability of formulating a rule of\ndecision for an issue that may involve \u201c \u2018multifarious,\nfleeting, special, narrow facts that utterly resist generali-\nzation.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 561\u2013562. In Cooter & Gell, we held that\nboth of these factors supported an \u201cabuse-of-discretion\u201d\nstandard for review of a district judge\u2019s imposition of\nsanctions for violations of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure. See 496 U. S., at 403\u2013405. A third factor,\nthe District Court\u2019s special knowledge about \u201cthe local\nbar\u2019s litigation practices,\u201d also supported the abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard. Id., at 404. We further noted that\n\u201c[d]eference to the determination of courts on the front\nlines of litigation will enhance these courts\u2019 ability to\ncontrol the litigants before them.\u201d Ibid.\n    Recognizing that these factors bear equally upon a trial\njudge\u2019s sentencing decision, Koon expressly applied the\n4                  RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., concurring\n\nprinciples of Pierce and Cooter & Gell to the sentencing\ncontext. See Koon, 518 U. S., at 99. We adopted the same\nabuse-of-discretion standard, unanimously holding that a\ndistrict court\u2019s decision to depart from the Guidelines \u201cwill\nin most cases be due substantial deference, for it embodies\nthe traditional exercise of discretion by a sentencing\ncourt.\u201d Id, at 98. Echoing our earlier opinions, we added\nthat \u201c[d]istrict courts have an institutional advantage over\nappellate courts\u201d because they \u201cmust make a refined\nassessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome,\ninformed by its vantage point and day-to-day experience in\ncriminal sentencing.\u201d Ibid. We also relied on the follow-\ning statement in our opinion in Williams v. United States,\n503 U. S. 193 (1992):\n    \u201cThe development of the guideline sentencing regime\n    has not changed our view that, except to the extent\n    specifically directed by statute, \u2018it is not the role of an\n    appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of\n    the sentencing court as to the appropriateness of a\n    particular sentence.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 205 (quoting Solem v.\n    Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 290, n. 16 (1983)).\n   These basic considerations about the nature of sentenc-\ning have not changed in a post-Booker world. While the\nspecific holding in Koon concerned only the scope of the\ntrial judge\u2019s discretion on whether to depart from the\nGuidelines, now that the Guidelines are no longer manda-\ntory, our reasoning applies with equal force to the sentenc-\ning judge\u2019s decision \u201c \u2018as to the appropriateness of a par-\nticular sentence.\u2019 \u201d Williams, 503 U. S., at 205. After\nBooker, appellate courts are now to assess a district court\u2019s\nexercise of discretion \u201cwith regard to \u00a73553(a).\u201d 543 U. S.,\nat 261. As we explained, \u201cSection 3553(a) remains in\neffect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentenc-\ning. Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as\nthey have in the past, in determining whether a sentence\n                     Cite as: 551 U.

While reviewing courts may presume\nthat a sentence within the advisory Guidelines is reason-\nable, appellate judges must still always defer to the sen-\ntencing judge\u2019s individualized sentencing determination.\nAs we stated in Koon, \u201c[i]t has been uniform and constant\nin the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to\nconsider every convicted person as an individual and every\ncase as a unique study in the human failings that some-\ntimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the\npunishment to ensue.\u201d 518 U. S., at 113. The Commission\nhas not developed any standards or recommendations that\naffect sentencing ranges for many individual characteris-\ntics. Matters such as age, education, mental or emotional\ncondition, medical condition (including drug or alcohol\naddiction), employment history, lack of guidance as a\nyouth, family ties, or military, civic, charitable, or public\nservice are not ordinarily considered under the Guidelines.\nSee United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines\nManual \u00a7\u00a75H1.1\u20136, 11, and 12 (Nov. 2006).3 These are,\nhowever, matters that \u00a73553(a) authorizes the sentencing\njudge to consider. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(1). As\nsuch, they are factors that an appellate court must con-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See   also Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Key\nCompromises Upon Which They Rest, 17 Hofstra L. Rev. 1, 19\u201320\n(1988) (\u201cThe Commission extensively debated which offender character-\nistics should make a difference in sentencing; that is, which character-\nistics were important enough to warrant formal reflection within the\nGuidelines and which should constitute possible grounds for depar-\nture. . . . Eventually, in light of the arguments based in part on consid-\nerations of fairness and in part on the uncertainty as to how a sentenc-\ning judge would actually account for the aggravating and/or mitigating\nfactors . . . the current offender characteristics rules look primarily to\npast records of convictions\u201d (footnotes omitted)).\n6                 RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., concurring\n\nsider under Booker\u2019s abuse-of-discretion standard.\n   My disagreement with JUSTICE SCALIA and JUSTICE\nSOUTER rests on the above understanding of Booker\u2019s\nstandard of appellate review. I do not join JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s opinion because I believe that the purely proce-\ndural review he advocates is inconsistent with our reme-\ndial opinion in Booker, which plainly contemplated that\nreasonableness review would contain a substantive com-\nponent. See 543 U. S., at 260\u2013264. After all, a district\njudge who gives harsh sentences to Yankees fans and\nlenient sentences to Red Sox fans would not be acting\nreasonably even if her procedural rulings were impeccable.\nMoreover, even if some future unusually harsh sentence\nmight violate the Sixth Amendment because it exceeds\nsome yet-to-be-defined judicial standard of reasonable-\nness, JUSTICE SCALIA correctly acknowledges this case\ndoes not present such a problem. See post, at 7 (opinion\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201cNor is\nmy claim that the Sixth Amendment was violated in this\ncase, for petitioner cannot demonstrate that his relatively\nlow sentence would have been unreasonable if the District\nCourt had relied on nothing but jury-found or admitted\nfacts\u201d); see also ante, at 14 (\u201cJUSTICE SCALIA concedes that\nthe Sixth Amendment concerns he foresees are not pre-\nsented by this case. Post, at 7 (concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). And his need to rely on hy-\npotheticals to make his point is consistent with our view\nthat the approach adopted here will not \u2018raise a multitude\nof constitutional problems.\u2019 Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S.\n371, 380\u2013381 (2005)\u201d). Such a hypothetical case should be\ndecided if and when it arises. See, e.g., Valley Forge\nChristian College v. Americans United for Separation of\nChurch and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 472 (1982).\n   As to JUSTICE SOUTER\u2019s opinion, I think he overesti-\nmates the \u201cgravitational pull\u201d towards the advisory Guide-\nlines that will result from a presumption of reasonable-\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

Booker\u2019s standard of\nreview allows\u2014indeed, requires\u2014district judges to con-\nsider all of the factors listed in \u00a73553(a) and to apply them\nto the individual defendants before them. Appellate\ncourts must then give deference to the sentencing deci-\nsions made by those judges, whether the resulting sen-\ntence is inside or outside the advisory Guidelines range,\nunder traditional abuse-of-discretion principles. As the\nCourt acknowledges, moreover, presumptively reasonable\ndoes not mean always reasonable; the presumption, of\ncourse, must be genuinely rebuttable. See ante, at 7. I am\nnot blind to the fact that, as a practical matter, many\nfederal judges continued to treat the Guidelines as virtu-\nally mandatory after our decision in Booker. See post, at\n7, n. 3 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). One well-respected federal judge has even\nwritten that, \u201cafter watching this Court\u2014and the other\nCourts of Appeals, whether they have formally adopted\nsuch a presumption or not\u2014affirm hundreds upon hun-\ndreds of within-Guidelines sentences, it seems to me that\nthe rebuttability of the presumption is more theoretical\nthan real.\u201d United States v. Pruitt, No. 06\u20133152, 2007\nU. S. App. LEXIS 12872, *35\u2013*36 (CA10, June 4, 2007)\n(McConnell, J., concurring). Our decision today makes\nclear, however, that the rebuttability of the presumption is\nreal. It should also be clear that appellate courts must\nreview sentences individually and deferentially whether\nthey are inside the Guidelines range (and thus potentially\nsubject to a formal \u201cpresumption\u201d of reasonableness) or\noutside that range. Given the clarity of our holding, I trust\nthat those judges who had treated the Guidelines as virtu-\nally mandatory during the post-Booker interregnum will\nnow recognize that the Guidelines are truly advisory.\n  Applying this standard, I would affirm the sentence\nimposed by the District Court. Although I would have\nimposed a lower sentence had I been the District Judge, I\n8                 RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., concurring\n\nagree that he did not abuse his discretion in making the\nparticular decision that he did. I also agree with the\nCourt that his decision is entitled to added respect because\nit was consistent with the advice in the Guidelines.\n                               II\n   That said, I do believe that there was a significant flaw\nin the sentencing procedure in this case. The petitioner is\na veteran who received significant recognition for his\nservice to his country. That aspect of his background is\nnot taken into consideration in the sentencing guidelines\nand was not mentioned by the District Judge in his expla-\nnation of his choice of the sentence that defendant re-\nceived. I regard this as a serious omission because I think\nthe judge\u2019s statement to the defendant, made at the time\nof sentencing, is an especially important part of the crimi-\nnal process. If the defendant is convinced that justice has\nbeen done in his case\u2014that society has dealt with him\nfairly\u2014the likelihood of his successful rehabilitation will\nsurely be enhanced. Nevertheless, given the importance of\npaying appropriate respect to the exercise of a sentencing\njudge\u2019s discretion, I join the Court\u2019s opinion and judgment.\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

RITA, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n                        [June 21, 2007]\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n  In United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), five\nJustices of this Court, I among them, held that our previ-\nous decision in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296\n(2004), applied to sentences imposed under the Federal\nSentencing Guidelines because those Guidelines were\nmandatory and binding on judges. See 543 U. S., at 233\u2013\n234, 243\u2013244. We thus reaffirmed that \u201c[a]ny fact (other\nthan a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a\nsentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts\nestablished by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be\nadmitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at 244. In response to this consti-\ntutional holding, a different majority of five Justices held\nthat the appropriate remedy was to make the Guidelines\nnonmandatory in all cases and to review sentences on\nappeal only for reasonableness. See id., at 258\u2013265. I\ndisagreed with the Court\u2019s remedial choice, believing\ninstead that the proper remedy was to maintain the man-\ndatory character of the Guidelines and simply to require,\nfor that small category of cases in which a fact was legally\nessential to the sentence imposed, that the fact be proved\nto a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the\ndefendant. See id., at 272\u2013291 (STEVENS, J., joined by\nSCALIA and SOUTER, JJ., dissenting in part).\n2                 RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   I do not mean to reopen that debate. As a matter of\nstatutory stare decisis, I accept Booker\u2019s remedial holding\nthat district courts are no longer bound by the Guidelines\nand that appellate courts should review the sentences\nimposed for reasonableness. As should be clear from our\nneed to decide the case today, however, precisely what\n\u201creasonableness\u201d review entails is not dictated by Booker.\nAs I lamented then, \u201c[t]he worst feature of the scheme is\nthat no one knows\u2014and perhaps no one is meant to\nknow\u2014how advisory Guidelines and \u2018unreasonableness\u2019\nreview will function in practice.\u201d Id., at 311 (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting in part).\n   Earlier this Term, the Court intensified its silence when\nit declined to flesh out what it had in mind in the face of\nan argument that the form of reasonableness review had\nconstitutional implications. In Cunningham v. California,\n549 U. S. ___ (2007), JUSTICE ALITO defended the constitu-\ntionality of California\u2019s sentencing system in part by\narguing that, even post-Booker, some federal sentences\nwill be upheld as reasonable only if the judge makes addi-\ntional findings of fact beyond those encompassed by the\njury verdict or guilty plea. 549 U. S., at ___, and n. 11\n(slip op., at 13, and n. 11) (dissenting opinion). The Cun-\nningham majority\u2019s response, much like the Booker reme-\ndial opinion, was cryptic. While the Court did not explain\nwhy JUSTICE ALITO was incorrect, it strongly intimated\nthat his premise was wrong: that he had erroneously\n\u201canticipate[d]\u201d how \u201creasonableness review operates in\npractice.\u201d Cunningham, 549 U. S., at ___, n. 15 (slip op.,\nat 20, n. 15). Because that question is squarely presented\nin this case that was then pending, the Court found it\n\u201cneither necessary nor proper . . . to join issue with\nJUSTICE ALITO on this matter,\u201d suggesting that all would\nbe revealed in the opinion we issue today. See id., at ___,\nn. 13 (slip op., at 15, n. 13).\n   Today has arrived, and the Court has broken its prom-\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

Nothing in the Court\u2019s opinion explains why, under\nthe advisory Guidelines scheme, judge-found facts are\nnever legally necessary to justify the sentence. By this I\nmean the Court has failed to establish that every sentence\nwhich will be imposed under the advisory Guidelines\nscheme could equally have been imposed had the judge\nrelied upon no facts other than those found by the jury or\nadmitted by the defendant. In fact, the Court implicitly,\nbut quite plainly, acknowledges that this will not be the\ncase, by treating as a permissible post-Booker claim peti-\ntioner\u2019s challenge of his within-Guidelines sentence as\nsubstantively excessive. See ante, at Part IV. Under the\nscheme promulgated today, some sentences reversed as\nexcessive will be legally authorized in later cases only\nbecause additional judge-found facts are present; and, as\nJUSTICE ALITO argued in Cunningham, some lengthy\nsentences will be affirmed (i.e., held lawful) only because\nof the presence of aggravating facts, not found by the jury,\nthat distinguish the case from the mine-run. The Court\ndoes not even attempt to explain how this is consistent\nwith the Sixth Amendment.\n   No explanation is given because no explanation is possi-\nble. The Court has reintroduced the constitutional defect\nthat Booker purported to eliminate. I cannot acquiesce in\nthis course. If a sentencing system is permissible in which\nsome sentences cannot lawfully be imposed by a judge\nunless the judge finds certain facts by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, then we should have left in place the com-\npulsory Guidelines that Congress enacted, instead of\nimposing this jerry-rigged scheme of our own. In order to\navoid the possibility of a Sixth Amendment violation,\nwhich was the object of the Booker remedy, district courts\nmust be able, without finding any facts not embraced in\nthe jury verdict or guilty plea, to sentence to the maximum\nof the statutory range. Because, therefore, appellate\ncourts cannot reverse within-range sentences for being too\n4                  RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nhigh; and because no one would contend that Congress\nintended that sentences be reviewed only for being too low;\nI would hold that reasonableness review cannot contain a\nsubstantive component at all. I believe, however, that\nappellate courts can nevertheless secure some amount of\nsentencing uniformity through the procedural reasonable-\nness review made possible by the Booker remedial opinion.\n                                I\n                               A\n  The Sixth Amendment requires that \u201c[a]ny fact (other\nthan a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a\nsentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts\nestablished by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be\nadmitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\u201d Booker, 543 U. S., at 244. Two hy-\npotheticals will suffice to reveal why the notion of excessive\nsentences within the statutory range, and the ability of\nappellate courts to reverse such sentences, inexorably\nproduces, in violation of the Sixth Amendment, sentences\nwhose legality is premised on a judge\u2019s finding some fact (or\ncombination of facts) by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  First, consider two brothers with similar backgrounds\nand criminal histories who are convicted by a jury of re-\nspectively robbing two banks of an equal amount of\nmoney. Next assume that the district judge finds that one\nbrother, fueled by racial animus, had targeted the first\nbank because it was owned and operated by minorities,\nwhereas the other brother had selected the second bank\nsimply because its location enabled a quick getaway.\nFurther assume that the district judge imposes the statu-\ntory maximum upon both brothers, basing those sentences\nprimarily upon his perception that bank robbery should be\npunished much more severely than the Guidelines base\nlevel advises, but explicitly noting that the racially biased\ndecisionmaking of the first brother further justified his\n                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nsentence. Now imagine that the appellate court reverses\nas excessive only the sentence of the nonracist brother.\nGiven the dual holdings of the appellate court, the racist\nhas a valid Sixth Amendment claim that his sentence was\nreasonable (and hence lawful) only because of the judicial\nfinding of his motive in selecting his victim.1\n   Second, consider the common case in which the district\ncourt imposes a sentence within an advisory Guidelines\nrange that has been substantially enhanced by certain\njudge-found facts. For example, the base offense level for\nrobbery under the Guidelines is 20, United States Sen-\ntencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a72B3.1(a) (Nov.\n2006), which, if the defendant has a criminal history of I,\ncorresponds to an advisory range of 33\u201341 months, id.,\nch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. If, however, a judge finds\nthat a firearm was discharged, that a victim incurred\nserious bodily injury, and that more than $5 million was\nstolen, then the base level jumps by 18, \u00a7\u00a72B3.1(b)(2), (3),\n(7), producing an advisory range of 235\u2013293 months, id.,\nch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. When a judge finds all of\nthose facts to be true and then imposes a within-\nGuidelines sentence of 293 months, those judge-found\nfacts, or some combination of them, are not merely facts\nthat the judge finds relevant in exercising his discretion;\nthey are the legally essential predicate for his imposition\nof the 293-month sentence. His failure to find them would\nrender the 293-month sentence unlawful. That is evident\nbecause, were the district judge explicitly to find none of\nthose facts true and nevertheless to impose a 293-month\nsentence (simply because he thinks robbery merits seven\ntimes the sentence that the Guidelines provide) the sen-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Of course, it may be that some fact other than racial animus would\nalso have sufficed to sustain the increased sentence. But it is undeni-\nable that in the case at hand the judicial finding of racial animus filled\nthat role. See Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 305 (2004).\n6                         RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                             Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ntence would surely be reversed as unreasonably excessive.\n   These hypotheticals are stylized ways of illustrating the\nbasic problem with a system in which district courts lack\nfull discretion to sentence within the statutory range.\nUnder such a system, for every given crime there is some\nmaximum sentence that will be upheld as reasonable\nbased only on the facts found by the jury or admitted by\nthe defendant. Every sentence higher than that is legally\nauthorized only by some judge-found fact, in violation of\nthe Sixth Amendment. Appellate courts\u2019 excessiveness\nreview will explicitly or implicitly accept those judge-found\nfacts as justifying sentences that would otherwise be\nunlawful. The only difference between this system and\nthe pre-Booker mandatory Guidelines is that the maxi-\nmum sentence based on the jury verdict or guilty plea was\nspecified under the latter but must be established by\nappellate courts, in case-by-case fashion, under the for-\nmer. This is, if anything, an additional constitutional\ndisease, not a constitutional cure.\n   To be clear, I am not suggesting that the Sixth Amend-\nment prohibits judges from ever finding any facts. We\nhave repeatedly affirmed the proposition that judges can\nfind facts that help guide their discretion within the sen-\ntencing range that is authorized by the facts found by the\njury or admitted by the defendant. See, e.g., Booker, su-\npra, at 233; Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 481\n(2000). But there is a fundamental difference, one under-\npinning our entire Apprendi jurisprudence, between facts\nthat must be found in order for a sentence to be lawful,\nand facts that individual judges choose to make relevant to\nthe exercise of their discretion. The former, but not the\nlatter, must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable\ndoubt in order \u201cto give intelligible content to the right of\njury trial.\u201d Blakely, 542 U. S., at 305.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 For   similar reasons, I recognize that the Sixth Amendment problem\n                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                    7\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   I am also not contending that there is a Sixth Amend-\nment problem with the Court\u2019s affirmation of a presump-\ntion of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentences. I\nagree with the Court that such a presumption never itself\nmakes judge-found facts legally essential to the sentence\nimposed, since it has no direct relevance to whether the\nsentence would have been unreasonable in the absence of\nany judge-found facts. See ante, at 12\u201315.3 Nor is my\nclaim that the Sixth Amendment was violated in this case,\nfor petitioner cannot demonstrate that his relatively low\nsentence would have been unreasonable if the District\nCourt had relied on nothing but jury-found or admitted\nfacts.\n   Rather, my position is that there will inevitably be some\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwith reasonableness review is created only by the lack of district court\ndiscretion to impose high sentences, since eliminating discretion to\nimpose low sentences is the equivalent of judicially creating mandatory\nminimums, which are not a concern of the Sixth Amendment. See\nHarris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 568\u2013569 (2002). But since\nreasonableness review should not function as a one-way ratchet, United\nStates v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 257\u2013258, 266 (2005), we must forswear\nthe notion that sentences can be too low in light of the need to abandon\nthe concept that sentences can be too high.\n  3 For this reason, I do not join JUSTICE SOUTER\u2019s dissent. He wishes to\n\ngive \u201cdistrict courts [assurance] that the entire sentencing range set by\nstatute is available to them.\u201d Post, at 8. That is a proper goal\u2014indeed,\nan essential one to prevent the Booker remedy from effectively over-\nturning Apprendi and Blakely. But eliminating the presumption of\nreasonableness will not achieve it. In those Circuits that already\ndecline to employ the presumption, a within-Guidelines sentence has\nnever been reversed as substantively excessive, Brief for New York\nCouncil of Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 5, refuting the belief that\nmere elimination of the presumption will destroy the \u201cgravitational\npull,\u201d post, at 7 (SOUTER, J., dissenting), to stay safely within the\nGuidelines. The only way to assure district courts that they can devi-\nate from the advisory Guidelines, and to ensure that judge-found facts\nare never legally essential to the sentence, is to prohibit appellate\ncourts from reviewing the substantive sentencing choices made by\ndistrict courts.\n8                 RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nconstitutional violations under a system of substantive\nreasonableness review, because there will be some sen-\ntences that will be upheld as reasonable only because of\nthe existence of judge-found facts. Booker itself reveals\nwhy that reality dooms the construct of reasonableness\nreview established and applied by today\u2019s opinion. Booker\nmade two things quite plain. First, reasonableness is the\nstandard of review implicitly contained within the Sen-\ntencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA). 543 U. S., at 260\u2013261.\nSecond, Congress wanted a uniform system of sentencing\nreview, rather than different schemes depending on\nwhether there were Sixth Amendment problems in par-\nticular cases. Id., at 265\u2013267. Thus, if the contours of\nreasonableness review must be narrowed in some cases\nbecause of constitutional concerns, then they must be\nnarrowed in all cases in light of Congress\u2019s desire for a\nuniform standard of review. The Justices composing\ntoday\u2019s Court were in total agreement with this principle\nof statutory interpretation the day Booker was decided:\n    \u201c[W]hen deciding which of two plausible statutory con-\n    structions to adopt, a court must consider the neces-\n    sary consequences of its choice. If one of them would\n    raise a multitude of constitutional problems, the other\n    should prevail\u2014whether or not those constitutional\n    problems pertain to the particular litigant before the\n    Court.\u201d Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 380\u2013381\n    (2005) (opinion for the Court by SCALIA, J., joined by,\n    inter alios, STEVENS, KENNEDY, GINSBURG, and\n    BREYER, JJ.).\nYet they now adopt substantive reasonableness review\nwithout offering any rebuttal to my charge of patent con-\nstitutional flaw inherent in such review. The one comfort\nto be found in the Court\u2019s opinion\u2014though it does not\nexcuse the failure to apply Martinez\u2019s interpretive princi-\nple\u2014is that it does not rule out as-applied Sixth Amend-\n                     Cite as: 551 U.

Ante, at 14\u201315; ante, at 6 (STEVENS,\nJ., joined by GINSBURG, J., concurring).4\n                           B\n  Had the Court bothered to frame objections to the con-\nstitutional analysis undertaken above, there are four\nconceivable candidates.\n                            1\n  The most simplistic objection is that the Sixth Amend-\nment is not violated because the judge-found facts are\nmade legally necessary by the decision of appellate courts\nrather than the decision of Congress. This rebuttal errs\nboth in premise and in conclusion.\n  The premise is wrong because, according to the remedial\nmajority in Booker, the facts that excessiveness review\nrenders legally essential are made such by Congress.\nReasonableness is the standard of review implicitly con-\ntained within 18 U. S. C. \u00a73742 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV).\nSee Booker, supra, at 260\u2013261. But the Sixth Amendment\nwould be violated even if appellate courts really were\nexercising some type of common-law power to prescribe\nthe facts legally necessary to support specific sentences.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The Court suggests that my reliance on hypotheticals indicates that\n\nits interpretation of reasonableness will not create a multitude of\nconstitutional problems. Ante, at 14; see also ante, at 6 (STEVENS, J.,\nconcurring). Setting aside the question whether the volume of constitu-\ntional violations has any relevance to the application of Martinez\u2019s\ninterpretive principle, the Court is wrong to think that the constitu-\ntional problem today\u2019s opinion ignores is hypothetical, merely because I\nhave used hypotheticals to describe it. It is all too real that advisory\nGuidelines sentences routinely change months and years of imprison-\nment to decades and centuries on the basis of judge-found facts\u2014as\nBooker itself recognized, see 543 U. S., at 236\u2013237 (citing, inter alia, a\ncase in which a defendant\u2019s sentence increased from 57 months to 155\nyears).\n10                 RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nNeither Apprendi nor any of its progeny suggests that\nviolation of the Sixth Amendment depends upon what\nbranch of government has made the prescription. To the\ncontrary, Booker flatly rejected the argument that the\nmandatory Guidelines were constitutional because it was\nthe Sentencing Commission rather than Congress that\nspecified the facts essential to punishment. See 543 U. S.,\nat 237\u2013239. And for good reason. The Sixth Amendment\nis \u201ca reservation of jury power.\u201d Blakely, 542 U. S., at 308.\nIt makes no difference whether it is a legislature, a Sen-\ntencing Commission, or an appellate court that usurps the\njury\u2019s prerogative. Were it otherwise, this Court could\nprescribe that the only reasonable sentences are those\nconsistent with the same mandatory Guidelines that\nBooker invalidated. And the California Supreme Court\ncould effectively reverse our decision in Cunningham\nsimply by setting aside as unreasonable any trial-court\nsentence that does not conform to pre-Cunningham Cali-\nfornia law.\n                             2\n   The next objection minimizes the extent to which exces-\nsiveness review makes judge-found facts legally essential\nto punishment. If appellate courts will uphold, based only\non the facts found by the jury, a district court\u2019s decision to\nimpose all but the lengthiest sentences, then the number\nof sentences that are legally dependent on judge-found\nfacts will be quite small. Thus, the argument goes, there\nis no reason to prohibit substantive reasonableness review\naltogether: Absent a claim that such review creates a\nconstitutional problem in a given case, why prohibit it? I\nhave already explained why this line of defense is incon-\nsistent with established principles of statutory interpreta-\ntion. See supra, at 7\u20139. But even on its own terms, the\ndefense is inconsistent with Booker because reasonable-\nness review is an improper and inadequate remedial\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)          11\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nscheme unless it ensures that judge-found facts are never\nlegally necessary to justify the sentence imposed under the\nadvisory Guidelines.\n   The mandatory Guidelines system that was invalidated\nin Booker had the same attribute of producing unconstitu-\ntional results in only a small proportion of cases. Because\nof guilty pleas and Guidelines ranges that did not depend\non judge-found facts, the overwhelming majority of sen-\ntences imposed under the pre-Booker federal system were\nperfectly in accord with the Sixth Amendment. See\nBooker, 543 U. S., at 248; id., at 275\u2013277 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting in part). Booker nevertheless excised key\nstatutory provisions governing federal sentencing, in order\nto eliminate constitutional violations entirely. If our con-\njured-up system does not accomplish that goal, then by\nwhat right have we supplanted the congressionally en-\nacted mandatory Guidelines?\n   If it is true that some sentences under today\u2019s Court-\nprescribed system will still violate the Sixth Amendment,\nnonetheless allowing the system to go forward will pro-\nduce chaos. Most cases do not resemble my stylized hy-\npotheticals, and ordinarily defendants and judges will be\nunable to figure out, based on a comparison of the facts in\ntheir case with the facts of all of the previously decided\nappellate cases, whether the sentence imposed would have\nbeen upheld as reasonable based only on the facts support-\ning the jury verdict or guilty plea. That will not stop\ndefendants from making the argument, however, and the\nCourt certainly has not foreclosed them from trying. See\nsupra, at 8\u20139, and n. 4. Judges will have in theory two\noptions: create complicated charts and databases, based on\nappellate precedents, to ascertain what facts are legally\nessential to justify what sentences; or turn a deaf ear to\nthese claims, though knowing full well that some of them\n12                    RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nare justified. I bet on the latter.5 Things were better\nunder the mandatory Guidelines system, where every\njudge could readily identify when the Sixth Amendment\nwas being violated, and could rule accordingly.\n                               3\n   Proponents of substantive reasonableness review could\nnext argue that actual sentencing involves the considera-\ntion of dozens of different facts in order to make an indi-\nvidualized determination about each defendant. In the\nreal world, they would contend, it is difficult, if not impos-\nsible, to determine whether any given fact was legally\nessential to the punishment imposed. But identifying the\nparticular fatal fact is not necessary to identifying a con-\nstitutional violation. In the second hypothetical given\nabove, for example, it is not possible to say which single\nfact, or which combination of facts, sufficed to bring the\nsentence within the bounds of the \u201creasonable.\u201d But it is\npossible to say (indeed, it must be said) that some judge-\nfound fact or combination of facts had that effect\u2014and\nthat suffices to establish a Sixth Amendment violation.\n     \u201cWhether the judge\u2019s authority to impose an enhanced\n     sentence depends on finding a specified fact . . ., one of\n     several specified facts . . ., or any aggravating fact . . .,\n     it remains the case that the jury\u2019s verdict alone does\n     not authorize the sentence. The judge acquires that\n     authority only upon finding some additional fact.\u201d\n     Blakely, supra, at 305.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Perhaps I am too cynical. At least one conscientious District Judge\nhas decided to shoulder the burden of ascertaining what the maximum\nreasonable sentence is in each case based only on the verdict and\nappellate precedent, correctly concluding that this is the only way to\neliminate Sixth Amendment problems after Cunningham if Booker\nmandates substantive reasonableness review.

S. 62, 95\u201396 (1990) (SCALIA,\n    J., dissenting) (footnote omitted).\nThis consideration has no application here. In the federal\nsystem, prior to the SRA, substantive appellate review of a\ndistrict court\u2019s sentencing discretion essentially did not\nexist. See, e.g., Dorszynski v. United States, 418 U. S. 424,\n431 (1974) (noting \u201cthe general proposition that once it is\ndetermined that a sentence is within the limitations set\nforth in the statute under which it is imposed, appellate\nreview is at an end\u201d); id., at 443 (\u201c[W]ell-established doc-\ntrine bars review of the exercise of sentencing discretion\u201d).\nAs for state appellate review of sentences, as late as 1962,\nat least 39 States did not permit appellate courts to mod-\nify sentences imposed within the statutory limits. See\nAppellate Review of Sentences, A Symposium at the Judi-\ncial Conference of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit, 32 F. R. D. 249, 260 (1962).

As for congressional intent: Of course\nCongress intended that judge-found facts be legally essen-\ntial to the punishment imposed; that was the whole reason\nthe mandatory Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment.\nIf we are now to indulge a newfound respect for unconsti-\ntutional congressional intent, we should reimpose the\nmandatory Guidelines system.           The quasi-Guidelines\nsystem the Court creates today manages to contravene\nboth congressional intent and the Sixth Amendment.\n   As for the \u201cintent\u201d of the Booker remedial opinion: That\nopinion purported to be divining congressional intent in\nlight of what the Sixth Amendment compelled. See 543\nU. S., at 263\u2013265. Absent some explanation of why sub-\nstantive reasonableness review does not cause judge-found\nfacts to justify greater punishment than the jury\u2019s verdict\nor the defendant\u2019s guilty plea would sustain, I fail to un-\nderstand how such review could possibly have been in-\ntended by all five Justices who composed the Booker re-\nmedial majority. After all, at least one of them did not\nintend \u201cto override Blakely, and to render academic the\nentire first part of Booker itself,\u201d and has confirmed that\n\u201c[t]here would have been no majority in Booker for the\nrevision of Blakely essayed in [JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s Cunning-\nham] dissent.\u201d Cunningham, 549 U.

C. \u00a73742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV)), but the reme-\ndial majority\u2019s creation of reasonableness review gave\nappellate courts the necessary means to reverse a district\ncourt that: appears not to have considered \u00a73553(a); con-\nsiders impermissible factors; selects a sentence based on\nclearly erroneous facts; or does not comply with \u00a73553(c)\u2019s\nrequirement for a statement of reasons.6 In addition to its\ndirect effect on sentencing uniformity, this procedural\nreview will indirectly produce, over time, reduction of\nsentencing disparities. By ensuring that district courts\ngive reasons for their sentences, and more specific reasons\nwhen they decline to follow the advisory Guidelines range,\nsee \u00a73553(c)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), appellate courts will\nenable the Sentencing Commission to perform its function\nof revising the Guidelines to reflect the desirable sentenc-\ning practices of the district courts. See Booker, supra, at\n264 (citing 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV)).

S. C. \u00a73742(f) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which limits\nappellate courts to reversing sentences that are imposed\n\u201cin violation of law\u201d or \u201cas a result of an incorrect applica-\ntion of the sentencing guidelines,\u201d \u00a73742(f)(1), or that fall\nin certain categories and are either \u201ctoo high\u201d or \u201ctoo low,\u201d\n\u00a73742(f)(2).8 But, as I noted in Booker, \u00a73742(e) and\n\u00a73742(f) are inextricably intertwined: Having excised\n\u00a73742(e)\u2019s provisions setting forth the standards for appel-\nlate review, it is nonsensical to continue to apply \u00a73742(f)\u2019s\nprovisions governing the \u201cDecision and Disposition\u201d of\nappeals, which clearly track those now-excised standards.\nSee 543 U. S., at 306\u2013307 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part).\nI would hold that \u00a73742(f) is \u201cincapable of functioning\nindependently\u201d of the provisions excised in Booker, and is\nthus inseverable from them. See Alaska Airlines, Inc. v.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Courts must resist, however, the temptation to make procedural\n\nreview more stringent because substantive review is off the table. The\njudicial role when conducting severability analysis is limited to deter-\nmining whether the balance of a statute that contains an unconstitu-\ntional provision is capable \u201cof functioning independently.\u201d Alaska\nAirlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987). Courts have no power\nto add provisions that might be desirable now that certain provisions\nhave been excised. Thus, when engaging in reasonableness review to\ndetermine whether the district court has complied with the various\nprocedures in \u00a73553, an appellate court cannot subject the district court\nto any greater requirements than existed pre-Booker.\n   8 I say \u201cpossible\u201d because one could claim that the failure to comply\n\nwith 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553\u2019s procedural requirements results in a sentence\nimposed in violation of law, and thereby covered by \u00a73742(f)(1). But\n\u00a73742(f)(1)\u2019s applicability to such procedural errors is called into\nquestion by \u00a73742(f)(2), which specifically addresses sentences where\n\u201cthe district court failed to provide the required statement of reasons\n[mandated by \u00a73553(c)(2)].\u201d For the reasons specified in the text,\nhowever, I see no need to grapple, post-Booker, with the proper inter-\npretation of \u00a73742(f).\n18                RITA v.

A very\ngeneral overview of the course of decisions over the past\neight years may help to put today\u2019s holding in perspective.\n   Members of a criminal jury are guaranteed to be impar-\ntial residents of the State and district of the crime, but the\nSixth Amendment right to trial by jury otherwise relies on\nhistory for details, and the practical instincts of judges\nand legislators for implementation in the courts. Litiga-\ntion has, for example, worked through issues of size, see\nBallew v. Georgia, 435 U. S. 223 (1978) (prohibiting five-\nperson state juries but allowing juries of six), and unanim-\nity, see Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U. S. 404 (1972) (allowing\nnonunanimous juries in state criminal trials); Burch v.\nLouisiana, 441 U. S. 130 (1979) (prohibiting nonunani-\nmous six-person juries). Such decisions go to what Wil-\nliam James would have called the \u201ccash-value\u201d of the\nConstitution\u2019s guarantee. See W. James, Pragmatism: A\nNew Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking 200 (1st ed.\n1907).\n   One additional issue of both detail and implementation\nis the line between judge and jury in determining facts,\nand in particular the legitimate extent of factfinding by a\njudge when sentencing a defendant after a guilty plea or a\n2                  RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\njury\u2019s verdict of guilty. Since the very inception of judicial\ndiscretion in determining a sentence, judges have acted on\nwhat they learn in the course of a trial (and later what\nthey gather from a presentence report or other evidence at\ntime of sentencing), including details a trial jury may not\nhave found to be true when it returned the guilty verdict\nor answered a special question. But historically, also, the\ncustomary judicial use of these extraverdict facts has been\nin deciding on a sentence within a range set in advance by\nthe statute defining the crime in question. See Williams v.\nNew York, 337 U. S. 241, 246\u2013247 (1949). Thus, tradi-\ntionally when a judge imposed a sentence at some point in\nthe range, say, of 0-to-5 years specified by statute for some\noffense, every fact necessary to go as high as five years\nhad been found by the jury (or admitted), even though the\njury had not made particular or implicit findings of the\nfacts the judge might consider in exercising discretion to\nset the sentence higher or lower within the 5-year range.\n   It was against this background, in Jones v. United\nStates, 526 U. S. 227 (1999), that we called attention to a\nserious threat to the practical value of a criminal defen-\ndant\u2019s jury right. Jones had been prosecuted under a\nstatute that exemplified a growing practice of providing a\ndefinition and penalty for some basic crime subject to the\nright of jury trial, but then identifying variants carrying\nhigher ranges of penalties depending on facts that argua-\nbly might be found by a judge sitting alone. Thus, Jones\nwas convicted solely of carjacking, but if the further fact of\ncausing \u201c \u2018serious bodily injury\u2019 \u201d was shown, the maximum\npenalty jumped from 15 years to 25. Id., at 230 (quoting\n18 U. S. C. \u00a72119 (1988 ed., Supp. V)). The Government\u2019s\nposition was that the extra fact of serious bodily injury\nraising the penalty range required no jury finding because\nit was only a condition for imposing an enhanced sentence,\nup to a judge, not an element of a more serious crime,\nsubject to the right to a jury\u2019s determination. See Jones,\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           3\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\n526 U. S., at 233.\n   It was an unsettling argument, because in prosecutions\nunder these statutory schemes the most serious issue in\nthe case might well be not guilt or innocence of the basic\noffense, but liability to the substantially enhanced pen-\nalty. If, for example, the judge found that Jones had\ncaused not just serious bodily injury, but death, such\nextraverdict factfinding could have made the difference\nbetween 15 years and life imprisonment. Id., at 230 (quot-\ning \u00a72119 (1988 ed., Supp. V)). In a case like that, giving\njudges the exclusive power to find the facts necessary to\nsentence in the higher range would make the jury a mere\ngatekeeper to the more important trial before a judge\nalone. Id., at 243\u2013244. The Sixth Amendment does not, of\ncourse, speak expressly to such a scheme, but that is not a\nsufficient reason to give it constitutional approval. For if\njudicial factfinding necessary for an enhanced sentencing\nrange were held to be adequate in the face of a defendant\u2019s\nobjection, a defendant\u2019s right to have a jury standing\nbetween himself and the power of the government to\ncurtail his liberty would take on a previously unsuspected\nmodesty.\n   Jones accordingly treated this practice as suspect\nenough to call for applying the doctrine of constitutional\navoidance when the Court interpreted the statute in ques-\ntion. What the Government called a mere condition for\nimposing a sentencing enhancement was treated as an\nelement of a more serious offense and made subject to a\njury\u2019s factfinding. This interpretation obviated the consti-\ntutional decision whether subjecting an unwilling defen-\ndant to a more onerous range of sentence on facts found\nsolely by a judge would violate the Sixth Amendment.\n   The issue did not go away with Jones, and the constitu-\ntional challenge was soon presented inescapably, in Ap-\nprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000). We held that\nexposing a defendant to an increased penalty beyond the\n4                     RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nrange for a basic crime, based on facts determined exclu-\nsively by a judge, violated the Sixth Amendment, in the\nabsence of a jury waiver; a defendant could not be sub-\njected to a penalty more serious than one authorized by\nthe facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.\nId., at 490.1 A judge could constitutionally determine facts\nfor exercising discretion in sentencing up to that point, but\na fact that raised the range of possible penalties func-\ntioned like an element of a more serious offense, even if a\nstatute ostensibly tied that fact to the sentence alone.\nHence, in the absence of waiver, a sentence in that weight-\nier range could be imposed by a judge only if the enhanc-\ning fact was found beyond a reasonable doubt by the trial\njury. Ibid. In placing disputed factfinding off judicial\nlimits when, but only when, its effect would be to raise the\nrange of possible sentences, we made a practical judgment\nthat maintained the historical judicial role in finding facts\nrelevant to sentencing within the range set by a jury\u2019s\nverdict, but we recognized that the jury right would be\ntrivialized beyond recognition if that traditional practice\ncould be extended to the point that a judge alone (over\nobjection) could find a fact necessary to raise the upper\nlimit of a sentencing range.\n   From the moment Apprendi drew that line, however, its\nholding carried apparent implications for the regime of\nGuidelines sentencing adopted in 1984, see Sentencing\nReform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73551 et seq.\n(2000 ed. and Supp. IV), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7991 et seq. (2000 ed.\nand Supp. IV). The general object of Guidelines sentenc-\ning was the eminently laudable one of promoting substan-\ntial consistency in exercising judicial discretion to sen-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 We recognized a single exception to this rule, permitting reliance on\n\nthe fact of a prior conviction without a jury determination that the\ndefendant had previously been convicted. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at\n489\u2013490; see also Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224\n(1998).\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           5\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ntence within the range set by statute for a given crime.\nThus, at the elementary level, the Guidelines law limits\nthe sentence that a judge may impose even within the\nsentencing range provided by the statute creating a par-\nticular offense. In effect, it divides a basic sentencing\nrange into subranges and assigns an offender to a\nsubrange based on the particular facts of the case and the\noffender\u2019s criminal history. A judge may depart from the\nassigned subrange only if the case presents a circumstance\n\u201cnot adequately taken into consideration by the Sentenc-\ning Commission in formulating the guidelines.\u201d           18\nU. S. C. \u00a73553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). It follows that a\njudge must find facts beyond those necessary for the jury\u2019s\nguilty verdict to sentence above (or below, for that matter)\nthe subrange designated for an offender with a compara-\nble criminal history whose case presents no relevant facts\nbeyond the formal elements of the crime itself. The result\nis a hybrid sentencing practice. One could describe it by\nemphasizing that the judge\u2019s factfinding could never in-\ncrease the sentence beyond the range set by the law defin-\ning the crime, or one could stress that a principal motiva-\ntion for Guidelines sentencing is eliminating some\ntraditional judicial discretion by forbidding a judge to\nimpose a high sentence except on the basis of some fact\nbeyond those necessary for a guilty verdict (and thus\nsubject to the right to a jury\u2019s determination).\n   In Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004), consid-\nering a state sentencing system similar to the federal\nscheme, we decided that the latter way of looking at it\nmade more sense, if Apprendi was going to mean some-\nthing in preserving the historical significance of the jury.\nSee 542 U. S., at 305\u2013306. We held that the additional\nfactfinding necessary for a judge to sentence within a high\nsubrange was comparable to the finding of additional fact\nrequired for a judge to impose an enhanced sentence\nunder the law considered in Apprendi. If Blakely had\n6                 RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ncome out the other way, the significance of Apprendi itself\nwould be in jeopardy: a legislature would be free to bypass\nApprendi by providing an abnormally spacious sentencing\nrange for any basic crime (theoretically exposing a defen-\ndant to the highest sentence just by the jury\u2019s guilty ver-\ndict), then leaving it to a judge to make supplementary\nfindings not only appropriate but necessary for a sentence\nin a subrange at the high end. That would spell the end of\nApprendi and diminish the real significance of jury protec-\ntion that Apprendi had shored up.\n   In United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), a ma-\njority of the Court applied Blakely\u2019s reasoning and held\nthat the Federal Guidelines, too, subjected defendants to\nunconstitutional sentences in upper subranges, absent a\njury finding or waiver. So far, so good for the Sixth\nAmendment, but there was the further issue of remedy,\nand at that step consistency began to falter. If statutory\nGuidelines were to survive, there were two serious alter-\nnatives. One was already in place in courts with the\nforesight to apply Apprendi to the Guidelines: require any\nadditional facts necessary for a possible high subrange\nsentence to be charged and submitted to the jury. True,\nthe Government would have to think ahead (and could not\ncharge relevant facts that emerged unexpectedly at trial).\nBut the mandatory character of the Guidelines would be\npreserved, the goal of consistency would continue to be\nserved, and the practical value of the jury right would not\nface erosion.\n   The second remedial alternative was a declaration by\nthe Court that the Guidelines were not mandatory but\ndiscretionary, so that finding extraverdict facts was not\nstrictly necessary for sentencing in a high subrange under\nthe Guidelines. On this alternative, a judge who found a\nsubsidiary fact specified as a condition for a high subrange\nsentence might decide to impose a low sentence (inde-\npendently of the Guidelines\u2019 own provisions for downward\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           7\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ndeparture), and a judge who found no such fact might\nsentence within the high subrange for other reasons that\nseemed sufficient. If the Guidelines were not mandatory,\nthe subsidiary fact merely provided one reasoned basis for\na traditional exercise of discretion to sentence at the high\nend of the sentencing range provided by the statute defin-\ning the crime.\n   But that second alternative could not be so simple: it\nraised yet further issues, and the reconfigured majority of\nthe Court that in fact adopted it, see 543 U. S., at 244,\nguaranteed that we would have the case now before us. If\ndistrict judges treated the now-discretionary Guidelines\nsimply as worthy of consideration but open to rejection in\nany given case, the Booker remedy would threaten a re-\nturn to the old sentencing regime and would presumably\nproduce the apparent disuniformity that convinced Con-\ngress to adopt Guidelines sentencing in the first place.\nBut if sentencing judges attributed substantial gravita-\ntional pull to the now-discretionary Guidelines, if they\ntreated the Guidelines result as persuasive or presump-\ntively appropriate, the Booker remedy would in practical\nterms preserve the very feature of the Guidelines that\nthreatened to trivialize the jury right. For a presumption\nof Guidelines reasonableness would tend to produce\nGuidelines sentences almost as regularly as mandatory\nGuidelines had done, with judges finding the facts needed\nfor a sentence in an upper subrange. This would open the\ndoor to undermining Apprendi itself, and this is what has\nhappened today.\n   Without a powerful reason to risk reversal on the sen-\ntence, a district judge faced with evidence supporting a\nhigh subrange Guidelines sentence will do the appropriate\nfactfinding in disparagement of the jury right and will\nsentence within the high subrange. This prediction is\nweakened not a whit by the Court\u2019s description of within-\nGuidelines reasonableness as an \u201cappellate\u201d presumption,\n8                   RITA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nante, at 11 (emphasis deleted). What works on appeal\ndetermines what works at trial, and if the Sentencing\nCommission\u2019s views are as weighty as the Court says they\nare, see ante, at 8\u201312, a trial judge will find it far easier to\nmake the appropriate findings and sentence within the\nappropriate Guideline, than to go through the unorthodox\nfactfinding necessary to justify a sentence outside the\nGuidelines range, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(c)(2) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV). The upshot is that today\u2019s decision moves the\nthreat to the practical value of the Sixth Amendment jury\nright closer to what it was when this Court flagged it in\nJones, and it seems fair to ask just what has been accom-\nplished in real terms by all the judicial labor imposed by\nApprendi and its associated cases.\n   Taking the Booker remedy (of discretionary Guidelines)\nas a given, however, the way to avoid further risk to Ap-\nprendi and the jury right is to hold that a discretionary\nwithin-Guidelines sentence carries no presumption of\nreasonableness. Only if sentencing decisions are reviewed\naccording to the same standard of reasonableness whether\nor not they fall within the Guidelines range will district\ncourts be assured that the entire sentencing range set by\nstatute is available to them. See Booker, supra, at 263\n(calling for a reasonableness standard \u201cacross the board\u201d).\nAnd only then will they stop replicating the unconstitu-\ntional system by imposing appeal-proof sentences within\nthe Guidelines ranges determined by facts found by them\nalone.\n   I would therefore reject the presumption of reasonable-\nness adopted in this case, not because it is pernicious in\nand of itself, but because I do not think we can recognize\nsuch a presumption and still retain the full effect of Ap-\nprendi in aid of the Sixth Amendment guarantee. But I\nwould not stop at rejecting the presumption.

Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"143790\"><a href=\"/opinion/143790/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 261-263, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Several Circuits have held that, when doing so, they will presume that a sentence imposed within a properly calculated United States Sentencing Guidelines range is a reasonable sentence. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 177 Fed. Appx. 357, 358 (C.A.4 2006) <i>(per curiam)</i> (case below); see also United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov.2006) (USSG or Guidelines). The most important question before us is whether the law permits the courts of appeals to use this presumption. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The basic crime in this case concerns two false statements which Victor Rita, the petitioner, made under oath to a federal grand jury. The jury was investigating a gun company called InterOrdnance. Prosecutors believed that buyers of an InterOrdnance kit, called a \"PPSH 41 machinegun `parts kit,'\" could assemble a machinegun from the kit, that those kits consequently amounted to machineguns, and that InterOrdnance had not secured proper registrations for the importation of the guns. App. 7, 16-19, 21-22.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2460</span> Rita had bought a PPSH 41 machinegun parts kit. Rita, when contacted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), agreed to let a federal agent inspect the kit. <i>Id.,</i> at 119-120; Supp.App. 5-8. But before meeting with the agent, Rita called InterOrdnance and then sent back the kit. He subsequently turned over to ATF a different kit that apparently did not amount to a machinegun. App. 23-24, 120; Supp.App. 2-5, 8-10, 13-14.</p>\n<p>The investigating prosecutor brought Rita before the grand jury, placed him under oath, and asked him about these matters. Rita denied that the Government agent had asked him for the PPSH kit, and also denied that he had spoken soon thereafter about the PPSH kit to someone at InterOrdnance. App. 19, 120-121; Supp.App. 11-12. The Government claimed these statements were false, charged Rita with perjury, making false statements, and obstructing justice, and, after a jury trial, obtained convictions on all counts. App. 7-13, 94, 103.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The parties subsequently proceeded to sentencing. Initially, a probation officer, with the help of the parties, and after investigating the background both of the offenses and of the offender, prepared a presentence report. See Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 32(c)-(d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3552(a). The completed report describes \"offense characteristics,\" \"offender characteristics,\" and other matters that might be relevant to the sentence, and then calculates a Guidelines sentence. The report also sets forth factors potentially relevant to a departure from the Guidelines or relevant to the imposition of an other-than-Guidelines sentence. It ultimately makes a sentencing recommendation based on the Guidelines. App. 115-136.</p>\n<p>In respect to \"offense characteristics,\" for example, the report points out that the five counts of conviction all stem from a single incident. <i>Id.,</i> at 122. Hence, pursuant to the Guidelines, the report, in calculating a recommended sentence, groups the five counts of conviction together, treating them as if they amounted to the single most serious count among them (and ignoring all others). See USSG \u00a7 3D1.1. The single most serious offense in Rita's case is \"perjury.\" The relevant Guideline, \u00a7 2J1.3(c)(1), instructs the sentencing court (and the probation officer) to calculate the Guidelines sentence for \"perjury. . . in respect to a criminal offense\" by applying the Guideline for an \"accessory after the fact,\" as to that criminal offense. \u00a7 2X3.1. And that latter Guideline says that the judge, for calculation purposes, should take as a base offense level, a level that is \"6 levels lower than the offense level for the <i>underlying offense,</i>\" (emphasis added) (the offense that the perjury may have helped someone commit). Here the \"underlying offense\" consisted of InterOrdnance's possible violation of the machinegun registration law. App. 124; USSG \u00a7 2M5.2 (providing sentence for violation of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778(b)(2), importation of defense articles without authorization). The base offense level for the gun registration crime is 26. See USSG \u00a7 2M5.2. Six levels less is 20. And 20, says the presentence report, is the base offense level applicable to Rita for purposes of Guidelines sentence calculation. App. 45.</p>\n<p>The presentence report next considers Rita's \"Criminal History.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 125. Rita was convicted in May 1986, and sentenced to five years' probation for making false statements in connection with the purchase of firearms. Because this conviction took place more than 10 years before the present offense, it did not count <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2461</span> against Rita. And because Rita had no other relevant convictions, the Guidelines considered him as having no \"criminal history points.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The report consequently places Rita in criminal history category I, the lowest category for purposes of calculating a Guidelines' sentence.</p>\n<p>The report goes on to describe other \"Offender Characteristics.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 126. The description includes Rita's personal and family data, Rita's physical condition (including a detailed description of ailments), Rita's mental and emotional health, the lack of any history of substance abuse, Rita's vocational and nonvocational education, and Rita's employment record. It states that he served in the Armed Forces for over 25 years, on active duty and in the Reserve. During that time he received 35 commendations, awards, or medals of different kinds. The report analyzes Rita's financial condition. <i>Id.,</i> at 126-132.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the report calculates the Guidelines sentencing range. <i>Id.,</i> at 132. The Guidelines specify for base level 20, criminal history category I, a sentence of 33-to-41 months' imprisonment. <i>Ibid.</i> The report adds that there \"appears to be no circumstance or combination of circumstances that warrant a departure from the prescribed sentencing guidelines.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 133.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, both Rita and the Government presented their sentencing arguments. Each side addressed the report. Rita argued for a sentence outside (and lower than) the recommended Guidelines 33-to-41 month range.</p>\n<p>The judge made clear that Rita's argument for a lower sentence could take either of two forms. First, Rita might argue <i>within the Guidelines' framework,</i> for a departure from the applicable Guidelines range on the ground that his circumstances present an \"atypical case\" that falls outside the \"heartland\" to which the United States Sentencing Commission intends each individual Guideline to apply. USSG \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(2). Second, Rita might argue that, independent of the Guidelines, application of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) warrants a lower sentence. See <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 259-260, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>Thus, the judge asked Rita's counsel, \"Are you going to put on evidence to show that [Rita] should be getting a downward departure, or under 3553, your client would be entitled to a different sentence than he should get under sentencing guidelines?\" App. 52. And the judge later summarized:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Y]ou're asking for a departure from the guidelines or a sentence under 3553 that is lower than the guidelines, and here are the reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"One, he is a vulnerable defendant because he's been involved in [government criminal justice] work which has caused people to become convicted criminals who are in prison and there may be retribution against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Two, his military experience. . . .\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.,</i> at 64-65.</p>\n<p>Counsel agreed, while adding that Rita's poor physical condition constituted a third reason. And counsel said that he rested his claim for a lower sentence on \"[j]ust [those] three\" special circumstances, \"[p]hysical condition, vulnerability in prison and the military service.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 65. Rita presented evidence and argument related to these three factors. The Government, while not asking for a sentence higher than the report's recommended Guidelines range, said that Rita's perjury had interfered with the Government's potential <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2462</span> \"obstruction of justice\" claim against InterOrdnance and that Rita, as a former Government criminal justice employee, should have known better than to commit perjury. <i>Id.,</i> at 74-77. The sentencing judge asked questions about each factor.</p>\n<p>After hearing the arguments, the judge concluded that he was \"unable to find that the [report's recommended] sentencing guideline range . . . is an inappropriate guideline range for that, and under 3553. . . the public needs to be protected if it is true, and I must accept as true the jury verdict.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 87. The court concluded: \"So the Court finds that it is appropriate to enter\" a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range, namely a sentence of imprisonment \"for a period of 33 months.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Rita argued that his 33-month sentence was \"unreasonable\" because (1) it did not adequately take account of \"the defendant's history and characteristics,\" and (2) it \"is greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).\" Brief for Appellant in No. 05-4674 (CA4), pp. i, 8. The Fourth Circuit observed that it must set aside a sentence that is not \"reasonable.\" The Circuit stated that \"a sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range . . . is presumptively reasonable.\" It added that \"while we believe that the appropriate circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the guideline range will depend on the facts of individual cases, we have no reason to doubt that most sentences will continue to fall within the applicable guideline range.\" The Fourth Circuit then rejected Rita's arguments and upheld the sentence. <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E</h2>\n<p>Rita petitioned for a writ of certiorari. He pointed out that the Circuits are split as to the use of a presumption of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentences. Compare <i>United States v.

We agreed to decide whether a circuit court may afford a \"presumption of reasonableness\" to a \"within-Guidelines\" sentence. We also agreed to decide whether the District Court properly analyzed the relevant sentencing factors and whether, given the record, the District Court's ultimate choice of a 33-month sentence was \"unreasonable.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The first question is whether a court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines. We conclude that it can.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2463</span> A</h2>\n<p>For one thing, the presumption is not binding. It does not, like a trial-related evidentiary presumption, insist that one side, or the other, shoulder a particular burden of persuasion or proof lest they lose their case. C.f., <i>e.g., </i><i>Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131147\"><a href=\"/opinion/131147/raytheon-co-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 49-50, n. 3, 124 S.Ct. 513, 157 L.Ed.2d 357 (2003) (citing <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), and <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Nor does the presumption reflect strong judicial deference of the kind that leads appeals courts to grant greater factfinding leeway to an expert agency than to a district judge. Rather, the presumption reflects the fact that, by the time an appeals court is considering a within-Guidelines sentence on review, <i>both</i> the sentencing judge and the Sentencing Commission will have reached the <i>same</i> conclusion as to the proper sentence in the particular case. That double determination significantly increases the likelihood that the sentence is a reasonable one.</p>\n<p>Further, the presumption reflects the nature of the Guidelines-writing task that Congress set for the Commission and the manner in which the Commission carried out that task. In instructing both the <i>sentencing judge</i> and the <i>Commission</i> what to do, Congress referred to the basic sentencing objectives that the statute sets forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). That provision tells the <i>sentencing judge</i> to consider (1) offense and offender characteristics; (2) the need for a sentence to reflect the basic aims of sentencing, namely (a) \"just punishment\" (retribution), (b) deterrence, (c) incapacitation, (d) rehabilitation; (3) the sentences legally available; (4) the Sentencing Guidelines; (5) Sentencing Commission policy statements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted disparities; and (7) the need for restitution. The provision also tells the sentencing judge to \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with\" the basic aims of sentencing as set out above.</p>\n<p>Congressional statutes then tell the <i>Commission</i> to write Guidelines that will carry out these same \u00a7 3553(a) objectives. Thus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991(b) indicates that one of the Commission's basic objectives is to \"assure the meeting of the purposes of sentencing as set forth in [\u00a7 3553(a)(2)].\" The provision adds that the Commission must seek to \"provide certainty and fairness\" in sentencing, to \"avoi[d] unwarranted sentencing disparities,\" to \"maintai[n] sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors not taken into account in the establishment of general sentencing practices,\" and to \"reflect, to the extent practicable [sentencing-relevant] advancement in [the] knowledge of human behavior.\" Later provisions specifically instruct the Commission to write the Guidelines with reference to this statement of purposes, the statement that itself refers to \u00a7 3553(a). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 994(f), and 994(m).</p>\n<p>The upshot is that the sentencing statutes envision both the sentencing judge and the Commission as carrying out the same basic \u00a7 3553(a) objectives, the one, at retail, the other at wholesale.</p>\n<p>The Commission has made a serious, sometimes controversial, effort to carry out this mandate. The Commission, in describing its Guidelines-writing efforts, refers to these same statutory provisions. It says that it has tried to embody in the Guidelines the factors and considerations set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). The Commission's introductory statement recognizes that Congress \"foresees guidelines that will <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2464</span> further the basic purposes of criminal punishment, <i>i.e.,</i> deterring crime, incapacitating the offender, providing just punishment, and rehabilitating the offender.\" USSG \u00a7 1A.1, intro to comment., pt. A, \u00b6 2 (The Statutory Mission). It adds that Congress \"sought <i>uniformity</i> in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed by different federal courts for similar criminal conduct,\" as well as \"<i>proportionality</i> in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of different severity.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (The Basic Approach).</p>\n<p>The Guidelines commentary explains how, despite considerable disagreement within the criminal justice community, the Commission has gone about writing Guidelines that it intends to embody these ends. It says, for example, that the goals of <i>uniformity</i> and <i>proportionality</i> often conflict. The commentary describes the difficulties involved in developing a practical sentencing system that sensibly reconciles the two ends. It adds that a \"philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile the differing perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment.\" Some would emphasize moral culpability and \"just punishment\"; others would emphasize the need for \"crime control.\" Rather than choose among differing practical and philosophical objectives, the Commission took an \"empirical approach,\" beginning with an empirical examination of 10,000 presentence reports setting forth what judges had done in the past and then modifying and adjusting past practice in the interests of greater rationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with congressional instructions, and the like. <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 3, at 3.</p>\n<p>The Guidelines as written reflect the fact that the Sentencing Commission examined tens of thousands of sentences and worked with the help of many others in the law enforcement community over a long period of time in an effort to fulfill this statutory mandate. They also reflect the fact that different judges (and others) can differ as to how best to reconcile the disparate ends of punishment.</p>\n<p>The Commission's work is ongoing. The statutes and the Guidelines themselves foresee continuous evolution helped by the sentencing courts and courts of appeals in that process. The sentencing courts, applying the Guidelines in individual cases may depart (either pursuant to the Guidelines or, since <i>Booker,</i> by imposing a non-Guidelines sentence). The judges will set forth their reasons. The Courts of Appeals will determine the reasonableness of the resulting sentence. The Commission will collect and examine the results. In doing so, it may obtain advice from prosecutors, defenders, law enforcement groups, civil liberties associations, experts in penology, and others. And it can revise the Guidelines accordingly. See generally 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(p) and note following \u00a7 994 (Commission should review and amend Guidelines as necessary, and Congress has power to revoke or amend Guidelines); <i>Mistretta v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112173\"><a href=\"/opinion/112173/mistretta-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 393-394, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989); USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (listing 24 amendments promulgated in response to evolving sentencing concerns); USSG \u00a7 1A1.1, comment.</p>\n<p>The result is a set of Guidelines that seek to embody the \u00a7 3553(a) considerations, both in principle and in practice. Given the difficulties of doing so, the abstract and potentially conflicting nature of \u00a7 3553(a)'s general sentencing objectives, and the differences of philosophical view among those who work within the criminal justice community as to how best to apply general sentencing objectives, it is fair to assume that the Guidelines, insofar as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2465</span> practicable, reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve \u00a7 3553(a)'s objectives.</p>\n<p>An individual judge who imposes a sentence within the range recommended by the Guidelines thus makes a decision that is fully consistent with the Commission's judgment in general. Despite Justice SOUTER's fears to the contrary, <i>post,</i> at 2487-2488 (dissenting opinion), the courts of appeals' \"reasonableness\" presumption, rather than having independent legal effect, simply recognizes the real-world circumstance that when the judge's discretionary decision accords with the Commission's view of the appropriate application of \u00a7 3553(a) in the mine run of cases, it is probable that the sentence is reasonable. Indeed, even the Circuits that have declined to adopt a formal presumption also recognize that a Guidelines sentence will usually be reasonable, because it reflects both the Commission's and the sentencing court's judgment as to what is an appropriate sentence for a given offender. See <i>Fernandez,</i> 443 F.3d, at 27; <i>Cooper,</i> 437 F.3d, at 331; <i>Talley,</i> 431 F.3d, at 788.</p>\n<p>We repeat that the presumption before us is an <i>appellate</i> court presumption. Given our explanation in <i>Booker</i> that appellate \"reasonableness\" review merely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion, the presumption applies only on appellate review. The sentencing judge, as a matter of process, will normally begin by considering the presentence report and its interpretation of the Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3552(a); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32. He may hear arguments by prosecution or defense that the Guidelines sentence should not apply, perhaps because (as the Guidelines themselves foresee) the case at hand falls outside the \"heartland\" to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply, USSG \u00a7 5K2.0, perhaps because the Guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a) considerations, or perhaps because the case warrants a different sentence regardless. See Rule 32(f). Thus, the sentencing court subjects the defendant's sentence to the thorough adversarial testing contemplated by federal sentencing procedure. See Rules 32(f), (h), (i)(C) and (i)(D); see also <i>Burns v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 136, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991) (recognizing importance of notice and meaningful opportunity to be heard at sentencing). In determining the merits of these arguments, the sentencing court does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should apply. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 259-260, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Rita and his supporting <i>amici</i> make two further arguments against use of the presumption. First, Rita points out that many individual Guidelines apply higher sentences in the presence of special facts, for example, brandishing a weapon. In many cases, the sentencing judge, not the jury, will determine the existence of those facts. A pro-Guidelines \"presumption of reasonableness\" will increase the likelihood that courts of appeals will affirm such sentences, thereby increasing the likelihood that sentencing judges will impose such sentences. For that reason, Rita says, the presumption raises Sixth Amendment \"concerns.\" Brief for Petitioner 28.</p>\n<p>In our view, however, the presumption, even if it increases the likelihood that the judge, not the jury, will find \"sentencing facts,\" does not violate the Sixth Amendment. This Court's Sixth Amendment cases do not automatically forbid a sentencing court to take account of factual matters not determined by a jury and to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2466</span> increase the sentence in consequence. Nor do they prohibit the sentencing judge from taking account of the Sentencing Commission's factual findings or recommended sentences. See <i>Cunningham v. California,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 856, 863-864, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007), (citing <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 243-244, 125 S.Ct. 738; <i>Blakely v.

Still less does it <i>forbid</i> the sentencing judge from imposing a sentence higher than the Guidelines provide for the jury-determined facts standing alone. As far as the law is concerned, the judge could disregard the Guidelines and apply the same sentence (higher than the statutory minimum or the bottom of the unenhanced Guidelines range) in the absence of the special facts (say, gun brandishing) which, in the view of the Sentencing Commission, would warrant a higher sentence within the statutorily permissible range. Thus, our Sixth Amendment cases do not forbid appellate court use of the presumption.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA concedes that the Sixth Amendment concerns he foresees are not presented by this case. <i>Post,</i> at 2478 (concurring in part and concurring in judgment). And his need to rely on <i>hypotheticals</i> to make his point is consistent with our view that the approach adopted here will not \"raise a multitude of constitutional problems.\" <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137741\"><a href=\"/opinion/137741/clark-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 380-381, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005). Similarly, Justice SCALIA agrees that we have never held that \"the Sixth Amendment prohibits judges from ever finding any facts\" relevant to sentencing. <i>Post,</i> at 2477. In sentencing, as in other areas, district judges at times make mistakes that are substantive. At times, they will impose sentences that are unreasonable. Circuit courts exist to correct <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2467</span> such mistakes when they occur. Our decision in <i>Booker</i> recognized as much, 543 U.S., at 260-264, 125 S.Ct. 738. <i>Booker</i> held unconstitutional that portion of the Guidelines that made them mandatory. <i>Id.,</i> at 233-234, 243-244, 125 S.Ct. 738. It also recognized that when district courts impose discretionary sentences, which are reviewed under normal appellate principles by courts of appeals, such a sentencing scheme will ordinarily raise no Sixth Amendment concern. <i>Ibid</i>; see <i>id.,</i> at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738 (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.) (\"Indeed, everyone agrees that the constitutional issues presented by these cases would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the [federal sentencing statute] the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges\"). That being so, our opinion in <i>Booker</i> made clear that today's holding does not violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Rita may be correct that the presumption will encourage sentencing judges to impose Guidelines sentences. But we do not see how that fact could change the constitutional calculus. Congress sought to diminish unwarranted sentencing disparity. It sought a Guidelines system that would bring about greater fairness in sentencing through increased uniformity. The fact that the presumption might help achieve these congressional goals does not provide cause for holding the presumption unlawful as long as the presumption remains constitutional. And, given our case law, we cannot conclude that the presumption itself violates the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The fact that we permit courts of appeals to adopt a presumption of reasonableness does not mean that courts may adopt a presumption of unreasonableness. Even the Government concedes that appellate courts may not presume that every variance from the advisory Guidelines is unreasonable. See Brief for United States 34-35. Several courts of appeals have also rejected a presumption of unreasonableness. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Howard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794996\"><a href=\"/opinion/794996/united-states-v-anthony-howard/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span>, 703 (C.A.7 2006); <i>United States v.

We will consider that approach next Term in <i>United States v. Gall,</i> No. 06-7949.</p>\n<p>Second, Rita and his <i>amici</i> claim that use of a pro-Guidelines presumption on appeal conflicts with Congress' insistence that sentencing judges apply the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (and that the resulting sentence be \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\" of sentencing set forth in that statute). We have explained above, however, why we believe that, where judge and Commission <i>both</i> determine that the Guidelines sentences is an appropriate sentence for the case at hand, that sentence likely reflects the \u00a7 3553(a) factors (including its \"not greater than necessary\" requirement). See <i>supra,</i> at 2463. This circumstance alleviates any serious general conflict between <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2468</span> \u00a7 3553(a) and the Guidelines, for the purposes of appellate review. And, for that reason, we find that nothing in \u00a7 3553(a) renders use of the presumption unlawful.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We next turn to the question whether the District Court properly analyzed the relevant sentencing factors. In particular, Rita argues that the court took inadequate account of \u00a7 3553(c) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), a provision that requires a sentencing judge, \"at the time of sentencing,\" to \"state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\" In our view, given the straightforward, conceptually simple arguments before the judge, the judge's statement of reasons here, though brief, was legally sufficient.</p>\n<p>The statute does call for the judge to \"state\" his \"reasons.\" And that requirement reflects sound judicial practice. Judicial decisions are reasoned decisions. Confidence in a judge's use of reason underlies the public's trust in the judicial institution. A public statement of those reasons helps provide the public with the assurance that creates that trust.</p>\n<p>That said, we cannot read the statute (or our precedent) as insisting upon a full opinion in every case. The appropriateness of brevity or length, conciseness or detail, when to write, what to say, depends upon circumstances. Sometimes a judicial opinion responds to every argument; sometimes it does not; sometimes a judge simply writes the word \"granted,\" or \"denied\" on the face of a motion while relying upon context and the parties' prior arguments to make the reasons clear. The law leaves much, in this respect, to the judge's own professional judgment.</p>\n<p>In the present context, a statement of reasons is important. The sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties' arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112129\"><a href=\"/opinion/112129/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span>, 336-337, 108 S.Ct. 2413, 101 L.Ed.2d 297 (1988). Nonetheless, when a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation. Circumstances may well make clear that the judge rests his decision upon the Commission's own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is a proper sentence (in terms of \u00a7 3353(a) and other congressional mandates) in the typical case, and that the judge has found that the case before him is typical. Unless a party contests the Guidelines sentence generally under \u00a7 3553(a)\u0097that is argues that the Guidelines reflect an unsound judgment, or, for example, that they do not generally treat certain defendant characteristics in the proper way\u0097or argues for departure, the judge normally need say no more. Cf. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). (Although, often at sentencing a judge will speak at length to a defendant, and this practice may indeed serve a salutary purpose.)</p>\n<p>Where the defendant or prosecutor presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence, however, the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments. Sometimes the circumstances will call for a brief explanation; sometimes they will call for a lengthier explanation. Where the judge imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines, the judge will explain why he has done so. To our knowledge, an ordinary explanation of judicial reasons as to why the judge has, or has not, applied the Guidelines triggers no Sixth Amendment \"jury trial\" requirement. Cf. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738 (\"For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2469</span> has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant\") and <i>id.,</i> at 242, 125 S.Ct. 738 (requirement of finding, not articulation of it, creates Sixth Amendment problem).</p>\n<p>By articulating reasons, even if brief, the sentencing judge not only assures reviewing courts (and the public) that the sentencing process is a reasoned process but also helps that process evolve. The sentencing judge has access to, and greater familiarity with, the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the Commission or the appeals court. That being so, his reasoned sentencing judgment, resting upon an effort to filter the Guidelines' general advice through \u00a7 3553(a)'s list of factors, can provide relevant information to both the court of appeals and ultimately the Sentencing Commission. The reasoned responses of these latter institutions to the sentencing judge's explanation should help the Guidelines constructively evolve over time, as both Congress and the Commission foresaw. See generally <i>supra,</i> at 2464-2465.</p>\n<p>In the present case the sentencing judge's statement of reasons was brief but legally sufficient. Rita argued for a downward departure from the 33-to-41 month Guidelines sentence on the basis of three sets of special circumstances: health, fear of retaliation in prison, and military record. See App. 40-47. He added that, in any event, these same circumstances warrant leniency beyond that contemplated by the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>The record makes clear that the sentencing judge listened to each argument. The judge considered the supporting evidence. The judge was fully aware of defendant's various physical ailments and imposed a sentence that takes them into account. The judge understood that Rita had previously worked in the immigration service where he had been involved in detecting criminal offenses. And he considered Rita's lengthy military service, including over 25 years of service, both on active duty and in the Reserve, and Rita's receipt of 35 medals, awards, and nominations.</p>\n<p>The judge then simply found these circumstances insufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the Guidelines range of 33 to 45 months. <i>Id.,</i> at 87. He said that this range was not \"inappropriate.\" (This, of course, is not the legal standard for imposition of sentence, but taken in context it is plain that the judge so understood.) He immediately added that he found that the 33-month sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range was \"appropriate.\" <i>Ibid.</i> He must have believed that there was not much more to say.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that the judge might have said more. He might have added explicitly that he had heard and considered the evidence and argument; that (as no one before him denied) he thought the Commission in the Guidelines had determined a sentence that was proper in the minerun of roughly similar perjury cases; and that he found that Rita's personal circumstances here were simply not different enough to warrant a different sentence. But context and the record make clear that this, or similar, reasoning, underlies the judge's conclusion. Where a matter is as conceptually simple as in the case at hand and the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments, we do not believe the law requires the judge to write more extensively.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>We turn to the final question: Was the Court of Appeals, after applying its presumption, legally correct in holding that Rita's sentence (a sentence that applied, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2470</span> and did not depart from, the relevant sentencing Guideline) was not \"unreasonable\"? In our view, the Court of Appeals' conclusion was lawful.</p>\n<p>As we previously said, see Part I, <i>supra,</i> the crimes at issue are perjury and obstruction of justice. In essence those offenses involved the making of knowingly false, material statements under oath before a grand jury, thereby impeding its criminal investigation. The Guidelines provide for a typical such offense a base offense level of 20, 6 levels below the level provided for a simple violation of the crime being investigated (here the unlawful importation of machineguns). The offender, Rita, has no countable prior offenses and consequently falls within criminal history category I. The intersection of base offense level 20 and criminal history category I sets forth a sentencing range of imprisonment of 33 to 45 months.</p>\n<p>Rita argued at sentencing that his circumstances are special. He based this argument upon his health, his fear of retaliation, and his prior military record. His sentence explicitly takes health into account by seeking assurance that the Bureau of Prisons will provide appropriate treatment. The record makes out no special fear of retaliation, asserting only that the threat is one that any former law enforcement official might suffer. Similarly, though Rita has a lengthy and distinguished military record, he did not claim at sentencing that military service should ordinarily lead to a sentence more lenient than the sentence the Guidelines impose. Like the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we simply cannot say that Rita's special circumstances are special enough that, in light of \u00a7 3553(a), they require a sentence lower than the sentence the Guidelines provide.</p>\n<p>Finally, Rita and supporting <i>amici</i> here claim that the Guidelines sentence is not reasonable under \u00a7 3553(a) because it expressly declines to consider various personal characteristics of the defendant, such as physical condition, employment record, and military service, under the view that these factors are \"not ordinarily relevant.\" USSG \u00a7\u00a7 5H1.4, 5H1.5, 5H1.11. Rita did not make this argument below, and we shall not consider it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins as to all but Part II, concurring.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that the Court's remedial opinion in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"143790\"><a href=\"/opinion/143790/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was not unanimous. See <i>id.,</i> at 272, 125 S.Ct. 738 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). But <i>Booker</i> is now settled law and must be accepted as such. See B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921) (\"[T]he labor of judges would be increased almost to the breaking point if every past decision could be reopened in every case, and one could not lay one's own course of bricks on the secure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gone before him\"). Therefore, our task today is to apply <i>Booker's</i> \"reasonableness\" standard to a District Judge's decision to impose a sentence within the range recommended by United States Sentencing Guidelines that are now advisory, rather than binding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Simply stated, <i>Booker</i> replaced the <i>de novo</i> standard of review required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) with an abuse-of-discretion standard that we called \"`reasonableness'\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2471</span> review. 543 U.S., at 262, 125 S.Ct. 738. We noted in <i>Booker</i> that the <i>de novo</i> standard was a recent addition to the law. Prior to 2003, appellate courts reviewed sentencing departures for abuse of discretion under our decision in <i>Koon v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). In 2003, however, Congress overruled <i>Koon</i> and added the <i>de novo</i> standard to \u00a7 3742(e). See Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, \u00a7 401(d)(1), 117 Stat. 670. Recognizing that \"the reasons for th[is] revisio[n]\u0097 to make Guidelines sentencing even more mandatory than it had been\u0097 ... ceased to be relevant\" in light of the Court's constitutional holding,<sup>[1]</sup><i>Booker</i> excised the portion of \u00a7 3742(e) that directed courts of appeals to apply the <i>de novo</i> standard. 543 U.S., at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738. Critically, we did not touch the portions of \u00a7 3742(e) requiring appellate courts to \"give due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses,\" to \"accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous,\" and to \"give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\" By leaving those portions of the statute intact while severing the portion mandating a <i>de novo</i> standard of review, <i>Booker</i> restored the abuse-of-discretion standard identified in three earlier cases: <i>Pierce v. Underwood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112137\"><a href=\"/opinion/112137/pierce-v-underwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span>, 558-560, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988), <i>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112457\"><a href=\"/opinion/112457/cooter-gell-v-hartmarx-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span>, 403-405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990), and <i>Koon.</i> See <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 260, 125 S.Ct. 738.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Pierce,</i> we considered whether the District Court had properly awarded attorney's fees based on a determination that the Government's litigation position was not \"substantially justified\" within the meaning of the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d). Because the Act did not specify a standard of review, we found it necessary to rely on several \"significant relevant factors\" that persuaded us to apply an \"`abuse of discretion'\" standard. 487 U.S., at 559, 108 S.Ct. 2541. One factor was that a district judge was \"`better positioned'\" than an appellate judge to decide the issue. <i>Id.,</i> at 560, 108 S.Ct. 2541 (quoting <i>Miller v. Fenton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111542\"><a href=\"/opinion/111542/miller-v-fenton/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 114, 106 S.Ct. 445, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985)). We noted that a district court, through its participation in \"settlement conferences and other pretrial activities,\" \"may have insights not conveyed by the record, into such matters as whether particular evidence was worthy of being relied upon.\" 487 U.S., at 560, 108 S.Ct. 2541. We likewise noted that \"even where the district judge's full knowledge of the factual setting can be acquired by the appellate court, that acquisition will often come at unusual expense.\" <i>Ibid.</i> A second <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2472</span> factor that we found significant was the impracticability of formulating a rule of decision for an issue that may involve \"`multifarious, fleeting, special, narrow facts that utterly resist generalization.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 561-562, 108 S.Ct. 2541. In <i>Cooter &amp; Gell,</i> we held that both of these factors supported an \"abuse-of-discretion\" standard for review of a district judge's imposition of sanctions for violations of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See 496 U.S., at 403-405, 110 S.Ct. 2447. A third factor, the District Court's special knowledge about \"the local bar's litigation practices,\" also supported the abuse-of-discretion standard. <i>Id.,</i> at 404, 110 S.Ct. 2447. We further noted that \"[d]eference to the determination of courts on the front lines of litigation will enhance these courts' ability to control the litigants before them.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Recognizing that these factors bear equally upon a trial judge's sentencing decision, <i>Koon</i> expressly applied the principles of <i>Pierce</i> and <i>Cooter &amp; Gell</i> to the sentencing context. See <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S., at 99, 116 S.Ct. 2035. We adopted the same abuse-of-discretion standard, unanimously holding that a district court's decision to depart from the Guidelines \"will in most cases be due substantial deference, for it embodies the traditional exercise of discretion by a sentencing court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035. Echoing our earlier opinions, we added that \"[d]istrict courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts\" because they \"must make a refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome, informed by its vantage point and day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We also relied on the following statement in our opinion in <i>Williams v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112704\"><a href=\"/opinion/112704/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote>\"The development of the guideline sentencing regime has not changed our view that, except to the extent specifically directed by statute, `it is not the role of an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the sentencing court as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 205, 112 S.Ct. 1112 (quoting <i>Solem v. Helm,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111000\"><a href=\"/opinion/111000/solem-v-helm/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span>, 290, n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983)).</blockquote>\n<p>These basic considerations about the nature of sentencing have not changed in a post-<i>Booker</i> world. While the specific holding in <i>Koon</i> concerned only the scope of the trial judge's discretion on whether to depart from the Guidelines, now that the Guidelines are no longer mandatory, our reasoning applies with equal force to the sentencing judge's decision \"`as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence.'\" <i>Williams,</i> 503 U.S., at 205, 112 S.Ct. 1112. After <i>Booker,</i> appellate courts are now to assess a district court's exercise of discretion \"with regard to \u00a7 3553(a).\" 543 U.S., at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738. As we explained, \"Section 3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing. Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Guided by these \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <i>Booker's</i> abuse-of-discretion standard directs appellate courts to evaluate what motivated the District Judge's individualized sentencing decision. While reviewing courts may presume that a sentence within the advisory Guidelines is reasonable, appellate judges must still always defer to the sentencing judge's individualized sentencing determination. As we stated in <i>Koon,</i> \"[i]t has been uniform and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2473</span> and the punishment to ensue.\" 518 U.S., at 113, 116 S.Ct. 2035. The Commission has not developed any standards or recommendations that affect sentencing ranges for many individual characteristics. Matters such as age, education, mental or emotional condition, medical condition (including drug or alcohol addiction), employment history, lack of guidance as a youth, family ties, or military, civic, charitable, or public service are not ordinarily considered under the Guidelines. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a7 5H1.1-6, 11, and 12 (Nov.2006).<sup>[3]</sup> These are, however, matters that \u00a7 3553(a) authorizes the sentencing judge to consider. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). As such, they are factors that an appellate court must consider under <i>Booker's</i> abuse-of-discretion standard.</p>\n<p>My disagreement with Justice SCALIA and Justice SOUTER rests on the above understanding of <i>Booker's</i> standard of appellate review. I do not join Justice SCALIA's opinion because I believe that the purely procedural review he advocates is inconsistent with our remedial opinion in <i>Booker,</i> which plainly contemplated that reasonableness review would contain a substantive component. See 543 U.S., at 260-264, 125 S.Ct. 738. After all, a district judge who gives harsh sentences to Yankees fans and lenient sentences to Red Sox fans would not be acting reasonably even if her procedural rulings were impeccable. Moreover, even if some future unusually harsh sentence might violate the Sixth Amendment because it exceeds some yet-to-be-defined judicial standard of reasonableness, Justice SCALIA correctly acknowledges this case does not present such a problem. See <i>post,</i> at 2478 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"Nor is my claim that the Sixth Amendment was violated in this case, for petitioner cannot demonstrate that his relatively low sentence would have been unreasonable if the District Court had relied on nothing but jury-found or admitted facts\"); see also <i>ante,</i> at 2481-2482 (\"Justice SCALIA concedes that the Sixth Amendment concerns he foresees are not presented by this case. <i>Post,</i> at 2487-2488 (concurring in part and concurring in judgment). And his need to rely on <i>hypotheticals</i> to make his point is consistent with our view that the approach adopted here will not `raise a multitude of constitutional problems.' <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137741\"><a href=\"/opinion/137741/clark-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 380-381, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005)\"). Such a hypothetical case should be decided if and when it arises. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982).</p>\n<p>As to Justice SOUTER's opinion, I think he overestimates the \"gravitational pull\" towards the advisory Guidelines that will result from a presumption of reasonableness. <i>Post,</i> at 2487-2488 (dissenting opinion). <i>Booker's</i> standard of review allows\u0097indeed, requires\u0097district judges to consider <i>all</i> of the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and to apply them to the individual defendants before them. Appellate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2474</span> courts must then give deference to the sentencing decisions made by those judges, whether the resulting sentence is inside or outside the advisory Guidelines range, under traditional abuse-of-discretion principles. As the Court acknowledges, moreover, <i>presumptively</i> reasonable does not mean <i>always</i> reasonable; the presumption, of course, must be genuinely rebuttable. See <i>ante,</i> at 2462-2463. I am not blind to the fact that, as a practical matter, many federal judges continued to treat the Guidelines as virtually mandatory after our decision in <i>Booker.</i> See <i>post,</i> at 2478, n. 3 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). One well-respected federal judge has even written that, \"after watching this Court\u0097and the other Courts of Appeals, whether they have formally adopted such a presumption or not\u0097affirm hundreds upon hundreds of within-Guidelines sentences, it seems to me that the rebuttability of the presumption is more theoretical than real.\" <i>United States v. Pruitt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797915\"><a href=\"/opinion/797915/united-states-v-terri-pruitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1298</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1589409</span></span>, *11 (C.A.10 2007) (McConnell, J., concurring). Our decision today makes clear, however, that the rebuttability of the presumption is real. It should also be clear that appellate courts must review sentences individually and deferentially whether they are inside the Guidelines range (and thus potentially subject to a formal \"presumption\" of reasonableness) or outside that range. Given the clarity of our holding, I trust that those judges who had treated the Guidelines as virtually mandatory during the post-<i>Booker</i> interregnum will now recognize that the Guidelines are truly advisory.</p>\n<p>Applying this standard, I would affirm the sentence imposed by the District Court. Although I would have imposed a lower sentence had I been the District Judge, I agree that he did not abuse his discretion in making the particular decision that he did. I also agree with the Court that his decision is entitled to added respect because it was consistent with the advice in the Guidelines.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>That said, I do believe that there was a significant flaw in the sentencing procedure in this case. The petitioner is a veteran who received significant recognition for his service to his country. That aspect of his background is not taken into consideration in the sentencing guidelines and was not mentioned by the District Judge in his explanation of his choice of the sentence that defendant received. I regard this as a serious omission because I think the judge's statement to the defendant, made at the time of sentencing, is an especially important part of the criminal process. If the defendant is convinced that justice has been done in his case\u0097 that society has dealt with him fairly\u0097the likelihood of his successful rehabilitation will surely be enhanced. Nevertheless, given the importance of paying appropriate respect to the exercise of a sentencing judge's discretion, I join the Court's opinion and judgment.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>In <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"143790\"><a href=\"/opinion/143790/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), five Justices of this Court, I among them, held that our previous decision in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), applied to sentences imposed under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines because those Guidelines were mandatory and binding on judges. See 543 U.S., at 233-234, 243-244, 125 S.Ct. 738. We thus reaffirmed that \"[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2475</span> jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. In response to this constitutional holding, a different majority of five Justices held that the appropriate remedy was to make the Guidelines nonmandatory in all cases and to review sentences on appeal only for reasonableness. See <i>id.,</i> at 258-265, 125 S.Ct. 738. I disagreed with the Court's remedial choice, believing instead that the proper remedy was to maintain the mandatory character of the Guidelines and simply to require, for that small category of cases in which a fact was legally essential to the sentence imposed, that the fact be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the defendant. See <i>id.,</i> at 272-291, 125 S.Ct. 738 (STEVENS, J., joined by SCALIA and SOUTER, JJ., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>I do not mean to reopen that debate. As a matter of statutory <i>stare decisis,</i> I accept <i>Booker's</i> remedial holding that district courts are no longer bound by the Guidelines and that appellate courts should review the sentences imposed for reasonableness. As should be clear from our need to decide the case today, however, precisely what \"reasonableness\" review entails is not dictated by <i>Booker.</i> As I lamented then, \"[t]he worst feature of the scheme is that no one knows\u0097and perhaps no one is meant to know\u0097how advisory Guidelines and `unreasonableness' review will function in practice.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 311, 125 S.Ct. 738 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Earlier this Term, the Court intensified its silence when it declined to flesh out what it had in mind in the face of an argument that the form of reasonableness review had constitutional implications. In <i>Cunningham v. California,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007), Justice ALITO defended the constitutionality of California's sentencing system in part by arguing that, even post-<i>Booker,</i> some federal sentences will be upheld as reasonable only if the judge makes additional findings of fact beyond those encompassed by the jury verdict or guilty plea. 549 U.S., at ___, and n. 11, 127 S.Ct., at 867, and n. 11 (dissenting opinion). The <i>Cunningham</i> majority's response, much like the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion, was cryptic. While the Court did not explain <i>why</i> Justice ALITO was incorrect, it strongly intimated that his premise was wrong: that he had erroneously \"anticipate[d]\" how \"reasonableness review operates in practice.\" <i>Cunningham,</i> 549 U.S., at ___, n. 15, 127 S.Ct., at 870, n. 15. Because that question is squarely presented in this case that was then pending, the Court found it \"neither necessary nor proper ... to join issue with Justice ALITO on this matter,\" suggesting that all would be revealed in the opinion we issue today. See <i>id.,</i> at ___, n. 13, 127 S.Ct., at 868, n. 13.</p>\n<p>Today has arrived, and the Court has broken its promise. Nothing in the Court's opinion explains why, under the advisory Guidelines scheme, judge-found facts are <i>never</i> legally necessary to justify the sentence. By this I mean the Court has failed to establish that every sentence which will be imposed under the advisory Guidelines scheme could equally have been imposed had the judge relied upon no facts other than those found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. In fact, the Court implicitly, but quite plainly, acknowledges that this will not be the case, by treating as a permissible post-<i>Booker</i> claim petitioner's challenge of his within-Guidelines sentence as substantively excessive. See <i>ante,</i> at Part IV. Under the scheme promulgated today, some sentences reversed as excessive will be legally authorized in later cases only because additional judge-found facts are present; and, as Justice ALITO argued in <i>Cunningham,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2476</span> some lengthy sentences will be affirmed (<i>i.e.,</i> held lawful) only because of the presence of aggravating facts, not found by the jury, that distinguish the case from the mine-run. The Court does not even attempt to explain how this is consistent with the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>No explanation is given because no explanation is possible. The Court has reintroduced the constitutional defect that <i>Booker</i> purported to eliminate. I cannot acquiesce in this course. If a sentencing system is permissible in which some sentences cannot lawfully be imposed by a judge unless the judge finds certain facts by a preponderance of the evidence, then we should have left in place the compulsory Guidelines that Congress enacted, instead of imposing this jerry-rigged scheme of our own. In order to avoid the possibility of a Sixth Amendment violation, which was the object of the <i>Booker</i> remedy, district courts must be able, without finding any facts not embraced in the jury verdict or guilty plea, to sentence to the maximum of the <i>statutory</i> range. Because, therefore, appellate courts cannot reverse within-range sentences for being too high; and because no one would contend that Congress intended that sentences be reviewed only for being too low; I would hold that reasonableness review cannot contain a substantive component at all. I believe, however, that appellate courts can nevertheless secure some amount of sentencing uniformity through the procedural reasonableness review made possible by the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment requires that \"[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. Two hypotheticals will suffice to reveal why the notion of excessive sentences within the statutory range, and the ability of appellate courts to reverse such sentences, inexorably produces, in violation of the Sixth Amendment, sentences whose legality is premised on a judge's finding some fact (or combination of facts) by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p>First, consider two brothers with similar backgrounds and criminal histories who are convicted by a jury of respectively robbing two banks of an equal amount of money. Next assume that the district judge finds that one brother, fueled by racial animus, had targeted the first bank because it was owned and operated by minorities, whereas the other brother had selected the second bank simply because its location enabled a quick getaway. Further assume that the district judge imposes the statutory maximum upon both brothers, basing those sentences primarily upon his perception that bank robbery should be punished much more severely than the Guidelines base level advises, but explicitly noting that the racially biased decisionmaking of the first brother further justified his sentence. Now imagine that the appellate court reverses as excessive only the sentence of the nonracist brother. Given the dual holdings of the appellate court, the racist has a valid Sixth Amendment claim that his sentence was reasonable (and hence lawful) only because of the judicial finding of his motive in selecting his victim.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2477</span> Second, consider the common case in which the district court imposes a sentence <i>within</i> an advisory Guidelines range that has been substantially enhanced by certain judge-found facts. For example, the base offense level for robbery under the Guidelines is 20, United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B3.1(a) (Nov.2006), which, if the defendant has a criminal history of I, corresponds to an advisory range of 33-41 months, <i>id.,</i> ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. If, however, a judge finds that a firearm was discharged, that a victim incurred serious bodily injury, and that more than $5 million was stolen, then the base level jumps by 18, \u00a7\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2), (3), (7), producing an advisory range of 235-293 months, <i>id.,</i> ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. When a judge finds all of those facts to be true and then imposes a within-Guidelines sentence of 293 months, those judge-found facts, or some combination of them, are not merely facts that the judge finds relevant in exercising his discretion; they are the legally essential predicate for his imposition of the 293-month sentence. His failure to find them would render the 293-month sentence unlawful. That is evident because, were the district judge explicitly to find <i>none</i> of those facts true and nevertheless to impose a 293-month sentence (simply because he thinks robbery merits seven times the sentence that the Guidelines provide) the sentence would surely be reversed as unreasonably excessive.</p>\n<p>These hypotheticals are stylized ways of illustrating the basic problem with a system in which district courts lack full discretion to sentence within the statutory range. Under such a system, for every given crime there is some maximum sentence that will be upheld as reasonable based only on the facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. <i>Every</i> sentence higher than that is legally authorized only by some judge-found fact, in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Appellate courts' excessiveness review will explicitly or implicitly accept those judge-found facts as justifying sentences that would otherwise be unlawful. The only difference between this system and the pre-<i>Booker</i> mandatory Guidelines is that the maximum sentence based on the jury verdict or guilty plea was specified under the latter but must be established by appellate courts, in case-by-case fashion, under the former. This is, if anything, an additional constitutional disease, not a constitutional cure.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I am not suggesting that the Sixth Amendment prohibits judges from ever finding any facts. We have repeatedly affirmed the proposition that judges can find facts that help guide their discretion <i>within</i> the sentencing range that is authorized by the facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Booker, supra,</i> at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738; <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 481, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). But there is a fundamental difference, one underpinning our entire <i>Apprendi</i> jurisprudence, between facts that <i>must</i> be found in order for a sentence to be lawful, and facts that individual judges <i>choose</i> to make relevant to the exercise of their discretion. The former, but not the latter, must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in order \"to give intelligible content to the right of jury trial.\" <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 305, 124 S.Ct. 2531.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2478</span> I am also not contending that there is a Sixth Amendment problem with the Court's affirmation of a presumption of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentences. I agree with the Court that such a presumption never itself makes judge-found facts legally essential to the sentence imposed, since it has no direct relevance to whether the sentence would have been <i>unreasonable</i> in the <i>absence</i> of any judge-found facts. See <i>ante,</i> at 2465-2467.<sup>[3]</sup> Nor is my claim that the Sixth Amendment was violated in this case, for petitioner cannot demonstrate that his relatively low sentence would have been unreasonable if the District Court had relied on nothing but jury-found or admitted facts.</p>\n<p>Rather, my position is that there will inevitably be <i>some</i> constitutional violations under a system of substantive reasonableness review, because there will be some sentences that will be upheld as reasonable only because of the existence of judge-found facts. <i>Booker</i> itself reveals why that reality dooms the construct of reasonableness review established and applied by today's opinion. <i>Booker</i> made two things quite plain. First, reasonableness is the standard of review implicitly contained within the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984(SRA). 543 U.S., at 260-261, 125 S.Ct. 738. Second, Congress wanted a uniform system of sentencing review, rather than different schemes depending on whether there were Sixth Amendment problems in particular cases. <i>Id.,</i> at 265-267, 125 S.Ct. 738. Thus, if the contours of reasonableness review must be narrowed in <i>some</i> cases because of constitutional concerns, then they must be narrowed in <i>all</i> cases in light of Congress's desire for a uniform standard of review. The Justices composing today's Court were in total agreement with this principle of statutory interpretation the day <i>Booker</i> was decided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]hen deciding which of two plausible statutory constructions to adopt, a court must consider the necessary consequences of its choice. If one of them would raise a multitude of constitutional problems, the other should prevail\u0097 whether or not those constitutional problems pertain to the particular litigant before the Court.\" <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137741\"><a href=\"/opinion/137741/clark-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 380-381, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005) (opinion for the Court by SCALIA, J., joined by, <i>inter alios,</i> STEVENS, KENNEDY, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ.).</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2479</span> Yet they now adopt substantive reasonableness review without offering any rebuttal to my charge of patent constitutional flaw inherent in such review. The one comfort to be found in the Court's opinion\u0097though it does not excuse the failure to apply <i>Martinez's</i> interpretive principle\u0097is that it does not rule out as-applied Sixth Amendment challenges to sentences that would not have been upheld as reasonable on the facts encompassed by the jury verdict or guilty plea. <i>Ante,</i> at 2466-2467; <i>ante,</i> at 2473 (STEVENS, J., joined by GINSBURG, J., concurring).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Had the Court bothered to frame objections to the constitutional analysis undertaken above, there are four conceivable candidates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>The most simplistic objection is that the Sixth Amendment is not violated because the judge-found facts are made legally necessary by the decision of appellate courts rather than the decision of Congress. This rebuttal errs both in premise and in conclusion.</p>\n<p>The premise is wrong because, according to the remedial majority in <i>Booker,</i> the facts that excessiveness review renders legally essential are made such by Congress. Reasonableness is the standard of review <i>implicitly</i> contained within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). See <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 260-261, 125 S.Ct. 738. But the Sixth Amendment would be violated even if appellate courts really were exercising some type of common-law power to prescribe the facts legally necessary to support specific sentences. Neither <i>Apprendi</i> nor any of its progeny suggests that violation of the Sixth Amendment depends upon what branch of government has made the prescription. To the contrary, <i>Booker</i> flatly rejected the argument that the mandatory Guidelines were constitutional because it was the Sentencing Commission rather than Congress that specified the facts essential to punishment. See 543 U.S., at 237-239, 125 S.Ct. 738. And for good reason. The Sixth Amendment is \"a reservation of jury power.\" <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 308, 124 S.Ct. 2531. It makes no difference whether it is a legislature, a Sentencing Commission, or an appellate court that usurps the jury's prerogative. Were it otherwise, this Court could prescribe that the only reasonable sentences are those consistent with the same mandatory Guidelines that <i>Booker</i> invalidated. And the California Supreme Court could effectively reverse our decision in <i>Cunningham</i> simply by setting aside as unreasonable any trial-court sentence that does not conform to pre-<i>Cunningham</i> California law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>The next objection minimizes the extent to which excessiveness review makes judge-found facts legally essential to punishment. If appellate courts will uphold, based only on the facts found by the jury, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2480</span> a district court's decision to impose all but the lengthiest sentences, then the number of sentences that are legally dependent on judge-found facts will be quite small. Thus, the argument goes, there is no reason to prohibit substantive reasonableness review altogether: Absent a claim that such review creates a constitutional problem in a given case, why prohibit it? I have already explained why this line of defense is inconsistent with established principles of statutory interpretation. See <i>supra,</i> at 2462-2464. But even on its own terms, the defense is inconsistent with <i>Booker</i> because reasonableness review is an improper and inadequate remedial scheme unless it ensures that judge-found facts are <i>never</i> legally necessary to justify the sentence imposed under the advisory Guidelines.</p>\n<p>The mandatory Guidelines system that was invalidated in <i>Booker</i> had the same attribute of producing unconstitutional results in only a small proportion of cases. Because of guilty pleas and Guidelines ranges that did not depend on judge-found facts, the overwhelming majority of sentences imposed under the pre-<i>Booker</i> federal system were perfectly in accord with the Sixth Amendment. See <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 248, 125 S.Ct. 738; <i>id.,</i> at 275-277, 125 S.Ct. 738 (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). <i>Booker</i> nevertheless excised key statutory provisions governing federal sentencing, <i>in order to eliminate constitutional violations entirely.</i> If our conjured-up system does not accomplish that goal, then by what right have we supplanted the congressionally enacted mandatory Guidelines?</p>\n<p>If it is true that some sentences under today's Court-prescribed system will still violate the Sixth Amendment, nonetheless allowing the system to go forward will produce chaos. Most cases do not resemble my stylized hypotheticals, and ordinarily defendants and judges will be unable to figure out, based on a comparison of the facts in their case with the facts of all of the previously decided appellate cases, whether the sentence imposed would have been upheld as reasonable based only on the facts supporting the jury verdict or guilty plea. That will not stop defendants from making the argument, however, and the Court certainly has not foreclosed them from trying. See <i>supra,</i> at 2463-2464, and n. 4. Judges will have in theory two options: create complicated charts and databases, based on appellate precedents, to ascertain what facts are legally essential to justify what sentences; or turn a deaf ear to these claims, though knowing full well that some of them are justified. I bet on the latter.<sup>[5]</sup> Things were better under the mandatory Guidelines system, where every judge could readily identify when the Sixth Amendment was being violated, and could rule accordingly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Proponents of substantive reasonableness review could next argue that actual sentencing involves the consideration of dozens of different facts in order to make an individualized determination about each defendant. In the real world, they would contend, it is difficult, if not impossible, to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2481</span> determine whether any given fact was legally essential to the punishment imposed. But identifying the particular fatal fact is not necessary to identifying a constitutional violation. In the second hypothetical given above, for example, it is not possible to say which single fact, or which combination of facts, sufficed to bring the sentence within the bounds of the \"reasonable.\" But it <i>is</i> possible to say (indeed, it <i>must</i> be said) that <i>some</i> judge-found fact or combination of facts had that effect\u0097and that suffices to establish a Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n<blockquote>\"Whether the judge's authority to impose an enhanced sentence depends on finding a specified fact ..., one of several specified facts ..., or <i>any</i> aggravating fact ..., it remains the case that the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence. The judge acquires that authority only upon finding some additional fact.\" <i>Blakely,</i> supra, at 305, 124 S.Ct. 2531</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4</h2>\n<p>The last conceivable defense of the Guidelines-light would be to wrap them in the mantle of history and tradition.</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]hen a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down. Such a venerable and accepted tradition is not to be laid on the examining table and scrutinized for its conformity to some abstract principle of [constitutional] adjudication devised by this Court. To the contrary, such traditions are themselves the stuff out of which the Court's principles are to be formed.\" <i>Rutan v.

In the federal system, prior to the SRA, substantive appellate review of a district court's sentencing discretion essentially did not exist. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Dorszynski v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109093\"><a href=\"/opinion/109093/dorszynski-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 431, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 41 L.Ed.2d 855 (1974) (noting \"the general proposition that once it is determined that a sentence is within the limitations set forth in the statute under which it is imposed, appellate review is at an end\"); <i>id.,</i> at 443, 94 S.Ct. 3042 (\"[W]ell-established doctrine bars review of the exercise of sentencing discretion\"). As for state appellate review of sentences, as late as 1962, at least 39 States did not permit appellate courts to modify sentences imposed within the statutory limits. See Appellate Review of Sentences, A Symposium at the Judicial Conference of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></span>, 260 (1962). It would be an exaggeration to say that history reflects an established understanding that appellate review of excessive sentences conflicts with the Sixth Amendment. But it would also be an exaggeration to say that the historical pedigree of substantive appellate review of sentencing is so strong and clear as to overcome the basic principle underlying the jury-trial right applied by this Court in <i>Apprendi, Blakely, Booker,</i> and <i>Cunningham.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>A final defense of substantive reasonableness review would be to invoke the intent of Congress or of the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion. As for congressional intent: <i>Of course</i> Congress intended that judge-found facts be legally essential to the punishment imposed; that was the whole reason the mandatory Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment. If we are now to indulge a newfound respect for unconstitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2482</span> congressional intent, we should reimpose the mandatory Guidelines system. The quasi-Guidelines system the Court creates today manages to contravene <i>both</i> congressional intent <i>and</i> the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>As for the \"intent\" of the Booker remedial opinion: That opinion purported to be divining congressional intent <i>in light of what the Sixth Amendment compelled.</i> See 543 U.S., at 263-265, 125 S.Ct. 738. Absent some explanation of why substantive reasonableness review does not cause judge-found facts to justify greater punishment than the jury's verdict or the defendant's guilty plea would sustain, I fail to understand how such review could possibly have been intended by all five Justices who composed the <i>Booker</i> remedial majority. After all, at least one of them did not intend \"to override <i>Blakely,</i> and to render academic the entire first part of <i>Booker</i> itself,\" and has confirmed that \"[t]here would have been no majority in <i>Booker</i> for the revision of <i>Blakely</i> essayed in [Justice ALITO's <i>Cunningham</i>] dissent.\" <i>Cunningham,</i> 549 U.S., at ___, n. 15, 127 S.Ct., at 870, n. 15 (opinion for the Court by GINSBURG, J.).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Abandoning substantive reasonableness review does not require a return to the pre-SRA regime that the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion sought to avoid. See 543 U.S., at 263-265, 125 S.Ct. 738. As I said at the outset, I believe it is possible to give some effect to the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion and the purposes that it sought to serve while still avoiding the constitutional defect identified in the <i>Booker</i> merits opinion. Specifically, I would limit reasonableness review to the sentencing <i>procedures</i> mandated by statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>A central feature of the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion was its conclusion that the SRA was not completely inseverable. See <i>id.,</i> at 258-265, 125 S.Ct. 738. As a result, the Sentencing Commission \"remains in place, writing Guidelines, collecting information about actual district court sentencing decisions, undertaking research, and revising the Guidelines accordingly.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. Likewise, sentencing courts remain obligated to consider the various factors delineated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), including the nowadvisory Guidelines range. 543 U.S., at 259-260, 125 S.Ct. 738. And they are still instructed by that subsection to \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of [that] subsection.\" Significantly, \u00a7 3553(c) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) continues to require that district courts give reasons for their sentencing decisions, a requirement the requisite detail of which depends on whether the sentence is: (1) within the advisory Guidelines range; (2) within an advisory Guidelines range that spans more than 24 months; or (3) outside the advisory Guidelines range. These explanations, in turn, help the Commission revise the advisory Guidelines to reflect actual sentencing practices consistent with the statutory goals. See <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV)).</p>\n<p><i>Booker</i>'s retention of these statutory procedural provisions furthered the congressional purpose of \"iron[ing] out sentencing differences,\" 543 U.S., at 263, 125 S.Ct. 738, and \"avoid[ing] excessive sentencing disparities,\" <i>id.,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. It is important that appellate courts police their observance. <i>Booker</i> excised the provision of the SRA containing the standards for appellate review, see <i>id.,</i> at 260, 125 S.Ct. 738 (invalidating 18 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2483</span> \u00a7 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV)), but the remedial majority's creation of reasonableness review gave appellate courts the necessary means to reverse a district court that: appears not to have considered \u00a7 3553(a); considers impermissible factors; selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts; or does not comply with \u00a7 3553(c)'s requirement for a statement of reasons.<sup>[6]</sup> In addition to its direct effect on sentencing uniformity, this procedural review will indirectly produce, over time, reduction of sentencing disparities. By ensuring that district courts give reasons for their sentences, and more specific reasons when they decline to follow the advisory Guidelines range, see \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), appellate courts will enable the Sentencing Commission to perform its function of revising the Guidelines to reflect the desirable sentencing practices of the district courts. See <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV)). And as that occurs, district courts will have less reason to depart from the Commission's recommendations, leading to more sentencing uniformity.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>One possible objection to procedural review that the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion appears not to have considered is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(f) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which limits appellate courts to reversing sentences that are imposed \"in violation of law\" or \"as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines,\" \u00a7 3742(f)(1), or that fall in certain categories and are either \"too high\" or \"too low,\" \u00a7 3742(f)(2).<sup>[8]</sup> But, as I noted in <i>Booker,</i> \u00a7 3742(e) and \u00a7 3742(f) are inextricably intertwined: Having excised \u00a7 3742(e)'s provisions setting forth the standards for appellate review, it is nonsensical to continue to apply \u00a7 3742(f)'s provisions governing the \"Decision and Disposition\" of appeals, which clearly track those now-excised standards. See 543 U.S., at 306-307, 125 S.Ct. 738 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part). I would hold that \u00a7 3742(f) is \"incapable of functioning independently\" of the provisions excised in <i>Booker,</i> and is thus inseverable from them. See <i>Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111847\"><a href=\"/opinion/111847/alaska-airlines-inc-v-brock/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span>, 684, 107 S.Ct. 1476, 94 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2484</span> L.Ed.2d 661 (1987); 2 N.

I join Part III of the Court's opinion. See <i>ante,</i> at 2468-2469.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Court's decision today leaves unexplained why the mandatory Guidelines were unconstitutional, but the Court-created substantive-review system that contains the same potential for Sixth Amendment violation is not. It is irresponsible to leave this patent inconsistency hanging in the air, threatening in the future yet another major revision of Guidelines practices to which the district courts and courts of appeals will have to adjust. Procedural review would lay the matter to rest, comporting with both parts of the <i>Booker</i> opinion and achieving the maximum degree of sentencing uniformity on the basis of judge-found facts that the Constitution permits.</p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Applying the Sixth Amendment to current sentencing law has gotten complicated, and someone coming cold to this case might wonder how we reached this point. A very general overview of the course of decisions over the past eight years may help to put today's holding in perspective.</p>\n<p>Members of a criminal jury are guaranteed to be impartial residents of the State and district of the crime, but the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury otherwise relies on history for details, and the practical instincts of judges and legislators for implementation in the courts. Litigation has, for example, worked through issues of size, see <i>Ballew v. Georgia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109814\"><a href=\"/opinion/109814/ballew-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. 1029, 55 L.Ed.2d 234 (1978) (prohibiting five-person state juries but allowing juries of six), and unanimity, see <i>Apodaca v. Oregon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108539\"><a href=\"/opinion/108539/apodaca-v-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span>, 92 S.Ct. 1628, 32 L.Ed.2d 184 (1972) (allowing nonunanimous juries in state criminal trials); <i>Burch v. Louisiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110057\"><a href=\"/opinion/110057/burch-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, 99 S.Ct. 1623, 60 L.Ed.2d 96 (1979) (prohibiting nonunanimous six-person juries). Such decisions go to what William James would have called the \"cash-value\" of the Constitution's guarantee. See W. James, Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking 200 (1st ed.1907).</p>\n<p>One additional issue of both detail and implementation is the line between judge and jury in determining facts, and in particular the legitimate extent of factfinding by a judge when sentencing a defendant after a guilty plea or a jury's verdict of guilty. Since the very inception of judicial discretion in determining a sentence, judges have acted on what they learn in the course of a trial (and later what they gather from a presentence report or other evidence at time of sentencing), including details a trial jury may not have found to be true when it returned the guilty verdict or answered a special question. But historically, also, the customary judicial use of these extraverdict facts has been in deciding on a sentence within a range set in advance by the statute defining the crime in question. See <i>Williams v. New York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104681\"><a href=\"/opinion/104681/williams-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 246-247, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). Thus, traditionally when a judge imposed a sentence at some point in the range, say, of 0-to-5 years specified by statute for some offense, every fact necessary to go as high as five <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2485</span> years had been found by the jury (or admitted), even though the jury had not made particular or implicit findings of the facts the judge might consider in exercising discretion to set the sentence higher or lower within the 5-year range.</p>\n<p>It was against this background, in <i>Jones v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), that we called attention to a serious threat to the practical value of a criminal defendant's jury right. Jones had been prosecuted under a statute that exemplified a growing practice of providing a definition and penalty for some basic crime subject to the right of jury trial, but then identifying variants carrying higher ranges of penalties depending on facts that arguably might be found by a judge sitting alone. Thus, Jones was convicted solely of carjacking, but if the further fact of causing \"`serious bodily injury'\" was shown, the maximum penalty jumped from 15 years to 25. <i>Id.,</i> at 230, 119 S.Ct. 1215 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 (1988 ed., Supp. V)). The Government's position was that the extra fact of serious bodily injury raising the penalty range required no jury finding because it was only a condition for imposing an enhanced sentence, up to a judge, not an element of a more serious crime, subject to the right to a jury's determination. See <i>Jones,</i> 526 U.S., at 233, 119 S.Ct. 1215.</p>\n<p>It was an unsettling argument, because in prosecutions under these statutory schemes the most serious issue in the case might well be not guilt or innocence of the basic offense, but liability to the substantially enhanced penalty. If, for example, the judge found that Jones had caused not just serious bodily injury, but death, such extraverdict factfinding could have made the difference between 15 years and life imprisonment. <i>Id.,</i> at 230, 119 S.Ct. 1215 (quoting \u00a7 2119 (1988 ed., Supp. V)). In a case like that, giving judges the exclusive power to find the facts necessary to sentence in the higher range would make the jury a mere gatekeeper to the more important trial before a judge alone. <i>Id.,</i> at 243-244, 119 S.Ct. 1215. The Sixth Amendment does not, of course, speak expressly to such a scheme, but that is not a sufficient reason to give it constitutional approval. For if judicial factfinding necessary for an enhanced sentencing range were held to be adequate in the face of a defendant's objection, a defendant's right to have a jury standing between himself and the power of the government to curtail his liberty would take on a previously unsuspected modesty.</p>\n<p><i>Jones</i> accordingly treated this practice as suspect enough to call for applying the doctrine of constitutional avoidance when the Court interpreted the statute in question. What the Government called a mere condition for imposing a sentencing enhancement was treated as an element of a more serious offense and made subject to a jury's factfinding. This interpretation obviated the constitutional decision whether subjecting an unwilling defendant to a more onerous range of sentence on facts found solely by a judge would violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The issue did not go away with <i>Jones,</i> and the constitutional challenge was soon presented inescapably, in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We held that exposing a defendant to an increased penalty beyond the range for a basic crime, based on facts determined exclusively by a judge, violated the Sixth Amendment, in the absence of a jury waiver; a defendant could not be subjected to a penalty more serious than one authorized by the facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2486</span> <i>Id.,</i> at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.<sup>[1]</sup> A judge could constitutionally determine facts for exercising discretion in sentencing up to that point, but a fact that raised the range of possible penalties functioned like an element of a more serious offense, even if a statute ostensibly tied that fact to the sentence alone. Hence, in the absence of waiver, a sentence in that weightier range could be imposed by a judge only if the enhancing fact was found beyond a reasonable doubt by the trial jury. <i>Ibid.</i> In placing disputed factfinding off judicial limits when, but only when, its effect would be to raise the range of possible sentences, we made a practical judgment that maintained the historical judicial role in finding facts relevant to sentencing within the range set by a jury's verdict, but we recognized that the jury right would be trivialized beyond recognition if that traditional practice could be extended to the point that a judge alone (over objection) could find a fact necessary to raise the upper limit of a sentencing range.</p>\n<p>From the moment <i>Apprendi</i> drew that line, however, its holding carried apparent implications for the regime of Guidelines sentencing adopted in 1984, see Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat.1987, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). The general object of Guidelines sentencing was the eminently laudable one of promoting substantial consistency in exercising judicial discretion to sentence within the range set by statute for a given crime. Thus, at the elementary level, the Guidelines law limits the sentence that a judge may impose even within the sentencing range provided by the statute creating a particular offense. In effect, it divides a basic sentencing range into subranges and assigns an offender to a subrange based on the particular facts of the case and the offender's criminal history. A judge may depart from the assigned subrange only if the case presents a circumstance \"not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). It follows that a judge must find facts beyond those necessary for the jury's guilty verdict to sentence above (or below, for that matter) the subrange designated for an offender with a comparable criminal history whose case presents no relevant facts beyond the formal elements of the crime itself. The result is a hybrid sentencing practice. One could describe it by emphasizing that the judge's factfinding could never increase the sentence beyond the range set by the law defining the crime, or one could stress that a principal motivation for Guidelines sentencing is eliminating some traditional judicial discretion by forbidding a judge to impose a high sentence except on the basis of some fact beyond those necessary for a guilty verdict (and thus subject to the right to a jury's determination).</p>\n<p>In <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), considering a state sentencing system similar to the federal scheme, we decided that the latter way of looking at it made more sense, if <i>Apprendi</i> was going to mean something in preserving the historical significance of the jury. See 542 U.S., at 305-306, 124 S.Ct. 2531. We held that the additional factfinding necessary for a judge to sentence within a high subrange was comparable to the finding of additional fact required for a judge to impose an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2487</span> enhanced sentence under the law considered in <i>Apprendi.</i> If <i>Blakely</i> had come out the other way, the significance of <i>Apprendi</i> itself would be in jeopardy: a legislature would be free to bypass <i>Apprendi</i> by providing an abnormally spacious sentencing range for any basic crime (theoretically exposing a defendant to the highest sentence just by the jury's guilty verdict), then leaving it to a judge to make supplementary findings not only appropriate but necessary for a sentence in a subrange at the high end. That would spell the end of <i>Apprendi</i> and diminish the real significance of jury protection that <i>Apprendi</i> had shored up.</p>\n<p>In <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"143790\"><a href=\"/opinion/143790/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a majority of the Court applied <i>Blakely</i>'s reasoning and held that the Federal Guidelines, too, subjected defendants to unconstitutional sentences in upper subranges, absent a jury finding or waiver. So far, so good for the Sixth Amendment, but there was the further issue of remedy, and at that step consistency began to falter. If statutory Guidelines were to survive, there were two serious alternatives. One was already in place in courts with the foresight to apply <i>Apprendi</i> to the Guidelines: require any additional facts necessary for a possible high subrange sentence to be charged and submitted to the jury. True, the Government would have to think ahead (and could not charge relevant facts that emerged unexpectedly at trial). But the mandatory character of the Guidelines would be preserved, the goal of consistency would continue to be served, and the practical value of the jury right would not face erosion.</p>\n<p>The second remedial alternative was a declaration by the Court that the Guidelines were not mandatory but discretionary, so that finding extraverdict facts was not strictly necessary for sentencing in a high subrange under the Guidelines. On this alternative, a judge who found a subsidiary fact specified as a condition for a high subrange sentence might decide to impose a low sentence (independently of the Guidelines' own provisions for downward departure), and a judge who found no such fact might sentence within the high subrange for other reasons that seemed sufficient. If the Guidelines were not mandatory, the subsidiary fact merely provided one reasoned basis for a traditional exercise of discretion to sentence at the high end of the sentencing range provided by the statute defining the crime.</p>\n<p>But that second alternative could not be so simple: it raised yet further issues, and the reconfigured majority of the Court that in fact adopted it, see 543 U.S., at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, guaranteed that we would have the case now before us. If district judges treated the now-discretionary Guidelines simply as worthy of consideration but open to rejection in any given case, the <i>Booker</i> remedy would threaten a return to the old sentencing regime and would presumably produce the apparent disuniformity that convinced Congress to adopt Guidelines sentencing in the first place. But if sentencing judges attributed substantial gravitational pull to the now-discretionary Guidelines, if they treated the Guidelines result as persuasive or presumptively appropriate, the <i>Booker</i> remedy would in practical terms preserve the very feature of the Guidelines that threatened to trivialize the jury right. For a presumption of Guidelines reasonableness would tend to produce Guidelines sentences almost as regularly as mandatory Guidelines had done, with judges finding the facts needed for a sentence in an upper subrange. This would open the door to undermining <i>Apprendi</i> itself, and this is what has happened today.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2488</span> Without a powerful reason to risk reversal on the sentence, a district judge faced with evidence supporting a high subrange Guidelines sentence will do the appropriate factfinding in disparagement of the jury right and will sentence within the high subrange. This prediction is weakened not a whit by the Court's description of within-Guidelines reasonableness as an \"appellate\" presumption, <i>ante,</i> at 2464-2465 (emphasis deleted). What works on appeal determines what works at trial, and if the Sentencing Commission's views are as weighty as the Court says they are, see <i>ante,</i> at 2463-2465, a trial judge will find it far easier to make the appropriate findings and sentence within the appropriate Guideline, than to go through the unorthodox factfinding necessary to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The upshot is that today's decision moves the threat to the practical value of the Sixth Amendment jury right closer to what it was when this Court flagged it in <i>Jones,</i> and it seems fair to ask just what has been accomplished in real terms by all the judicial labor imposed by <i>Apprendi</i> and its associated cases.</p>\n<p>Taking the <i>Booker</i> remedy (of discretionary Guidelines) as a given, however, the way to avoid further risk to <i>Apprendi</i> and the jury right is to hold that a discretionary within-Guidelines sentence carries no presumption of reasonableness. Only if sentencing decisions are reviewed according to the same standard of reasonableness whether or not they fall within the Guidelines range will district courts be assured that the entire sentencing range set by statute is available to them. See <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 263, 125 S.Ct. 738 (calling for a reasonableness standard \"across the board\"). And only then will they stop replicating the unconstitutional system by imposing appeal-proof sentences within the Guidelines ranges determined by facts found by them alone.</p>\n<p>I would therefore reject the presumption of reasonableness adopted in this case, not because it is pernicious in and of itself, but because I do not think we can recognize such a presumption and still retain the full effect of <i>Apprendi</i> in aid of the Sixth Amendment guarantee. But I would not stop at rejecting the presumption. Neither my preferred course nor the choice of today's majority can avoid being at odds to some degree with the intent of Congress; there is no question that Congress meant to impose mandatory Guidelines as the means of bringing greater uniformity to sentencing. So I point out that the congressional objective can still be attained, but that <i>Booker's</i> remedial holding means that only Congress can restore the scheme to what it had in mind, and in a way that gives full measure to the right to a jury trial. If Congress has not had a change of heart about the value of a Guidelines system, it can reenact the Guidelines law to give it the same binding force it originally had, but with provision for jury, not judicial, determination of any fact necessary for a sentence within an upper Guidelines subrange. At this point, only Congress can make good on both its enacted policy of mandatory Guidelines sentencing and the guarantee of a robust right of jury trial.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  See 543 U.S., at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738 (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.) (\"We have never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range. Indeed, everyone agrees that the constitutional issues presented by these cases would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the [Sentencing Reform Act of 1984] the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges\" (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>[2]  In fact, <i>Booker</i> expressly equated the new \"reasonableness\" standard with the old abuse-of-discretion standard used to review sentencing departures. See <i>id.,</i> at 262, 125 S.Ct. 738 (\"`Reasonableness' standards are not foreign to sentencing law. The Act has long required their use in important sentencing circumstances\u0097both <i>on review of departures,</i> see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(3) (1994 ed.), and on review of sentences imposed where there was no applicable Guideline, see \u00a7\u00a7 3742(a)(4), (b)(4), (e)(4)\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>[3]  See also Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Key Compromises Upon Which They Rest, 17 Hofstra L.Rev. 1, 19-20 (1988) (\"The Commission extensively debated which offender characteristics should make a difference in sentencing; that is, which characteristics were important enough to warrant formal reflection within the Guidelines and which should constitute possible grounds for departure .... Eventually, in light of the arguments based in part on considerations of fairness and in part on the uncertainty as to how a sentencing judge would actually account for the aggravating and/or mitigating factors ... the current offender characteristics rules look primarily to past records of convictions\" (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p>[1]  Of course, it may be that some fact other than racial animus would also have sufficed to sustain the increased sentence. But it is undeniable that in the case at hand the judicial finding of racial animus filled that role. See <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 305, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p>[2]  For similar reasons, I recognize that the Sixth Amendment problem with reasonableness review is created only by the lack of district court discretion to impose <i>high</i> sentences, since eliminating discretion to impose <i>low</i> sentences is the equivalent of judicially creating mandatory minimums, which are not a concern of the Sixth Amendment. See <i>Harris v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, 568-569, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). But since reasonableness review should not function as a one-way ratchet, <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"143790\"><a href=\"/opinion/143790/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 257-258, 266, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we must forswear the notion that sentences can be too low in light of the need to abandon the concept that sentences can be too high.</p>\n<p>[3]  For this reason, I do not join Justice SOUTER's dissent. He wishes to give \"district courts [assurance] that the entire sentencing range set by statute is available to them.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2488. That is a proper goal\u0097indeed, an essential one to prevent the <i>Booker</i> remedy from effectively overturning <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Blakely.</i> But eliminating the presumption of reasonableness will not achieve it. In those Circuits that <i>already</i> decline to employ the presumption, a within-Guidelines sentence has <i>never</i> been reversed as substantively excessive, Brief for New York Council of Defense Lawyers as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 5, refuting the belief that mere elimination of the presumption will destroy the \"gravitational pull,\" <i>post,</i> at 2487 (SOUTER, J., dissenting), to stay safely within the Guidelines. The only way to assure district courts that they can deviate from the advisory Guidelines, and to ensure that judge-found facts are never legally essential to the sentence, is to prohibit appellate courts from reviewing the <i>substantive</i> sentencing choices made by district courts.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Court suggests that my reliance on hypotheticals indicates that its interpretation of reasonableness will not create a multitude of constitutional problems. <i>Ante,</i> at 2466; see also <i>ante,</i> at 2473 (STEVENS, J., concurring). Setting aside the question whether the volume of constitutional violations has any relevance to the application of <i>Martinez's</i> interpretive principle, the Court is wrong to think that the constitutional problem today's opinion ignores is hypothetical, merely because I have used hypotheticals to describe it. It is all too real that advisory Guidelines sentences routinely change months and years of imprisonment to decades and centuries on the basis of judge-found facts\u0097as <i>Booker</i> itself recognized, see 543 U.S., at 236-237, 125 S.Ct. 738 (citing, <i>inter alia,</i> a case in which a defendant's sentence increased from 57 months to 155 years).</p>\n<p>[5]  Perhaps I am too cynical. At least one conscientious District Judge has decided to shoulder the burden of ascertaining what the maximum reasonable sentence is in each case based only on the verdict and appellate precedent, correctly concluding that this is the <i>only</i> way to eliminate Sixth Amendment problems after <i>Cunningham</i> if <i>Booker</i> mandates substantive reasonableness review. See <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> No. 05-10175-WGY, ___ F.Supp.2d ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1800465\"><a href=\"/opinion/1800465/state-v-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1620526</span></a></span>, *13-*14 (D.Mass., June 6, 2007) (Young, D.J.) (Sentencing Memorandum).</p>\n<p>[6]  \"Substance\" and \"procedure\" are admittedly chameleon-like terms. See <i>Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112102\"><a href=\"/opinion/112102/sun-oil-co-v-wortman/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 726-727, 108 S.Ct. 2117, 100 L.Ed.2d 743 (1988). As the text indicates, my use of the term \"procedure\" here includes the limiting of sentencing factors to permissible ones\u0097as opposed to using permissible factors but reaching a result that is \"substantively\" wrong. I therefore disagree with Justice STEVENS that a district court which discriminates against Yankees fans is acting in a procedurally \"impeccable\" way. <i>Ante,</i> at 2473 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p>[7]  Courts must resist, however, the temptation to make procedural review more stringent because substantive review is off the table. The judicial role when conducting severability analysis is limited to determining whether the balance of a statute that contains an unconstitutional provision is capable \"of functioning independently.\" <i>Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111847\"><a href=\"/opinion/111847/alaska-airlines-inc-v-brock/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span>, 684, 107 S.Ct. 1476, 94 L.Ed.2d 661 (1987). Courts have no power to add provisions that might be desirable now that certain provisions have been excised. Thus, when engaging in reasonableness review to determine whether the district court has complied with the various procedures in \u00a7 3553, an appellate court cannot subject the district court to any greater requirements than existed pre-<i>Booker.</i></p>\n<p>[8]  I say \"possible\" because one could claim that the failure to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553's procedural requirements results in a sentence imposed in violation of law, and thereby covered by \u00a7 3742(f)(1). But \u00a7 3742(f)(1)'s applicability to such procedural errors is called into question by \u00a7 3742(f)(2), which specifically addresses sentences where \"the district court failed to provide the required statement of reasons [mandated by \u00a7 3553(c)(2)].\" For the reasons specified in the text, however, I see no need to grapple, post-<i>Booker,</i> with the proper interpretation of \u00a7 3742(f).</p>\n<p>[1]  We recognized a single exception to this rule, permitting reliance on the fact of a prior conviction without a jury determination that the defendant had previously been convicted. See <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S., at 489-490, 120 S.Ct. 2348; see also <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p>[2]  Because I would ask the Court of Appeals to review the sentence for reasonableness without resort to any presumption, I would not reach the other issues in this case.</p>\n\n</div>",
