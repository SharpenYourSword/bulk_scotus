Congress, Richard H. Weiss, Counsel of Record, Clifford S. Goodstein, Milberg Weiss &amp; Bershad LLP, New York, NY, for Respondents.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This Court has long recognized that meritorious private actions to enforce federal antifraud securities laws are an essential supplement to criminal prosecutions and civil enforcement actions brought, respectively, by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo,</i> 544 U.S. 336, 345, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005); <i>J.I. Case Co. v. Borak,</i> 377 U.S. 426, 432, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964). Private securities fraud actions, however, if not adequately contained, can be employed abusively to impose substantial costs on companies and individuals whose conduct conforms to the law. See <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v. Dabit,</i> 547 U.S. 71, 81, 126 S.Ct. 1503, 164 L.Ed.2d 179 (2006). As a check against abusive litigation by private parties, Congress enacted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 109 Stat. 737.</p>\n<p>Exacting pleading requirements are among the control measures Congress included in the PSLRA. The Act requires plaintiffs to state with particularity both the facts constituting the alleged violation, and the facts evidencing scienter, <i>i.e.,</i> the defendant's intention \"to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</i> 425 U.S. 185, 194, and n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976); see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(1),(2). This case concerns the latter requirement. As set out in \u00a7 21D(b)(2) of the PSLRA, plaintiffs must \"state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2).</p>\n<p>Congress left the key term \"strong inference\" undefined, and Courts of Appeals have divided on its meaning. In the case before us, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the \"strong inference\" standard would be met if the complaint \"allege[d] facts from which, if true, a reasonable person could infer that the defendant acted with the required intent.\" 437 F.3d 588, 602 (2006). That formulation, we conclude, does not capture the stricter demand Congress sought to convey in \u00a7 21D(b)(2). It does not suffice that a reasonable factfinder plausibly could infer from the complaint's allegations the requisite state of mind. Rather, to determine whether a complaint's scienter allegations can survive threshold inspection for sufficiency, a court governed by \u00a7 21D(b)(2) must engage in a comparative evaluation; it must consider, not only inferences urged by the plaintiff, as the Seventh Circuit did, but also competing inferences rationally drawn from the facts alleged. An inference of fraudulent intent may be plausible, yet less cogent than other, nonculpable explanations for the defendant's conduct. To qualify as \"strong\" within the intendment of \u00a7 21D(b)(2), we hold, an inference of scienter must be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2505</span> more than merely plausible or reasonable\u0097 it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Tellabs, Inc., manufactures specialized equipment used in fiber optic networks. During the time period relevant to this case, petitioner Richard Notebaert was Tellabs' chief executive officer and president. Respondents (Shareholders) are persons who purchased Tellabs stock between December 11, 2000, and June 19, 2001. They accuse Tellabs and Notebaert (as well as several other Tellabs executives) of engaging in a scheme to deceive the investing public about the true value of Tellabs' stock. See 437 F.3d, at 591; App. 94-98.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Beginning on December 11, 2000, the Shareholders allege, Notebaert (and by imputation Tellabs) \"falsely reassured public investors, in a series of statements ... that Tellabs was continuing to enjoy strong demand for its products and earning record revenues,\" when, in fact, Notebaert knew the opposite was true. <i>Id.,</i> at 94-95, 98. From December 2000 until the spring of 2001, the Shareholders claim, Notebaert knowingly misled the public in four ways. 437 F.3d, at 596. First, he made statements indicating that demand for Tellabs' flagship networking device, the TITAN 5500, was continuing to grow, when in fact demand for that product was waning. <i>Id.,</i> at 596, 597. Second, Notebaert made statements indicating that the TITAN 6500, Tellabs' next-generation networking device, was available for delivery, and that demand for that product was strong and growing, when in truth the product was not ready for delivery and demand was weak. <i>Id.,</i> at 596, 597-598. Third, he falsely represented Tellabs' financial results for the fourth quarter of 2000 (and, in connection with those results, condoned the practice of \"channel stuffing,\" under which Tellabs flooded its customers with unwanted products). <i>Id.,</i> at 596, 598. Fourth, Notebaert made a series of overstated revenue projections, when demand for the TITAN 5500 was drying up and production of the TITAN 6500 was behind schedule. <i>Id.,</i> at 596, 598-599. Based on Notebaert's sunny assessments, the Shareholders contend, market analysts recommended that investors buy Tellabs' stock. See <i>id.,</i> at 592.</p>\n<p>The first public glimmer that business was not so healthy came in March 2001 when Tellabs modestly reduced its first quarter sales projections. <i>Ibid.</i> In the next months, Tellabs made progressively more cautious statements about its projected sales. On June 19, 2001, the last day of the class period, Tellabs disclosed that demand for the TITAN 5500 had significantly dropped. <i>Id.,</i> at 593. Simultaneously, the company substantially lowered its revenue projections for the second quarter of 2001. The next day, the price of Tellabs stock, which had reached a high of $67 during the period, plunged to a low of $15.87. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>On December 3, 2002, the Shareholders filed a class action in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. <i>Ibid.</i> Their complaint stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that Tellabs and Notebaert had engaged in securities fraud in violation of \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2506</span> 891, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5 (2006), also that Notebaert was a \"controlling person\" under \u00a7 20(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), and therefore derivatively liable for the company's fraudulent acts. See App. 98-101, 167-171. Tellabs moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Shareholders had failed to plead their case with the particularity the PSLRA requires. The District Court agreed, and therefore dismissed the complaint without prejudice. App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a-117a; see <i>Johnson v. Tellabs, Inc.,</i> 303 F.Supp.2d 941, 945 (N.D.Ill.2004).</p>\n<p>The Shareholders then amended their complaint, adding references to 27 confidential sources and making further, more specific, allegations concerning Notebaert's mental state. See 437 F.3d, at 594; App. 91-93, 152-160. The District Court again dismissed, this time with prejudice. 303 F.Supp.2d, at 971. The Shareholders had sufficiently pleaded that Notebaert's statements were misleading, the court determined, <i>id.,</i> at 955-961, but they had insufficiently alleged that he acted with scienter, <i>id.,</i> at 954-955, 961-969.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed in relevant part. 437 F.3d, at 591. Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals found that the Shareholders had pleaded the misleading character of Notebaert's statements with sufficient particularity. <i>Id.,</i> at 595-600. Unlike the District Court, however, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the Shareholders had sufficiently alleged that Notebaert acted with the requisite state of mind. <i>Id.,</i> at 603-605.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals recognized that the PSLRA \"unequivocally raise[d] the bar for pleading scienter\" by requiring plaintiffs to \"plea[d] sufficient facts to create a strong inference of scienter.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 601 (internal quotation marks omitted). In evaluating whether that pleading standard is met, the Seventh Circuit said, \"courts [should] examine all of the allegations in the complaint and then ... decide whether collectively they establish such an inference.\" <i>Ibid.</i> \"[W]e will allow the complaint to survive,\" the court next and critically stated, \"if it alleges facts from which, if true, a reasonable person could infer that the defendant acted with the required intent .... If a reasonable person could not draw such an inference from the alleged facts, the defendants are entitled to dismissal.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 602.</p>\n<p>In adopting its standard for the survival of a complaint, the Seventh Circuit explicitly rejected a stiffer standard adopted by the Sixth Circuit, <i>i.e.,</i> that \"plaintiffs are entitled only to the most plausible of competing inferences.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 601, 602 (quoting <i>Fidel v. Farley,</i> 392 F.3d 220, 227 (C.A.6 2004)). The Sixth Circuit's standard, the court observed, because it involved an assessment of competing inferences, \"could potentially infringe upon plaintiffs' Seventh Amendment rights.\" 437 F.3d, at 602. We granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement among the Circuits on whether, and to what extent, a court must consider competing inferences in determining whether a securities fraud complaint gives rise to a \"strong inference\" of scienter.<sup>[2]</sup> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 853, 166 L.Ed.2d 681 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2507</span> II</h2>\n<p>Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 forbids the \"use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security ..., [of] any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b). SEC Rule 10b-5 implements \u00a7 10(b) by declaring it unlawful:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made ... not misleading, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\" 17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5.</blockquote>\n<p>Section 10(b), this Court has implied from the statute's text and purpose, affords a right of action to purchasers or sellers of securities injured by its violation. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Dura Pharmaceuticals,</i> 544 U.S., at 341, 125 S.Ct. 1627. See also <i>id.,</i> at 345, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (\"The securities statutes seek to maintain public confidence in the marketplace .... by deterring fraud, in part, through the availability of private securities fraud actions.\"); <i>Borak,</i> 377 U.S., at 432, 84 S.Ct. 1555 (private securities fraud actions provide \"a most effective weapon in the enforcement\" of securities laws and are \"a necessary supplement to Commission action\"). To establish liability under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a private plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with scienter, \"a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst,</i> 425 U.S., at 193-194, and n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In an ordinary civil action, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require only \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2). Although the rule encourages brevity, the complaint must say enough to give the defendant \"fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\" <i>Dura Pharmaceuticals,</i> 544 U.S., at 346, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (internal quotation marks omitted). Prior to the enactment of the PSLRA, the sufficiency of a complaint for securities fraud was governed not by Rule 8, but by the heightened pleading standard set forth in Rule 9(b). See <i>Greenstone v. Cambex Corp.,</i> 975 F.2d 22, 25 (C.A.1 1992) (Breyer, J.) (collecting cases). Rule 9(b) applies to \"all averments of fraud or mistake\"; it requires that \"the circumstances constituting fraud ... be stated with particularity\" but provides that \"[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person, may be averred generally.\"</p>\n<p>Courts of Appeals diverged on the character of the Rule 9(b) inquiry in \u00a7 10(b) cases: Could securities fraud plaintiffs allege the requisite mental state \"simply by stating that scienter existed,\" <i>In re GlenFed, Inc. Securities Litigation,</i> 42 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2508</span> 1541, 1546-1547 (C.A.9 1994) (en banc), or were they required to allege with particularity facts giving rise to an inference of scienter? Compare <i>id.,</i> at 1546 (\"We are not permitted to add new requirements to Rule 9(b) simply because we like the effects of doing so.\"), with, <i>e.g., </i><i>Greenstone,</i> 975 F.2d, at 25 (were the law to permit a securities fraud complaint simply to allege scienter without supporting facts, \"a complaint could evade too easily the `particularity' requirement in Rule 9(b)'s first sentence\"). Circuits requiring plaintiffs to allege specific facts indicating scienter expressed that requirement variously. See 5A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1301.1, pp. 300-302 (3d ed.2004) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller). The Second Circuit's formulation was the most stringent. Securities fraud plaintiffs in that Circuit were required to \"specifically plead those [facts] which they assert give rise to a <i>strong inference</i> that the defendants had\" the requisite state of mind. <i>Ross v. A.H. Robins Co.,</i> 607 F.2d 545, 558 (1979) (emphasis added). The \"strong inference\" formulation was appropriate, the Second Circuit said, to ward off allegations of \"fraud by hindsight.\" See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Shields v. Citytrust Bancorp, Inc.,</i> 25 F.3d 1124, 1129 (1994) (quoting <i>Denny v. Barber,</i> 576 F.2d 465, 470 (C.A.2 1978) (Friendly, J.)).</p>\n<p>Setting a uniform pleading standard for \u00a7 10(b) actions was among Congress' objectives when it enacted the PSLRA. Designed to curb perceived abuses of the \u00a7 10(b) private action\u0097\"nuisance filings, targeting of deep-pocket defendants, vexatious discovery requests and manipulation by class action lawyers,\" <i>Dabit,</i> 547 U.S., at 81, 126 S.Ct. 1503 (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369, p. 31 (1995), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1995, p. 730 (hereinafter H.R. Conf. Rep.))\u0097the PSLRA installed both substantive and procedural controls.<sup>[4]</sup> Notably, Congress prescribed new procedures for the appointment of lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. This innovation aimed to increase the likelihood that institutional investors\u0097parties more likely to balance the interests of the class with the long-term interests of the company\u0097 would serve as lead plaintiffs. See <i>id.,</i> at 33-34; S.Rep. No. 104-98, p. 11 (1995), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1995, pp. 679, 690. Congress also \"limit[ed] recoverable damages and attorney's fees, provide[d] a `safe harbor' for forward-looking statements, ... mandate[d] imposition of sanctions for frivolous litigation, and authorize[d] a stay of discovery pending resolution of any motion to dismiss.\" <i>Dabit,</i> 547 U.S., at 81, 126 S.Ct. 1503. And in \u00a7 21D(b) of the PSLRA, Congress \"impose[d] heightened pleading requirements in actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Under the PSLRA's heightened pleading instructions, any private securities complaint alleging that the defendant made a false or misleading statement must: (1) \"specify each statement alleged to have been misleading [and] the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(1); and (2) \"state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind,\" \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). In the instant case, as earlier stated, see <i>supra,</i> at 2506, the District Court and the Seventh Circuit agreed that the Shareholders met the first of the two requirements: The complaint sufficiently <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2509</span> specified Notebaert's alleged misleading statements and the reasons why the statements were misleading. 303 F.Supp.2d, at 955-961, 437 F.3d, at 596-600. But those courts disagreed on whether the Shareholders, as required by \u00a7 21D(b)(2), \"state[d] with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that [Notebaert] acted with [scienter],\" \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). See <i>supra,</i> at 2506.</p>\n<p>The \"strong inference\" standard \"unequivocally raise[d] the bar for pleading scienter,\" 437 F.3d, at 601, and signaled Congress' purpose to promote greater uniformity among the Circuits, see H.R. Conf. Rep., p. 41. But \"Congress did not ... throw much light on what facts ... suffice to create [a strong] inference,\" or on what \"degree of imagination courts can use in divining whether\" the requisite inference exists. 437 F.3d, at 601. While adopting the Second Circuit's \"strong inference\" standard, Congress did not codify that Circuit's case law interpreting the standard. See \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). See also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 18. With no clear guide from Congress other than its \"inten[tion] to strengthen existing pleading requirements,\" H.R. Conf. Rep., p. 41, Courts of Appeals have diverged again, this time in construing the term \"strong inference.\" Among the uncertainties, should courts consider competing inferences in determining whether an inference of scienter is \"strong\"? See 437 F.3d, at 601-602 (collecting cases). Our task is to prescribe a workable construction of the \"strong inference\" standard, a reading geared to the PSLRA's twin goals: to curb frivolous, lawyer-driven litigation, while preserving investors' ability to recover on meritorious claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We establish the following prescriptions: <i>First,</i> faced with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a \u00a7 10(b) action, courts must, as with any motion to dismiss for failure to plead a claim on which relief can be granted, accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true. See <i>Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit,</i> 507 U.S. 163, 164, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993). On this point, the parties agree. See Reply Brief 8; Brief for Respondents 26; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 8, 20, 21.</p>\n<p><i>Second,</i> courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice. See 5B Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 1357 (3d ed.2004 and Supp.2007). The inquiry, as several Courts of Appeals have recognized, is whether <i>all</i> of the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter, not whether any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation, meets that standard. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Abrams v. Baker Hughes Inc.,</i> 292 F.3d 424, 431 (C.A.5 2002); <i>Gompper v. VISX, Inc.,</i> 298 F.3d 893, 897 (C.A.9 2002). See also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 25.</p>\n<p><i>Third,</i> in determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a \"strong\" inference of scienter, the court must take into account plausible opposing inferences. The Seventh Circuit expressly declined to engage in such a comparative inquiry. A complaint could survive, that court said, as long as it \"alleges facts from which, if true, a reasonable person could infer that the defendant acted with the required intent\"; in other words, only \"[i]f a reasonable person could not draw such an inference from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2510</span> the alleged facts\" would the defendant prevail on a motion to dismiss. 437 F.3d, at 602. But in \u00a7 21D(b)(2), Congress did not merely require plaintiffs to \"provide a factual basis for [their] scienter allegations,\" <i>ibid.</i> (quoting <i>In re Cerner Corp. Securities Litigation,</i> 425 F.3d 1079, 1084, 1085 (C.A.8 2005)), <i>i.e.,</i> to allege facts from which an inference of scienter rationally <i>could</i> be drawn. Instead, Congress required plaintiffs to plead with particularity facts that give rise to a \"strong\"\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> a powerful or cogent\u0097inference. See American Heritage Dictionary 1717 (4th ed.2000) (defining \"strong\" as \"[p]ersuasive, effective, and cogent\"); 16 Oxford English Dictionary 949 (2d ed.1989) (defining \"strong\" as \"[p]owerful to demonstrate or convince\" (definition 16b)); cf. 7 <i>id.,</i> at 924 (defining \"inference\" as \"a conclusion [drawn] from known or assumed facts or statements\"; \"reasoning from something known or assumed to something else which follows from it\").</p>\n<p>The strength of an inference cannot be decided in a vacuum. The inquiry is inherently comparative: How likely is it that one conclusion, as compared to others, follows from the underlying facts? To determine whether the plaintiff has alleged facts that give rise to the requisite \"strong inference\" of scienter, a court must consider plausible nonculpable explanations for the defendant's conduct, as well as inferences favoring the plaintiff. The inference that the defendant acted with scienter need not be irrefutable, <i>i.e.,</i> of the \"smoking-gun\" genre, or even the \"most plausible of competing inferences,\" <i>Fidel,</i> 392 F.3d, at 227 (quoting <i>Helwig v. Vencor, Inc.,</i> 251 F.3d 540, 553 (C.A.6 2001) (en banc)). Recall in this regard that \u00a7 21D(b)'s pleading requirements are but one constraint among many the PSLRA installed to screen out frivolous suits, while allowing meritorious actions to move forward. See <i>supra,</i> at 2508, and n. 4. Yet the inference of scienter must be more than merely \"reasonable\" or \"permissible\"\u0097it must be cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other explanations. A complaint will survive, we hold, only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2511</span> B</h2>\n<p>Tellabs contends that when competing inferences are considered, Notebaert's evident lack of pecuniary motive will be dispositive. The Shareholders, Tellabs stresses, did not allege that Notebaert sold any shares during the class period. See Brief for Petitioners 50 (\"The absence of any allegations of motive color all the other allegations putatively giving rise to an inference of scienter.\"). While it is true that motive can be a relevant consideration, and personal financial gain may weigh heavily in favor of a scienter inference, we agree with the Seventh Circuit that the absence of a motive allegation is not fatal. See 437 F.3d, at 601. As earlier stated, <i>supra,</i> at 2509-2510, allegations must be considered collectively; the significance that can be ascribed to an allegation of motive, or lack thereof, depends on the entirety of the complaint.</p>\n<p>Tellabs also maintains that several of the Shareholders' allegations are too vague or ambiguous to contribute to a strong inference of scienter. For example, the Shareholders alleged that Tellabs flooded its customers with unwanted products, a practice known as \"channel stuffing.\" See <i>supra,</i> at 2505. But they failed, Tellabs argues, to specify whether the channel stuffing allegedly known to Notebaert was the illegitimate kind (<i>e.g.,</i> writing orders for products customers had not requested) or the legitimate kind (<i>e.g.,</i> offering customers discounts as an incentive to buy). Brief for Petitioners 44-46; Reply Brief 8. See also <i>id.,</i> at 8-9 (complaint lacks precise dates of reports critical to distinguish legitimate conduct from culpable conduct). But see 437 F.3d, at 598, 603-604 (pointing to multiple particulars alleged by the Shareholders, including specifications as to timing). We agree that omissions and ambiguities count against inferring scienter, for plaintiffs must \"state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). We reiterate, however, that the court's job is not to scrutinize each allegation in isolation but to assess all the allegations holistically. See <i>supra,</i> at 2509-2510; 437 F.3d, at 601. In sum, the reviewing court must ask: When the allegations are accepted as true and taken collectively, would a reasonable person deem the inference of scienter at least as strong as any opposing inference?<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Accounting for its construction of \u00a7 21D(b)(2), the Seventh Circuit explained that the court \"th[ought] it wis[e] to adopt an approach that [could not] be misunderstood as a usurpation of the jury's role.\" 437 F.3d, at 602. In our view, the Seventh Circuit's concern was undue.<sup>[7]</sup> A court's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2512</span> comparative assessment of plausible inferences, while constantly assuming the plaintiff's allegations to be true, we think it plain, does not impinge upon the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Congress, as creator of federal statutory claims, has power to prescribe what must be pleaded to state the claim, just as it has power to determine what must be proved to prevail on the merits. It is the federal lawmaker's prerogative, therefore, to allow, disallow, or shape the contours of\u0097 including the pleading and proof requirements for\u0097 \u00a7 10(b) private actions. No decision of this Court questions that authority in general, or suggests, in particular, that the Seventh Amendment inhibits Congress from establishing whatever pleading requirements it finds appropriate for federal statutory claims. Cf. <i>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,</i> 534 U.S. 506, 512-513, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002); <i>Leatherman,</i> 507 U.S., at 168, 113 S.Ct. 1160 (both recognizing that heightened pleading requirements can be established by Federal Rule, citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9(b), which requires that fraud or mistake be pleaded with particularity).<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Md. v. United States,</i> 187 U.S. 315, 23 S.Ct. 120, 47 L.Ed. 194 (1902), is instructive. That case concerned a rule adopted by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia in 1879 pursuant to rulemaking power delegated by Congress. The rule required defendants, in certain contract actions, to file an affidavit \"specifically stating ..., in precise and distinct terms, the grounds of his defen[s]e.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 318, 23 S.Ct. 120 (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant's affidavit was found insufficient, and judgment was entered for the plaintiff, whose declaration and supporting affidavit had been found satisfactory. <i>Ibid.</i> This Court upheld the District's rule against the contention that it violated the Seventh Amendment. <i>Id.,</i> at 320, 23 S.Ct. 120. Just as the purpose of \u00a7 21D(b) is to screen out frivolous complaints, the purpose of the prescription at issue in <i>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co.</i> was to \"preserve the courts from frivolous defen[s]es,\" <i>ibid.</i> Explaining why the Seventh Amendment was not implicated, this Court said that the heightened pleading rule simply \"prescribes the means of making an issue,\" and that, when \"[t]he issue [was] made as prescribed, the right of trial by jury accrues.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> accord <i>Ex parte Peterson,</i> 253 U.S. 300, 310, 40 S.Ct. 543, 64 L.Ed. 919 (1920) (Brandeis, J.) (citing <i>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co.,</i> and reiterating: \"It does not infringe the constitutional right to a trial by jury [in a civil case], to require, with a view to formulating the issues, an oath by each party to the facts relied upon.\"). See also <i>Walker v. New Mexico &amp; Southern Pacific R. Co.,</i> 165 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2513</span> U.S. 593, 596, 17 S.Ct. 421, 41 L.Ed. 837 (1897) (Seventh Amendment \"does not attempt to regulate matters of pleading\").</p>\n<p>In the instant case, provided that the Shareholders have satisfied the congressionally \"prescribe[d] ... means of making an issue,\" <i>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co.,</i> 187 U.S., at 320, 23 S.Ct. 120, the case will fall within the jury's authority to assess the credibility of witnesses, resolve any genuine issues of fact, and make the ultimate determination whether Notebaert and, by imputation, Tellabs acted with scienter. We emphasize, as well, that under our construction of the \"strong inference\" standard, a plaintiff is not forced to plead more than she would be required to prove at trial. A plaintiff alleging fraud in a \u00a7 10(b) action, we hold today, must plead facts rendering an inference of scienter <i>at least as likely as</i> any plausible opposing inference. At trial, she must then prove her case by a \"preponderance of the evidence.\" Stated otherwise, she must demonstrate that it is <i>more likely</i> than not that the defendant acted with scienter. See <i>Herman &amp; MacLean v. Huddleston,</i> 459 U.S. 375, 390, 103 S.Ct. 683, 74 L.Ed.2d 548 (1983).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>While we reject the Seventh Circuit's approach to \u00a7 21D(b)(2), we do not decide whether, under the standard we have described, see <i>supra,</i> at 2509-2511, the Shareholders' allegations warrant \"a strong inference that [Notebaert and Tellabs] acted with the required state of mind,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals had the opportunity to consider the matter in light of the prescriptions we announce today. We therefore vacate the Seventh Circuit's judgment so that the case may be reexamined in accord with our construction of \u00a7 21D(b)(2).</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I fail to see how an inference that is merely \"at least as compelling as any opposing inference,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2505, can conceivably be called what the statute here at issue requires: a \"strong inference,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). If a jade falcon were stolen from a room to which only A and B had access, could it <i>possibly</i> be said there was a \"strong inference\" that B was the thief? I think not, and I therefore think that the Court's test must fail. In my view, the test should be whether the inference of scienter (if any) is <i>more plausible</i> than the inference of innocence.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court's explicit rejection of this reading, <i>ante,</i> at 2510, rests on two assertions. The first (doubtless true) is that the statute does not require that \"[t]he inference that the defendant acted with scienter... be irrefutable, <i>i.e.,</i> of the `smoking-gun' genre,\" <i>ibid.</i> It is up to Congress, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2514</span> however, and not to us, to determine what pleading standard would avoid those extremities while yet effectively deterring baseless actions. Congress has expressed its determination in the phrase \"strong inference\"; it is our job to give that phrase its normal meaning. And if we are to abandon text in favor of unexpressed purpose, as the Court does, it is inconceivable that Congress's enactment of stringent pleading requirements in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 somehow manifests the purpose of giving plaintiffs the edge in close cases.</p>\n<p>The Court's second assertion (also true) is that \"an inference at least as likely as competing inferences can, in some cases, warrant recovery.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2510, n. 5 (citing <i>Summers v. Tice,</i> 33 Cal.2d 80, 84-87, 199 P.2d 1, 3-5 (1948) (in bank)). <i>Summers</i> is a famous case, however, because it sticks out of the ordinary body of tort law like a sore thumb. It represented \"a relaxation\" of \"such proof as is ordinarily required\" to succeed in a negligence action. <i>Id.,</i> at 86, 199 P.2d, at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted). There is no indication that the statute at issue here was meant to relax the ordinary rule under which a tie goes to the defendant. To the contrary, it explicitly strengthens that rule by extending it to the pleading stage of a case.</p>\n<p>One of petitioners' <i>amici</i> suggests that my reading of the statute would transform the text from requiring a \"strong\" inference to requiring the \"strongest\" inference. See Brief for American Association for Justice as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27. The point might have some force if Congress could have more clearly adopted my standard by using the word \"strongest\" instead of the word \"strong.\" But the use of the superlative would not have made any sense given the provision's structure: What does it mean to require a plaintiff to plead \"facts giving rise to <i>the strongest</i> inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind\"? It is certainly true that, if Congress had wanted to adopt my standard with even greater clarity, it could have restructured the entire provision\u0097to require, for example, that the plaintiff plead \"facts giving rise to <i>an inference of scienter that is more compelling than the inference that the defendant acted with a nonculpable state of mind.</i>\" But if one is to consider the possibility of total restructuring, it is equally true that, to express the Court's standard, Congress could have demanded <i>\"an inference of scienter that is at least as compelling as the inference that the defendant acted with a nonculpable state of mind.\"</i> Argument from the possibility of saying it differently is clearly a draw. We must be content to give \"strong inference\" its normal meaning. I hasten to add that, while precision of interpretation should always be pursued for its own sake, I doubt that in this instance what I deem to be the correct test will produce results much different from the Court's. How often is it that inferences are precisely in equipoise? All the more reason, I think, to read the language for what it says.</p>\n<p>The Court and the dissent criticize me for suggesting that there is only one reading of the text. <i>Ante,</i> at 2510-2511, n. 5; <i>post,</i> at 2517, n. 1 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). They are both mistaken. I assert only that mine is the natural reading of the statute (<i>i.e.,</i> the normal reading), not that it is the only conceivable one. The Court has no standing to object to this approach, since it concludes that, in another respect, the statute admits of only one natural reading, namely, that competing inferences must be weighed because the strong-inference requirement \"is inherently comparative\" <i>ante,</i> at 2510. As for the dissent, it asserts that the statute cannot possibly have a natural and discernible meaning, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2515</span> since \"courts of appeals\" and \"Members of this Court\" \"have divided\" over the question. It was just weeks ago, however, that the author of the dissent, joined by the author of today's opinion for the Court, concluded that a statute's meaning was \"plain,\" <i>Rockwell Int'l Corp. v. United States,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1397, 1412, 167 L.Ed.2d 190 (2007) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), even though the Courts of Appeals and Members of this Court divided over the question, <i>id.,</i> at ___, n. 5 (127 S.Ct., at 1407, n. 5). Was plain meaning then, as the dissent claims it is today, <i>post,</i> at 2517, n. 1, \"in the eye of the beholder\"?</p>\n<p>It is unremarkable that various Justices in this case reach different conclusions about the correct interpretation of the statutory text. It is remarkable, however, that the dissent believes that Congress \"implicitly delegated significant lawmaking authority to the Judiciary in determining how th[e] [strong-inference] standard should operate in practice.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2516-2517. This is language usually employed to describe the discretion conferred upon administrative agencies, which need not adopt what courts would consider the interpretation most faithful to the text of the statute, but may choose some other interpretation, so long as it is within the bounds of the reasonable, and may later change to some <i>other</i> interpretation that is within the bounds of the reasonable. See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Courts, by contrast, <i>must</i> give the statute its single, most plausible, reading. To describe this as an exercise of \"delegated lawmaking authority\" seems to me peculiar\u0097unless one believes in lawmakers who have no discretion. Courts must apply judgment, to be sure. But judgment is not discretion.</p>\n<p>Even if I agreed with the Court's interpretation of \"strong inference,\" I would not join the Court's opinion because of its frequent indulgence in the last remaining legal fiction of the West: that the report of a single committee of a single House expresses the will of Congress. The Court says, for example, that \"Congress'[s] purpose\" was \"to promote greater uniformity among the Circuits,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2509, relying for that certitude upon the statement of managers accompanying a House Conference Committee Report whose text was never adopted by the House, much less by the Senate, and as far as we know was read by almost no one. The Court is sure that Congress \"`inten[ded] to strengthen existing pleading requirements,'\" <i>ibid.,</i> because\u0097again\u0097the statement of managers said so. I come to the same conclusion for the much safer reason that the law which Congress adopted (and which the Members of both Houses actually <i>voted</i> on) so indicates. And had the legislation not done so, the statement of managers assuredly could not have remedied the deficiency.</p>\n<p>With the above exceptions, I am generally in agreement with the Court's analysis, and so concur in its judgment.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that the Seventh Circuit used an erroneously low standard for determining whether the plaintiffs in this case satisfied their burden of pleading \"with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). I further agree that the case should be remanded to allow the lower courts to decide in the first instance whether the allegations survive under the correct standard. In two respects, however, I disagree with the opinion of the Court. First, the best interpretation of the statute is that only those facts that are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2516</span> alleged \"with particularity\" may properly be considered in determining whether the allegations of scienter are sufficient. Second, I agree with Justice SCALIA that a \"strong inference\" of scienter, in the present context, means an inference that is more likely than not correct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On the first point, the statutory language is quite clear. Section 78u-4(b)(2) states that \"the complaint shall, with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" Thus, \"a strong inference\" of scienter must arise from those facts that are stated \"with particularity.\" It follows that facts not stated with the requisite particularity cannot be considered in determining whether the strong-inference test is met.</p>\n<p>In dicta, however, the Court states that \"omissions and ambiguities\" merely \"count against\" inferring scienter, and that a court should consider all allegations of scienter, even nonparticularized ones, when considering whether a complaint meets the \"strong inference\" requirement. <i>Ante,</i> at 2511. Not only does this interpretation contradict the clear statutory language on this point, but it undermines the particularity requirement's purpose of preventing a plaintiff from using vague or general allegations in order to get by a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Allowing a plaintiff to derive benefit from such allegations would permit him to circumvent this important provision.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Court's interpretation of the particularity requirement in no way distinguishes it from normal pleading review, under which a court naturally gives less weight to allegations containing \"omissions and ambiguities\" and more weight to allegations stating particularized facts. The particularity requirement is thus stripped of all meaning.</p>\n<p>Questions certainly may arise as to whether certain allegations meet the statutory particularity requirement, but where that requirement is violated, the offending allegations cannot be taken into account.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>I would also hold that a \"strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind\" is an inference that is stronger than the inference that the defendant lacked the required state of mind. Congress has provided very little guidance regarding the meaning of \"strong inference,\" and the difference between the Court's interpretation (the inference of scienter must be at least as strong as the inference of no scienter) and Justice SCALIA's (the inference of scienter must be at least marginally stronger than the inference of no scienter) is unlikely to make any practical difference. The two approaches are similar in that they both regard the critical question as posing a binary choice (either the facts give rise to a \"strong inference\" of scienter or they do not). But Justice SCALIA's interpretation would align the pleading test under \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2) with the test that is used at the summary-judgment and judgment-as-a-matter-of-law stages, whereas the Court's test would introduce a test previously unknown in civil litigation. It seems more likely that Congress meant to adopt a known quantity and thus to adopt Justice SCALIA's approach.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>As the Court explains, when Congress enacted a heightened pleading requirement for private actions to enforce the federal securities laws, it \"left the key term `strong inference' undefined.\" <i>Ante,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2517</span> at 2504-2505. It thus implicitly delegated significant lawmaking authority to the Judiciary in determining how that standard should operate in practice. Today the majority crafts a perfectly workable definition of the term, but I am persuaded that a different interpretation would be both easier to apply and more consistent with the statute.</p>\n<p>The basic purpose of the heightened pleading requirement in the context of securities fraud litigation is to protect defendants from the costs of discovery and trial in unmeritorious cases. Because of its intrusive nature, discovery may also invade the privacy interests of the defendants and their executives. Like citizens suspected of having engaged in criminal activity, those defendants should not be required to produce their private effects unless there is probable cause to believe them guilty of misconduct. Admittedly, the probable-cause standard is not capable of precise measurement, but it is a concept that is familiar to judges. As a matter of normal English usage, its meaning is roughly the same as \"strong inference.\" Moreover, it is most unlikely that Congress intended us to adopt a standard that makes it more difficult to commence a civil case than a criminal case.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition to the benefit of its grounding in an already familiar legal concept, using a probable-cause standard would avoid the unnecessary conclusion that \"in determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a `strong' inference of scienter, the court <i>must</i> take into account plausible opposing inferences.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2509 (emphasis added). There are times when an inference can easily be deemed strong without any need to weigh competing inferences. For example, if a known drug dealer exits a building immediately after a confirmed drug transaction, carrying a suspicious looking package, a judge could draw a strong inference that the individual was involved in the aforementioned drug transaction without debating whether the suspect might have been leaving the building at that exact time for another unrelated reason.</p>\n<p>If, using that same methodology, we assume (as we must, see <i>ante,</i> at 2509-2510, 2511) the truth of the detailed factual allegations attributed to 27 different confidential informants described in the complaint, App. 91-93, and view those allegations collectively, I think it clear that they establish probable cause to believe that Tellabs' chief executive officer \"acted with the required intent,\" as the Seventh Circuit held.<sup>[2]</sup> 437 F.3d 588, 602 (2006).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2518</span> Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Shareholders brought suit against Tellabs executives other than Notebaert, including Richard Birck, Tellabs' chairman and former chief executive officer. Because the claims against the other executives, many of which have been dismissed, are not before us, we focus on the allegations as they relate to Notebaert. We refer to the defendant-petitioners collectively as \"Tellabs.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  See, <i>e.g.,</i> 437 F.3d 588, 602 (C.A.7 2006) (decision below); <i>Brown v. Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.,</i> 431 F.3d 36, 49, 51 (C.A.1 2005); <i>Ottmann v. Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc.,</i> 353 F.3d 338, 347-349 (C.A.4 2003); <i>Pirraglia v. Novell, Inc.,</i> 339 F.3d 1182, 1187-1188 (C.A.10 2003); <i>Gompper v. VISX, Inc.,</i> 298 F.3d 893, 896-897 (C.A.9 2002); <i>Helwig v. Vencor, Inc.,</i> 251 F.3d 540, 553 (C.A.6 2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p>[3]  We have previously reserved the question whether reckless behavior is sufficient for civil liability under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. See <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</i> 425 U.S. 185, 194, n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). Every Court of Appeals that has considered the issue has held that a plaintiff may meet the scienter requirement by showing that the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly, though the Circuits differ on the degree of recklessness required. See <i>Ottmann,</i> 353 F.3d, at 343 (collecting cases). The question whether and when recklessness satisfies the scienter requirement is not presented in this case.</p>\n<p>[4]  Nothing in the Act, we have previously noted, casts doubt on the conclusion \"that private securities litigation [i]s an indispensable tool with which defrauded investors can recover their losses\"\u0097a matter crucial to the integrity of domestic capital markets. See <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v. Dabit,</i> 547 U.S. 71, 81, 126 S.Ct. 1503, 164 L.Ed.2d 179 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[5]  Justice SCALIA objects to this standard on the ground that \"[i]f a jade falcon were stolen from a room to which only A and B had access,\" it could not \"<i>possibly</i> be said there was a `strong inference' that B was the thief.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2513 (opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis in original). I suspect, however, that law enforcement officials as well as the owner of the precious falcon would find the inference of guilt as to B quite strong\u0097 certainly strong enough to warrant further investigation. Indeed, an inference at least as likely as competing inferences can, in some cases, warrant recovery. See <i>Summers v. Tice,</i> 33 Cal.2d 80, 84-87, 199 P.2d 1, 3-5 (1948) (in bank) (plaintiff wounded by gunshot could recover from two defendants, even though the most he could prove was that each defendant was at least as likely to have injured him as the other); Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 28(b), Comment <i>e,</i> p. 504 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, Apr. 6, 2005) (\"Since the publication of the Second Restatement in 1965, courts have generally accepted the alternative-liability principle of [<i>Summers v. Tice</i><i>,</i> adopted in] \u00a7 433B(3), while fleshing out its limits.\"). In any event, we disagree with Justice SCALIA that the hardly stock term \"strong inference\" has only one invariably right (\"natural\" or \"normal\") reading\u0097 his. See <i>post,</i> at 2514-2515.\n</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO agrees with Justice SCALIA, and would transpose to the pleading stage \"the test that is used at the summary-judgment and judgment-as-a-matter-of-law stages.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2516 (opinion concurring in judgment). But the test at each stage is measured against a different backdrop. It is improbable that Congress, without so stating, intended courts to test pleadings, unaided by discovery, to determine whether there is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact.\" See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c). And judgment as a matter of law is a post-trial device, turning on the question whether a party has produced evidence \"legally sufficient\" to warrant a jury determination in that party's favor. See Rule 50(a)(1).</p>\n<p>[6]  The Seventh Circuit held that allegations of scienter made against one defendant cannot be imputed to all other individual defendants. 437 F.3d, at 602-603. See also <i>id.,</i> at 603 (to proceed beyond the pleading stage, the plaintiff must allege as to each defendant facts sufficient to demonstrate a culpable state of mind regarding his or her violations) (citing <i>Phillips v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,</i> 374 F.3d 1015, 1018 (C.A.11 2004)). Though there is disagreement among the Circuits as to whether the group pleading doctrine survived the PSLRA, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Southland Securities Corp. v. INSpire Ins. Solutions Inc.,</i> 365 F.3d 353, 364 (C.A.5 2004), the Shareholders do not contest the Seventh Circuit's determination, and we do not disturb it.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Seventh Circuit raised the possibility of a Seventh Amendment problem on its own initiative. The Shareholders did not contend below that dismissal of their complaint under \u00a7 21D(b)(2) would violate their right to trial by jury. Cf. <i>Monroe Employees Retirement System v. Bridgestone Corp.,</i> 399 F.3d 651, 683, n. 25 (C.A.6 2005) (noting possible Seventh Amendment argument but declining to address it when not raised by plaintiffs).</p>\n<p>[8]  In numerous contexts, gatekeeping judicial determinations prevent submission of claims to a jury's judgment without violating the Seventh Amendment. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) (expert testimony can be excluded based on judicial determination of reliability); <i>Neely v. Martin K. Eby Constr. Co.,</i> 386 U.S. 317, 321, 87 S.Ct. 1072, 18 L.Ed.2d 75 (1967) (judgment as a matter of law); <i>Pease v. Rathbun-Jones Engineering Co.,</i> 243 U.S. 273, 278, 37 S.Ct. 283, 61 L.Ed. 715 (1917) (summary judgment).</p>\n<p>[9]  Any heightened pleading rule, including Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9(b), could have the effect of preventing a plaintiff from getting discovery on a claim that might have gone to a jury, had discovery occurred and yielded substantial evidence. In recognizing Congress' or the Federal Rule makers' authority to adopt special pleading rules, we have detected no Seventh Amendment impediment.</p>\n<p>[*]  The Court suggests that \"the owner of the precious falcon would find the inference of guilt as to B quite strong.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2510, n. 5. If he should draw such an inference, it would only prove the wisdom of the ancient maxim <i>\"aliquis non debet esse Judex in propria causa\"</i>\u0097no man ought to be a judge of his own cause. <i>Dr. Bonham's Case,</i> 8 Co. 107a, 114a, 118a, 77 Eng. Rep. 638, 646, 652 (C.P. 1610). For it is quite clear (from the dispassionate perspective of one who does not own a jade falcon) that a <i>possibility,</i> even a strong possibility, that B is responsible is not a strong <i>inference</i> that B is responsible. \"Inference\" connotes \"belief\" in what is inferred, and it would be impossible to form a strong belief that it was B and not A, or A and not B.</p>\n<p>[1]  The meaning of a statute can only be determined on a case by case basis and will, in each case, turn differently on the clarity of the statutory language, its context, and the intent of its drafters. Here, in my judgment, a probable-cause standard is more faithful to the intent of Congress, as expressed in both the specific pleading requirement and the statute as a whole, than the more defendant-friendly interpretation that Justice SCALIA prefers. He is clearly wrong in concluding that in divining the meaning of this term, we can merely \"read the language for what it says,\" and that it is susceptible to only one reading. <i>Ante,</i> at 2514 (opinion concurring in judgment). He argues that we \"must be content to give `strong inference' its normal meaning,\" <i>ibid.,</i> and yet the \"normal meaning\" of a term such as \"strong inference\" is surely in the eye of the beholder. As the Court's opinion points out, Courts of Appeals have divided on the meaning of the standard, see <i>ante,</i> at 2504-2505, 2508-2509, and today, the Members of this Court have done the same. Although Justice SCALIA may disagree with the Court's reading of the term, he should at least acknowledge that, in this case, the term itself is open to interpretation.</p>\n<p>[2]  The \"channel stuffing\" allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 62-72 of the amended complaint, App. 110-113, are particularly persuasive. Contrary to petitioners' arguments that respondents' allegations of channel stuffing \"are too vague or ambiguous to contribute to a strong inference of scienter,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2511, this portion of the complaint clearly alleges that Notebaert himself had specific knowledge of illegitimate channel stuffing during the relevant time period. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. 111, \u00b6 67 (\"Defendant Notebaert worked directly with Tellabs' sales personnel to channel stuff SBC\"); <i>id.,</i> at 110-112 (alleging, in describing such channel stuffing, that Tellabs took \"extraordinary\" steps that amounted to \"an abnormal practice in the industry\"; that \"distributors were upset and later returned the inventory\" (and, in the case of Verizon's Chairman, called Tellabs to complain); that customers \"did not want\" products that Tellabs sent and that Tellabs employees wrote purchase orders for; that \"returns were so heavy during January and February 2001 that Tellabs had to lease extra storage space to accommodate all the returns\"; and that Tellabs \"backdat[ed] sales\" that actually took place in 2001 to appear as having occurred in 2000). If these allegations are actually taken as true and viewed in the collective, it is hard to imagine what competing inference could effectively counteract the inference that Notebaert and Tellabs \"`acted with the required state of mind.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2513 (opinion of the Court) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2)).</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued March 28, 2007\u2014Decided June 21, 2007\nAs a check against abusive litigation in private securities fraud actions,\n  the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) in\n  cludes exacting pleading requirements. The Act requires plaintiffs to\n  state with particularity both the facts constituting the alleged viola\n  tion, and the facts evidencing scienter, i.e., the defendant\u2019s intention\n  \u201cto deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\u201d Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,\n  425 U. S. 185, 194, and n. 12. As set out in \u00a721D(b)(2), plaintiffs\n  must \u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference\n  that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d 15\n  U. S. C. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2). Congress left the key term \u201cstrong inference\u201d\n  undefined.\n     Petitioner Tellabs, Inc., manufactures specialized equipment for\n  fiber optic networks. Respondents (Shareholders) purchased Tellabs\n  stock between December 11, 2000, and June 19, 2001. They filed a\n  class action, alleging that Tellabs and petitioner Notebaert, then\n  Tellabs\u2019 chief executive officer and president, had engaged in securi\n  ties fraud in violation of \u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n  and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b\u20135, and that\n  Notebaert was a \u201ccontrolling person\u201d under the 1934 Act, and there\n  fore derivatively liable for the company\u2019s fraudulent acts. Tellabs\n  moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Shareholders\n  had failed to plead their case with the particularity the PSLRA re\n  quires. The District Court agreed, dismissing the complaint without\n  prejudice. The Shareholders then amended their complaint, adding\n  references to 27 confidential sources and making further, more spe\n  cific, allegations concerning Notebaert\u2019s mental state. The District\n  Court again dismissed, this time with prejudice. The Shareholders\n2         TELLABS, INC. v. MAKOR ISSUES & RIGHTS, LTD.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    had sufficiently pleaded that Notebaert\u2019s statements were mislead\n    ing, the court determined, but they had insufficiently alleged that he\n    acted with scienter. The Seventh Circuit reversed in relevant part.\n    Like the District Court, it found that the Shareholders had pleaded\n    the misleading character of Notebaert\u2019s statements with sufficient\n    particularity. Unlike the District Court, however, it concluded that\n    the Shareholders had sufficiently alleged that Notebaert acted with\n    the requisite state of mind. In evaluating whether the PSLRA\u2019s\n    pleading standard is met, the Circuit said, courts should examine all\n    of the complaint\u2019s allegations to decide whether collectively they es\n    tablish an inference of scienter; the complaint would survive, the\n    court stated, if a reasonable person could infer from the complaint\u2019s\n    allegations that the defendant acted with the requisite state of mind.\nHeld: To qualify as \u201cstrong\u201d within the intendment of \u00a721D(b)(2), an\n inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or reason\n able\u2014it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing\n inference of nonfraudulent intent. Pp. 6\u201318.\n    (a) Setting a uniform pleading standard for \u00a710(b) actions was\n among Congress\u2019 objectives in enacting the PSLRA. Designed to curb\n perceived abuses of the \u00a710(b) private action, the PSLRA installed\n both substantive and procedural controls. As relevant here, \u00a721D(b)\n of the PSLRA \u201cimpose[d] heightened pleading requirements in\n [\u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135] actions.\u201d Dabit, 547 U. S., at 81. In the in\n stant case, the District Court and the Seventh Circuit agreed that the\n complaint sufficiently specified Notebaert\u2019s alleged misleading\n statements and the reasons why the statements were misleading.\n But those courts disagreed on whether the Shareholders, as required\n by \u00a721D(b)(2), \u201cstate[d] with particularity facts giving rise to a strong\n inference that [Notebaert] acted with [scienter],\u201d \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2). Con\n gress did not shed much light on what facts would create a strong in\n ference or how courts could determine the existence of the requisite\n inference. With no clear guide from Congress other than its \u201cin\n ten[tion] to strengthen existing pleading requirements,\u201d H. R. Conf.\n Rep., at 41, Courts of Appeals have diverged in construing the term\n \u201cstrong inference.\u201d Among the uncertainties, should courts consider\n competing inferences in determining whether an inference of scienter\n is \u201cstrong\u201d? This Court\u2019s task is to prescribe a workable construction\n of the \u201cstrong inference\u201d standard, a reading geared to the PSLRA\u2019s\n twin goals: to curb frivolous, lawyer-driven litigation, while preserv\n ing investors\u2019 ability to recover on meritorious claims. Pp. 6\u201310.\n    (b) The Court establishes the following prescriptions: First, faced\n with a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a\n \u00a710(b) action, courts must, as with any motion to dismiss for failure\n to plead a claim on which relief can be granted, accept all factual al\n                   Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nlegations in the complaint as true. See Leatherman v. Tarrant\nCounty Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163,\n164. Second, courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as\nwell as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule\n12(b)(6) motions. The inquiry is whether all of the facts alleged,\ntaken collectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter, not\nwhether any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation, meets\nthat standard. Third, in determining whether the pleaded facts give\nrise to a \u201cstrong\u201d inference of scienter, the court must take into ac\ncount plausible opposing inferences. The Seventh Circuit expressly\ndeclined to engage in such a comparative inquiry. But in \u00a721D(b)(2),\nCongress did not merely require plaintiffs to allege facts from which\nan inference of scienter rationally could be drawn. Instead, Congress\nrequired plaintiffs to plead with particularity facts that give rise to a\n\u201cstrong\u201d\u2014i.e., a powerful or cogent\u2014inference.           To determine\nwhether the plaintiff has alleged facts giving rise to the requisite\n\u201cstrong inference,\u201d a court must consider plausible nonculpable ex\nplanations for the defendant\u2019s conduct, as well as inferences favoring\nthe plaintiff. The inference that the defendant acted with scienter\nneed not be irrefutable, but it must be more than merely \u201creasonable\u201d\nor \u201cpermissible\u201d\u2014it must be cogent and compelling, thus strong in\nlight of other explanations. A complaint will survive only if a reason\nable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least\nas compelling as any plausible opposing inference one could draw\nfrom the facts alleged. Pp. 11\u201313.\n   (c) Tellabs contends that when competing inferences are consid\nered, Notebaert\u2019s evident lack of pecuniary motive will be dispositive.\nThe Court agrees that motive can be a relevant consideration, and\npersonal financial gain may weigh heavily in favor of a scienter infer\nence. The absence of a motive allegation, however, is not fatal for al\nlegations must be considered collectively; the significance that can be\nascribed to an allegation of motive, or lack thereof, depends on the\ncomplaint\u2019s entirety. Tellabs also maintains that several of the\nShareholders\u2019 allegations are too vague or ambiguous to contribute to\na strong inference of scienter. While omissions and ambiguities\ncount against inferring scienter, the court\u2019s job is not to scrutinize\neach allegation in isolation but to access all the allegations holisti\ncally. Pp. 13\u201315.\n   (d) The Seventh Circuit was unduly concerned that a court\u2019s com\nparative assessment of plausible inferences would impinge upon the\nSeventh Amendment right to jury trial. Congress, as creator of fed\neral statutory claims, has power to prescribe what must be pleaded to\nstate the claim, just as it has power to determine what must be\nproved to prevail on the merits. It is the federal lawmaker\u2019s preroga\n4         TELLABS, INC. v. MAKOR ISSUES & RIGHTS, LTD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tive, therefore, to allow, disallow, or shape the contours of\u2014including\n    the pleading and proof requirements for\u2014\u00a710(b) private actions.\n    This Court has never questioned that authority in general, or sug\n    gested, in particular, that the Seventh Amendment inhibits Congress\n    from establishing whatever pleading requirements it finds appropri\n    ate for federal statutory claims. Provided that the Shareholders have\n    satisfied the congressionally \u201cprescribe[d] . . . means of making an is\n    sue,\u201d Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Md. v. United States, 187 U. S. 315,\n    320, the case will fall within the jury\u2019s authority to assess the credi\n    bility of witnesses, resolve genuine issues of fact, and make the ulti\n    mate determination whether Notebaert and, by imputation, Tellabs\n    acted with scienter. Under this Court\u2019s construction of the \u201cstrong in\n    ference\u201d standard, a plaintiff is not forced to plead more than she\n    would be required to prove at trial. A plaintiff alleging fraud under\n    \u00a710(b) must plead facts rendering an inference of scienter at least as\n    likely as any plausible opposing inference. At trial, she must then\n    prove her case by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d Pp. 15\u201317.\n       (e) Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals had the op\n    portunity to consider whether the Shareholders\u2019 allegations warrant\n    \u201ca strong inference that [Notebaert and Tellabs] acted with the re\n    quired state of mind,\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2), in light of the pre\n    scriptions announced today. Thus, the case is remanded for a deter\n    mination under this Court\u2019s construction of \u00a721D(b)(2).

See, e.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.\nBroudo, 544 U. S. 336, 345 (2005); J. I. Case Co. v. Borak,\n377 U. S. 426, 432 (1964). Private securities fraud actions,\nhowever, if not adequately contained, can be employed\nabusively to impose substantial costs on companies and\nindividuals whose conduct conforms to the law. See\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547\nU. S. 71, 81 (2006). As a check against abusive litigation\nby private parties, Congress enacted the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 109 Stat. 737.\n  Exacting pleading requirements are among the control\nmeasures Congress included in the PSLRA. The Act\nrequires plaintiffs to state with particularity both the facts\nconstituting the alleged violation, and the facts evidencing\nscienter, i.e., the defendant\u2019s intention \u201cto deceive, ma\n2      TELLABS, INC. v. MAKOR ISSUES & RIGHTS, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnipulate, or defraud.\u201d Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425\nU. S. 185, 194, and n. 12 (1976); see 15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u2013\n4(b)(1),(2). This case concerns the latter requirement. As\nset out in \u00a721D(b)(2) of the PSLRA, plaintiffs must \u201cstate\nwith particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference\nthat the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d\n15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2).\n   Congress left the key term \u201cstrong inference\u201d undefined,\nand Courts of Appeals have divided on its meaning. In the\ncase before us, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Cir\ncuit held that the \u201cstrong inference\u201d standard would be\nmet if the complaint \u201callege[d] facts from which, if true, a\nreasonable person could infer that the defendant acted\nwith the required intent.\u201d 437 F. 3d 588, 602 (2006). That\nformulation, we conclude, does not capture the stricter\ndemand Congress sought to convey in \u00a721D(b)(2). It does\nnot suffice that a reasonable factfinder plausibly could\ninfer from the complaint\u2019s allegations the requisite state of\nmind. Rather, to determine whether a complaint\u2019s sci\nenter allegations can survive threshold inspection for\nsufficiency, a court governed by \u00a721D(b)(2) must engage in\na comparative evaluation; it must consider, not only infer\nences urged by the plaintiff, as the Seventh Circuit did,\nbut also competing inferences rationally drawn from the\nfacts alleged. An inference of fraudulent intent may be\nplausible, yet less cogent than other, nonculpable explana\ntions for the defendant\u2019s conduct. To qualify as \u201cstrong\u201d\nwithin the intendment of \u00a721D(b)(2), we hold, an inference\nof scienter must be more than merely plausible or reason\nable\u2014it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any\nopposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.\n                             I\n  Petitioner Tellabs, Inc., manufactures specialized\nequipment used in fiber optic networks. During the time\nperiod relevant to this case, petitioner Richard Notebaert\n                    Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwas Tellabs\u2019 chief executive officer and president. Re\nspondents (Shareholders) are persons who purchased\nTellabs stock between December 11, 2000, and June 19,\n2001. They accuse Tellabs and Notebaert (as well as\nseveral other Tellabs executives) of engaging in a scheme\nto deceive the investing public about the true value of\nTellabs\u2019 stock. See 437 F. 3d, at 591; App. 94\u201398.1\n  Beginning on December 11, 2000, the Shareholders\nallege, Notebaert (and by imputation Tellabs) \u201cfalsely\nreassured public investors, in a series of statements . . .\nthat Tellabs was continuing to enjoy strong demand for its\nproducts and earning record revenues,\u201d when, in fact,\nNotebaert knew the opposite was true. Id., at 94\u201395, 98.\nFrom December 2000 until the spring of 2001, the Share\nholders claim, Notebaert knowingly misled the public in\nfour ways. 437 F. 3d, at 596. First, he made statements\nindicating that demand for Tellabs\u2019 flagship networking\ndevice, the TITAN 5500, was continuing to grow, when in\nfact demand for that product was waning. Id., at 596, 597.\nSecond, Notebaert made statements indicating that the\nTITAN 6500, Tellabs\u2019 next-generation networking device,\nwas available for delivery, and that demand for that prod\nuct was strong and growing, when in truth the product\nwas not ready for delivery and demand was weak. Id., at\n596, 597\u2013598. Third, he falsely represented Tellabs\u2019 fi\nnancial results for the fourth quarter of 2000 (and, in\nconnection with those results, condoned the practice of\n\u201cchannel stuffing,\u201d under which Tellabs flooded its cus\ntomers with unwanted products). Id., at 596, 598. Fourth,\nNotebaert made a series of overstated revenue projections,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Shareholders brought suit against Tellabs executives other than\n\nNotebaert, including Richard Birck, Tellabs\u2019 chairman and former chief\nexecutive officer. Because the claims against the other executives,\nmany of which have been dismissed, are not before us, we focus on the\nallegations as they relate to Notebaert. We refer to the defendant-\npetitioners collectively as \u201cTellabs.\u201d\n4      TELLABS, INC. v. MAKOR ISSUES & RIGHTS, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen demand for the TITAN 5500 was drying up and\nproduction of the TITAN 6500 was behind schedule. Id.,\nat 596, 598\u2013599. Based on Notebaert\u2019s sunny assess\nments, the Shareholders contend, market analysts rec\nommended that investors buy Tellabs\u2019 stock. See id., at\n592.\n   The first public glimmer that business was not so\nhealthy came in March 2001 when Tellabs modestly re\nduced its first quarter sales projections. Ibid. In the next\nmonths, Tellabs made progressively more cautious state\nments about its projected sales. On June 19, 2001, the\nlast day of the class period, Tellabs disclosed that demand\nfor the TITAN 5500 had significantly dropped. Id., at 593.\nSimultaneously, the company substantially lowered its\nrevenue projections for the second quarter of 2001. The\nnext day, the price of Tellabs stock, which had reached a\nhigh of $67 during the period, plunged to a low of $15.87.\nIbid.\n   On December 3, 2002, the Shareholders filed a class\naction in the District Court for the Northern District of\nIllinois. Ibid. Their complaint stated, inter alia, that\nTellabs and Notebaert had engaged in securities fraud in\nviolation of \u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\n48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778j(b), and SEC Rule 10b\u20135, 17\nCFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135 (2006), also that Notebaert was a \u201ccon\ntrolling person\u201d under \u00a720(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778t(a), and therefore derivatively liable for the company\u2019s\nfraudulent acts. See App. 98\u2013101, 167\u2013171. Tellabs\nmoved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the\nShareholders had failed to plead their case with the par\nticularity the PSLRA requires. The District Court agreed,\nand therefore dismissed the complaint without prejudice.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 80a\u2013117a; see Johnson v. Tellabs,\nInc., 303 F. Supp. 2d 941, 945 (ND Ill. 2004).\n   The Shareholders then amended their complaint, adding\nreferences to 27 confidential sources and making further,\n                  Cite as: 551 U.

The Shareholders had sufficiently\npleaded that Notebaert\u2019s statements were misleading, the\ncourt determined, id., at 955\u2013961, but they had insuffi\nciently alleged that he acted with scienter, id., at 954\u2013955,\n961\u2013969.\n    The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed in\nrelevant part. 437 F. 3d, at 591. Like the District Court,\nthe Court of Appeals found that the Shareholders had\npleaded the misleading character of Notebaert\u2019s state\nments with sufficient particularity. Id., at 595\u2013600.\nUnlike the District Court, however, the Seventh Circuit\nconcluded that the Shareholders had sufficiently alleged\nthat Notebaert acted with the requisite state of mind. Id.,\nat 603\u2013605.\n    The Court of Appeals recognized that the PSLRA \u201cun\nequivocally raise[d] the bar for pleading scienter\u201d by re\nquiring plaintiffs to \u201cplea[d] sufficient facts to create a\nstrong inference of scienter.\u201d Id., at 601 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). In evaluating whether that pleading\nstandard is met, the Seventh Circuit said, \u201ccourts [should]\nexamine all of the allegations in the complaint and then\n. . . decide whether collectively they establish such an\ninference.\u201d Ibid. \u201c[W]e will allow the complaint to sur\nvive,\u201d the court next and critically stated, \u201cif it alleges\nfacts from which, if true, a reasonable person could infer\nthat the defendant acted with the required intent . . . . If a\nreasonable person could not draw such an inference from\nthe alleged facts, the defendants are entitled to dismissal.\u201d\nId., at 602.\n    In adopting its standard for the survival of a complaint,\nthe Seventh Circuit explicitly rejected a stiffer standard\nadopted by the Sixth Circuit, i.e., that \u201cplaintiffs are enti\ntled only to the most plausible of competing inferences.\u201d\n6       TELLABS, INC. v. MAKOR ISSUES & RIGHTS, LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 601, 602 (quoting Fidel v. Farley, 392 F. 3d 220, 227\n(CA6 2004)). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s standard, the court\nobserved, because it involved an assessment of competing\ninferences, \u201ccould potentially infringe upon plaintiffs\u2019\nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 437 F. 3d, at 602. We\ngranted certiorari to resolve the disagreement among the\nCircuits on whether, and to what extent, a court must\nconsider competing inferences in determining whether a\nsecurities fraud complaint gives rise to a \u201cstrong infer\nence\u201d of scienter.2 549 U.

MAKOR ISSUES & RIGHTS, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Court and the Seventh Circuit agreed that the\nShareholders met the first of the two requirements: The\ncomplaint sufficiently specified Notebaert\u2019s alleged mis\nleading statements and the reasons why the statements\nwere misleading. 303 F. Supp. 2d, at 955\u2013961; 437 F. 3d,\nat 596\u2013600. But those courts disagreed on whether the\nShareholders, as required by \u00a721D(b)(2), \u201cstate[d] with\nparticularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that\n[Notebaert] acted with [scienter],\u201d \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2).

See 437\nF. 3d, at 601\u2013602 (collecting cases). Our task is to pre\nscribe a workable construction of the \u201cstrong inference\u201d\nstandard, a reading geared to the PSLRA\u2019s twin goals: to\ncurb frivolous, lawyer-driven litigation, while preserving\ninvestors\u2019 ability to recover on meritorious claims.\n                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               III \n\n                                A\n\n   We establish the following prescriptions: First, faced\nwith a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a \u00a710(b) action,\ncourts must, as with any motion to dismiss for failure to\nplead a claim on which relief can be granted, accept all\nfactual allegations in the complaint as true. See Leather-\nman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordi\nnation Unit, 507 U. S. 163, 164 (1993). On this point, the\nparties agree. See Reply Brief 8; Brief for Respondents 26;\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 8, 20, 21.\n   Second, courts must consider the complaint in its en\ntirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine\nwhen ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in par\nticular, documents incorporated into the complaint by\nreference, and matters of which a court may take judicial\nnotice. See 5B Wright & Miller \u00a71357 (3d ed. 2004 and\nSupp. 2007). The inquiry, as several Courts of Appeals\nhave recognized, is whether all of the facts alleged, taken\ncollectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter, not\nwhether any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation,\nmeets that standard. See, e.g., Abrams v. Baker Hughes\nInc., 292 F. 3d 424, 431 (CA5 2002); Gompper v. VISX,\nInc., 298 F. 3d 893, 897 (CA9 2002). See also Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 25.\n   Third, in determining whether the pleaded facts give\nrise to a \u201cstrong\u201d inference of scienter, the court must take\ninto account plausible opposing inferences. The Seventh\nCircuit expressly declined to engage in such a comparative\ninquiry. A complaint could survive, that court said, as\nlong as it \u201calleges facts from which, if true, a reasonable\nperson could infer that the defendant acted with the re\nquired intent\u201d; in other words, only \u201c[i]f a reasonable\nperson could not draw such an inference from the alleged\nfacts\u201d would the defendant prevail on a motion to dismiss.\n437 F. 3d, at 602. But in \u00a721D(b)(2), Congress did not\n12     TELLABS, INC. v. MAKOR ISSUES & RIGHTS, LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmerely require plaintiffs to \u201cprovide a factual basis for\n[their] scienter allegations,\u201d ibid. (quoting In re Cerner\nCorp. Securities Litigation, 425 F. 3d 1079, 1084, 1085\n(CA8 2005)), i.e., to allege facts from which an inference of\nscienter rationally could be drawn. Instead, Congress\nrequired plaintiffs to plead with particularity facts that\ngive rise to a \u201cstrong\u201d\u2014i.e., a powerful or cogent\u2014\ninference. See American Heritage Dictionary 1717 (4th\ned. 2000) (defining \u201cstrong\u201d as \u201c[p]ersuasive, effective, and\ncogent\u201d); 16 Oxford English Dictionary 949 (2d ed. 1989)\n(defining \u201cstrong\u201d as \u201c[p]owerful to demonstrate or con\nvince\u201d (definition 16b)); cf. 7 id., at 924 (defining \u201cinfer\nence\u201d as \u201ca conclusion [drawn] from known or assumed\nfacts or statements\u201d; \u201creasoning from something known or\nassumed to something else which follows from it\u201d).\n   The strength of an inference cannot be decided in a\nvacuum. The inquiry is inherently comparative: How\nlikely is it that one conclusion, as compared to others,\nfollows from the underlying facts? To determine whether\nthe plaintiff has alleged facts that give rise to the requisite\n\u201cstrong inference\u201d of scienter, a court must consider plau\nsible nonculpable explanations for the defendant\u2019s con\nduct, as well as inferences favoring the plaintiff. The\ninference that the defendant acted with scienter need not\nbe irrefutable, i.e., of the \u201csmoking-gun\u201d genre, or even the\n\u201cmost plausible of competing inferences,\u201d Fidel, 392 F. 3d,\nat 227 (quoting Helwig v.

See supra,\nat 9, and n. 4. Yet the inference of scienter must be more\nthan merely \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cpermissible\u201d\u2014it must be\ncogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other expla\nnations. A complaint will survive, we hold, only if a rea\nsonable person would deem the inference of scienter co\n                     Cite as: 551 U.

The Shareholders, Tellabs stresses, did\nnot allege that Notebaert sold any shares during the class\nperiod. See Brief for Petitioners 50 (\u201cThe absence of any\nallegations of motive color all the other allegations puta\ntively giving rise to an inference of scienter.\u201d). While it is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 JUSTICE SCALIA objects to this standard on the ground that \u201c[i]f a\n\njade falcon were stolen from a room to which only A and B had access,\u201d\nit could not \u201cpossibly be said there was a \u2018strong inference\u2019 that B was\nthe thief.\u201d Post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis in\noriginal). I suspect, however, that law enforcement officials as well as\nthe owner of the precious falcon would find the inference of guilt as to B\nquite strong\u2014certainly strong enough to warrant further investigation.\nIndeed, an inference at least as likely as competing inferences can, in\nsome cases, warrant recovery. See Summers v. Tice, 33 Cal. 2d 80, 84\u2013\n87, 199 P. 2d 1, 3\u20135 (1948) (in bank) (plaintiff wounded by gunshot\ncould recover from two defendants, even though the most he could\nprove was that each defendant was at least as likely to have injured\nhim as the other); Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a728(b), Comment e, p.\n504 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, Apr. 6, 2005) (\u201cSince the publication of\nthe Second Restatement in 1965, courts have generally accepted the\nalternative-liability principle of [Summers v.

In any event, we disagree with JUSTICE\nSCALIA that the hardly stock term \u201cstrong inference\u201d has only one\ninvariably right (\u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d) reading\u2014his.

But the test at each stage is measured against a different\nbackdrop. It is improbable that Congress, without so stating, intended\ncourts to test pleadings, unaided by discovery, to determine whether\nthere is \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d See Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 56(c). And judgment as a matter of law is a post-trial device,\nturning on the question whether a party has produced evidence \u201clegally\nsufficient\u201d to warrant a jury determination in that party\u2019s favor.

MAKOR ISSUES & RIGHTS, LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntrue that motive can be a relevant consideration, and\npersonal financial gain may weigh heavily in favor of a\nscienter inference, we agree with the Seventh Circuit that\nthe absence of a motive allegation is not fatal. See 437\nF. 3d, at 601. As earlier stated, supra, at 11, allegations\nmust be considered collectively; the significance that can\nbe ascribed to an allegation of motive, or lack thereof,\ndepends on the entirety of the complaint.\n   Tellabs also maintains that several of the Shareholders\u2019\nallegations are too vague or ambiguous to contribute to a\nstrong inference of scienter. For example, the Sharehold\ners alleged that Tellabs flooded its customers with un\nwanted products, a practice known as \u201cchannel stuffing.\u201d\nSee supra, at 3. But they failed, Tellabs argues, to specify\nwhether the channel stuffing allegedly known to Note\nbaert was the illegitimate kind (e.g., writing orders for\nproducts customers had not requested) or the legitimate\nkind (e.g., offering customers discounts as an incentive to\nbuy). Brief for Petitioners 44\u201346; Reply Brief 8. See also\nid., at 8\u20139 (complaint lacks precise dates of reports critical\nto distinguish legitimate conduct from culpable conduct).\nBut see 437 F. 3d, at 598, 603\u2013604 (pointing to multiple\nparticulars alleged by the Shareholders, including specifi\ncations as to timing). We agree that omissions and ambi\nguities count against inferring scienter, for plaintiffs must\n\u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong infer\nence that the defendant acted with the required state of\nmind.\u201d \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2). We reiterate, however, that the\ncourt\u2019s job is not to scrutinize each allegation in isolation\nbut to assess all the allegations holistically. See supra, at\n11; 437 F. 3d, at 601. In sum, the reviewing court must\nask: When the allegations are accepted as true and taken\ncollectively, would a reasonable person deem the inference\nof scienter at least as strong as any opposing inference? 6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 6 The   Seventh Circuit held that allegations of scienter made against\n                     Cite as: 551 U.

In our\nview, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s concern was undue.7 A court\u2019s\ncomparative assessment of plausible inferences, while\nconstantly assuming the plaintiff\u2019s allegations to be true,\nwe think it plain, does not impinge upon the Seventh\nAmendment right to jury trial.8\n  Congress, as creator of federal statutory claims, has\npower to prescribe what must be pleaded to state the\nclaim, just as it has power to determine what must be\nproved to prevail on the merits. It is the federal law\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\none defendant cannot be imputed to all other individual defendants.\n437 F. 3d, at 602\u2013603. See also id., at 603 (to proceed beyond the\npleading stage, the plaintiff must allege as to each defendant facts\nsufficient to demonstrate a culpable state of mind regarding his or her\nviolations) (citing Phillips v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 374 F. 3d 1015,\n1018 (CA11 2004)). Though there is disagreement among the Circuits\nas to whether the group pleading doctrine survived the PSLRA, see,\ne.g., Southland Securities Corp. v. Inspire Ins. Solutions Inc., 365 F. 3d\n353, 364 (CA5 2004), the Shareholders do not contest the Seventh\nCircuit\u2019s determination, and we do not disturb it.\n   7 The Seventh Circuit raised the possibility of a Seventh Amendment\n\nproblem on its own initiative. The Shareholders did not contend below\nthat dismissal of their complaint under \u00a721D(b)(2) would violate their\nright to trial by jury. Cf. Monroe Employees Retirement System v.\nBridgestone Corp., 399 F. 3d 651, 683, n. 25 (CA6 2005) (noting possible\nSeventh Amendment argument but declining to address it when not\nraised by plaintiffs).\n   8 In numerous contexts, gatekeeping judicial determinations prevent\n\nsubmission of claims to a jury\u2019s judgment without violating the Seventh\nAmendment. See, e.g., Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,\n509 U. S. 579, 589 (1993) (expert testimony can be excluded based on\njudicial determination of reliability); Neely v. Martin K. Eby Constr.\nCo., 386 U. S. 317, 321 (1967) (judgment as a matter of law); Pease v.\nRathbun-Jones Engineering Co., 243 U. S. 273, 278 (1917) (summary\njudgment).\n16      TELLABS, INC. v.

No decision of this\nCourt questions that authority in general, or suggests, in\nparticular, that the Seventh Amendment inhibits Con\ngress from establishing whatever pleading requirements it\nfinds appropriate for federal statutory claims.            Cf.\nSwierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U. S. 506, 512\u2013513\n(2002); Leatherman, 507 U. S., at 168 (both recognizing\nthat heightened pleading requirements can be established\nby Federal Rule, citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9(b),\nwhich requires that fraud or mistake be pleaded with\nparticularity).9\n   Our decision in Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Md. v. United\nStates, 187 U. S. 315 (1902), is instructive. That case\nconcerned a rule adopted by the Supreme Court of the\nDistrict of Columbia in 1879 pursuant to rulemaking\npower delegated by Congress. The rule required defen\ndants, in certain contract actions, to file an affidavit \u201cspe\ncifically stating . . . , in precise and distinct terms, the\ngrounds of his defen[s]e.\u201d Id., at 318 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The defendant\u2019s affidavit was found\ninsufficient, and judgment was entered for the plaintiff,\nwhose declaration and supporting affidavit had been found\nsatisfactory. Ibid. This Court upheld the District\u2019s rule\nagainst the contention that it violated the Seventh\nAmendment. Id., at 320. Just as the purpose of \u00a721D(b) is\nto screen out frivolous complaints, the purpose of the\nprescription at issue in Fidelity & Deposit Co. was to\n\u201cpreserve the courts from frivolous defen[s]es,\u201d ibid.

In recognizing Congress\u2019 or the Federal\nRule makers\u2019 authority to adopt special pleading rules, we have de\ntected no Seventh Amendment impediment.\n                  Cite as: 551 U.

See also Walker v. New\nMexico & Southern Pacific R. Co., 165 U.

We em\nphasize, as well, that under our construction of the \u201cstrong\ninference\u201d standard, a plaintiff is not forced to plead more\nthan she would be required to prove at trial. A plaintiff\nalleging fraud in a \u00a710(b) action, we hold today, must\nplead facts rendering an inference of scienter at least as\nlikely as any plausible opposing inference. At trial, she\nmust then prove her case by a \u201cpreponderance of the\nevidence.\u201d Stated otherwise, she must demonstrate that it\nis more likely than not that the defendant acted with\nscienter.

S. C. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2). If a\njade falcon were stolen from a room to which only A and B\nhad access, could it possibly be said there was a \u201cstrong\ninference\u201d that B was the thief? I think not, and I there\nfore think that the Court\u2019s test must fail. In my view, the\ntest should be whether the inference of scienter (if any) is\nmore plausible than the inference of innocence.*\n  The Court\u2019s explicit rejection of this reading, ante, at 12,\nrests on two assertions. The first (doubtless true) is that\nthe statute does not require that \u201c[t]he inference that the\ndefendant acted with scienter . . . be irrefutable, i.e., of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * The Court suggests that \u201cthe owner of the precious falcon would\nfind the inference of guilt as to B quite strong.\u201d Ante, at 13, n. 5. If he\nshould draw such an inference, it would only prove the wisdom of the\nancient maxim \u201caliquis non debet esse Judex in propria causa\u201d\u2014no man\nought to be a judge of his own cause. Dr. Bonham\u2019s Case, 8 Co. 107a,\n114a, 118a, 77 Eng. Rep. 638, 646, 652 (C. P. 1610). For it is quite clear\n(from the dispassionate perspective of one who does not own a jade\nfalcon) that a possibility, even a strong possibility, that B is responsible\nis not a strong inference that B is responsible. \u201cInference\u201d connotes\n\u201cbelief\u201d in what is inferred, and it would be impossible to form a strong\nbelief that it was B and not A, or A and not B.\n2      TELLABS, INC. v. MAKOR ISSUES & RIGHTS, LTD.\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u2018smoking-gun\u2019 genre,\u201d ibid. It is up to Congress, however,\nand not to us, to determine what pleading standard would\navoid those extremities while yet effectively deterring\nbaseless actions. Congress has expressed its determina\ntion in the phrase \u201cstrong inference\u201d; it is our job to give\nthat phrase its normal meaning. And if we are to abandon\ntext in favor of unexpressed purpose, as the Court does, it\nis inconceivable that Congress\u2019s enactment of stringent\npleading requirements in the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995 somehow manifests the purpose of\ngiving plaintiffs the edge in close cases.\n   The Court\u2019s second assertion (also true) is that \u201can\ninference at least as likely as competing inferences can, in\nsome cases, warrant recovery.\u201d Ante, at 13, n. 5 (citing\nSummers v. Tice, 33 Cal. 2d 80, 84\u201387, 199 P. 2d 1, 3\u20135\n(1948) (in bank)). Summers is a famous case, however,\nbecause it sticks out of the ordinary body of tort law like a\nsore thumb. It represented \u201ca relaxation\u201d of \u201csuch proof as\nis ordinarily required\u201d to succeed in a negligence action.\nId., at 86, 199 P. 2d, at 4 (internal quotation marks omit\nted). There is no indication that the statute at issue here\nwas meant to relax the ordinary rule under which a tie\ngoes to the defendant. To the contrary, it explicitly\nstrengthens that rule by extending it to the pleading stage\nof a case.\n   One of petitioners\u2019 amici suggests that my reading of the\nstatute would transform the text from requiring a \u201cstrong\u201d\ninference to requiring the \u201cstrongest\u201d inference. See Brief\nfor American Association for Justice as Amicus Curiae 27.\nThe point might have some force if Congress could have\nmore clearly adopted my standard by using the word\n\u201cstrongest\u201d instead of the word \u201cstrong.\u201d But the use of\nthe superlative would not have made any sense given the\nprovision\u2019s structure: What does it mean to require a\nplaintiff to plead \u201cfacts giving rise to the strongest infer\nence that the defendant acted with the required state of\n                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)              3\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmind\u201d? It is certainly true that, if Congress had wanted to\nadopt my standard with even greater clarity, it could have\nrestructured the entire provision\u2014to require, for example,\nthat the plaintiff plead \u201cfacts giving rise to an inference of\nscienter that is more compelling than the inference that the\ndefendant acted with a nonculpable state of mind.\u201d But if\none is to consider the possibility of total restructuring, it is\nequally true that, to express the Court\u2019s standard, Con\ngress could have demanded \u201can inference of scienter that is\nat least as compelling as the inference that the defendant\nacted with a nonculpable state of mind.\u201d Argument from\nthe possibility of saying it differently is clearly a draw.\nWe must be content to give \u201cstrong inference\u201d its normal\nmeaning. I hasten to add that, while precision of interpre\ntation should always be pursued for its own sake, I doubt\nthat in this instance what I deem to be the correct test will\nproduce results much different from the Court\u2019s. How\noften is it that inferences are precisely in equipoise? All\nthe more reason, I think, to read the language for what it\nsays.\n  The Court and the dissent criticize me for suggesting\nthat there is only one reading of the text. Ante, at 13, n. 5;\npost, at 2, n. 1 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). They are both\nmistaken. I assert only that mine is the natural reading of\nthe statute (i.e., the normal reading), not that it is the only\nconceivable one. The Court has no standing to object to\nthis approach, since it concludes that, in another respect,\nthe statute admits of only one natural reading, namely,\nthat competing inferences must be weighed because the\nstrong-inference requirement \u201cis inherently comparative\u201d\nante, at 12. As for the dissent, it asserts that the statute\ncannot possibly have a natural and discernible meaning,\nsince \u201ccourts of appeals\u201d and \u201cMembers of this Court\u201d\n\u201chave divided\u201d over the question. It was just weeks ago,\nhowever, that the author of the dissent, joined by the\nauthor of today\u2019s opinion for the Court, concluded that a\n4      TELLABS, INC. v.

Was plain mean\ning then, as the dissent claims it is today, post, at 2, n. 1,\n\u201cin the eye of the beholder\u201d?\n   It is unremarkable that various Justices in this case\nreach different conclusions about the correct interpreta\ntion of the statutory text. It is remarkable, however, that\nthe dissent believes that Congress \u201cimplicitly delegated\nsignificant lawmaking authority to the Judiciary in de\ntermining how th[e] [strong-inference] standard should\noperate in practice.\u201d Post, at 1. This is language usually\nemployed to describe the discretion conferred upon admin\nistrative agencies, which need not adopt what courts\nwould consider the interpretation most faithful to the text\nof the statute, but may choose some other interpretation,\nso long as it is within the bounds of the reasonable, and\nmay later change to some other interpretation that is\nwithin the bounds of the reasonable. See Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837 (1984). Courts, by contrast, must give the statute its\nsingle, most plausible, reading. To describe this as an\nexercise of \u201cdelegated lawmaking authority\u201d seems to me\npeculiar\u2014unless one believes in lawmakers who have no\ndiscretion. Courts must apply judgment, to be sure. But\njudgment is not discretion.\n   Even if I agreed with the Court\u2019s interpretation of\n\u201cstrong inference,\u201d I would not join the Court\u2019s opinion\nbecause of its frequent indulgence in the last remaining\nlegal fiction of the West: that the report of a single com\nmittee of a single House expresses the will of Congress.\nThe Court says, for example, that \u201cCongress\u2019[s] purpose\u201d\nwas \u201cto promote greater uniformity among the Circuits,\u201d\nante, at 10, relying for that certitude upon the statement\n                Cite as: 551 U.

S. C. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2). I further agree that the case\nshould be remanded to allow the lower courts to decide in\nthe first instance whether the allegations survive under\nthe correct standard. In two respects, however, I disagree\nwith the opinion of the Court. First, the best interpreta\ntion of the statute is that only those facts that are alleged\n\u201cwith particularity\u201d may properly be considered in deter\nmining whether the allegations of scienter are sufficient.\nSecond, I agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that a \u201cstrong infer\nence\u201d of scienter, in the present context, means an infer\nence that is more likely than not correct.\n                              I\n  On the first point, the statutory language is quite clear.\nSection 78u\u20134(b)(2) states that \u201cthe complaint shall, with\nrespect to each act or omission alleged to violate this\nchapter, state with particularity facts giving rise to a\nstrong inference that the defendant acted with the re\nquired state of mind.\u201d Thus, \u201ca strong inference\u201d of sci\n2      TELLABS, INC. v. MAKOR ISSUES & RIGHTS, LTD.\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nenter must arise from those facts that are stated \u201cwith\nparticularity.\u201d It follows that facts not stated with the\nrequisite particularity cannot be considered in determin\ning whether the strong-inference test is met.\n   In dicta, however, the Court states that \u201comissions and\nambiguities\u201d merely \u201ccount against\u201d inferring scienter,\nand that a court should consider all allegations of scienter,\neven nonparticularized ones, when considering whether a\ncomplaint meets the \u201cstrong inference\u201d requirement. Ante,\nat 14. Not only does this interpretation contradict the\nclear statutory language on this point, but it undermines\nthe particularity requirement\u2019s purpose of preventing a\nplaintiff from using vague or general allegations in order\nto get by a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\nAllowing a plaintiff to derive benefit from such allegations\nwould permit him to circumvent this important provision.\n   Furthermore, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the particu\nlarity requirement in no way distinguishes it from normal\npleading review, under which a court naturally gives less\nweight to allegations containing \u201comissions and ambigui\nties\u201d and more weight to allegations stating particularized\nfacts. The particularity requirement is thus stripped of all\nmeaning.\n   Questions certainly may arise as to whether certain\nallegations meet the statutory particularity requirement,\nbut where that requirement is violated, the offending\nallegations cannot be taken into account.\n                             II\n  I would also hold that a \u201cstrong inference that the de\nfendant acted with the required state of mind\u201d is an infer\nence that is stronger than the inference that the defendant\nlacked the required state of mind. Congress has provided\nvery little guidance regarding the meaning of \u201cstrong\ninference,\u201d and the difference between the Court\u2019s inter\npretation (the inference of scienter must be at least as\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

The two ap\nproaches are similar in that they both regard the critical\nquestion as posing a binary choice (either the facts give\nrise to a \u201cstrong inference\u201d of scienter or they do not). But\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s interpretation would align the pleading\ntest under \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2) with the test that is used at the\nsummary-judgment        and     judgment-as-a-matter-of-law\nstages, whereas the Court\u2019s test would introduce a test\npreviously unknown in civil litigation. It seems more\nlikely that Congress meant to adopt a known quantity and\nthus to adopt JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s approach.\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

It thus implicitly dele\ngated significant lawmaking authority to the Judiciary in\ndetermining how that standard should operate in practice.\nToday the majority crafts a perfectly workable definition\nof the term, but I am persuaded that a different interpre\ntation would be both easier to apply and more consistent\nwith the statute.\n  The basic purpose of the heightened pleading require\nment in the context of securities fraud litigation is to\nprotect defendants from the costs of discovery and trial in\nunmeritorious cases. Because of its intrusive nature,\ndiscovery may also invade the privacy interests of the\ndefendants and their executives. Like citizens suspected\nof having engaged in criminal activity, those defendants\nshould not be required to produce their private effects\nunless there is probable cause to believe them guilty of\nmisconduct. Admittedly, the probable-cause standard is\nnot capable of precise measurement, but it is a concept\nthat is familiar to judges. As a matter of normal English\nusage, its meaning is roughly the same as \u201cstrong infer\nence.\u201d Moreover, it is most unlikely that Congress in\n2           TELLABS, INC. v. MAKOR ISSUES & RIGHTS, LTD.\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntended us to adopt a standard that makes it more difficult\nto commence a civil case than a criminal case.1\n  In addition to the benefit of its grounding in an already\nfamiliar legal concept, using a probable-cause standard\nwould avoid the unnecessary conclusion that \u201cin determin\ning whether the pleaded facts give rise to a \u2018strong\u2019 infer\nence of scienter, the court must take into account plausible\nopposing inferences.\u201d Ante, at 11 (emphasis added). There\nare times when an inference can easily be deemed strong\nwithout any need to weigh competing inferences. For\nexample, if a known drug dealer exits a building immedi\nately after a confirmed drug transaction, carrying a suspi\ncious looking package, a judge could draw a strong infer\nence that the individual was involved in the\naforementioned drug transaction without debating\nwhether the suspect might have been leaving the building\nat that exact time for another unrelated reason.\n  If, using that same methodology, we assume (as we\nmust, see ante, at 11, 14) the truth of the detailed factual\nallegations attributed to 27 different confidential infor\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        meaning of a statute can only be determined on a case by case\nbasis and will, in each case, turn differently on the clarity of the statu\ntory language, its context, and the intent of its drafters. Here, in my\njudgment, a probable-cause standard is more faithful to the intent of\nCongress, as expressed in both the specific pleading requirement and\nthe statute as a whole, than the more defendant-friendly interpretation\nthat JUSTICE SCALIA prefers. He is clearly wrong in concluding that in\ndivining the meaning of this term, we can merely \u201cread the language\nfor what it says,\u201d and that it is susceptible to only one reading. Ante, at\n3 (opinion concurring in judgment). He argues that we \u201cmust be\ncontent to give \u2018strong inference\u2019 its normal meaning,\u201d ibid., and yet the\n\u201cnormal meaning\u201d of a term such as \u201cstrong inference\u201d is surely in the\neye of the beholder. As the Court\u2019s opinion points out, Courts of Ap\npeals have divided on the meaning of the standard, see ante, at 2, 10,\nand today, the Members of this Court have done the same. Although\nJUSTICE SCALIA may disagree with the Court\u2019s reading of the term, he\nshould at least acknowledge that, in this case, the term itself is open to\ninterpretation.\n                     Cite as: 551 U.

See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142888\"><a href=\"/opinion/142888/dura-pharmaceuticals-inc-v-broudo/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 345, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005); <i>J.I.

Private securities fraud actions, however, if not adequately contained, can be employed abusively to impose substantial costs on companies and individuals whose conduct conforms to the law. See <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v. Dabit,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145671\"><a href=\"/opinion/145671/merrill-lynch-pierce-fenner-smith-inc-v-dabit/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 81, 126 S.Ct. 1503, 164 L.Ed.2d 179 (2006). As a check against abusive litigation by private parties, Congress enacted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 109 Stat. 737.</p>\n<p>Exacting pleading requirements are among the control measures Congress included in the PSLRA. The Act requires plaintiffs to state with particularity both the facts constituting the alleged violation, and the facts evidencing scienter, <i>i.e.,</i> the defendant's intention \"to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109420\"><a href=\"/opinion/109420/ernst-ernst-v-hochfelder/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 194, and n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976); see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(1),(2). This case concerns the latter requirement. As set out in \u00a7 21D(b)(2) of the PSLRA, plaintiffs must \"state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2).</p>\n<p>Congress left the key term \"strong inference\" undefined, and Courts of Appeals have divided on its meaning. In the case before us, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the \"strong inference\" standard would be met if the complaint \"allege[d] facts from which, if true, a reasonable person could infer that the defendant acted with the required intent.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793282\"><a href=\"/opinion/793282/makor-issues-rights-ltd-v-tellabs-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 602 (2006). That formulation, we conclude, does not capture the stricter demand Congress sought to convey in \u00a7 21D(b)(2). It does not suffice that a reasonable factfinder plausibly could infer from the complaint's allegations the requisite state of mind. Rather, to determine whether a complaint's scienter allegations can survive threshold inspection for sufficiency, a court governed by \u00a7 21D(b)(2) must engage in a comparative evaluation; it must consider, not only inferences urged by the plaintiff, as the Seventh Circuit did, but also competing inferences rationally drawn from the facts alleged. An inference of fraudulent intent may be plausible, yet less cogent than other, nonculpable explanations for the defendant's conduct. To qualify as \"strong\" within the intendment of \u00a7 21D(b)(2), we hold, an inference of scienter must be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2505</span> more than merely plausible or reasonable\u0097 it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Tellabs, Inc., manufactures specialized equipment used in fiber optic networks. During the time period relevant to this case, petitioner Richard Notebaert was Tellabs' chief executive officer and president. Respondents (Shareholders) are persons who purchased Tellabs stock between December 11, 2000, and June 19, 2001. They accuse Tellabs and Notebaert (as well as several other Tellabs executives) of engaging in a scheme to deceive the investing public about the true value of Tellabs' stock. See 437 F.3d, at 591; App. 94-98.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Beginning on December 11, 2000, the Shareholders allege, Notebaert (and by imputation Tellabs) \"falsely reassured public investors, in a series of statements ... that Tellabs was continuing to enjoy strong demand for its products and earning record revenues,\" when, in fact, Notebaert knew the opposite was true. <i>Id.,</i> at 94-95, 98. From December 2000 until the spring of 2001, the Shareholders claim, Notebaert knowingly misled the public in four ways. 437 F.3d, at 596. First, he made statements indicating that demand for Tellabs' flagship networking device, the TITAN 5500, was continuing to grow, when in fact demand for that product was waning. <i>Id.,</i> at 596, 597. Second, Notebaert made statements indicating that the TITAN 6500, Tellabs' next-generation networking device, was available for delivery, and that demand for that product was strong and growing, when in truth the product was not ready for delivery and demand was weak. <i>Id.,</i> at 596, 597-598. Third, he falsely represented Tellabs' financial results for the fourth quarter of 2000 (and, in connection with those results, condoned the practice of \"channel stuffing,\" under which Tellabs flooded its customers with unwanted products). <i>Id.,</i> at 596, 598. Fourth, Notebaert made a series of overstated revenue projections, when demand for the TITAN 5500 was drying up and production of the TITAN 6500 was behind schedule. <i>Id.,</i> at 596, 598-599. Based on Notebaert's sunny assessments, the Shareholders contend, market analysts recommended that investors buy Tellabs' stock. See <i>id.,</i> at 592.</p>\n<p>The first public glimmer that business was not so healthy came in March 2001 when Tellabs modestly reduced its first quarter sales projections. <i>Ibid.</i> In the next months, Tellabs made progressively more cautious statements about its projected sales. On June 19, 2001, the last day of the class period, Tellabs disclosed that demand for the TITAN 5500 had significantly dropped. <i>Id.,</i> at 593. Simultaneously, the company substantially lowered its revenue projections for the second quarter of 2001. The next day, the price of Tellabs stock, which had reached a high of $67 during the period, plunged to a low of $15.87. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>On December 3, 2002, the Shareholders filed a class action in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. <i>Ibid.</i> Their complaint stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that Tellabs and Notebaert had engaged in securities fraud in violation of \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2506</span> 891, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5 (2006), also that Notebaert was a \"controlling person\" under \u00a7 20(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), and therefore derivatively liable for the company's fraudulent acts. See App. 98-101, 167-171. Tellabs moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Shareholders had failed to plead their case with the particularity the PSLRA requires. The District Court agreed, and therefore dismissed the complaint without prejudice. App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a-117a; see <i>Johnson v. Tellabs, Inc.,</i> 303 F.Supp.2d 941, 945 (N.D.Ill.2004).</p>\n<p>The Shareholders then amended their complaint, adding references to 27 confidential sources and making further, more specific, allegations concerning Notebaert's mental state. See 437 F.3d, at 594; App. 91-93, 152-160. The District Court again dismissed, this time with prejudice. 303 F.Supp.2d, at 971. The Shareholders had sufficiently pleaded that Notebaert's statements were misleading, the court determined, <i>id.,</i> at 955-961, but they had insufficiently alleged that he acted with scienter, <i>id.,</i> at 954-955, 961-969.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed in relevant part. 437 F.3d, at 591. Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals found that the Shareholders had pleaded the misleading character of Notebaert's statements with sufficient particularity. <i>Id.,</i> at 595-600. Unlike the District Court, however, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the Shareholders had sufficiently alleged that Notebaert acted with the requisite state of mind. <i>Id.,</i> at 603-605.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals recognized that the PSLRA \"unequivocally raise[d] the bar for pleading scienter\" by requiring plaintiffs to \"plea[d] sufficient facts to create a strong inference of scienter.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 601 (internal quotation marks omitted). In evaluating whether that pleading standard is met, the Seventh Circuit said, \"courts [should] examine all of the allegations in the complaint and then ... decide whether collectively they establish such an inference.\" <i>Ibid.</i> \"[W]e will allow the complaint to survive,\" the court next and critically stated, \"if it alleges facts from which, if true, a reasonable person could infer that the defendant acted with the required intent .... If a reasonable person could not draw such an inference from the alleged facts, the defendants are entitled to dismissal.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 602.</p>\n<p>In adopting its standard for the survival of a complaint, the Seventh Circuit explicitly rejected a stiffer standard adopted by the Sixth Circuit, <i>i.e.,</i> that \"plaintiffs are entitled only to the most plausible of competing inferences.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 601, 602 (quoting <i>Fidel v. Farley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788631\"><a href=\"/opinion/788631/bernard-fidel-reich-tang-asset-management-lp-stanl/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 227 (C.A.6 2004)). The Sixth Circuit's standard, the court observed, because it involved an assessment of competing inferences, \"could potentially infringe upon plaintiffs' Seventh Amendment rights.\" 437 F.3d, at 602. We granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement among the Circuits on whether, and to what extent, a court must consider competing inferences in determining whether a securities fraud complaint gives rise to a \"strong inference\" of scienter.<sup>[2]</sup> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 853, 166 L.Ed.2d 681 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2507</span> II</h2>\n<p>Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 forbids the \"use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security ..., [of] any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b). SEC Rule 10b-5 implements \u00a7 10(b) by declaring it unlawful:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made ... not misleading, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\" 17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5.</blockquote>\n<p>Section 10(b), this Court has implied from the statute's text and purpose, affords a right of action to purchasers or sellers of securities injured by its violation.

See also <i>id.,</i> at 345, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (\"The securities statutes seek to maintain public confidence in the marketplace .... by deterring fraud, in part, through the availability of private securities fraud actions.\"); <i>Borak,</i> 377 U.S., at 432, 84 S.Ct. 1555 (private securities fraud actions provide \"a most effective weapon in the enforcement\" of securities laws and are \"a necessary supplement to Commission action\"). To establish liability under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a private plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with scienter, \"a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst,</i> 425 U.S., at 193-194, and n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In an ordinary civil action, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require only \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.

Although the rule encourages brevity, the complaint must say enough to give the defendant \"fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\" <i>Dura Pharmaceuticals,</i> 544 U.S., at 346, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (internal quotation marks omitted). Prior to the enactment of the PSLRA, the sufficiency of a complaint for securities fraud was governed not by Rule 8, but by the heightened pleading standard set forth in Rule 9(b). See <i>Greenstone v. Cambex Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590895\"><a href=\"/opinion/590895/amy-greenstone-and-all-others-similarly-situated-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 25 (C.A.1 1992) (Breyer, J.) (collecting cases). Rule 9(b) applies to \"all averments of fraud or mistake\"; it requires that \"the circumstances constituting fraud ... be stated with particularity\" but provides that \"[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person, may be averred generally.\"</p>\n<p>Courts of Appeals diverged on the character of the Rule 9(b) inquiry in \u00a7 10(b) cases: Could securities fraud plaintiffs allege the requisite mental state \"simply by stating that scienter existed,\" <i>In re GlenFed, Inc. Securities Litigation,</i> 42 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2508</span> 1541, 1546-1547 (C.A.9 1994) (en banc), or were they required to allege with particularity facts giving rise to an inference of scienter? Compare <i>id.,</i> at 1546 (\"We are not permitted to add new requirements to Rule 9(b) simply because we like the effects of doing so.\"), with, <i>e.g., </i><i>Greenstone,</i> 975 F.2d, at 25 (were the law to permit a securities fraud complaint simply to allege scienter without supporting facts, \"a complaint could evade too easily the `particularity' requirement in Rule 9(b)'s first sentence\"). Circuits requiring plaintiffs to allege specific facts indicating scienter expressed that requirement variously. See 5A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1301.1, pp. 300-302 (3d ed.2004) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller). The Second Circuit's formulation was the most stringent. Securities fraud plaintiffs in that Circuit were required to \"specifically plead those [facts] which they assert give rise to a <i>strong inference</i> that the defendants had\" the requisite state of mind. <i>Ross v. A.H.

Conf. Rep. No. 104-369, p. 31 (1995), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1995, p. 730 (hereinafter H.R. Conf. Rep.))\u0097the PSLRA installed both substantive and procedural controls.<sup>[4]</sup> Notably, Congress prescribed new procedures for the appointment of lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. This innovation aimed to increase the likelihood that institutional investors\u0097parties more likely to balance the interests of the class with the long-term interests of the company\u0097 would serve as lead plaintiffs. See <i>id.,</i> at 33-34; S.Rep. No. 104-98, p. 11 (1995), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1995, pp. 679, 690. Congress also \"limit[ed] recoverable damages and attorney's fees, provide[d] a `safe harbor' for forward-looking statements, ... mandate[d] imposition of sanctions for frivolous litigation, and authorize[d] a stay of discovery pending resolution of any motion to dismiss.\" <i>Dabit,</i> 547 U.S., at 81, 126 S.Ct. 1503. And in \u00a7 21D(b) of the PSLRA, Congress \"impose[d] heightened pleading requirements in actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Under the PSLRA's heightened pleading instructions, any private securities complaint alleging that the defendant made a false or misleading statement must: (1) \"specify each statement alleged to have been misleading [and] the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(1); and (2) \"state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind,\" \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). In the instant case, as earlier stated, see <i>supra,</i> at 2506, the District Court and the Seventh Circuit agreed that the Shareholders met the first of the two requirements: The complaint sufficiently <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2509</span> specified Notebaert's alleged misleading statements and the reasons why the statements were misleading. 303 F.Supp.2d, at 955-961, 437 F.3d, at 596-600. But those courts disagreed on whether the Shareholders, as required by \u00a7 21D(b)(2), \"state[d] with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that [Notebaert] acted with [scienter],\" \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). See <i>supra,</i> at 2506.</p>\n<p>The \"strong inference\" standard \"unequivocally raise[d] the bar for pleading scienter,\" 437 F.3d, at 601, and signaled Congress' purpose to promote greater uniformity among the Circuits, see H.R. Conf. Rep., p. 41. But \"Congress did not ... throw much light on what facts ... suffice to create [a strong] inference,\" or on what \"degree of imagination courts can use in divining whether\" the requisite inference exists. 437 F.3d, at 601. While adopting the Second Circuit's \"strong inference\" standard, Congress did not codify that Circuit's case law interpreting the standard. See \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). See also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 18. With no clear guide from Congress other than its \"inten[tion] to strengthen existing pleading requirements,\" H.R. Conf. Rep., p. 41, Courts of Appeals have diverged again, this time in construing the term \"strong inference.\" Among the uncertainties, should courts consider competing inferences in determining whether an inference of scienter is \"strong\"? See 437 F.3d, at 601-602 (collecting cases). Our task is to prescribe a workable construction of the \"strong inference\" standard, a reading geared to the PSLRA's twin goals: to curb frivolous, lawyer-driven litigation, while preserving investors' ability to recover on meritorious claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We establish the following prescriptions: <i>First,</i> faced with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a \u00a7 10(b) action, courts must, as with any motion to dismiss for failure to plead a claim on which relief can be granted, accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true. See <i>Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112825\"><a href=\"/opinion/112825/leatherman-v-tarrant-county-narcotics-intelligence/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span>, 164, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993). On this point, the parties agree. See Reply Brief 8; Brief for Respondents 26; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 8, 20, 21.</p>\n<p><i>Second,</i> courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice. See 5B Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 1357 (3d ed.2004 and Supp.2007). The inquiry, as several Courts of Appeals have recognized, is whether <i>all</i> of the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter, not whether any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation, meets that standard. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Abrams v. Baker Hughes Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"27571\"><a href=\"/opinion/27571/abrams-et-al-v-baker-hughes-inc-et-al/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 431 (C.A.5 2002); <i>Gompper v. VISX, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778587\"><a href=\"/opinion/778587/john-w-gompper-jr-and-esther-sefaradi-john-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span>, 897 (C.A.9 2002). See also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 25.</p>\n<p><i>Third,</i> in determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a \"strong\" inference of scienter, the court must take into account plausible opposing inferences. The Seventh Circuit expressly declined to engage in such a comparative inquiry. A complaint could survive, that court said, as long as it \"alleges facts from which, if true, a reasonable person could infer that the defendant acted with the required intent\"; in other words, only \"[i]f a reasonable person could not draw such an inference from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2510</span> the alleged facts\" would the defendant prevail on a motion to dismiss. 437 F.3d, at 602. But in \u00a7 21D(b)(2), Congress did not merely require plaintiffs to \"provide a factual basis for [their] scienter allegations,\" <i>ibid.</i> (quoting <i>In re Cerner Corp. Securities Litigation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792151\"><a href=\"/opinion/792151/in-re-cerner-corp-securities-litigation-john-a-cam/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span>, 1084, 1085 (C.A.8 2005)), <i>i.e.,</i> to allege facts from which an inference of scienter rationally <i>could</i> be drawn. Instead, Congress required plaintiffs to plead with particularity facts that give rise to a \"strong\"\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> a powerful or cogent\u0097inference. See American Heritage Dictionary 1717 (4th ed.2000) (defining \"strong\" as \"[p]ersuasive, effective, and cogent\"); 16 Oxford English Dictionary 949 (2d ed.1989) (defining \"strong\" as \"[p]owerful to demonstrate or convince\" (definition 16b)); cf. 7 <i>id.,</i> at 924 (defining \"inference\" as \"a conclusion [drawn] from known or assumed facts or statements\"; \"reasoning from something known or assumed to something else which follows from it\").</p>\n<p>The strength of an inference cannot be decided in a vacuum. The inquiry is inherently comparative: How likely is it that one conclusion, as compared to others, follows from the underlying facts? To determine whether the plaintiff has alleged facts that give rise to the requisite \"strong inference\" of scienter, a court must consider plausible nonculpable explanations for the defendant's conduct, as well as inferences favoring the plaintiff. The inference that the defendant acted with scienter need not be irrefutable, <i>i.e.,</i> of the \"smoking-gun\" genre, or even the \"most plausible of competing inferences,\" <i>Fidel,</i> 392 F.3d, at 227 (quoting <i>Helwig v. Vencor, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773420\"><a href=\"/opinion/773420/a-carl-helwig-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>, 553 (C.A.6 2001) (en banc)). Recall in this regard that \u00a7 21D(b)'s pleading requirements are but one constraint among many the PSLRA installed to screen out frivolous suits, while allowing meritorious actions to move forward. See <i>supra,</i> at 2508, and n. 4. Yet the inference of scienter must be more than merely \"reasonable\" or \"permissible\"\u0097it must be cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other explanations. A complaint will survive, we hold, only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2511</span> B</h2>\n<p>Tellabs contends that when competing inferences are considered, Notebaert's evident lack of pecuniary motive will be dispositive. The Shareholders, Tellabs stresses, did not allege that Notebaert sold any shares during the class period. See Brief for Petitioners 50 (\"The absence of any allegations of motive color all the other allegations putatively giving rise to an inference of scienter.\"). While it is true that motive can be a relevant consideration, and personal financial gain may weigh heavily in favor of a scienter inference, we agree with the Seventh Circuit that the absence of a motive allegation is not fatal. See 437 F.3d, at 601. As earlier stated, <i>supra,</i> at 2509-2510, allegations must be considered collectively; the significance that can be ascribed to an allegation of motive, or lack thereof, depends on the entirety of the complaint.</p>\n<p>Tellabs also maintains that several of the Shareholders' allegations are too vague or ambiguous to contribute to a strong inference of scienter. For example, the Shareholders alleged that Tellabs flooded its customers with unwanted products, a practice known as \"channel stuffing.\" See <i>supra,</i> at 2505. But they failed, Tellabs argues, to specify whether the channel stuffing allegedly known to Notebaert was the illegitimate kind (<i>e.g.,</i> writing orders for products customers had not requested) or the legitimate kind (<i>e.g.,</i> offering customers discounts as an incentive to buy). Brief for Petitioners 44-46; Reply Brief 8. See also <i>id.,</i> at 8-9 (complaint lacks precise dates of reports critical to distinguish legitimate conduct from culpable conduct). But see 437 F.3d, at 598, 603-604 (pointing to multiple particulars alleged by the Shareholders, including specifications as to timing). We agree that omissions and ambiguities count against inferring scienter, for plaintiffs must \"state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). We reiterate, however, that the court's job is not to scrutinize each allegation in isolation but to assess all the allegations holistically. See <i>supra,</i> at 2509-2510; 437 F.3d, at 601. In sum, the reviewing court must ask: When the allegations are accepted as true and taken collectively, would a reasonable person deem the inference of scienter at least as strong as any opposing inference?<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Accounting for its construction of \u00a7 21D(b)(2), the Seventh Circuit explained that the court \"th[ought] it wis[e] to adopt an approach that [could not] be misunderstood as a usurpation of the jury's role.\" 437 F.3d, at 602. In our view, the Seventh Circuit's concern was undue.<sup>[7]</sup> A court's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2512</span> comparative assessment of plausible inferences, while constantly assuming the plaintiff's allegations to be true, we think it plain, does not impinge upon the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Congress, as creator of federal statutory claims, has power to prescribe what must be pleaded to state the claim, just as it has power to determine what must be proved to prevail on the merits. It is the federal lawmaker's prerogative, therefore, to allow, disallow, or shape the contours of\u0097 including the pleading and proof requirements for\u0097 \u00a7 10(b) private actions. No decision of this Court questions that authority in general, or suggests, in particular, that the Seventh Amendment inhibits Congress from establishing whatever pleading requirements it finds appropriate for federal statutory claims. Cf. <i>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118482\"><a href=\"/opinion/118482/swierkiewicz-v-sorema-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 512-513, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002); <i>Leatherman,</i> 507 U.S., at 168, 113 S.Ct. 1160 (both recognizing that heightened pleading requirements can be established by Federal Rule, citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9(b), which requires that fraud or mistake be pleaded with particularity).<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Md. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95734\"><a href=\"/opinion/95734/fidelity-deposit-co-of-md-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 23 S.Ct. 120, 47 L.Ed. 194 (1902), is instructive. That case concerned a rule adopted by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia in 1879 pursuant to rulemaking power delegated by Congress. The rule required defendants, in certain contract actions, to file an affidavit \"specifically stating ..., in precise and distinct terms, the grounds of his defen[s]e.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 318, 23 S.Ct. 120 (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant's affidavit was found insufficient, and judgment was entered for the plaintiff, whose declaration and supporting affidavit had been found satisfactory. <i>Ibid.</i> This Court upheld the District's rule against the contention that it violated the Seventh Amendment. <i>Id.,</i> at 320, 23 S.Ct. 120. Just as the purpose of \u00a7 21D(b) is to screen out frivolous complaints, the purpose of the prescription at issue in <i>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co.</i> was to \"preserve the courts from frivolous defen[s]es,\" <i>ibid.</i> Explaining why the Seventh Amendment was not implicated, this Court said that the heightened pleading rule simply \"prescribes the means of making an issue,\" and that, when \"[t]he issue [was] made as prescribed, the right of trial by jury accrues.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> accord <i>Ex parte Peterson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99615\"><a href=\"/opinion/99615/ex-parte-peterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 310, 40 S.Ct. 543, 64 L.Ed. 919 (1920) (Brandeis, J.) (citing <i>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co.,</i> and reiterating: \"It does not infringe the constitutional right to a trial by jury [in a civil case], to require, with a view to formulating the issues, an oath by each party to the facts relied upon.\"). See also <i>Walker v. New Mexico &amp; Southern Pacific R. Co.,</i> 165 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2513</span> U.S. 593, 596, 17 S.Ct. 421, 41 L.Ed. 837 (1897) (Seventh Amendment \"does not attempt to regulate matters of pleading\").</p>\n<p>In the instant case, provided that the Shareholders have satisfied the congressionally \"prescribe[d] ... means of making an issue,\" <i>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co.,</i> 187 U.S., at 320, 23 S.Ct. 120, the case will fall within the jury's authority to assess the credibility of witnesses, resolve any genuine issues of fact, and make the ultimate determination whether Notebaert and, by imputation, Tellabs acted with scienter. We emphasize, as well, that under our construction of the \"strong inference\" standard, a plaintiff is not forced to plead more than she would be required to prove at trial. A plaintiff alleging fraud in a \u00a7 10(b) action, we hold today, must plead facts rendering an inference of scienter <i>at least as likely as</i> any plausible opposing inference. At trial, she must then prove her case by a \"preponderance of the evidence.\" Stated otherwise, she must demonstrate that it is <i>more likely</i> than not that the defendant acted with scienter. See <i>Herman &amp; MacLean v. Huddleston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110825\"><a href=\"/opinion/110825/herman-maclean-v-huddleston/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, 390, 103 S.Ct. 683, 74 L.Ed.2d 548 (1983).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>While we reject the Seventh Circuit's approach to \u00a7 21D(b)(2), we do not decide whether, under the standard we have described, see <i>supra,</i> at 2509-2511, the Shareholders' allegations warrant \"a strong inference that [Notebaert and Tellabs] acted with the required state of mind,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals had the opportunity to consider the matter in light of the prescriptions we announce today. We therefore vacate the Seventh Circuit's judgment so that the case may be reexamined in accord with our construction of \u00a7 21D(b)(2).</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I fail to see how an inference that is merely \"at least as compelling as any opposing inference,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2505, can conceivably be called what the statute here at issue requires: a \"strong inference,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). If a jade falcon were stolen from a room to which only A and B had access, could it <i>possibly</i> be said there was a \"strong inference\" that B was the thief? I think not, and I therefore think that the Court's test must fail. In my view, the test should be whether the inference of scienter (if any) is <i>more plausible</i> than the inference of innocence.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court's explicit rejection of this reading, <i>ante,</i> at 2510, rests on two assertions. The first (doubtless true) is that the statute does not require that \"[t]he inference that the defendant acted with scienter... be irrefutable, <i>i.e.,</i> of the `smoking-gun' genre,\" <i>ibid.</i> It is up to Congress, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2514</span> however, and not to us, to determine what pleading standard would avoid those extremities while yet effectively deterring baseless actions. Congress has expressed its determination in the phrase \"strong inference\"; it is our job to give that phrase its normal meaning. And if we are to abandon text in favor of unexpressed purpose, as the Court does, it is inconceivable that Congress's enactment of stringent pleading requirements in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 somehow manifests the purpose of giving plaintiffs the edge in close cases.</p>\n<p>The Court's second assertion (also true) is that \"an inference at least as likely as competing inferences can, in some cases, warrant recovery.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2510, n. 5 (citing <i>Summers v. Tice,</i> 33 Cal.2d 80, 84-87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1184099\"><a href=\"/opinion/1184099/summers-v-tice/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3-5 (1948) (in bank)). <i>Summers</i> is a famous case, however, because it sticks out of the ordinary body of tort law like a sore thumb. It represented \"a relaxation\" of \"such proof as is ordinarily required\" to succeed in a negligence action. <i>Id.,</i> at 86, 199 P.2d, at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted). There is no indication that the statute at issue here was meant to relax the ordinary rule under which a tie goes to the defendant. To the contrary, it explicitly strengthens that rule by extending it to the pleading stage of a case.</p>\n<p>One of petitioners' <i>amici</i> suggests that my reading of the statute would transform the text from requiring a \"strong\" inference to requiring the \"strongest\" inference. See Brief for American Association for Justice as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27. The point might have some force if Congress could have more clearly adopted my standard by using the word \"strongest\" instead of the word \"strong.\" But the use of the superlative would not have made any sense given the provision's structure: What does it mean to require a plaintiff to plead \"facts giving rise to <i>the strongest</i> inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind\"? It is certainly true that, if Congress had wanted to adopt my standard with even greater clarity, it could have restructured the entire provision\u0097to require, for example, that the plaintiff plead \"facts giving rise to <i>an inference of scienter that is more compelling than the inference that the defendant acted with a nonculpable state of mind.</i>\" But if one is to consider the possibility of total restructuring, it is equally true that, to express the Court's standard, Congress could have demanded <i>\"an inference of scienter that is at least as compelling as the inference that the defendant acted with a nonculpable state of mind.\"</i> Argument from the possibility of saying it differently is clearly a draw. We must be content to give \"strong inference\" its normal meaning. I hasten to add that, while precision of interpretation should always be pursued for its own sake, I doubt that in this instance what I deem to be the correct test will produce results much different from the Court's. How often is it that inferences are precisely in equipoise? All the more reason, I think, to read the language for what it says.</p>\n<p>The Court and the dissent criticize me for suggesting that there is only one reading of the text. <i>Ante,</i> at 2510-2511, n. 5; <i>post,</i> at 2517, n. 1 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). They are both mistaken. I assert only that mine is the natural reading of the statute (<i>i.e.,</i> the normal reading), not that it is the only conceivable one. The Court has no standing to object to this approach, since it concludes that, in another respect, the statute admits of only one natural reading, namely, that competing inferences must be weighed because the strong-inference requirement \"is inherently comparative\" <i>ante,</i> at 2510. As for the dissent, it asserts that the statute cannot possibly have a natural and discernible meaning, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2515</span> since \"courts of appeals\" and \"Members of this Court\" \"have divided\" over the question. It was just weeks ago, however, that the author of the dissent, joined by the author of today's opinion for the Court, concluded that a statute's meaning was \"plain,\" <i>Rockwell Int'l Corp. v. United States,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1397, 1412, 167 L.Ed.2d 190 (2007) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), even though the Courts of Appeals and Members of this Court divided over the question, <i>id.,</i> at ___, n. 5 (127 S.Ct., at 1407, n. 5). Was plain meaning then, as the dissent claims it is today, <i>post,</i> at 2517, n. 1, \"in the eye of the beholder\"?</p>\n<p>It is unremarkable that various Justices in this case reach different conclusions about the correct interpretation of the statutory text. It is remarkable, however, that the dissent believes that Congress \"implicitly delegated significant lawmaking authority to the Judiciary in determining how th[e] [strong-inference] standard should operate in practice.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2516-2517. This is language usually employed to describe the discretion conferred upon administrative agencies, which need not adopt what courts would consider the interpretation most faithful to the text of the statute, but may choose some other interpretation, so long as it is within the bounds of the reasonable, and may later change to some <i>other</i> interpretation that is within the bounds of the reasonable. See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Courts, by contrast, <i>must</i> give the statute its single, most plausible, reading. To describe this as an exercise of \"delegated lawmaking authority\" seems to me peculiar\u0097unless one believes in lawmakers who have no discretion. Courts must apply judgment, to be sure. But judgment is not discretion.</p>\n<p>Even if I agreed with the Court's interpretation of \"strong inference,\" I would not join the Court's opinion because of its frequent indulgence in the last remaining legal fiction of the West: that the report of a single committee of a single House expresses the will of Congress. The Court says, for example, that \"Congress'[s] purpose\" was \"to promote greater uniformity among the Circuits,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2509, relying for that certitude upon the statement of managers accompanying a House Conference Committee Report whose text was never adopted by the House, much less by the Senate, and as far as we know was read by almost no one. The Court is sure that Congress \"`inten[ded] to strengthen existing pleading requirements,'\" <i>ibid.,</i> because\u0097again\u0097the statement of managers said so. I come to the same conclusion for the much safer reason that the law which Congress adopted (and which the Members of both Houses actually <i>voted</i> on) so indicates. And had the legislation not done so, the statement of managers assuredly could not have remedied the deficiency.</p>\n<p>With the above exceptions, I am generally in agreement with the Court's analysis, and so concur in its judgment.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that the Seventh Circuit used an erroneously low standard for determining whether the plaintiffs in this case satisfied their burden of pleading \"with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). I further agree that the case should be remanded to allow the lower courts to decide in the first instance whether the allegations survive under the correct standard. In two respects, however, I disagree with the opinion of the Court. First, the best interpretation of the statute is that only those facts that are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2516</span> alleged \"with particularity\" may properly be considered in determining whether the allegations of scienter are sufficient. Second, I agree with Justice SCALIA that a \"strong inference\" of scienter, in the present context, means an inference that is more likely than not correct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On the first point, the statutory language is quite clear. Section 78u-4(b)(2) states that \"the complaint shall, with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" Thus, \"a strong inference\" of scienter must arise from those facts that are stated \"with particularity.\" It follows that facts not stated with the requisite particularity cannot be considered in determining whether the strong-inference test is met.</p>\n<p>In dicta, however, the Court states that \"omissions and ambiguities\" merely \"count against\" inferring scienter, and that a court should consider all allegations of scienter, even nonparticularized ones, when considering whether a complaint meets the \"strong inference\" requirement. <i>Ante,</i> at 2511. Not only does this interpretation contradict the clear statutory language on this point, but it undermines the particularity requirement's purpose of preventing a plaintiff from using vague or general allegations in order to get by a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Allowing a plaintiff to derive benefit from such allegations would permit him to circumvent this important provision.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Court's interpretation of the particularity requirement in no way distinguishes it from normal pleading review, under which a court naturally gives less weight to allegations containing \"omissions and ambiguities\" and more weight to allegations stating particularized facts. The particularity requirement is thus stripped of all meaning.</p>\n<p>Questions certainly may arise as to whether certain allegations meet the statutory particularity requirement, but where that requirement is violated, the offending allegations cannot be taken into account.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>I would also hold that a \"strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind\" is an inference that is stronger than the inference that the defendant lacked the required state of mind. Congress has provided very little guidance regarding the meaning of \"strong inference,\" and the difference between the Court's interpretation (the inference of scienter must be at least as strong as the inference of no scienter) and Justice SCALIA's (the inference of scienter must be at least marginally stronger than the inference of no scienter) is unlikely to make any practical difference. The two approaches are similar in that they both regard the critical question as posing a binary choice (either the facts give rise to a \"strong inference\" of scienter or they do not). But Justice SCALIA's interpretation would align the pleading test under \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2) with the test that is used at the summary-judgment and judgment-as-a-matter-of-law stages, whereas the Court's test would introduce a test previously unknown in civil litigation. It seems more likely that Congress meant to adopt a known quantity and thus to adopt Justice SCALIA's approach.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>As the Court explains, when Congress enacted a heightened pleading requirement for private actions to enforce the federal securities laws, it \"left the key term `strong inference' undefined.\" <i>Ante,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2517</span> at 2504-2505. It thus implicitly delegated significant lawmaking authority to the Judiciary in determining how that standard should operate in practice. Today the majority crafts a perfectly workable definition of the term, but I am persuaded that a different interpretation would be both easier to apply and more consistent with the statute.</p>\n<p>The basic purpose of the heightened pleading requirement in the context of securities fraud litigation is to protect defendants from the costs of discovery and trial in unmeritorious cases. Because of its intrusive nature, discovery may also invade the privacy interests of the defendants and their executives. Like citizens suspected of having engaged in criminal activity, those defendants should not be required to produce their private effects unless there is probable cause to believe them guilty of misconduct. Admittedly, the probable-cause standard is not capable of precise measurement, but it is a concept that is familiar to judges. As a matter of normal English usage, its meaning is roughly the same as \"strong inference.\" Moreover, it is most unlikely that Congress intended us to adopt a standard that makes it more difficult to commence a civil case than a criminal case.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition to the benefit of its grounding in an already familiar legal concept, using a probable-cause standard would avoid the unnecessary conclusion that \"in determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a `strong' inference of scienter, the court <i>must</i> take into account plausible opposing inferences.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2509 (emphasis added). There are times when an inference can easily be deemed strong without any need to weigh competing inferences. For example, if a known drug dealer exits a building immediately after a confirmed drug transaction, carrying a suspicious looking package, a judge could draw a strong inference that the individual was involved in the aforementioned drug transaction without debating whether the suspect might have been leaving the building at that exact time for another unrelated reason.</p>\n<p>If, using that same methodology, we assume (as we must, see <i>ante,</i> at 2509-2510, 2511) the truth of the detailed factual allegations attributed to 27 different confidential informants described in the complaint, App. 91-93, and view those allegations collectively, I think it clear that they establish probable cause to believe that Tellabs' chief executive officer \"acted with the required intent,\" as the Seventh Circuit held.<sup>[2]</sup> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793282\"><a href=\"/opinion/793282/makor-issues-rights-ltd-v-tellabs-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 602 (2006).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2518</span> Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Shareholders brought suit against Tellabs executives other than Notebaert, including Richard Birck, Tellabs' chairman and former chief executive officer.

See <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v.

Every Court of Appeals that has considered the issue has held that a plaintiff may meet the scienter requirement by showing that the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly, though the Circuits differ on the degree of recklessness required. See <i>Ottmann,</i> 353 F.3d, at 343 (collecting cases). The question whether and when recklessness satisfies the scienter requirement is not presented in this case.</p>\n<p>[4]  Nothing in the Act, we have previously noted, casts doubt on the conclusion \"that private securities litigation [i]s an indispensable tool with which defrauded investors can recover their losses\"\u0097a matter crucial to the integrity of domestic capital markets. See <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v. Dabit,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145671\"><a href=\"/opinion/145671/merrill-lynch-pierce-fenner-smith-inc-v-dabit/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 81, 126 S.Ct. 1503, 164 L.Ed.2d 179 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[5]  Justice SCALIA objects to this standard on the ground that \"[i]f a jade falcon were stolen from a room to which only A and B had access,\" it could not \"<i>possibly</i> be said there was a `strong inference' that B was the thief.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2513 (opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis in original). I suspect, however, that law enforcement officials as well as the owner of the precious falcon would find the inference of guilt as to B quite strong\u0097 certainly strong enough to warrant further investigation. Indeed, an inference at least as likely as competing inferences can, in some cases, warrant recovery. See <i>Summers v. Tice,</i> 33 Cal.2d 80, 84-87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1184099\"><a href=\"/opinion/1184099/summers-v-tice/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3-5 (1948) (in bank) (plaintiff wounded by gunshot could recover from two defendants, even though the most he could prove was that each defendant was at least as likely to have injured him as the other); Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 28(b), Comment <i>e,</i> p. 504 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, Apr. 6, 2005) (\"Since the publication of the Second Restatement in 1965, courts have generally accepted the alternative-liability principle of [<i>Summers v. Tice</i><i>,</i> adopted in] \u00a7 433B(3), while fleshing out its limits.\"). In any event, we disagree with Justice SCALIA that the hardly stock term \"strong inference\" has only one invariably right (\"natural\" or \"normal\") reading\u0097 his. See <i>post,</i> at 2514-2515.\n</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO agrees with Justice SCALIA, and would transpose to the pleading stage \"the test that is used at the summary-judgment and judgment-as-a-matter-of-law stages.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2516 (opinion concurring in judgment). But the test at each stage is measured against a different backdrop. It is improbable that Congress, without so stating, intended courts to test pleadings, unaided by discovery, to determine whether there is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact.\" See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c). And judgment as a matter of law is a post-trial device, turning on the question whether a party has produced evidence \"legally sufficient\" to warrant a jury determination in that party's favor. See Rule 50(a)(1).</p>\n<p>[6]  The Seventh Circuit held that allegations of scienter made against one defendant cannot be imputed to all other individual defendants. 437 F.3d, at 602-603. See also <i>id.,</i> at 603 (to proceed beyond the pleading stage, the plaintiff must allege as to each defendant facts sufficient to demonstrate a culpable state of mind regarding his or her violations) (citing <i>Phillips v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76625\"><a href=\"/opinion/76625/scientific-atlanta-inc-v-rochelle-phillips/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></a></span>, 1018 (C.A.11 2004)). Though there is disagreement among the Circuits as to whether the group pleading doctrine survived the PSLRA, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Southland Securities Corp. v. INSpire Ins. Solutions Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785871\"><a href=\"/opinion/785871/southland-securities-corporation-on-behalf-of-itse/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span>, 364 (C.A.5 2004), the Shareholders do not contest the Seventh Circuit's determination, and we do not disturb it.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Seventh Circuit raised the possibility of a Seventh Amendment problem on its own initiative. The Shareholders did not contend below that dismissal of their complaint under \u00a7 21D(b)(2) would violate their right to trial by jury. Cf. <i>Monroe Employees Retirement System v. Bridgestone Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789390\"><a href=\"/opinion/789390/city-of-monroe-employees-retirement-system-on-beha/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 683, n. 25 (C.A.6 2005) (noting possible Seventh Amendment argument but declining to address it when not raised by plaintiffs).</p>\n<p>[8]  In numerous contexts, gatekeeping judicial determinations prevent submission of claims to a jury's judgment without violating the Seventh Amendment. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) (expert testimony can be excluded based on judicial determination of reliability); <i>Neely v.

Rule Civ. Proc. 9(b), could have the effect of preventing a plaintiff from getting discovery on a claim that might have gone to a jury, had discovery occurred and yielded substantial evidence. In recognizing Congress' or the Federal Rule makers' authority to adopt special pleading rules, we have detected no Seventh Amendment impediment.</p>\n<p>[*]  The Court suggests that \"the owner of the precious falcon would find the inference of guilt as to B quite strong.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2510, n. 5. If he should draw such an inference, it would only prove the wisdom of the ancient maxim <i>\"aliquis non debet esse Judex in propria causa\"</i>\u0097no man ought to be a judge of his own cause. <i>Dr. Bonham's Case,</i> 8 Co. 107a, 114a, 118a, 77 Eng. Rep. 638, 646, 652 (C.P. 1610). For it is quite clear (from the dispassionate perspective of one who does not own a jade falcon) that a <i>possibility,</i> even a strong possibility, that B is responsible is not a strong <i>inference</i> that B is responsible. \"Inference\" connotes \"belief\" in what is inferred, and it would be impossible to form a strong belief that it was B and not A, or A and not B.</p>\n<p>[1]  The meaning of a statute can only be determined on a case by case basis and will, in each case, turn differently on the clarity of the statutory language, its context, and the intent of its drafters. Here, in my judgment, a probable-cause standard is more faithful to the intent of Congress, as expressed in both the specific pleading requirement and the statute as a whole, than the more defendant-friendly interpretation that Justice SCALIA prefers. He is clearly wrong in concluding that in divining the meaning of this term, we can merely \"read the language for what it says,\" and that it is susceptible to only one reading. <i>Ante,</i> at 2514 (opinion concurring in judgment). He argues that we \"must be content to give `strong inference' its normal meaning,\" <i>ibid.,</i> and yet the \"normal meaning\" of a term such as \"strong inference\" is surely in the eye of the beholder. As the Court's opinion points out, Courts of Appeals have divided on the meaning of the standard, see <i>ante,</i> at 2504-2505, 2508-2509, and today, the Members of this Court have done the same. Although Justice SCALIA may disagree with the Court's reading of the term, he should at least acknowledge that, in this case, the term itself is open to interpretation.</p>\n<p>[2]  The \"channel stuffing\" allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 62-72 of the amended complaint, App. 110-113, are particularly persuasive. Contrary to petitioners' arguments that respondents' allegations of channel stuffing \"are too vague or ambiguous to contribute to a strong inference of scienter,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2511, this portion of the complaint clearly alleges that Notebaert himself had specific knowledge of illegitimate channel stuffing during the relevant time period. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. 111, \u00b6 67 (\"Defendant Notebaert worked directly with Tellabs' sales personnel to channel stuff SBC\"); <i>id.,</i> at 110-112 (alleging, in describing such channel stuffing, that Tellabs took \"extraordinary\" steps that amounted to \"an abnormal practice in the industry\"; that \"distributors were upset and later returned the inventory\" (and, in the case of Verizon's Chairman, called Tellabs to complain); that customers \"did not want\" products that Tellabs sent and that Tellabs employees wrote purchase orders for; that \"returns were so heavy during January and February 2001 that Tellabs had to lease extra storage space to accommodate all the returns\"; and that Tellabs \"backdat[ed] sales\" that actually took place in 2001 to appear as having occurred in 2000). If these allegations are actually taken as true and viewed in the collective, it is hard to imagine what competing inference could effectively counteract the inference that Notebaert and Tellabs \"`acted with the required state of mind.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2513 (opinion of the Court) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2)).</p>\n\n</div>",
