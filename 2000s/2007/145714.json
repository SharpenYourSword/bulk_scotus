We must decide whether the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal filed after the statutory period but within the period allowed by the District Court's order. We have long and repeatedly held that the time limits for filing a notice of appeal are jurisdictional in nature. Accordingly, we hold that petitioner's untimely noticeeven though filed in reliance upon a District Court's order deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1999, an Ohio jury convicted petitioner Keith Bowles of murder for his involvement in the beating death of Ollie Gipson. The jury sentenced Bowles to 15 years to life imprisonment. Bowles unsuccessfully challenged his conviction and sentence on direct appeal.</p>\n<p>Bowles then filed a federal habeas corpus application on September 5, 2002. On September 9, 2003, the District Court denied Bowles habeas relief. After the entry of final judgment, Bowles had 30 days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A); 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a). He failed to do so. On December 12, 2003, Bowles moved to reopen the period during which he could file his notice of appeal pursuant to Rule 4(a)(6), which allows district courts to extend the filing period for 14 days from the day the district court grants the order to reopen, provided certain conditions are met. See § 2107(c).</p>\n<p>On February 10, 2004, the District Court granted Bowles' motion. But rather than extending the time period by 14 days, as Rule 4(a)(6) and § 2107(c) allow, the District Court inexplicably gave Bowles 17 daysuntil February 27to file his notice of appeal. Bowles filed his notice on February 26within the 17 days allowed by the District Court's order, but after the 14-day period allowed by Rule 4(a)(6) and § 2107(c).</p>\n<p>On appeal, respondent Russell argued that Bowles' notice was untimely and that the Court of Appeals therefore lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The Court of Appeals agreed. It first recognized that this Court has consistently held the requirement of filing a timely notice of appeal is \"mandatory and jurisdictional.\" 432 F.3d 668, 673 (C.A.6 2005) (citing <i>Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill.,</i> 434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978)). The court also noted that courts of appeals have uniformly held that Rule 4(a)(6)'s 180-day period for filing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2363</span> a motion to reopen is also mandatory and not susceptible to equitable modification. 432 F.3d, at 673 (collecting cases). Concluding that \"the fourteen-day period in Rule 4(a)(6) should be treated as strictly as the 180-day period in that same Rule,\" <i>id.,</i> at 676, the Court of Appeals held that it was without jurisdiction. We granted certiorari, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 763, 166 L.Ed.2d 590 (2006), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>According to 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a), parties must file notices of appeal within 30 days of the entry of the judgment being appealed. District courts have limited authority to grant an extension of the 30-day time period. Relevant to this case, if certain conditions are met, district courts have the statutory authority to grant motions to reopen the time for filing an appeal for 14 additional days. § 2107(c). Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure carries § 2107 into practice. In accord with § 2107(c), Rule 4(a)(6) describes the district court's authority to reopen and extend the time for filing a notice of appeal after the lapse of the usual 30 days:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The district court may reopen the time to file an appeal <i>for a period of 14 days after the date when its order to reopen is entered,</i> but only if all the following conditions are satisfied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice of the entry, whichever is earlier;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) the court finds that the moving party was entitled to notice of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed but did not receive the notice from the district court or any party within 21 days after entry; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.\" (Emphasis added.)<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>It is undisputed that the District Court's order in this case purported to reopen the filing period for more than 14 days. Thus, the question before us is whether the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to entertain an appeal filed outside the 14-day window allowed by § 2107(c) but within the longer period granted by the District Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>This Court has long held that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is \"mandatory and jurisdictional.\" <i>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co.,</i> 459 U.S. 56, 61, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) <i>(per curiam)</i> (internal quotation marks omitted);<sup>[2]</sup> accord, <i>Hohn v. United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2364</span> <i>States,</i> 524 U.S. 236, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998); <i>Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co.,</i> 487 U.S. 312, 314-315, 108 S.Ct. 2405, 101 L.Ed.2d 285 (1988); <i>Browder, supra,</i> at 264, 98 S.Ct. 556. Indeed, even prior to the creation of the circuit courts of appeals, this Court regarded statutory limitations on the timing of appeals as limitations on its own jurisdiction. See <i>Scarborough v. Pargoud,</i> 108 U.S. 567, 568, 2 S.Ct. 877, 27 L.Ed. 824 (1883) (\"[T]he writ of error in this case was not brought within the time limited by law, and we have consequently no jurisdiction\"); <i>United States v. Curry,</i> 6 How. 106, 113, 12 L.Ed. 363 (1848) (\"[A]s this appeal has not been prosecuted in the manner directed, within the time limited by the acts of Congress, it must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction\"). Reflecting the consistency of this Court's holdings, the courts of appeals routinely and uniformly dismiss untimely appeals for lack of jurisdiction. See, <i>e.g., Atkins v. Medical Dept. of Augusta Cty. Jail,</i> No. 06-7792, 2007 WL 1048810 (C.A.4, Apr.4, 2007) <i>(per curiam)</i> (unpublished); see also 15A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3901, p. 6 (2d ed. 1992) (\"The rule is well settled that failure to file a timely notice of appeal defeats the jurisdiction of a court of appeals\"). In fact, the author of today's dissent recently reiterated that \"[t]he accepted fact is that some time limits are jurisdictional even though expressed in a separate statutory section from jurisdictional grants, see, <i>e.g.,</i> ... § 2107 (providing that notice of appeal in civil cases must be filed `within thirty days after the entry of such judgment').\" <i>Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co.,</i> 537 U.S. 149, 160, n. 6, 123 S.Ct. 748, 154 L.Ed.2d 653 (2003) (majority opinion of SOUTER, J., joined by STEVENS, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ., <i>inter alios</i>) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Although several of our recent decisions have undertaken to clarify the distinction between claims-processing rules and jurisdictional rules, none of them calls into question our longstanding treatment of statutory time limits for taking an appeal as jurisdictional. Indeed, those decisions have also recognized the jurisdictional significance of the fact that a time limitation is set forth in a statute. In <i>Kontrick v. Ryan,</i> 540 U.S. 443, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004), we held that failure to comply with the time requirement in Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4004 did not affect a court's subject-matter jurisdiction. Critical to our analysis was the fact that \"[n]o statute ... specifies a time limit for filing a complaint objecting to the debtor's discharge.\" 540 U.S., at 448, 124 S.Ct. 906. Rather, the filing deadlines in the Bankruptcy Rules are \"`procedural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business'\" that are \"`not jurisdictional.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 454, 124 S.Ct. 906 (quoting <i>Schacht v. United States,</i> 398 U.S. 58, 64, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970)). Because \"[o]nly Congress may determine a lower federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction,\" 540 U.S., at 452, 124 S.Ct. 906 (citing U.S. Const., Art. III, § 1), it was improper for courts to use \"the term `jurisdictional' to describe emphatic time prescriptions in rules of court,\" 540 U.S., at 454, 124 S.Ct. 906. See also <i>Eberhart v. United States,</i> 546 U.S. 12, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> As a point of contrast, we noted that § 2107 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2365</span> contains the type of statutory time constraints that would limit a court's jurisdiction. 540 U.S., at 453, and n. 8, 124 S.Ct. 906.<sup>[3]</sup> Nor do <i>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp.,</i> 546 U.S. 500, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006), or <i>Scarborough v. Principi,</i> 541 U.S. 401, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004), aid petitioner. In <i>Arbaugh,</i> the statutory limitation was an employee-numerosity requirement, not a time limit. 546 U.S., at 505, 126 S.Ct. 1235. <i>Scarborough,</i> which addressed the availability of attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, concerned \"a mode of relief... ancillary to the judgment of a court\" that already had plenary jurisdiction. 541 U.S., at 413, 124 S.Ct. 1856.</p>\n<p>This Court's treatment of its certiorari jurisdiction also demonstrates the jurisdictional distinction between court-promulgated rules and limits enacted by Congress. According to our Rules, a petition for a writ of certiorari must be filed within 90 days of the entry of the judgment sought to be reviewed. See this Court's Rule 13.1. That 90-day period applies to both civil and criminal cases. But the 90-day period for civil cases derives from both this Court's Rule 13.1 and 28 U.S.C. § 2101(c). We have repeatedly held that this statute-based filing period for civil cases is jurisdictional. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Federal Election Comm'n v. NRA Political Victory Fund,</i> 513 U.S. 88, 90, 115 S.Ct. 537, 130 L.Ed.2d 439 (1994). Indeed, this Court's Rule 13.2 cites § 2101(c) in directing the Clerk not to file any petition \"that is <i>jurisdictionally</i> out of time.\" (Emphasis added.) On the other hand, we have treated the rule-based time limit for criminal cases differently, stating that it may be waived because \"[t]he procedural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business are not jurisdictional and can be relaxed by the Court in the exercise of its discretion ....\" <i>Schacht, supra,</i> at 64, 90 S.Ct. 1555.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Jurisdictional treatment of statutory time limits makes good sense. Within constitutional bounds, Congress decides what cases the federal courts have jurisdiction to consider. Because Congress decides whether federal courts can hear cases at all, it can also determine when, and under what conditions, federal courts can hear them. See <i>Curry,</i> 6 How., at 113, 12 L.Ed. 363. Put another way, the notion of \"`subject-matter'\" jurisdiction obviously extends to \"`classes of cases ... falling within a court's adjudicatory authority,'\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2366</span> <i>Eberhart, supra,</i> at 16, 126 S.Ct. 403 (quoting <i>Kontrick, supra,</i> at 455, 124 S.Ct. 906), but it is no less \"jurisdictional\" when Congress forbids federal courts from adjudicating an otherwise legitimate \"class of cases\" after a certain period has elapsed from final judgment.</p>\n<p>The resolution of this case follows naturally from this reasoning. Like the initial 30-day period for filing a notice of appeal, the limit on how long a district court may reopen that period is set forth in a statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2107(c). Because Congress specifically limited the amount of time by which district courts can extend the notice-of-appeal period in § 2107(c), that limitation is more than a simple \"claim-processing rule.\" As we have long held, when an \"appeal has not been prosecuted in the manner directed, within the time limited by the acts of Congress, it must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\" <i>Curry, supra,</i> at 113. Bowles' failure to file his notice of appeal in accordance with the statute therefore deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction. And because Bowles' error is one of jurisdictional magnitude, he cannot rely on forfeiture or waiver to excuse his lack of compliance with the statute's time limitations. See <i>Arbaugh, supra,</i> at 513-514, 126 S.Ct. 1235.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Bowles contends that we should excuse his untimely filing because he satisfies the \"unique circumstances\" doctrine, which has its roots in <i>Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc.,</i> 371 U.S. 215, 83 S.Ct. 283, 9 L.Ed.2d 261 (1962) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> There, pursuant to then-Rule 73(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a District Court entertained a timely motion to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal. The District Court found the moving party had established a showing of \"excusable neglect,\" as required by the Rule, and granted the motion. The Court of Appeals reversed the finding of excusable neglect and, accordingly, held that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to grant the extension. <i>Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc.,</i> 303 F.2d 609, 611-612 (C.A.7 1962). This Court reversed, noting \"the obvious great hardship to a party who relies upon the trial judge's finding of `excusable neglect.'\" 371 U.S., at 217, 83 S.Ct. 283.</p>\n<p>Today we make clear that the timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement. Because this Court has no authority to create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements, use of the \"unique circumstances\" doctrine is illegitimate. Given that this Court has applied <i>Harris Truck Lines</i> only once in the last half century, <i>Thompson v. INS,</i> 375 U.S. 384, 84 S.Ct. 397, 11 L.Ed.2d 404 (1964) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> several courts have rightly questioned its continuing validity. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Panhorst v. United States,</i> 241 F.3d 367, 371 (C.A.4 2001) (doubting \"the continued viability of the unique circumstances doctrine\"). See also <i>Houston v. Lack,</i> 487 U.S. 266, 282, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"Our later cases... effectively repudiate the <i>Harris Truck Lines</i> approach ...\"). See also <i>Osterneck v. Ernst &amp; Whinney,</i> 489 U.S. 169, 170, 109 S.Ct. 987, 103 L.Ed.2d 146 (1989) (referring to \"the so-called `unique circumstances' exception\" to the timely appeal requirement). We see no compelling reason to resurrect the doctrine from its 40-year slumber. Accordingly, we reject Bowles' reliance on the doctrine, and we overrule <i>Harris Truck Lines</i> and <i>Thompson</i> to the extent they purport to authorize an exception to a jurisdictional rule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2367</span> C</h2>\n<p>If rigorous rules like the one applied today are thought to be inequitable, Congress may authorize courts to promulgate rules that excuse compliance with the statutory time limits. Even narrow rules to this effect would give rise to litigation testing their reach and would no doubt detract from the clarity of the rule. However, congressionally authorized rulemaking would likely lead to less litigation than court-created exceptions without authorization. And in all events, for the reasons discussed above, we lack present authority to make the exception petitioner seeks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Bowles' appeal. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice GINSBURG, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The District Court told petitioner Keith Bowles that his notice of appeal was due on February 27, 2004. He filed a notice of appeal on February 26, only to be told that he was too late because his deadline had actually been February 24. It is intolerable for the judicial system to treat people this way, and there is not even a technical justification for condoning this bait and switch. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>\"`Jurisdiction,'\" we have warned several times in the last decade, \"`is a word of many, too many, meanings.'\" <i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 90, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (quoting <i>United States v. Vanness,</i> 85 F.3d 661, 663, n. 2 (C.A.D.C.1996)); <i>Kontrick v. Ryan,</i> 540 U.S. 443, 454, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004) (quoting <i>Steel Co.</i>); <i>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp.,</i> 546 U.S. 500, 510, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006) (quoting <i>Steel Co.</i>); <i>Rockwell Int'l Corp. v. United States,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1397, 1405, 167 L.Ed.2d 190 (2007) (quoting <i>Steel Co.</i>). This variety of meaning has insidiously tempted courts, this one included, to engage in \"less than meticulous,\" <i>Kontrick, supra,</i> at 454, 124 S.Ct. 906, sometimes even \"profligate ... use of the term,\" <i>Arbaugh, supra,</i> at 510, 126 S.Ct. 1235.</p>\n<p>In recent years, however, we have tried to clean up our language, and until today we have been avoiding the erroneous jurisdictional conclusions that flow from indiscriminate use of the ambiguous word. Thus, although we used to call the sort of time limit at issue here \"mandatory and jurisdictional,\" <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960), we have recently and repeatedly corrected that designation as a misuse of the \"jurisdiction\" label. <i>Arbaugh, supra,</i> at 510, 126 S.Ct. 1235 (citing <i>Robinson</i> as an example of improper use of the term \"jurisdiction\"); <i>Eberhart v. United States,</i> 546 U.S. 12, 17-18, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005) <i>(per curiam)</i> (same); <i>Kontrick, supra,</i> at 454, 124 S.Ct. 906 (same).</p>\n<p>But one would never guess this from reading the Court's opinion in this case, which suddenly restores <i>Robinson's</i> indiscriminate use of the \"mandatory and jurisdictional\" label to good law in the face of three unanimous repudiations of <i>Robinson's</i> error. See <i>ante,</i> at 2363-2364. This is puzzling, the more so because our recent (and, I repeat, unanimous) efforts to confine jurisdictional rulings to jurisdiction proper were obviously sound, and the majority makes no attempt to show they were not.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2368</span> The stakes are high in treating time limits as jurisdictional. While a mandatory but nonjurisdictional limit is enforceable at the insistence of a party claiming its benefit or by a judge concerned with moving the docket, it may be waived or mitigated in exercising reasonable equitable discretion. But if a limit is taken to be jurisdictional, waiver becomes impossible, meritorious excuse irrelevant (unless the statute so provides), and <i>sua sponte</i> consideration in the courts of appeals mandatory, see <i>Arbaugh, supra,</i> at 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235.<sup>[2]</sup> As the Court recognizes, <i>ante,</i> at 2364-2365, this is no way to regard time limits set out in a court rule rather than a statute, see <i>Kontrick, supra,</i> at 452, 124 S.Ct. 906 (\"Only Congress may determine a lower federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction\"). But neither is jurisdictional treatment automatic when a time limit is statutory, as it is in this case. Generally speaking, limits on the reach of federal statutes, even nontemporal ones, are only jurisdictional if Congress says so: \"when Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.\" <i>Arbaugh,</i> 546 U.S., at 516, 126 S.Ct. 1235. Thus, we have held \"that time prescriptions, however emphatic, `are not properly typed \"jurisdictional,\"'\" <i>id.,</i> at 510, 126 S.Ct. 1235 (quoting <i>Scarborough v. Principi,</i> 541 U.S. 401, 414, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004)), absent some jurisdictional designation by Congress. Congress put no jurisdictional tag on the time limit here.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2369</span> The doctrinal underpinning of this recently repeated view was set out in <i>Kontrick:</i> \"the label `jurisdictional' [is appropriate] not for claim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court's adjudicatory authority.\" 540 U.S., at 455, 124 S.Ct. 906. A filing deadline is the paradigm of a claim-processing rule, not of a delineation of cases that federal courts may hear, and so it falls outside the class of limitations on subject matter jurisdiction unless Congress says otherwise.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The time limit at issue here, far from defining the set of cases that may be adjudicated, is much more like a statute of limitations, which provides an affirmative defense, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c), and is not jurisdictional, <i>Day v. McDonough,</i> 547 U.S. 198, 205, 126 S.Ct. 1675, 164 L.Ed.2d 376 (2006). Statutes of limitations may thus be waived, <i>id.,</i> at 207-208, 126 S.Ct. 1675, or excused by rules, such as equitable tolling, that alleviate hardship and unfairness, see <i>Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</i> 498 U.S. 89, 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990).</p>\n<p>Consistent with the traditional view of statutes of limitations, and the carefully limited concept of jurisdiction explained in <i>Arbaugh, Eberhart,</i> and <i>Kontrick,</i> an exception to the time limit in 28 U.S.C. § 2107(c) should be available when there is a good justification for one, for reasons we recognized years ago. In <i>Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc.,</i> 371 U.S. 215, 217, 83 S.Ct. 283, 9 L.Ed.2d 261 (1962) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> and <i>Thompson v. INS,</i> 375 U.S. 384, 387, 84 S.Ct. 397, 11 L.Ed.2d 404 (1964) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> we found that \"unique circumstances\" excused failures to comply with the time limit. In fact, much like this case, <i>Harris</i> and <i>Thompson</i> involved district court errors that misled litigants into believing they had more time to file notices of appeal than a statute actually provided. Thus, even back when we thoughtlessly called time limits jurisdictional, we did not actually treat them as beyond exemption to the point of shrugging at the inequity of penalizing a party for relying on what a federal judge had said to him. Since we did not dishonor reasonable reliance on a judge's official word back in the days when we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2370</span> uncritically had a jurisdictional reason to be unfair, it is unsupportable to dishonor it now, after repeatedly disavowing any such jurisdictional justification that would apply to the 14-day time limit of § 2107(c).</p>\n<p>The majority avoids clashing with <i>Harris</i> and <i>Thompson</i> by overruling them on the ground of their \"slumber,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2366, and inconsistency with a time-limit-as-jurisdictional rule.<sup>[5]</sup> But eliminating those precedents underscores what has become the principal question of this case: why does today's majority refuse to come to terms with the steady stream of unanimous statements from this Court in the past four years, culminating in <i>Arbaugh</i>'s summary a year ago? The majority begs this question by refusing to confront what we have said: \"in recent decisions, we have clarified that time prescriptions, however emphatic, `are not properly typed \"jurisdictional.\"'\" <i>Arbaugh,</i> 546 U.S., at 510, 126 S.Ct. 1235 (quoting <i>Scarborough,</i> 541 U.S., at 414, 124 S.Ct. 1856). This statement of the Court, and those preceding it for which it stands as a summation, cannot be dismissed as \"some dicta,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2363-2364, n. 2, and cannot be ignored on the ground that some of them were made in cases where the challenged restriction was not a time limit, see <i>ante,</i> at 2364-2365. By its refusal to come to grips with our considered statements of law the majority leaves the Court incoherent.</p>\n<p>In ruling that Bowles cannot depend on the word of a District Court Judge, the Court demonstrates that no one may depend on the recent, repeated, and unanimous statements of all participating Justices of this Court. Yet more incongruously, all of these pronouncements by the Court, along with two of our cases,<sup>[6]</sup> are jettisoned in a ruling for which the leading justification is <i>stare decisis,</i> see <i>ante,</i> at 2363-2364 (\"This Court has long held ...\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We have the authority to recognize an equitable exception to the 14-day limit, and we should do that here, as it certainly seems reasonable to rely on an order from a federal judge.<sup>[7]</sup> Bowles, though, does not have to convince us as a matter of first impression that his reliance was justified, for we only have to look as far as <i>Thompson</i> to know that he ought to prevail. There, the would-be appellant, Thompson, had filed post-trial motions 12 days after the District Court's final order. Although the rules said they should have been filed within 10, Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 52(b) and 59(b) (1964), the trial court nonetheless had \"specifically declared that the `motion for a new trial' was made `in ample time.'\" <i>Thompson,</i> 375 U.S., at 385, 84 S.Ct. 397. Thompson relied on that statement in filing a notice of appeal within 60 days of the denial of the post-trial motions but not within 60 days of entry of the original judgment. Only timely post-trial motions affected the 60-day time limit for filing a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2371</span> notice of appeal, Rule 73(a) (1964), so the Court of Appeals held the appeal untimely. We vacated because Thompson \"relied on the statement of the District Court and filed the appeal within the assumedly new deadline but beyond the old deadline.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 387, 84 S.Ct. 397.</p>\n<p><i>Thompson</i> should control. In that case, and this one, the untimely filing of a notice of appeal resulted from reliance on an error by a district court, an error that caused no evident prejudice to the other party. Actually, there is one difference between <i>Thompson</i> and this case: Thompson filed his post-trial motions late and the District Court was mistaken when it said they were timely; here, the District Court made the error out of the blue, not on top of any mistake by Bowles, who then filed his notice of appeal by the specific date the District Court had declared timely. If anything, this distinction ought to work in Bowles's favor. Why should we have rewarded Thompson, who introduced the error, but now punish Bowles, who merely trusted the District Court's statement?<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Under <i>Thompson,</i> it would be no answer to say that Bowles's trust was unreasonable because the 14-day limit was clear and counsel should have checked the judge's arithmetic. The 10-day limit on post-trial motions was no less pellucid in <i>Thompson,</i> which came out the other way. And what is more, counsel here could not have uncovered the court's error simply by counting off the days on a calendar. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6) allows a party to file a notice of appeal within 14 days of \"the date when [the district court's] order to reopen is entered.\" See also 28 U.S.C. § 2107(c)(2) (allowing reopening for \"14 days from the date of entry\"). The District Court's order was dated February 10, 2004, which reveals the date the judge signed it but not necessarily the date on which the order was entered. Bowles's lawyer therefore could not tell from reading the order, which he received by mail, whether it was entered the day it was signed. Nor is the possibility of delayed entry merely theoretical: the District Court's original judgment in this case, dated July 10, 2003, was not entered until July 28. See App. 11 (District Court docket). According to Bowles's lawyer, electronic access to the docket was unavailable at the time, so to learn when the order was actually entered he would have had to call or go to the courthouse and check. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 56-57. Surely this is more than equity demands, and unless every statement by a federal court is to be tagged with the warning \"Beware of the Judge,\" Bowles's lawyer had no obligation to go behind the terms of the order he received.</p>\n<p>I have to admit that Bowles's counsel probably did not think the order might have been entered on a different day from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2372</span> the day it was signed. He probably just trusted that the date given was correct, and there was nothing unreasonable in so trusting. The other side let the order pass without objection, either not caring enough to make a fuss or not even noticing the discrepancy; the mistake of a few days was probably not enough to ring the alarm bell to send either lawyer to his copy of the federal rules and then off to the courthouse to check the docket.<sup>[9]</sup> This would be a different case if the year were wrong on the District Court's order, or if opposing counsel had flagged the error. But on the actual facts, it was reasonable to rely on a facially plausible date provided by a federal judge.</p>\n<p>I would vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for consideration of the merits.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Rule was amended, effective December 1, 2005, to require that notice be pursuant to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 77(d). The substance is otherwise unchanged.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Griggs</i> and several other of this Court's decisions ultimately rely on <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960), for the proposition that the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional. As the dissent notes, we have recently questioned <i>Robinson's</i> use of the term \"jurisdictional.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2367 (opinion of SOUTER, J.) Even in our cases criticizing <i>Robinson,</i> however, we have noted the jurisdictional significance of the fact that a time limit is set forth in a statute, see <i>infra,</i> at 2364-2365, and have even pointed to § 2107 as a statute deserving of jurisdictional treatment. <i>Infra,</i> at 2364-2365. Additionally, because we rely on those cases in reaching today's holding, the dissent's rhetoric claiming that we are ignoring their reasoning is unfounded.\n</p>\n<p>Regardless of this Court's past careless use of terminology, it is indisputable that time limits for filing a notice of appeal have been treated as jurisdictional in American law for well over a century. Consequently, the dissent's approach would require the repudiation of a century's worth of precedent and practice in American courts. Given the choice between calling into question some dicta in our recent opinions and effectively overruling a century's worth of practice, we think the former option is the only prudent course.</p>\n<p>[3]  At least one federal court of appeals has noted that <i>Kontrick</i> and <i>Eberhart</i> \"called ... into question\" the \"longstanding assumption\" that the timely filing of a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement. <i>United States v. Sadler,</i> 480 F.3d 932, 935 (C.A.9 2007). That court nonetheless found that \"[t]he distinction between jurisdictional rules and inflexible but not jurisdictional timeliness rules drawn by <i>Eberhart</i> and <i>Kontrick</i> turns largely on whether the timeliness requirement is or is not grounded in a statute.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 936.</p>\n<p>[4]  The dissent minimizes this argument, stating that the Court understood § 2101(c) as jurisdictional \"in the days when we used the term imprecisely.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2369, n. 4. The dissent's apathy is surprising because if our treatment of our own jurisdiction is simply a relic of the old days, it is a relic with severe consequences. Just a few months ago, the Clerk, pursuant to this Court's Rule 13.2, refused to accept a petition for certiorari submitted by Ryan Heath Dickson because it had been filed one day late. In the letter sent to Dickson's counsel, the Clerk explained that \"[w]hen the time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in a civil case ... has expired, the Court no longer has the power to review the petition.\" Letter from William K. Suter, Clerk of Court, to Ronald T. Spriggs (Dec. 28, 2006). Dickson was executed on April 26, 2007, without any Member of this Court having even seen his petition for certiorari. The rejected certiorari petition was Dickson's first in this Court, and one can only speculate as to whether denial of that petition would have been a foregone conclusion.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Court thinks my fellow dissenters and I are forgetful of an opinion I wrote and the others joined in 2003, which referred to the 30-day rule of 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a) as a jurisdictional time limit. See <i>ante,</i> at 2364 (quoting <i>Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co.,</i> 537 U.S. 149, 160, n. 6, 123 S.Ct. 748, 154 L.Ed.2d 653 (2003)). But that reference in <i>Barnhart</i> was a perfect example of the confusion of the mandatory and the jurisdictional that the entire Court has spent the past four years repudiating in <i>Arbaugh, Eberhart,</i> and <i>Kontrick.</i> My fellow dissenters and I believe that the Court was right to correct its course; the majority, however, will not even admit that we deliberately changed course, let alone explain why it is now changing course again.</p>\n<p>[2]  The requirement that courts of appeals raise jurisdictional issues <i>sua sponte</i> reveals further ill effects of today's decision. Under § 2107(c), \"[t]he district court may ... extend the time for appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause.\" By the Court's logic, if a district court grants such an extension, the extension's propriety is subject to mandatory <i>sua sponte</i> review in the court of appeals, even if the extension was unopposed throughout, and upon finding error the court of appeals must dismiss the appeal. I see no more justification for such a rule than reason to suspect Congress meant to create it.</p>\n<p>[3]  The majority answers that a footnote of our unanimous opinion in <i>Kontrick v. Ryan,</i> 540 U.S. 443, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004), used § 2107(a) as an illustration of a jurisdictional time limit. <i>Ante,</i> at 2364-2365 (\"[W]e noted that § 2107 contains the type of statutory time constraints that would limit a court's jurisdiction. 540 U.S., at 453, and n. 8, 124 S.Ct. 906\"). What the majority overlooks, however, are the post-<i>Kontrick</i> cases showing that § 2107(a) can no longer be seen as an example of a jurisdictional time limit. The jurisdictional character of the 30-(or 60)-day time limit for filing notices of appeal under the present § 2107(a) was first pronounced by this Court in <i>Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill.,</i> 434 U.S. 257, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). But in that respect <i>Browder</i> was undercut by <i>Eberhart v. United States,</i> 546 U.S. 12, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> decided after <i>Kontrick. Eberhart</i> cited <i>Browder</i> (along with several of the other cases on which the Court now relies) as an example of the basic error of confusing mandatory time limits with jurisdictional limitations, a confusion for which <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 361 U.S. 220, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960), was responsible. Compare <i>ante,</i> at 2363-2364 (citing <i>Browder, Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co.,</i> 459 U.S. 56, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> and <i>Hohn v. United States,</i> 524 U.S. 236, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998)), with <i>Eberhart, supra,</i> at 17-18, 126 S.Ct. 403 (citing those cases as examples of the confusion caused by <i>Robinson's</i> imprecise language). <i>Eberhart</i> was followed four months later by <i>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp.,</i> 546 U.S. 500, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006), which summarized the body of recent decisions in which the Court \"clarified that time prescriptions, however emphatic, are not properly typed jurisdictional,\" <i>id.,</i> at 510, 126 S.Ct. 1235 (internal quotation marks omitted). This unanimous statement of all Members of the Court participating in the case eliminated the option of continuing to accept § 2107(a) as jurisdictional and it precludes treating the 14-day period of § 2107(c) as a limit on jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Court points out that we have affixed a \"jurisdiction\" label to the time limit contained in § 2101(c) for petitions for writ of certiorari in civil cases. <i>Ante,</i> at 2364-2366 (citing <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. NRA Political Victory Fund,</i> 513 U.S. 88, 90, 115 S.Ct. 537, 130 L.Ed.2d 439 (1994); this Court's Rule 13.2). Of course, we initially did so in the days when we used the term imprecisely. The status of § 2101(c) is not before the Court in this case, so I express no opinion on whether there are sufficient reasons to treat it as jurisdictional. The Court's observation that jurisdictional treatment has had severe consequences in that context, <i>ante,</i> at 2365, n. 4, does nothing to support an argument that jurisdictional treatment is sound, but instead merely shows that the certiorari rule, too, should be reconsidered in light of our recent clarifications of what sorts of rules should be treated as jurisdictional.</p>\n<p>[5]  With no apparent sense of irony, the Court finds that \"`[o]ur later cases ... effectively repudiate the <i>Harris Truck Lines</i> approach.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2366 (quoting <i>Houston v. Lack,</i> 487 U.S. 266, 282, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); omission in original). Of course, those \"later cases\" were <i>Browder</i> and <i>Griggs,</i> see <i>Houston, supra,</i> at 282, 108 S.Ct. 2379, which have themselves been repudiated, not just \"effectively\" but explicitly, in <i>Eberhart.</i> See n. 3, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>[6]  Three, if we include <i>Wolfsohn v. Hankin,</i> 376 U.S. 203, 84 S.Ct. 699, 11 L.Ed.2d 636 (1964) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>[7]  As a member of the Federal Judiciary, I cannot help but think that reliance on our orders is reasonable. See O. Holmes, Natural Law, in Collected Legal Papers 311 (1920). I would also rest better knowing that my innocent errors will not jeopardize anyone's rights unless absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>[8]  Nothing in <i>Osterneck v. Ernst &amp; Whinney,</i> 489 U.S. 169, 109 S.Ct. 987, 103 L.Ed.2d 146 (1989), requires such a strange rule. In <i>Osterneck,</i> we described the \"unique circumstances\" doctrine as applicable \"only where a party has performed an act which, if properly done, would postpone the deadline for filing his appeal and has received specific assurance by a judicial officer that this act has been properly done.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 179, 109 S.Ct. 987. But the point we were making was that <i>Thompson</i> could not excuse a lawyer's original mistake in a case in which a judge had not assured him that his act had been timely; the Court of Appeals in <i>Osterneck</i> had found that no court provided a specific assurance, and we agreed. I see no reason to take <i>Osterneck's</i> language out of context to buttress a fundamentally unfair resolution of an issue the <i>Osterneck</i> Court did not have in front of it. Cf. <i>St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks,</i> 509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (\"[W]e think it generally undesirable, where holdings of the Court are not at issue, to dissect the sentences of the United States Reports as though they were the United States Code\").</p>\n<p>[9]  At first glance it may seem unreasonable for counsel to wait until the penultimate day under the judge's order, filing a notice of appeal being so easy that counsel should not have needed the extra time. But as Bowles's lawyer pointed out at oral argument, filing the notice of appeal starts the clock for filing the record, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 6(b)(2)(B), which in turn starts the clock for filing a brief, see Rule 31(a)(1), for which counsel might reasonably want as much time as possible. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6. A good lawyer plans ahead, and Bowles had a good lawyer.</p>\n\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b>127 S.Ct. 2360 (2007)</b></center>\n<center><h1>Keith BOWLES, Petitioner,<br>\nv.<br>\nHarry RUSSELL, Warden.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 06-5306.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued March 26, 2007.</center>\n<center>Decided June 14, 2007.</center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2362</span> Paul Mancino, Jr., Cleveland, Ohio, for Petitioner.</p>\n<p>William P.

We must decide whether the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal filed after the statutory period but within the period allowed by the District Court's order. We have long and repeatedly held that the time limits for filing a notice of appeal are jurisdictional in nature. Accordingly, we hold that petitioner's untimely noticeeven though filed in reliance upon a District Court's order deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1999, an Ohio jury convicted petitioner Keith Bowles of murder for his involvement in the beating death of Ollie Gipson. The jury sentenced Bowles to 15 years to life imprisonment. Bowles unsuccessfully challenged his conviction and sentence on direct appeal.</p>\n<p>Bowles then filed a federal habeas corpus application on September 5, 2002. On September 9, 2003, the District Court denied Bowles habeas relief. After the entry of final judgment, Bowles had 30 days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A); 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a). He failed to do so. On December 12, 2003, Bowles moved to reopen the period during which he could file his notice of appeal pursuant to Rule 4(a)(6), which allows district courts to extend the filing period for 14 days from the day the district court grants the order to reopen, provided certain conditions are met. See § 2107(c).</p>\n<p>On February 10, 2004, the District Court granted Bowles' motion. But rather than extending the time period by 14 days, as Rule 4(a)(6) and § 2107(c) allow, the District Court inexplicably gave Bowles 17 daysuntil February 27to file his notice of appeal. Bowles filed his notice on February 26within the 17 days allowed by the District Court's order, but after the 14-day period allowed by Rule 4(a)(6) and § 2107(c).</p>\n<p>On appeal, respondent Russell argued that Bowles' notice was untimely and that the Court of Appeals therefore lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The Court of Appeals agreed. It first recognized that this Court has consistently held the requirement of filing a timely notice of appeal is \"mandatory and jurisdictional.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792728\"><a href=\"/opinion/792728/keith-bowles-v-harry-russell-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 673 (C.A.6 2005) (citing <i>Browder v.

The court also noted that courts of appeals have uniformly held that Rule 4(a)(6)'s 180-day period for filing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2363</span> a motion to reopen is also mandatory and not susceptible to equitable modification. 432 F.3d, at 673 (collecting cases). Concluding that \"the fourteen-day period in Rule 4(a)(6) should be treated as strictly as the 180-day period in that same Rule,\" <i>id.,</i> at 676, the Court of Appeals held that it was without jurisdiction. We granted certiorari, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 763, 166 L.Ed.2d 590 (2006), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>According to 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a), parties must file notices of appeal within 30 days of the entry of the judgment being appealed. District courts have limited authority to grant an extension of the 30-day time period. Relevant to this case, if certain conditions are met, district courts have the statutory authority to grant motions to reopen the time for filing an appeal for 14 additional days. § 2107(c). Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure carries § 2107 into practice. In accord with § 2107(c), Rule 4(a)(6) describes the district court's authority to reopen and extend the time for filing a notice of appeal after the lapse of the usual 30 days:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The district court may reopen the time to file an appeal <i>for a period of 14 days after the date when its order to reopen is entered,</i> but only if all the following conditions are satisfied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice of the entry, whichever is earlier;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) the court finds that the moving party was entitled to notice of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed but did not receive the notice from the district court or any party within 21 days after entry; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.\" (Emphasis added.)<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>It is undisputed that the District Court's order in this case purported to reopen the filing period for more than 14 days. Thus, the question before us is whether the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to entertain an appeal filed outside the 14-day window allowed by § 2107(c) but within the longer period granted by the District Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>This Court has long held that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is \"mandatory and jurisdictional.\" <i>Griggs v.

In fact, the author of today's dissent recently reiterated that \"[t]he accepted fact is that some time limits are jurisdictional even though expressed in a separate statutory section from jurisdictional grants, see, <i>e.g.,</i> ... § 2107 (providing that notice of appeal in civil cases must be filed `within thirty days after the entry of such judgment').\" <i>Barnhart v.

Critical to our analysis was the fact that \"[n]o statute ... specifies a time limit for filing a complaint objecting to the debtor's discharge.\" 540 U.S., at 448, 124 S.Ct. 906. Rather, the filing deadlines in the Bankruptcy Rules are \"`procedural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business'\" that are \"`not jurisdictional.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 454, 124 S.Ct. 906 (quoting <i>Schacht v.

In <i>Arbaugh,</i> the statutory limitation was an employee-numerosity requirement, not a time limit. 546 U.S., at 505, 126 S.Ct. 1235. <i>Scarborough,</i> which addressed the availability of attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, concerned \"a mode of relief... ancillary to the judgment of a court\" that already had plenary jurisdiction. 541 U.S., at 413, 124 S.Ct. 1856.</p>\n<p>This Court's treatment of its certiorari jurisdiction also demonstrates the jurisdictional distinction between court-promulgated rules and limits enacted by Congress. According to our Rules, a petition for a writ of certiorari must be filed within 90 days of the entry of the judgment sought to be reviewed. See this Court's Rule 13.1. That 90-day period applies to both civil and criminal cases. But the 90-day period for civil cases derives from both this Court's Rule 13.1 and 28 U.S.C. § 2101(c). We have repeatedly held that this statute-based filing period for civil cases is jurisdictional. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Federal Election Comm'n v. NRA Political Victory Fund,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117882\"><a href=\"/opinion/117882/federal-election-commn-v-nra-political-victory-fun/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span>, 90, 115 S.Ct. 537, 130 L.Ed.2d 439 (1994). Indeed, this Court's Rule 13.2 cites § 2101(c) in directing the Clerk not to file any petition \"that is <i>jurisdictionally</i> out of time.\" (Emphasis added.) On the other hand, we have treated the rule-based time limit for criminal cases differently, stating that it may be waived because \"[t]he procedural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business are not jurisdictional and can be relaxed by the Court in the exercise of its discretion ....\" <i>Schacht, supra,</i> at 64, 90 S.Ct. 1555.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Jurisdictional treatment of statutory time limits makes good sense. Within constitutional bounds, Congress decides what cases the federal courts have jurisdiction to consider. Because Congress decides whether federal courts can hear cases at all, it can also determine when, and under what conditions, federal courts can hear them. See <i>Curry,</i> 6 How., at 113, 12 L.Ed. 363. Put another way, the notion of \"`subject-matter'\" jurisdiction obviously extends to \"`classes of cases ... falling within a court's adjudicatory authority,'\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2366</span> <i>Eberhart, supra,</i> at 16, 126 S.Ct. 403 (quoting <i>Kontrick, supra,</i> at 455, 124 S.Ct. 906), but it is no less \"jurisdictional\" when Congress forbids federal courts from adjudicating an otherwise legitimate \"class of cases\" after a certain period has elapsed from final judgment.</p>\n<p>The resolution of this case follows naturally from this reasoning. Like the initial 30-day period for filing a notice of appeal, the limit on how long a district court may reopen that period is set forth in a statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2107(c). Because Congress specifically limited the amount of time by which district courts can extend the notice-of-appeal period in § 2107(c), that limitation is more than a simple \"claim-processing rule.\" As we have long held, when an \"appeal has not been prosecuted in the manner directed, within the time limited by the acts of Congress, it must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\" <i>Curry, supra,</i> at 113. Bowles' failure to file his notice of appeal in accordance with the statute therefore deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction. And because Bowles' error is one of jurisdictional magnitude, he cannot rely on forfeiture or waiver to excuse his lack of compliance with the statute's time limitations. See <i>Arbaugh, supra,</i> at 513-514, 126 S.Ct. 1235.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Bowles contends that we should excuse his untimely filing because he satisfies the \"unique circumstances\" doctrine, which has its roots in <i>Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v.

The District Court found the moving party had established a showing of \"excusable neglect,\" as required by the Rule, and granted the motion. The Court of Appeals reversed the finding of excusable neglect and, accordingly, held that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to grant the extension. <i>Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v.

This Court reversed, noting \"the obvious great hardship to a party who relies upon the trial judge's finding of `excusable neglect.'\" 371 U.S., at 217, 83 S.Ct. 283.</p>\n<p>Today we make clear that the timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement. Because this Court has no authority to create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements, use of the \"unique circumstances\" doctrine is illegitimate.

We see no compelling reason to resurrect the doctrine from its 40-year slumber.

Even narrow rules to this effect would give rise to litigation testing their reach and would no doubt detract from the clarity of the rule. However, congressionally authorized rulemaking would likely lead to less litigation than court-created exceptions without authorization. And in all events, for the reasons discussed above, we lack present authority to make the exception petitioner seeks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Bowles' appeal.

See <i>ante,</i> at 2363-2364. This is puzzling, the more so because our recent (and, I repeat, unanimous) efforts to confine jurisdictional rulings to jurisdiction proper were obviously sound, and the majority makes no attempt to show they were not.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2368</span> The stakes are high in treating time limits as jurisdictional. While a mandatory but nonjurisdictional limit is enforceable at the insistence of a party claiming its benefit or by a judge concerned with moving the docket, it may be waived or mitigated in exercising reasonable equitable discretion. But if a limit is taken to be jurisdictional, waiver becomes impossible, meritorious excuse irrelevant (unless the statute so provides), and <i>sua sponte</i> consideration in the courts of appeals mandatory, see <i>Arbaugh, supra,</i> at 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235.<sup>[2]</sup> As the Court recognizes, <i>ante,</i> at 2364-2365, this is no way to regard time limits set out in a court rule rather than a statute, see <i>Kontrick, supra,</i> at 452, 124 S.Ct. 906 (\"Only Congress may determine a lower federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction\"). But neither is jurisdictional treatment automatic when a time limit is statutory, as it is in this case. Generally speaking, limits on the reach of federal statutes, even nontemporal ones, are only jurisdictional if Congress says so: \"when Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.\" <i>Arbaugh,</i> 546 U.S., at 516, 126 S.Ct. 1235. Thus, we have held \"that time prescriptions, however emphatic, `are not properly typed \"jurisdictional,\"'\" <i>id.,</i> at 510, 126 S.Ct. 1235 (quoting <i>Scarborough v. Principi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134738\"><a href=\"/opinion/134738/scarborough-v-principi/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 414, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004)), absent some jurisdictional designation by Congress. Congress put no jurisdictional tag on the time limit here.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2369</span> The doctrinal underpinning of this recently repeated view was set out in <i>Kontrick:</i> \"the label `jurisdictional' [is appropriate] not for claim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court's adjudicatory authority.\" 540 U.S., at 455, 124 S.Ct. 906. A filing deadline is the paradigm of a claim-processing rule, not of a delineation of cases that federal courts may hear, and so it falls outside the class of limitations on subject matter jurisdiction unless Congress says otherwise.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The time limit at issue here, far from defining the set of cases that may be adjudicated, is much more like a statute of limitations, which provides an affirmative defense, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c), and is not jurisdictional, <i>Day v. McDonough,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145664\"><a href=\"/opinion/145664/day-v-mcdonough/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span>, 205, 126 S.Ct. 1675, 164 L.Ed.2d 376 (2006). Statutes of limitations may thus be waived, <i>id.,</i> at 207-208, 126 S.Ct. 1675, or excused by rules, such as equitable tolling, that alleviate hardship and unfairness, see <i>Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span>, 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990).</p>\n<p>Consistent with the traditional view of statutes of limitations, and the carefully limited concept of jurisdiction explained in <i>Arbaugh, Eberhart,</i> and <i>Kontrick,</i> an exception to the time limit in 28 U.S.C. § 2107(c) should be available when there is a good justification for one, for reasons we recognized years ago.

In fact, much like this case, <i>Harris</i> and <i>Thompson</i> involved district court errors that misled litigants into believing they had more time to file notices of appeal than a statute actually provided. Thus, even back when we thoughtlessly called time limits jurisdictional, we did not actually treat them as beyond exemption to the point of shrugging at the inequity of penalizing a party for relying on what a federal judge had said to him. Since we did not dishonor reasonable reliance on a judge's official word back in the days when we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2370</span> uncritically had a jurisdictional reason to be unfair, it is unsupportable to dishonor it now, after repeatedly disavowing any such jurisdictional justification that would apply to the 14-day time limit of § 2107(c).</p>\n<p>The majority avoids clashing with <i>Harris</i> and <i>Thompson</i> by overruling them on the ground of their \"slumber,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2366, and inconsistency with a time-limit-as-jurisdictional rule.<sup>[5]</sup> But eliminating those precedents underscores what has become the principal question of this case: why does today's majority refuse to come to terms with the steady stream of unanimous statements from this Court in the past four years, culminating in <i>Arbaugh</i>'s summary a year ago? The majority begs this question by refusing to confront what we have said: \"in recent decisions, we have clarified that time prescriptions, however emphatic, `are not properly typed \"jurisdictional.\"'\" <i>Arbaugh,</i> 546 U.S., at 510, 126 S.Ct. 1235 (quoting <i>Scarborough,</i> 541 U.S., at 414, 124 S.Ct. 1856). This statement of the Court, and those preceding it for which it stands as a summation, cannot be dismissed as \"some dicta,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2363-2364, n. 2, and cannot be ignored on the ground that some of them were made in cases where the challenged restriction was not a time limit, see <i>ante,</i> at 2364-2365. By its refusal to come to grips with our considered statements of law the majority leaves the Court incoherent.</p>\n<p>In ruling that Bowles cannot depend on the word of a District Court Judge, the Court demonstrates that no one may depend on the recent, repeated, and unanimous statements of all participating Justices of this Court. Yet more incongruously, all of these pronouncements by the Court, along with two of our cases,<sup>[6]</sup> are jettisoned in a ruling for which the leading justification is <i>stare decisis,</i> see <i>ante,</i> at 2363-2364 (\"This Court has long held ...\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We have the authority to recognize an equitable exception to the 14-day limit, and we should do that here, as it certainly seems reasonable to rely on an order from a federal judge.<sup>[7]</sup> Bowles, though, does not have to convince us as a matter of first impression that his reliance was justified, for we only have to look as far as <i>Thompson</i> to know that he ought to prevail. There, the would-be appellant, Thompson, had filed post-trial motions 12 days after the District Court's final order. Although the rules said they should have been filed within 10, Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 52(b) and 59(b) (1964), the trial court nonetheless had \"specifically declared that the `motion for a new trial' was made `in ample time.'\" <i>Thompson,</i> 375 U.S., at 385, 84 S.Ct. 397. Thompson relied on that statement in filing a notice of appeal within 60 days of the denial of the post-trial motions but not within 60 days of entry of the original judgment. Only timely post-trial motions affected the 60-day time limit for filing a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2371</span> notice of appeal, Rule 73(a) (1964), so the Court of Appeals held the appeal untimely. We vacated because Thompson \"relied on the statement of the District Court and filed the appeal within the assumedly new deadline but beyond the old deadline.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 387, 84 S.Ct. 397.</p>\n<p><i>Thompson</i> should control. In that case, and this one, the untimely filing of a notice of appeal resulted from reliance on an error by a district court, an error that caused no evident prejudice to the other party. Actually, there is one difference between <i>Thompson</i> and this case: Thompson filed his post-trial motions late and the District Court was mistaken when it said they were timely; here, the District Court made the error out of the blue, not on top of any mistake by Bowles, who then filed his notice of appeal by the specific date the District Court had declared timely. If anything, this distinction ought to work in Bowles's favor. Why should we have rewarded Thompson, who introduced the error, but now punish Bowles, who merely trusted the District Court's statement?<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Under <i>Thompson,</i> it would be no answer to say that Bowles's trust was unreasonable because the 14-day limit was clear and counsel should have checked the judge's arithmetic. The 10-day limit on post-trial motions was no less pellucid in <i>Thompson,</i> which came out the other way. And what is more, counsel here could not have uncovered the court's error simply by counting off the days on a calendar. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6) allows a party to file a notice of appeal within 14 days of \"the date when [the district court's] order to reopen is entered.\" See also 28 U.S.C. § 2107(c)(2) (allowing reopening for \"14 days from the date of entry\"). The District Court's order was dated February 10, 2004, which reveals the date the judge signed it but not necessarily the date on which the order was entered. Bowles's lawyer therefore could not tell from reading the order, which he received by mail, whether it was entered the day it was signed. Nor is the possibility of delayed entry merely theoretical: the District Court's original judgment in this case, dated July 10, 2003, was not entered until July 28. See App. 11 (District Court docket). According to Bowles's lawyer, electronic access to the docket was unavailable at the time, so to learn when the order was actually entered he would have had to call or go to the courthouse and check. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 56-57. Surely this is more than equity demands, and unless every statement by a federal court is to be tagged with the warning \"Beware of the Judge,\" Bowles's lawyer had no obligation to go behind the terms of the order he received.</p>\n<p>I have to admit that Bowles's counsel probably did not think the order might have been entered on a different day from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2372</span> the day it was signed. He probably just trusted that the date given was correct, and there was nothing unreasonable in so trusting. The other side let the order pass without objection, either not caring enough to make a fuss or not even noticing the discrepancy; the mistake of a few days was probably not enough to ring the alarm bell to send either lawyer to his copy of the federal rules and then off to the courthouse to check the docket.<sup>[9]</sup> This would be a different case if the year were wrong on the District Court's order, or if opposing counsel had flagged the error. But on the actual facts, it was reasonable to rely on a facially plausible date provided by a federal judge.</p>\n<p>I would vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for consideration of the merits.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Rule was amended, effective December 1, 2005, to require that notice be pursuant to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 77(d). The substance is otherwise unchanged.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Griggs</i> and several other of this Court's decisions ultimately rely on <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105979\"><a href=\"/opinion/105979/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960), for the proposition that the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional. As the dissent notes, we have recently questioned <i>Robinson's</i> use of the term \"jurisdictional.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2367 (opinion of SOUTER, J.) Even in our cases criticizing <i>Robinson,</i> however, we have noted the jurisdictional significance of the fact that a time limit is set forth in a statute, see <i>infra,</i> at 2364-2365, and have even pointed to § 2107 as a statute deserving of jurisdictional treatment. <i>Infra,</i> at 2364-2365. Additionally, because we rely on those cases in reaching today's holding, the dissent's rhetoric claiming that we are ignoring their reasoning is unfounded.\n</p>\n<p>Regardless of this Court's past careless use of terminology, it is indisputable that time limits for filing a notice of appeal have been treated as jurisdictional in American law for well over a century. Consequently, the dissent's approach would require the repudiation of a century's worth of precedent and practice in American courts. Given the choice between calling into question some dicta in our recent opinions and effectively overruling a century's worth of practice, we think the former option is the only prudent course.</p>\n<p>[3]  At least one federal court of appeals has noted that <i>Kontrick</i> and <i>Eberhart</i> \"called ... into question\" the \"longstanding assumption\" that the timely filing of a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement. <i>United States v. Sadler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797202\"><a href=\"/opinion/797202/united-states-v-philip-martin-sadler/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span>, 935 (C.A.9 2007). That court nonetheless found that \"[t]he distinction between jurisdictional rules and inflexible but not jurisdictional timeliness rules drawn by <i>Eberhart</i> and <i>Kontrick</i> turns largely on whether the timeliness requirement is or is not grounded in a statute.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 936.</p>\n<p>[4]  The dissent minimizes this argument, stating that the Court understood § 2101(c) as jurisdictional \"in the days when we used the term imprecisely.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2369, n. 4. The dissent's apathy is surprising because if our treatment of our own jurisdiction is simply a relic of the old days, it is a relic with severe consequences. Just a few months ago, the Clerk, pursuant to this Court's Rule 13.2, refused to accept a petition for certiorari submitted by Ryan Heath Dickson because it had been filed one day late. In the letter sent to Dickson's counsel, the Clerk explained that \"[w]hen the time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in a civil case ... has expired, the Court no longer has the power to review the petition.\" Letter from William K. Suter, Clerk of Court, to Ronald T. Spriggs (Dec. 28, 2006). Dickson was executed on April 26, 2007, without any Member of this Court having even seen his petition for certiorari. The rejected certiorari petition was Dickson's first in this Court, and one can only speculate as to whether denial of that petition would have been a foregone conclusion.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Court thinks my fellow dissenters and I are forgetful of an opinion I wrote and the others joined in 2003, which referred to the 30-day rule of 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a) as a jurisdictional time limit. See <i>ante,</i> at 2364 (quoting <i>Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122253\"><a href=\"/opinion/122253/barnhart-v-peabody-coal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 160, n. 6, 123 S.Ct. 748, 154 L.Ed.2d 653 (2003)). But that reference in <i>Barnhart</i> was a perfect example of the confusion of the mandatory and the jurisdictional that the entire Court has spent the past four years repudiating in <i>Arbaugh, Eberhart,</i> and <i>Kontrick.</i> My fellow dissenters and I believe that the Court was right to correct its course; the majority, however, will not even admit that we deliberately changed course, let alone explain why it is now changing course again.</p>\n<p>[2]  The requirement that courts of appeals raise jurisdictional issues <i>sua sponte</i> reveals further ill effects of today's decision. Under § 2107(c), \"[t]he district court may ... extend the time for appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause.\" By the Court's logic, if a district court grants such an extension, the extension's propriety is subject to mandatory <i>sua sponte</i> review in the court of appeals, even if the extension was unopposed throughout, and upon finding error the court of appeals must dismiss the appeal. I see no more justification for such a rule than reason to suspect Congress meant to create it.</p>\n<p>[3]  The majority answers that a footnote of our unanimous opinion in <i>Kontrick v. Ryan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131156\"><a href=\"/opinion/131156/kontrick-v-ryan/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004), used § 2107(a) as an illustration of a jurisdictional time limit. <i>Ante,</i> at 2364-2365 (\"[W]e noted that § 2107 contains the type of statutory time constraints that would limit a court's jurisdiction. 540 U.S., at 453, and n. 8, 124 S.Ct. 906\"). What the majority overlooks, however, are the post-<i>Kontrick</i> cases showing that § 2107(a) can no longer be seen as an example of a jurisdictional time limit. The jurisdictional character of the 30-(or 60)-day time limit for filing notices of appeal under the present § 2107(a) was first pronounced by this Court in <i>Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109761\"><a href=\"/opinion/109761/browder-v-director-dept-of-corrections-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). But in that respect <i>Browder</i> was undercut by <i>Eberhart v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145119\"><a href=\"/opinion/145119/eberhart-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> decided after <i>Kontrick. Eberhart</i> cited <i>Browder</i> (along with several of the other cases on which the Court now relies) as an example of the basic error of confusing mandatory time limits with jurisdictional limitations, a confusion for which <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105979\"><a href=\"/opinion/105979/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960), was responsible.

This unanimous statement of all Members of the Court participating in the case eliminated the option of continuing to accept § 2107(a) as jurisdictional and it precludes treating the 14-day period of § 2107(c) as a limit on jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Court points out that we have affixed a \"jurisdiction\" label to the time limit contained in § 2101(c) for petitions for writ of certiorari in civil cases. <i>Ante,</i> at 2364-2366 (citing <i>Federal Election Comm'n v.

Of course, we initially did so in the days when we used the term imprecisely. The status of § 2101(c) is not before the Court in this case, so I express no opinion on whether there are sufficient reasons to treat it as jurisdictional. The Court's observation that jurisdictional treatment has had severe consequences in that context, <i>ante,</i> at 2365, n. 4, does nothing to support an argument that jurisdictional treatment is sound, but instead merely shows that the certiorari rule, too, should be reconsidered in light of our recent clarifications of what sorts of rules should be treated as jurisdictional.</p>\n<p>[5]  With no apparent sense of irony, the Court finds that \"`[o]ur later cases ... effectively repudiate the <i>Harris Truck Lines</i> approach.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2366 (quoting <i>Houston v.

Of course, those \"later cases\" were <i>Browder</i> and <i>Griggs,</i> see <i>Houston, supra,</i> at 282, 108 S.Ct. 2379, which have themselves been repudiated, not just \"effectively\" but explicitly, in <i>Eberhart.</i> See n. 3, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>[6]  Three, if we include <i>Wolfsohn v.

In <i>Osterneck,</i> we described the \"unique circumstances\" doctrine as applicable \"only where a party has performed an act which, if properly done, would postpone the deadline for filing his appeal and has received specific assurance by a judicial officer that this act has been properly done.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 179, 109 S.Ct. 987. But the point we were making was that <i>Thompson</i> could not excuse a lawyer's original mistake in a case in which a judge had not assured him that his act had been timely; the Court of Appeals in <i>Osterneck</i> had found that no court provided a specific assurance, and we agreed. I see no reason to take <i>Osterneck's</i> language out of context to buttress a fundamentally unfair resolution of an issue the <i>Osterneck</i> Court did not have in front of it. Cf. <i>St. Mary's Honor Center v.

But as Bowles's lawyer pointed out at oral argument, filing the notice of appeal starts the clock for filing the record, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 6(b)(2)(B), which in turn starts the clock for filing a brief, see Rule 31(a)(1), for which counsel might reasonably want as much time as possible. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.

Argued March 26, 2007—Decided June 14, 2007\nHaving failed to file a timely notice of appeal from the Federal District\n Court’s denial of habeas relief, petitioner Bowles moved to reopen the\n filing period pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6),\n which allows a district court to grant a 14-day extension under cer\n tain conditions, see 28 U. S. C. §2107(c). The District Court granted\n Bowles’ motion but inexplicably gave him 17 days to file his notice of\n appeal. He filed within the 17 days allowed by the District Court, but\n after the 14-day period allowed by Rule 4(a)(6) and §2107(c). The\n Sixth Circuit held that the notice was untimely and that it therefore\n lacked jurisdiction to hear the case under this Court’s precedent.\nHeld: Bowles’ untimely notice of appeal—though filed in reliance upon\n the District Court’s order—deprived the Sixth Circuit of jurisdiction.\n Pp. 2–10.\n    (a) The taking of an appeal in a civil case within the time pre\n scribed by statute is “mandatory and jurisdictional.” Griggs v. Provi\n dent Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 61 (per curiam). There is\n a significant distinction between time limitations set forth in a stat\n ute such as §2107, which limit a court’s jurisdiction, see, e.g., Kon\n trick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 453, and those based on court rules,\n which do not, see, e.g., id., at 454. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n 500, 505, and Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 314, distin\n guished. Because Congress decides, within constitutional bounds,\n whether federal courts can hear cases at all, it can also determine\n when, and under what conditions, federal courts can hear them. See\n United States v. Curry, 6 How. 106, 113. And when an “appeal has\n not been prosecuted in the manner directed, within the time limited\n by the acts of Congress, it must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.”\n Id., at 113. The resolution of this case follows naturally from this\n2                          BOWLES v. RUSSELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    reasoning. Because Congress specifically limited the amount of time\n    by which district courts can extend the notice-of-appeal period in\n    §2107(c), Bowles’ failure to file in accordance with the statute de\n    prived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction. And because Bowles’ er\n    ror is one of jurisdictional magnitude, he cannot rely on forfeiture or\n    waiver to excuse his lack of compliance.

We must decide whether the Court of Appeals\nhad jurisdiction to entertain an appeal filed after the\nstatutory period but within the period allowed by the\nDistrict Court’s order. We have long and repeatedly held\nthat the time limits for filing a notice of appeal are juris\ndictional in nature. Accordingly, we hold that petitioner’s\nuntimely notice—even though filed in reliance upon a\nDistrict Court’s order—deprived the Court of Appeals of\njurisdiction.\n                              I\n   In 1999, an Ohio jury convicted petitioner Keith Bowles\nof murder for his involvement in the beating death of Ollie\nGipson. The jury sentenced Bowles to 15 years to life\nimprisonment.      Bowles unsuccessfully challenged his\nconviction and sentence on direct appeal.\n   Bowles then filed a federal habeas corpus application on\nSeptember 5, 2002. On September 9, 2003, the District\nCourt denied Bowles habeas relief. After the entry of final\n2                    BOWLES v. RUSSELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\njudgment, Bowles had 30 days to file a notice of appeal.\nFed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A); 28 U. S. C. §2107(a). He\nfailed to do so. On December 12, 2003, Bowles moved to\nreopen the period during which he could file his notice of\nappeal pursuant to Rule 4(a)(6), which allows district\ncourts to extend the filing period for 14 days from the day\nthe district court grants the order to reopen, provided\ncertain conditions are met. See §2107(c).\n   On February 10, 2004, the District Court granted\nBowles’ motion. But rather than extending the time pe\nriod by 14 days, as Rule 4(a)(6) and §2107(c) allow, the\nDistrict Court inexplicably gave Bowles 17 days—until\nFebruary 27—to file his notice of appeal. Bowles filed his\nnotice on February 26—within the 17 days allowed by the\nDistrict Court’s order, but after the 14-day period allowed\nby Rule 4(a)(6) and §2107(c).\n   On appeal, respondent Russell argued that Bowles’\nnotice was untimely and that the Court of Appeals there\nfore lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The Court of\nAppeals agreed. It first recognized that this Court has\nconsistently held the requirement of filing a timely notice\nof appeal is “mandatory and jurisdictional.” 432 F. 3d 668,\n673 (CA6 2005) (citing Browder v. Director, Dept. of Cor\nrections of Ill., 434 U. S. 257, 264 (1978)). The court also\nnoted that courts of appeals have uniformly held that Rule\n4(a)(6)’s 180-day period for filing a motion to reopen is also\nmandatory and not susceptible to equitable modification.\n432 F. 3d, at 673 (collecting cases). Concluding that “the\nfourteen-day period in Rule 4(a)(6) should be treated as\nstrictly as the 180-day period in that same Rule,” id., at\n676, the Court of Appeals held that it was without juris\ndiction.

Rele\nvant to this case, if certain conditions are met, district\ncourts have the statutory authority to grant motions to\nreopen the time for filing an appeal for 14 additional days.\n§2107(c). Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Proce\ndure carries §2107 into practice. In accord with §2107(c),\nRule 4(a)(6) describes the district court’s authority to\nreopen and extend the time for filing a notice of appeal\nafter the lapse of the usual 30 days:\n     “(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal.\n        “The district court may reopen the time to file an\n     appeal for a period of 14 days after the date when its\n     order to reopen is entered, but only if all the following\n     conditions are satisfied:\n        “(A) the motion is filed within 180 days after the\n     judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after\n     the moving party receives notice of the entry, which\n     ever is earlier;\n        “(B) the court finds that the moving party was enti\n     tled to notice of the entry of the judgment or order\n     sought to be appealed but did not receive the notice\n     from the district court or any party within 21 days af\n     ter entry; and\n        “(C) the court finds that no party would be preju\n     diced.” (Emphasis added.)1\n  It is undisputed that the District Court’s order in this\ncase purported to reopen the filing period for more than 14\ndays.

Indeed, even\nprior to the creation of the circuit courts of appeals, this\nCourt regarded statutory limitations on the timing of\nappeals as limitations on its own jurisdiction. See Scar\nborough v.

Robinson, 361 U. S. 220, 229 (1960), for the proposition\nthat the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional. As the\ndissent notes, we have recently questioned Robinson’s use of the term\n“jurisdictional.” Post, at 2 (opinion of SOUTER, J.) Even in our cases\ncriticizing Robinson, however, we have noted the jurisdictional signifi\ncance of the fact that a time limit is set forth in a statute, see infra, at\n5–6, and have even pointed to §2107 as a statute deserving of jurisdic\ntional treatment. Infra, at 6. Additionally, because we rely on those\ncases in reaching today’s holding, the dissent’s rhetoric claiming that\nwe are ignoring their reasoning is unfounded.\n   Regardless of this Court’s past careless use of terminology, it is\nindisputable that time limits for filing a notice of appeal have been\ntreated as jurisdictional in American law for well over a century.\nConsequently, the dissent’s approach would require the repudiation of a\ncentury’s worth of precedent and practice in American courts. Given\nthe choice between calling into question some dicta in our recent\nopinions and effectively overruling a century’s worth of practice, we\nthink the former option is the only prudent course.\n                  Cite as: 551 U.

Reflecting the consis\ntency of this Court’s holdings, the courts of appeals rou\ntinely and uniformly dismiss untimely appeals for lack of\njurisdiction. See, e.g., Atkins v. Medical Dept. of Augusta\nCty. Jail, No. 06–7792, 2007 WL 1048810 (CA4, Apr. 4,\n2007) (per curiam) (unpublished); see also 15A C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§3901, p. 6 (2d ed. 1992) (“The rule is well settled that\nfailure to file a timely notice of appeal defeats the jurisdic\ntion of a court of appeals”). In fact, the author of today’s\ndissent recently reiterated that “[t]he accepted fact is that\nsome time limits are jurisdictional even though expressed\nin a separate statutory section from jurisdictional grants,\nsee, e.g., . . . §2107 (providing that notice of appeal in civil\ncases must be filed ‘within thirty days after the entry of\nsuch judgment’).” Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S.\n149, 160, n. 6 (2003) (majority opinion of SOUTER, J.,\njoined by STEVENS, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ., inter\nalios) (citation omitted).\n   Although several of our recent decisions have under\ntaken to clarify the distinction between claims-processing\nrules and jurisdictional rules, none of them calls into\nquestion our longstanding treatment of statutory time\nlimits for taking an appeal as jurisdictional. Indeed, those\ndecisions have also recognized the jurisdictional signifi\ncance of the fact that a time limitation is set forth in a\nstatute. In Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443 (2004), we held\nthat failure to comply with the time requirement in Fed\neral Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4004 did not affect a\ncourt’s subject-matter jurisdiction. Critical to our analysis\nwas the fact that “[n]o statute . . . specifies a time limit for\nfiling a complaint objecting to the debtor’s discharge.” 540\nU. S., at 448. Rather, the filing deadlines in the Bank\nruptcy Rules are “ ‘procedural rules adopted by the Court\nfor the orderly transaction of its business’ ” that are “ ‘not\njurisdictional.’ ” Id., at 454 (quoting Schacht v. United\n6                       BOWLES v. RUSSELL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nStates, 398 U. S. 58, 64 (1970)). Because “[o]nly Congress\nmay determine a lower federal court’s subject-matter\njurisdiction,” 540 U. S., at 452 (citing U. S. Const., Art. III,\n§1), it was improper for courts to use “the term ‘jurisdic\ntional’ to describe emphatic time prescriptions in rules of\ncourt,” 540 U. S., at 454. See also Eberhart v. United\nStates, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per curiam). As a point of\ncontrast, we noted that §2107 contains the type of statu\ntory time constraints that would limit a court’s jurisdic\ntion. 540 U. S., at 453, and n. 8.3 Nor do Arbaugh v. Y &\nH Corp., 546 U. S. 500 (2006), or Scarborough v. Principi,\n541 U. S. 401 (2004), aid petitioner. In Arbaugh, the\nstatutory limitation was an employee-numerosity re\nquirement, not a time limit. 546 U. S., at 505. Scarbor\nough, which addressed the availability of attorney’s fees\nunder the Equal Access to Justice Act, concerned “a mode\nof relief . . . ancillary to the judgment of a court” that\nalready had plenary jurisdiction. 541 U. S., at 413.\n   This Court’s treatment of its certiorari jurisdiction also\ndemonstrates the jurisdictional distinction between court-\npromulgated rules and limits enacted by Congress. Ac\ncording to our Rules, a petition for a writ of certiorari\nmust be filed within 90 days of the entry of the judgment\nsought to be reviewed. See this Court’s Rule 13.1. That\n90-day period applies to both civil and criminal cases. But\nthe 90-day period for civil cases derives from both this\nCourt’s Rule 13.1 and 28 U. S. C. §2101(c). We have re\npeatedly held that this statute-based filing period for civil\n——————\n    3 At\n       least one federal court of appeals has noted that Kontrick and\nEberhart “called . . . into question” the “longstanding assumption” that\nthe timely filing of a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement.\nUnited States v. Sadler, 480 F. 3d 932, 935 (CA9 2007). That court\nnonetheless found that “[t]he distinction between jurisdictional rules\nand inflexible but not jurisdictional timeliness rules drawn by Eberhart\nand Kontrick turns largely on whether the timeliness requirement is or\nis not grounded in a statute.” Id., at 936.\n                      Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ncases is jurisdictional. See, e.g., Federal Election Comm’n\nv. NRA Political Victory Fund, 513 U. S. 88, 90 (1994).\nIndeed, this Court’s Rule 13.2 cites §2101(c) in directing\nthe Clerk not to file any petition “that is jurisdictionally\nout of time.” (Emphasis added.) On the other hand, we\nhave treated the rule-based time limit for criminal cases\ndifferently, stating that it may be waived because “[t]he\nprocedural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly\ntransaction of its business are not jurisdictional and can\nbe relaxed by the Court in the exercise of its discre\ntion . . . .” Schacht, supra, at 64.4\n    Jurisdictional treatment of statutory time limits makes\ngood sense. Within constitutional bounds, Congress de\ncides what cases the federal courts have jurisdiction to\nconsider.      Because Congress decides whether federal\ncourts can hear cases at all, it can also determine when,\nand under what conditions, federal courts can hear them.\nSee Curry, 6 How., at 113. Put another way, the notion of\n“ ‘subject-matter’ ” jurisdiction obviously extends to\n“ ‘classes of cases . . . falling within a court’s adjudicatory\nauthority,’ ” Eberhart, supra, at 16 (quoting Kontrick,\nsupra, at 455), but it is no less “jurisdictional” when Con\n——————\n   4 The dissent minimizes this argument, stating that the Court under\n\nstood §2101(c) as jurisdictional “in the days when we used the term\nimprecisely.” Post, at 4, n. 4. The dissent’s apathy is surprising be\ncause if our treatment of our own jurisdiction is simply a relic of the old\ndays, it is a relic with severe consequences. Just a few months ago, the\nClerk, pursuant to this Court’s Rule 13.2, refused to accept a petition\nfor certiorari submitted by Ryan Heath Dickson because it had been\nfiled one day late. In the letter sent to Dickson’s counsel, the Clerk\nexplained that “[w]hen the time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari\nin a civil case . . . has expired, the Court no longer has the power to\nreview the petition.” Letter from William K. Suter, Clerk of Court, to\nRonald T. Spriggs (Dec. 28, 2006). Dickson was executed on April 26,\n2007, without any Member of this Court having even seen his petition\nfor certiorari. The rejected certiorari petition was Dickson’s first in this\nCourt, and one can only speculate as to whether denial of that petition\nwould have been a foregone conclusion.\n8                   BOWLES v. RUSSELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngress forbids federal courts from adjudicating an otherwise\nlegitimate “class of cases” after a certain period has\nelapsed from final judgment.\n  The resolution of this case follows naturally from this\nreasoning. Like the initial 30-day period for filing a notice\nof appeal, the limit on how long a district court may re\nopen that period is set forth in a statute, 28 U. S. C.\n§2107(c).    Because Congress specifically limited the\namount of time by which district courts can extend the\nnotice-of-appeal period in §2107(c), that limitation is more\nthan a simple “claim-processing rule.” As we have long\nheld, when an “appeal has not been prosecuted in the\nmanner directed, within the time limited by the acts of\nCongress, it must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.”\nCurry, supra, at 113. Bowles’ failure to file his notice of\nappeal in accordance with the statute therefore deprived\nthe Court of Appeals of jurisdiction. And because Bowles’\nerror is one of jurisdictional magnitude, he cannot rely on\nforfeiture or waiver to excuse his lack of compliance with\nthe statute’s time limitations. See Arbaugh, supra, at\n513–514.\n                             B\n   Bowles contends that we should excuse his untimely\nfiling because he satisfies the “unique circumstances”\ndoctrine, which has its roots in Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v.\nCherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371 U. S. 215 (1962) (per cu\nriam). There, pursuant to then-Rule 73(a) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure, a District Court entertained a\ntimely motion to extend the time for filing a notice of\nappeal. The District Court found the moving party had\nestablished a showing of “excusable neglect,” as required\nby the Rule, and granted the motion. The Court of Ap\npeals reversed the finding of excusable neglect and, ac\ncordingly, held that the District Court lacked jurisdiction\nto grant the extension. Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMeat Packers, Inc., 303 F. 2d 609, 611–612 (CA7 1962).\nThis Court reversed, noting “the obvious great hardship to\na party who relies upon the trial judge’s finding of ‘excus\nable neglect.’ ” 371 U. S., at 217.\n   Today we make clear that the timely filing of a notice of\nappeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\nBecause this Court has no authority to create equitable\nexceptions to jurisdictional requirements, use of the\n“unique circumstances” doctrine is illegitimate. Given\nthat this Court has applied Harris Truck Lines only once\nin the last half century, Thompson v. INS, 375 U. S. 384\n(1964) (per curiam), several courts have rightly questioned\nits continuing validity. See, e.g., Panhorst v. United\nStates, 241 F. 3d 367, 371 (CA4 2001) (doubting “the con\ntinued viability of the unique circumstances doctrine”).\nSee also Houston v. Lack, 487 U. S. 266, 282 (1988)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“Our later cases . . . effectively\nrepudiate the Harris Truck Lines approach . . .”). See also\nOsterneck v. Ernst & Whinney, 489 U. S. 169, 170 (1989)\n(referring to “the so-called ‘unique circumstances’ excep\ntion” to the timely appeal requirement). We see no com\npelling reason to resurrect the doctrine from its 40-year\nslumber. Accordingly, we reject Bowles’ reliance on the\ndoctrine, and we overrule Harris Truck Lines and Thomp\nson to the extent they purport to authorize an exception to\na jurisdictional rule.\n                               C\n   If rigorous rules like the one applied today are thought\nto be inequitable, Congress may authorize courts to prom\nulgate rules that excuse compliance with the statutory\ntime limits. Even narrow rules to this effect would give\nrise to litigation testing their reach and would no doubt\ndetract from the clarity of the rule. However, congres\nsionally authorized rulemaking would likely lead to less\nlitigation than court-created exceptions without authoriza\ntion. And in all events, for the reasons discussed above,\n10                  BOWLES v.

Thus, although we\nused to call the sort of time limit at issue here “mandatory\nand jurisdictional,” United States v. Robinson, 361 U. S.\n220, 229 (1960), we have recently and repeatedly corrected\nthat designation as a misuse of the “jurisdiction” label.\nArbaugh, supra, at 510 (citing Robinson as an example of\nimproper use of the term “jurisdiction”); Eberhart v.\nUnited States, 546 U. S. 12, 17–18 (2005) (per curiam)\n(same); Kontrick, supra, at 454 (same).\n   But one would never guess this from reading the Court’s\nopinion in this case, which suddenly restores Robinson’s\nindiscriminate use of the “mandatory and jurisdictional”\nlabel to good law in the face of three unanimous repudia\ntions of Robinson’s error. See ante, at 4. This is puzzling,\nthe more so because our recent (and, I repeat, unanimous)\nefforts to confine jurisdictional rulings to jurisdiction\nproper were obviously sound, and the majority makes no\nattempt to show they were not.1\n   The stakes are high in treating time limits as jurisdic\ntional.

But if a limit is taken to be jurisdictional,\nwaiver becomes impossible, meritorious excuse irrelevant\n(unless the statute so provides), and sua sponte considera\ntion in the courts of appeals mandatory, see Arbaugh,\nsupra, at 514.2 As the Court recognizes, ante, at 5–6, this\nis no way to regard time limits set out in a court rule\nrather than a statute, see Kontrick, supra, at 452 (“Only\nCongress may determine a lower federal court’s subject-\nmatter jurisdiction”). But neither is jurisdictional treat\nment automatic when a time limit is statutory, as it is in\nthis case. Generally speaking, limits on the reach of fed\neral statutes, even nontemporal ones, are only jurisdic\ntional if Congress says so: “when Congress does not rank a\nstatutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts\nshould treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in charac\nter.” Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 516. Thus, we have held “that\ntime prescriptions, however emphatic, ‘are not properly\ntyped “jurisdictional,” ’ ” id., at 510 (quoting Scarborough\nv. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 414 (2004)), absent some juris\ndictional designation by Congress. Congress put no juris\ndictional tag on the time limit here.3\n——————\n   2 The requirement that courts of appeals raise jurisdictional issues\n\nsua sponte reveals further ill effects of today’s decision. Under §2107(c),\n“[t]he district court may . . . extend the time for appeal upon a showing\nof excusable neglect or good cause.” By the Court’s logic, if a district\ncourt grants such an extension, the extension’s propriety is subject to\nmandatory sua sponte review in the court of appeals, even if the exten\nsion was unopposed throughout, and upon finding error the court of\nappeals must dismiss the appeal. I see no more justification for such a\nrule than reason to suspect Congress meant to create it.\n   3 The majority answers that a footnote of our unanimous opinion in\n\nKontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.

Ante, at 6 (“[W]e noted that §2107 con\ntains the type of statutory time constraints that would limit a court’s\njurisdiction. 540 U. S., at 453, and n. 8”). What the majority overlooks,\nhowever, are the post-Kontrick cases showing that §2107(a) can no\nlonger be seen as an example of a jurisdictional time limit.

S.,\nat 455. A filing deadline is the paradigm of a claim-\nprocessing rule, not of a delineation of cases that federal\ncourts may hear, and so it falls outside the class of limita\ntions on subject matter jurisdiction unless Congress says\notherwise.4\n——————\nappeal under the present §2107(a) was first pronounced by this Court\nin Browder v.

Eberhart cited\nBrowder (along with several of the other cases on which the Court now\nrelies) as an example of the basic error of confusing mandatory time\nlimits with jurisdictional limitations, a confusion for which United\nStates v.

S.\n236 (1998)), with Eberhart, supra, at 17–18 (citing those cases as\nexamples of the confusion caused by Robinson’s imprecise language).\nEberhart was followed four months later by Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp.,\n546 U. S. 500 (2006), which summarized the body of recent decisions in\nwhich the Court “clarified that time prescriptions, however emphatic,\nare not properly typed jurisdictional,” id., at 510 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). This unanimous statement of all Members of the\nCourt participating in the case eliminated the option of continuing to\naccept §2107(a) as jurisdictional and it precludes treating the 14-day\nperiod of §2107(c) as a limit on jurisdiction.\n   4 The Court points out that we have affixed a “jurisdiction” label to\n\nthe time limit contained in §2101(c) for petitions for writ of certiorari in\ncivil cases. Ante, at 6–7 (citing Federal Election Comm’n v. NRA\nPolitical Victory Fund, 513 U. S. 88, 90 (1994); this Court’s Rule 13.2).\nOf course, we initially did so in the days when we used the term impre\ncisely. The status of §2101(c) is not before the Court in this case, so I\nexpress no opinion on whether there are sufficient reasons to treat it as\njurisdictional. The Court’s observation that jurisdictional treatment\nhas had severe consequences in that context, ante, at 7, n. 4, does\n                      Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                      5\n\n                          SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\n   The time limit at issue here, far from defining the set of\ncases that may be adjudicated, is much more like a statute\nof limitations, which provides an affirmative defense, see\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c), and is not jurisdictional, Day v.\nMcDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205 (2006). Statutes of limita\ntions may thus be waived, id., at 207–208, or excused by\nrules, such as equitable tolling, that alleviate hardship\nand unfairness, see Irwin v. Department of Veterans Af\nfairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95–96 (1990).\n   Consistent with the traditional view of statutes of limi\ntations, and the carefully limited concept of jurisdiction\nexplained in Arbaugh, Eberhart, and Kontrick, an excep\ntion to the time limit in 28 U. S. C. §2107(c) should be\navailable when there is a good justification for one, for\nreasons we recognized years ago. In Harris Truck Lines,\nInc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371 U. S. 215, 217 (1962)\n(per curiam), and Thompson v. INS, 375 U. S. 384, 387\n(1964) (per curiam), we found that “unique circumstances”\nexcused failures to comply with the time limit. In fact,\nmuch like this case, Harris and Thompson involved dis\ntrict court errors that misled litigants into believing they\nhad more time to file notices of appeal than a statute\nactually provided. Thus, even back when we thoughtlessly\ncalled time limits jurisdictional, we did not actually treat\nthem as beyond exemption to the point of shrugging at the\ninequity of penalizing a party for relying on what a federal\njudge had said to him. Since we did not dishonor reason\nable reliance on a judge’s official word back in the days\nwhen we uncritically had a jurisdictional reason to be\nunfair, it is unsupportable to dishonor it now, after re\npeatedly disavowing any such jurisdictional justification\n\n—————— \n\nnothing to support an argument that jurisdictional treatment is sound, \n\nbut instead merely shows that the certiorari rule, too, should be recon\n\nsidered in light of our recent clarifications of what sorts of rules should \n\nbe treated as jurisdictional. \n\n6                        BOWLES v. RUSSELL\n\n                          SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthat would apply to the 14-day time limit of §2107(c).\n  The majority avoids clashing with Harris and Thompson\nby overruling them on the ground of their “slumber,” ante,\nat 9, and inconsistency with a time-limit-as-jurisdictional\nrule.5 But eliminating those precedents underscores what\nhas become the principal question of this case: why does\ntoday’s majority refuse to come to terms with the steady\nstream of unanimous statements from this Court in the\npast four years, culminating in Arbaugh’s summary a year\nago? The majority begs this question by refusing to con\nfront what we have said: “in recent decisions, we have\nclarified that time prescriptions, however emphatic, ‘are\nnot properly typed “jurisdictional.” ’ ” Arbaugh, 546 U. S.,\nat 510 (quoting Scarborough, 541 U. S., at 414). This\nstatement of the Court, and those preceding it for which it\nstands as a summation, cannot be dismissed as “some\ndicta,” ante, at 4, n. 2, and cannot be ignored on the\nground that some of them were made in cases where the\nchallenged restriction was not a time limit, see ante, at 6.\nBy its refusal to come to grips with our considered state\nments of law the majority leaves the Court incoherent.\n  In ruling that Bowles cannot depend on the word of a\nDistrict Court Judge, the Court demonstrates that no one\nmay depend on the recent, repeated, and unanimous\nstatements of all participating Justices of this Court. Yet\nmore incongruously, all of these pronouncements by the\nCourt, along with two of our cases,6 are jettisoned in a\n\n——————\n  5 With no apparent sense of irony, the Court finds that “ ‘[o]ur later\n\ncases . . . effectively repudiate the Harris Truck Lines approach.’ ” Ante,\nat 9 (quoting Houston v. Lack, 487 U. S. 266, 282 (1988) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting); omission in original). Of course, those “later cases” were\nBrowder and Griggs, see Houston, supra, at 282, which have them\nselves been repudiated, not just “effectively” but explicitly, in Eberhart.\nSee n. 3, supra.\n  6 Three, if we include Wolfsohn v. Hankin, 376 U. S. 203 (1964) (per\n\ncuriam).\n                    Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                  7\n\n                        SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nruling for which the leading justification is stare decisis,\nsee ante, at 4 (“This Court has long held . . .”).\n                               II\n   We have the authority to recognize an equitable excep\ntion to the 14-day limit, and we should do that here, as it\ncertainly seems reasonable to rely on an order from a\nfederal judge.7 Bowles, though, does not have to convince\nus as a matter of first impression that his reliance was\njustified, for we only have to look as far as Thompson to\nknow that he ought to prevail. There, the would-be appel\nlant, Thompson, had filed post-trial motions 12 days after\nthe District Court’s final order. Although the rules said\nthey should have been filed within 10, Fed. Rules Civ.\nProc. 52(b) and 59(b) (1964), the trial court nonetheless\nhad “specifically declared that the ‘motion for a new trial’\nwas made ‘in ample time.’ ” Thompson, 375 U. S., at 385.\nThompson relied on that statement in filing a notice of\nappeal within 60 days of the denial of the post-trial mo\ntions but not within 60 days of entry of the original judg\nment. Only timely post-trial motions affected the 60-day\ntime limit for filing a notice of appeal, Rule 73(a) (1964), so\nthe Court of Appeals held the appeal untimely. We va\ncated because Thompson “relied on the statement of the\nDistrict Court and filed the appeal within the assumedly\nnew deadline but beyond the old deadline.” Id., at 387.\n   Thompson should control. In that case, and this one,\nthe untimely filing of a notice of appeal resulted from\nreliance on an error by a district court, an error that\ncaused no evident prejudice to the other party. Actually,\nthere is one difference between Thompson and this case:\n——————\n  7 As a member of the Federal Judiciary, I cannot help but think that\n\nreliance on our orders is reasonable. See O. Holmes, Natural Law, in\nCollected Legal Papers 311 (1920). I would also rest better knowing\nthat my innocent errors will not jeopardize anyone’s rights unless\nabsolutely necessary.\n8                        BOWLES v. RUSSELL\n\n                          SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nThompson filed his post-trial motions late and the District\nCourt was mistaken when it said they were timely; here,\nthe District Court made the error out of the blue, not on\ntop of any mistake by Bowles, who then filed his notice of\nappeal by the specific date the District Court had declared\ntimely. If anything, this distinction ought to work in\nBowles’s favor. Why should we have rewarded Thompson,\nwho introduced the error, but now punish Bowles, who\nmerely trusted the District Court’s statement?8\n  Under Thompson, it would be no answer to say that\nBowles’s trust was unreasonable because the 14-day limit\nwas clear and counsel should have checked the judge’s\narithmetic. The 10-day limit on post-trial motions was no\nless pellucid in Thompson, which came out the other way.\nAnd what is more, counsel here could not have uncovered\nthe court’s error simply by counting off the days on a\ncalendar. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6)\nallows a party to file a notice of appeal within 14 days of\n“the date when [the district court’s] order to reopen is\nentered.” See also 28 U. S. C. §2107(c)(2) (allowing re\nopening for “14 days from the date of entry”). The District\nCourt’s order was dated February 10, 2004, which reveals\n——————\n   8 Nothing in Osterneck v. Ernst & Whinney, 489 U. S. 169 (1989),\n\nrequires such a strange rule. In Osterneck, we described the “unique\ncircumstances” doctrine as applicable “only where a party has per\nformed an act which, if properly done, would postpone the deadline for\nfiling his appeal and has received specific assurance by a judicial officer\nthat this act has been properly done.” Id., at 179. But the point we\nwere making was that Thompson could not excuse a lawyer’s original\nmistake in a case in which a judge had not assured him that his act had\nbeen timely; the Court of Appeals in Osterneck had found that no court\nprovided a specific assurance, and we agreed. I see no reason to take\nOsterneck’s language out of context to buttress a fundamentally unfair\nresolution of an issue the Osterneck Court did not have in front of it.\nCf. St. Mary’s Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U. S. 502, 515 (1993) (“[W]e\nthink it generally undesirable, where holdings of the Court are not at\nissue, to dissect the sentences of the United States Reports as though\nthey were the United States Code”).\n                      Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                       9\n\n                          SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthe date the judge signed it but not necessarily the date on\nwhich the order was entered. Bowles’s lawyer therefore\ncould not tell from reading the order, which he received by\nmail, whether it was entered the day it was signed. Nor is\nthe possibility of delayed entry merely theoretical: the\nDistrict Court’s original judgment in this case, dated July\n10, 2003, was not entered until July 28. See App. 11\n(District Court docket). According to Bowles’s lawyer,\nelectronic access to the docket was unavailable at the\ntime, so to learn when the order was actually entered he\nwould have had to call or go to the courthouse and check.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 56–57. Surely this is more than eq\nuity demands, and unless every statement by a federal\ncourt is to be tagged with the warning “Beware of the\nJudge,” Bowles’s lawyer had no obligation to go behind the\nterms of the order he received.\n  I have to admit that Bowles’s counsel probably did not\nthink the order might have been entered on a different day\nfrom the day it was signed. He probably just trusted that\nthe date given was correct, and there was nothing unrea\nsonable in so trusting. The other side let the order pass\nwithout objection, either not caring enough to make a fuss\nor not even noticing the discrepancy; the mistake of a few\ndays was probably not enough to ring the alarm bell to\nsend either lawyer to his copy of the federal rules and then\noff to the courthouse to check the docket.9 This would be a\ndifferent case if the year were wrong on the District\n\n——————\n  9 At first glance it may seem unreasonable for counsel to wait until\n\nthe penultimate day under the judge’s order, filing a notice of appeal\nbeing so easy that counsel should not have needed the extra time. But\nas Bowles’s lawyer pointed out at oral argument, filing the notice of\nappeal starts the clock for filing the record, see Fed. Rule App.\nProc. 6(b)(2)(B), which in turn starts the clock for filing a brief, see Rule\n31(a)(1), for which counsel might reasonably want as much time as\npossible. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6. A good lawyer plans ahead, and\nBowles had a good lawyer.\n10                  BOWLES v.
