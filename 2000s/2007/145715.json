Low-Beer, Brad M. Snyder, Michael A. Cardozo, Counsel of Record, Corporation Counsel of the City of New York, New York, N.Y., Counsel for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602 <i>et seq.,</i> governs federal courts' jurisdiction in lawsuits against foreign sovereigns. Today, we must decide whether the FSIA provides immunity to a foreign sovereign from a lawsuit to declare the validity of tax liens on property held by the sovereign for the purpose of housing its employees. We hold that the FSIA does not immunize a foreign sovereign from such a suit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations is located in a 26-floor building in New York City that is owned by the Government of India. Several floors are used for diplomatic offices, but approximately 20 floors contain residential units for diplomatic employees of the mission and their families. The employees\u0097 all of whom are below the rank of Head of Mission or Ambassador\u0097are Indian citizens who receive housing from the mission rent free.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Mongolia is housed in a six-story building in New York City that is owned by the Mongolian Government. Like the Permanent Mission of India, certain floors of the Ministry Building include residences for lower level employees of the Ministry and their families.</p>\n<p>Under New York law, real property owned by a foreign government is exempt from taxation if it is \"used exclusively\" for diplomatic offices or for the quarters of a diplomat \"with the rank of ambassador or minister plenipotentiary\" to the United Nations. N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law Ann. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2355</span> \u00a7 418 (West 2000). But \"[i]f a portion only of any lot or building ... is used exclusively for the purposes herein described, then such portion only shall be exempt and the remainder shall be subject to taxation ....\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>For several years, the City of New York (City) has levied property taxes against petitioners for the portions of their buildings used to house lower level employees. Petitioners, however, refused to pay the taxes. By operation of New York law, the unpaid taxes eventually converted into tax liens held by the City against the two properties. As of February 1, 2003, the Indian Mission owed about $16.4 million in unpaid property taxes and interest, and the Mongolian Ministry owed about $2.1 million.</p>\n<p>On April 2, 2003, the City filed complaints in state court seeking declaratory judgments to establish the validity of the tax liens.<sup>[1]</sup> Petitioners removed their cases to federal court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(d), which provides for removal by a foreign state or its instrumentality. Once there, petitioners argued that they were immune from the suits under the FSIA's general rule of immunity for foreign governments. \u00a7 1604. The District Court disagreed, relying on the FSIA's \"immovable property\" exception, which provides that a foreign state shall not be immune from jurisdiction in any case in which \"rights in immovable property situated in the United States are in issue.\" \u00a7 1605(a)(4).</p>\n<p>Reviewing the District Court's decision under the collateral order doctrine, a unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 446 F.3d 365 (2006). The Court of Appeals held that the text and purpose of the FSIA's immovable property exception confirmed that petitioners' personal property tax obligations involved \"rights in immovable property.\" It therefore held that the District Court had jurisdiction to consider the City's suits. We granted certiorari, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1144, 166 L.Ed.2d 910 (2007), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>\"[T]he FSIA provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court.\" <i>Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp.,</i> 488 U.S. 428, 439, 109 S.Ct. 683, 102 L.Ed.2d 818 (1989). Under the FSIA, a foreign state is presumptively immune from suit unless a specific exception applies. \u00a7 1604; <i>Saudi Arabia v. Nelson,</i> 507 U.S. 349, 355, 113 S.Ct. 1471, 123 L.Ed.2d 47 (1993). At issue here is the scope of the exception where \"rights in immovable property situated in the United States are in issue.\" \u00a7 1605(a)(4). Petitioners contend that the language \"rights in immovable property\" limits the reach of the exception to actions contesting ownership or possession. The City argues that the exception encompasses additional rights in immovable property, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2356</span> including tax liens. Each party claims international practice at the time of the FSIA's adoption supports its view. We agree with the City.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We begin, as always, with the text of the statute. <i>Limtiaco v. Camacho,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1413, 1418, 167 L.Ed.2d 212 (2007). The FSIA provides: \"A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States ... in any case ... in which ... rights in immovable property situated in the United States are in issue.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(4). Contrary to petitioners' position, \u00a7 1605(a)(4) does not expressly limit itself to cases in which the specific right at issue is title, ownership, or possession. Neither does it specifically exclude cases in which the validity of a lien is at issue. Rather, the exception focuses more broadly on \"rights in\" property. Accordingly, we must determine whether an action seeking a declaration of the validity of a tax lien places \"rights in immovable property... in issue.\"</p>\n<p>At the time of the FSIA's adoption in 1976, a \"lien\" was defined as \"[a] charge or security or incumbrance upon property.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1072 (4th ed.1951). \"Incumbrance,\" in turn, was defined as \"[a]ny right to, or interest in, land which may subsist in another to the diminution of its value....\" <i>Id.,</i> at 908; see also <i>id.,</i> at 941 (8th ed.2004) (defining \"lien\" as a \"legal right or interest that a creditor has in another's property\"). New York law defines \"tax lien\" in accordance with these general definitions. See N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law Ann. \u00a7 102(21) (West Supp.2007) (\"`Tax lien' means an unpaid tax ... which is an encumbrance of real property...\"). This Court, interpreting the Bankruptcy Code, has also recognized that a lienholder has a property interest, albeit a \"nonpossessory\" interest. <i>United States v. Security Industrial Bank,</i> 459 U.S. 70, 76, 103 S.Ct. 407, 74 L.Ed.2d 235 (1982).</p>\n<p>The practical effects of a lien bear out these definitions of liens as interests in property. A lien on real property runs with the land and is enforceable against subsequent purchasers. See 5 Restatement of Property \u00a7 540 (1944). As such, \"a lien has an immediate adverse effect upon the amount which [could be] receive[d] on a sale, ... constitut[ing] a direct interference with the property ....\" <i>Republic of Argentina v. New York,</i> 25 N.Y.2d 252, 262, 303 N.Y.S.2d 644, 250 N.E.2d 698, 702 (1969). A tax lien thus inhibits one of the quintessential rights of property ownership\u0097the right to convey. It is therefore plain that a suit to establish the validity of a lien implicates \"rights in immovable property.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Our reading of the text is supported by two well-recognized and related purposes of the FSIA: adoption of the restrictive view of sovereign immunity and codification of international law at the time of the FSIA's enactment. Until the middle of the last century, the United States followed \"the classical or virtually absolute theory of sovereign immunity,\" under which \"a sovereign cannot, without his consent, be made a respondent in the courts of another sovereign.\" Letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, U.S. Dept. of State, to Acting U.S. Attorney General Phillip B. Perlman (May 19, 1952) (Tate Letter), reprinted in 26 Dept. of State Bull. 984 (1952), and in <i>Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba,</i> 425 U.S. 682, 711, 712, 96 S.Ct. 1854, 48 L.Ed.2d 301 (1976) (App. 2 to opinion of the Court). The Tate Letter announced the United States' decision to join the majority of other countries by adopting the \"restrictive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2357</span> theory\" of sovereign immunity, under which \"the immunity of the sovereign is recognized with regard to sovereign or public acts <i>(jure imperii)</i> of a state, but not with respect to private acts <i>(jure gestionis).</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 711, 96 S.Ct. 1854. In enacting the FSIA, Congress intended to codify the restrictive theory's limitation of immunity to sovereign acts. <i>Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc.,</i> 504 U.S. 607, 612, 112 S.Ct. 2160, 119 L.Ed.2d 394 (1992); <i>Asociacion de Reclamantes v. United Mexican States,</i> 735 F.2d 1517, 1520 (C.A.D.C.1984) (Scalia, J.).</p>\n<p>As a threshold matter, property ownership is not an inherently sovereign function. See <i>Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon,</i> 7 Cranch 116, 145, 3 L.Ed. 287 (1812) (\"A prince, by acquiring private property in a foreign country, may possibly be considered as subjecting that property to the territorial jurisdiction, he may be considered as so far laying down the prince, and assuming the character of a private individual\"). In addition, the FSIA was also meant \"to codify ... the pre-existing real property exception to sovereign immunity recognized by international practice.\" <i>Reclamantes, supra,</i> at 1521 (Scalia, J.). Therefore, it is useful to note that international practice at the time of the FSIA's enactment also supports the City's view that these sovereigns are not immune. The most recent restatement of foreign relations law at the time of the FSIA's enactment states that a foreign sovereign's immunity does not extend to \"an action to obtain possession of or establish a property interest in immovable property located in the territory of the state exercising jurisdiction.\" Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 68(b), p. 205 (1965). As stated above, because an action seeking the declaration of the validity of a tax lien on property is a suit to establish an interest in such property, such an action would be allowed under this rule.</p>\n<p>Petitioners respond to this conclusion by citing the second sentence of Comment <i>d</i> to \u00a7 68, which states that the rule \"does not preclude immunity with respect to a claim arising out of a foreign state's ownership or possession of immovable property but not contesting such ownership or the right to possession.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 207. According to petitioners, that sentence limits the exception to cases contesting ownership or possession. When read in context, however, the comment supports the City. Petitioners ignore the first sentence of the comment, which reemphasizes that immunity does not extend to cases involving the possession of or \"interest in\" the property. <i>Ibid.</i> And the illustrations following the comment make clear that it refers only to claims incidental to property ownership, such as actions involving an \"injury suffered in a fall\" on the property, for which immunity would apply. <i>Id.,</i> at 208. By contrast, for an eminent-domain proceeding, the foreign sovereign could not claim immunity. <i>Ibid.</i> Like the eminent-domain proceeding, the City's lawsuits here directly implicate rights in property.</p>\n<p>In addition, both parties rely on various international agreements, primarily the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, Apr. 18, 1961, [1972] 23 U.S.T. 3227, T.I.A.S. No. 7502, to identify pre-FSIA international practice. Petitioners point to the Vienna Convention's analogous withholding of immunity for \"a real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the receiving State, unless [the diplomatic agent] holds it on behalf of the sending State for the purposes of the mission.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 3240, Art. 31(1)(a). Petitioners contend that this language indicates they are entitled to immunity for two reasons. First, petitioners argue that \"real action[s]\" do not include actions for performance of obligations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2358</span> \"`deriving from ownership or possession of immovable property.'\" Brief for Petitioners 28 (quoting E. Denza, Diplomatic Law: A Commentary on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 238 (2d ed.1998); emphasis deleted). Second, petitioners assert that the property here is held \"`on behalf of the sending State for purposes of the Mission.'\" Brief for Petitioners 28.</p>\n<p>But as the City shows, it is far from apparent that the term \"real action\"\u0097a term derived from the civil law\u0097is as limited as petitioners suggest. See <i>Chateau Lafayette Apartments, Inc. v. Meadow Brook Nat. Bank,</i> 416 F.2d 301, 304, n. 7 (C.A.5 1969). Moreover, the exception for property held \"on behalf of the sending State\" concerns only the case\u0097not at issue here\u0097where local law requires an agent to hold in his own name property used for the purposes of a mission. 1957 Y.B. Int'l L. Comm'n 94-95 (402d Meeting, May 22, 1957); see also <i>Deputy Registrar Case,</i> 94 I.L.R. 308, 313 (D. Ct. The Hague 1980). Other tribunals construing Article 31 have also held that it does not extend immunity to staff housing. See <i>id.,</i> at 312; cf. <i>Intpro Properties (U.K.) Ltd. v. Sauvel,</i> [1983] 1 Q.B. 1019, 1032-1033.</p>\n<p>In sum, the Vienna Convention does not unambiguously support either party on the jurisdictional question.<sup>[2]</sup> In any event, nothing in the Vienna Convention deters us from our interpretation of the FSIA. Under the language of the FSIA's exception for immovable property, petitioners are not immune from the City's suits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Because the statutory text and the acknowledged purposes of the FSIA make it clear that a suit to establish the validity of a tax lien places \"rights in immovable property ... in issue,\" we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice BREYER joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Diplomatic channels provide the normal method of resolving disputes between local governmental entities and foreign sovereigns. See <i>Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon,</i> 7 Cranch 116, 146, 3 L.Ed. 287 (1812). Following well-established international practice, American courts throughout our history have consistently endorsed the general rule that foreign sovereigns enjoy immunity from suit in our courts. See <i>Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,</i> 461 U.S. 480, 486, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983); <i>Nevada v. Hall,</i> 440 U.S. 410, 417, 99 S.Ct. 1182, 59 L.Ed.2d 416 (1979). The fact that the immunity is the product of comity concerns rather than a want of juridical power, see <i>Verlinden B.V.,</i> 461 U.S., at 486, 103 S.Ct. 1962, does not detract from the important role that it performs in ordering our affairs.</p>\n<p>The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) both codified and modified that basic rule. The statute confirms that sovereigns are generally immune from suit in our courts, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604, but identifies seven specific exceptions through which courts may accept jurisdiction, \u00a7 1605(a). None of those exceptions pertains, or indeed makes any reference, to actions brought to establish a foreign sovereign's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2359</span> tax liabilities. Because this is such an action, I think it is barred by the general rule codified in the FSIA.</p>\n<p>It is true that the FSIA contains an exception for suits to resolve disputes over \"rights in immovable property,\" \u00a7 1605(a)(4), and New York City law provides that unpaid real estate taxes create a lien that constitutes an interest in such property, N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 11-301 (Cum.Supp.2006). It follows that a literal application of the FSIA's text provides a basis for applying the exception to this case. See <i>ante,</i> at 2356. Given the breadth and vintage of the background general rule, however, it seems to me highly unlikely that the drafters of the FSIA intended to abrogate sovereign immunity in suits over property interests whose primary function is to provide a remedy against delinquent taxpayers.</p>\n<p>Under the majority's logic, since \"a suit to establish the validity of a lien implicates `rights in immovable property,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 2356, whenever state or municipal law recognizes a lien against a foreign sovereign's real property, the foreign government may be haled into federal court to litigate the validity of that lien. Such a broad exception to sovereign immunity threatens, as they say, to swallow the rule. Under the municipal law of New York City, for example, liens are available against real property, among other things, to compel landowners to pay for pest control, emergency repairs, and sidewalk upkeep. See N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-145, 17-147, 17-151(b) (2000); see also M. Mitzner, Liens and Encumbrances, in Real Estate Titles 299, 311-314 (J. Pedowitz ed.1984). A whole host of routine civil controversies, from sidewalk slip-and-falls to landlord-tenant disputes, could be converted into property liens under local law, and then used\u0097as the tax lien was in this case\u0097to pierce a foreign sovereign's traditional and statutory immunity. In order to reclaim immunity, foreign governments might argue in those cases\u0097just as the Governments of India and the People's Republic of Mongolia tried to argue here\u0097that slip-and-fall claims, even once they are transformed into property liens, do not implicate \"rights in immovable property.\" But the burden of answering such complaints and making such arguments is itself an imposition that foreign sovereigns should not have to bear.</p>\n<p>The force of the arguments of the Solicitor General as <i>amicus curiae</i> supporting petitioners buttresses my conviction that a narrow reading of the statutory exception is more faithful to congressional intent than a reading that enables a dispute over taxes to be classified as a dispute over \"rights in immovable property.\" It is true that insofar as the FSIA transferred the responsibility for making immunity decisions from the State Department to the Judiciary, <i>Verlinden B.V.,</i> 461 U.S., at 487-488, 103 S.Ct. 1962, the views of the Executive are not entitled to any special deference on this issue. But we have recognized that well-reasoned opinions of the Executive Branch about matters within its expertise may have the \"power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\" <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944).</p>\n<p>And I am persuaded. At bottom, this case is not about the validity of the city's title to immovable property, or even the validity of its automatic prejudgment lien. Rather, it is a dispute over a foreign sovereign's tax liability. If Congress had intended the statute to waive sovereign immunity in tax litigation, I think it would have said so.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The City concedes that even if a court of competent jurisdiction declares the liens valid, petitioners are immune from foreclosure proceedings. See Brief for Respondent 40 (noting that there is no FSIA immunity exception for enforcement actions). The City claims, however, that the declarations of validity are necessary for three reasons. First, once a court has declared property tax liens valid, foreign sovereigns traditionally concede and pay. Second, if the foreign sovereign fails to pay in the face of a valid court judgment, that country's foreign aid may be reduced by the United States by 110% of the outstanding debt. See Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006, \u00a7 543(a), 119 Stat. 2214 (hereinafter Foreign Operations); Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, \u00a7 543(a), 118 Stat. 3011 (hereinafter Consolidated Appropriations). Third, the liens would be enforceable against subsequent purchasers. 5 Restatement of Property \u00a7 540 (1944).</p>\n<p>[2]  The City offers several other arguments against immunity based on the Vienna Convention, but those arguments ultimately go to the merits of the case, <i>i.e.,</i> whether petitioners are actually responsible for paying the taxes. Because the only question before us is one of jurisdiction, and because the text and historical context of the FSIA demonstrate that petitioners are not immune from the City's suits, we leave these merits-related arguments to the lower courts.</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued April 24, 2007\u2014Decided June 14, 2007\nUnder New York law, real property owned by a foreign government is\n exempt from taxation when used exclusively for diplomatic offices or\n quarters for ambassadors or ministers plenipotentiary to the United\n Nations. For years, respondent (City) has levied property taxes\n against petitioner foreign governments for that portion of their dip\n lomatic office buildings used to house lower level employees and their\n families. Petitioners have refused to pay the taxes. By operation of\n state law, the unpaid taxes converted into tax liens held by the City\n against the properties. The City filed a state-court suit seeking de\n claratory judgments to establish the liens\u2019 validity, but petitioners\n removed the cases to federal court, where they argued that they were\n immune under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA),\n which is \u201cthe sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state\n in federal court,\u201d Argentine Republic v.

S. C. \u00a71605(a)(4). The Second Circuit af\n firmed, holding that the \u201cimmovable property\u201d exception applied, and\n thus the District Court had jurisdiction over the City\u2019s suits.\nHeld: The FSIA does not immunize a foreign government from a law\n suit to declare the validity of tax liens on property held by the sover\n eign for the purpose of housing its employees. Pp. 3\u20138.\n    (a) Under the FSIA, a foreign state is presumptively immune from\n suit unless a specific exception applies. In determining the immov\n able property exception\u2019s scope, the Court begins, as always, with the\n statute\u2019s text. Contrary to petitioners\u2019 position, \u00a71605(a)(4) does not\n2     PERMANENT MISSION OF INDIA TO UNITED NATIONS v.\n\n                    CITY OF NEW YORK \n\n                         Syllabus \n\n\n    expressly limit itself to cases in which the specific right at issue is ti\n    tle, ownership, or possession, or specifically exclude cases in which a\n    lien\u2019s validity is at issue. Rather, it focuses more broadly on \u201crights\n    in\u201d property. At the time of the FSIA\u2019s adoption, \u201clien\u201d was defined\n    as a \u201ccharge or security or incumbrance upon property,\u201d Black\u2019s Law\n    Dictionary 1072, and \u201cincumbrance\u201d was defined as \u201c[a]ny right to, or\n    interest in, land which may subsist in another to the diminution of its\n    value,\u201d id., at 908. New York law defines \u201ctax lien\u201d in accordance\n    with these general definitions. A lien\u2019s practical effects bear out the\n    definitions of liens as interests in property. Because a lien on real\n    property runs with the land and is enforceable against subsequent\n    purchasers, a tax lien inhibits a quintessential property ownership\n    right\u2014the right to convey. It is thus plain that a suit to establish a\n    tax lien\u2019s validity implicates \u201crights in immovable property.\u201d Pp. 3\u20135.\n       (b) This Court\u2019s reading is supported by two of the FSIA\u2019s related\n    purposes. First, Congress intended the FSIA to adopt the restrictive\n    theory of sovereign immunity, which recognizes immunity \u201cwith re\n    gard to sovereign or public acts (jure imperii) of a state, but not . . .\n    private acts (jure gestionis).\u201d Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Repub\n    lic of Cuba, 425 U. S. 682, 711. Property ownership is not an inher\n    ently sovereign function. The FSIA was also meant to codify the real\n    property exception recognized by international practice at the time of\n    its enactment. That practice supports the City\u2019s view that petitioners\n    are not immune, as does the contemporaneous restatement of foreign\n    relations law. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, on\n    which both parties rely, does not unambiguously support either\n    party, and, in any event, does nothing to deter this Court from its in\n    terpretation.

S. C. \u00a71602 et seq., governs federal courts\u2019 jurisdic\ntion in lawsuits against foreign sovereigns. Today, we\nmust decide whether the FSIA provides immunity to a\nforeign sovereign from a lawsuit to declare the validity of\ntax liens on property held by the sovereign for the purpose\nof housing its employees. We hold that the FSIA does not\nimmunize a foreign sovereign from such a suit.\n                              I\n   The Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations\nis located in a 26-floor building in New York City that is\nowned by the Government of India. Several floors are\nused for diplomatic offices, but approximately 20 floors\ncontain residential units for diplomatic employees of the\nmission and their families. The employees\u2014all of whom\nare below the rank of Head of Mission or Ambassador\u2014\nare Indian citizens who receive housing from the mission\nrent free.\n   Similarly, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Peo\n2     PERMANENT MISSION OF INDIA TO UNITED NATIONS v.\n\n                    CITY OF NEW YORK \n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\nple\u2019s Republic of Mongolia is housed in a six-story building\nin New York City that is owned by the Mongolian Gov\nernment. Like the Permanent Mission of India, certain\nfloors of the Ministry Building include residences for lower\nlevel employees of the Ministry and their families.\n   Under New York law, real property owned by a foreign\ngovernment is exempt from taxation if it is \u201cused exclu\nsively\u201d for diplomatic offices or for the quarters of a diplo\nmat \u201cwith the rank of ambassador or minister plenipoten\ntiary\u201d to the United Nations. N. Y. Real Prop. Tax Law\nAnn. \u00a7418 (West 2000). But \u201c[i]f a portion only of any lot\nor building . . . is used exclusively for the purposes herein\ndescribed, then such portion only shall be exempt and the\nremainder shall be subject to taxation . . . .\u201d Ibid.\n   For several years, the City of New York (City) has levied\nproperty taxes against petitioners for the portions of their\nbuildings used to house lower level employees. Petition\ners, however, refused to pay the taxes. By operation of\nNew York law, the unpaid taxes eventually converted into\ntax liens held by the City against the two properties. As of\nFebruary 1, 2003, the Indian Mission owed about $16.4\nmillion in unpaid property taxes and interest, and the\nMongolian Ministry owed about $2.1 million.\n   On April 2, 2003, the City filed complaints in state court\nseeking declaratory judgments to establish the validity of\nthe tax liens.1 Petitioners removed their cases to federal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        City concedes that even if a court of competent jurisdiction de\nclares the liens valid, petitioners are immune from foreclosure proceed\nings. See Brief for Respondent 40 (noting that there is no FSIA immu\nnity exception for enforcement actions). The City claims, however, that\nthe declarations of validity are necessary for three reasons. First, once\na court has declared property tax liens valid, foreign sovereigns tradi\ntionally concede and pay. Second, if the foreign sovereign fails to pay in\nthe face of a valid court judgment, that country\u2019s foreign aid may be\nreduced by the United States by 110% of the outstanding debt. See\nForeign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appro\npriations Act, 2006, \u00a7543(a), 119 Stat. 2214 (hereinafter Foreign Opera\n                     Cite as: 551 U.

Once\nthere, petitioners argued that they were immune from the\nsuits under the FSIA\u2019s general rule of immunity for for\neign governments. \u00a71604. The District Court disagreed,\nrelying on the FSIA\u2019s \u201cimmovable property\u201d exception,\nwhich provides that a foreign state shall not be immune\nfrom jurisdiction in any case in which \u201crights in immov\nable property situated in the United States are in issue.\u201d\n\u00a71605(a)(4).\n   Reviewing the District Court\u2019s decision under the collat\neral order doctrine, a unanimous panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 446 F. 3d 365\n(2006). The Court of Appeals held that the text and pur\npose of the FSIA\u2019s immovable property exception con\nfirmed that petitioners\u2019 personal property tax obligations\ninvolved \u201crights in immovable property.\u201d It therefore held\nthat the District Court had jurisdiction to consider the\nCity\u2019s suits. We granted certiorari, 549 U. S. ___ (2007),\nand now affirm.\n                            II\n   \u201c[T]he FSIA provides the sole basis for obtaining juris\ndiction over a foreign state in federal court.\u201d Argentine\nRepublic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S. 428,\n439 (1989). Under the FSIA, a foreign state is presump\ntively immune from suit unless a specific exception ap\nplies. \u00a71604; Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U. S. 349, 355\n(1993). At issue here is the scope of the exception where\n\u201crights in immovable property situated in the United\nStates are in issue.\u201d \u00a71605(a)(4). Petitioners contend that\nthe language \u201crights in immovable property\u201d limits the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntions); Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, \u00a7543(a), 118 Stat. 3011\n(hereinafter Consolidated Appropriations). Third, the liens would be\nenforceable against subsequent purchasers. 5 Restatement of Property\n\u00a7540 (1944).\n4   PERMANENT MISSION OF INDIA TO UNITED NATIONS v.\n\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\nreach of the exception to actions contesting ownership or\npossession. The City argues that the exception encom\npasses additional rights in immovable property, including\ntax liens. Each party claims international practice at the\ntime of the FSIA\u2019s adoption supports its view. We agree\nwith the City.\n                              A\n    We begin, as always, with the text of the statute. Lim\ntiaco v. Camacho, 549 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 5).\nThe FSIA provides: \u201cA foreign state shall not be immune\nfrom the jurisdiction of courts of the United States . . . in\nany case . . . in which . . . rights in immovable property\nsituated in the United States are in issue.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71605(a)(4). Contrary to petitioners\u2019 position, \u00a71605(a)(4)\ndoes not expressly limit itself to cases in which the specific\nright at issue is title, ownership, or possession. Neither\ndoes it specifically exclude cases in which the validity of a\nlien is at issue. Rather, the exception focuses more\nbroadly on \u201crights in\u201d property. Accordingly, we must\ndetermine whether an action seeking a declaration of the\nvalidity of a tax lien places \u201crights in immovable property\n. . . in issue.\u201d\n    At the time of the FSIA\u2019s adoption in 1976, a \u201clien\u201d was\ndefined as \u201c[a] charge or security or incumbrance upon\nproperty.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1072 (4th ed. 1951).\n\u201cIncumbrance,\u201d in turn, was defined as \u201c[a]ny right to, or\ninterest in, land which may subsist in another to the\ndiminution of its value . . . .\u201d Id., at 908; see also id., at\n941 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201clien\u201d as a \u201clegal right or\ninterest that a creditor has in another\u2019s property\u201d). New\nYork law defines \u201ctax lien\u201d in accordance with these gen\neral definitions. See N. Y. Real Prop. Tax Law Ann.\n\u00a7102(21) (West Supp. 2007) (\u201c \u2018Tax lien\u2019 means an unpaid\ntax . . . which is an encumbrance of real property . . .\u201d).\nThis Court, interpreting the Bankruptcy Code, has also\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrecognized that a lienholder has a property interest, albeit\na \u201cnonpossessory\u201d interest. United States v. Security\nIndustrial Bank, 459 U. S. 70, 76 (1982).\n   The practical effects of a lien bear out these definitions\nof liens as interests in property. A lien on real property\nruns with the land and is enforceable against subsequent\npurchasers. See 5 Restatement of Property \u00a7540 (1944).\nAs such, \u201ca lien has an immediate adverse effect upon the\namount which [could be] receive[d] on a sale, . . . consti\ntut[ing] a direct interference with the property . . . .\u201d\nRepublic of Argentina v. New York, 25 N. Y. 2d 252, 262,\n250 N. E. 2d 698, 702 (1969). A tax lien thus inhibits one\nof the quintessential rights of property ownership\u2014the\nright to convey. It is therefore plain that a suit to estab\nlish the validity of a lien implicates \u201crights in immovable\nproperty.\u201d\n                              B\n   Our reading of the text is supported by two well-\nrecognized and related purposes of the FSIA: adoption of\nthe restrictive view of sovereign immunity and codification\nof international law at the time of the FSIA\u2019s enactment.\nUntil the middle of the last century, the United States\nfollowed \u201cthe classical or virtually absolute theory of sov\nereign immunity,\u201d under which \u201ca sovereign cannot, with\nout his consent, be made a respondent in the courts of\nanother sovereign.\u201d Letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting\nLegal Adviser, U. S. Dept. of State, to Acting U. S. Attor\nney General Phillip B. Perlman (May 19, 1952) (Tate\nLetter), reprinted in 26 Dept. of State Bull. 984 (1952),\nand in Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba,\n425 U. S. 682, 711, 712 (1976) (App. 2 to opinion of the\nCourt). The Tate Letter announced the United States\u2019\ndecision to join the majority of other countries by adopting\nthe \u201crestrictive theory\u201d of sovereign immunity, under\nwhich \u201cthe immunity of the sovereign is recognized with\n6   PERMANENT MISSION OF INDIA TO UNITED NATIONS v.\n\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\nregard to sovereign or public acts (jure imperii) of a state,\nbut not with respect to private acts (jure gestionis).\u201d Id.,\nat 711. In enacting the FSIA, Congress intended to codify\nthe restrictive theory\u2019s limitation of immunity to sover\neign acts. Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504\nU. S. 607, 612 (1992); Asociacion de Reclamantes v.\nUnited Mexican States, 735 F. 2d 1517, 1520 (CADC 1984)\n(Scalia, J.).\n    As a threshold matter, property ownership is not an\ninherently sovereign function. See Schooner Exchange v.\nMcFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 145 (1812) (\u201cA prince, by acquir\ning private property in a foreign country, may possibly be\nconsidered as subjecting that property to the territorial\njurisdiction, he may be considered as so far laying down\nthe prince, and assuming the character of a private indi\nvidual\u201d). In addition, the FSIA was also meant \u201cto codify\n. . . the pre-existing real property exception to sovereign\nimmunity recognized by international practice.\u201d Reclam\nantes, supra, at 1521 (Scalia, J.). Therefore, it is useful to\nnote that international practice at the time of the FSIA\u2019s\nenactment also supports the City\u2019s view that these sover\neigns are not immune. The most recent restatement of\nforeign relations law at the time of the FSIA\u2019s enactment\nstates that a foreign sovereign\u2019s immunity does not extend\nto \u201can action to obtain possession of or establish a property\ninterest in immovable property located in the territory of\nthe state exercising jurisdiction.\u201d Restatement (Second) of\nForeign Relations Law of the United States \u00a768(b), p. 205\n(1965). As stated above, because an action seeking the\ndeclaration of the validity of a tax lien on property is a suit\nto establish an interest in such property, such an action\nwould be allowed under this rule.\n    Petitioners respond to this conclusion by citing the\nsecond sentence of Comment d to \u00a768, which states that\nthe rule \u201cdoes not preclude immunity with respect to a\nclaim arising out of a foreign state\u2019s ownership or posses\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsion of immovable property but not contesting such owner\nship or the right to possession.\u201d Id., at 207. According to\npetitioners, that sentence limits the exception to cases\ncontesting ownership or possession. When read in context,\nhowever, the comment supports the City. Petitioners\nignore the first sentence of the comment, which reempha\nsizes that immunity does not extend to cases involving the\npossession of or \u201cinterest in\u201d the property. Ibid. And the\nillustrations following the comment make clear that it\nrefers only to claims incidental to property ownership,\nsuch as actions involving an \u201cinjury suffered in a fall\u201d on\nthe property, for which immunity would apply. Id., at 208.\nBy contrast, for an eminent-domain proceeding, the for\neign sovereign could not claim immunity. Ibid. Like the\neminent-domain proceeding, the City\u2019s lawsuits here\ndirectly implicate rights in property.\n   In addition, both parties rely on various international\nagreements, primarily the Vienna Convention on Diplo\nmatic Relations, Apr. 18, 1961, [1972] 23 U. S. T. 3227,\nT. I. A. S. No. 7502, to identify pre-FSIA international\npractice. Petitioners point to the Vienna Convention\u2019s\nanalogous withholding of immunity for \u201ca real action\nrelating to private immovable property situated in the\nterritory of the receiving State, unless [the diplomatic\nagent] holds it on behalf of the sending State for the pur\nposes of the mission.\u201d Id., at 3240, Art. 31(1)(a). Petition\ners contend that this language indicates they are entitled\nto immunity for two reasons. First, petitioners argue that\n\u201creal action[s]\u201d do not include actions for performance of\nobligations \u201c \u2018deriving from ownership or possession of\nimmovable property.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioners 28 (quoting E.\nDenza, Diplomatic Law: A Commentary on the Vienna\nConvention on Diplomatic Relations 238 (2d ed. 1998);\nemphasis deleted). Second, petitioners assert that the\nproperty here is held \u201c \u2018on behalf of the sending State for\npurposes of the Mission.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioners 28.\n8   PERMANENT MISSION OF INDIA TO UNITED NATIONS v.\n\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n   But as the City shows, it is far from apparent that the\nterm \u201creal action\u201d\u2014a term derived from the civil law\u2014is\nas limited as petitioners suggest. See Chateau Lafayette\nApartments, Inc. v. Meadow Brook Nat. Bank, 416 F. 2d\n301, 304, n. 7 (CA5 1969). Moreover, the exception for\nproperty held \u201con behalf of the sending State\u201d concerns\nonly the case\u2014not at issue here\u2014where local law requires\nan agent to hold in his own name property used for the\npurposes of a mission. 1957 Y. B. Int\u2019l L. Comm\u2019n 94\u201395\n(402d Meeting, May 22, 1957); see also Deputy Registrar\nCase, 94 I. L. R. 308, 313 (D. Ct. The Hague 1980). Other\ntribunals construing Article 31 have also held that it does\nnot extend immunity to staff housing. See id., at 312; cf.\nIntpro Properties (U. K.) Ltd. v. Sauvel, [1983] 1 Q. B.\n1019, 1032\u20131033.\n   In sum, the Vienna Convention does not unambiguously\nsupport either party on the jurisdictional question.2 In\nany event, nothing in the Vienna Convention deters us\nfrom our interpretation of the FSIA. Under the language\nof the FSIA\u2019s exception for immovable property, petition\ners are not immune from the City\u2019s suits.\n                              III\n    Because the statutory text and the acknowledged pur\nposes of the FSIA make it clear that a suit to establish the\nvalidity of a tax lien places \u201crights in immovable property\n. . . in issue,\u201d we affirm the judgment of the Court of Ap\npeals and remand the case for further proceedings consis\ntent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The City offers several other arguments against immunity based on\n\nthe Vienna Convention, but those arguments ultimately go to the\nmerits of the case, i.e., whether petitioners are actually responsible for\npaying the taxes. Because the only question before us is one of jurisdic\ntion, and because the text and historical context of the FSIA demon\nstrate that petitioners are not immune from the City\u2019s suits, we leave\nthese merits-related arguments to the lower courts.\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

See Schooner Exchange v.\nMcFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 146 (1812). Following well-\nestablished international practice, American courts\nthroughout our history have consistently endorsed the\ngeneral rule that foreign sovereigns enjoy immunity from\nsuit in our courts. See Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of\nNigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983); Nevada v. Hall, 440\nU. S. 410, 417 (1979). The fact that the immunity is the\nproduct of comity concerns rather than a want of juridical\npower, see Verlinden B. V., 461 U. S., at 486, does not\ndetract from the important role that it performs in order\ning our affairs.\n   The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA)\nboth codified and modified that basic rule. The statute\nconfirms that sovereigns are generally immune from suit\nin our courts, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71604, but identifies seven spe\ncific exceptions through which courts may accept jurisdic\ntion, \u00a71605(a). None of those exceptions pertains, or in\ndeed makes any reference, to actions brought to establish\na foreign sovereign\u2019s tax liabilities. Because this is such\n2   PERMANENT MISSION OF INDIA TO UNITED NATIONS v.\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK\n                 STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nan action, I think it is barred by the general rule codified\nin the FSIA.\n   It is true that the FSIA contains an exception for suits\nto resolve disputes over \u201crights in immovable property,\u201d\n\u00a71605(a)(4), and New York City law provides that unpaid\nreal estate taxes create a lien that constitutes an interest\nin such property, N. Y. C. Admin. Code \u00a711\u2013301 (Cum.\nSupp. 2006). It follows that a literal application of the\nFSIA\u2019s text provides a basis for applying the exception to\nthis case. See ante, at 4\u20135. Given the breadth and vintage\nof the background general rule, however, it seems to me\nhighly unlikely that the drafters of the FSIA intended to\nabrogate sovereign immunity in suits over property inter\nests whose primary function is to provide a remedy\nagainst delinquent taxpayers.\n   Under the majority\u2019s logic, since \u201ca suit to establish the\nvalidity of a lien implicates \u2018rights in immovable prop\nerty,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 5, whenever state or municipal law recog\nnizes a lien against a foreign sovereign\u2019s real property, the\nforeign government may be haled into federal court to\nlitigate the validity of that lien. Such a broad exception to\nsovereign immunity threatens, as they say, to swallow the\nrule. Under the municipal law of New York City, for\nexample, liens are available against real property, among\nother things, to compel landowners to pay for pest control,\nemergency repairs, and sidewalk upkeep. See N. Y. C.\nAdmin. Code \u00a7\u00a717\u2013145, 17\u2013147, 17\u2013151(b) (2000); see also\nM. Mitzner, Liens and Encumbrances, in Real Estate\nTitles 299, 311\u2013314 (J. Pedowitz ed. 1984). A whole host\nof routine civil controversies, from sidewalk slip-and-falls\nto landlord-tenant disputes, could be converted into prop\nerty liens under local law, and then used\u2014as the tax lien\nwas in this case\u2014to pierce a foreign sovereign\u2019s traditional\nand statutory immunity. In order to reclaim immunity,\nforeign governments might argue in those cases\u2014just as\nthe Governments of India and the People\u2019s Republic of\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            3\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nMongolia tried to argue here\u2014that slip-and-fall claims,\neven once they are transformed into property liens, do not\nimplicate \u201crights in immovable property.\u201d But the burden\nof answering such complaints and making such arguments\nis itself an imposition that foreign sovereigns should not\nhave to bear.\n   The force of the arguments of the Solicitor General as\namicus curiae supporting petitioners buttresses my con\nviction that a narrow reading of the statutory exception is\nmore faithful to congressional intent than a reading that\nenables a dispute over taxes to be classified as a dispute\nover \u201crights in immovable property.\u201d It is true that insofar\nas the FSIA transferred the responsibility for making\nimmunity decisions from the State Department to the\nJudiciary, Verlinden B. V., 461 U. S., at 487\u2013488, the\nviews of the Executive are not entitled to any special\ndeference on this issue. But we have recognized that well-\nreasoned opinions of the Executive Branch about matters\nwithin its expertise may have the \u201cpower to persuade, if\nlacking power to control.\u201d Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323\nU. S. 134, 140 (1944).\n   And I am persuaded. At bottom, this case is not about\nthe validity of the city\u2019s title to immovable property, or\neven the validity of its automatic prejudgment lien.\nRather, it is a dispute over a foreign sovereign\u2019s tax liabil\nity. If Congress had intended the statute to waive sover\neign immunity in tax litigation, I think it would have said\nso.\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n",

Cardozo, Counsel of Record, Corporation Counsel of the City of New York, New York, N.Y., Counsel for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602 <i>et seq.,</i> governs federal courts' jurisdiction in lawsuits against foreign sovereigns. Today, we must decide whether the FSIA provides immunity to a foreign sovereign from a lawsuit to declare the validity of tax liens on property held by the sovereign for the purpose of housing its employees. We hold that the FSIA does not immunize a foreign sovereign from such a suit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations is located in a 26-floor building in New York City that is owned by the Government of India. Several floors are used for diplomatic offices, but approximately 20 floors contain residential units for diplomatic employees of the mission and their families. The employees\u0097 all of whom are below the rank of Head of Mission or Ambassador\u0097are Indian citizens who receive housing from the mission rent free.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Mongolia is housed in a six-story building in New York City that is owned by the Mongolian Government. Like the Permanent Mission of India, certain floors of the Ministry Building include residences for lower level employees of the Ministry and their families.</p>\n<p>Under New York law, real property owned by a foreign government is exempt from taxation if it is \"used exclusively\" for diplomatic offices or for the quarters of a diplomat \"with the rank of ambassador or minister plenipotentiary\" to the United Nations. N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law Ann. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2355</span> \u00a7 418 (West 2000). But \"[i]f a portion only of any lot or building ... is used exclusively for the purposes herein described, then such portion only shall be exempt and the remainder shall be subject to taxation ....\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>For several years, the City of New York (City) has levied property taxes against petitioners for the portions of their buildings used to house lower level employees. Petitioners, however, refused to pay the taxes. By operation of New York law, the unpaid taxes eventually converted into tax liens held by the City against the two properties. As of February 1, 2003, the Indian Mission owed about $16.4 million in unpaid property taxes and interest, and the Mongolian Ministry owed about $2.1 million.</p>\n<p>On April 2, 2003, the City filed complaints in state court seeking declaratory judgments to establish the validity of the tax liens.<sup>[1]</sup> Petitioners removed their cases to federal court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(d), which provides for removal by a foreign state or its instrumentality. Once there, petitioners argued that they were immune from the suits under the FSIA's general rule of immunity for foreign governments. \u00a7 1604. The District Court disagreed, relying on the FSIA's \"immovable property\" exception, which provides that a foreign state shall not be immune from jurisdiction in any case in which \"rights in immovable property situated in the United States are in issue.\" \u00a7 1605(a)(4).</p>\n<p>Reviewing the District Court's decision under the collateral order doctrine, a unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794150\"><a href=\"/opinion/794150/the-city-of-new-york-v-the-permanent-mission-of-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span> (2006). The Court of Appeals held that the text and purpose of the FSIA's immovable property exception confirmed that petitioners' personal property tax obligations involved \"rights in immovable property.\" It therefore held that the District Court had jurisdiction to consider the City's suits. We granted certiorari, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1144, 166 L.Ed.2d 910 (2007), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>\"[T]he FSIA provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court.\" <i>Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112174\"><a href=\"/opinion/112174/argentine-republic-v-amerada-hess-shipping-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span>, 439, 109 S.Ct. 683, 102 L.Ed.2d 818 (1989). Under the FSIA, a foreign state is presumptively immune from suit unless a specific exception applies. \u00a7 1604; <i>Saudi Arabia v. Nelson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112834\"><a href=\"/opinion/112834/saudi-arabia-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, 355, 113 S.Ct. 1471, 123 L.Ed.2d 47 (1993). At issue here is the scope of the exception where \"rights in immovable property situated in the United States are in issue.\" \u00a7 1605(a)(4). Petitioners contend that the language \"rights in immovable property\" limits the reach of the exception to actions contesting ownership or possession. The City argues that the exception encompasses additional rights in immovable property, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2356</span> including tax liens. Each party claims international practice at the time of the FSIA's adoption supports its view. We agree with the City.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We begin, as always, with the text of the statute. <i>Limtiaco v. Camacho,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1413, 1418, 167 L.Ed.2d 212 (2007). The FSIA provides: \"A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States ... in any case ... in which ... rights in immovable property situated in the United States are in issue.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(4). Contrary to petitioners' position, \u00a7 1605(a)(4) does not expressly limit itself to cases in which the specific right at issue is title, ownership, or possession. Neither does it specifically exclude cases in which the validity of a lien is at issue. Rather, the exception focuses more broadly on \"rights in\" property. Accordingly, we must determine whether an action seeking a declaration of the validity of a tax lien places \"rights in immovable property... in issue.\"</p>\n<p>At the time of the FSIA's adoption in 1976, a \"lien\" was defined as \"[a] charge or security or incumbrance upon property.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1072 (4th ed.1951). \"Incumbrance,\" in turn, was defined as \"[a]ny right to, or interest in, land which may subsist in another to the diminution of its value....\" <i>Id.,</i> at 908; see also <i>id.,</i> at 941 (8th ed.2004) (defining \"lien\" as a \"legal right or interest that a creditor has in another's property\"). New York law defines \"tax lien\" in accordance with these general definitions. See N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law Ann. \u00a7 102(21) (West Supp.2007) (\"`Tax lien' means an unpaid tax ... which is an encumbrance of real property...\"). This Court, interpreting the Bankruptcy Code, has also recognized that a lienholder has a property interest, albeit a \"nonpossessory\" interest. <i>United States v. Security Industrial Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110811\"><a href=\"/opinion/110811/united-states-v-security-industrial-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 76, 103 S.Ct. 407, 74 L.Ed.2d 235 (1982).</p>\n<p>The practical effects of a lien bear out these definitions of liens as interests in property. A lien on real property runs with the land and is enforceable against subsequent purchasers. See 5 Restatement of Property \u00a7 540 (1944). As such, \"a lien has an immediate adverse effect upon the amount which [could be] receive[d] on a sale, ... constitut[ing] a direct interference with the property ....\" <i>Republic of Argentina v. New York,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></span>, 262, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></span>, 702 (1969). A tax lien thus inhibits one of the quintessential rights of property ownership\u0097the right to convey. It is therefore plain that a suit to establish the validity of a lien implicates \"rights in immovable property.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Our reading of the text is supported by two well-recognized and related purposes of the FSIA: adoption of the restrictive view of sovereign immunity and codification of international law at the time of the FSIA's enactment. Until the middle of the last century, the United States followed \"the classical or virtually absolute theory of sovereign immunity,\" under which \"a sovereign cannot, without his consent, be made a respondent in the courts of another sovereign.\" Letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, U.S. Dept. of State, to Acting U.S. Attorney General Phillip B. Perlman (May 19, 1952) (Tate Letter), reprinted in 26 Dept. of State Bull. 984 (1952), and in <i>Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109448\"><a href=\"/opinion/109448/alfred-dunhill-of-london-inc-v-republic-of-cuba/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span>, 711, 712, 96 S.Ct. 1854, 48 L.Ed.2d 301 (1976) (App. 2 to opinion of the Court). The Tate Letter announced the United States' decision to join the majority of other countries by adopting the \"restrictive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2357</span> theory\" of sovereign immunity, under which \"the immunity of the sovereign is recognized with regard to sovereign or public acts <i>(jure imperii)</i> of a state, but not with respect to private acts <i>(jure gestionis).</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 711, 96 S.Ct. 1854. In enacting the FSIA, Congress intended to codify the restrictive theory's limitation of immunity to sovereign acts. <i>Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112748\"><a href=\"/opinion/112748/republicof-argentina-v-weltover-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, 612, 112 S.Ct. 2160, 119 L.Ed.2d 394 (1992); <i>Asociacion de Reclamantes v.

See <i>Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon,</i> 7 Cranch 116, 145, 3 L.Ed. 287 (1812) (\"A prince, by acquiring private property in a foreign country, may possibly be considered as subjecting that property to the territorial jurisdiction, he may be considered as so far laying down the prince, and assuming the character of a private individual\"). In addition, the FSIA was also meant \"to codify ... the pre-existing real property exception to sovereign immunity recognized by international practice.\" <i>Reclamantes, supra,</i> at 1521 (Scalia, J.). Therefore, it is useful to note that international practice at the time of the FSIA's enactment also supports the City's view that these sovereigns are not immune. The most recent restatement of foreign relations law at the time of the FSIA's enactment states that a foreign sovereign's immunity does not extend to \"an action to obtain possession of or establish a property interest in immovable property located in the territory of the state exercising jurisdiction.\" Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 68(b), p. 205 (1965). As stated above, because an action seeking the declaration of the validity of a tax lien on property is a suit to establish an interest in such property, such an action would be allowed under this rule.</p>\n<p>Petitioners respond to this conclusion by citing the second sentence of Comment <i>d</i> to \u00a7 68, which states that the rule \"does not preclude immunity with respect to a claim arising out of a foreign state's ownership or possession of immovable property but not contesting such ownership or the right to possession.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 207. According to petitioners, that sentence limits the exception to cases contesting ownership or possession. When read in context, however, the comment supports the City. Petitioners ignore the first sentence of the comment, which reemphasizes that immunity does not extend to cases involving the possession of or \"interest in\" the property. <i>Ibid.</i> And the illustrations following the comment make clear that it refers only to claims incidental to property ownership, such as actions involving an \"injury suffered in a fall\" on the property, for which immunity would apply. <i>Id.,</i> at 208. By contrast, for an eminent-domain proceeding, the foreign sovereign could not claim immunity. <i>Ibid.</i> Like the eminent-domain proceeding, the City's lawsuits here directly implicate rights in property.</p>\n<p>In addition, both parties rely on various international agreements, primarily the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, Apr. 18, 1961, [1972] 23 U.S.T. 3227, T.I.A.S. No. 7502, to identify pre-FSIA international practice. Petitioners point to the Vienna Convention's analogous withholding of immunity for \"a real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the receiving State, unless [the diplomatic agent] holds it on behalf of the sending State for the purposes of the mission.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 3240, Art. 31(1)(a). Petitioners contend that this language indicates they are entitled to immunity for two reasons. First, petitioners argue that \"real action[s]\" do not include actions for performance of obligations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2358</span> \"`deriving from ownership or possession of immovable property.'\" Brief for Petitioners 28 (quoting E. Denza, Diplomatic Law: A Commentary on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 238 (2d ed.1998); emphasis deleted). Second, petitioners assert that the property here is held \"`on behalf of the sending State for purposes of the Mission.'\" Brief for Petitioners 28.</p>\n<p>But as the City shows, it is far from apparent that the term \"real action\"\u0097a term derived from the civil law\u0097is as limited as petitioners suggest. See <i>Chateau Lafayette Apartments, Inc. v. Meadow Brook Nat. Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"286603\"><a href=\"/opinion/286603/the-chateau-lafayette-apartments-inc-v-the-meadow-/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span>, 304, n. 7 (C.A.5 1969). Moreover, the exception for property held \"on behalf of the sending State\" concerns only the case\u0097not at issue here\u0097where local law requires an agent to hold in his own name property used for the purposes of a mission. 1957 Y.B. Int'l L. Comm'n 94-95 (402d Meeting, May 22, 1957); see also <i>Deputy Registrar Case,</i> 94 I.L.R. 308, 313 (D. Ct. The Hague 1980). Other tribunals construing Article 31 have also held that it does not extend immunity to staff housing. See <i>id.,</i> at 312; cf. <i>Intpro Properties (U.K.) Ltd. v. Sauvel,</i> [1983] 1 Q.B. 1019, 1032-1033.</p>\n<p>In sum, the Vienna Convention does not unambiguously support either party on the jurisdictional question.<sup>[2]</sup> In any event, nothing in the Vienna Convention deters us from our interpretation of the FSIA. Under the language of the FSIA's exception for immovable property, petitioners are not immune from the City's suits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Because the statutory text and the acknowledged purposes of the FSIA make it clear that a suit to establish the validity of a tax lien places \"rights in immovable property ... in issue,\" we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice BREYER joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Diplomatic channels provide the normal method of resolving disputes between local governmental entities and foreign sovereigns. See <i>Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon,</i> 7 Cranch 116, 146, 3 L.Ed. 287 (1812). Following well-established international practice, American courts throughout our history have consistently endorsed the general rule that foreign sovereigns enjoy immunity from suit in our courts. See <i>Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110932\"><a href=\"/opinion/110932/verlinden-bv-v-central-bank-of-nigeria/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 486, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983); <i>Nevada v. Hall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110034\"><a href=\"/opinion/110034/nevada-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, 417, 99 S.Ct. 1182, 59 L.Ed.2d 416 (1979). The fact that the immunity is the product of comity concerns rather than a want of juridical power, see <i>Verlinden B.V.,</i> 461 U.S., at 486, 103 S.Ct. 1962, does not detract from the important role that it performs in ordering our affairs.</p>\n<p>The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) both codified and modified that basic rule. The statute confirms that sovereigns are generally immune from suit in our courts, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604, but identifies seven specific exceptions through which courts may accept jurisdiction, \u00a7 1605(a). None of those exceptions pertains, or indeed makes any reference, to actions brought to establish a foreign sovereign's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2359</span> tax liabilities. Because this is such an action, I think it is barred by the general rule codified in the FSIA.</p>\n<p>It is true that the FSIA contains an exception for suits to resolve disputes over \"rights in immovable property,\" \u00a7 1605(a)(4), and New York City law provides that unpaid real estate taxes create a lien that constitutes an interest in such property, N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 11-301 (Cum.Supp.2006). It follows that a literal application of the FSIA's text provides a basis for applying the exception to this case. See <i>ante,</i> at 2356. Given the breadth and vintage of the background general rule, however, it seems to me highly unlikely that the drafters of the FSIA intended to abrogate sovereign immunity in suits over property interests whose primary function is to provide a remedy against delinquent taxpayers.</p>\n<p>Under the majority's logic, since \"a suit to establish the validity of a lien implicates `rights in immovable property,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 2356, whenever state or municipal law recognizes a lien against a foreign sovereign's real property, the foreign government may be haled into federal court to litigate the validity of that lien. Such a broad exception to sovereign immunity threatens, as they say, to swallow the rule. Under the municipal law of New York City, for example, liens are available against real property, among other things, to compel landowners to pay for pest control, emergency repairs, and sidewalk upkeep. See N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-145, 17-147, 17-151(b) (2000); see also M. Mitzner, Liens and Encumbrances, in Real Estate Titles 299, 311-314 (J. Pedowitz ed.1984). A whole host of routine civil controversies, from sidewalk slip-and-falls to landlord-tenant disputes, could be converted into property liens under local law, and then used\u0097as the tax lien was in this case\u0097to pierce a foreign sovereign's traditional and statutory immunity. In order to reclaim immunity, foreign governments might argue in those cases\u0097just as the Governments of India and the People's Republic of Mongolia tried to argue here\u0097that slip-and-fall claims, even once they are transformed into property liens, do not implicate \"rights in immovable property.\" But the burden of answering such complaints and making such arguments is itself an imposition that foreign sovereigns should not have to bear.</p>\n<p>The force of the arguments of the Solicitor General as <i>amicus curiae</i> supporting petitioners buttresses my conviction that a narrow reading of the statutory exception is more faithful to congressional intent than a reading that enables a dispute over taxes to be classified as a dispute over \"rights in immovable property.\" It is true that insofar as the FSIA transferred the responsibility for making immunity decisions from the State Department to the Judiciary, <i>Verlinden B.V.,</i> 461 U.S., at 487-488, 103 S.Ct. 1962, the views of the Executive are not entitled to any special deference on this issue. But we have recognized that well-reasoned opinions of the Executive Branch about matters within its expertise may have the \"power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\" <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944).</p>\n<p>And I am persuaded. At bottom, this case is not about the validity of the city's title to immovable property, or even the validity of its automatic prejudgment lien. Rather, it is a dispute over a foreign sovereign's tax liability. If Congress had intended the statute to waive sovereign immunity in tax litigation, I think it would have said so.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The City concedes that even if a court of competent jurisdiction declares the liens valid, petitioners are immune from foreclosure proceedings. See Brief for Respondent 40 (noting that there is no FSIA immunity exception for enforcement actions). The City claims, however, that the declarations of validity are necessary for three reasons. First, once a court has declared property tax liens valid, foreign sovereigns traditionally concede and pay. Second, if the foreign sovereign fails to pay in the face of a valid court judgment, that country's foreign aid may be reduced by the United States by 110% of the outstanding debt.
