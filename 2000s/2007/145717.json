The question before us is whether, in light of the statute's text and history, and a different (apparently conflicting) regulation, the Department's regulation is valid and binding. See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In 1974, Congress amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA or Act), 52 Stat. 1060, to include many \"domestic service\" employees not previously subject to its minimum wage and maximum hour requirements. See Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 (1974 Amendments), \u00a7\u00a7 7(b)(1), (2), 88 Stat. 62 (adding 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(f), which provides for a minimum wage for domestic service employees, and \u00a7 207(<i>l</i>), which extends overtime restrictions to domestic service employees). When doing so, Congress simultaneously created an exemption that <i>excluded</i> from FLSA coverage certain subsets of employees \"employed in domestic service employment,\" including babysitters \"employed on a casual basis\" and the companionship workers described above. \u00a7 7(b)(3), 88 Stat. 62, (codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(15)).</p>\n<p>The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) then promulgated a set of regulations that included two regulations at issue here. The first, set forth in a subpart of the proposed regulations entitled \"General Regulations,\" defines the statutory term \"domestic service employment\" as</p>\n<blockquote>\"services of a household nature performed by an employee in or about a private home ... <i>of the person by whom he or she is employed</i> ... such as cooks, waiters, butlers, valets, maids, housekeepers, governesses, nurses, janitors, laundresses, caretakers, handymen, gardeners, footmen, grooms, and chauffeurs of automobiles for family use [as well as] babysitters employed on other than a casual basis.\" 40 Fed.Reg. 7405 (1975) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2345</span> (emphasis added) (codified at 29 CFR \u00a7 552.3).</blockquote>\n<p>The second, set forth in a later subsection entitled \"Interpretations,\" says that exempt companionship workers include those</p>\n<blockquote>\"who are employed by an employer or agency other than the family or household using their services ... [whether or not] such an employee [is assigned] to more than one household or family in the same workweek ... .\" 40 Fed.Reg. 7407 (codified at 29 CFR \u00a7 552.109(a)).</blockquote>\n<p>This latter regulation (which we shall call the \"third-party regulation\") has proved controversial in recent years. On at least three separate occasions during the past 15 years, the Department considered changing the regulation and narrowing the exemption in order to bring within the scope of the FLSA's wage and hour coverage companionship workers paid by third parties (other than family members of persons receiving the services, who under the proposals were to remain exempt). 58 Fed.Reg. 69310-69312 (1993); 60 Fed. Reg. 46798 (1995); 66 Fed.Reg. 5481, 5485 (2001). But the Department ultimately decided not to make any change. 67 Fed. Reg. 16668 (2002).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In April 2002, Evelyn Coke (respondent), a domestic worker who provides \"companionship services\" to elderly and infirm men and women, brought this lawsuit against her former employer, Long Island Care at Home, Ltd., and its owner, Maryann Osborne (petitioners). App. 1, 19; 267 F.Supp.2d 332, 333-334 (E.D.N.Y. 2003). She alleged that the petitioners failed to pay her the minimum wages and overtime wages to which she was entitled under the FLSA and a New York statute, and she sought a judgment for those unpaid wages. App. 21-22. All parties assume for present purposes that the FLSA entitles Coke to the payments if, but only if, the statutory exemption for \"companionship services\" does not apply to companionship workers paid by third-party agencies such as Long Island Care. The District Court found the Department's third-party regulation valid and controlling, and it consequently dismissed Coke's lawsuit. 267 F.Supp.2d, at 341.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Second Circuit found the Department's third-party regulation \"unenforceable\" and set aside the District Court's judgment. 376 F.3d 118, 133, 135 (2004). Long Island Care and Osborne sought certiorari. At the Solicitor General's suggestion, we vacated the Second Circuit's decision and remanded the case so that the Circuit could consider a recent DOL \"Advisory Memorandum\" explaining (and defending) the regulation. 546 U.S. 1147, 126 S.Ct. 1189, 163 L.Ed.2d 1125 (2006); App. E to Pet. for Cert. 50a (Wage and Hour Advisory Memorandum No.2005-1 (Dec. 1, 2005) (hereinafter Advisory Memorandum)). The memorandum failed to convince the Second Circuit, which again held the regulation unenforceable. 462 F.3d 48, 50-52 (2006) <i>(per curiam).</i> Long Island Care and Osborne again sought certiorari. And this time, we granted their petition and set the case for argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We have previously pointed out that the \"`power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created... program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.'\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S., at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (quoting <i>Morton v. Ruiz,</i> 415 U.S. 199, 231, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974); omission in original). When an agency fills such a \"gap\" reasonably, and in accordance with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2346</span> other applicable (<i>e.g.,</i> procedural) requirements, the courts accept the result as legally binding. 467 U.S., at 843-844, 104 S.Ct. 2778; <i>United States v. Mead Corp.,</i> 533 U.S. 218, 227, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001).</p>\n<p>In this case, the FLSA explicitly leaves gaps, for example as to the scope and definition of statutory terms such as \"domestic service employment\" and \"companionship services.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(15). It provides the Department of Labor with the power to fill these gaps through rules and regulations. <i>Ibid.;</i> 1974 Amendments, \u00a7 29(b), 88 Stat. 76 (authorizing the Secretary of Labor \"to prescribe necessary rules, regulations, and orders with regard to the amendments made by this Act\"). The subject matter of the regulation in question concerns a matter in respect to which the agency is expert, and it concerns an interstitial matter, <i>i.e.,</i> a portion of a broader definition, the details of which, as we said, Congress entrusted the agency to work out.</p>\n<p>The Department focused fully upon the matter in question. It gave notice, it proposed regulations, it received public comment, and it issued final regulations in light of that comment. 39 Fed.Reg. 35383 (1974); 40 Fed.Reg. 7404. See <i>Mead, supra,</i> at 230, 121 S.Ct. 2164. The resulting regulation says that employees who provide \"companionship services\" fall within the terms of the statutory exemption irrespective of who pays them. Since on its face the regulation seems to fill a statutory gap, one might ask what precisely is it about the regulation that might make it unreasonable or otherwise unlawful?</p>\n<p>Respondent argues, and the Second Circuit concluded, that a thorough examination of the regulation's content, its method of promulgation, and its context reveals serious legal problems\u0097problems that led the Second Circuit to conclude that the regulation was unenforceable. In particular, respondent claims that the regulation falls outside the scope of Congress' delegation; that it is inconsistent with another, legally governing regulation; that it is an \"interpretive\" regulation not warranting judicial deference; and that it was improperly promulgated. We shall examine each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Respondent refers to the statute's language exempting from FLSA coverage those \"employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for individuals who (because of age or infirmity) are unable to care for themselves.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(15). She claims that the words \"domestic service employment\" limit the provision's scope to those workers employed by persons who themselves receive the services (or are part of that person's household) and exclude those who are employed by \"third parties.\" And she advances several arguments in favor of this position.</p>\n<p>Respondent points to the overall purpose of the 1974 Amendments, namely to <i>extend</i> FLSA coverage, see, <i>e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 93-232, pp. 2, 8 (1973); she notes that prior to the amendments the FLSA already covered companionship workers employed by certain third parties (<i>e.g.,</i> private agencies that were large enough, in terms of annual sales, to qualify for the FLSA's \"enterprise coverage\" provisions, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206(a), 207(a)(1) (1970 ed.), see \u00a7\u00a7 203(r), (s)(1) (defining \"enterprise\" and \"enterprise engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce\")); and she concludes that Congress must therefore have meant its \"domestic service employment\" language in the exemption to apply only to persons not employed by third parties such as Long Island Care. Respondent tries to bolster this argument <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2347</span> by pointing to statements made by some Members of Congress during floor debates over the 1974 Amendments. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 119 Cong. Rec. 24801 (1973) (statement of Sen. Burdick) (\"I am not concerned about the professional domestic who does this as a daily living,\" but rather about \"people who might have an aged father, an aged mother, an infirm father, an infirm mother, and a neighbor comes in and sits with them\"). And she also points to a different statute, the Social Security statute, which defines \"domestic service employment\" as domestic work performed in \"a private home <i>of the employer.</i>\" 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3510(c)(1) (2000 ed.) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>We do not find these arguments convincing. The statutory language refers broadly to \"domestic service employment\" and to \"companionship services.\" It expressly instructs the agency to work out the details of those broad definitions. And whether to include workers paid by third parties within the scope of the definitions is one of those details.</p>\n<p>Although the FLSA in 1974 already covered <i>some</i> of the third-party-paid workers, it did not at that point cover others. It did not cover, for example, companionship workers employed directly by the aged person's family; nor did it cover workers employed by many smaller private agencies. The result is that whether, or how, the definition should apply to workers paid by third parties raises a set of complex questions. Should the FLSA cover <i>all</i> companionship workers paid by third parties? Or should the FLSA cover <i>some</i> such companionship workers, perhaps those working for some (say, large but not small) private agencies, or those hired by a son or daughter to help an aged or infirm mother living in a distant city? Should it cover <i>none</i>? How should one weigh the need for a simple, uniform application of the exemption against the fact that some (but not all) third-party employees were previously covered? Satisfactory answers to such questions may well turn upon the kind of thorough knowledge of the subject matter and ability to consult at length with affected parties that an agency, such as the Department of Labor, possesses. And it is consequently reasonable to infer (and we do infer) that Congress intended its broad grant of definitional authority to the Department to include the authority to answer these kinds of questions.</p>\n<p>Because respondent refers to the Social Security statute and the legislative history, we add that unlike the text of the Social Security statute, the text of the FLSA does not expressly answer the third-party-employment question. Compare 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3510(c)(1) with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(15). Nor can one find any clear answer in the statute's legislative history. Compare 119 Cong. Rec. 24801 (statement of Sen. Burdick, quoted above), with, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 24798 (statement of Sen. Johnston) (expressing concern that requiring payment of minimum wage to companionship workers might make such services so expensive that some people would be forced to leave the work force in order to take care of aged or infirm parents).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondent says that the third-party regulation conflicts with the Department's \"General Regulation\" that defines the statutory term \"domestic service employment.\" Title 29 CFR \u00a7 552.3 says that the term covers services \"of a household nature performed by ... employee[s]\" ranging from \"maids\" to \"cooks\" to \"housekeepers\" to \"caretakers\" and others, \"in or about a private home ... <i>of the person by whom he or she is employed</i>\" (emphasis added). See also \u00a7 552.101(a). A companionship worker employed by a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2348</span> third party to work at the home of an aged or infirm man or woman is not working at the \"home ... of the person by whom he or she is employed\" (<i>i.e.,</i> she is not working at the home of the third-party employer). Hence, the two regulations are inconsistent, for the one limits the definition of \"domestic service employee\" for purposes of the 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(15) exemption to workers employed by the household, but the other includes in the subclass of exempt companionship workers persons who are <i>not</i> employed by the household. Respondent adds that, given the conflict, the former \"General Regulation\" must govern (primarily because, in her view, only the former regulation is entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference, an issue we address in Part II-C, <i>infra</i>).</p>\n<p>Respondent is correct when she says that the literal language of the two regulations conflicts as to whether workers paid by third parties are included within the statutory exemption. The question remains, however, which regulation governs in light of this conflict. The Department, in its Advisory Memorandum, suggests that the third-party regulation governs, and we agree, for several reasons.</p>\n<p>First, if we were to decide the contrary, <i>i.e.,</i> that the text of the General Regulation, 29 CFR \u00a7 552.3, controls on the issue of third-party employment, our interpretation would create serious problems. Although \u00a7 552.3 states that it is supplying a definition of \"domestic service employment\" only \"[a]s [that term is] used\" in the statutory exemption, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(15), the rule appears in other ways to have been meant to supply a definition of \"domestic service employment\" for the FLSA as a whole (a prospect the Department endorses in its Advisory Memorandum). Why else would the Department have included the extensive list of qualifying professions, virtually none of which have anything to do with the subjects of \u00a7 213(a)(15), babysitting and companionship services? But if we were to apply \u00a7 552.3's literal definition of \"domestic service employment\" (including the \"home ... of the [employer]\" language) across the FLSA, that would place outside the scope of FLSA's wage and hour rules any butlers, chauffeurs, and so forth who are employed by <i>any</i> third party. That result seems clearly contrary to Congress' intent in enacting the 1974 Amendments, particularly if it would withdraw from FLSA coverage all domestic service employees previously covered by the \"enterprise coverage\" provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, \u00a7 552.3's definition of \"domestic service employment\" were limited to the statute's exemption provision, applying this definition literally (by removing all third-party employees from the exemption) would extend the Act's coverage not simply to third-party-employed companionship workers paid by large institutions, but also to those paid directly by a family member of an elderly or infirm person receiving such services whenever the family member lived in a different household than the invalid. Nothing in the statute suggests that Congress intended to make the exemption contingent on whether a family member chose to reside in the same household as the invalid, and it is a result that respondent herself seems to wish to avoid. See Brief for Respondent 34, n. 31.</p>\n<p>Second, normally the specific governs the general. <i>E.g., </i><i>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 504 U.S. 374, 384-385, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992); <i>Simpson v. United States,</i> 435 U.S. 6, 15, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978). The <i>sole purpose</i> of the third-party regulation, \u00a7 552.109(a), is to explain how the companionship services exemption applies to persons employed by third-party entities, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2349</span> whereas the primary (if not sole) purpose of the conflicting general definitional regulation, \u00a7 552.3, is to describe the <i>kind of work</i> that must be performed by someone to qualify as a \"domestic service\" employee. Given that context, \u00a7 552.109(a) is the more specific regulation with respect to the third-party-employment question.</p>\n<p>Third, we concede that the Department may have interpreted these regulations differently at different times in their history. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 58 Fed.Reg. 69311 (employees of a third-party employer qualify for the exemption only if they are also jointly employed \"by the family or household using their services\"); D. Sweeney, DOL Opinion Letter, Home Health Aides/Companionship Exemption, 6A LRR, Wages and Hours Manual 99:8205 (Jan. 6, 1999) (similar). But as long as interpretive changes create no unfair surprise\u0097and the Department's recourse to notice-and-comment rulemaking in an attempt to codify its new interpretation, see 58 Fed.Reg. 69311, makes any such surprise unlikely here\u0097the change in interpretation alone presents no separate ground for disregarding the Department's present interpretation. Cf. <i>Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital,</i> 488 U.S. 204, 212, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988).</p>\n<p>Fourth, we must also concede, as respondent points out, that the Department set forth its most recent interpretation of these regulations in an \"Advisory Memorandum\" issued only to internal Department personnel and which the Department appears to have written in response to this litigation. We have \"no reason,\" however, \"to suspect that [this] interpretation\" is merely a \"`<i>post hoc</i> rationalizatio[n]'\" of past agency action, or that it \"does not reflect the agency's fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\" <i>Auer v. Robbins,</i> 519 U.S. 452, 462, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997) (quoting <i>Bowen, supra</i>). Where, as here, an agency's course of action indicates that the interpretation of its own regulation reflects its considered views\u0097the Department has clearly struggled with the third-party-employment question since at least 1993\u0097we have accepted that interpretation as the agency's own, even if the agency set those views forth in a legal brief. See 519 U.S., at 462, 117 S.Ct. 905.</p>\n<p>For all these reasons, we conclude that the Department's interpretation of the two regulations falls well within the principle that an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is \"controlling\" unless \"`\"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with\"'\" the regulations being interpreted. <i>Id.,</i> at 461, 117 S.Ct. 905 (quoting <i>Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council,</i> 490 U.S. 332, 359, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989), in turn quoting <i>Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.,</i> 325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945)). See also <i>Udall v. Tallman,</i> 380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Respondent also argues that, even if the third-party regulation is within the scope of the statute's delegation, is perfectly reasonable, and otherwise complies with the law, courts still should not treat the regulation as legally binding. Her reason is a special one. She says that the regulation is an \"interpretive\" regulation, a kind of regulation that may be used, not to fill a statutory \"gap,\" but simply to describe an agency's view of what a statute means. That kind of regulation may \"persuade\" a reviewing court, <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944), but will not necessarily \"bind\" a reviewing court. Cf. <i>Mead,</i> 533 U.S., at 232, 121 S.Ct. 2164 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2350</span> (\"interpretive rules ... enjoy no <i>Chevron</i> status <i>as a class</i>\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>Like respondent, the Court of Appeals concluded that the third-party regulation did not fill a statutory gap and hence was not legally binding. 376 F.3d, at 131-133, 462 F.3d, at 50-51. It based its conclusion upon three considerations: First, when the Department promulgated a series of regulations to implement the \u00a7 213(a)(15) exemptions, 29 CFR pt. 552, it placed the third-party regulation in Subpart B, entitled \"Interpretations,\" not in Subpart A, entitled \"General Regulations.\" Second, the Department said that regulations 552.3, .4, .5, and .6, all in Subpart A, contained the \"definitions\" that the statute \"require[s].\" Third, the Department initially said in 1974 that Subpart A would \"defin[e] and delimi[t] ... the ter[m] `domestic service employee,'\" while Subpart B would \"se[t] forth ... a statement of general policy and interpretation concerning the application of the [FLSA] to domestic service employees.\" 376 F.3d, at 131-132, 462 F.3d, at 50-51 (quoting 39 Fed.Reg. 35382).</p>\n<p>These reasons do not convince us that the Department intended its third-party regulation to carry no special legal weight. For one thing, other considerations strongly suggest the contrary, namely that the Department intended the third-party regulation as a binding application of its rulemaking authority. The regulation directly governs the conduct of members of the public, \"`affecting individual rights and obligations.'\" <i>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,</i> 441 U.S. 281, 302, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979) (quoting <i>Morton,</i> 415 U.S., at 232, 94 S.Ct. 1055). When promulgating the rule, the agency used full public notice-and-comment procedures, which under the Administrative Procedure Act an agency need not use when producing an \"interpretive\" rule. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3)(A) (exempting \"interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice\" from notice-and-comment procedures). Each time the Department has considered amending the rule, it has similarly used full notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. 58 Fed.Reg. 69310 (1993); 60 Fed. Reg. 46797 (1995); 66 Fed.Reg. 5485 (2001). And for the past 30 years, according to the Department's Advisory Memorandum (and not disputed by respondent), the Department has treated the third-party regulation like the others, <i>i.e.,</i> as a legally binding exercise of its rulemaking authority. App. E to Pet. for Cert. 63a-64a.</p>\n<p>For another thing, the Subpart B heading \"Interpretations\" (and the other indicia upon which the Court of Appeals relied) could well refer to the fact that Subpart B contains matters of detail, interpreting and applying the more general definitions of Subpart A. Indeed, Subpart B's other regulations\u0097involving such matters as employer \"credit[s]\" against minimum wage payments for provision of \"food,\" \"lodging,\" and \"drycleaning,\" 29 CFR \u00a7 552.100(b), and so forth\u0097strongly indicate that such details, not a direct interpretation of the statute's language, are at issue.</p>\n<p>Finally, the ultimate question is whether <i>Congress</i> would have intended, and expected, courts to treat an agency's rule, regulation, application of a statute, or other agency action as within, or outside, its delegation to the agency of \"gap-filling\" authority. Where an agency rule sets forth important individual rights and duties, where the agency focuses fully and directly upon the issue, where the agency uses full notice-and-comment procedures to promulgate a rule, where the resulting rule falls within the statutory grant of authority, and where the rule itself is reasonable, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2351</span> then a court ordinarily assumes that Congress intended it to defer to the agency's determination. See <i>Mead, supra,</i> at 229-233, 121 S.Ct. 2164.</p>\n<p>The three contrary considerations to which the Court of Appeals points are insufficient, in our view, to overcome the other factors we have mentioned, all of which suggest that courts should defer to the Department's rule. And that, in our view, is what the law requires.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>Respondent's final claim is that the 1974 agency notice-and-comment procedure, leading to the promulgation of the third-party regulation, was legally \"defective\" because notice was inadequate and the Department's explanation also inadequate. We do not agree.</p>\n<p>The Administrative Procedure Act requires an agency conducting notice-and-comment rulemaking to publish in its notice of proposed rulemaking \"either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3). The Courts of Appeals have generally interpreted this to mean that the final rule the agency adopts must be \"a `logical outgrowth' of the rule proposed.\" <i>National Black Media Coalition v. FCC,</i> 791 F.2d 1016, 1022 (C.A.2 1986). See also, <i>e.g., </i><i>United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC v. Marshall,</i> 647 F.2d 1189, 1221 (C.A.D.C.1980), cert. denied <i>sub nom. </i><i>Lead Industries Assn., Inc. v. Donovan,</i> 453 U.S. 913, 101 S.Ct. 3148, 69 L.Ed.2d 997 (1981); <i>South Terminal Corp. v. EPA,</i> 504 F.2d 646, 659 (C.A.1 1974). The object, in short, is one of fair notice.</p>\n<p>Initially the Department proposed a rule of the kind that respondent seeks, namely a rule that would have placed outside the exemption (and hence left subject to FLSA wage and hour rules) individuals employed by third-party employers whom the Act had covered prior to 1974. 39 Fed.Reg. 35385 (companionship workers \"not exempt\" if employed by a third party that already was a \"covered enterprise\" under the FLSA). The clear implication of the proposed rule was that companionship workers employed by third-party enterprises that <i>were not</i> covered by the FLSA prior to the 1974 Amendments (<i>e.g.,</i> most smaller private agencies) <i>would</i> be included within the \u00a7 213(a)(15) exemption.</p>\n<p>Since the proposed rule was simply a proposal, its presence meant that the Department was <i>considering</i> the matter; after that consideration the Department might choose to adopt the proposal or to withdraw it. As it turned out, the Department did withdraw the proposal for special treatment of employees of \"covered enterprises.\" The result was a determination that exempted <i>all</i> third-party-employed companionship workers from the Act. We do not understand why such a possibility was not reasonably foreseeable. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Arizona Public Serv. Co. v. EPA,</i> 211 F.3d 1280, 1299-1300 (C.A.D.C.2000) (notice sufficient where agency first proposed that Indian tribes be required to meet the \"same requirements\" as States with respect to judicial review of Clean Air Act permitting actions, but then adopted a final rule that exempted tribes from certain, though not all, requirements), cert. denied <i>sub nom. </i><i>Michigan v. EPA,</i> 532 U.S. 970, 121 S.Ct. 1600, 149 L.Ed.2d 467 (2001).</p>\n<p>Neither can we find any significant legal problem with the Department's explanation for the change. The agency said that it had \"concluded that these exemptions can be available to such third party employers\" because that interpretation is \"more consistent\" with statutory language that refers to \"`any employee' engaged `in' the enumerated services\" and with \"prior practices concerning other similarly worded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2352</span> exemptions.\" 40 Fed.Reg. 7405. There is no indication that anyone objected to this explanation at the time. And more than 30 years later it remains a reasonable, albeit brief, explanation. See <i>Global Crossing Telecommunications, Inc. v. Metrophones Telecommunications, Inc.,</i> 550 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1513, 1525, 167 L.Ed.2d 422 (2007).</p>\n<p>Respondent's only contrary argument apparently consists of her claim that the explanation does not take proper account of the statute's reference to \"domestic service employees,\" which term (given the Social Security statute and legislative history) must refer only to those who are paid by the household for whom they provide services. If so, she simply repeats in different form arguments that we have already considered and rejected. See Part II-A, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>For these reasons the Court of Appeals' judgment is reversed, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n</div>",

COKE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 06\u2013593.      Argued April 16, 2007\u2014Decided June 11, 2007\nThe Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 exempted from the\n  minimum wage and maximum hours rules of the Fair Labor Stan\n  dards Act of 1938 (FLSA) persons \u201cemployed in domestic service em\n  ployment to provide companionship services for individuals . . . un\n  able to care for themselves.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7213(a)(15). Under a Labor\n  Department (DOL) regulation labeled an \u201cInterpretatio[n]\u201d (hereinaf\n  ter third-party regulation), the exemption includes those \u201ccompan\n  ionship\u201d workers \u201cemployed by an . . . agency other than the family or\n  household using their services.\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7552.109(a). However,\n  DOL\u2019s \u201cGeneral Regulations\u201d also define the statutory term \u201cdomestic\n  service employment\u201d as \u201cservices of a household nature performed by\n  an employee in or about a private home . . . of the person by whom he\n  or she is employed.\u201d \u00a7552.3 (emphasis added). Respondent, a \u201ccom\n  panionship services\u201d provider to the elderly and infirm, sued peti\n  tioners, her former employer Long Island Care and its owner, seeking\n  minimum and overtime wages they allegedly owed her. The parties\n  assume the FLSA requires the payments only if its \u201ccompanionship\n  services\u201d exemption does not apply to workers paid by third-party\n  agencies such as Long Island Care. The District Court dismissed the\n  suit, finding the third-party regulation valid and controlling. The\n  Second Circuit found the regulation unenforceable and set the judg\n  ment aside.\nHeld: The third-party regulation is valid and binding. Pp. 4\u201316.\n    (a) An agency\u2019s power to administer a congressionally created pro\n gram necessarily requires the making of rules to fill any \u201c \u2018gap\u2019 \u201d left,\n implicitly or explicitly, by Congress. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural\n Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843. When an agency\n fills such a gap reasonably, and in accordance with other applicable\n2            LONG ISLAND CARE AT HOME, LTD. v. COKE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    (e.g., procedural) requirements, that result is legally binding. Id., at\n    843\u2013844. On its face, the third-party regulation seems to fill a statu\n    tory gap. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The regulation does not exceed DOL\u2019s delegated rulemaking au\n    thority. The FLSA explicitly leaves gaps as to the scope and defini\n    tion of its \u201cdomestic service employment\u201d and \u201ccompanionship ser\n    vices\u201d terms, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7213(a)(15), and empowers the DOL to fill\n    these gaps through regulations, 1974 Amendments, \u00a729(b). Whether\n    to include workers paid by third parties is one of the details left to\n    the DOL to work out. Although the pre-1974 FLSA already covered\n    some third-party-paid companionship workers, e.g., those employed\n    by large private enterprises, it did not then cover others, e.g., those\n    employed directly by the aged person\u2019s family or by many smaller\n    private agencies. Thus, whether, or how, the statutory definition\n    should apply to such workers raises a set of complex questions, e.g.,\n    should the FLSA cover all of them, some of them, or none of them?\n    How should the need for a simple, uniform application of the exemp\n    tion be weighed against the fact that some (but not all) of the workers\n    were previously covered? Given the DOL\u2019s expertise, satisfactory an\n    swers to the foregoing questions may well turn upon its thorough\n    knowledge of the area and ability to consult at length with affected\n    parties. It is therefore reasonable to infer that Congress intended its\n    broad grant of definitional authority to the DOL to include the au\n    thority to answer such questions. Respondent\u2019s reliance on the Social\n    Security statute, whose text expressly answers a \u201cthird party\u201d cover\n    age question, and on conflicting statements in the 1974 Amendments\u2019\n    legislative history, is unavailing. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (c) Although the literal language of the third-party regulation and\n    the \u201cGeneral Regulation,\u201d \u00a7552.3, conflicts as to whether third-party\n    paid workers are included within the statutory exemption, several\n    reasons compel the Court to agree with the DOL\u2019s position, set forth\n    in an \u201cAdvisory Memorandum\u201d explaining (and defending) the third-\n    party regulation, that that regulation governs here. First, a decision\n    that \u00a7552.3 controls would create serious problems as to the coverage\n    of particular domestic service employees by the statutory exemption\n    or by the FLSA as a whole. Second, given that the third-party regu\n    lation\u2019s sole purpose is to explain how the companionship services ex\n    emption applies to persons employed by third-party entities, whereas\n    \u00a7552.3\u2019s primary purpose is to describe the kind of work that must be\n    performed to qualify someone as a \u201cdomestic service\u201d employee, the\n    third-party regulation is the more specific with respect to the ques\n    tion at issue and therefore governs, see, e.g., Morales v. Trans World\n    Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 384\u2013385. Third, that the DOL may have\n    interpreted the two regulations differently at different times in their\n                   Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nhistory is not a ground for disregarding the present interpretation,\nwhich the DOL reached after proposing a different interpretation\nthrough notice-and-comment rulemaking, making any unfair sur\nprise unlikely, cf. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204,\n212. Fourth, while the Advisory Memorandum was issued only to\nDOL personnel and written in response to this litigation, this Court\nhas accepted such an interpretation where, as here, an agency\u2019s\ncourse of action indicates that its interpretation of its own regulation\nreflects its considered views on the matter in question and there is no\nreason to suspect that its interpretation is merely a post hoc ration\nalization. Pp. 8\u201311.\n   (d) Several factors compel the Court to reject respondent\u2019s argu\nment that the third-party regulation is an \u201cinterpretation\u201d not meant\nto fill a statutory \u201cgap,\u201d but simply to describe the DOL\u2019s view of\nwhat the FLSA means, and thus is not entitled to Chevron deference,\ncf. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 232. For one thing,\nthe regulation directly governs the conduct of members of the public,\n\u201c \u2018affecting individual rights and obligations.\u2019 \u201d Chrysler Corp. v.\nBrown, 441 U. S. 281, 302. When promulgating the regulation and\nwhen considering amending it, the DOL has always employed full\npublic notice-and-comment procedures, which under the Administra\ntive Procedure Act (APA) need not be used when producing an \u201cinter\npretive\u201d rule, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7553(b)(A). And for the past 30 years, accord\ning to the Advisory Memorandum (and not disputed by respondent),\nthe DOL has treated the regulation as a legally binding exercise of its\nrulemaking authority. For another thing, the DOL may have placed\nthe third-party regulation in Subpart B of Part 552, entitled \u201cInter\npretations,\u201d rather than in Subpart A, \u201cGeneral Regulations,\u201d be\ncause Subpart B contains matters of detail, interpreting and applying\nSubpart A\u2019s more general definitions. Indeed, Subpart B\u2019s other\nregulations\u2014involving, e.g., employer \u201ccredit[s]\u201d against minimum\nwages for provision of \u201cfood,\u201d \u201clodging,\u201d and \u201cdrycleaning\u201d\u2014strongly\nindicate that such details, not a direct interpretation of the statute\u2019s\nlanguage, are at issue. Finally, the Court assumes Congress meant\nand expected courts to treat a regulation as within a delegation of\n\u201cgap-filling\u201d authority where, as here, the rule sets forth important\nindividual rights and duties, the agency focuses fully and directly\nupon the issue and uses full notice-and-comment procedures, and the\nresulting rule falls within the statutory grant of authority and is rea\nsonable. Mead, supra, at 229\u2013233. Pp. 11\u201314.\n   (e) The Court disagrees with respondent\u2019s claim that the DOL\u2019s\n1974 notice-and-comment proceedings were legally \u201cdefective\u201d be\ncause the DOL\u2019s notice and explanation were inadequate. Fair notice\nis the object of the APA requirement that a notice of proposed rule\n4            LONG ISLAND CARE AT HOME, LTD. v. COKE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    making contain \u201ceither the terms or substance of the proposed rule or\n    a description of the subjects and issues involved,\u201d 5 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7553(b)(3). The Circuits have generally interpreted this to mean that\n    the final rule must be a logical outgrowth of the rule proposed. Ini\n    tially, the DOL\u2019s proposed regulation would have placed outside the\n    \u00a7213(a)(15) exemption (and hence left subject to FLSA wage and hour\n    rules) individuals employed by the large enterprise third-party em\n    ployers covered before 1974. Since that was simply a proposal, how\n    ever, its presence meant that the DOL was considering the matter\n    and might later choose to keep the proposal or to withdraw it. The\n    DOL finally withdrew it, resulting in a determination exempting all\n    third-party-employed companionship workers from the FLSA, and\n    that possibility was reasonably foreseeable. There is also no signifi\n    cant legal problem with the DOL\u2019s explanation that its final interpre\n    tation is more consistent with FLSA language. No one seems to have\n    objected to this explanation at the time, and it still remains a reason\n    able, albeit brief, explanation.

COKE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   In 1974, Congress amended the Fair Labor Standards\nAct of 1938 (FLSA or Act), 52 Stat. 1060, to include many\n\u201cdomestic service\u201d employees not previously subject to its\nminimum wage and maximum hour requirements. See\nFair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 (1974 Amend\nments), \u00a7\u00a77(b)(1), (2), 88 Stat. 62 (adding 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7206(f), which provides for a minimum wage for domestic\nservice employees, and \u00a7207(l), which extends overtime\nrestrictions to domestic service employees). When doing\nso, Congress simultaneously created an exemption that\nexcluded from FLSA coverage certain subsets of employees\n\u201cemployed in domestic service employment,\u201d including\nbabysitters \u201cemployed on a casual basis\u201d and the compan\nionship workers described above. \u00a77(b)(3), 88 Stat. 62,\n(codified at 29 U. S. C. \u00a7213(a)(15)).\n   The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) then\npromulgated a set of regulations that included two regula\ntions at issue here. The first, set forth in a subpart of the\nproposed regulations entitled \u201cGeneral Regulations,\u201d de\nfines the statutory term \u201cdomestic service employment\u201d as\n    \u201cservices of a household nature performed by an em\n    ployee in or about a private home . . . of the person by\n    whom he or she is employed . . . such as cooks, waiters,\n    butlers, valets, maids, housekeepers, governesses,\n    nurses, janitors, laundresses, caretakers, handymen,\n    gardeners, footmen, grooms, and chauffeurs of auto\n    mobiles for family use [as well as] babysitters em\n    ployed on other than a casual basis.\u201d 40 Fed. Reg.\n    7405 (1975) (emphasis added) (codified at 29 CFR\n    \u00a7552.3).\nThe second, set forth in a later subsection entitled \u201cInter\npretations,\u201d says that exempt companionship workers\ninclude those\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201cwho are employed by an employer or agency other\n    than the family or household using their services . . .\n    [whether or not] such an employee [is assigned] to\n    more than one household or family in the same work\n    week . . . .\u201d 40 Fed. Reg. 7407 (codified at 29 CFR\n    \u00a7552.109(a)).\n  This latter regulation (which we shall call the \u201cthird\nparty regulation\u201d) has proved controversial in recent\nyears. On at least three separate occasions during the\npast 15 years, the Department considered changing the\nregulation and narrowing the exemption in order to bring\nwithin the scope of the FLSA\u2019s wage and hour coverage\ncompanionship workers paid by third parties (other than\nfamily members of persons receiving the services, who\nunder the proposals were to remain exempt). 58 Fed. Reg.\n69310\u201369312 (1993); 60 Fed. Reg. 46798 (1995); 66 Fed.\nReg. 5481, 5485 (2001). But the Department ultimately\ndecided not to make any change. 67 Fed. Reg. 16668\n(2002).\n                               B\n   In April 2002, Evelyn Coke (respondent), a domestic\nworker who provides \u201ccompanionship services\u201d to elderly\nand infirm men and women, brought this lawsuit against\nher former employer, Long Island Care at Home, Ltd., and\nits owner, Maryann Osborne (petitioners). App. 1, 19; 267\nF. Supp. 2d 332, 333\u2013334 (EDNY 2003). She alleged that\nthe petitioners failed to pay her the minimum wages and\novertime wages to which she was entitled under the FLSA\nand a New York statute, and she sought a judgment for\nthose unpaid wages. App. 21\u201322. All parties assume for\npresent purposes that the FLSA entitles Coke to the pay\nments if, but only if, the statutory exemption for \u201ccompan\nionship services\u201d does not apply to companionship workers\npaid by third-party agencies such as Long Island Care.\nThe District Court found the Department\u2019s third-party\n4        LONG ISLAND CARE AT HOME, LTD. v.

Supp. 2d, at 341.\n   On appeal, the Second Circuit found the Department\u2019s\nthird-party regulation \u201cunenforceable\u201d and set aside the\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment. 376 F. 3d 118, 133, 135 (2004).\nLong Island Care and Osborne sought certiorari. At the\nSolicitor General\u2019s suggestion, we vacated the Second\nCircuit\u2019s decision and remanded the case so that the Cir\ncuit could consider a recent DOL \u201cAdvisory Memorandum\u201d\nexplaining (and defending) the regulation. 546 U. S. 1147\n(2006); App. E to Pet. for Cert. 50a (Wage and Hour Advi\nsory Memorandum No. 2005\u20131 (Dec. 1, 2005) (hereinafter\nAdvisory Memorandum)). The memorandum failed to\nconvince the Second Circuit, which again held the regula\ntion unenforceable. 462 F. 3d 48, 50\u201352 (2006) (per cu\nriam). Long Island Care and Osborne again sought certio\nrari. And this time, we granted their petition and set the\ncase for argument.\n                               II\n  We have previously pointed out that the \u201c \u2018power of an\nadministrative agency to administer a congressionally\ncreated . . . program necessarily requires the formulation\nof policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, im\nplicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\u2019 \u201d Chevron, 467 U. S., at\n843 (quoting Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199, 231 (1974);\nomission in original). When an agency fills such a \u201cgap\u201d\nreasonably, and in accordance with other applicable (e.g.,\nprocedural) requirements, the courts accept the result as\nlegally binding. 467 U.

Ibid.; 1974 Amendments,\n\u00a729(b), 88 Stat. 76 (authorizing the Secretary of Labor \u201cto\nprescribe necessary rules, regulations, and orders with\nregard to the amendments made by this Act\u201d). The subject\nmatter of the regulation in question concerns a matter in\nrespect to which the agency is expert, and it concerns an\ninterstitial matter, i.e., a portion of a broader definition,\nthe details of which, as we said, Congress entrusted the\nagency to work out.\n   The Department focused fully upon the matter in ques\ntion. It gave notice, it proposed regulations, it received\npublic comment, and it issued final regulations in light of\nthat comment. 39 Fed. Reg. 35383 (1974); 40 Fed. Reg.\n7404. See Mead, supra, at 230. The resulting regulation\nsays that employees who provide \u201ccompanionship services\u201d\nfall within the terms of the statutory exemption irrespec\ntive of who pays them. Since on its face the regulation\nseems to fill a statutory gap, one might ask what precisely\nis it about the regulation that might make it unreasonable\nor otherwise unlawful?\n   Respondent argues, and the Second Circuit concluded,\nthat a thorough examination of the regulation\u2019s content,\nits method of promulgation, and its context reveals serious\nlegal problems\u2014problems that led the Second Circuit to\nconclude that the regulation was unenforceable. In par\nticular, respondent claims that the regulation falls outside\nthe scope of Congress\u2019 delegation; that it is inconsistent\nwith another, legally governing regulation; that it is an\n\u201cinterpretive\u201d regulation not warranting judicial defer\nence; and that it was improperly promulgated. We shall\nexamine each of these claims in turn.\n                           A\n  Respondent refers to the statute\u2019s language exempting\nfrom FLSA coverage those \u201cemployed in domestic service\nemployment to provide companionship services for indi\n6        LONG ISLAND CARE AT HOME, LTD. v. COKE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nviduals who (because of age or infirmity) are unable to\ncare for themselves.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7213(a)(15). She claims\nthat the words \u201cdomestic service employment\u201d limit the\nprovision\u2019s scope to those workers employed by persons\nwho themselves receive the services (or are part of that\nperson\u2019s household) and exclude those who are employed\nby \u201cthird parties.\u201d And she advances several arguments in\nfavor of this position.\n   Respondent points to the overall purpose of the 1974\nAmendments, namely to extend FLSA coverage, see, e.g.,\nH. R. Rep. No. 93\u2013232, pp. 2, 8 (1973); she notes that prior\nto the amendments the FLSA already covered companion\nship workers employed by certain third parties (e.g., pri\nvate agencies that were large enough, in terms of annual\nsales, to qualify for the FLSA\u2019s \u201centerprise coverage\u201d\nprovisions, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7206(a), 207(a)(1) (1970 ed.), see\n\u00a7\u00a7203(r), (s)(1) (defining \u201centerprise\u201d and \u201centerprise\nengaged in commerce or the production of goods for com\nmerce\u201d)); and she concludes that Congress must therefore\nhave meant its \u201cdomestic service employment\u201d language in\nthe exemption to apply only to persons not employed by\nthird parties such as Long Island Care. Respondent tries\nto bolster this argument by pointing to statements made\nby some Members of Congress during floor debates over\nthe 1974 Amendments. See, e.g., 119 Cong. Rec. 24801\n(1973) (statement of Sen. Burdick) (\u201cI am not concerned\nabout the professional domestic who does this as a daily\nliving,\u201d but rather about \u201cpeople who might have an aged\nfather, an aged mother, an infirm father, an infirm\nmother, and a neighbor comes in and sits with them\u201d).\nAnd she also points to a different statute, the Social Secu\nrity statute, which defines \u201cdomestic service employment\u201d\nas domestic work performed in \u201ca private home of the\nemployer.\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a73510(c)(1) (2000 ed.) (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted).\n   We do not find these arguments convincing. The statu\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntory language refers broadly to \u201cdomestic service employ\nment\u201d and to \u201ccompanionship services.\u201d It expressly in\nstructs the agency to work out the details of those broad\ndefinitions. And whether to include workers paid by third\nparties within the scope of the definitions is one of those\ndetails.\n   Although the FLSA in 1974 already covered some of the\nthird-party-paid workers, it did not at that point cover\nothers. It did not cover, for example, companionship\nworkers employed directly by the aged person\u2019s family; nor\ndid it cover workers employed by many smaller private\nagencies. The result is that whether, or how, the defini\ntion should apply to workers paid by third parties raises a\nset of complex questions. Should the FLSA cover all com\npanionship workers paid by third parties? Or should the\nFLSA cover some such companionship workers, perhaps\nthose working for some (say, large but not small) private\nagencies, or those hired by a son or daughter to help an\naged or infirm mother living in a distant city? Should it\ncover none? How should one weigh the need for a simple,\nuniform application of the exemption against the fact that\nsome (but not all) third-party employees were previously\ncovered? Satisfactory answers to such questions may well\nturn upon the kind of thorough knowledge of the subject\nmatter and ability to consult at length with affected par\nties that an agency, such as the Department of Labor,\npossesses. And it is consequently reasonable to infer (and\nwe do infer) that Congress intended its broad grant of\ndefinitional authority to the Department to include the\nauthority to answer these kinds of questions.\n   Because respondent refers to the Social Security statute\nand the legislative history, we add that unlike the text of\nthe Social Security statute, the text of the FLSA does not\nexpressly answer the third-party-employment question.\nCompare 26 U. S. C. \u00a73510(c)(1) with 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7213(a)(15). Nor can one find any clear answer in the\n8        LONG ISLAND CARE AT HOME, LTD. v. COKE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute\u2019s legislative history. Compare 119 Cong. Rec.\n24801 (statement of Sen. Burdick, quoted above), with,\ne.g., id., at 24798 (statement of Sen. Johnston) (expressing\nconcern that requiring payment of minimum wage to\ncompanionship workers might make such services so\nexpensive that some people would be forced to leave the\nwork force in order to take care of aged or infirm parents).\n                              B\n   Respondent says that the third-party regulation con\nflicts with the Department\u2019s \u201cGeneral Regulation\u201d that\ndefines the statutory term \u201cdomestic service employment.\u201d\nTitle 29 CFR \u00a7552.3 says that the term covers services \u201cof\na household nature performed by . . . employee[s]\u201d ranging\nfrom \u201cmaids\u201d to \u201ccooks\u201d to \u201chousekeepers\u201d to \u201ccaretakers\u201d\nand others, \u201cin or about a private home . . . of the person by\nwhom he or she is employed\u201d (emphasis added). See also\n\u00a7552.101(a). A companionship worker employed by a third\nparty to work at the home of an aged or infirm man or\nwoman is not working at the \u201chome . . . of the person by\nwhom he or she is employed\u201d (i.e., she is not working at\nthe home of the third-party employer). Hence, the two\nregulations are inconsistent, for the one limits the defini\ntion of \u201cdomestic service employee\u201d for purposes of the 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7213(a)(15) exemption to workers employed by the\nhousehold, but the other includes in the subclass of ex\nempt companionship workers persons who are not em\nployed by the household. Respondent adds that, given the\nconflict, the former \u201cGeneral Regulation\u201d must govern\n(primarily because, in her view, only the former regulation\nis entitled to Chevron deference, an issue we address in\nPart II\u2013C, infra).\n   Respondent is correct when she says that the literal\nlanguage of the two regulations conflicts as to whether\nworkers paid by third parties are included within the\nstatutory exemption. The question remains, however,\n                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich regulation governs in light of this conflict. The\nDepartment, in its Advisory Memorandum, suggests that\nthe third-party regulation governs, and we agree, for\nseveral reasons.\n   First, if we were to decide the contrary, i.e., that the text\nof the General Regulation, 29 CFR \u00a7552.3, controls on the\nissue of third-party employment, our interpretation would\ncreate serious problems. Although \u00a7552.3 states that it is\nsupplying a definition of \u201cdomestic service employment\u201d\nonly \u201c[a]s [that term is] used\u201d in the statutory exemption,\n29 U. S. C. \u00a7213(a)(15), the rule appears in other ways to\nhave been meant to supply a definition of \u201cdomestic ser\nvice employment\u201d for the FLSA as a whole (a prospect the\nDepartment endorses in its Advisory Memorandum). Why\nelse would the Department have included the extensive\nlist of qualifying professions, virtually none of which have\nanything to do with the subjects of \u00a7213(a)(15), babysitting\nand companionship services? But if we were to apply\n\u00a7552.3\u2019s literal definition of \u201cdomestic service employment\u201d\n(including the \u201chome . . . of the [employer]\u201d language)\nacross the FLSA, that would place outside the scope of\nFLSA\u2019s wage and hour rules any butlers, chauffeurs, and\nso forth who are employed by any third party. That result\nseems clearly contrary to Congress\u2019 intent in enacting the\n1974 Amendments, particularly if it would withdraw from\nFLSA coverage all domestic service employees previously\ncovered by the \u201centerprise coverage\u201d provisions of the Act.\n   If, on the other hand, \u00a7552.3\u2019s definition of \u201cdomestic\nservice employment\u201d were limited to the statute\u2019s exemp\ntion provision, applying this definition literally (by remov\ning all third-party employees from the exemption) would\nextend the Act\u2019s coverage not simply to third-party\nemployed companionship workers paid by large institu\ntions, but also to those paid directly by a family member of\nan elderly or infirm person receiving such services when\never the family member lived in a different household\n10       LONG ISLAND CARE AT HOME, LTD. v. COKE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthan the invalid. Nothing in the statute suggests that\nCongress intended to make the exemption contingent on\nwhether a family member chose to reside in the same\nhousehold as the invalid, and it is a result that respondent\nherself seems to wish to avoid. See Brief for Respondent\n34, n. 31.\n  Second, normally the specific governs the general. E.g.,\nMorales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 384\u2013\n385 (1992); Simpson v. United States, 435 U. S. 6, 15\n(1978). The sole purpose of the third-party regulation,\n\u00a7552.109(a), is to explain how the companionship services\nexemption applies to persons employed by third-party\nentities, whereas the primary (if not sole) purpose of the\nconflicting general definitional regulation, \u00a7552.3, is to\ndescribe the kind of work that must be performed by some\none to qualify as a \u201cdomestic service\u201d employee. Given that\ncontext, \u00a7552.109(a) is the more specific regulation with\nrespect to the third-party-employment question.\n  Third, we concede that the Department may have inter\npreted these regulations differently at different times in\ntheir history. See, e.g., 58 Fed. Reg. 69311 (employees of a\nthird-party employer qualify for the exemption only if they\nare also jointly employed \u201cby the family or household\nusing their services\u201d); D. Sweeney, DOL Opinion Letter,\nHome Health Aides/Companionship Exemption, 6A LRR,\nWages and Hours Manual 99:8205 (Jan. 6, 1999) (similar).\nBut as long as interpretive changes create no unfair sur\nprise\u2014and the Department\u2019s recourse to notice-and\ncomment rulemaking in an attempt to codify its new\ninterpretation, see 58 Fed. Reg. 69311, makes any such\nsurprise unlikely here\u2014the change in interpretation alone\npresents no separate ground for disregarding the Depart\nment\u2019s present interpretation. Cf. Bowen v. Georgetown\nUniv. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212 (1988).\n  Fourth, we must also concede, as respondent points out,\nthat the Department set forth its most recent interpreta\n                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of these regulations in an \u201cAdvisory Memorandum\u201d\nissued only to internal Department personnel and which\nthe Department appears to have written in response to\nthis litigation. We have \u201cno reason,\u201d however, \u201cto suspect\nthat [this] interpretation\u201d is merely a \u201c \u2018post hoc rationali\nzatio[n]\u2019 \u201d of past agency action, or that it \u201cdoes not reflect\nthe agency\u2019s fair and considered judgment on the matter\nin question.\u201d Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 462 (1997)\n(quoting Bowen, supra). Where, as here, an agency\u2019s\ncourse of action indicates that the interpretation of its own\nregulation reflects its considered views\u2014the Department\nhas clearly struggled with the third-party-employment\nquestion since at least 1993\u2014we have accepted that inter\npretation as the agency\u2019s own, even if the agency set those\nviews forth in a legal brief. See 519 U. S., at 462.\n   For all these reasons, we conclude that the Depart\nment\u2019s interpretation of the two regulations falls well\nwithin the principle that an agency\u2019s interpretation of its\nown regulations is \u201ccontrolling\u201d unless \u201c \u2018 \u201cplainly errone\nous or inconsistent with\u201d \u2019 \u201d the regulations being inter\npreted. Id., at 461 (quoting Robertson v. Methow Valley\nCitizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 359 (1989), in turn quot\ning Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410,\n414 (1945)). See also Udall v. Tallman, 380 U. S. 1, 16\u201317\n(1965).\n                              C\n   Respondent also argues that, even if the third-party\nregulation is within the scope of the statute\u2019s delegation, is\nperfectly reasonable, and otherwise complies with the law,\ncourts still should not treat the regulation as legally bind\ning. Her reason is a special one. She says that the regula\ntion is an \u201cinterpretive\u201d regulation, a kind of regulation\nthat may be used, not to fill a statutory \u201cgap,\u201d but simply\nto describe an agency\u2019s view of what a statute means.\nThat kind of regulation may \u201cpersuade\u201d a reviewing court,\n12       LONG ISLAND CARE AT HOME, LTD. v. COKE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSkidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944), but\nwill not necessarily \u201cbind\u201d a reviewing court. Cf. Mead,\n533 U. S., at 232 (\u201cinterpretive rules . . . enjoy no Chevron\nstatus as a class\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   Like respondent, the Court of Appeals concluded that\nthe third-party regulation did not fill a statutory gap and\nhence was not legally binding. 376 F. 3d, at 131\u2013133; 462\nF. 3d, at 50\u201351. It based its conclusion upon three consid\nerations: First, when the Department promulgated a\nseries of regulations to implement the \u00a7213(a)(15) exemp\ntions, 29 CFR pt. 552, it placed the third-party regulation\nin Subpart B, entitled \u201cInterpretations,\u201d not in Subpart A,\nentitled \u201cGeneral Regulations.\u201d Second, the Department\nsaid that regulations 552.3, .4, .5, and .6, all in Subpart A,\ncontained the \u201cdefinitions\u201d that the statute \u201crequire[s].\u201d\nThird, the Department initially said in 1974 that Subpart\nA would \u201cdefin[e] and delimi[t] . . .the ter[m] \u2018domestic\nservice employee,\u2019 \u201d while Subpart B would \u201cse[t] forth . . .\na statement of general policy and interpretation concern\ning the application of the [FLSA] to domestic service em\nployees.\u201d 376 F. 3d, at 131\u2013132; 462 F. 3d, at 50\u201351 (quot\ning 39 Fed. Reg. 35382).\n   These reasons do not convince us that the Department\nintended its third-party regulation to carry no special legal\nweight. For one thing, other considerations strongly\nsuggest the contrary, namely that the Department in\ntended the third-party regulation as a binding application\nof its rulemaking authority. The regulation directly gov\nerns the conduct of members of the public, \u201c \u2018affecting\nindividual rights and obligations.\u2019 \u201d Chrysler Corp. v.\nBrown, 441 U. S. 281, 302 (1979) (quoting Morton, 415\nU. S., at 232). When promulgating the rule, the agency\nused full public notice-and-comment procedures, which\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act an agency need\nnot use when producing an \u201cinterpretive\u201d rule. 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7553(b)(A) (exempting \u201cinterpretative rules, general\n                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatements of policy, or rules of agency organization,\nprocedure, or practice\u201d from notice-and-comment proce\ndures). Each time the Department has considered amend\ning the rule, it has similarly used full notice-and-comment\nrulemaking procedures. 58 Fed. Reg. 69310 (1993); 60\nFed. Reg. 46797 (1995); 66 Fed. Reg. 5485 (2001). And for\nthe past 30 years, according to the Department\u2019s Advisory\nMemorandum (and not disputed by respondent), the De\npartment has treated the third-party regulation like the\nothers, i.e., as a legally binding exercise of its rulemaking\nauthority. App. E to Pet. for Cert. 63a\u201364a.\n   For another thing, the Subpart B heading \u201cInterpreta\ntions\u201d (and the other indicia upon which the Court of\nAppeals relied) could well refer to the fact that Subpart B\ncontains matters of detail, interpreting and applying the\nmore general definitions of Subpart A. Indeed, Subpart\nB\u2019s other regulations\u2014involving such matters as employer\n\u201ccredit[s]\u201d against minimum wage payments for provision\nof \u201cfood,\u201d \u201clodging,\u201d and \u201cdrycleaning,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7552.100(b),\nand so forth\u2014strongly indicate that such details, not a\ndirect interpretation of the statute\u2019s language, are at issue.\n   Finally, the ultimate question is whether Congress\nwould have intended, and expected, courts to treat an\nagency\u2019s rule, regulation, application of a statute, or other\nagency action as within, or outside, its delegation to the\nagency of \u201cgap-filling\u201d authority. Where an agency rule\nsets forth important individual rights and duties, where\nthe agency focuses fully and directly upon the issue, where\nthe agency uses full notice-and-comment procedures to\npromulgate a rule, where the resulting rule falls within\nthe statutory grant of authority, and where the rule itself\nis reasonable, then a court ordinarily assumes that Con\ngress intended it to defer to the agency\u2019s determination.\nSee Mead, supra, at 229\u2013233.\n   The three contrary considerations to which the Court of\nAppeals points are insufficient, in our view, to overcome\n14       LONG ISLAND CARE AT HOME, LTD. v. COKE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe other factors we have mentioned, all of which suggest\nthat courts should defer to the Department\u2019s rule. And\nthat, in our view, is what the law requires.\n                             D\n   Respondent\u2019s final claim is that the 1974 agency notice-\nand-comment procedure, leading to the promulgation of\nthe third-party regulation, was legally \u201cdefective\u201d because\nnotice was inadequate and the Department\u2019s explanation\nalso inadequate. We do not agree.\n   The Administrative Procedure Act requires an agency\nconducting notice-and-comment rulemaking to publish in\nits notice of proposed rulemaking \u201ceither the terms or\nsubstance of the proposed rule or a description of the\nsubjects and issues involved.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7553(b)(3). The\nCourts of Appeals have generally interpreted this to mean\nthat the final rule the agency adopts must be \u201ca \u2018logical\noutgrowth\u2019 of the rule proposed.\u201d National Black Media\nCoalition v. FCC, 791 F. 2d 1016, 1022 (CA2 1986). See\nalso, e.g., United Steelworkers of America, AFL\u2013CIO\u2013CLC\nv. Marshall, 647 F. 2d 1189, 1221 (CADC 1980), cert.\ndenied sub nom. Lead Industries Assn., Inc. v. Donovan,\n453 U. S. 913 (1981); South Terminal Corp. v. EPA, 504\nF. 2d 646, 659 (CA1 1974). The object, in short, is one of\nfair notice.\n   Initially the Department proposed a rule of the kind\nthat respondent seeks, namely a rule that would have\nplaced outside the exemption (and hence left subject to\nFLSA wage and hour rules) individuals employed by\nthird-party employers whom the Act had covered prior to\n1974. 39 Fed. Reg. 35385 (companionship workers \u201cnot\nexempt\u201d if employed by a third party that already was a\n\u201ccovered enterprise\u201d under the FLSA). The clear implica\ntion of the proposed rule was that companionship workers\nemployed by third-party enterprises that were not covered\nby the FLSA prior to the 1974 Amendments (e.g., most\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsmaller private agencies) would be included within the\n\u00a7213(a)(15) exemption.\n  Since the proposed rule was simply a proposal, its pres\nence meant that the Department was considering the\nmatter; after that consideration the Department might\nchoose to adopt the proposal or to withdraw it. As it\nturned out, the Department did withdraw the proposal for\nspecial treatment of employees of \u201ccovered enterprises.\u201d\nThe result was a determination that exempted all third-\nparty-employed companionship workers from the Act. We\ndo not understand why such a possibility was not rea\nsonably foreseeable. See, e.g., Arizona Public Serv. Co. v.\nEPA, 211 F. 3d 1280, 1299\u20131300 (CADC 2000) (notice\nsufficient where agency first proposed that Indian tribes\nbe required to meet the \u201csame requirements\u201d as States\nwith respect to judicial review of Clean Air Act permitting\nactions, but then adopted a final rule that exempted tribes\nfrom certain, though not all, requirements), cert. denied\nsub nom. Michigan v. EPA, 532 U. S. 970 (2001).\n  Neither can we find any significant legal problem with\nthe Department\u2019s explanation for the change. The agency\nsaid that it had \u201cconcluded that these exemptions can be\navailable to such third party employers\u201d because that\ninterpretation is \u201cmore consistent\u201d with statutory language\nthat refers to \u201c \u2018any employee\u2019 engaged \u2018in\u2019 the enumerated\nservices\u201d and with \u201cprior practices concerning other simi\nlarly worded exemptions.\u201d 40 Fed. Reg. 7405. There is no\nindication that anyone objected to this explanation at the\ntime. And more than 30 years later it remains a reason\nable, albeit brief, explanation. See Global Crossing Tele\ncommunications, Inc. v. Metrophones Telecommunications,\nInc., 550 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 18).\n  Respondent\u2019s only contrary argument apparently con\nsists of her claim that the explanation does not take\nproper account of the statute\u2019s reference to \u201cdomestic\nservice employees,\u201d which term (given the Social Security\n16      LONG ISLAND CARE AT HOME, LTD. v. COKE\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute and legislative history) must refer only to those\nwho are paid by the household for whom they provide\nservices. If so, she simply repeats in different form argu\nments that we have already considered and rejected. See\nPart II\u2013A, supra.\n                             III\n  For these reasons the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment is\nreversed, and we remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n",

The question before us is whether, in light of the statute's text and history, and a different (apparently conflicting) regulation, the Department's regulation is valid and binding. See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843-844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In 1974, Congress amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA or Act), 52 Stat. 1060, to include many \"domestic service\" employees not previously subject to its minimum wage and maximum hour requirements. See Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 (1974 Amendments), \u00a7\u00a7 7(b)(1), (2), 88 Stat. 62 (adding 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(f), which provides for a minimum wage for domestic service employees, and \u00a7 207(<i>l</i>), which extends overtime restrictions to domestic service employees). When doing so, Congress simultaneously created an exemption that <i>excluded</i> from FLSA coverage certain subsets of employees \"employed in domestic service employment,\" including babysitters \"employed on a casual basis\" and the companionship workers described above. \u00a7 7(b)(3), 88 Stat. 62, (codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(15)).</p>\n<p>The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) then promulgated a set of regulations that included two regulations at issue here. The first, set forth in a subpart of the proposed regulations entitled \"General Regulations,\" defines the statutory term \"domestic service employment\" as</p>\n<blockquote>\"services of a household nature performed by an employee in or about a private home ... <i>of the person by whom he or she is employed</i> ... such as cooks, waiters, butlers, valets, maids, housekeepers, governesses, nurses, janitors, laundresses, caretakers, handymen, gardeners, footmen, grooms, and chauffeurs of automobiles for family use [as well as] babysitters employed on other than a casual basis.\" 40 Fed.Reg. 7405 (1975) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2345</span> (emphasis added) (codified at 29 CFR \u00a7 552.3).</blockquote>\n<p>The second, set forth in a later subsection entitled \"Interpretations,\" says that exempt companionship workers include those</p>\n<blockquote>\"who are employed by an employer or agency other than the family or household using their services ... [whether or not] such an employee [is assigned] to more than one household or family in the same workweek ... .\" 40 Fed.Reg. 7407 (codified at 29 CFR \u00a7 552.109(a)).</blockquote>\n<p>This latter regulation (which we shall call the \"third-party regulation\") has proved controversial in recent years. On at least three separate occasions during the past 15 years, the Department considered changing the regulation and narrowing the exemption in order to bring within the scope of the FLSA's wage and hour coverage companionship workers paid by third parties (other than family members of persons receiving the services, who under the proposals were to remain exempt). 58 Fed.Reg. 69310-69312 (1993); 60 Fed. Reg. 46798 (1995); 66 Fed.Reg. 5481, 5485 (2001). But the Department ultimately decided not to make any change. 67 Fed. Reg. 16668 (2002).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In April 2002, Evelyn Coke (respondent), a domestic worker who provides \"companionship services\" to elderly and infirm men and women, brought this lawsuit against her former employer, Long Island Care at Home, Ltd., and its owner, Maryann Osborne (petitioners). App. 1, 19; 267 F.Supp.2d 332, 333-334 (E.D.N.Y. 2003). She alleged that the petitioners failed to pay her the minimum wages and overtime wages to which she was entitled under the FLSA and a New York statute, and she sought a judgment for those unpaid wages. App. 21-22. All parties assume for present purposes that the FLSA entitles Coke to the payments if, but only if, the statutory exemption for \"companionship services\" does not apply to companionship workers paid by third-party agencies such as Long Island Care. The District Court found the Department's third-party regulation valid and controlling, and it consequently dismissed Coke's lawsuit. 267 F.Supp.2d, at 341.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Second Circuit found the Department's third-party regulation \"unenforceable\" and set aside the District Court's judgment. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786994\"><a href=\"/opinion/786994/evelyn-coke-v-long-island-care-at-home-ltd-and-mar/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 133, 135 (2004). Long Island Care and Osborne sought certiorari. At the Solicitor General's suggestion, we vacated the Second Circuit's decision and remanded the case so that the Circuit could consider a recent DOL \"Advisory Memorandum\" explaining (and defending) the regulation. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1147</span></span>, 126 S.Ct. 1189, 163 L.Ed.2d 1125 (2006); App. E to Pet. for Cert. 50a (Wage and Hour Advisory Memorandum No.2005-1 (Dec. 1, 2005) (hereinafter Advisory Memorandum)). The memorandum failed to convince the Second Circuit, which again held the regulation unenforceable. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795596\"><a href=\"/opinion/795596/evelyn-coke-v-long-island-care-at-home-ltd-and-mar/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 50-52 (2006) <i>(per curiam).</i> Long Island Care and Osborne again sought certiorari. And this time, we granted their petition and set the case for argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We have previously pointed out that the \"`power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created... program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.'\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S., at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (quoting <i>Morton v. Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108969\"><a href=\"/opinion/108969/morton-v-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span>, 231, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974); omission in original). When an agency fills such a \"gap\" reasonably, and in accordance with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2346</span> other applicable (<i>e.g.,</i> procedural) requirements, the courts accept the result as legally binding. 467 U.S., at 843-844, 104 S.Ct. 2778; <i>United States v. Mead Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 227, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001).</p>\n<p>In this case, the FLSA explicitly leaves gaps, for example as to the scope and definition of statutory terms such as \"domestic service employment\" and \"companionship services.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(15). It provides the Department of Labor with the power to fill these gaps through rules and regulations. <i>Ibid.;</i> 1974 Amendments, \u00a7 29(b), 88 Stat. 76 (authorizing the Secretary of Labor \"to prescribe necessary rules, regulations, and orders with regard to the amendments made by this Act\"). The subject matter of the regulation in question concerns a matter in respect to which the agency is expert, and it concerns an interstitial matter, <i>i.e.,</i> a portion of a broader definition, the details of which, as we said, Congress entrusted the agency to work out.</p>\n<p>The Department focused fully upon the matter in question. It gave notice, it proposed regulations, it received public comment, and it issued final regulations in light of that comment. 39 Fed.Reg. 35383 (1974); 40 Fed.Reg. 7404. See <i>Mead, supra,</i> at 230, 121 S.Ct. 2164. The resulting regulation says that employees who provide \"companionship services\" fall within the terms of the statutory exemption irrespective of who pays them. Since on its face the regulation seems to fill a statutory gap, one might ask what precisely is it about the regulation that might make it unreasonable or otherwise unlawful?</p>\n<p>Respondent argues, and the Second Circuit concluded, that a thorough examination of the regulation's content, its method of promulgation, and its context reveals serious legal problems\u0097problems that led the Second Circuit to conclude that the regulation was unenforceable. In particular, respondent claims that the regulation falls outside the scope of Congress' delegation; that it is inconsistent with another, legally governing regulation; that it is an \"interpretive\" regulation not warranting judicial deference; and that it was improperly promulgated. We shall examine each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Respondent refers to the statute's language exempting from FLSA coverage those \"employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for individuals who (because of age or infirmity) are unable to care for themselves.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(15). She claims that the words \"domestic service employment\" limit the provision's scope to those workers employed by persons who themselves receive the services (or are part of that person's household) and exclude those who are employed by \"third parties.\" And she advances several arguments in favor of this position.</p>\n<p>Respondent points to the overall purpose of the 1974 Amendments, namely to <i>extend</i> FLSA coverage, see, <i>e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 93-232, pp. 2, 8 (1973); she notes that prior to the amendments the FLSA already covered companionship workers employed by certain third parties (<i>e.g.,</i> private agencies that were large enough, in terms of annual sales, to qualify for the FLSA's \"enterprise coverage\" provisions, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206(a), 207(a)(1) (1970 ed.), see \u00a7\u00a7 203(r), (s)(1) (defining \"enterprise\" and \"enterprise engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce\")); and she concludes that Congress must therefore have meant its \"domestic service employment\" language in the exemption to apply only to persons not employed by third parties such as Long Island Care. Respondent tries to bolster this argument <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2347</span> by pointing to statements made by some Members of Congress during floor debates over the 1974 Amendments. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 119 Cong. Rec. 24801 (1973) (statement of Sen. Burdick) (\"I am not concerned about the professional domestic who does this as a daily living,\" but rather about \"people who might have an aged father, an aged mother, an infirm father, an infirm mother, and a neighbor comes in and sits with them\"). And she also points to a different statute, the Social Security statute, which defines \"domestic service employment\" as domestic work performed in \"a private home <i>of the employer.</i>\" 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3510(c)(1) (2000 ed.) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>We do not find these arguments convincing. The statutory language refers broadly to \"domestic service employment\" and to \"companionship services.\" It expressly instructs the agency to work out the details of those broad definitions. And whether to include workers paid by third parties within the scope of the definitions is one of those details.</p>\n<p>Although the FLSA in 1974 already covered <i>some</i> of the third-party-paid workers, it did not at that point cover others. It did not cover, for example, companionship workers employed directly by the aged person's family; nor did it cover workers employed by many smaller private agencies. The result is that whether, or how, the definition should apply to workers paid by third parties raises a set of complex questions. Should the FLSA cover <i>all</i> companionship workers paid by third parties? Or should the FLSA cover <i>some</i> such companionship workers, perhaps those working for some (say, large but not small) private agencies, or those hired by a son or daughter to help an aged or infirm mother living in a distant city? Should it cover <i>none</i>? How should one weigh the need for a simple, uniform application of the exemption against the fact that some (but not all) third-party employees were previously covered? Satisfactory answers to such questions may well turn upon the kind of thorough knowledge of the subject matter and ability to consult at length with affected parties that an agency, such as the Department of Labor, possesses. And it is consequently reasonable to infer (and we do infer) that Congress intended its broad grant of definitional authority to the Department to include the authority to answer these kinds of questions.</p>\n<p>Because respondent refers to the Social Security statute and the legislative history, we add that unlike the text of the Social Security statute, the text of the FLSA does not expressly answer the third-party-employment question. Compare 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3510(c)(1) with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(15). Nor can one find any clear answer in the statute's legislative history. Compare 119 Cong. Rec. 24801 (statement of Sen. Burdick, quoted above), with, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 24798 (statement of Sen. Johnston) (expressing concern that requiring payment of minimum wage to companionship workers might make such services so expensive that some people would be forced to leave the work force in order to take care of aged or infirm parents).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondent says that the third-party regulation conflicts with the Department's \"General Regulation\" that defines the statutory term \"domestic service employment.\" Title 29 CFR \u00a7 552.3 says that the term covers services \"of a household nature performed by ... employee[s]\" ranging from \"maids\" to \"cooks\" to \"housekeepers\" to \"caretakers\" and others, \"in or about a private home ... <i>of the person by whom he or she is employed</i>\" (emphasis added). See also \u00a7 552.101(a). A companionship worker employed by a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2348</span> third party to work at the home of an aged or infirm man or woman is not working at the \"home ... of the person by whom he or she is employed\" (<i>i.e.,</i> she is not working at the home of the third-party employer). Hence, the two regulations are inconsistent, for the one limits the definition of \"domestic service employee\" for purposes of the 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(15) exemption to workers employed by the household, but the other includes in the subclass of exempt companionship workers persons who are <i>not</i> employed by the household. Respondent adds that, given the conflict, the former \"General Regulation\" must govern (primarily because, in her view, only the former regulation is entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference, an issue we address in Part II-C, <i>infra</i>).</p>\n<p>Respondent is correct when she says that the literal language of the two regulations conflicts as to whether workers paid by third parties are included within the statutory exemption. The question remains, however, which regulation governs in light of this conflict. The Department, in its Advisory Memorandum, suggests that the third-party regulation governs, and we agree, for several reasons.</p>\n<p>First, if we were to decide the contrary, <i>i.e.,</i> that the text of the General Regulation, 29 CFR \u00a7 552.3, controls on the issue of third-party employment, our interpretation would create serious problems. Although \u00a7 552.3 states that it is supplying a definition of \"domestic service employment\" only \"[a]s [that term is] used\" in the statutory exemption, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(15), the rule appears in other ways to have been meant to supply a definition of \"domestic service employment\" for the FLSA as a whole (a prospect the Department endorses in its Advisory Memorandum). Why else would the Department have included the extensive list of qualifying professions, virtually none of which have anything to do with the subjects of \u00a7 213(a)(15), babysitting and companionship services? But if we were to apply \u00a7 552.3's literal definition of \"domestic service employment\" (including the \"home ... of the [employer]\" language) across the FLSA, that would place outside the scope of FLSA's wage and hour rules any butlers, chauffeurs, and so forth who are employed by <i>any</i> third party. That result seems clearly contrary to Congress' intent in enacting the 1974 Amendments, particularly if it would withdraw from FLSA coverage all domestic service employees previously covered by the \"enterprise coverage\" provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, \u00a7 552.3's definition of \"domestic service employment\" were limited to the statute's exemption provision, applying this definition literally (by removing all third-party employees from the exemption) would extend the Act's coverage not simply to third-party-employed companionship workers paid by large institutions, but also to those paid directly by a family member of an elderly or infirm person receiving such services whenever the family member lived in a different household than the invalid. Nothing in the statute suggests that Congress intended to make the exemption contingent on whether a family member chose to reside in the same household as the invalid, and it is a result that respondent herself seems to wish to avoid. See Brief for Respondent 34, n. 31.</p>\n<p>Second, normally the specific governs the general. <i>E.g., </i><i>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 384-385, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992); <i>Simpson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109806\"><a href=\"/opinion/109806/simpson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 15, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978). The <i>sole purpose</i> of the third-party regulation, \u00a7 552.109(a), is to explain how the companionship services exemption applies to persons employed by third-party entities, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2349</span> whereas the primary (if not sole) purpose of the conflicting general definitional regulation, \u00a7 552.3, is to describe the <i>kind of work</i> that must be performed by someone to qualify as a \"domestic service\" employee. Given that context, \u00a7 552.109(a) is the more specific regulation with respect to the third-party-employment question.</p>\n<p>Third, we concede that the Department may have interpreted these regulations differently at different times in their history. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 58 Fed.Reg. 69311 (employees of a third-party employer qualify for the exemption only if they are also jointly employed \"by the family or household using their services\"); D. Sweeney, DOL Opinion Letter, Home Health Aides/Companionship Exemption, 6A LRR, Wages and Hours Manual 99:8205 (Jan. 6, 1999) (similar). But as long as interpretive changes create no unfair surprise\u0097and the Department's recourse to notice-and-comment rulemaking in an attempt to codify its new interpretation, see 58 Fed.Reg. 69311, makes any such surprise unlikely here\u0097the change in interpretation alone presents no separate ground for disregarding the Department's present interpretation. Cf. <i>Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112163\"><a href=\"/opinion/112163/bowen-v-georgetown-univ-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span>, 212, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988).</p>\n<p>Fourth, we must also concede, as respondent points out, that the Department set forth its most recent interpretation of these regulations in an \"Advisory Memorandum\" issued only to internal Department personnel and which the Department appears to have written in response to this litigation. We have \"no reason,\" however, \"to suspect that [this] interpretation\" is merely a \"`<i>post hoc</i> rationalizatio[n]'\" of past agency action, or that it \"does not reflect the agency's fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\" <i>Auer v. Robbins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118089\"><a href=\"/opinion/118089/auer-v-robbins/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 462, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997) (quoting <i>Bowen, supra</i>). Where, as here, an agency's course of action indicates that the interpretation of its own regulation reflects its considered views\u0097the Department has clearly struggled with the third-party-employment question since at least 1993\u0097we have accepted that interpretation as the agency's own, even if the agency set those views forth in a legal brief. See 519 U.S., at 462, 117 S.Ct. 905.</p>\n<p>For all these reasons, we conclude that the Department's interpretation of the two regulations falls well within the principle that an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is \"controlling\" unless \"`\"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with\"'\" the regulations being interpreted. <i>Id.,</i> at 461, 117 S.Ct. 905 (quoting <i>Robertson v.

Her reason is a special one. She says that the regulation is an \"interpretive\" regulation, a kind of regulation that may be used, not to fill a statutory \"gap,\" but simply to describe an agency's view of what a statute means. That kind of regulation may \"persuade\" a reviewing court, <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944), but will not necessarily \"bind\" a reviewing court. Cf. <i>Mead,</i> 533 U.S., at 232, 121 S.Ct. 2164 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2350</span> (\"interpretive rules ... enjoy no <i>Chevron</i> status <i>as a class</i>\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>Like respondent, the Court of Appeals concluded that the third-party regulation did not fill a statutory gap and hence was not legally binding. 376 F.3d, at 131-133, 462 F.3d, at 50-51. It based its conclusion upon three considerations: First, when the Department promulgated a series of regulations to implement the \u00a7 213(a)(15) exemptions, 29 CFR pt. 552, it placed the third-party regulation in Subpart B, entitled \"Interpretations,\" not in Subpart A, entitled \"General Regulations.\" Second, the Department said that regulations 552.3, .4, .5, and .6, all in Subpart A, contained the \"definitions\" that the statute \"require[s].\" Third, the Department initially said in 1974 that Subpart A would \"defin[e] and delimi[t] ... the ter[m] `domestic service employee,'\" while Subpart B would \"se[t] forth ... a statement of general policy and interpretation concerning the application of the [FLSA] to domestic service employees.\" 376 F.3d, at 131-132, 462 F.3d, at 50-51 (quoting 39 Fed.Reg. 35382).</p>\n<p>These reasons do not convince us that the Department intended its third-party regulation to carry no special legal weight. For one thing, other considerations strongly suggest the contrary, namely that the Department intended the third-party regulation as a binding application of its rulemaking authority. The regulation directly governs the conduct of members of the public, \"`affecting individual rights and obligations.'\" <i>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110062\"><a href=\"/opinion/110062/chrysler-corp-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 302, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979) (quoting <i>Morton,</i> 415 U.S., at 232, 94 S.Ct. 1055). When promulgating the rule, the agency used full public notice-and-comment procedures, which under the Administrative Procedure Act an agency need not use when producing an \"interpretive\" rule. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3)(A) (exempting \"interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice\" from notice-and-comment procedures). Each time the Department has considered amending the rule, it has similarly used full notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. 58 Fed.Reg. 69310 (1993); 60 Fed. Reg. 46797 (1995); 66 Fed.Reg. 5485 (2001). And for the past 30 years, according to the Department's Advisory Memorandum (and not disputed by respondent), the Department has treated the third-party regulation like the others, <i>i.e.,</i> as a legally binding exercise of its rulemaking authority. App. E to Pet. for Cert. 63a-64a.</p>\n<p>For another thing, the Subpart B heading \"Interpretations\" (and the other indicia upon which the Court of Appeals relied) could well refer to the fact that Subpart B contains matters of detail, interpreting and applying the more general definitions of Subpart A. Indeed, Subpart B's other regulations\u0097involving such matters as employer \"credit[s]\" against minimum wage payments for provision of \"food,\" \"lodging,\" and \"drycleaning,\" 29 CFR \u00a7 552.100(b), and so forth\u0097strongly indicate that such details, not a direct interpretation of the statute's language, are at issue.</p>\n<p>Finally, the ultimate question is whether <i>Congress</i> would have intended, and expected, courts to treat an agency's rule, regulation, application of a statute, or other agency action as within, or outside, its delegation to the agency of \"gap-filling\" authority. Where an agency rule sets forth important individual rights and duties, where the agency focuses fully and directly upon the issue, where the agency uses full notice-and-comment procedures to promulgate a rule, where the resulting rule falls within the statutory grant of authority, and where the rule itself is reasonable, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2351</span> then a court ordinarily assumes that Congress intended it to defer to the agency's determination. See <i>Mead, supra,</i> at 229-233, 121 S.Ct. 2164.</p>\n<p>The three contrary considerations to which the Court of Appeals points are insufficient, in our view, to overcome the other factors we have mentioned, all of which suggest that courts should defer to the Department's rule. And that, in our view, is what the law requires.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>Respondent's final claim is that the 1974 agency notice-and-comment procedure, leading to the promulgation of the third-party regulation, was legally \"defective\" because notice was inadequate and the Department's explanation also inadequate. We do not agree.</p>\n<p>The Administrative Procedure Act requires an agency conducting notice-and-comment rulemaking to publish in its notice of proposed rulemaking \"either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3). The Courts of Appeals have generally interpreted this to mean that the final rule the agency adopts must be \"a `logical outgrowth' of the rule proposed.\" <i>National Black Media Coalition v. FCC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"470966\"><a href=\"/opinion/470966/national-black-media-coalition-and-the-new-york-af/\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></a></span>, 1022 (C.A.2 1986).

The object, in short, is one of fair notice.</p>\n<p>Initially the Department proposed a rule of the kind that respondent seeks, namely a rule that would have placed outside the exemption (and hence left subject to FLSA wage and hour rules) individuals employed by third-party employers whom the Act had covered prior to 1974. 39 Fed.Reg. 35385 (companionship workers \"not exempt\" if employed by a third party that already was a \"covered enterprise\" under the FLSA). The clear implication of the proposed rule was that companionship workers employed by third-party enterprises that <i>were not</i> covered by the FLSA prior to the 1974 Amendments (<i>e.g.,</i> most smaller private agencies) <i>would</i> be included within the \u00a7 213(a)(15) exemption.</p>\n<p>Since the proposed rule was simply a proposal, its presence meant that the Department was <i>considering</i> the matter; after that consideration the Department might choose to adopt the proposal or to withdraw it. As it turned out, the Department did withdraw the proposal for special treatment of employees of \"covered enterprises.\" The result was a determination that exempted <i>all</i> third-party-employed companionship workers from the Act. We do not understand why such a possibility was not reasonably foreseeable. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Arizona Public Serv. Co. v. EPA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185156\"><a href=\"/opinion/185156/az-pub-svc-co-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span>, 1299-1300 (C.A.D.C.2000) (notice sufficient where agency first proposed that Indian tribes be required to meet the \"same requirements\" as States with respect to judicial review of Clean Air Act permitting actions, but then adopted a final rule that exempted tribes from certain, though not all, requirements), cert. denied <i>sub nom. </i><i>Michigan v. EPA,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></span>, 121 S.Ct. 1600, 149 L.Ed.2d 467 (2001).</p>\n<p>Neither can we find any significant legal problem with the Department's explanation for the change. The agency said that it had \"concluded that these exemptions can be available to such third party employers\" because that interpretation is \"more consistent\" with statutory language that refers to \"`any employee' engaged `in' the enumerated services\" and with \"prior practices concerning other similarly worded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2352</span> exemptions.\" 40 Fed.Reg. 7405. There is no indication that anyone objected to this explanation at the time. And more than 30 years later it remains a reasonable, albeit brief, explanation. See <i>Global Crossing Telecommunications, Inc. v. Metrophones Telecommunications, Inc.,</i> 550 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1513, 1525, 167 L.Ed.2d 422 (2007).</p>\n<p>Respondent's only contrary argument apparently consists of her claim that the explanation does not take proper account of the statute's reference to \"domestic service employees,\" which term (given the Social Security statute and legislative history) must refer only to those who are paid by the household for whom they provide services. If so, she simply repeats in different form arguments that we have already considered and rejected. See Part II-A, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>For these reasons the Court of Appeals' judgment is reversed, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n</div>",
