In this case, we must <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2334</span> decide a question left open in <i>Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc.,</i> 543 U.S. 157, 161, 125 S.Ct. 577, 160 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004): whether \u00a7 107(a) provides so-called potentially responsible parties (PRPs), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9607(a)(1)-(4), with a cause of action to recover costs from other PRPs. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Courts have frequently grappled with whether and how PRPs may recoup CERCLA-related costs from other PRPs. The questions lie at the intersection of two statutory provisions\u0097CERCLA \u00a7\u00a7 107(a) and 113(f). Section 107(a) defines four categories of PRPs, 94 Stat. 2781, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9607(a)(1)-(4), and makes them liable for, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(A) all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State or an Indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan.\" \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(A)-(B).</blockquote>\n<p>Enacted as part of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), 100 Stat. 1613, \u00a7 113(f) authorizes one PRP to sue another for contribution in certain circumstances. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Prior to the advent of \u00a7 113(f)'s express contribution right, some courts held that \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) provided a cause of action for a private party to recover voluntarily incurred response costs and to seek contribution after having been sued. See <i>Cooper Industries, supra,</i> at 161-162, 125 S.Ct. 577 (collecting cases); <i>Key Tronic Corp. v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 809, 816, n. 7, 114 S.Ct. 1960, 128 L.Ed.2d 797 (1994) same. After SARA's enactment, however, some Courts of Appeals believed it necessary to \"direc[t] traffic between\" \u00a7 107(a) and \u00a7 113(f). 459 F.3d 827, 832 (C.A.8 2006) (case below). As a result, many Courts of Appeals held that \u00a7 113(f) was the exclusive remedy for PRPs. See <i>Cooper Industries, supra,</i> at 169, 125 S.Ct. 577 (collecting cases). But as courts prevented PRPs from suing under \u00a7 107(a), they expanded \u00a7 113(f) to allow PRPs to seek \"contribution\" even in the absence of a suit under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). <i>Aviall Servs., Inc. v. Cooper Industries, Inc.,</i> 312 F.3d 677, 681 (C.A.5 2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p>In <i>Cooper Industries,</i> we held that a private party could seek contribution from other liable parties only after having been sued under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). 543 U.S., at 161, 125 S.Ct. 577. This narrower interpretation of \u00a7 113(f) caused several Courts of Appeals to reconsider whether PRPs have rights under \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B), an issue we declined to address in <i>Cooper Industries. Id.,</i> at 168, 125 S.Ct. 577. After revisiting the issue, some courts have permitted \u00a7 107(a) actions by PRPs. See <i>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. UGI Utilities, Inc.,</i> 423 F.3d 90 (C.A.2 2005); <i>Metropolitan Water Reclamation Dist. of Greater Chicago v. North American Galvanizing &amp; Coatings, Inc.,</i> 473 F.3d 824 (C.A.7 2007). However, at least one court continues to hold that \u00a7 113(f) provides the exclusive cause of action available to PRPs. <i>E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. United States,</i> 460 F.3d 515 (C.A.3 2006). Today, we resolve this issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2335</span> B</h2>\n<p>In this case, respondent Atlantic Research leased property at the Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot, a facility operated by the Department of Defense. At the site, Atlantic Research retrofitted rocket motors for petitioner United States. Using a high-pressure water spray, Atlantic Research removed pieces of propellant from the motors. It then burned the propellant pieces. Some of the resultant wastewater and burned fuel contaminated soil and groundwater at the site.</p>\n<p>Atlantic Research cleaned the site at its own expense and then sought to recover some of its costs by suing the United States under both \u00a7 107(a) and \u00a7 113(f). After our decision in <i>Cooper Industries</i> foreclosed relief under \u00a7 113(f), Atlantic Research amended its complaint to seek relief under \u00a7 107(a) and federal common law. The United States moved to dismiss, arguing that \u00a7 107(a) does not allow PRPs (such as Atlantic Research) to recover costs. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss, relying on a case decided prior to our decision in <i>Cooper Industries, Dico, Inc. v. Amoco Oil Co.,</i> 340 F.3d 525 (C.A.8 2003).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed. Recognizing that <i>Cooper Industries</i> undermined the reasoning of its prior precedent, 459 F.3d, at 830, n. 4, the Court of Appeals joined the Second and Seventh Circuits in holding that \u00a7 113(f) does not provide \"the exclusive route by which [PRPs] may recover cleanup costs.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 834 (citing <i>Consolidated Edison Co., supra</i>). The court reasoned that \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) authorized suit by any person other than the persons permitted to sue under \u00a7 107(a)(4)(A). 459 F.3d, at 835. Accordingly, it held that \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) provides a cause of action to Atlantic Research. To prevent perceived conflict between \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) and \u00a7 113(f)(1), the Court of Appeals reasoned that PRPs that \"have been subject to \u00a7\u00a7 106 or 107 enforcement actions are still required to use \u00a7 113, thereby ensuring its continued vitality.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 836-837. We granted certiorari, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1144, 166 L.Ed.2d 910 (2007), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The parties' dispute centers on what \"other person[s]\" may sue under \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B). The Government argues that \"any other person\" refers to any person not identified as a PRP in \u00a7\u00a7 107(a)(1)-(4).<sup>[2]</sup> In other words, subparagraph (B) permits suit only by non-PRPs and thus bars Atlantic Research's claim. Atlantic Research counters that subparagraph (B) takes its cue from subparagraph <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2336</span> (A), not the earlier paragraph (1)-(4). In accord with the Court of Appeals, Atlantic Research believes that subparagraph (B) provides a cause of action to anyone except the United States, a State, or an Indian tribe\u0097the persons listed in subparagraph (A). We agree with Atlantic Research.</p>\n<p>Statutes must \"be read as a whole.\" <i>King v. St. Vincent's Hospital,</i> 502 U.S. 215, 221, 112 S.Ct. 570, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991). Applying that maxim, the language of subparagraph (B) can be understood only with reference to subparagraph (A). The provisions are adjacent and have remarkably similar structures. Each concerns certain costs that have been incurred by certain entities and that bear a specified relationship to the national contingency plan.<sup>[3]</sup> Bolstering the structural link, the text also denotes a relationship between the two provisions. By using the phrase \"other necessary costs,\" subparagraph (B) refers to and differentiates the relevant costs from those listed in subparagraph (A).</p>\n<p>In light of the relationship between the subparagraph, it is natural to read the phrase \"any other person\" by referring to the immediately preceding subparagraph (A), which permits suit only by the United States, a State, or an Indian tribe. The phrase \"any other person\" therefore means any person other than those three. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(21) (defining \"person\" to include the United States and the various States). Consequently, the plain language of subparagraph (B) authorizes cost-recovery actions by any private party, including PRPs. See <i>Key Tronic,</i> 511 U.S., at 818, 114 S.Ct. 1960 (stating in dictum that \u00a7 107 \"impliedly authorizes private parties to recover cleanup costs from <i>other</i> PRP[s]\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>The Government's interpretation makes little textual sense. In subparagraph (B), the phrase \"any other necessary costs\" and the phrase \"any other person\" both refer to antecedents\u0097\"costs\" and \"person[s]\"\u0097located in some previous statutory provision. Although \"any other necessary costs\" clearly references the costs in subparagraph (A), the Government would inexplicably interpret \"any other person\" to refer not to the persons listed in subparagraph (A) but to the persons listed as PRPs in paragraphs (1)-(4). Nothing in the text of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) suggests an intent to refer to antecedents located in two different statutory provisions. Reading the statute in the manner suggested by the Government would destroy the symmetry of \u00a7\u00a7 107(a)(4)(A) and (B) and render subparagraph (B) internally confusing.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the statute defines PRPs so broadly as to sweep in virtually all persons likely to incur cleanup costs. Hence, if PRPs do not qualify as \"any other person\" for purposes of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B), it is unclear what private party would. The Government posits that \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) authorizes relief for \"innocent\" private parties\u0097for instance, a landowner whose land has been contaminated by another. But even parties not responsible for contamination may fall within the broad definitions of PRPs in \u00a7\u00a7 107(a)(1)-(4). See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(1) (listing \"the owner and operator of a ... facility\" as a PRP); see also <i>United States v. Alcan Aluminum Corp.,</i> 315 F.3d 179, 184 (C.A.2 2003) (\"CERCLA \u00a7 9607 is a strict liability statute\"). The Government's reading of the text logically precludes all PRPs, innocent or not, from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2337</span> recovering cleanup costs. Accordingly, accepting the Government's interpretation would reduce the number of potential plaintiffs to almost zero, rendering \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) a dead letter.<sup>[4]</sup> See <i>Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley,</i> 219 U.S. 467, 475, 31 S.Ct. 265, 55 L.Ed. 297 (1911) (\"We must have regard to all the words used by Congress, and as far as possible give effect to them\").</p>\n<p>According to the Government, our interpretation suffers from the same infirmity because it causes the phrase \"any other person\" to duplicate work done by other text. In the Government's view, the phrase \"any other necessary costs\" \"already precludes governmental entities from recovering under\" \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B). Brief for United States 20. Even assuming the Government is correct, it does not alter our conclusion. The phrase \"any other person\" performs a significant function simply by clarifying that subparagraph (B) excludes the persons enumerated in subparagraph (A). In any event, our hesitancy to construe statutes to render language superfluous does not require us to avoid surplusage at all costs. It is appropriate to tolerate a degree of surplusage rather than adopt a textually dubious construction that threatens to render the entire provision a nullity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Government also argues that our interpretation will create friction between \u00a7 107(a) and \u00a7 113(f), the very harm courts of appeals have previously tried to avoid. In particular, the Government maintains that our interpretation, by offering PRPs a choice between \u00a7 107(a) and \u00a7 113(f), effectively allows PRPs to circumvent \u00a7 113(f)'s shorter statute of limitations. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9613(g)(2)-(3). Furthermore, the Government argues, PRPs will eschew equitable apportionment under \u00a7 113(f) in favor of joint and several liability under \u00a7 107(a). Finally, the Government contends that our interpretation eviscerates the settlement bar set forth in \u00a7 113(f)(2).</p>\n<p>We have previously recognized that \u00a7\u00a7 107(a) and 113(f) provide two \"clearly distinct\" remedies. <i>Cooper Industries,</i> 543 U.S., at 163, n. 3, 125 S.Ct. 577. \"CERCLA provide[s] for a <i>right to cost recovery</i> in certain circumstances, \u00a7 107(a), and <i>separate rights to contribution</i> in other circumstances, \u00a7\u00a7 113(f)(1), 113(f)(3)(B).\" <i>Id.,</i> at 163, 125 S.Ct. 577 (emphases added). The Government, however, uses the word \"contribution\" as if it were synonymous with any apportionment of expenses among PRPs. Brief for United States 33, n. 14 (\"Contribution is merely a form of cost recovery, not a wholly independent type of relief\"); see also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Pinal Creek Group v. Newmont Mining Corp.,</i> 118 F.3d 1298, 1301 (C.A.9 1997) (\"Because all PRPs are liable under the statute, a claim by one PRP against another PRP necessarily is for contribution\"). This imprecise usage confuses the complementary yet distinct nature of the rights established in \u00a7\u00a7 107(a) and 113(f).</p>\n<p>Section 113(f) explicitly grants PRPs a right to contribution. Contribution <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2338</span> is defined as the \"tortfeasor's right to collect from others responsible for the same tort after the tortfeasor has paid more than his or her proportionate share, the shares being determined as a percentage of fault.\" Black's Law Dictionary 353 (8th ed.1999). Nothing in \u00a7 113(f) suggests that Congress used the term \"contribution\" in anything other than this traditional sense. The statute authorizes a PRP to seek contribution \"during or following\" a suit under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1).<sup>[5]</sup> Thus, \u00a7 113(f)(1) permits suit before or after the establishment of common liability. In either case, a PRP's right to contribution under \u00a7 113(f)(1) is contingent upon an inequitable distribution of common liability among liable parties.</p>\n<p>By contrast, \u00a7 107(a) permits recovery of cleanup costs but does not create a right to contribution. A private party may recover under \u00a7 107(a) without any establishment of liability to a third party. Moreover, \u00a7 107(a) permits a PRP to recover only the costs it has \"incurred\" in cleaning up a site. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(B). When a party pays to satisfy a settlement agreement or a court judgment, it does not incur its own costs of response. Rather, it reimburses other parties for costs that those parties incurred.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the remedies available in \u00a7\u00a7 107(a) and 113(f) complement each other by providing causes of action \"to persons in different procedural circumstances.\" <i>Consolidated Edison,</i> 423 F.3d, at 99; see also <i>E.I. DuPont de Nemours,</i> 460 F.3d, at 548 (Sloviter, J., dissenting). Section 113(f)(1) authorizes a contribution action to PRPs with common liability stemming from an action instituted under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). And \u00a7 107(a) permits cost recovery (as distinct from contribution) by a private party that has itself incurred cleanup costs. Hence, a PRP that pays money to satisfy a settlement agreement or a court judgment may pursue \u00a7 113(f) contribution. But by reimbursing response costs paid by other parties, the PRP has not incurred its own costs of response and therefore cannot recover under \u00a7 107(a). As a result, though eligible to seek contribution under \u00a7 113(f)(1), the PRP cannot simultaneously seek to recover the same expenses under \u00a7 107(a). Thus, at least in the case of reimbursement, the PRP cannot choose the 6-year statute of limitations for cost-recovery actions over the shorter limitations period for \u00a7 113(f) contribution claims.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>For similar reasons, a PRP could not avoid \u00a7 113(f)'s equitable distribution of reimbursement costs among PRPs by instead <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2339</span> choosing to impose joint and several liability on another PRP in an action under \u00a7 107(a).<sup>[7]</sup> The choice of remedies simply does not exist. In any event, a defendant PRP in such a \u00a7 107(a) suit could blunt any inequitable distribution of costs by filing a \u00a7 113(f) counterclaim. 459 F.3d, at 835; see also <i>Consolidated Edison, supra,</i> at 100, n. 9 (collecting cases). Resolution of a \u00a7 113(f) counter-claim would necessitate the equitable apportionment of costs among the liable parties, including the PRP that filed the \u00a7 107(a) action. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(a) (\"In resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate\").</p>\n<p>Finally, permitting PRPs to seek recovery under \u00a7 107(a) will not eviscerate the settlement bar set forth in \u00a7 113(f)(2). That provision prohibits \u00a7 113(f) contribution claims against \"[a] person who has resolved its liability to the United States or a State in an administrative or judicially approved settlement ... .\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(2). The settlement bar does not by its terms protect against cost-recovery liability under \u00a7 107(a). For several reasons, we doubt this supposed loophole would discourage settlement. First, as stated above, a defendant PRP may trigger equitable apportionment by filing a \u00a7 113(f) counterclaim. A district court applying traditional rules of equity would undoubtedly consider any prior settlement as part of the liability calculus. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 886A(2), p. 337 (1977) (\"No tortfeasor can be required to make contribution beyond his own equitable share of the liability\"). Second, the settlement bar continues to provide significant protection from contribution suits by PRPs that have inequitably reimbursed the costs incurred by another party. Third, settlement carries the inherent benefit of finally resolving liability as to the United States or a State.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Because the plain terms of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) allow a PRP to recover costs from other PRPs, the statute provides Atlantic Research with a cause of action. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 113(f)(1) permits private parties to seek contribution during or following a civil action under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1). Section 113(f)(3)(B) permits private parties to seek contribution after they have settled their liability with the Government. \u00a7 9613(f)(3)(B).</p>\n<p>[2]  CERCLA \u00a7 107(a) lists four broad categories of persons as PRPs, by definition liable to other persons for various costs:\n</p>\n<p>\"(1) the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility,</p>\n<p>\"(2) any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of,</p>\n<p>\"(3) any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances, and</p>\n<p>\"(4) any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities, incineration vessels or sites selected by such person, from which there is a release, or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance, shall be liable for [various costs].\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9607(a)(1)-(4).</p>\n<p>[3]  \"The national contingency plan specifies procedures for preparing and responding to contaminations and was promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency ... .\" <i>Cooper Industries Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc.,</i> 543 U.S. 157, 161, n. 2, 125 S.Ct. 577, 160 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004) (citing 40 CFR pt. 300 (2004)).</p>\n<p>[4]  Congress amended the statute in 2002 to exempt some bona fide prospective purchasers (BFPPs) from liability under \u00a7 107(a). See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(r)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The Government claims that these persons are non-PRPs and therefore qualify as \"any other person\" under its interpretation of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B). Prior to 2002, however, the statute made this small set of persons liable as PRPs. Accordingly, even if BFPPs now give some life to the Government's interpretation of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B), it would be implausible at best to conclude that \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) lay dormant until the enactment of \u00a7 107(r)(1) in 2002.</p>\n<p>[5]  Similarly, \u00a7 113(f)(3)(B) permits a PRP to seek contribution after it \"has resolved its liability to the United States or a State ... in an administrative or judicially approved settlement....\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(3)(B).</p>\n<p>[6]  We do not suggest that \u00a7\u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) and 113(f) have no overlap at all. <i>Key Tronic Corp. v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 809, 816, 114 S.Ct. 1960, 128 L.Ed.2d 797 (1994) (stating the statutes provide \"similar and somewhat overlapping remed[ies]\"). For instance, we recognize that a PRP may sustain expenses pursuant to a consent decree following a suit under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United Technologies Corp. v. Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc.,</i> 33 F.3d 96, 97 (C.A.1 1994). In such a case, the PRP does not incur costs voluntarily but does not reimburse the costs of another party. We do not decide whether these compelled costs of response are recoverable under \u00a7 113(f), \u00a7 107(a), or both. For our purposes, it suffices to demonstrate that costs incurred voluntarily are recoverable only by way of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B), and costs of reimbursement to another person pursuant to a legal judgment or settlement are recoverable only under \u00a7 113(f). Thus, at a minimum, neither remedy swallows the other, contrary to the Government's argument.</p>\n<p>[7]  We assume without deciding that \u00a7 107(a) provides for joint and several liability.</p>\n<p>[8]  Because \u00a7 107(a) expressly permits PRPs to seek cost recovery, we need not address the alternative holding of the Court of Appeals that \u00a7 107(a) contains an additional implied right to contribution for PRPs who are not eligible for relief under \u00a7 113(f).

ATLANTIC RESEARCH CORP.\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 06\u2013562.      Argued April 23, 2007\u2014Decided June 11, 2007\nSections 107(a) and 113(f) of the Comprehensive Environmental Re\n  sponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 allow private parties\n  to recover expenses associated with cleaning up contaminated sites.\n  Section 107(a) defines four categories of potentially responsible par\n  ties (PRPs) and makes them liable for, among other things, \u201c(A) all\n  costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States\n  Government or a State or an Indian tribe not inconsistent with the\n  national contingency plan\u201d and \u201c(B) any other necessary costs of re\n  sponse incurred by any other person consistent with [such] plan,\u201d\n  \u00a7\u00a7107(a)(4)(A)\u2013(B). Originally, some courts interpreted \u00a7107(a)(4)(B)\n  as providing a cause of action for a private party to recover voluntar\n  ily incurred response costs and to seek contribution after having been\n  sued. However, after the enactment of \u00a7113(f), which authorizes one\n  PRP to sue another for contribution, many courts held it to be the ex\n  clusive remedy for PRPs. In Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Ser\n  vices, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 161, this Court held that a private party\n  could seek contribution under \u00a7113(f) only after being sued under\n  \u00a7106 or \u00a7107(a).\n     After respondent Atlantic Research cleaned up a Government site\n  it leased and contaminated while doing Government work, it sued the\n  Government to recover some of its costs under, as relevant here,\n  \u00a7107(a). The District Court dismissed the case, but the Eighth Cir\n  cuit reversed, holding that \u00a7113(f) does not provide the exclusive\n  remedy for recovering cleanup costs and that \u00a7107(a)(4)(B) provided a\n  cause of action to any person other than those permitted to sue under\n  \u00a7107(a)(4)(A).\nHeld: Because \u00a7107(a)(4)(B)\u2019s plain terms allow a PRP to recover costs\n from other PRPs, the statute provides Atlantic Research with a cause\n of action. Pp. 4\u201311.\n2          UNITED STATES v. ATLANTIC RESEARCH CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) Applying the maxim that statutes must \u201cbe read as a whole,\u201d\n    King v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221, subparagraph (B)\u2019s\n    language can be understood only with reference to subparagraph (A).\n    The provisions are adjacent and have similar structures, and the text\n    denotes a relationship between them. Subparagraph (B)\u2019s phrase\n    \u201cother necessary costs\u201d refers to and differentiates the relevant costs\n    from those listed in subparagraph (A). Thus, it is natural to read the\n    phrase \u201cany other person\u201d by referring to the immediately preceding\n    subparagraph (A). Accepting the Government\u2019s interpretation\u2014that\n    \u201cany other person\u201d refers only to a person not identified as a PRP in\n    \u00a7\u00a7107(a)(1)\u2013(4)\u2014would destroy the symmetry of subparagraphs (A)\n    and (B) and render subparagraph (B) internally confusing. Moreover,\n    because the statute defines PRPs so broadly as to sweep in virtually\n    all persons likely to incur cleanup costs, accepting that interpretation\n    would reduce the number of potential plaintiffs to almost zero, ren\n    dering subparagraph (B) a dead letter. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, this interpretation\n    will not create friction between \u00a7107(a) and \u00a7113(f). Their two clearly\n    distinct remedies complement each other: \u00a7113(f)(1) authorizes a con\n    tribution action to PRPs with common liability stemming from an ac\n    tion instituted under \u00a7106 or \u00a7107(a), while \u00a7107(a) permits cost re\n    covery (as distinct from contribution) by a private party that has\n    itself incurred cleanup costs. Thus, at least in the case of reim\n    bursement, a PRP cannot choose \u00a7107(a)\u2019s longer statute of limita\n    tions for recovery actions over \u00a7113(f)\u2019s shorter one for contribution\n    claims. Similarly, a PRP could not avoid \u00a7113(f)\u2019s equitable distribu\n    tion of reimbursement costs among PRPs by instead choosing to im\n    pose joint and several liability under \u00a7107(a). That choice of reme\n    dies simply does not exist, and in any event, a defendant PRP in a\n    \u00a7107(a) suit could blunt any such distribution by filing a \u00a7113(f) coun\n    terclaim. Finally, permitting PRPs to seek recovery under \u00a7107(a)\n    will not eviscerate \u00a7113(f)(2), which prohibits \u00a7113(f) contribution\n    claims against \u201c[a] person who has resolved its liability to the United\n    States or a State in an administrative or judicially approved settle\n    ment . . . .\u201d Although that settlement bar does not by its terms pro\n    tect against \u00a7107(a) cost-recovery liability, a district court applying\n    traditional equity rules would undoubtedly consider any prior settle\n    ment in the liability calculus; the settlement bar continues to provide\n    significant protection from contribution suits by PRPs that have in\n    equitably reimbursed costs incurred by another party; and settlement\n    carries the inherent benefit of finally resolving liability as to the\n    United States or a State.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a79607(a), 9613(f). In this case,\nwe must decide a question left open in Cooper Industries,\nInc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 161 (2004):\nwhether \u00a7107(a) provides so-called potentially responsible\nparties (PRPs), 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a79607(a)(1)\u2013(4), with a cause\nof action to recover costs from other PRPs. We hold that it\ndoes.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  Courts have frequently grappled with whether and how\nPRPs may recoup CERCLA-related costs from other PRPs.\nThe questions lie at the intersection of two statutory\nprovisions\u2014CERCLA \u00a7\u00a7107(a) and 113(f). Section 107(a)\ndefines four categories of PRPs, 94 Stat. 2781, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a79607(a)(1)\u2013(4), and makes them liable for, among other\nthings:\n2          UNITED STATES v.

S. C. \u00a79613(f).1\n   Prior to the advent of \u00a7113(f)\u2019s express contribution\nright, some courts held that \u00a7107(a)(4)(B) provided a cause\nof action for a private party to recover voluntarily incurred\nresponse costs and to seek contribution after having been\nsued. See Cooper Industries, supra, at 161\u2013162 (collecting\ncases); Key Tronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U. S. 809,\n816, n. 7 (1994) same. After SARA\u2019s enactment, however,\nsome Courts of Appeals believed it necessary to \u201cdirec[t]\ntraffic between\u201d \u00a7107(a) and \u00a7113(f). 459 F. 3d 827, 832\n(CA8 2006) (case below). As a result, many Courts of\nAppeals held that \u00a7113(f) was the exclusive remedy for\nPRPs. See Cooper Industries, supra, at 169 (collecting\ncases). But as courts prevented PRPs from suing under\n\u00a7107(a), they expanded \u00a7113(f) to allow PRPs to seek\n\u201ccontribution\u201d even in the absence of a suit under \u00a7106 or\n\u00a7107(a). Aviall Servs., Inc. v. Cooper Industries, Inc., 312\nF. 3d 677, 681 (CA5 2002) (en banc).\n   In Cooper Industries, we held that a private party could\nseek contribution from other liable parties only after\nhaving been sued under \u00a7106 or \u00a7107(a). 543 U.

S. ____ (2007)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThis narrower interpretation of \u00a7113(f) caused several\nCourts of Appeals to reconsider whether PRPs have rights\nunder \u00a7107(a)(4)(B), an issue we declined to address in\nCooper Industries. Id., at 168. After revisiting the issue,\nsome courts have permitted \u00a7107(a) actions by PRPs. See\nConsolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. UGI Utilities, Inc., 423\nF. 3d 90 (CA2 2005); Metropolitan Water Reclamation\nDist. of Greater Chicago v. North American Galvanizing &\nCoatings, Inc., 473 F. 3d 824 (CA7 2007). However, at\nleast one court continues to hold that \u00a7113(f) provides the\nexclusive cause of action available to PRPs. E. I. Dupont\nde Nemours & Co. v. United States, 460 F. 3d 515 (CA3\n2006). Today, we resolve this issue.\n                             B\n   In this case, respondent Atlantic Research leased prop\nerty at the Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot, a facility\noperated by the Department of Defense. At the site, At\nlantic Research retrofitted rocket motors for petitioner\nUnited States. Using a high-pressure water spray, Atlan\ntic Research removed pieces of propellant from the motors.\nIt then burned the propellant pieces. Some of the resul\ntant wastewater and burned fuel contaminated soil and\ngroundwater at the site.\n   Atlantic Research cleaned the site at its own expense\nand then sought to recover some of its costs by suing the\nUnited States under both \u00a7107(a) and \u00a7113(f). After our\ndecision in Cooper Industries foreclosed relief under\n\u00a7113(f), Atlantic Research amended its complaint to seek\nrelief under \u00a7107(a) and federal common law. The United\nStates moved to dismiss, arguing that \u00a7107(a) does not\nallow PRPs (such as Atlantic Research) to recover costs.\nThe District Court granted the motion to dismiss, relying\non a case decided prior to our decision in Cooper Indus\ntries, Dico, Inc. v. Amoco Oil Co., 340 F. 3d 525 (CA8\n2003).\n4        UNITED STATES v. ATLANTIC RESEARCH CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed.\nRecognizing that Cooper Industries undermined the rea\nsoning of its prior precedent, 459 F. 3d, at 830, n. 4, the\nCourt of Appeals joined the Second and Seventh Circuits\nin holding that \u00a7113(f) does not provide \u201cthe exclusive\nroute by which [PRPs] may recover cleanup costs.\u201d Id., at\n834 (citing Consolidated Edison Co., supra). The court\nreasoned that \u00a7107(a)(4)(B) authorized suit by any person\nother than the persons permitted to sue under\n\u00a7107(a)(4)(A). 459 F. 3d, at 835. Accordingly, it held that\n\u00a7107(a)(4)(B) provides a cause of action to Atlantic Re\nsearch.      To prevent perceived conflict between\n\u00a7107(a)(4)(B) and \u00a7113(f)(1), the Court of Appeals reasoned\nthat PRPs that \u201chave been subject to \u00a7\u00a7106 or 107 en\nforcement actions are still required to use \u00a7113, thereby\nensuring its continued vitality.\u201d Id., at 836\u2013837.

The Government argues\nthat \u201cany other person\u201d refers to any person not identified\nas a PRP in \u00a7\u00a7107(a)(1)\u2013(4).2 In other words, subpara\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 CERCLA  \u00a7107(a) lists four broad categories of persons as PRPs, by\ndefinition liable to other persons for various costs:\n   \u201c(1) the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility,\n   \u201c(2) any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous sub\nstance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous sub\nstances were disposed of,\n   \u201c(3) any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged\nfor disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport\nfor disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances owned or possessed\nby such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility or incinera\ntion vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing\nsuch hazardous substances, and\n   \u201c(4) any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances\nfor transport to disposal or treatment facilities, incineration vessels or\n                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngraph (B) permits suit only by non-PRPs and thus bars\nAtlantic Research\u2019s claim. Atlantic Research counters\nthat subparagraph (B) takes its cue from subparagraph\n(A), not the earlier paragraph (1)\u2013(4). In accord with the\nCourt of Appeals, Atlantic Research believes that sub\nparagraph (B) provides a cause of action to anyone except\nthe United States, a State, or an Indian tribe\u2014the persons\nlisted in subparagraph (A). We agree with Atlantic\nResearch.\n   Statutes must \u201cbe read as a whole.\u201d King v. St. Vin\ncent\u2019s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991). Applying that\nmaxim, the language of suparagraph (B) can be under\nstood only with reference to subparagraph (A). The provi\nsions are adjacent and have remarkably similar struc\ntures.    Each concerns certain costs that have been\nincurred by certain entities and that bear a specified\nrelationship to the national contingency plan.3 Bolstering\nthe structural link, the text also denotes a relationship\nbetween the two provisions. By using the phrase \u201cother\nnecessary costs,\u201d subparagraph (B) refers to and differen\ntiates the relevant costs from those listed in subparagraph\n(A).\n   In light of the relationship between the subparagraph, it\nis natural to read the phrase \u201cany other person\u201d by refer\nring to the immediately preceding subparagraph (A),\nwhich permits suit only by the United States, a State, or\nan Indian tribe. The phrase \u201cany other person\u201d therefore\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsites selected by such person, from which there is a release, or a threat\nened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazard\nous substance, shall be liable for [various costs].\u201d          42 U.

Aviall\nServices, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 161, n. 2 (2004) (citing 40 CFR pt. 300\n(2004)).\n6       UNITED STATES v. ATLANTIC RESEARCH CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmeans any person other than those three. See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a79601(21) (defining \u201cperson\u201d to include the United States\nand the various States). Consequently, the plain language\nof subparagraph (B) authorizes cost-recovery actions by\nany private party, including PRPs. See Key Tronic, 511\nU. S., at 818 (stating in dictum that \u00a7107 \u201cimpliedly au\nthorizes private parties to recover cleanup costs from other\nPRP[s]\u201d (emphasis added)).\n  The Government\u2019s interpretation makes little textual\nsense. In subparagraph (B), the phrase \u201cany other neces\nsary costs\u201d and the phrase \u201cany other person\u201d both refer to\nantecedents\u2014\u201ccosts\u201d and \u201cperson[s]\u201d\u2014located in some\nprevious statutory provision. Although \u201cany other neces\nsary costs\u201d clearly references the costs in subparagraph\n(A), the Government would inexplicably interpret \u201cany\nother person\u201d to refer not to the persons listed in subpara\ngraph (A) but to the persons listed as PRPs in paragraphs\n(1)\u2013(4). Nothing in the text of \u00a7107(a)(4)(B) suggests an\nintent to refer to antecedents located in two different\nstatutory provisions. Reading the statute in the manner\nsuggested by the Government would destroy the symmetry\nof \u00a7\u00a7107(a)(4)(A) and (B) and render subparagraph (B)\ninternally confusing.\n  Moreover, the statute defines PRPs so broadly as to\nsweep in virtually all persons likely to incur cleanup costs.\nHence, if PRPs do not qualify as \u201cany other person\u201d for\npurposes of \u00a7107(a)(4)(B), it is unclear what private party\nwould. The Government posits that \u00a7107(a)(4)(B) author\nizes relief for \u201cinnocent\u201d private parties\u2014for instance, a\nlandowner whose land has been contaminated by another.\nBut even parties not responsible for contamination may\nfall within the broad definitions of PRPs in \u00a7\u00a7107(a)(1)\u2013\n(4). See 42 U. S. C. \u00a79607(a)(1) (listing \u201cthe owner and\noperator of a . . . facility\u201d as a PRP); see also United States\nv.

Accord\ningly, accepting the Government\u2019s interpretation would\nreduce the number of potential plaintiffs to almost zero,\nrendering \u00a7107(a)(4)(B) a dead letter.4 See Louisville &\nNashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 467, 475 (1911) (\u201cWe\nmust have regard to all the words used by Congress, and\nas far as possible give effect to them\u201d).\n  According to the Government, our interpretation suffers\nfrom the same infirmity because it causes the phrase \u201cany\nother person\u201d to duplicate work done by other text. In the\nGovernment\u2019s view, the phrase \u201cany other necessary costs\u201d\n\u201calready precludes governmental entities from recovering\nunder\u201d \u00a7107(a)(4)(B). Brief for United States 20. Even\nassuming the Government is correct, it does not alter our\nconclusion. The phrase \u201cany other person\u201d performs a\nsignificant function simply by clarifying that subpara\ngraph (B) excludes the persons enumerated in subpara\ngraph (A). In any event, our hesitancy to construe stat\nutes to render language superfluous does not require us to\navoid surplusage at all costs. It is appropriate to tolerate\na degree of surplusage rather than adopt a textually dubi\nous construction that threatens to render the entire provi\nsion a nullity.\n                            B\n  The Government also argues that our interpretation will\ncreate friction between \u00a7107(a) and \u00a7113(f), the very harm\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Congress amended the statute in 2002 to exempt some bona fide\n\nprospective purchasers (BFPPs) from liability under \u00a7107(a). See 42\nU. S. C. \u00a79607(r)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The Government claims that\nthese persons are non-PRPs and therefore qualify as \u201cany other person\u201d\nunder its interpretation of \u00a7107(a)(4)(B). Prior to 2002, however, the\nstatute made this small set of persons liable as PRPs. Accordingly,\neven if BFPPs now give some life to the Government\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a7107(a)(4)(B), it would be implausible at best to conclude that\n\u00a7107(a)(4)(B) lay dormant until the enactment of \u00a7107(r)(1) in 2002.\n8      UNITED STATES v. ATLANTIC RESEARCH CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts of appeals have previously tried to avoid. In par\nticular, the Government maintains that our interpreta\ntion, by offering PRPs a choice between \u00a7107(a) and\n\u00a7113(f), effectively allows PRPs to circumvent \u00a7113(f)\u2019s\nshorter statute of limitations.             See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a79613(g)(2)\u2013(3). Furthermore, the Government argues,\nPRPs will eschew equitable apportionment under \u00a7113(f)\nin favor of joint and several liability under \u00a7107(a). Fi\nnally, the Government contends that our interpretation\neviscerates the settlement bar set forth in \u00a7113(f)(2).\n   We have previously recognized that \u00a7\u00a7107(a) and 113(f)\nprovide two \u201cclearly distinct\u201d remedies. Cooper Industries,\n543 U. S., at 163, n. 3. \u201cCERCLA provide[s] for a right to\ncost recovery in certain circumstances, \u00a7107(a), and sepa\nrate rights to contribution in other circumstances,\n\u00a7\u00a7113(f)(1), 113(f)(3)(B).\u201d Id., at 163 (emphases added).\nThe Government, however, uses the word \u201ccontribution\u201d as\nif it were synonymous with any apportionment of expenses\namong PRPs. Brief for United States 33, n. 14 (\u201cContribu\ntion is merely a form of cost recovery, not a wholly inde\npendent type of relief\u201d); see also, e.g., Pinal Creek Group v.\nNewmont Mining Corp., 118 F. 3d 1298, 1301 (CA9 1997)\n(\u201cBecause all PRPs are liable under the statute, a claim by\none PRP against another PRP necessarily is for contribu\ntion\u201d). This imprecise usage confuses the complementary\nyet distinct nature of the rights established in \u00a7\u00a7107(a)\nand 113(f).\n   Section 113(f) explicitly grants PRPs a right to contribu\ntion. Contribution is defined as the \u201ctortfeasor\u2019s right to\ncollect from others responsible for the same tort after the\ntortfeasor has paid more than his or her proportionate\nshare, the shares being determined as a percentage of\nfault.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 353 (8th ed. 1999). Noth\ning in \u00a7113(f) suggests that Congress used the term \u201ccon\ntribution\u201d in anything other than this traditional sense.\nThe statute authorizes a PRP to seek contribution \u201cduring\n                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nor following\u201d a suit under \u00a7106 or \u00a7107(a). 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a79613(f)(1).5 Thus, \u00a7113(f)(1) permits suit before or after\nthe establishment of common liability. In either case, a\nPRP\u2019s right to contribution under \u00a7113(f)(1) is contingent\nupon an inequitable distribution of common liability\namong liable parties.\n   By contrast, \u00a7107(a) permits recovery of cleanup costs\nbut does not create a right to contribution. A private\nparty may recover under \u00a7107(a) without any establish\nment of liability to a third party. Moreover, \u00a7107(a) per\nmits a PRP to recover only the costs it has \u201cincurred\u201d in\ncleaning up a site. 42 U. S. C. \u00a79607(a)(4)(B). When a\nparty pays to satisfy a settlement agreement or a court\njudgment, it does not incur its own costs of response.\nRather, it reimburses other parties for costs that those\nparties incurred.\n   Accordingly, the remedies available in \u00a7\u00a7107(a) and\n113(f) complement each other by providing causes of ac\ntion \u201cto persons in different procedural circumstances.\u201d\nConsolidated Edison, 423 F. 3d, at 99; see also E. I. Du\npont de Nemours, 460 F. 3d, at 548 (Sloviter, J., dissent\ning). Section 113(f)(1) authorizes a contribution action to\nPRPs with common liability stemming from an action\ninstituted under \u00a7106 or \u00a7107(a). And \u00a7107(a) permits\ncost recovery (as distinct from contribution) by a private\nparty that has itself incurred cleanup costs. Hence, a PRP\nthat pays money to satisfy a settlement agreement or a\ncourt judgment may pursue \u00a7113(f) contribution. But by\nreimbursing response costs paid by other parties, the PRP\nhas not incurred its own costs of response and therefore\ncannot recover under \u00a7107(a). As a result, though eligible\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Similarly, \u00a7113(f)(3)(B) permits a PRP to seek contribution after it\n\u201chas resolved its liability to the United States or a State . . . in an\nadministrative or judicially approved settlement . . . .\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a79613(f)(3)(B).\n10       UNITED STATES v. ATLANTIC RESEARCH CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto seek contribution under \u00a7113(f)(1), the PRP cannot\nsimultaneously seek to recover the same expenses under\n\u00a7107(a). Thus, at least in the case of reimbursement, the\nPRP cannot choose the 6-year statute of limitations for\ncost-recovery actions over the shorter limitations period\nfor \u00a7113(f) contribution claims.6\n   For similar reasons, a PRP could not avoid \u00a7113(f)\u2019s\nequitable distribution of reimbursement costs among\nPRPs by instead choosing to impose joint and several\nliability on another PRP in an action under \u00a7107(a).7 The\nchoice of remedies simply does not exist. In any event, a\ndefendant PRP in such a \u00a7107(a) suit could blunt any\ninequitable distribution of costs by filing a \u00a7113(f) counter\nclaim. 459 F. 3d, at 835; see also Consolidated Edison,\nsupra, at 100, n. 9 (collecting cases). Resolution of a\n\u00a7113(f) counter-claim would necessitate the equitable\napportionment of costs among the liable parties, including\nthe PRP that filed the \u00a7107(a) action.           42 U. S. C.\n\u00a79613(f)(a) (\u201cIn resolving contribution claims, the court\nmay allocate response costs among liable parties using\nsuch equitable factors as the court determines are appro\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 We do not suggest that \u00a7\u00a7107(a)(4)(B) and 113(f) have no overlap at\n\nall. Key Tronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U. S. 809, 816 (1994) (stat\ning the statutes provide \u201csimilar and somewhat overlapping\nremed[ies]\u201d). For instance, we recognize that a PRP may sustain\nexpenses pursuant to a consent decree following a suit under \u00a7106 or\n\u00a7107(a). See, e.g., United Technologies Corp. v. Browning-Ferris Indus\ntries, Inc., 33 F. 3d 96, 97 (CA1 1994). In such a case, the PRP does not\nincur costs voluntarily but does not reimburse the costs of another\nparty. We do not decide whether these compelled costs of response are\nrecoverable under \u00a7113(f), \u00a7107(a), or both. For our purposes, it suffices\nto demonstrate that costs incurred voluntarily are recoverable only by\nway of \u00a7107(a)(4)(B), and costs of reimbursement to another person\npursuant to a legal judgment or settlement are recoverable only under\n\u00a7113(f). Thus, at a minimum, neither remedy swallows the other,\ncontrary to the Government\u2019s argument.\n   7 We assume without deciding that \u00a7107(a) provides for joint and\n\nseveral liability.\n                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npriate\u201d).\n   Finally, permitting PRPs to seek recovery under \u00a7107(a)\nwill not eviscerate the settlement bar set forth in\n\u00a7113(f)(2). That provision prohibits \u00a7113(f) contribution\nclaims against \u201c[a] person who has resolved its liability to\nthe United States or a State in an administrative or judi\ncially approved settlement . . . .\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a79613(f)(2).\nThe settlement bar does not by its terms protect against\ncost-recovery liability under \u00a7107(a). For several reasons,\nwe doubt this supposed loophole would discourage settle\nment. First, as stated above, a defendant PRP may trig\nger equitable apportionment by filing a \u00a7113(f) counter\nclaim. A district court applying traditional rules of equity\nwould undoubtedly consider any prior settlement as part\nof the liability calculus. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\u00a7886A(2), p. 337 (1977) (\u201cNo tortfeasor can be required to\nmake contribution beyond his own equitable share of the\nliability\u201d). Second, the settlement bar continues to provide\nsignificant protection from contribution suits by PRPs that\nhave inequitably reimbursed the costs incurred by another\nparty. Third, settlement carries the inherent benefit of\nfinally resolving liability as to the United States or a\nState.8\n                            III\n   Because the plain terms of \u00a7107(a)(4)(B) allow a PRP to\nrecover costs from other PRPs, the statute provides Atlan\ntic Research with a cause of action. We therefore affirm\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Because \u00a7107(a) expressly permits PRPs to seek cost recovery, we\n\nneed not address the alternative holding of the Court of Appeals that\n\u00a7107(a) contains an additional implied right to contribution for PRPs\nwho are not eligible for relief under \u00a7113(f).

We hold that it does.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Courts have frequently grappled with whether and how PRPs may recoup CERCLA-related costs from other PRPs. The questions lie at the intersection of two statutory provisions\u0097CERCLA \u00a7\u00a7 107(a) and 113(f). Section 107(a) defines four categories of PRPs, 94 Stat. 2781, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9607(a)(1)-(4), and makes them liable for, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(A) all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State or an Indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan.\" \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(A)-(B).</blockquote>\n<p>Enacted as part of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), 100 Stat. 1613, \u00a7 113(f) authorizes one PRP to sue another for contribution in certain circumstances. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Prior to the advent of \u00a7 113(f)'s express contribution right, some courts held that \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) provided a cause of action for a private party to recover voluntarily incurred response costs and to seek contribution after having been sued. See <i>Cooper Industries, supra,</i> at 161-162, 125 S.Ct. 577 (collecting cases); <i>Key Tronic Corp. v.

After SARA's enactment, however, some Courts of Appeals believed it necessary to \"direc[t] traffic between\" \u00a7 107(a) and \u00a7 113(f). <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795381\"><a href=\"/opinion/795381/atlantic-research-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></a></span>, 832 (C.A.8 2006) (case below). As a result, many Courts of Appeals held that \u00a7 113(f) was the exclusive remedy for PRPs. See <i>Cooper Industries, supra,</i> at 169, 125 S.Ct. 577 (collecting cases). But as courts prevented PRPs from suing under \u00a7 107(a), they expanded \u00a7 113(f) to allow PRPs to seek \"contribution\" even in the absence of a suit under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). <i>Aviall Servs., Inc. v.

This narrower interpretation of \u00a7 113(f) caused several Courts of Appeals to reconsider whether PRPs have rights under \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B), an issue we declined to address in <i>Cooper Industries. Id.,</i> at 168, 125 S.Ct. 577. After revisiting the issue, some courts have permitted \u00a7 107(a) actions by PRPs. See <i>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v.

Today, we resolve this issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2335</span> B</h2>\n<p>In this case, respondent Atlantic Research leased property at the Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot, a facility operated by the Department of Defense. At the site, Atlantic Research retrofitted rocket motors for petitioner United States. Using a high-pressure water spray, Atlantic Research removed pieces of propellant from the motors. It then burned the propellant pieces. Some of the resultant wastewater and burned fuel contaminated soil and groundwater at the site.</p>\n<p>Atlantic Research cleaned the site at its own expense and then sought to recover some of its costs by suing the United States under both \u00a7 107(a) and \u00a7 113(f). After our decision in <i>Cooper Industries</i> foreclosed relief under \u00a7 113(f), Atlantic Research amended its complaint to seek relief under \u00a7 107(a) and federal common law. The United States moved to dismiss, arguing that \u00a7 107(a) does not allow PRPs (such as Atlantic Research) to recover costs. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss, relying on a case decided prior to our decision in <i>Cooper Industries, Dico, Inc. v. Amoco Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783202\"><a href=\"/opinion/783202/dico-inc-v-amoco-oil-company-chevron-chemical-comp/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span> (C.A.8 2003).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed. Recognizing that <i>Cooper Industries</i> undermined the reasoning of its prior precedent, 459 F.3d, at 830, n. 4, the Court of Appeals joined the Second and Seventh Circuits in holding that \u00a7 113(f) does not provide \"the exclusive route by which [PRPs] may recover cleanup costs.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 834 (citing <i>Consolidated Edison Co., supra</i>). The court reasoned that \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) authorized suit by any person other than the persons permitted to sue under \u00a7 107(a)(4)(A). 459 F.3d, at 835. Accordingly, it held that \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) provides a cause of action to Atlantic Research. To prevent perceived conflict between \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) and \u00a7 113(f)(1), the Court of Appeals reasoned that PRPs that \"have been subject to \u00a7\u00a7 106 or 107 enforcement actions are still required to use \u00a7 113, thereby ensuring its continued vitality.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 836-837.

The Government argues that \"any other person\" refers to any person not identified as a PRP in \u00a7\u00a7 107(a)(1)-(4).<sup>[2]</sup> In other words, subparagraph (B) permits suit only by non-PRPs and thus bars Atlantic Research's claim. Atlantic Research counters that subparagraph (B) takes its cue from subparagraph <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2336</span> (A), not the earlier paragraph (1)-(4). In accord with the Court of Appeals, Atlantic Research believes that subparagraph (B) provides a cause of action to anyone except the United States, a State, or an Indian tribe\u0097the persons listed in subparagraph (A). We agree with Atlantic Research.</p>\n<p>Statutes must \"be read as a whole.\" <i>King v.

Applying that maxim, the language of subparagraph (B) can be understood only with reference to subparagraph (A). The provisions are adjacent and have remarkably similar structures. Each concerns certain costs that have been incurred by certain entities and that bear a specified relationship to the national contingency plan.<sup>[3]</sup> Bolstering the structural link, the text also denotes a relationship between the two provisions. By using the phrase \"other necessary costs,\" subparagraph (B) refers to and differentiates the relevant costs from those listed in subparagraph (A).</p>\n<p>In light of the relationship between the subparagraph, it is natural to read the phrase \"any other person\" by referring to the immediately preceding subparagraph (A), which permits suit only by the United States, a State, or an Indian tribe. The phrase \"any other person\" therefore means any person other than those three. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(21) (defining \"person\" to include the United States and the various States). Consequently, the plain language of subparagraph (B) authorizes cost-recovery actions by any private party, including PRPs. See <i>Key Tronic,</i> 511 U.S., at 818, 114 S.Ct. 1960 (stating in dictum that \u00a7 107 \"impliedly authorizes private parties to recover cleanup costs from <i>other</i> PRP[s]\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>The Government's interpretation makes little textual sense. In subparagraph (B), the phrase \"any other necessary costs\" and the phrase \"any other person\" both refer to antecedents\u0097\"costs\" and \"person[s]\"\u0097located in some previous statutory provision. Although \"any other necessary costs\" clearly references the costs in subparagraph (A), the Government would inexplicably interpret \"any other person\" to refer not to the persons listed in subparagraph (A) but to the persons listed as PRPs in paragraphs (1)-(4). Nothing in the text of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) suggests an intent to refer to antecedents located in two different statutory provisions. Reading the statute in the manner suggested by the Government would destroy the symmetry of \u00a7\u00a7 107(a)(4)(A) and (B) and render subparagraph (B) internally confusing.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the statute defines PRPs so broadly as to sweep in virtually all persons likely to incur cleanup costs. Hence, if PRPs do not qualify as \"any other person\" for purposes of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B), it is unclear what private party would. The Government posits that \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) authorizes relief for \"innocent\" private parties\u0097for instance, a landowner whose land has been contaminated by another. But even parties not responsible for contamination may fall within the broad definitions of PRPs in \u00a7\u00a7 107(a)(1)-(4). See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(1) (listing \"the owner and operator of a ... facility\" as a PRP); see also <i>United States v. Alcan Aluminum Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780362\"><a href=\"/opinion/780362/united-states-of-america-state-of-new-york-v-alcan/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 184 (C.A.2 2003) (\"CERCLA \u00a7 9607 is a strict liability statute\"). The Government's reading of the text logically precludes all PRPs, innocent or not, from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2337</span> recovering cleanup costs. Accordingly, accepting the Government's interpretation would reduce the number of potential plaintiffs to almost zero, rendering \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) a dead letter.<sup>[4]</sup> See <i>Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97363\"><a href=\"/opinion/97363/louisville-nashville-r-co-v-mottley/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 475, 31 S.Ct. 265, 55 L.Ed. 297 (1911) (\"We must have regard to all the words used by Congress, and as far as possible give effect to them\").</p>\n<p>According to the Government, our interpretation suffers from the same infirmity because it causes the phrase \"any other person\" to duplicate work done by other text. In the Government's view, the phrase \"any other necessary costs\" \"already precludes governmental entities from recovering under\" \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B). Brief for United States 20. Even assuming the Government is correct, it does not alter our conclusion. The phrase \"any other person\" performs a significant function simply by clarifying that subparagraph (B) excludes the persons enumerated in subparagraph (A). In any event, our hesitancy to construe statutes to render language superfluous does not require us to avoid surplusage at all costs. It is appropriate to tolerate a degree of surplusage rather than adopt a textually dubious construction that threatens to render the entire provision a nullity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Government also argues that our interpretation will create friction between \u00a7 107(a) and \u00a7 113(f), the very harm courts of appeals have previously tried to avoid. In particular, the Government maintains that our interpretation, by offering PRPs a choice between \u00a7 107(a) and \u00a7 113(f), effectively allows PRPs to circumvent \u00a7 113(f)'s shorter statute of limitations. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9613(g)(2)-(3). Furthermore, the Government argues, PRPs will eschew equitable apportionment under \u00a7 113(f) in favor of joint and several liability under \u00a7 107(a). Finally, the Government contends that our interpretation eviscerates the settlement bar set forth in \u00a7 113(f)(2).</p>\n<p>We have previously recognized that \u00a7\u00a7 107(a) and 113(f) provide two \"clearly distinct\" remedies. <i>Cooper Industries,</i> 543 U.S., at 163, n. 3, 125 S.Ct. 577. \"CERCLA provide[s] for a <i>right to cost recovery</i> in certain circumstances, \u00a7 107(a), and <i>separate rights to contribution</i> in other circumstances, \u00a7\u00a7 113(f)(1), 113(f)(3)(B).\" <i>Id.,</i> at 163, 125 S.Ct. 577 (emphases added). The Government, however, uses the word \"contribution\" as if it were synonymous with any apportionment of expenses among PRPs. Brief for United States 33, n. 14 (\"Contribution is merely a form of cost recovery, not a wholly independent type of relief\"); see also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Pinal Creek Group v. Newmont Mining Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743632\"><a href=\"/opinion/743632/the-pinal-creek-group-consisting-of-cyprus-miami-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1298</span></a></span>, 1301 (C.A.9 1997) (\"Because all PRPs are liable under the statute, a claim by one PRP against another PRP necessarily is for contribution\"). This imprecise usage confuses the complementary yet distinct nature of the rights established in \u00a7\u00a7 107(a) and 113(f).</p>\n<p>Section 113(f) explicitly grants PRPs a right to contribution. Contribution <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2338</span> is defined as the \"tortfeasor's right to collect from others responsible for the same tort after the tortfeasor has paid more than his or her proportionate share, the shares being determined as a percentage of fault.\" Black's Law Dictionary 353 (8th ed.1999). Nothing in \u00a7 113(f) suggests that Congress used the term \"contribution\" in anything other than this traditional sense. The statute authorizes a PRP to seek contribution \"during or following\" a suit under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1).<sup>[5]</sup> Thus, \u00a7 113(f)(1) permits suit before or after the establishment of common liability. In either case, a PRP's right to contribution under \u00a7 113(f)(1) is contingent upon an inequitable distribution of common liability among liable parties.</p>\n<p>By contrast, \u00a7 107(a) permits recovery of cleanup costs but does not create a right to contribution. A private party may recover under \u00a7 107(a) without any establishment of liability to a third party. Moreover, \u00a7 107(a) permits a PRP to recover only the costs it has \"incurred\" in cleaning up a site. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(B). When a party pays to satisfy a settlement agreement or a court judgment, it does not incur its own costs of response. Rather, it reimburses other parties for costs that those parties incurred.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the remedies available in \u00a7\u00a7 107(a) and 113(f) complement each other by providing causes of action \"to persons in different procedural circumstances.\" <i>Consolidated Edison,</i> 423 F.3d, at 99; see also <i>E.I. DuPont de Nemours,</i> 460 F.3d, at 548 (Sloviter, J., dissenting). Section 113(f)(1) authorizes a contribution action to PRPs with common liability stemming from an action instituted under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). And \u00a7 107(a) permits cost recovery (as distinct from contribution) by a private party that has itself incurred cleanup costs. Hence, a PRP that pays money to satisfy a settlement agreement or a court judgment may pursue \u00a7 113(f) contribution. But by reimbursing response costs paid by other parties, the PRP has not incurred its own costs of response and therefore cannot recover under \u00a7 107(a). As a result, though eligible to seek contribution under \u00a7 113(f)(1), the PRP cannot simultaneously seek to recover the same expenses under \u00a7 107(a). Thus, at least in the case of reimbursement, the PRP cannot choose the 6-year statute of limitations for cost-recovery actions over the shorter limitations period for \u00a7 113(f) contribution claims.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>For similar reasons, a PRP could not avoid \u00a7 113(f)'s equitable distribution of reimbursement costs among PRPs by instead <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2339</span> choosing to impose joint and several liability on another PRP in an action under \u00a7 107(a).<sup>[7]</sup> The choice of remedies simply does not exist. In any event, a defendant PRP in such a \u00a7 107(a) suit could blunt any inequitable distribution of costs by filing a \u00a7 113(f) counterclaim. 459 F.3d, at 835; see also <i>Consolidated Edison, supra,</i> at 100, n. 9 (collecting cases). Resolution of a \u00a7 113(f) counter-claim would necessitate the equitable apportionment of costs among the liable parties, including the PRP that filed the \u00a7 107(a) action. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(a) (\"In resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate\").</p>\n<p>Finally, permitting PRPs to seek recovery under \u00a7 107(a) will not eviscerate the settlement bar set forth in \u00a7 113(f)(2). That provision prohibits \u00a7 113(f) contribution claims against \"[a] person who has resolved its liability to the United States or a State in an administrative or judicially approved settlement ... .\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(2). The settlement bar does not by its terms protect against cost-recovery liability under \u00a7 107(a). For several reasons, we doubt this supposed loophole would discourage settlement. First, as stated above, a defendant PRP may trigger equitable apportionment by filing a \u00a7 113(f) counterclaim. A district court applying traditional rules of equity would undoubtedly consider any prior settlement as part of the liability calculus. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 886A(2), p. 337 (1977) (\"No tortfeasor can be required to make contribution beyond his own equitable share of the liability\"). Second, the settlement bar continues to provide significant protection from contribution suits by PRPs that have inequitably reimbursed the costs incurred by another party. Third, settlement carries the inherent benefit of finally resolving liability as to the United States or a State.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Because the plain terms of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) allow a PRP to recover costs from other PRPs, the statute provides Atlantic Research with a cause of action. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 113(f)(1) permits private parties to seek contribution during or following a civil action under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1). Section 113(f)(3)(B) permits private parties to seek contribution after they have settled their liability with the Government. \u00a7 9613(f)(3)(B).</p>\n<p>[2]  CERCLA \u00a7 107(a) lists four broad categories of persons as PRPs, by definition liable to other persons for various costs:\n</p>\n<p>\"(1) the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility,</p>\n<p>\"(2) any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of,</p>\n<p>\"(3) any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances, and</p>\n<p>\"(4) any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities, incineration vessels or sites selected by such person, from which there is a release, or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance, shall be liable for [various costs].\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9607(a)(1)-(4).</p>\n<p>[3]  \"The national contingency plan specifies procedures for preparing and responding to contaminations and was promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency ... .\" <i>Cooper Industries Inc. v.

See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(r)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The Government claims that these persons are non-PRPs and therefore qualify as \"any other person\" under its interpretation of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B). Prior to 2002, however, the statute made this small set of persons liable as PRPs. Accordingly, even if BFPPs now give some life to the Government's interpretation of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B), it would be implausible at best to conclude that \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) lay dormant until the enactment of \u00a7 107(r)(1) in 2002.</p>\n<p>[5]  Similarly, \u00a7 113(f)(3)(B) permits a PRP to seek contribution after it \"has resolved its liability to the United States or a State ... in an administrative or judicially approved settlement....\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(3)(B).</p>\n<p>[6]  We do not suggest that \u00a7\u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) and 113(f) have no overlap at all. <i>Key Tronic Corp. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087945\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087945/key-tronic-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span>, 816, 114 S.Ct. 1960, 128 L.Ed.2d 797 (1994) (stating the statutes provide \"similar and somewhat overlapping remed[ies]\"). For instance, we recognize that a PRP may sustain expenses pursuant to a consent decree following a suit under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United Technologies Corp. v. Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676987\"><a href=\"/opinion/676987/united-technologies-corporation-v-browning-ferris-/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 97 (C.A.1 1994). In such a case, the PRP does not incur costs voluntarily but does not reimburse the costs of another party. We do not decide whether these compelled costs of response are recoverable under \u00a7 113(f), \u00a7 107(a), or both. For our purposes, it suffices to demonstrate that costs incurred voluntarily are recoverable only by way of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B), and costs of reimbursement to another person pursuant to a legal judgment or settlement are recoverable only under \u00a7 113(f). Thus, at a minimum, neither remedy swallows the other, contrary to the Government's argument.</p>\n<p>[7]  We assume without deciding that \u00a7 107(a) provides for joint and several liability.</p>\n<p>[8]  Because \u00a7 107(a) expressly permits PRPs to seek cost recovery, we need not address the alternative holding of the Court of Appeals that \u00a7 107(a) contains an additional implied right to contribution for PRPs who are not eligible for relief under \u00a7 113(f).
