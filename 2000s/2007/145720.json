Moody, Deputy Attorney General, Counsel of Record, San Francisco, CA, for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We decide whether a federal habeas court must assess the prejudicial impact of constitutional error in a state-court criminal trial under the \"substantial and injurious effect\" standard set forth in <i>Brecht v. Abrahamson,</i> 507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993), when the state appellate court failed to recognize the error and did not review it for harmlessness under the \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard set forth in <i>Chapman v. California,</i> 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>After two mistrials on account of hung juries, a third jury convicted petitioner of the 1992 murders of James and Cynthia Bell. At trial, petitioner sought to attribute the murders to one or more other persons. To that end, he offered testimony of several witnesses who linked one Anthony Hurtz to the killings. But the trial court excluded the testimony of one additional witness, Pamela Maples, who was prepared to testify that she had heard Hurtz discussing homicides bearing some resemblance to the murder of the Bells. In the trial court's view, the defense had provided insufficient evidence to link the incidents described by Hurtz to the murders for which petitioner was charged.</p>\n<p>Following his conviction, petitioner appealed to the California Court of Appeal, arguing (among other things) that the trial court's exclusion of Maples' testimony deprived him of a fair opportunity to defend himself, in violation of <i>Chambers v. Mississippi,</i> 410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973) (holding that a combination of erroneous evidentiary rulings rose to the level of a due process violation). Without explicitly addressing petitioner's <i>Chambers</i> argument, the state appellate court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in excluding Maples' testimony under California's evidentiary rules, adding that \"no possible prejudice\" could have resulted in light of the \"merely cumulative\" nature of the testimony. <i>People v. Fry,</i> No. A072396 (Ct.App.Cal., 1st App. Dist., Mar. 30, 2000), App. 97, n. 17. The court did not specify which harmless-error standard it was applying in concluding that petitioner suffered \"no possible prejudice.\" The Supreme Court of California denied discretionary review, and petitioner did not then seek a writ of certiorari from this Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioner next filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, raising the aforementioned due-process claim (among others). The case was initially assigned to a Magistrate Judge, who ultimately recommended denying relief. He found the state appellate court's failure to recognize error under <i>Chambers</i> to be \"an unreasonable application of clearly established law as set forth by the Supreme Court,\" App. 180, and disagreed with the state appellate court's finding of \"no possible prejudice.\" But he nevertheless concluded that \"there ha[d] been an insufficient showing that the improper exclusion of the testimony of Ms. Maples had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury's verdict\" under the standard set forth in <i>Brecht.</i> App. 181-182. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's findings and recommendations in full, and a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. We granted certiorari. 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 763, 166 L.Ed.2d 590 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2325</span> II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In <i>Chapman, supra,</i> a case that reached this Court <i>on direct review</i> of a state-court criminal judgment, we held that a federal constitutional error can be considered harmless only if a court is \"able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 24, 87 S.Ct. 824. In <i>Brecht, supra,</i> we considered whether the <i>Chapman</i> standard of review applies <i>on collateral review</i> of a state-court criminal judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Citing concerns about finality, comity, and federalism, we rejected the <i>Chapman</i> standard in favor of the more forgiving standard of review applied to nonconstitutional errors on direct appeal from federal convictions. See <i>Kotteakos v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). Under that standard, an error is harmless unless it \"`had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.'\" <i>Brecht, supra,</i> at 631, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (quoting <i>Kotteakos, supra,</i> at 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239). The question in this case is whether a federal court must assess the prejudicial impact of the unconstitutional exclusion of evidence during a state-court criminal trial under <i>Brecht</i> even if the state appellate court has not found, as the state appellate court in <i>Brecht</i> had found, that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <i>Chapman.</i><sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>We begin with the Court's opinion in <i>Brecht.</i> The primary reasons it gave for adopting a less onerous standard on collateral review of state-court criminal judgments did not turn on whether the state court itself conducted <i>Chapman</i> review. The opinion explained that application of <i>Chapman</i> would \"undermin[e] the States' interest in finality,\" 507 U.S., at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710; would \"infring[e] upon [the States'] sovereignty over criminal matters,\" <i>ibid.;</i> would undercut the historic limitation of habeas relief to those \"`grievously wronged,'\" <i>ibid.;</i> and would \"impos[e] significant `societal costs,'\" <i>ibid.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Mechanik,</i> 475 U.S. 66, 72, 106 S.Ct. 938, 89 L.Ed.2d 50 (1986)). Since each of these concerns applies with equal force whether or not the state court reaches the <i>Chapman</i> question, it would be illogical to make the standard of review turn upon that contingency.</p>\n<p>The opinion in <i>Brecht</i> clearly assumed that the <i>Kotteakos</i> standard would apply in virtually all \u00a7 2254 cases. It suggested an exception only for the \"unusual case\" in which \"a deliberate and especially egregious error of the trial type, or one that is combined with a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct ... infect[s] the integrity of the proceeding.\" 507 U.S., at 638, n. 9, 113 S.Ct. 1710. This, of course, has nothing to do with whether the state court conducted harmless-error review. The concurring and dissenting opinions shared the assumption that <i>Kotteakos</i> would almost always be the standard on collateral review. The former stated in categorical terms that the \"<i>Kotteakos</i> standard\" \"will now apply on collateral review\" of state convictions, 507 U.S., at 643, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (STEVENS, J., concurring). Justice White's dissent complained that under the Court's opinion <i>Kotteakos</i> would apply even where (as in this case) the state court found that \"no violation had occurred,\" 507 U.S., at 644, 113 S.Ct. 1710; and Justice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2326</span> O'Connor's dissent stated that <i>Chapman</i> would \"no longer appl[y] to <i>any</i> trial error asserted on habeas,\" 507 U.S., at 651, 113 S.Ct. 1710. Later cases also assumed that <i>Brecht's</i> applicability does not turn on whether the state appellate court recognized the constitutional error and reached the <i>Chapman</i> question. See <i>Penry v. Johnson,</i> 532 U.S. 782, 795, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001); <i>Calderon v. Coleman,</i> 525 U.S. 141, 145, 119 S.Ct. 500, 142 L.Ed.2d 521 (1998) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>Petitioner's contrary position misreads (or at least exaggerates the significance of) a lone passage from our <i>Brecht</i> opinion. In that passage, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"State courts are fully qualified to identify constitutional error and evaluate its prejudicial effect on the trial process under <i>Chapman,</i> and state courts often occupy a superior vantage point from which to evaluate the effect of trial error. For these reasons, it scarcely seems logical to require federal habeas courts to engage in the identical approach to harmless-error review that <i>Chapman</i> requires state courts to engage in on direct review.\" 507 U.S., at 636, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>But the quoted passage does little to advance petitioner's position. To say (a) that since state courts are <i>required</i> to evaluate constitutional error under <i>Chapman</i> it makes no sense to establish <i>Chapman</i> as the standard for federal habeas review is not at all to say (b) that whenever a state court fails in its responsibility to apply <i>Chapman</i> the federal habeas standard must change. It would be foolish to equate the two, in view of the other weighty reasons given in <i>Brecht</i> for applying a less onerous standard on collateral review\u0097reasons having nothing to do with whether the state court actually applied <i>Chapman.</i></p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that, if <i>Brecht</i> applies whether or not the state appellate court conducted <i>Chapman</i> review, then <i>Brecht</i> would apply even if a State <i>eliminated appellate review altogether.</i> That is not necessarily so. The federal habeas review rule applied to the class of case in which state appellate review is available does not have to be the same rule applied to the class of case where it is not. We have no occasion to resolve that hypothetical (and highly unrealistic) question now. In the case before us petitioner <i>did</i> obtain appellate review of his constitutional claim; the state court simply found the underlying claim weak and therefore did not measure its prejudicial impact under <i>Chapman.</i> The attempted analogy\u0097between (1) eliminating appellate review altogether and (2) providing appellate review but rejecting a constitutional claim without assessing its prejudicial impact under <i>Chapman</i>\u0097is a false one.</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends that, even if <i>Brecht</i> adopted a categorical rule, post-<i>Brecht</i> developments require a different standard of review. Three years after we decided <i>Brecht,</i> Congress passed, and the President signed, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), under which a habeas petition may not be granted unless the state court's adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States ....\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). In <i>Mitchell v. Esparza,</i> 540 U.S. 12, 124 S.Ct. 7, 157 L.Ed.2d 263 (2003) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> we held that, when a state court determines that a constitutional violation is harmless, a federal court may not award habeas relief under \u00a7 2254 unless <i>the harmlessness determination itself</i> was unreasonable. Petitioner contends that \u00a7 2254(d)(1), as interpreted in <i>Esparza,</i> eliminates the requirement that a petitioner also satisfy <i>Brecht's</i> standard. We think not. That conclusion is not suggested by <i>Esparza,</i> which had no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2327</span> reason to decide the point. Nor is it suggested by the text of AEDPA, which sets forth a precondition to the grant of habeas relief (\"a writ of habeas corpus ... shall not be granted\" unless the conditions of \u00a7 2254(d) are met), not an entitlement to it. Given our frequent recognition that AEDPA limited rather than expanded the availability of habeas relief, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), it is implausible that, without saying so, AEDPA replaced the <i>Brecht</i> standard of \"`actual prejudice,'\" 507 U.S., at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (quoting <i>United States v. Lane,</i> 474 U.S. 438, 449, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986)), with the more liberal AEDPA/<i>Chapman</i> standard which requires only that the state court's harmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt determination be unreasonable. That said, it certainly makes no sense to require formal application of <i>both</i> tests (AEDPA/<i>Chapman</i> and <i>Brecht</i>) when the latter obviously subsumes the former. Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit was correct to apply the <i>Brecht</i> standard of review in assessing the prejudicial impact of federal constitutional error in a state-court criminal trial.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioner argues that, even if <i>Brecht</i> provides the standard of review, we must still reverse the judgment below because the exclusion of Maples' testimony substantially and injuriously affected the jury's verdict in this case. That argument, however, is not fairly encompassed within the question presented. We granted certiorari to decide a question that has divided the Courts of Appeals\u0097whether <i>Brecht</i> or <i>Chapman</i> provides the appropriate standard of review when constitutional error in a state-court trial is first recognized by a federal court. Compare, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bains v. Cambra,</i> 204 F.3d 964, 976-977 (C.A.9 2000), with <i>Orndorff v. Lockhart,</i> 998 F.2d 1426, 1429-1430 (C.A.8 1993). It is true that the second sentence of the question presented asks: \"Does it matter which harmless error standard is employed?\" Pet. for Cert. I. But to ask whether <i>Brecht</i> makes any real difference is not to ask whether the Ninth Circuit misapplied <i>Brecht</i> in this particular case. Petitioner seems to have understood this. Only in a brief footnote of his petition did he hint that the Ninth Circuit erred in its application of the <i>Brecht</i> standard. Pet. for Cert. 23, n. 19.<sup>[3]</sup> Indeed, if application of the <i>Brecht</i> standard to the facts of this case were encompassed within the question presented, so too would be the question of whether there was constitutional error in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2328</span> the first place. After all, it would not \"matter which harmless error standard is employed\" if there were no underlying constitutional error. Unlike the dissenting JUSTICES, some of whom would reverse the decision below on the ground that the error was harmful under <i>Brecht,</i> and one of whom would vacate the decision below on the ground that it is unclear whether there was constitutional error in the first instance, we read the question presented to avoid these tangential and factbound questions, and limit our review to the question of whether <i>Chapman</i> or <i>Brecht</i> provides the governing standard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We hold that in \u00a7 2254 proceedings a court must assess the prejudicial impact of constitutional error in a state-court criminal trial under the \"substantial and injurious effect\" standard set forth in <i>Brecht,</i> 507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353, whether or not the state appellate court recognized the error and reviewed it for harmlessness under the \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard set forth in <i>Chapman,</i> 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705. Since the Ninth Circuit correctly applied the <i>Brecht</i> standard rather than the <i>Chapman</i> standard, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice SOUTER and Justice GINSBURG join, and with whom Justice BREYER joins in part, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>While I join all of the Court's opinion except Part II-B, I am persuaded that we should also answer the question whether the constitutional error was harmless under the standard announced in <i>Brecht v. Abrahamson,</i> 507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). The parties and the Solicitor General as <i>amicus curiae</i> fully briefed and argued the question, presumably because it appears to fit within the awkwardly drafted question that we agreed to review.<sup>[1]</sup> Moreover, our answer to the question whether the error was harmless would emphasize the important point that the <i>Brecht</i> standard, as more fully explained in our opinion in <i>Kotteakos v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), imposes a significant burden of persuasion on the State.</p>\n<p>Both the history of this litigation and the nature of the constitutional error involved provide powerful support for the conclusion that if the jurors had heard the testimony of Pamela Maples, they would at least have had a reasonable doubt concerning petitioner's guilt. Petitioner was not found guilty until after he had been tried three times. The first trial ended in a mistrial with the jury deadlocked 6 to 6. App. 121. The second trial also resulted in a mistrial due to a deadlocked jury, this time 7 to 5 in favor of conviction. <i>Ibid.</i> In the third trial, after the jurors had been deliberating for 11 days, the foreperson advised the judge that they were split 7 to 5 and \"`hopelessly deadlocked.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 74-75. When the judge instructed the jury to continue its deliberations, the foreperson requested clarification on the definition of \"reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 75. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2329</span> The jury deliberated for an additional 23 days after that exchange\u0097a total of <i>five weeks</i>\u0097before finally returning a guilty verdict.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>It is not surprising that some jurors harbored a reasonable doubt as to petitioner's guilt weeks into their deliberations. The only person to offer eyewitness testimony, a disinterested truckdriver, described the killer as a man who was 5'7\" to 5'8\" tall, weighed about 140 pounds, and had a full head of hair. Tr. 4574 (Apr. 26, 1995). Petitioner is 6'2\" tall, weighed 300 pounds at the time of the murder, and is bald. Record, Doc. No. 13, Exh. L (arrest report); <i>Ibid.,</i> Exh. M (petitioner's driver's license). Seven different witnesses linked the killings to a man named Anthony Hurtz, some testifying that Hurtz had admitted to them that he was in fact the killer. App. 60-64, 179. Each of those witnesses, unlike the truckdriver, was impeached by evidence of bias, either against Hurtz or for petitioner. <i>Id.,</i> at 61-64, 73, 179-180.</p>\n<p>However, Pamela Maples, a cousin of Hurtz's who was in all other respects a disinterested witness, did not testify at either of petitioner's first two trials. During the third trial, she testified out of the presence of the jury that she had overheard statements by Hurtz that he had committed a double murder strikingly similar to that witnessed by the truckdriver. As the Magistrate Judge found, the exclusion of Maples' testimony for lack of foundation was clear constitutional error under <i>Chambers v. Mississippi,</i> 410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973), and the State does not argue otherwise.<sup>[3]</sup> Cf. <i>Skipper v. South Carolina,</i> 476 U.S. 1, 8, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (\"The testimony of more disinterested witnesses ... would quite naturally be given much greater weight by the jury\").</p>\n<p><i>Chambers</i> error is by nature prejudicial. We have said that <i>Chambers</i> \"does not stand for the proposition that the defendant is denied a fair opportunity to defend himself whenever a state or federal rule excludes favorable evidence.\" <i>United States v. Scheffer,</i> 523 U.S. 303, 316, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). Rather, due process considerations hold sway over state evidentiary rules only when the exclusion of evidence \"undermine[s] fundamental elements of the defendant's defense.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 315, 118 S.Ct. 1261. Hence, as a matter of law and logical inference, it is well-nigh impossible for a reviewing court to conclude that such error \"did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect\" on its verdict. <i>Kotteakos,</i> 328 U.S., at 764, 66 S.Ct. 1239; see also <i>O'Neal v. McAninch,</i> 513 U.S. 432, 445, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995) (\"[W]hen a habeas court is in grave doubt as to the harmlessness of an error that affects substantial rights, it should grant relief\").</p>\n<p>It is difficult to imagine a less appropriate case for an exception to that commonsense proposition. We found in <i>Parker v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2330</span> <i>Gladden,</i> 385 U.S. 363, 87 S.Ct. 468, 17 L.Ed.2d 420 (1966) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> that 26 hours of juror deliberations in a murder trial \"indicat[ed] a difference among them as to the guilt of petitioner.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 365, 87 S.Ct. 468. Here, the jury was deprived of significant evidence of third-party guilt, and still we measure the length of deliberations by weeks, not hours. In light of the jurors' evident uncertainty, the prospect of rebutting the near-conclusive presumption that the <i>Chambers</i> error did substantial harm vanishes completely.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>We have not been shy in emphasizing that federal habeas courts do not lightly find constitutional error. See <i>Carey v. Musladin,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 649, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006). It follows that when they do find an error, they may not lightly discount its significance. Rather, a harmlessness finding requires \"fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\" <i>Kotteakos,</i> 328 U.S., at 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239. Given \"all that happened\" in this case, and given the nature of the error, I cannot agree with the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the erroneous exclusion of Maples' testimony was harmless under that standard.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that <i>Brecht v. Abrahamson,</i> 507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993), sets forth the proper standard of review. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 643, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (STEVENS, J., concurring). At the same time, I agree with Justice STEVENS that we should consider the application of the standard, that the error was not harmless, and that \"<i>Chambers</i> error is by nature prejudicial.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2329 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing <i>Chambers v. Mississippi,</i> 410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973)). Cf. <i>Kyles v. Whitley,</i> 514 U.S. 419, 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (similar statement as to errors under <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, (1963)). Nonetheless, I would remand this case rather than reversing the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>My reason arises out of the fact that here, for purposes of deciding whether <i>Chambers</i> error exists, the question of harm is inextricably tied to other aspects of the trial court's determination. The underlying evidentiary judgment at issue involved a weighing of the probative value <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2331</span> of proffered evidence against, <i>e.g.,</i> its cumulative nature, its tendency to confuse or to prejudice the jury, or the likelihood that it will simply waste the jury's time. See App. 96-97; Cal. Evid.Code Ann. \u00a7 352 (West 1995); cf. Fed. Rule Evid. 403. In this context, to find a <i>Chambers</i> error a court must take account <i>both</i> of the way in which (and extent to which) the trial court misweighed the relevant admissibility factors <i>and</i> of the extent to which doing so harmed the defendant. Moreover, to find this kind of error harmless, as the Court of Appeals found it, should preclude the possibility of a <i>Chambers</i> error; but to find this kind of error harmful does not guarantee the contrary. A garden-variety non-harmless misapplication of evidentiary principles normally will not rise to the level of a constitutional, <i>Chambers,</i> mistake. Cf., <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Scheffer,</i> 523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998).</p>\n<p>All this, it seems to me, requires reconsideration by the Court of Appeals of its <i>Chambers</i> determination. I would not consider the question whether that exclusion of evidence amounted to <i>Chambers</i> error because that question is not before us, see <i>ante,</i> at 2325, n. 1 (opinion of the Court). But the logically inseparable question of harm is before us; and that, I believe, is sufficient.</p>\n<p>I would remand the case to the Ninth Circuit so that, taking account of the points Justice STEVENS raises, <i>ante,</i> at 2328-2330, it can reconsider whether there was an error of admissibility sufficiently serious to violate <i>Chambers.</i> I therefore join the Court's opinion except as to footnote 1 and Part II-B, and I join Justice STEVENS' opinion in part.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  As this case comes to the Court, we assume (without deciding) that the state appellate court's decision affirming the exclusion of Maples' testimony was an unreasonable application of <i>Chambers v. Mississippi,</i> 410 U.S. 284, 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973). We also assume that the state appellate court did not determine the harmlessness of the error under the <i>Chapman</i> standard, notwithstanding its ambiguous conclusion that the exclusion of Maples' testimony resulted in \"no possible prejudice.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  We do not agree with petitioner's <i>amicus</i> that <i>Brecht's</i> concerns regarding the finality of state-court criminal judgments and the difficulty of retrying a defendant years after the crime \"have been largely alleviated by [AEDPA],\" which \"sets strict time limitations on habeas petitions and limits second or successive petitions as well.\" Brief for Innocence Network 7. Even cases governed by AEDPA can span a decade, as the nearly 12-year gap between petitioner's conviction and the issuance of this decision illustrates.</p>\n<p>[3]  The question presented included one additional issue: \"[I]f the <i>Brecht</i> standard applies, does the petitioner or the State bear the burden of persuasion on the question of prejudice?\" Pet. for Cert. I. We have previously held that, when a court is \"in virtual equipoise as to the harmlessness of the error\" under the <i>Brecht</i> standard, the court should \"treat the error ... as if it affected the verdict....\" <i>O'Neal v. McAninch,</i> 513 U.S. 432, 435, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995). The majority opinion below did not refer to <i>O'Neal,</i> presumably because the majority harbored no grave doubt as to the harmlessness of the error. Neither did the dissenting judge refer to <i>O'Neal,</i> presumably because she did not think the majority harbored grave doubt as to the harmlessness of the error. Moreover, the State has conceded throughout this \u00a7 2254 proceeding that it bears the burden of persuasion. Thus, there is no basis on which to conclude that the court below ignored <i>O'Neal.</i></p>\n<p>[1]  In <i>Brecht</i> itself the application of the standard of <i>Kotteakos v.

We nonetheless found it appropriate to rule on whether the error was harmless under that standard.

Argued March 20, 2007\u2014Decided June 11, 2007\nThe trial judge presiding over petitioner\u2019s criminal trial excluded the\n  testimony of defense-witness Pamela Maples. After his conviction,\n  petitioner argued on appeal, inter alia, that the exclusion of Maples\u2019\n  testimony violated Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, which\n  held that a combination of erroneous evidentiary rulings rose to the\n  level of a due-process violation. The California Court of Appeal did\n  not explicitly address that argument in affirming, but stated, without\n  specifying which harmless-error standard it was applying, that \u201cno\n  possible prejudice\u201d could have resulted in light of the cumulative na\n  ture of Maples\u2019 testimony. The State Supreme Court denied discre\n  tionary review. Petitioner then filed a federal habeas petition raising\n  the due-process and other claims. The Magistrate Judge found the\n  state appellate court\u2019s failure to recognize Chambers error an unrea\n  sonable application of clearly established law as set forth by this\n  Court, and disagreed with the finding of \u201cno possible prejudice,\u201d but\n  concluded there was an insufficient showing that the improper exclu\n  sion of Maples\u2019 testimony had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on\n  the jury\u2019s verdict under Brecht v.

S., at 637. Since each of\n    these concerns applies with equal force whether or not the state court\n    reaches the Chapman question, it would be illogical to make the\n    standard of review turn upon that contingency. Brecht, supra, at\n    636, distinguished. Petitioner presents a false analogy in arguing\n    that, if Brecht applies whether or not the state appellate court con\n    ducted Chapman review, then Brecht would apply even if a State\n    eliminated appellate review altogether. The Court also rejects peti\n    tioner\u2019s contention that, even if Brecht adopted a categorical rule,\n    post-Brecht developments\u2014the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\n    Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), as interpreted in Mitchell v.

Abrahamson, 507\nU. S. 619 (1993), when the state appellate court failed to\nrecognize the error and did not review it for harmlessness\nunder the \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard\nset forth in Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967).\n                            I\n  After two mistrials on account of hung juries, a third\njury convicted petitioner of the 1992 murders of James\nand Cynthia Bell. At trial, petitioner sought to attribute\nthe murders to one or more other persons. To that end, he\noffered testimony of several witnesses who linked one\nAnthony Hurtz to the killings. But the trial court ex\ncluded the testimony of one additional witness, Pamela\nMaples, who was prepared to testify that she had heard\nHurtz discussing homicides bearing some resemblance to\nthe murder of the Bells. In the trial court\u2019s view, the\ndefense had provided insufficient evidence to link the\n2                      FRY v. PLILER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nincidents described by Hurtz to the murders for which\npetitioner was charged.\n   Following his conviction, petitioner appealed to the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal, arguing (among other things)\nthat the trial court\u2019s exclusion of Maples\u2019 testimony de\nprived him of a fair opportunity to defend himself, in\nviolation of Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284 (1973)\n(holding that a combination of erroneous evidentiary\nrulings rose to the level of a due process violation). With\nout explicitly addressing petitioner\u2019s Chambers argument,\nthe state appellate court held that the trial court had not\nabused its discretion in excluding Maples\u2019 testimony under\nCalifornia\u2019s evidentiary rules, adding that \u201cno possible\nprejudice\u201d could have resulted in light of the \u201cmerely\ncumulative\u201d nature of the testimony. People v. Fry, No.\nA072396 (Ct. App. Cal., 1st App. Dist., Mar. 30, 2000),\nApp. 97, n. 17. The court did not specify which harmless-\nerror standard it was applying in concluding that peti\ntioner suffered \u201cno possible prejudice.\u201d The Supreme\nCourt of California denied discretionary review, and peti\ntioner did not then seek a writ of certiorari from this\nCourt.\n   Petitioner next filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus\nin the United States District Court for the Eastern Dis\ntrict of California, raising the aforementioned due-process\nclaim (among others). The case was initially assigned to a\nMagistrate Judge, who ultimately recommended denying\nrelief. He found the state appellate court\u2019s failure to\nrecognize error under Chambers to be \u201can unreasonable\napplication of clearly established law as set forth by the\nSupreme Court,\u201d App. 180, and disagreed with the state\nappellate court\u2019s finding of \u201cno possible prejudice.\u201d But he\nnevertheless concluded that \u201cthere ha[d] been an insuffi\ncient showing that the improper exclusion of the testimony\nof Ms. Maples had a substantial and injurious effect on the\njury\u2019s verdict\u201d under the standard set forth in Brecht.\n                    Cite as: 551 U.

The District Court adopted the Magistrate\nJudge\u2019s findings and recommendations in full, and a di\nvided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit affirmed. We granted certiorari. 549 U.

In\nBrecht, supra, we considered whether the Chapman stan\ndard of review applies on collateral review of a state-court\ncriminal judgment under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254. Citing con\ncerns about finality, comity, and federalism, we rejected\nthe Chapman standard in favor of the more forgiving\nstandard of review applied to nonconstitutional errors on\ndirect appeal from federal convictions. See Kotteakos v.\nUnited States, 328 U. S. 750 (1946). Under that standard,\nan error is harmless unless it \u201c \u2018had substantial and injuri\nous effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d\nBrecht, supra, at 631 (quoting Kotteakos, supra, at 776).\nThe question in this case is whether a federal court must\nassess the prejudicial impact of the unconstitutional ex\nclusion of evidence during a state-court criminal trial\nunder Brecht even if the state appellate court has not\nfound, as the state appellate court in Brecht had found,\nthat the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\nunder Chapman.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As this case comes to the Court, we assume (without deciding) that\n\nthe state appellate court\u2019s decision affirming the exclusion of Maples\u2019\ntestimony was an unreasonable application of Chambers v. Mississippi,\n410 U. S. 284, 302 (1973). We also assume that the state appellate\ncourt did not determine the harmlessness of the error under the Chap\n4                         FRY v. PLILER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n    We begin with the Court\u2019s opinion in Brecht. The pri\nmary reasons it gave for adopting a less onerous standard\non collateral review of state-court criminal judgments did\nnot turn on whether the state court itself conducted\nChapman review. The opinion explained that application\nof Chapman would \u201cundermin[e] the States\u2019 interest in\nfinality,\u201d 507 U. S., at 637; would \u201cinfring[e] upon [the\nStates\u2019] sovereignty over criminal matters,\u201d ibid.; would\nundercut the historic limitation of habeas relief to those\n\u201c \u2018grievously wronged,\u2019 \u201d ibid.; and would \u201cimpos[e] signifi\ncant \u2018societal costs,\u2019 \u201d ibid. (quoting United States\nv. Mechanik, 475 U. S. 66, 72 (1986)). Since each of\nthese concerns applies with equal force whether or not the\nstate court reaches the Chapman question, it would be\nillogical to make the standard of review turn upon that\ncontingency.\n    The opinion in Brecht clearly assumed that the Kot\nteakos standard would apply in virtually all \u00a72254 cases.\nIt suggested an exception only for the \u201cunusual case\u201d in\nwhich \u201ca deliberate and especially egregious error of the\ntrial type, or one that is combined with a pattern of prose\ncutorial misconduct . . . infect[s] the integrity of the pro\nceeding.\u201d 507 U. S., at 638, n. 9. This, of course, has\nnothing to do with whether the state court conducted\nharmless-error review. The concurring and dissenting\nopinions shared the assumption that Kotteakos would\nalmost always be the standard on collateral review. The\nformer stated in categorical terms that the \u201cKotteakos\nstandard\u201d \u201cwill now apply on collateral review\u201d of state\nconvictions, 507 U. S., at 643 (STEVENS, J., concurring).\nJustice White\u2019s dissent complained that under the Court\u2019s\nopinion Kotteakos would apply even where (as in this case)\nthe state court found that \u201cno violation had occurred,\u201d 507\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nman standard, notwithstanding its ambiguous conclusion that the\n\nexclusion of Maples\u2019 testimony resulted in \u201cno possible prejudice.\u201d \n\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 644; and Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s dissent stated that\nChapman would \u201cno longer appl[y] to any trial error as\nserted on habeas,\u201d 507 U. S., at 651. Later cases also\nassumed that Brecht\u2019s applicability does not turn on\nwhether the state appellate court recognized the constitu\ntional error and reached the Chapman question. See\nPenry v. Johnson, 532 U. S. 782, 795 (2001); Calderon v.\nColeman, 525 U. S. 141, 145 (1998) (per curiam).\n   Petitioner\u2019s contrary position misreads (or at least exag\ngerates the significance of) a lone passage from our Brecht\nopinion. In that passage, the Court explained:\n    \u201cState courts are fully qualified to identify constitu\n    tional error and evaluate its prejudicial effect on the\n    trial process under Chapman, and state courts often\n    occupy a superior vantage point from which to evalu\n    ate the effect of trial error. For these reasons, it\n    scarcely seems logical to require federal habeas courts\n    to engage in the identical approach to harmless-error\n    review that Chapman requires state courts to engage\n    in on direct review.\u201d 507 U. S., at 636 (citation\n    omitted).\nBut the quoted passage does little to advance petitioner\u2019s\nposition. To say (a) that since state courts are required to\nevaluate constitutional error under Chapman it makes no\nsense to establish Chapman as the standard for federal\nhabeas review is not at all to say (b) that whenever a state\ncourt fails in its responsibility to apply Chapman the\nfederal habeas standard must change. It would be foolish\nto equate the two, in view of the other weighty reasons\ngiven in Brecht for applying a less onerous standard on\ncollateral review\u2014reasons having nothing to do with\nwhether the state court actually applied Chapman.\n  Petitioner argues that, if Brecht applies whether or not\nthe state appellate court conducted Chapman review, then\nBrecht would apply even if a State eliminated appellate\n6                      FRY v. PLILER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreview altogether. That is not necessarily so. The federal\nhabeas review rule applied to the class of case in which\nstate appellate review is available does not have to be the\nsame rule applied to the class of case where it is not. We\nhave no occasion to resolve that hypothetical (and highly\nunrealistic) question now. In the case before us petitioner\ndid obtain appellate review of his constitutional claim; the\nstate court simply found the underlying claim weak and\ntherefore did not measure its prejudicial impact under\nChapman. The attempted analogy\u2014between (1) eliminat\ning appellate review altogether and (2) providing appellate\nreview but rejecting a constitutional claim without assess\ning its prejudicial impact under Chapman\u2014is a false one.\n   Petitioner contends that, even if Brecht adopted a cate\ngorical rule, post-Brecht developments require a different\nstandard of review. Three years after we decided Brecht,\nCongress passed, and the President signed, the Antiterror\nism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),\nunder which a habeas petition may not be granted unless\nthe state court\u2019s adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that\nwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\nof, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court of the United States . . . .\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1). In Mitchell v. Esparza, 540 U. S. 12 (2003)\n(per curiam), we held that, when a state court determines\nthat a constitutional violation is harmless, a federal court\nmay not award habeas relief under \u00a72254 unless the harm\nlessness determination itself was unreasonable. Petitioner\ncontends that \u00a72254(d)(1), as interpreted in Esparza,\neliminates the requirement that a petitioner also satisfy\nBrecht\u2019s standard. We think not. That conclusion is not\nsuggested by Esparza, which had no reason to decide the\npoint. Nor is it suggested by the text of AEDPA, which\nsets forth a precondition to the grant of habeas relief (\u201ca\nwrit of habeas corpus . . . shall not be granted\u201d unless the\nconditions of \u00a72254(d) are met), not an entitlement to it.\n                    Cite as: 551 U.

Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000), it is implau\nsible that, without saying so, AEDPA replaced the Brecht\nstandard of \u201c \u2018actual prejudice,\u2019 \u201d 507 U. S., at 637 (quoting\nUnited States v. Lane, 474 U. S. 438, 449 (1986)), with the\nmore liberal AEDPA/Chapman standard which requires\nonly that the state court\u2019s harmless-beyond-a-reasonable\ndoubt determination be unreasonable. That said, it cer\ntainly makes no sense to require formal application of both\ntests (AEDPA/Chapman and Brecht) when the latter\nobviously subsumes the former. Accordingly, the Ninth\nCircuit was correct to apply the Brecht standard of review\nin assessing the prejudicial impact of federal constitu\ntional error in a state-court criminal trial.2\n                              B\n   Petitioner argues that, even if Brecht provides the stan\ndard of review, we must still reverse the judgment below\nbecause the exclusion of Maples\u2019 testimony substantially\nand injuriously affected the jury\u2019s verdict in this case.\nThat argument, however, is not fairly encompassed within\nthe question presented. We granted certiorari to decide a\nquestion that has divided the Courts of Appeals\u2014whether\nBrecht or Chapman provides the appropriate standard of\nreview when constitutional error in a state-court trial is\nfirst recognized by a federal court. Compare, e.g., Bains v.\nCambra, 204 F. 3d 964, 976\u2013977 (CA9 2000), with Orn\ndorff v. Lockhart, 998 F. 2d 1426, 1429\u20131430 (CA8 1993).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 We  do not agree with petitioner\u2019s amicus that Brecht\u2019s concerns\nregarding the finality of state-court criminal judgments and the diffi\nculty of retrying a defendant years after the crime \u201chave been largely\nalleviated by [AEDPA],\u201d which \u201csets strict time limitations on habeas\npetitions and limits second or successive petitions as well.\u201d Brief for\nInnocence Network 7. Even cases governed by AEDPA can span a\ndecade, as the nearly 12-year gap between petitioner\u2019s conviction and\nthe issuance of this decision illustrates.\n8                             FRY v. PLILER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nIt is true that the second sentence of the question pre\nsented asks: \u201cDoes it matter which harmless error stan\ndard is employed?\u201d Pet. for Cert. I. But to ask whether\nBrecht makes any real difference is not to ask whether the\nNinth Circuit misapplied Brecht in this particular case.\nPetitioner seems to have understood this. Only in a brief\nfootnote of his petition did he hint that the Ninth Circuit\nerred in its application of the Brecht standard. Pet. for\nCert. 23, n. 19.3 Indeed, if application of the Brecht stan\ndard to the facts of this case were encompassed within the\nquestion presented, so too would be the question of\nwhether there was constitutional error in the first place.\nAfter all, it would not \u201cmatter which harmless error stan\ndard is employed\u201d if there were no underlying constitu\ntional error. Unlike the dissenting JUSTICES, some of\nwhom would reverse the decision below on the ground that\nthe error was harmful under Brecht, and one of whom\nwould vacate the decision below on the ground that it is\nunclear whether there was constitutional error in the first\ninstance, we read the question presented to avoid these\ntangential and factbound questions, and limit our review\nto the question of whether Chapman or Brecht provides\nthe governing standard.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Thequestion presented included one additional issue: \u201c[I]f the\nBrecht standard applies, does the petitioner or the State bear the\nburden of persuasion on the question of prejudice?\u201d Pet. for Cert. I. We\nhave previously held that, when a court is \u201cin virtual equipoise as to\nthe harmlessness of the error\u201d under the Brecht standard, the court\nshould \u201ctreat the error . . . as if it affected the verdict . . . .\u201d O\u2019Neal v.\nMcAninch, 513 U. S. 432, 435 (1995). The majority opinion below did\nnot refer to O\u2019Neal, presumably because the majority harbored no grave\ndoubt as to the harmlessness of the error. Neither did the dissenting\njudge refer to O\u2019Neal, presumably because she did not think the major\nity harbored grave doubt as to the harmlessness of the error. Moreover,\nthe State has conceded throughout this \u00a72254 proceeding that it bears\nthe burden of persuasion. Thus, there is no basis on which to conclude\nthat the court below ignored O\u2019Neal.\n                  Cite as: 551 U.

CHERYL\n              K. PLILER, WARDEN\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [June 11, 2007] \n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER and\nJUSTICE GINSBURG join, and with whom JUSTICE BREYER\njoins in part, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n   While I join all of the Court\u2019s opinion except Part II\u2013B, I\nam persuaded that we should also answer the question\nwhether the constitutional error was harmless under the\nstandard announced in Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S.\n619 (1993). The parties and the Solicitor General as\namicus curiae fully briefed and argued the question, pre\nsumably because it appears to fit within the awkwardly\ndrafted question that we agreed to review.1 Moreover, our\nanswer to the question whether the error was harmless\nwould emphasize the important point that the Brecht\nstandard, as more fully explained in our opinion in Kot\nteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750 (1946), imposes a\nsignificant burden of persuasion on the State.\n   Both the history of this litigation and the nature of the\nconstitutional error involved provide powerful support for\nthe conclusion that if the jurors had heard the testimony\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In Brecht itself the application of the standard of Kotteakos v.\n\nUnited States, 328 U. S. 750 (1946), to the facts of the case was not even\narguably encompassed within the question presented. We nonetheless\nfound it appropriate to rule on whether the error was harmless under\nthat standard. See Brecht, 507 U. S., at 638 (\u201cAll that remains to be\ndecided is whether petitioner is entitled to relief\u201d).\n2                           FRY v. PLILER\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nof Pamela Maples, they would at least have had a reason\nable doubt concerning petitioner\u2019s guilt. Petitioner was\nnot found guilty until after he had been tried three times.\nThe first trial ended in a mistrial with the jury deadlocked\n6 to 6. App. 121. The second trial also resulted in a mis\ntrial due to a deadlocked jury, this time 7 to 5 in favor of\nconviction. Ibid. In the third trial, after the jurors had\nbeen deliberating for 11 days, the foreperson advised the\njudge that they were split 7 to 5 and \u201c \u2018hopelessly dead\nlocked.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 74\u201375. When the judge instructed the\njury to continue its deliberations, the foreperson requested\nclarification on the definition of \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at\n75. The jury deliberated for an additional 23 days after\nthat exchange\u2014a total of five weeks\u2014before finally return\ning a guilty verdict.2\n   It is not surprising that some jurors harbored a reason\nable doubt as to petitioner\u2019s guilt weeks into their delib\nerations. The only person to offer eyewitness testimony, a\ndisinterested truckdriver, described the killer as a man\nwho was 5\u20197\u201d to 5\u20198\u201d tall, weighed about 140 pounds, and\nhad a full head of hair. Tr. 4574 (Apr. 26, 1995). Peti\ntioner is 6\u20192\u201d tall, weighed 300 pounds at the time of the\nmurder, and is bald. Record, Doc. No. 13, Exh. L (arrest\nreport); Ibid., Exh. M (petitioner\u2019s driver\u2019s license). Seven\ndifferent witnesses linked the killings to a man named\nAnthony Hurtz, some testifying that Hurtz had admitted\nto them that he was in fact the killer. App. 60\u201364, 179.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 According to data compiled by the National Center for State Courts,\n\nthe average length of jury deliberations for a capital murder trial\nin California is 12 hours. See Judge and Attorney Survey (California),\nState of the States\u2014Survey of Jury Improvement Efforts (2007), online\nat     http://www.ncsconline.org/D_research/cjs/xls/SOSJAData/CA_JA_\nState.xls (as visited June 8, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile). Three days before the jury reached a verdict in this noncapital\ncase, the trial judge speculated that it was perhaps the longest delib\neration in the history of Solano County. Tr. 5315 (June 5, 1995).\n                    Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nEach of those witnesses, unlike the truckdriver, was im\npeached by evidence of bias, either against Hurtz or for\npetitioner. Id., at 61\u201364, 73, 179\u2013180.\n   However, Pamela Maples, a cousin of Hurtz\u2019s who was\nin all other respects a disinterested witness, did not testify\nat either of petitioner\u2019s first two trials. During the third\ntrial, she testified out of the presence of the jury that she\nhad overheard statements by Hurtz that he had commit\nted a double murder strikingly similar to that witnessed\nby the truckdriver. As the Magistrate Judge found, the\nexclusion of Maples\u2019 testimony for lack of foundation was\nclear constitutional error under Chambers v. Mississippi,\n410 U. S. 284 (1973), and the State does not argue other\nwise.3 Cf. Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 8 (1986)\n(\u201cThe testimony of more disinterested witnesses . . . would\nquite naturally be given much greater weight by the\njury\u201d).\n   Chambers error is by nature prejudicial. We have said\nthat Chambers \u201cdoes not stand for the proposition that the\ndefendant is denied a fair opportunity to defend himself\nwhenever a state or federal rule excludes favorable evi\ndence.\u201d United States v. Scheffer, 523 U. S. 303, 316\n(1998). Rather, due process considerations hold sway over\nstate evidentiary rules only when the exclusion of evidence\n\u201cundermine[s] fundamental elements of the defendant\u2019s\ndefense.\u201d Id., at 315. Hence, as a matter of law and logi\ncal inference, it is well-nigh impossible for a reviewing\ncourt to conclude that such error \u201cdid not influence the\njury, or had but very slight effect\u201d on its verdict. Kot\nteakos, 328 U. S., at 764; see also O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, 513\nU. S. 432, 445 (1995) (\u201c[W]hen a habeas court is in grave\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 As the Magistrate Judge remarked, \u201c[j]ust how many double execu\ntion style homicides involving a female driver shot in the head and a\nmale passenger also shot in a parked car could there be in a community\nproximate to the victims\u2019 murder herein?\u201d App. 179.\n4                           FRY v. PLILER\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ndoubt as to the harmlessness of an error that affects sub\nstantial rights, it should grant relief\u201d).\n   It is difficult to imagine a less appropriate case for an\nexception to that commonsense proposition. We found in\nParker v. Gladden, 385 U. S. 363 (1966) (per curiam), that\n26 hours of juror deliberations in a murder trial \u201cindi\ncat[ed] a difference among them as to the guilt of peti\ntioner.\u201d Id., at 365. Here, the jury was deprived of signifi\ncant evidence of third-party guilt, and still we measure the\nlength of deliberations by weeks, not hours. In light of the\njurors\u2019 evident uncertainty, the prospect of rebutting the\nnear-conclusive presumption that the Chambers error did\nsubstantial harm vanishes completely.4\n   We have not been shy in emphasizing that federal ha\nbeas courts do not lightly find constitutional error. See\nCarey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. ___ (2006). It follows that\nwhen they do find an error, they may not lightly discount\nits significance. Rather, a harmlessness finding requires\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See United States v.

Abrahamson, 507\nU. S. 619 (1993), sets forth the proper standard of review.\nCf. id., at 643 (STEVENS, J., concurring). At the same\ntime, I agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that we should con\nsider the application of the standard, that the error was\nnot harmless, and that \u201cChambers error is by nature\nprejudicial.\u201d Ante, at 3 (opinion concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (citing Chambers v. Mississippi, 410\nU. S. 284 (1973)). Cf. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419,\n435 (1995) (similar statement as to errors under\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963)). Nonetheless, I\nwould remand this case rather than reversing the Court of\nAppeals.\n   My reason arises out of the fact that here, for purposes\nof deciding whether Chambers error exists, the question of\nharm is inextricably tied to other aspects of the trial\ncourt\u2019s determination. The underlying evidentiary judg\nment at issue involved a weighing of the probative value of\nproffered evidence against, e.g., its cumulative nature, its\ntendency to confuse or to prejudice the jury, or the likeli\nhood that it will simply waste the jury\u2019s time. See App.\n96\u201397; Cal. Evid. Code Ann. \u00a7352 (West 1995); cf. Fed.\nRule Evid. 403. In this context, to find a Chambers error a\n2                      FRY v. PLILER\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ncourt must take account both of the way in which (and\nextent to which) the trial court misweighed the relevant\nadmissibility factors and of the extent to which doing so\nharmed the defendant. Moreover, to find this kind of error\nharmless, as the Court of Appeals found it, should pre\nclude the possibility of a Chambers error; but to find this\nkind of error harmful does not guarantee the contrary. A\ngarden-variety nonharmless misapplication of evidentiary\nprinciples normally will not rise to the level of a constitu\ntional, Chambers, mistake. Cf., e.g., United States v. Schef\nfer, 523 U. S. 303, 308 (1998).\n   All this, it seems to me, requires reconsideration by\nthe Court of Appeals of its Chambers determination. I\nwould not consider the question whether that exclusion of\nevidence amounted to Chambers error because that ques\ntion is not before us, see ante, at 3, n. 1 (opinion of the\nCourt). But the logically inseparable question of harm is\nbefore us; and that, I believe, is sufficient.\n   I would remand the case to the Ninth Circuit so that,\ntaking account of the points JUSTICE STEVENS raises, ante,\nat 1\u20134, it can reconsider whether there was an error of\nadmissibility sufficiently serious to violate Chambers. I\ntherefore join the Court\u2019s opinion except as to footnote 1\nand Part II\u2013B, and I join JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion in\npart.\n",

At trial, petitioner sought to attribute the murders to one or more other persons. To that end, he offered testimony of several witnesses who linked one Anthony Hurtz to the killings. But the trial court excluded the testimony of one additional witness, Pamela Maples, who was prepared to testify that she had heard Hurtz discussing homicides bearing some resemblance to the murder of the Bells. In the trial court's view, the defense had provided insufficient evidence to link the incidents described by Hurtz to the murders for which petitioner was charged.</p>\n<p>Following his conviction, petitioner appealed to the California Court of Appeal, arguing (among other things) that the trial court's exclusion of Maples' testimony deprived him of a fair opportunity to defend himself, in violation of <i>Chambers v.

He found the state appellate court's failure to recognize error under <i>Chambers</i> to be \"an unreasonable application of clearly established law as set forth by the Supreme Court,\" App. 180, and disagreed with the state appellate court's finding of \"no possible prejudice.\" But he nevertheless concluded that \"there ha[d] been an insufficient showing that the improper exclusion of the testimony of Ms. Maples had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury's verdict\" under the standard set forth in <i>Brecht.</i> App. 181-182. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's findings and recommendations in full, and a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. We granted certiorari. 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 763, 166 L.Ed.2d 590 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2325</span> II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In <i>Chapman, supra,</i> a case that reached this Court <i>on direct review</i> of a state-court criminal judgment, we held that a federal constitutional error can be considered harmless only if a court is \"able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 24, 87 S.Ct. 824. In <i>Brecht, supra,</i> we considered whether the <i>Chapman</i> standard of review applies <i>on collateral review</i> of a state-court criminal judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Citing concerns about finality, comity, and federalism, we rejected the <i>Chapman</i> standard in favor of the more forgiving standard of review applied to nonconstitutional errors on direct appeal from federal convictions. See <i>Kotteakos v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104321\"><a href=\"/opinion/104321/kotteakos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). Under that standard, an error is harmless unless it \"`had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.'\" <i>Brecht, supra,</i> at 631, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (quoting <i>Kotteakos, supra,</i> at 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239). The question in this case is whether a federal court must assess the prejudicial impact of the unconstitutional exclusion of evidence during a state-court criminal trial under <i>Brecht</i> even if the state appellate court has not found, as the state appellate court in <i>Brecht</i> had found, that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <i>Chapman.</i><sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>We begin with the Court's opinion in <i>Brecht.</i> The primary reasons it gave for adopting a less onerous standard on collateral review of state-court criminal judgments did not turn on whether the state court itself conducted <i>Chapman</i> review. The opinion explained that application of <i>Chapman</i> would \"undermin[e] the States' interest in finality,\" 507 U.S., at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710; would \"infring[e] upon [the States'] sovereignty over criminal matters,\" <i>ibid.;</i> would undercut the historic limitation of habeas relief to those \"`grievously wronged,'\" <i>ibid.;</i> and would \"impos[e] significant `societal costs,'\" <i>ibid.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Mechanik,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111598\"><a href=\"/opinion/111598/united-states-v-mechanik/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 72, 106 S.Ct. 938, 89 L.Ed.2d 50 (1986)). Since each of these concerns applies with equal force whether or not the state court reaches the <i>Chapman</i> question, it would be illogical to make the standard of review turn upon that contingency.</p>\n<p>The opinion in <i>Brecht</i> clearly assumed that the <i>Kotteakos</i> standard would apply in virtually all \u00a7 2254 cases. It suggested an exception only for the \"unusual case\" in which \"a deliberate and especially egregious error of the trial type, or one that is combined with a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct ... infect[s] the integrity of the proceeding.\" 507 U.S., at 638, n. 9, 113 S.Ct. 1710. This, of course, has nothing to do with whether the state court conducted harmless-error review. The concurring and dissenting opinions shared the assumption that <i>Kotteakos</i> would almost always be the standard on collateral review. The former stated in categorical terms that the \"<i>Kotteakos</i> standard\" \"will now apply on collateral review\" of state convictions, 507 U.S., at 643, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (STEVENS, J., concurring). Justice White's dissent complained that under the Court's opinion <i>Kotteakos</i> would apply even where (as in this case) the state court found that \"no violation had occurred,\" 507 U.S., at 644, 113 S.Ct. 1710; and Justice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2326</span> O'Connor's dissent stated that <i>Chapman</i> would \"no longer appl[y] to <i>any</i> trial error asserted on habeas,\" 507 U.S., at 651, 113 S.Ct. 1710. Later cases also assumed that <i>Brecht's</i> applicability does not turn on whether the state appellate court recognized the constitutional error and reached the <i>Chapman</i> question. See <i>Penry v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118438\"><a href=\"/opinion/118438/penry-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span>, 795, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001); <i>Calderon v. Coleman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1639091\"><a href=\"/opinion/1639091/calderon-v-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 145, 119 S.Ct. 500, 142 L.Ed.2d 521 (1998) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>Petitioner's contrary position misreads (or at least exaggerates the significance of) a lone passage from our <i>Brecht</i> opinion. In that passage, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"State courts are fully qualified to identify constitutional error and evaluate its prejudicial effect on the trial process under <i>Chapman,</i> and state courts often occupy a superior vantage point from which to evaluate the effect of trial error. For these reasons, it scarcely seems logical to require federal habeas courts to engage in the identical approach to harmless-error review that <i>Chapman</i> requires state courts to engage in on direct review.\" 507 U.S., at 636, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>But the quoted passage does little to advance petitioner's position. To say (a) that since state courts are <i>required</i> to evaluate constitutional error under <i>Chapman</i> it makes no sense to establish <i>Chapman</i> as the standard for federal habeas review is not at all to say (b) that whenever a state court fails in its responsibility to apply <i>Chapman</i> the federal habeas standard must change. It would be foolish to equate the two, in view of the other weighty reasons given in <i>Brecht</i> for applying a less onerous standard on collateral review\u0097reasons having nothing to do with whether the state court actually applied <i>Chapman.</i></p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that, if <i>Brecht</i> applies whether or not the state appellate court conducted <i>Chapman</i> review, then <i>Brecht</i> would apply even if a State <i>eliminated appellate review altogether.</i> That is not necessarily so. The federal habeas review rule applied to the class of case in which state appellate review is available does not have to be the same rule applied to the class of case where it is not. We have no occasion to resolve that hypothetical (and highly unrealistic) question now. In the case before us petitioner <i>did</i> obtain appellate review of his constitutional claim; the state court simply found the underlying claim weak and therefore did not measure its prejudicial impact under <i>Chapman.</i> The attempted analogy\u0097between (1) eliminating appellate review altogether and (2) providing appellate review but rejecting a constitutional claim without assessing its prejudicial impact under <i>Chapman</i>\u0097is a false one.</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends that, even if <i>Brecht</i> adopted a categorical rule, post-<i>Brecht</i> developments require a different standard of review. Three years after we decided <i>Brecht,</i> Congress passed, and the President signed, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), under which a habeas petition may not be granted unless the state court's adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States ....\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). In <i>Mitchell v. Esparza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131144\"><a href=\"/opinion/131144/mitchell-v-esparza/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 7, 157 L.Ed.2d 263 (2003) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> we held that, when a state court determines that a constitutional violation is harmless, a federal court may not award habeas relief under \u00a7 2254 unless <i>the harmlessness determination itself</i> was unreasonable. Petitioner contends that \u00a7 2254(d)(1), as interpreted in <i>Esparza,</i> eliminates the requirement that a petitioner also satisfy <i>Brecht's</i> standard. We think not. That conclusion is not suggested by <i>Esparza,</i> which had no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2327</span> reason to decide the point. Nor is it suggested by the text of AEDPA, which sets forth a precondition to the grant of habeas relief (\"a writ of habeas corpus ... shall not be granted\" unless the conditions of \u00a7 2254(d) are met), not an entitlement to it. Given our frequent recognition that AEDPA limited rather than expanded the availability of habeas relief, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), it is implausible that, without saying so, AEDPA replaced the <i>Brecht</i> standard of \"`actual prejudice,'\" 507 U.S., at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (quoting <i>United States v. Lane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111560\"><a href=\"/opinion/111560/united-states-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span>, 449, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986)), with the more liberal AEDPA/<i>Chapman</i> standard which requires only that the state court's harmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt determination be unreasonable. That said, it certainly makes no sense to require formal application of <i>both</i> tests (AEDPA/<i>Chapman</i> and <i>Brecht</i>) when the latter obviously subsumes the former. Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit was correct to apply the <i>Brecht</i> standard of review in assessing the prejudicial impact of federal constitutional error in a state-court criminal trial.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioner argues that, even if <i>Brecht</i> provides the standard of review, we must still reverse the judgment below because the exclusion of Maples' testimony substantially and injuriously affected the jury's verdict in this case. That argument, however, is not fairly encompassed within the question presented. We granted certiorari to decide a question that has divided the Courts of Appeals\u0097whether <i>Brecht</i> or <i>Chapman</i> provides the appropriate standard of review when constitutional error in a state-court trial is first recognized by a federal court. Compare, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bains v. Cambra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767804\"><a href=\"/opinion/767804/surinder-bains-v-gomez-director-steve-cambra-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">964</span></a></span>, 976-977 (C.A.9 2000), with <i>Orndorff v. Lockhart,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1426</span></span>, 1429-1430 (C.A.8 1993). It is true that the second sentence of the question presented asks: \"Does it matter which harmless error standard is employed?\" Pet. for Cert. I. But to ask whether <i>Brecht</i> makes any real difference is not to ask whether the Ninth Circuit misapplied <i>Brecht</i> in this particular case. Petitioner seems to have understood this. Only in a brief footnote of his petition did he hint that the Ninth Circuit erred in its application of the <i>Brecht</i> standard. Pet. for Cert. 23, n. 19.<sup>[3]</sup> Indeed, if application of the <i>Brecht</i> standard to the facts of this case were encompassed within the question presented, so too would be the question of whether there was constitutional error in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2328</span> the first place. After all, it would not \"matter which harmless error standard is employed\" if there were no underlying constitutional error. Unlike the dissenting JUSTICES, some of whom would reverse the decision below on the ground that the error was harmful under <i>Brecht,</i> and one of whom would vacate the decision below on the ground that it is unclear whether there was constitutional error in the first instance, we read the question presented to avoid these tangential and factbound questions, and limit our review to the question of whether <i>Chapman</i> or <i>Brecht</i> provides the governing standard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We hold that in \u00a7 2254 proceedings a court must assess the prejudicial impact of constitutional error in a state-court criminal trial under the \"substantial and injurious effect\" standard set forth in <i>Brecht,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112845\"><a href=\"/opinion/112845/brecht-v-abrahamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353, whether or not the state appellate court recognized the error and reviewed it for harmlessness under the \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard set forth in <i>Chapman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705. Since the Ninth Circuit correctly applied the <i>Brecht</i> standard rather than the <i>Chapman</i> standard, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice SOUTER and Justice GINSBURG join, and with whom Justice BREYER joins in part, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>While I join all of the Court's opinion except Part II-B, I am persuaded that we should also answer the question whether the constitutional error was harmless under the standard announced in <i>Brecht v. Abrahamson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112845\"><a href=\"/opinion/112845/brecht-v-abrahamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). The parties and the Solicitor General as <i>amicus curiae</i> fully briefed and argued the question, presumably because it appears to fit within the awkwardly drafted question that we agreed to review.<sup>[1]</sup> Moreover, our answer to the question whether the error was harmless would emphasize the important point that the <i>Brecht</i> standard, as more fully explained in our opinion in <i>Kotteakos v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104321\"><a href=\"/opinion/104321/kotteakos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), imposes a significant burden of persuasion on the State.</p>\n<p>Both the history of this litigation and the nature of the constitutional error involved provide powerful support for the conclusion that if the jurors had heard the testimony of Pamela Maples, they would at least have had a reasonable doubt concerning petitioner's guilt. Petitioner was not found guilty until after he had been tried three times. The first trial ended in a mistrial with the jury deadlocked 6 to 6. App. 121. The second trial also resulted in a mistrial due to a deadlocked jury, this time 7 to 5 in favor of conviction. <i>Ibid.</i> In the third trial, after the jurors had been deliberating for 11 days, the foreperson advised the judge that they were split 7 to 5 and \"`hopelessly deadlocked.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 74-75. When the judge instructed the jury to continue its deliberations, the foreperson requested clarification on the definition of \"reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 75. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2329</span> The jury deliberated for an additional 23 days after that exchange\u0097a total of <i>five weeks</i>\u0097before finally returning a guilty verdict.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>It is not surprising that some jurors harbored a reasonable doubt as to petitioner's guilt weeks into their deliberations. The only person to offer eyewitness testimony, a disinterested truckdriver, described the killer as a man who was 5'7\" to 5'8\" tall, weighed about 140 pounds, and had a full head of hair. Tr. 4574 (Apr. 26, 1995). Petitioner is 6'2\" tall, weighed 300 pounds at the time of the murder, and is bald. Record, Doc. No. 13, Exh. L (arrest report); <i>Ibid.,</i> Exh. M (petitioner's driver's license). Seven different witnesses linked the killings to a man named Anthony Hurtz, some testifying that Hurtz had admitted to them that he was in fact the killer. App. 60-64, 179. Each of those witnesses, unlike the truckdriver, was impeached by evidence of bias, either against Hurtz or for petitioner. <i>Id.,</i> at 61-64, 73, 179-180.</p>\n<p>However, Pamela Maples, a cousin of Hurtz's who was in all other respects a disinterested witness, did not testify at either of petitioner's first two trials. During the third trial, she testified out of the presence of the jury that she had overheard statements by Hurtz that he had committed a double murder strikingly similar to that witnessed by the truckdriver. As the Magistrate Judge found, the exclusion of Maples' testimony for lack of foundation was clear constitutional error under <i>Chambers v. Mississippi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108718\"><a href=\"/opinion/108718/chambers-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973), and the State does not argue otherwise.<sup>[3]</sup> Cf. <i>Skipper v. South Carolina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111657\"><a href=\"/opinion/111657/skipper-v-south-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (\"The testimony of more disinterested witnesses ... would quite naturally be given much greater weight by the jury\").</p>\n<p><i>Chambers</i> error is by nature prejudicial. We have said that <i>Chambers</i> \"does not stand for the proposition that the defendant is denied a fair opportunity to defend himself whenever a state or federal rule excludes favorable evidence.\" <i>United States v. Scheffer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118191\"><a href=\"/opinion/118191/united-states-v-scheffer/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 316, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). Rather, due process considerations hold sway over state evidentiary rules only when the exclusion of evidence \"undermine[s] fundamental elements of the defendant's defense.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 315, 118 S.Ct. 1261. Hence, as a matter of law and logical inference, it is well-nigh impossible for a reviewing court to conclude that such error \"did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect\" on its verdict. <i>Kotteakos,</i> 328 U.S., at 764, 66 S.Ct. 1239; see also <i>O'Neal v. McAninch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117897\"><a href=\"/opinion/117897/oneal-v-mcaninch/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 445, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995) (\"[W]hen a habeas court is in grave doubt as to the harmlessness of an error that affects substantial rights, it should grant relief\").</p>\n<p>It is difficult to imagine a less appropriate case for an exception to that commonsense proposition. We found in <i>Parker v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2330</span> <i>Gladden,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107322\"><a href=\"/opinion/107322/parker-v-gladden/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span>, 87 S.Ct. 468, 17 L.Ed.2d 420 (1966) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> that 26 hours of juror deliberations in a murder trial \"indicat[ed] a difference among them as to the guilt of petitioner.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 365, 87 S.Ct. 468. Here, the jury was deprived of significant evidence of third-party guilt, and still we measure the length of deliberations by weeks, not hours. In light of the jurors' evident uncertainty, the prospect of rebutting the near-conclusive presumption that the <i>Chambers</i> error did substantial harm vanishes completely.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>We have not been shy in emphasizing that federal habeas courts do not lightly find constitutional error. See <i>Carey v. Musladin,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 649, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006). It follows that when they do find an error, they may not lightly discount its significance. Rather, a harmlessness finding requires \"fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\" <i>Kotteakos,</i> 328 U.S., at 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239. Given \"all that happened\" in this case, and given the nature of the error, I cannot agree with the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the erroneous exclusion of Maples' testimony was harmless under that standard.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that <i>Brecht v. Abrahamson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112845\"><a href=\"/opinion/112845/brecht-v-abrahamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993), sets forth the proper standard of review. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 643, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (STEVENS, J., concurring). At the same time, I agree with Justice STEVENS that we should consider the application of the standard, that the error was not harmless, and that \"<i>Chambers</i> error is by nature prejudicial.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2329 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing <i>Chambers v. Mississippi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108718\"><a href=\"/opinion/108718/chambers-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973)). Cf. <i>Kyles v.

Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, (1963)). Nonetheless, I would remand this case rather than reversing the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>My reason arises out of the fact that here, for purposes of deciding whether <i>Chambers</i> error exists, the question of harm is inextricably tied to other aspects of the trial court's determination. The underlying evidentiary judgment at issue involved a weighing of the probative value <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2331</span> of proffered evidence against, <i>e.g.,</i> its cumulative nature, its tendency to confuse or to prejudice the jury, or the likelihood that it will simply waste the jury's time. See App. 96-97; Cal. Evid.Code Ann. \u00a7 352 (West 1995); cf. Fed. Rule Evid. 403. In this context, to find a <i>Chambers</i> error a court must take account <i>both</i> of the way in which (and extent to which) the trial court misweighed the relevant admissibility factors <i>and</i> of the extent to which doing so harmed the defendant. Moreover, to find this kind of error harmless, as the Court of Appeals found it, should preclude the possibility of a <i>Chambers</i> error; but to find this kind of error harmful does not guarantee the contrary. A garden-variety non-harmless misapplication of evidentiary principles normally will not rise to the level of a constitutional, <i>Chambers,</i> mistake. Cf., <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Scheffer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118191\"><a href=\"/opinion/118191/united-states-v-scheffer/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998).</p>\n<p>All this, it seems to me, requires reconsideration by the Court of Appeals of its <i>Chambers</i> determination. I would not consider the question whether that exclusion of evidence amounted to <i>Chambers</i> error because that question is not before us, see <i>ante,</i> at 2325, n. 1 (opinion of the Court). But the logically inseparable question of harm is before us; and that, I believe, is sufficient.</p>\n<p>I would remand the case to the Ninth Circuit so that, taking account of the points Justice STEVENS raises, <i>ante,</i> at 2328-2330, it can reconsider whether there was an error of admissibility sufficiently serious to violate <i>Chambers.</i> I therefore join the Court's opinion except as to footnote 1 and Part II-B, and I join Justice STEVENS' opinion in part.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  As this case comes to the Court, we assume (without deciding) that the state appellate court's decision affirming the exclusion of Maples' testimony was an unreasonable application of <i>Chambers v. Mississippi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108718\"><a href=\"/opinion/108718/chambers-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973). We also assume that the state appellate court did not determine the harmlessness of the error under the <i>Chapman</i> standard, notwithstanding its ambiguous conclusion that the exclusion of Maples' testimony resulted in \"no possible prejudice.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  We do not agree with petitioner's <i>amicus</i> that <i>Brecht's</i> concerns regarding the finality of state-court criminal judgments and the difficulty of retrying a defendant years after the crime \"have been largely alleviated by [AEDPA],\" which \"sets strict time limitations on habeas petitions and limits second or successive petitions as well.\" Brief for Innocence Network 7. Even cases governed by AEDPA can span a decade, as the nearly 12-year gap between petitioner's conviction and the issuance of this decision illustrates.</p>\n<p>[3]  The question presented included one additional issue: \"[I]f the <i>Brecht</i> standard applies, does the petitioner or the State bear the burden of persuasion on the question of prejudice?\" Pet. for Cert. I. We have previously held that, when a court is \"in virtual equipoise as to the harmlessness of the error\" under the <i>Brecht</i> standard, the court should \"treat the error ... as if it affected the verdict....\" <i>O'Neal v. McAninch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117897\"><a href=\"/opinion/117897/oneal-v-mcaninch/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 435, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995). The majority opinion below did not refer to <i>O'Neal,</i> presumably because the majority harbored no grave doubt as to the harmlessness of the error. Neither did the dissenting judge refer to <i>O'Neal,</i> presumably because she did not think the majority harbored grave doubt as to the harmlessness of the error. Moreover, the State has conceded throughout this \u00a7 2254 proceeding that it bears the burden of persuasion. Thus, there is no basis on which to conclude that the court below ignored <i>O'Neal.</i></p>\n<p>[1]  In <i>Brecht</i> itself the application of the standard of <i>Kotteakos v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104321\"><a href=\"/opinion/104321/kotteakos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), to the facts of the case was not even arguably encompassed within the question presented. We nonetheless found it appropriate to rule on whether the error was harmless under that standard. See <i>Brecht,</i> 507 U.S., at 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (\"All that remains to be decided is whether petitioner is entitled to relief\").</p>\n<p>[2]  According to data compiled by the National Center for State Courts, the average length of jury deliberations for a <i>capital</i> murder trial in California is 12 <i>hours.</i> See Judge and Attorney Survey (California), State of the States\u0097 Survey of Jury Improvement Efforts (2007), online at http://www.ncsconline.org/D_ research/cjs/xls/SOSJAData/CA_JA_ State.xls (as visited June 8, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Three days before the jury reached a verdict in this noncapital case, the trial judge speculated that it was perhaps the longest deliberation in the history of Solano County.
