Anyone who \"willfully fails\" to provide notice is civilly liable to the consumer. \u00a7 1681n(a). The questions in these consolidated cases are whether willful failure covers a violation committed in reckless disregard of the notice obligation, and, if so, whether petitioners Safeco and GEICO committed reckless violations. We hold that reckless action is covered, that GEICO did not violate the statute, and that while Safeco might have, it did not act recklessly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Congress enacted FCRA in 1970 to ensure fair and accurate credit reporting, promote efficiency in the banking system, and protect consumer privacy. See 84 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2206</span> Stat. 1128, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681; <i>TRW Inc. v. Andrews,</i> 534 U.S. 19, 23, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001). The Act requires, among other things, that \"any person [who] takes any adverse action with respect to any consumer that is based in whole or in part on any information contained in a consumer report\" must notify the affected consumer.<sup>[1]</sup> 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(a). The notice must point out the adverse action, explain how to reach the agency that reported on the consumer's credit, and tell the consumer that he can get a free copy of the report and dispute its accuracy with the agency. <i>Ibid.</i> As it applies to an insurance company, \"adverse action\" is \"a denial or cancellation of, an increase in any charge for, or a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or amount of, any insurance, existing or applied for.\" \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>FCRA provides a private right of action against businesses that use consumer reports but fail to comply. If a violation is negligent, the affected consumer is entitled to actual damages. \u00a7 1681<i>o</i>(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). If willful, however, the consumer may have actual damages, or statutory damages ranging from $100 to $1,000, and even punitive damages. \u00a7 1681n(a) (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioner GEICO<sup>[2]</sup> writes auto insurance through four subsidiaries: GEICO General, which sells \"preferred\" policies at low rates to low-risk customers; Government Employees, which also sells \"preferred\" policies, but only to government employees; GEICO Indemnity, which sells standard policies to moderate-risk customers; and GEICO Casualty, which sells nonstandard policies at higher rates to high-risk customers. Potential customers call a toll-free number answered by an agent of the four affiliates, who takes information and, with permission, gets the applicant's credit score.<sup>[3]</sup> This information goes into GEICO's computer system, which selects any appropriate company and the particular rate at which a policy may be issued.</p>\n<p>For some time after FCRA went into effect, GEICO sent adverse action notices to all applicants who were not offered \"preferred\" policies from GEICO General or Government Employees. GEICO changed its practice, however, after a method to \"neutralize\" an applicant's credit score was devised: the applicant's company and tier placement is compared with the company and tier placement he would have been assigned with a \"neutral\" credit score, that is, one calculated without reliance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2207</span> on credit history.<sup>[4]</sup> Under this new scheme, it is only if using a neutral credit score would have put the applicant in a lower priced tier or company that GEICO sends an adverse action notice; the applicant is not otherwise told if he would have gotten better terms with a better credit score.</p>\n<p>Respondent Ajene Edo applied for auto insurance with GEICO. After obtaining Edo's credit score, GEICO offered him a standard policy with GEICO Indemnity (at rates higher than the most favorable), which he accepted. Because Edo's company and tier placement would have been the same with a neutral score, GEICO did not give Edo an adverse action notice. Edo later filed this proposed class action against GEICO, alleging willful failure to give notice in violation of \u00a7 1681m(a); he claimed no actual harm, but sought statutory and punitive damages under \u00a7 1681n(a). The District Court granted summary judgment for GEICO, finding there was no adverse action when \"the premium charged to [Edo] ... would have been the same even if GEICO Indemnity did not consider information in [his] consumer credit history.\" <i>Edo v. GEICO Casualty Co.,</i> CV 02-678-BR, 2004 WL 3639689, *4, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28522, *12 (D.Ore., Feb. 23, 2004), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-100, p. 46a.</p>\n<p>Like GEICO, petitioner Safeco<sup>[5]</sup> relies on credit reports to set initial insurance premiums,<sup>[6]</sup> as it did for respondents Charles Burr and Shannon Massey, who were offered higher rates than the best rates possible. Safeco sent them no adverse action notices, and they later joined a proposed class action against the company, alleging willful violation of \u00a7 1681m(a) and seeking statutory and punitive damages under \u00a7 1681n(a). The District Court ordered summary judgment for Safeco, on the understanding that offering a single, initial rate for insurance cannot be \"adverse action.\"</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed both judgments. In GEICO's case, it held that whenever a consumer \"would have received a lower rate for his insurance had the information in his consumer report been more favorable, an adverse action has been taken against him.\" <i>Reynolds v. Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc.,</i> 435 F.3d 1081, 1093 (2006). Since a better credit score would have placed Edo with GEICO General, not GEICO Indemnity, the appeals court held that GEICO's failure to give notice was an adverse action.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit also held that an insurer \"willfully\" fails to comply with FCRA if it acts with \"reckless disregard\" of a consumer's rights under the Act. <i>Id.,</i> at 1099. It explained that a company would not be acting recklessly if it \"diligently and in good faith attempted to fulfill its statutory obligations\" and came to a \"tenable, albeit erroneous, interpretation of the statute.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The court went on to say that \"a deliberate failure to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2208</span> the extent of its obligations\" would not ordinarily escape liability under \u00a7 1681n, any more than \"reliance on creative lawyering that provides indefensible answers.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Because the court believed that the enquiry into GEICO's reckless disregard might turn on undisclosed circumstances surrounding GEICO's revision of its notification policy, the Court of Appeals remanded the company's case for further proceedings.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In the action against Safeco, the Court of Appeals rejected the District Court's position, relying on its reasoning in GEICO's case (where it had held that the notice requirement applies to a single statement of an initial charge for a new policy). <i>Spano v. Safeco Corp.,</i> 140 Fed. Appx. 746 (2005). The Court of Appeals also rejected Safeco's argument that its conduct was not willful, again citing the GEICO case, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>We consolidated the two matters and granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the Circuits as to whether \u00a7 1681n(a) reaches reckless disregard of FCRA's obligations,<sup>[8]</sup> and to clarify the notice requirement in \u00a7 1681m(a). 548 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 36, 165 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2006). We now reverse in both cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>GEICO and Safeco argue that liability under \u00a7 1681n(a) for \"willfully fail[ing] to comply\" with FCRA goes only to acts known to violate the Act, not to reckless disregard of statutory duty, but we think they are wrong. We have said before that \"willfully\" is a \"word of many meanings whose construction is often dependent on the context in which it appears,\" <i>Bryan v. United States,</i> 524 U.S. 184, 191, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); and where willfulness is a statutory condition of civil liability, we have generally taken it to cover not only knowing violations of a standard, but reckless ones as well, see <i>McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co.,</i> 486 U.S. 128, 132-133, 108 S.Ct. 1677, 100 L.Ed.2d 115 (1988) (\"willful,\" as used in a limitation provision for actions under the Fair Labor Standards Act, covers claims of reckless violation); <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston,</i> 469 U.S. 111, 125-126, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985) (same, as to a liquidated damages provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967); cf. <i>United States v. Illinois Central R. Co.,</i> 303 U.S. 239, 242-243, 58 S.Ct. 533, 82 L.Ed. 773 (1938) (\"willfully,\" as used in a civil penalty provision, includes \"`conduct marked by careless disregard whether or not one has the right so to act'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Murdock,</i> 290 U.S. 389, 395, 54 S.Ct. 223, 78 L.Ed. 381 (1933))). This construction reflects common law usage, which treated actions in \"reckless disregard\" of the law as \"willful\" violations. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7 34, p. 212 (5th ed.1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton) (\"Although efforts have been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2209</span> made to distinguish\" the terms \"willful,\" \"wanton,\" and \"reckless,\" \"such distinctions have consistently been ignored, and the three terms have been treated as meaning the same thing, or at least as coming out at the same legal exit\"). The standard civil usage thus counsels reading the phrase \"willfully fails to comply\" in \u00a7 1681n(a) as reaching reckless FCRA violations,<sup>[9]</sup> and this is so both on the interpretive assumption that Congress knows how we construe statutes and expects us to run true to form, see <i>Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc.,</i> 508 U.S. 152, 159, 113 S.Ct. 2006, 124 L.Ed.2d 71 (1993), and under the general rule that a common law term in a statute comes with a common law meaning, absent anything pointing another way, <i>Beck v. Prupis,</i> 529 U.S. 494, 500-501, 120 S.Ct. 1608, 146 L.Ed.2d 561 (2000).</p>\n<p>GEICO and Safeco argue that Congress did point to something different in FCRA, by a drafting history of \u00a7 1681n(a) said to show that liability was supposed to attach only to knowing violations. The original version of the Senate bill that turned out as FCRA had two standards of liability to victims: grossly negligent violation (supporting actual damages) and willful violation (supporting actual, statutory, and punitive damages). S. 823, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 1 (1969). GEICO and Safeco argue that since a \"gross negligence\" standard is effectively the same as a \"reckless disregard\" standard, the original bill's \"willfulness\" standard must have meant a level of culpability higher than \"reckless disregard,\" or there would have been no requirement to show a different state of mind as a condition of the potentially much greater liability; thus, \"willfully fails to comply\" must have referred to a knowing violation. Although the gross negligence standard was reduced later in the legislative process to simple negligence (as it now appears in \u00a7 1681<i>o</i>), the provision for willful liability remains unchanged and so must require knowing action, just as it did originally in the draft of \u00a7 1681n.</p>\n<p>Perhaps. But Congress may have scaled the standard for actual damages down to simple negligence because it thought gross negligence, being like reckless action, was covered by willfulness. Because this alternative reading is possible, any inference from the drafting sequence is shaky, and certainly no match for the following clue in the text as finally adopted, which points to the traditional understanding of willfulness in the civil sphere.</p>\n<p>The phrase in question appears in the preamble sentence of \u00a7 1681n(a): \"Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2210</span> with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer ... .\" Then come the details, in paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B), spelling out two distinct measures of damages chargeable against the willful violator. As a general matter, the consumer may get either actual damages or \"damages of not less than $100 and not more than $1,000.\" \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(A). But where the offender is liable \"for obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose,\" the statute sets liability higher: \"actual damages ... or $1,000, whichever is greater.\" \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>If the companies were right that \"willfully\" limits liability under \u00a7 1681n(a) to knowing violations, the modifier \"knowingly\" in \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(B) would be superfluous and incongruous; it would have made no sense for Congress to condition the higher damages under \u00a7 1681n(a) on knowingly obtaining a report without a permissible purpose if the general threshold of any liability under the section were knowing misconduct. If, on the other hand, \"willfully\" covers both knowing and reckless disregard of the law, knowing violations are sensibly understood as a more serious subcategory of willful ones, and both the preamble and the subsection have distinct jobs to do. See <i>United States v. Menasche,</i> 348 U.S. 528, 538-539, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955) (\"`[G]ive effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute'\" (quoting <i>Montclair v. Ramsdell,</i> 107 U.S. 147, 152, 2 S.Ct. 391, 27 L.Ed. 431 (1883))).</p>\n<p>The companies make other textual and structural arguments for their view, but none is persuasive. Safeco thinks our reading would lead to the absurd result that one could, with reckless disregard, knowingly obtain a consumer report without a permissible purpose. But this is not so; action falling within the knowing subcategory does not simultaneously fall within the reckless alternative. Then both GEICO and Safeco argue that the reference to acting \"knowingly and willfully\" in FCRA's criminal enforcement provisions, \u00a7 1681q and \u00a7 1681r, indicates that \"willfully\" cannot include recklessness. But we are now on the criminal side of the law, where the paired modifiers are often found, see, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) (false statements to federal investigators); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1097(a) (embezzlement of student loan funds); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) (false statements in a passport application). As we said before, in the criminal law \"willfully\" typically narrows the otherwise sufficient intent, making the government prove something extra, in contrast to its civil-law usage, giving a plaintiff a choice of mental states to show in making a case for liability, see n. 9, <i>supra.</i> The vocabulary of the criminal side of FCRA is consequently beside the point in construing the civil side.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Before getting to the claims that the companies acted recklessly, we have the antecedent question whether either company violated the adverse action notice requirement at all. In both cases, respondent-plaintiffs' claims are premised on initial rates charged for new insurance policies, which are not \"adverse\" actions unless quoting or charging a first-time premium is \"an increase in any charge for... any insurance, existing or applied for.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>In Safeco's case, the District Court held that the initial rate for a new insurance policy cannot be an \"increase\" because there is no prior dealing. The phrase \"increase in any charge for ... insurance\" is readily understood to mean a change in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2211</span> treatment for an insured, which assumes a previous charge for comparison. See Webster's New International Dictionary 1260 (2d ed.1957) (defining \"increase\" as \"[a]ddition or enlargement in size, extent, quantity, number, intensity, value, substance, etc.; augmentation; growth; multiplication\"). Since the District Court understood \"increase\" to speak of change just as much as of comparative size or quantity, it reasoned that the statute's \"increase\" never touches the initial rate offer, where there is no change.</p>\n<p>The Government takes the part of the Court of Appeals in construing \"increase\" to reach a first-time rate. It says that regular usage of the term is not as narrow as the District Court thought: the point from which to measure difference can just as easily be understood without referring to prior individual dealing. The Government gives the example of a gas station owner who charges more than the posted price for gas to customers he doesn't like; it makes sense to say that the owner increases the price and that the driver pays an increased price, even if he never pulled in there for gas before. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 26.<sup>[10]</sup> The Government implies, then, that reading \"increase\" requires a choice, and the chosen reading should be the broad one in order to conform to what Congress had in mind.</p>\n<p>We think the Government's reading has the better fit with the ambitious objective set out in the Act's statement of purpose, which uses expansive terms to describe the adverse effects of unfair and inaccurate credit reporting and the responsibilities of consumer reporting agencies. See \u00a7 1681(a) (inaccurate reports \"directly impair the efficiency of the banking system\"; unfair reporting methods undermine public confidence \"essential to the continued functioning of the banking system\"; need to \"insure\" that reporting agencies \"exercise their grave responsibilities\" fairly, impartially, and with respect for privacy). The descriptions of systemic problem and systemic need as Congress saw them do nothing to suggest that remedies for consumers placed at a disadvantage by unsound credit ratings should be denied to first-time victims, and the legislative histories of FCRA's original enactment and of the 1996 amendment reveal no reason to confine attention to customers and businesses with prior dealings. Quite the contrary.<sup>[11]</sup> Finally, there is nothing about insurance contracts to suggest that Congress might have meant to differentiate applicants from existing customers when it set the notice requirement; the newly insured who gets charged more owing to an erroneous report is in the same boat with the renewal applicant.<sup>[12]</sup> We therefore <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2212</span> hold that the \"increase\" required for \"adverse action,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i), speaks to a disadvantageous rate even with no prior dealing; the term reaches initial rates for new applicants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Although offering the initial rate for new insurance can be an \"adverse action,\" respondent-plaintiffs have another hurdle to clear, for \u00a7 1681m(a) calls for notice only when the adverse action is \"based in whole or in part on\" a credit report. GEICO argues that in order to have adverse action \"based on\" a credit report, consideration of the report must be a necessary condition for the increased rate. The Government and respondent-plaintiffs do not explicitly take a position on this point.</p>\n<p>To the extent there is any disagreement on the issue, we accept GEICO's reading. In common talk, the phrase \"based on\" indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a necessary logical condition. Under this most natural reading of \u00a7 1681m(a), then, an increased rate is not \"based in whole or in part on\" the credit report unless the report was a necessary condition of the increase.</p>\n<p>As before, there are textual arguments pointing another way. The statute speaks in terms of basing the action \"in part\" as well as wholly on the credit report, and this phrasing could mean that adverse action is \"based on\" a credit report whenever the report was considered in the rate-setting process, even without being a necessary condition for the rate increase. But there are good reasons to think Congress preferred GEICO's necessary-condition reading.</p>\n<p>If the statute has any claim to lucidity, not all \"adverse actions\" require notice, only those \"based ... on\" information in a credit report. Since the statute does not explicitly call for notice when a business acts adversely merely after consulting a report, conditioning the requirement on action \"based ... on\" a report suggests that the duty to report arises from some practical consequence of reading the report, not merely some subsequent adverse occurrence that would have happened anyway. If the credit report has no identifiable effect on the rate, the consumer has no immediately practical reason to worry about it (unless he has the power to change every other fact that stands between himself and the best possible deal); both the company and the consumer are just where they would have been if the company had never seen the report.<sup>[13]</sup> And if examining reports that make no difference was supposed to trigger a reporting requirement, it would be hard to find any practical point in imposing the \"based ... on\" restriction. So it makes more sense to suspect that Congress meant to require notice and prompt a challenge by the consumer only when the consumer would gain something if the challenge succeeded.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2213</span> C</h2>\n<p>To sum up, the difference required for an increase can be understood without reference to prior dealing (allowing a first-time applicant to sue), and considering the credit report must be a necessary condition for the difference. The remaining step in determining a duty to notify in cases like these is identifying the benchmark for determining whether a first-time rate is a disadvantageous increase. And in dealing with this issue, the pragmatic reading of \"based ... on\" as a condition necessary to make a practical difference carries a helpful suggestion.</p>\n<p>The Government and respondent-plaintiffs argue that the baseline should be the rate that the applicant would have received with the best possible credit score, while GEICO contends it is what the applicant would have had if the company had not taken his credit score into account (the \"neutral score\" rate GEICO used in Edo's case). We think GEICO has the better position, primarily because its \"increase\" baseline is more comfortable with the understanding of causation just discussed, which requires notice under \u00a7 1681m(a) only when the effect of the credit report on the initial rate offered is necessary to put the consumer in a worse position than other relevant facts would have decreed anyway. If Congress was this concerned with practical consequences when it adopted a \"based ... on\" causation standard, it presumably thought in equally practical terms when it spoke of an \"increase\" that must be defined by a baseline to measure from. Congress was therefore more likely concerned with the practical question whether the consumer's rate actually suffered when the company took his credit report into account than the theoretical question whether the consumer would have gotten a better rate with perfect credit.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>The Government objects that this reading leaves a loophole, since it keeps first-time applicants who actually deserve better-than-neutral credit scores from getting notice, even when errors in credit reports saddle them with unfair rates. This is true; the neutral-score baseline will leave some consumers without a notice that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2214</span> might lead to discovering errors. But we do not know how often these cases will occur, whereas we see a more demonstrable and serious disadvantage inhering in the Government's position.</p>\n<p>Since the best rates (the Government's preferred baseline) presumably go only to a minority of consumers, adopting the Government's view would require insurers to send slews of adverse action notices; every young applicant who had yet to establish a gilt-edged credit report, for example, would get a notice that his charge had been \"increased\" based on his credit report. We think that the consequence of sending out notices on this scale would undercut the obvious policy behind the notice requirement, for notices as common as these would take on the character of formalities, and formalities tend to be ignored. It would get around that new insurance usually comes with an adverse action notice, owing to some legal quirk, and instead of piquing an applicant's interest about the accuracy of his credit record, the commonplace notices would mean just about nothing and go the way of junk mail. Assuming that Congress meant a notice of adverse action to get some attention, we think the cost of closing the loophole would be too high.</p>\n<p>While on the subject of hypernotification, we should add a word on another point of practical significance. Although the rate initially offered for new insurance is an \"increase\" calling for notice if it exceeds the neutral rate, did Congress intend the same baseline to apply if the quoted rate remains the same over a course of dealing, being repeated at each renewal date?</p>\n<p>We cannot believe so. Once a consumer has learned that his credit report led the insurer to charge more, he has no need to be told over again with each renewal if his rate has not changed. For that matter, any other construction would probably stretch the word \"increase\" more than it could bear. Once the gas station owner had charged the customer the above-market price, it would be strange to speak of the same price as an increase every time the customer pulled in. Once buyer and seller have begun a course of dealing, customary usage does demand a change for \"increase\" to make sense.<sup>[16]</sup> Thus, after initial dealing between the consumer and the insurer, the baseline for \"increase\" is the previous rate or charge, not the \"neutral\" baseline that applies at the start.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In GEICO's case, the initial rate offered to Edo was the one he would have received if his credit score had not been taken into account, and GEICO owed him no adverse action notice under \u00a7 1681m(a).<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2215</span> B</h2>\n<p>Safeco did not give Burr and Massey any notice because it thought \u00a7 1681m(a) did not apply to initial applications, a mistake that left the company in violation of the statute if Burr and Massey received higher rates \"based in whole or in part\" on their credit reports; if they did, Safeco would be liable to them on a showing of reckless conduct (or worse). The first issue we can forget, however, for although the record does not reliably indicate what rates they would have obtained if their credit reports had not been considered, it is clear enough that if Safeco did violate the statute, the company was not reckless in falling down in its duty.</p>\n<p>While \"the term recklessness is not self-defining,\" the common law has generally understood it in the sphere of civil liability as conduct violating an objective standard: action entailing \"an unjustifiably high risk of harm that is either known or so obvious that it should be known.\"<sup>[18]</sup><i>Farmer v. Brennan,</i> 511 U.S. 825, 836, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); see Prosser and Keeton \u00a7 34, at 213-214. The Restatement, for example, defines reckless disregard of a person's physical safety this way:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The actor's conduct is in reckless disregard of the safety of another if he does an act or intentionally fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do, knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize, not only that his conduct creates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another, but also that such risk is substantially greater than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 500, p. 587 (1963-1964).</blockquote>\n<p>It is this high risk of harm, objectively assessed, that is the essence of recklessness at common law. See Prosser and Keeton \u00a7 34, at 213 (recklessness requires \"a known or obvious risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow\").</p>\n<p>There being no indication that Congress had something different in mind, we have no reason to deviate from the common law understanding in applying the statute. See <i>Prupis,</i> 529 U.S., at 500-501, 120 S.Ct. 1608. Thus, a company subject to FCRA does not act in reckless disregard of it unless the action is not only a violation under a reasonable reading of the statute's terms, but shows that the company ran a risk of violating the law substantially greater than the risk associated with a reading that was merely careless.</p>\n<p>Here, there is no need to pinpoint the negligence/recklessness line, for Safeco's reading of the statute, albeit erroneous, was not objectively unreasonable. As we said, \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i) is silent on the point from which to measure \"increase.\" On the rationale that \"increase\" presupposes prior dealing, Safeco took the definition as excluding initial rate offers for new insurance, and so sent no adverse action notices to Burr and Massey. While we disagree with Safeco's analysis, we recognize <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2216</span> that its reading has a foundation in the statutory text, see <i>supra,</i> at ___ 11, and a sufficiently convincing justification to have persuaded the District Court to adopt it and rule in Safeco's favor.</p>\n<p>This is not a case in which the business subject to the Act had the benefit of guidance from the courts of appeals or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that might have warned it away from the view it took. Before these cases, no court of appeals had spoken on the issue, and no authoritative guidance has yet come from the FTC<sup>[19]</sup> (which in any case has only enforcement responsibility, not substantive rulemaking authority, for the provisions in question, see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681s(a)(1), (e)). Cf. <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (assessing, for qualified immunity purposes, whether an action was reasonable in light of legal rules that were \"clearly established\" at the time). Given this dearth of guidance and the less-than-pellucid statutory text, Safeco's reading was not objectively unreasonable, and so falls well short of raising the \"unjustifiably high risk\" of violating the statute necessary for reckless liability.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals correctly held that reckless disregard of a requirement of FCRA would qualify as a willful violation within the meaning of \u00a7 1681n(a). But there was no need for that court to remand the cases for factual development. GEICO's decision to issue no adverse action notice to Edo was not a violation of \u00a7 1681m(a), and Safeco's misreading of the statute was not reckless. The judgments of the Court of Appeals are therefore reversed in both cases, which are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>While I join the Court's judgment and Parts I, II, III-A, and IV-B of the Court's opinion, I disagree with the reasoning in Parts III-B and III-C, as well as with Part IV-A, which relies on that reasoning.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2217</span> An adverse action taken after reviewing a credit report \"is based in whole or in part on\" that report within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(a). That is true even if the company would have made the same decision without looking at the report, because what the company actually did is more relevant than what it might have done. I find nothing in the statute making the examination of a credit report a \"necessary condition\" of any resulting increase. <i>Ante,</i> at 2211. The more natural reading is that reviewing a report is only a sufficient condition.</p>\n<p>The Court's contrary position leads to a serious anomaly. As a matter of federal law, companies are free to adopt whatever \"neutral\" credit scores they want. That score need not (and probably will not) reflect the median consumer credit score. More likely, it will reflect a company's assessment of the creditworthiness of a run-of-the-mill applicant who lacks a credit report. Because those who have yet to develop a credit history are unlikely to be good credit risks, \"neutral\" credit scores will in many cases be quite low. Yet under the Court's reasoning, only those consumers with credit scores even lower than what may already be a very low \"neutral\" score will ever receive adverse action notices.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>While the Court acknowledges that \"the neutral-score baseline will leave some consumers without a notice that might lead to discovering errors,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2213-2214, it finds this unobjectionable because Congress was likely uninterested in \"the theoretical question of whether the consumer would have gotten a better rate with perfect credit.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2213.<sup>[2]</sup> The Court's decision, however, disserves not only those consumers with \"gilt-edged credit report[s],\" <i>ante,</i> at 2214, but also the much larger category of consumers with better-than-\"neutral\" scores. I find it difficult to believe that Congress could have intended for a company's unrestrained adoption of a \"neutral\" score to keep many (if not most) consumers from ever hearing that their credit reports are costing them money. In my view, the statute's text is amenable to a more sensible interpretation.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice ALITO joins, concurring in part.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court's disposition and most of its reasoning. Safeco did not send notices to new customers because it took the position that the initial insurance rate it offered a customer could not be an \"increase in any charge for ... insurance\" under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i). The Court properly holds that regardless of the merits of this interpretation, it is not an unreasonable one, and Safeco therefore did not act willfully. <i>Ante,</i> at 2214-2216. I <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2218</span> do not join Part III-A of the Court's opinion, however, because it resolves the merits of Safeco's interpretation of \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i)\u0097an issue not necessary to the Court's conclusion and not briefed or argued by the parties.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Justice SCALIA joins all but footnotes 11 and 15 of this opinion.</p>\n<p>[1]  So far as it matters here, the Act defines \"consumer report\" as \"any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, [or] credit capacity ... which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer's eligibility for ... credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d)(1) (footnote omitted). The scope of this definition is not at issue.</p>\n<p>[2]  The specific petitioners are subsidiary companies of the GEICO Corporation; for the sake of convenience, we call them \"GEICO\" collectively.</p>\n<p>[3]  The Act defines a \"credit score\" as \"a numerical value or a categorization derived from a statistical tool or modeling system used by a person who makes or arranges a loan to predict the likelihood of certain credit behaviors, including default.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681g(f)(2)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). Under its contract with its credit information providers, GEICO learned credit scores and facts in the credit reports that significantly influenced the scores, but did not have access to the credit reports themselves.</p>\n<p>[4]  A number of States permit the use of such \"neutral\" credit scores to ensure that consumers with thin or unidentifiable credit histories are not treated disadvantageously. See, <i>e.g.,</i> N.Y. Ins. Law Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2802(e), (e)(1) (West 2006) (generally prohibiting an insurer from \"consider[ing] an absence of credit information,\" but allowing it to do so if it \"treats the consumer as if the applicant or insured had neutral credit information, as defined by the insurer\").</p>\n<p>[5]  Again, the actual petitioners are subsidiary companies, of Safeco Corporation in this case; for convenience, we call them \"Safeco\" collectively.</p>\n<p>[6]  The parties do not dispute that the credit scores and credit reports relied on by GEICO and Safeco are \"consumer reports\" under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d)(1).</p>\n<p>[7]  Prior to issuing its final opinion in this case, the Court of Appeals had issued, then withdrawn, two opinions in which it held that GEICO had \"willfully\" violated FCRA as a matter of law. <i>Reynolds v. Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc.,</i> 416 F.3d 1097 (C.A.9 2005); <i>Reynolds v. Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc.,</i> 426 F.3d 1020 (C.A.9 2005).</p>\n<p>[8]  Compare, <i>e.g., </i><i>Cushman v. Trans Union Corp.,</i> 115 F.3d 220, 227 (C.A.3 1997) (adopting the \"reckless disregard\" standard), with <i>Wantz v. Experian Information Solutions,</i> 386 F.3d 829, 834 (C.A.7 2004) (construing \"willfully\" to require that a user \"knowingly and intentionally violate the Act\"); <i>Phillips v. Grendahl,</i> 312 F.3d 357, 368 (C.A.8 2002) (same).</p>\n<p>[9]  It is different in the criminal law. When the term \"willful\" or \"willfully\" has been used in a criminal statute, we have regularly read the modifier as limiting liability to knowing violations. See <i>Ratzlaf v. United States,</i> 510 U.S. 135, 137, 114 S.Ct. 655, 126 L.Ed.2d 615 (1994); <i>Bryan v. United States,</i> 524 U.S. 184, 191-192, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998); <i>Cheek v. United States,</i> 498 U.S. 192, 200-201, 111 S.Ct. 604, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991). This reading of the term, however, is tailored to the criminal law, where it is characteristically used to require a criminal intent beyond the purpose otherwise required for guilt, <i>Ratzlaf, supra,</i> at 136-137, 114 S.Ct. 655; or an additional \"`bad purpose,'\" <i>Bryan, supra,</i> at 191, 118 S.Ct. 1939; or specific intent to violate a known legal duty created by highly technical statutes, <i>Cheek, supra,</i> at 200-201, 111 S.Ct. 604. Thus we have consistently held that a defendant cannot harbor such criminal intent unless he \"acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.\" <i>Bryan, supra,</i> at 193, 118 S.Ct. 1939. Civil use of the term, however, typically presents neither the textual nor the substantive reasons for pegging the threshold of liability at knowledge of wrongdoing. Cf. <i>Farmer v. Brennan,</i> 511 U.S. 825, 836-837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (contrasting the different uses of the term \"recklessness\" in civil and criminal contexts).</p>\n<p>[10]  Since the posted price seems to be addressed to the world in general, one could argue that the increased gas price is not the initial quote. But the same usage point can be made with the example of the clothing model who gets a call from a ritzy store after posing for a discount retailer. If she quotes a higher fee, it would be natural to say that the uptown store will have to pay the \"increase\" to have her in its ad.</p>\n<p>[11]  See S.Rep. No. 91-517, p. 7 (1969) (\"Those who ... charge a higher rate for credit or insurance wholly or partly because of a consumer report must, upon written request, so advise the consumer ...\"); S.Rep. No. 103-209, p. 4 (1993) (adverse action notice is required \"any time the permissible use of a report results in an outcome adverse to the interests of the consumer\"); H.R.Rep. No. 103-486, p. 26 (1994) (\"[W]henever a consumer report is obtained for a permissible purpose ..., any action taken based on that report that is adverse to the interests of the consumer triggers the adverse action notice requirements\").</p>\n<p>[12]  In fact, notice in the context of an initially offered rate may be of greater significance than notice in the context of a renewal rate; if, for instance, insurance is offered on the basis of a single, long-term guaranteed rate, a consumer who is not given notice during the initial application process may never have an opportunity to learn of any adverse treatment.</p>\n<p>[13]  For instance, if a consumer's driving record is so poor that no insurer would give him anything but the highest possible rate regardless of his credit report, whether or not an insurer happened to look at his credit report should have no bearing on whether the consumer must receive notice, since he has not been treated differently as a result of it.</p>\n<p>[14]  The history of the Act provides further support for this reading. The originally enacted version of the notice requirement stated: \"Whenever ... the charge for ... insurance is increased either wholly or partly because of information contained in a consumer report..., the user of the consumer report shall so advise the consumer ... .\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(a) (1976 ed.). The \"because of\" language in the original statute emphasized that the consumer report must actually have caused the adverse action for the notice requirement to apply. When Congress amended FCRA in 1996, it sought to define \"adverse action\" with greater particularity, and thus split the notice provision into two separate subsections. See 110 Stat. 3009-426 to 3009-427, 3009-443 to 3009-444. In the revised version of \u00a7 1681m(a), the original \"because of\" phrasing changed to \"based on,\" but there was no indication that this change was meant to be a substantive alteration of the statute's scope.</p>\n<p>[15]  While it might seem odd, under the current statutory structure, to interpret the definition of \"adverse action\" (in \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i)) in conjunction with \u00a7 1681m(a), which simply applies the notice requirement to a particular subset of \"adverse actions,\" there are strong indications that Congress intended these provisions to be construed in tandem. When FCRA was initially enacted, the link between the definition of \"adverse action\" and the notice requirement was clear, since \"adverse action\" was defined within \u00a7 1681m(a). See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(a) (1976 ed.). Though Congress eventually split the provision into two parts (with the definition of \"adverse action\" now located at \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i)), the legislative history suggests that this change was not meant to alter Congress's intent to define \"adverse action\" in light of the notice requirement. See S.Rep. No. 103-209, at 4 (\"The Committee bill ... defines an `adverse action' as any action that is adverse to the interests of the consumer and is based in whole or in part on a consumer report\"); H.R.Rep. No. 103-486, at 26 (\"[A]ny action based on [a consumer] report that is adverse to the interests of the consumer triggers the adverse action notice requirements\").</p>\n<p>[16]  Consider, too, a consumer who, at the initial application stage, had a perfect credit score and thus obtained the best insurance rate, but, at the renewal stage, was charged at a higher rate (but still lower than the rate he would have received had his credit report not been taken into account) solely because his credit score fell during the interim. Although the consumer clearly suffered an \"increase\" in his insurance rate that was \"based on\" his credit score, he would not be entitled to an adverse action notice under the baseline used for initial applications.</p>\n<p>[17]  We reject Edo's alternative argument that GEICO's offer of a standard insurance policy with GEICO Indemnity was an \"adverse action\" requiring notice because it amounted to a \"denial\" of insurance through a lower cost, \"preferred\" policy with GEICO General. See \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i) (defining \"adverse action\" to include a \"denial ... of ... insurance\"). An applicant calling GEICO for insurance talks with a sales representative who acts for all the GEICO companies. The record has no indication that GEICO tells applicants about its corporate structure, or that applicants request insurance from one of the several companies or even know of their separate existence. The salesperson takes information from the applicant and obtains his credit score, then either denies any insurance or assigns him to one of the companies willing to provide it; the other companies receive no application and take no separate action. This way of accepting new business is clearly outside the natural meaning of \"denial\" of insurance.</p>\n<p>[18]  Unlike civil recklessness, criminal recklessness also requires subjective knowledge on the part of the offender. <i>Brennan,</i> 511 U.S., at 836-837, 114 S.Ct. 1970; ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02(2)(c) (1985).</p>\n<p>[19]  Respondent-plaintiffs point to a letter, written by an FTC staff member to an insurance company lawyer, that suggests that an \"adverse action\" occurs when \"the applicant will have to pay more for insurance at the inception of the policy than he or she would have been charged if the consumer report had been more favorable.\" Letter from Hannah A. Stires to James M. Ball (Mar. 1, 2000), http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcra/ball.htm (as visited May 17, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). But the letter did not canvas the issue, and it explicitly indicated that it was merely \"an informal staff opinion ... not binding on the Commission.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>[20]  Respondent-plaintiffs argue that evidence of subjective bad faith must be taken into account in determining whether a company acted knowingly or recklessly for purposes of \u00a7 1681n(a). To the extent that they argue that evidence of subjective bad faith can support a willfulness finding even when the company's reading of the statute is objectively reasonable, their argument is unsound. Where, as here, the statutory text and relevant court and agency guidance allow for more than one reasonable interpretation, it would defy history and current thinking to treat a defendant who merely adopts one such interpretation as a knowing or reckless violator. Congress could not have intended such a result for those who followed an interpretation that could reasonably have found support in the courts, whatever their subjective intent may have been.\n</p>\n<p>Both Safeco and GEICO argue that good-faith reliance on legal advice should render companies immune to claims raised under \u00a7 1681n(a). While we do not foreclose this possibility, we need not address the issue here in light of our present holdings.</p>\n<p>[1]  Stranger still, companies that automatically disqualify consumers who lack credit reports will never need to send any adverse action notices. After all, the Court's baseline is \"what the applicant would have had if the company had not taken his credit score into account,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2213, but from such companies, what the applicant \"would have had\" is no insurance at all. An offer of insurance at <i>any</i> price, however inflated by a poor and perhaps incorrect credit score, will therefore never constitute an adverse action.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court also justifies its deviation from the statute's text by reasoning that frequent adverse action notices would be ignored. See <i>ante,</i> at 2213-2214. To borrow a sentence from the Court's opinion: \"Perhaps.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2209. But rather than speculate about the likely effect of \"hypernotification,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2214, I would defer to the Solicitor General's position, informed by the Federal Trade Commission's expert judgment, that consumers by and large benefit from adverse action notices, however common. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27-29.</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued January 16, 2007 \u2014Decided June 4, 2007*\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires notice to a consumer\n  subjected to \u201cadverse action . . . based in whole or in part on any in\n  formation contained in a consumer [credit] report.\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71681m(a). As applied to insurance companies, \u201cadverse action\u201d is \u201ca\n  denial or cancellation of, an increase in any charge for, or a reduction\n  or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or\n  amount of, any insurance, existing or applied for.\u201d \u00a71681a(k)(1)(B)(i).\n  FCRA provides a private right of action against businesses that use\n  consumer reports but fail to comply. A negligent violation entitles a\n  consumer to actual damages, \u00a71681o(a), and a willful one entitles the\n  consumer to actual, statutory, and even punitive damages, \u00a71681n(a).\n     Petitioners in No. 06\u2013100 (GEICO) use an applicant\u2019s credit score\n  to select the appropriate subsidiary insurance company and the par\n  ticular rate at which a policy may be issued. GEICO sends an ad\n  verse action notice only if a neutral credit score would have put the\n  applicant in a lower priced tier or company; the applicant is not oth\n  erwise told if he would have gotten better terms with a better credit\n  score. Respondent Edo\u2019s credit score was taken into account when\n  GEICO issued him a policy, but GEICO sent no adverse action notice\n  because his company and tier placement would have been the same\n  with a neutral score. Edo filed a proposed class action, alleging will\n  ful violation of \u00a71681m(a) and seeking statutory and punitive dam\n  ages under \u00a71681n(a). The District Court granted GEICO summary\n  judgment, finding no adverse action because the premium would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 06\u2013100, GEICO General Insurance Co. et al. v.\nEdo, also on certiorari to the same court.\n2               SAFECO INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. BURR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    have been the same had Edo\u2019s credit history not been considered. Pe\n    titioners in No. 06\u2013100 (Safeco) also rely on credit reports to set ini\n    tial insurance premiums. Respondents Burr and Massey\u2014whom\n    Safeco offered higher than the best rates possible without sending\n    adverse action notices\u2014joined a proposed class action, alleging will\n    ful violation of \u00a71681m(a) and seeking statutory and punitive dam\n    ages under \u00a71681n(a). The District Court granted Safeco summary\n    judgment on the ground that offering a single, initial rate for insur\n    ance cannot be \u201cadverse action.\u201d The Ninth Circuit reversed both\n    judgments. In GEICO\u2019s case, it held that an adverse action occurs\n    whenever a consumer would have received a lower rate had his con\n    sumer report contained more favorable information. Since that\n    would have happened to Edo, GEICO\u2019s failure to give notice was an\n    adverse action. The court also held that an insurer willfully fails to\n    comply with FCRA if it acts in reckless disregard of a consumer\u2019s\n    FCRA rights, remanding for further proceedings on the reckless dis\n    regard issue. Relying on its decision in GEICO\u2019s case, the Ninth Cir\n    cuit rejected the District Court\u2019s position in the Safeco case and re\n    manded for further proceedings.\nHeld:\n    1. Willful failure covers a violation committed in reckless disregard\n of the notice obligation. Where willfulness is a statutory condition of\n civil liability, it is generally taken to cover not only knowing viola\n tions of a standard, but reckless ones as well. See, e.g., McLaughlin\n v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U. S. 128, 133. This construction reflects\n common law usage. The standard civil usage thus counsels reading\n \u00a71681n(a)\u2019s phrase \u201cwillfully fails to comply\u201d as reaching reckless\n FCRA violations, both on the interpretive assumption that Congress\n knows how this Court construes statutes and expects it to run true to\n form, see Commissioner v.

Prupis, 529 U. S. 494, 500\u2013501. Petitioners claim\n that \u00a71681n(a)\u2019s drafting history points to a reading that liability at\n taches only to knowing violations, but the text as finally adopted\n points to the traditional understanding of willfulness in the civil\n sphere.

These descriptions do nothing to suggest that remedies\nfor consumers disadvantaged by unsound credit ratings should be\ndenied to first-time victims, and the legislative histories of both\nFCRA\u2019s original enactment and a 1996 amendment reveal no reason\nto confine attention to customers and businesses with prior dealings.\nFinally, nothing about insurance contracts suggests that Congress\nmeant to differentiate applicants from existing customers when it set\nthe notice requirement; the newly insured who gets charged more ow\ning to an erroneous report is in the same boat with the renewal appli\ncant. Pp. 10\u201313.\n      (b) An increased rate is not \u201cbased in whole or in part on\u201d a credit\nreport under \u00a71681m(a) unless the report was a necessary condition\nof the increase. In common talk, \u201cbased on\u201d indicates a but-for causal\nrelationship and thus a necessary logical condition. Though some\ntextual arguments point another way, it makes more sense to suspect\nthat Congress meant to require notice and prompt a consumer chal\nlenge only when the consumer would gain something if the challenge\nsucceeded. Pp. 13\u201314.\n      (c) In determining whether a first-time rate is a disadvantageous\nincrease, the baseline is the rate that the applicant would have re\nceived had the company not taken his credit score into account (the\n\u201cneutral score\u201d rate GEICO used in Edo\u2019s case). That baseline com\nports with the understanding that \u00a71681m(a) notice is required only\nwhen the credit report\u2019s effect on the initial rate is necessary to put\nthe consumer in a worse position than other relevant facts would\nhave decreed anyway. Congress was more likely concerned with the\npractical question whether the consumer\u2019s rate actually suffered\nwhen his credit report was taken into account than the theoretical\nquestion whether the consumer would have gotten a better rate with\nthe best possible credit score, the baseline suggested by the Govern\nment and respondent-plaintiffs. The Government\u2019s objection to this\nreading is rejected. Although the rate initially offered for new insur\nance is an \u201cincrease\u201d calling for notice if it exceeds the neutral rate,\nonce a consumer has learned that his credit report led the insurer to\ncharge more, he need not be told with each renewal if his rate has not\nchanged. After initial dealing between the consumer and the insurer,\nthe baseline for \u201cincrease\u201d is the previous rate or charge, not the\n\u201cneutral\u201d baseline that applies at the start. Pp. 15\u201317.\n   3. GEICO did not violate the statute, and while Safeco might have,\nit did not act recklessly. Pp. 18\u201321.\n      (a) Because the initial rate GEICO offered Edo was what he\nwould have received had his credit score not been taken into account,\n4               SAFECO INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. BURR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    GEICO owed him no adverse action notice under \u00a71681m(a). P. 18.\n         (b) Even if Safeco violated FCRA when it failed to give Burr and\n    Massey notice on the mistaken belief that \u00a71681m(a) did not apply to\n    initial applications, the company was not reckless. The common law\n    has generally understood \u201crecklessness\u201d in the civil liability sphere as\n    conduct violating an objective standard: action entailing \u201can unjusti\n    fiably high risk of harm that is either known or so obvious that it\n    should be known.\u201d Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 836. There be\n    ing no indication that Congress had something different in mind,\n    there is no reason to deviate from the common law understanding in\n    applying the statute. See Beck v. Prupis, 529 U. S., at 500\u2013501.\n    Thus, a company does not act in reckless disregard of FCRA unless\n    the action is not only a violation under a reasonable reading of the\n    statute, but shows that the company ran a risk of violating the law\n    substantially greater than the risk associated with a reading that\n    was merely careless. The negligence/recklessness line need not be\n    pinpointed here, for Safeco\u2019s reading of the statute, albeit erroneous,\n    was not objectively unreasonable. Section 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i) is silent\n    on the point from which to measure \u201cincrease,\u201d and Safeco\u2019s reading\n    has a foundation in the statutory text and a sufficiently convincing\n    justification to have persuaded the District Court to adopt it and rule\n    in Safeco\u2019s favor. Before these cases, no court of appeals had spoken\n    on the issue, and no authoritative guidance has yet come from the\n    Federal Trade Commission. Given this dearth of guidance and the\n    less-than-pellucid statutory text, Safeco\u2019s reading was not objectively\n    unreasonable, and so falls well short of raising the \u201cunjustifiably high\n    risk\u201d of violating the statute necessary for reckless liability.

See 84 Stat.\n1128, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71681; TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S.\n19, 23 (2001). The Act requires, among other things, that\n\u201cany person [who] takes any adverse action with respect to\nany consumer that is based in whole or in part on any\ninformation contained in a consumer report\u201d must notify\nthe affected consumer.1 15 U. S. C. \u00a71681m(a). The notice\nmust point out the adverse action, explain how to reach\nthe agency that reported on the consumer\u2019s credit, and tell\nthe consumer that he can get a free copy of the report and\ndispute its accuracy with the agency. Ibid. As it applies\nto an insurance company, \u201cadverse action\u201d is \u201ca denial or\ncancellation of, an increase in any charge for, or a reduc\ntion or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of\ncoverage or amount of, any insurance, existing or applied\nfor.\u201d \u00a71681a(k)(1)(B)(i).\n   FCRA provides a private right of action against busi\nnesses that use consumer reports but fail to comply. If a\nviolation is negligent, the affected consumer is entitled to\nactual damages. \u00a71681o(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). If willful,\nhowever, the consumer may have actual damages, or\nstatutory damages ranging from $100 to $1,000, and even\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 So far as it matters here, the Act defines \u201cconsumer report\u201d as \u201cany\n\nwritten, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer\nreporting agency bearing on a consumer\u2019s credit worthiness, credit\nstanding, [or] credit capacity . . . which is used or expected to be used or\ncollected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in\nestablishing the consumer\u2019s eligibility for . . . credit or insurance to be\nused primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\u201d 15 U.

Potential customers call a toll-free\nnumber answered by an agent of the four affiliates, who\ntakes information and, with permission, gets the appli\ncant\u2019s credit score.3 This information goes into GEICO\u2019s\ncomputer system, which selects any appropriate company\nand the particular rate at which a policy may be issued.\n  For some time after FCRA went into effect, GEICO sent\nadverse action notices to all applicants who were not\noffered \u201cpreferred\u201d policies from GEICO General or Gov\nernment Employees. GEICO changed its practice, how\never, after a method to \u201cneutralize\u201d an applicant\u2019s credit\nscore was devised: the applicant\u2019s company and tier\nplacement is compared with the company and tier place\nment he would have been assigned with a \u201cneutral\u201d credit\nscore, that is, one calculated without reliance on credit\nhistory.4 Under this new scheme, it is only if using a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The specific petitioners are subsidiary companies of the GEICO Cor\nporation; for the sake of convenience, we call them \u201cGEICO\u201d collectively.\n  3 The Act defines a \u201ccredit score\u201d as \u201ca numerical value or a categori\n\nzation derived from a statistical tool or modeling system used by a\nperson who makes or arranges a loan to predict the likelihood of certain\ncredit behaviors, including default.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71681g(f)(2)(A) (2000\ned., Supp. IV). Under its contract with its credit information providers,\nGEICO learned credit scores and facts in the credit reports that signifi\ncantly influenced the scores, but did not have access to the credit\nreports themselves.\n  4 A number of States permit the use of such \u201cneutral\u201d credit scores to\n4             SAFECO INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. BURR\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nneutral credit score would have put the applicant in a\nlower priced tier or company that GEICO sends an ad\nverse action notice; the applicant is not otherwise told if he\nwould have gotten better terms with a better credit score.\n  Respondent Ajene Edo applied for auto insurance with\nGEICO. After obtaining Edo\u2019s credit score, GEICO offered\nhim a standard policy with GEICO Indemnity (at rates\nhigher than the most favorable), which he accepted. Be\ncause Edo\u2019s company and tier placement would have been\nthe same with a neutral score, GEICO did not give Edo an\nadverse action notice. Edo later filed this proposed class\naction against GEICO, alleging willful failure to give\nnotice in violation of \u00a71681m(a); he claimed no actual\nharm, but sought statutory and punitive damages under\n\u00a71681n(a). The District Court granted summary judgment\nfor GEICO, finding there was no adverse action when \u201cthe\npremium charged to [Edo] . . . would have been the same\neven if GEICO Indemnity did not consider information in\n[his] consumer credit history.\u201d Edo v. GEICO Casualty\nCo., CV 02\u2013678\u2013BR, 2004 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 28522, *12\n(D.

Safeco\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nensure that consumers with thin or unidentifiable credit histories are\nnot treated disadvantageously. See, e.g., N. Y. Ins.

The District Court\nordered summary judgment for Safeco, on the understand\ning that offering a single, initial rate for insurance cannot\nbe \u201cadverse action.\u201d\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed\nboth judgments. In GEICO\u2019s case, it held that whenever a\nconsumer \u201cwould have received a lower rate for his insur\nance had the information in his consumer report been\nmore favorable, an adverse action has been taken against\nhim.\u201d Reynolds v. Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc.,\n435 F. 3d 1081, 1093 (2006). Since a better credit score\nwould have placed Edo with GEICO General, not GEICO\nIndemnity, the appeals court held that GEICO\u2019s failure to\ngive notice was an adverse action.\n   The Ninth Circuit also held that an insurer \u201cwillfully\u201d\nfails to comply with FCRA if it acts with \u201creckless disre\ngard\u201d of a consumer\u2019s rights under the Act. Id., at 1099.\nIt explained that a company would not be acting recklessly\nif it \u201cdiligently and in good faith attempted to fulfill its\nstatutory obligations\u201d and came to a \u201ctenable, albeit erro\nneous, interpretation of the statute.\u201d Ibid. The court went\non to say that \u201ca deliberate failure to determine the extent\nof its obligations\u201d would not ordinarily escape liability\nunder \u00a71681n, any more than \u201creliance on creative lawyer\ning that provides indefensible answers.\u201d Ibid. Because\nthe court believed that the enquiry into GEICO\u2019s reckless\ndisregard might turn on undisclosed circumstances sur\nrounding GEICO\u2019s revision of its notification policy, the\nCourt of Appeals remanded the company\u2019s case for further\nproceedings.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Prior to issuing its final opinion in this case, the Court of Appeals\n\nhad issued, then withdrawn, two opinions in which it held that GEICO\n6             SAFECO INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. BURR\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   In the action against Safeco, the Court of Appeals re\njected the District Court\u2019s position, relying on its reasoning\nin GEICO\u2019s case (where it had held that the notice re\nquirement applies to a single statement of an initial charge\nfor a new policy). Spano v. Safeco Corp., 140 Fed. Appx.\n746 (2005). The Court of Appeals also rejected Safeco\u2019s\nargument that its conduct was not willful, again citing the\nGEICO case, and remanded for further proceedings.\n   We consolidated the two matters and granted certiorari\nto resolve a conflict in the Circuits as to whether\n\u00a71681n(a) reaches reckless disregard of FCRA\u2019s obliga\ntions,8 and to clarify the notice requirement in \u00a71681m(a).\n548 U. S. ___ (2006). We now reverse in both cases.\n                               II\n   GEICO and Safeco argue that liability under \u00a71681n(a)\nfor \u201cwillfully fail[ing] to comply\u201d with FCRA goes only to\nacts known to violate the Act, not to reckless disregard of\nstatutory duty, but we think they are wrong.

The standard civil\nusage thus counsels reading the phrase \u201cwillfully fails to\ncomply\u201d in \u00a71681n(a) as reaching reckless FCRA viola\ntions,9 and this is so both on the interpretive assumption\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 It is different in the criminal law. When the term \u201cwillful\u201d or \u201cwill\n\nfully\u201d has been used in a criminal statute, we have regularly read the\nmodifier as limiting liability to knowing violations. See Ratzlaf v.\nUnited States, 510 U. S. 135, 137 (1994); Bryan v. United States, 524\nU. S. 184, 191\u2013192 (1998); Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S. 192, 200\u2013\n201 (1991). This reading of the term, however, is tailored to the crimi\nnal law, where it is characteristically used to require a criminal intent\nbeyond the purpose otherwise required for guilt, Ratzlaf, supra, at 136\u2013\n137; or an additional \u201c \u2018bad purpose,\u2019 \u201d Bryan, supra, at 191; or specific\nintent to violate a known legal duty created by highly technical stat\nutes, Cheek, supra, at 200\u2013201. Thus we have consistently held that a\ndefendant cannot harbor such criminal intent unless he \u201cacted with\nknowledge that his conduct was unlawful.\u201d Bryan, supra, at 193. Civil\nuse of the term, however, typically presents neither the textual nor the\nsubstantive reasons for pegging the threshold of liability at knowledge\nof wrongdoing. Cf. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 836\u2013837 (1994)\n8             SAFECO INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. BURR\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthat Congress knows how we construe statutes and ex\npects us to run true to form, see Commissioner v. Keystone\nConsol. Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 159 (1993), and\nunder the general rule that a common law term in a stat\nute comes with a common law meaning, absent anything\npointing another way, Beck v. Prupis, 529 U. S. 494, 500\u2013\n501 (2000).\n   GEICO and Safeco argue that Congress did point to\nsomething different in FCRA, by a drafting history of\n\u00a71681n(a) said to show that liability was supposed to\nattach only to knowing violations. The original version of\nthe Senate bill that turned out as FCRA had two stan\ndards of liability to victims: grossly negligent violation\n(supporting actual damages) and willful violation (sup\nporting actual, statutory, and punitive damages). S. 823,\n91st Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a71 (1969). GEICO and Safeco argue\nthat since a \u201cgross negligence\u201d standard is effectively the\nsame as a \u201creckless disregard\u201d standard, the original bill\u2019s\n\u201cwillfulness\u201d standard must have meant a level of culpa\nbility higher than \u201creckless disregard,\u201d or there would\nhave been no requirement to show a different state of\nmind as a condition of the potentially much greater liabil\nity; thus, \u201cwillfully fails to comply\u201d must have referred to a\nknowing violation. Although the gross negligence stan\ndard was reduced later in the legislative process to simple\nnegligence (as it now appears in \u00a71681o), the provision for\nwillful liability remains unchanged and so must require\nknowing action, just as it did originally in the draft of\n\u00a71681n.\n   Perhaps. But Congress may have scaled the standard\nfor actual damages down to simple negligence because it\nthought gross negligence, being like reckless action, was\ncovered by willfulness. Because this alternative reading is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n(contrasting the different uses of the term \u201crecklessness\u201d in civil and \n\ncriminal contexts). \n\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npossible, any inference from the drafting sequence is\nshaky, and certainly no match for the following clue in the\ntext as finally adopted, which points to the traditional\nunderstanding of willfulness in the civil sphere.\n   The phrase in question appears in the preamble sen\ntence of \u00a71681n(a): \u201cAny person who willfully fails to\ncomply with any requirement imposed under this sub\nchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that\nconsumer . . . .\u201d Then come the details, in paragraphs\n(1)(A) and (1)(B), spelling out two distinct measures of\ndamages chargeable against the willful violator. As a\ngeneral matter, the consumer may get either actual dam\nages or \u201cdamages of not less than $100 and not more than\n$1,000.\u201d \u00a71681n(a)(1)(A). But where the offender is liable\n\u201cfor obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or\nknowingly without a permissible purpose,\u201d the statute sets\nliability higher: \u201cactual damages . . . or $1,000, whichever\nis greater.\u201d \u00a71681n(a)(1)(B).\n   If the companies were right that \u201cwillfully\u201d limits liabil\nity under \u00a71681n(a) to knowing violations, the modifier\n\u201cknowingly\u201d in \u00a71681n(a)(1)(B) would be superfluous and\nincongruous; it would have made no sense for Congress to\ncondition the higher damages under \u00a71681n(a) on know\ningly obtaining a report without a permissible purpose if\nthe general threshold of any liability under the section\nwere knowing misconduct. If, on the other hand, \u201cwill\nfully\u201d covers both knowing and reckless disregard of the\nlaw, knowing violations are sensibly understood as a more\nserious subcategory of willful ones, and both the preamble\nand the subsection have distinct jobs to do. See United\nStates v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538\u2013539 (1955) (\u201c \u2018[G]ive\neffect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute\u2019 \u201d\n(quoting Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U. S. 147, 152\n(1883))).\n   The companies make other textual and structural ar\nguments for their view, but none is persuasive. Safeco\n10          SAFECO INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. BURR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthinks our reading would lead to the absurd result that\none could, with reckless disregard, knowingly obtain a\nconsumer report without a permissible purpose. But this\nis not so; action falling within the knowing subcategory\ndoes not simultaneously fall within the reckless alterna\ntive. Then both GEICO and Safeco argue that the refer\nence to acting \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d in FCRA\u2019s crimi\nnal enforcement provisions, \u00a71681q and \u00a71681r, indicates\nthat \u201cwillfully\u201d cannot include recklessness. But we are\nnow on the criminal side of the law, where the paired\nmodifiers are often found, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a71001 (2000\ned. and Supp. IV) (false statements to federal investiga\ntors); 20 U. S. C. \u00a71097(a) (embezzlement of student loan\nfunds); 18 U. S. C. \u00a71542 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) (false\nstatements in a passport application). As we said before,\nin the criminal law \u201cwillfully\u201d typically narrows the oth\nerwise sufficient intent, making the government prove\nsomething extra, in contrast to its civil-law usage, giving a\nplaintiff a choice of mental states to show in making a case\nfor liability, see n. 9, supra. The vocabulary of the crimi\nnal side of FCRA is consequently beside the point in con\nstruing the civil side.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  Before getting to the claims that the companies acted\nrecklessly, we have the antecedent question whether\neither company violated the adverse action notice re\nquirement at all. In both cases, respondent-plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims are premised on initial rates charged for new in\nsurance policies, which are not \u201cadverse\u201d actions unless\nquoting or charging a first-time premium is \u201can increase\nin any charge for . . . any insurance, existing or applied\nfor.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71681a(k)(1)(B)(i).\n  In Safeco\u2019s case, the District Court held that the initial\nrate for a new insurance policy cannot be an \u201cincrease\u201d\n                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause there is no prior dealing. The phrase \u201cincrease in\nany charge for . . . insurance\u201d is readily understood to\nmean a change in treatment for an insured, which as\nsumes a previous charge for comparison. See Webster\u2019s\nNew International Dictionary 1260 (2d ed. 1957) (defining\n\u201cincrease\u201d as \u201c[a]ddition or enlargement in size, extent,\nquantity, number, intensity, value, substance, etc.; aug\nmentation; growth; multiplication\u201d). Since the District\nCourt understood \u201cincrease\u201d to speak of change just as\nmuch as of comparative size or quantity, it reasoned that\nthe statute\u2019s \u201cincrease\u201d never touches the initial rate offer,\nwhere there is no change.\n  The Government takes the part of the Court of Appeals\nin construing \u201cincrease\u201d to reach a first-time rate. It says\nthat regular usage of the term is not as narrow as the\nDistrict Court thought: the point from which to measure\ndifference can just as easily be understood without refer\nring to prior individual dealing. The Government gives\nthe example of a gas station owner who charges more than\nthe posted price for gas to customers he doesn\u2019t like; it\nmakes sense to say that the owner increases the price and\nthat the driver pays an increased price, even if he never\npulled in there for gas before. See Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 26.10 The Government implies, then,\nthat reading \u201cincrease\u201d requires a choice, and the chosen\nreading should be the broad one in order to conform to\nwhat Congress had in mind.\n  We think the Government\u2019s reading has the better fit\nwith the ambitious objective set out in the Act\u2019s statement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Since the posted price seems to be addressed to the world in gen\n\neral, one could argue that the increased gas price is not the initial\nquote. But the same usage point can be made with the example of the\nclothing model who gets a call from a ritzy store after posing for a\ndiscount retailer. If she quotes a higher fee, it would be natural to say\nthat the uptown store will have to pay the \u201cincrease\u201d to have her in its\nad.\n12             SAFECO INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. BURR\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nof purpose, which uses expansive terms to describe the\nadverse effects of unfair and inaccurate credit reporting\nand the responsibilities of consumer reporting agencies.\nSee \u00a71681(a) (inaccurate reports \u201cdirectly impair the\nefficiency of the banking system\u201d; unfair reporting meth\nods undermine public confidence \u201cessential to the contin\nued functioning of the banking system\u201d; need to \u201cinsure\u201d\nthat reporting agencies \u201cexercise their grave responsibili\nties\u201d fairly, impartially, and with respect for privacy). The\ndescriptions of systemic problem and systemic need as\nCongress saw them do nothing to suggest that remedies\nfor consumers placed at a disadvantage by unsound credit\nratings should be denied to first-time victims, and the\nlegislative histories of FCRA\u2019s original enactment and of\nthe 1996 amendment reveal no reason to confine attention\nto customers and businesses with prior dealings. Quite\nthe contrary.11 Finally, there is nothing about insurance\ncontracts to suggest that Congress might have meant to\ndifferentiate applicants from existing customers when it\nset the notice requirement; the newly insured who gets\ncharged more owing to an erroneous report is in the same\nboat with the renewal applicant.12 We therefore hold that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    11 See S. Rep.

C.\n\u00a71681a(k)(1)(B)(i), speaks to a disadvantageous rate even\nwith no prior dealing; the term reaches initial rates for\nnew applicants.\n                               B\n   Although offering the initial rate for new insurance can\nbe an \u201cadverse action,\u201d respondent-plaintiffs have another\nhurdle to clear, for \u00a71681m(a) calls for notice only when\nthe adverse action is \u201cbased in whole or in part on\u201d a credit\nreport. GEICO argues that in order to have adverse ac\ntion \u201cbased on\u201d a credit report, consideration of the report\nmust be a necessary condition for the increased rate. The\nGovernment and respondent-plaintiffs do not explicitly\ntake a position on this point.\n   To the extent there is any disagreement on the issue, we\naccept GEICO\u2019s reading. In common talk, the phrase\n\u201cbased on\u201d indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus\na necessary logical condition. Under this most natural\nreading of \u00a71681m(a), then, an increased rate is not \u201cbased\nin whole or in part on\u201d the credit report unless the report\nwas a necessary condition of the increase.\n   As before, there are textual arguments pointing another\nway. The statute speaks in terms of basing the action \u201cin\npart\u201d as well as wholly on the credit report, and this\nphrasing could mean that adverse action is \u201cbased on\u201d a\ncredit report whenever the report was considered in the\nrate-setting process, even without being a necessary condi\ntion for the rate increase. But there are good reasons to\nthink Congress preferred GEICO\u2019s necessary-condition\nreading.\n   If the statute has any claim to lucidity, not all \u201cadverse\nactions\u201d require notice, only those \u201cbased . . . on\u201d informa\ntion in a credit report. Since the statute does not explicitly\ncall for notice when a business acts adversely merely after\nconsulting a report, conditioning the requirement on\n14             SAFECO INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. BURR\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\naction \u201cbased . . . on\u201d a report suggests that the duty to\nreport arises from some practical consequence of reading\nthe report, not merely some subsequent adverse occur\nrence that would have happened anyway. If the credit\nreport has no identifiable effect on the rate, the consumer\nhas no immediately practical reason to worry about it\n(unless he has the power to change every other fact that\nstands between himself and the best possible deal); both\nthe company and the consumer are just where they would\nhave been if the company had never seen the report.13\nAnd if examining reports that make no difference was\nsupposed to trigger a reporting requirement, it would be\nhard to find any practical point in imposing the \u201cbased . . .\non\u201d restriction. So it makes more sense to suspect that\nCongress meant to require notice and prompt a challenge\nby the consumer only when the consumer would gain\nsomething if the challenge succeeded.14\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 For instance, if a consumer\u2019s driving record is so poor that no in\n\nsurer would give him anything but the highest possible rate regardless\nof his credit report, whether or not an insurer happened to look at his\ncredit report should have no bearing on whether the consumer must\nreceive notice, since he has not been treated differently as a result of it.\n  14 The history of the Act provides further support for this reading.\n\nThe originally enacted version of the notice requirement stated: \u201cWhen\never . . . the charge for . . . insurance is increased either wholly or partly\nbecause of information contained in a consumer report . . . , the user of\nthe consumer report shall so advise the consumer . . . .\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71681m(a) (1976 ed.). The \u201cbecause of\u201d language in the original statute\nemphasized that the consumer report must actually have caused the\nadverse action for the notice requirement to apply. When Congress\namended FCRA in 1996, it sought to define \u201cadverse action\u201d with\ngreater particularity, and thus split the notice provision into two\nseparate subsections. See 110 Stat. 3009\u2013426 to 3009\u2013427, 3009\u2013443\nto 3009\u2013444. In the revised version of \u00a71681m(a), the original \u201cbecause\nof\u201d phrasing changed to \u201cbased on,\u201d but there was no indication that\nthis change was meant to be a substantive alteration of the statute\u2019s\nscope.\n                    Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                               C\n   To sum up, the difference required for an increase can\nbe understood without reference to prior dealing (allowing\na first-time applicant to sue), and considering the credit\nreport must be a necessary condition for the difference.\nThe remaining step in determining a duty to notify in\ncases like these is identifying the benchmark for determin\ning whether a first-time rate is a disadvantageous in\ncrease. And in dealing with this issue, the pragmatic\nreading of \u201cbased . . . on\u201d as a condition necessary to make\na practical difference carries a helpful suggestion.\n   The Government and respondent-plaintiffs argue that\nthe baseline should be the rate that the applicant would\nhave received with the best possible credit score, while\nGEICO contends it is what the applicant would have had\nif the company had not taken his credit score into account\n(the \u201cneutral score\u201d rate GEICO used in Edo\u2019s case). We\nthink GEICO has the better position, primarily because its\n\u201cincrease\u201d baseline is more comfortable with the under\nstanding of causation just discussed, which requires notice\nunder \u00a71681m(a) only when the effect of the credit report\non the initial rate offered is necessary to put the consumer\nin a worse position than other relevant facts would have\ndecreed anyway. If Congress was this concerned with\npractical consequences when it adopted a \u201cbased . . . on\u201d\ncausation standard, it presumably thought in equally\npractical terms when it spoke of an \u201cincrease\u201d that must\nbe defined by a baseline to measure from. Congress was\ntherefore more likely concerned with the practical ques\ntion whether the consumer\u2019s rate actually suffered when\nthe company took his credit report into account than the\ntheoretical question whether the consumer would have\ngotten a better rate with perfect credit.15\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 While it might seem odd, under the current statutory structure, to\n\ninterpret the definition of \u201cadverse action\u201d (in \u00a71681a(k)(1)(B)(i)) in\n16             SAFECO INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. BURR\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government objects that this reading leaves a\nloophole, since it keeps first-time applicants who actually\ndeserve better-than-neutral credit scores from getting\nnotice, even when errors in credit reports saddle them\nwith unfair rates. This is true; the neutral-score baseline\nwill leave some consumers without a notice that might\nlead to discovering errors. But we do not know how often\nthese cases will occur, whereas we see a more demonstra\nble and serious disadvantage inhering in the Govern\nment\u2019s position.\n   Since the best rates (the Government\u2019s preferred base\nline) presumably go only to a minority of consumers,\nadopting the Government\u2019s view would require insurers to\nsend slews of adverse action notices; every young appli\ncant who had yet to establish a gilt-edged credit report, for\nexample, would get a notice that his charge had been\n\u201cincreased\u201d based on his credit report. We think that the\nconsequence of sending out notices on this scale would\nundercut the obvious policy behind the notice require\nment, for notices as common as these would take on the\ncharacter of formalities, and formalities tend to be ig\nnored. It would get around that new insurance usually\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nconjunction with \u00a71681m(a), which simply applies the notice require\nment to a particular subset of \u201cadverse actions,\u201d there are strong indica\ntions that Congress intended these provisions to be construed in tan\ndem. When FCRA was initially enacted, the link between the definition\nof \u201cadverse action\u201d and the notice requirement was clear, since \u201cadverse\naction\u201d was defined within \u00a71681m(a). See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71681m(a) (1976\ned.). Though Congress eventually split the provision into two parts\n(with the definition of \u201cadverse action\u201d now located at \u00a71681a(k)(1)(B)(i)),\nthe legislative history suggests that this change was not meant to alter\nCongress\u2019s intent to define \u201cadverse action\u201d in light of the notice re\nquirement.

Assuming that Congress meant a notice of adverse\naction to get some attention, we think the cost of closing\nthe loophole would be too high.\n   While on the subject of hypernotification, we should add\na word on another point of practical significance. Al\nthough the rate initially offered for new insurance is an\n\u201cincrease\u201d calling for notice if it exceeds the neutral rate,\ndid Congress intend the same baseline to apply if the\nquoted rate remains the same over a course of dealing,\nbeing repeated at each renewal date?\n   We cannot believe so. Once a consumer has learned\nthat his credit report led the insurer to charge more, he\nhas no need to be told over again with each renewal if his\nrate has not changed. For that matter, any other con\nstruction would probably stretch the word \u201cincrease\u201d more\nthan it could bear. Once the gas station owner had\ncharged the customer the above-market price, it would be\nstrange to speak of the same price as an increase every\ntime the customer pulled in. Once buyer and seller have\nbegun a course of dealing, customary usage does demand a\nchange for \u201cincrease\u201d to make sense.16 Thus, after initial\ndealing between the consumer and the insurer, the base\nline for \u201cincrease\u201d is the previous rate or charge, not the\n\u201cneutral\u201d baseline that applies at the start.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 Consider, too, a consumer who, at the initial application stage, had\na perfect credit score and thus obtained the best insurance rate, but, at\nthe renewal stage, was charged at a higher rate (but still lower than\nthe rate he would have received had his credit report not been taken\ninto account) solely because his credit score fell during the interim.\nAlthough the consumer clearly suffered an \u201cincrease\u201d in his insurance\nrate that was \u201cbased on\u201d his credit score, he would not be entitled to an\nadverse action notice under the baseline used for initial applications.\n18            SAFECO INS.

BURR\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                            IV \n\n                             A\n\n  In GEICO\u2019s case, the initial rate offered to Edo was the\none he would have received if his credit score had not been\ntaken into account, and GEICO owed him no adverse\naction notice under \u00a71681m(a).17\n                               B\n   Safeco did not give Burr and Massey any notice because\nit thought \u00a71681m(a) did not apply to initial applications,\na mistake that left the company in violation of the statute\nif Burr and Massey received higher rates \u201cbased in whole\nor in part\u201d on their credit reports; if they did, Safeco would\nbe liable to them on a showing of reckless conduct (or\nworse). The first issue we can forget, however, for al\nthough the record does not reliably indicate what rates\nthey would have obtained if their credit reports had not\nbeen considered, it is clear enough that if Safeco did vio\nlate the statute, the company was not reckless in falling\ndown in its duty.\n   While \u201cthe term recklessness is not self-defining,\u201d the\ncommon law has generally understood it in the sphere of\ncivil liability as conduct violating an objective standard:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    17 We reject Edo\u2019s alternative argument that GEICO\u2019s offer of a stan\n\ndard insurance policy with GEICO Indemnity was an \u201cadverse action\u201d\nrequiring notice because it amounted to a \u201cdenial\u201d of insurance through\na lower cost, \u201cpreferred\u201d policy with GEICO General.                   See\n\u00a71681a(k)(1)(B)(i) (defining \u201cadverse action\u201d to include a \u201cdenial . . . of\n. . . insurance\u201d). An applicant calling GEICO for insurance talks with a\nsales representative who acts for all the GEICO companies. The record\nhas no indication that GEICO tells applicants about its corporate\nstructure, or that applicants request insurance from one of the several\ncompanies or even know of their separate existence. The salesperson\ntakes information from the applicant and obtains his credit score, then\neither denies any insurance or assigns him to one of the companies\nwilling to provide it; the other companies receive no application and\ntake no separate action. This way of accepting new business is clearly\noutside the natural meaning of \u201cdenial\u201d of insurance.\n                    Cite as: 551 U.

Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 836 (1994); see Prosser\nand Keeton \u00a734, at 213\u2013214. The Restatement, for exam\nple, defines reckless disregard of a person\u2019s physical safety\nthis way:\n     \u201cThe actor\u2019s conduct is in reckless disregard of the\n     safety of another if he does an act or intentionally\n     fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do,\n     knowing or having reason to know of facts which\n     would lead a reasonable man to realize, not only that\n     his conduct creates an unreasonable risk of physical\n     harm to another, but also that such risk is substan\n     tially greater than that which is necessary to make\n     his conduct negligent.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts\n     \u00a7500, p. 587 (1963\u20131964).\nIt is this high risk of harm, objectively assessed, that is\nthe essence of recklessness at common law. See Prosser\nand Keeton \u00a734, at 213 (recklessness requires \u201ca known or\nobvious risk that was so great as to make it highly prob\nable that harm would follow\u201d).\n  There being no indication that Congress had something\ndifferent in mind, we have no reason to deviate from the\ncommon law understanding in applying the statute. See\nPrupis, 529 U. S., at 500\u2013501. Thus, a company subject to\nFCRA does not act in reckless disregard of it unless the\naction is not only a violation under a reasonable reading of\nthe statute\u2019s terms, but shows that the company ran a risk\nof violating the law substantially greater than the risk\nassociated with a reading that was merely careless.\n  Here, there is no need to pinpoint the negli\ngence/recklessness line, for Safeco\u2019s reading of the statute,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 Unlike civil recklessness, criminal recklessness also requires sub\n\njective knowledge on the part of the offender.

BURR\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nalbeit erroneous, was not objectively unreasonable. As we\nsaid, \u00a71681a(k)(1)(B)(i) is silent on the point from which to\nmeasure \u201cincrease.\u201d On the rationale that \u201cincrease\u201d\npresupposes prior dealing, Safeco took the definition as\nexcluding initial rate offers for new insurance, and so sent\nno adverse action notices to Burr and Massey. While we\ndisagree with Safeco\u2019s analysis, we recognize that its\nreading has a foundation in the statutory text, see supra,\nat 11, and a sufficiently convincing justification to have\npersuaded the District Court to adopt it and rule in\nSafeco\u2019s favor.\n   This is not a case in which the business subject to the\nAct had the benefit of guidance from the courts of appeals\nor the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that might have\nwarned it away from the view it took. Before these cases,\nno court of appeals had spoken on the issue, and no au\nthoritative guidance has yet come from the FTC19 (which\nin any case has only enforcement responsibility, not sub\nstantive rulemaking authority, for the provisions in ques\ntion, see 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71681s(a)(1), (e)). Cf. Saucier v.\nKatz, 533 U. S. 194, 202 (2001) (assessing, for qualified\nimmunity purposes, whether an action was reasonable in\nlight of legal rules that were \u201cclearly established\u201d at the\ntime). Given this dearth of guidance and the less-than\npellucid statutory text, Safeco\u2019s reading was not objec\ntively unreasonable, and so falls well short of raising the\n\u201cunjustifiably high risk\u201d of violating the statute necessary\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 Respondent-plaintiffs point to a letter, written by an FTC staff\n\nmember to an insurance company lawyer, that suggests that an \u201cad\nverse action\u201d occurs when \u201cthe applicant will have to pay more for\ninsurance at the inception of the policy than he or she would have been\ncharged if the consumer report had been more favorable.\u201d Letter from\nHannah A.

But there was\nno need for that court to remand the cases for factual\ndevelopment. GEICO\u2019s decision to issue no adverse action\nnotice to Edo was not a violation of \u00a71681m(a), and\nSafeco\u2019s misreading of the statute was not reckless. The\njudgments of the Court of Appeals are therefore reversed\nin both cases, which are remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 Respondent-plaintiffs argue that evidence of subjective bad faith\n\nmust be taken into account in determining whether a company acted\nknowingly or recklessly for purposes of \u00a71681n(a). To the extent that\nthey argue that evidence of subjective bad faith can support a willful\nness finding even when the company\u2019s reading of the statute is objec\ntively reasonable, their argument is unsound. Where, as here, the\nstatutory text and relevant court and agency guidance allow for more\nthan one reasonable interpretation, it would defy history and current\nthinking to treat a defendant who merely adopts one such interpreta\ntion as a knowing or reckless violator. Congress could not have in\ntended such a result for those who followed an interpretation that could\nreasonably have found support in the courts, whatever their subjective\nintent may have been.\n   Both Safeco and GEICO argue that good-faith reliance on legal\nadvice should render companies immune to claims raised under\n\u00a71681n(a). While we do not foreclose this possibility, we need not\naddress the issue here in light of our present holdings.\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

S. C. \u00a71681m(a). That is true even if the\ncompany would have made the same decision without\nlooking at the report, because what the company actually\ndid is more relevant than what it might have done. I find\nnothing in the statute making the examination of a credit\nreport a \u201cnecessary condition\u201d of any resulting increase.\nAnte, at 13. The more natural reading is that reviewing a\nreport is only a sufficient condition.\n   The Court\u2019s contrary position leads to a serious anom\n2             SAFECO INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. BURR\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\naly. As a matter of federal law, companies are free to\nadopt whatever \u201cneutral\u201d credit scores they want. That\nscore need not (and probably will not) reflect the median\nconsumer credit score. More likely, it will reflect a com\npany\u2019s assessment of the creditworthiness of a run-of-the\nmill applicant who lacks a credit report. Because those\nwho have yet to develop a credit history are unlikely to be\ngood credit risks, \u201cneutral\u201d credit scores will in many cases\nbe quite low. Yet under the Court\u2019s reasoning, only those\nconsumers with credit scores even lower than what may\nalready be a very low \u201cneutral\u201d score will ever receive\nadverse action notices.1\n  While the Court acknowledges that \u201cthe neutral-score\nbaseline will leave some consumers without a notice that\nmight lead to discovering errors,\u201d ante, at 16, it finds this\nunobjectionable because Congress was likely uninterested\nin \u201cthe theoretical question of whether the consumer\nwould have gotten a better rate with perfect credit.\u201d Ante,\nat 16.2 The Court\u2019s decision, however, disserves not only\nthose consumers with \u201cgilt-edged credit report[s],\u201d ante, at\n16, but also the much larger category of consumers with\nbetter-than-\u201cneutral\u201d scores. I find it difficult to believe\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Stranger still, companies that automatically disqualify consumers\n\nwho lack credit reports will never need to send any adverse action\nnotices. After all, the Court\u2019s baseline is \u201cwhat the applicant would\nhave had if the company had not taken his credit score into account,\u201d\nante, at 15, but from such companies, what the applicant \u201cwould have\nhad\u201d is no insurance at all. An offer of insurance at any price, however\ninflated by a poor and perhaps incorrect credit score, will therefore\nnever constitute an adverse action.\n   2 The Court also justifies its deviation from the statute\u2019s text by rea\n\nsoning that frequent adverse action notices would be ignored. See ante,\nat 16\u201317. To borrow a sentence from the Court\u2019s opinion: \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\nAnte, at 8. But rather than speculate about the likely effect of \u201chyper\nnotification,\u201d ante, at 17, I would defer to the Solicitor General\u2019s posi\ntion, informed by the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s expert judgment,\nthat consumers by and large benefit from adverse action notices,\nhowever common.

Anyone who \"willfully fails\" to provide notice is civilly liable to the consumer. \u00a7 1681n(a). The questions in these consolidated cases are whether willful failure covers a violation committed in reckless disregard of the notice obligation, and, if so, whether petitioners Safeco and GEICO committed reckless violations. We hold that reckless action is covered, that GEICO did not violate the statute, and that while Safeco might have, it did not act recklessly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Congress enacted FCRA in 1970 to ensure fair and accurate credit reporting, promote efficiency in the banking system, and protect consumer privacy. See 84 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2206</span> Stat. 1128, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681; <i>TRW Inc. v.

The Act requires, among other things, that \"any person [who] takes any adverse action with respect to any consumer that is based in whole or in part on any information contained in a consumer report\" must notify the affected consumer.<sup>[1]</sup> 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(a). The notice must point out the adverse action, explain how to reach the agency that reported on the consumer's credit, and tell the consumer that he can get a free copy of the report and dispute its accuracy with the agency. <i>Ibid.</i> As it applies to an insurance company, \"adverse action\" is \"a denial or cancellation of, an increase in any charge for, or a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or amount of, any insurance, existing or applied for.\" \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>FCRA provides a private right of action against businesses that use consumer reports but fail to comply. If a violation is negligent, the affected consumer is entitled to actual damages. \u00a7 1681<i>o</i>(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). If willful, however, the consumer may have actual damages, or statutory damages ranging from $100 to $1,000, and even punitive damages. \u00a7 1681n(a) (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioner GEICO<sup>[2]</sup> writes auto insurance through four subsidiaries: GEICO General, which sells \"preferred\" policies at low rates to low-risk customers; Government Employees, which also sells \"preferred\" policies, but only to government employees; GEICO Indemnity, which sells standard policies to moderate-risk customers; and GEICO Casualty, which sells nonstandard policies at higher rates to high-risk customers. Potential customers call a toll-free number answered by an agent of the four affiliates, who takes information and, with permission, gets the applicant's credit score.<sup>[3]</sup> This information goes into GEICO's computer system, which selects any appropriate company and the particular rate at which a policy may be issued.</p>\n<p>For some time after FCRA went into effect, GEICO sent adverse action notices to all applicants who were not offered \"preferred\" policies from GEICO General or Government Employees. GEICO changed its practice, however, after a method to \"neutralize\" an applicant's credit score was devised: the applicant's company and tier placement is compared with the company and tier placement he would have been assigned with a \"neutral\" credit score, that is, one calculated without reliance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2207</span> on credit history.<sup>[4]</sup> Under this new scheme, it is only if using a neutral credit score would have put the applicant in a lower priced tier or company that GEICO sends an adverse action notice; the applicant is not otherwise told if he would have gotten better terms with a better credit score.</p>\n<p>Respondent Ajene Edo applied for auto insurance with GEICO. After obtaining Edo's credit score, GEICO offered him a standard policy with GEICO Indemnity (at rates higher than the most favorable), which he accepted. Because Edo's company and tier placement would have been the same with a neutral score, GEICO did not give Edo an adverse action notice. Edo later filed this proposed class action against GEICO, alleging willful failure to give notice in violation of \u00a7 1681m(a); he claimed no actual harm, but sought statutory and punitive damages under \u00a7 1681n(a). The District Court granted summary judgment for GEICO, finding there was no adverse action when \"the premium charged to [Edo] ... would have been the same even if GEICO Indemnity did not consider information in [his] consumer credit history.\" <i>Edo v.

Safeco sent them no adverse action notices, and they later joined a proposed class action against the company, alleging willful violation of \u00a7 1681m(a) and seeking statutory and punitive damages under \u00a7 1681n(a). The District Court ordered summary judgment for Safeco, on the understanding that offering a single, initial rate for insurance cannot be \"adverse action.\"</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed both judgments. In GEICO's case, it held that whenever a consumer \"would have received a lower rate for his insurance had the information in his consumer report been more favorable, an adverse action has been taken against him.\" <i>Reynolds v.

Since a better credit score would have placed Edo with GEICO General, not GEICO Indemnity, the appeals court held that GEICO's failure to give notice was an adverse action.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit also held that an insurer \"willfully\" fails to comply with FCRA if it acts with \"reckless disregard\" of a consumer's rights under the Act. <i>Id.,</i> at 1099. It explained that a company would not be acting recklessly if it \"diligently and in good faith attempted to fulfill its statutory obligations\" and came to a \"tenable, albeit erroneous, interpretation of the statute.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The court went on to say that \"a deliberate failure to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2208</span> the extent of its obligations\" would not ordinarily escape liability under \u00a7 1681n, any more than \"reliance on creative lawyering that provides indefensible answers.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Because the court believed that the enquiry into GEICO's reckless disregard might turn on undisclosed circumstances surrounding GEICO's revision of its notification policy, the Court of Appeals remanded the company's case for further proceedings.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In the action against Safeco, the Court of Appeals rejected the District Court's position, relying on its reasoning in GEICO's case (where it had held that the notice requirement applies to a single statement of an initial charge for a new policy). <i>Spano v. Safeco Corp.,</i> 140 Fed. Appx. 746 (2005). The Court of Appeals also rejected Safeco's argument that its conduct was not willful, again citing the GEICO case, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>We consolidated the two matters and granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the Circuits as to whether \u00a7 1681n(a) reaches reckless disregard of FCRA's obligations,<sup>[8]</sup> and to clarify the notice requirement in \u00a7 1681m(a). 548 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 36, 165 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2006). We now reverse in both cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>GEICO and Safeco argue that liability under \u00a7 1681n(a) for \"willfully fail[ing] to comply\" with FCRA goes only to acts known to violate the Act, not to reckless disregard of statutory duty, but we think they are wrong. We have said before that \"willfully\" is a \"word of many meanings whose construction is often dependent on the context in which it appears,\" <i>Bryan v.

This construction reflects common law usage, which treated actions in \"reckless disregard\" of the law as \"willful\" violations. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7 34, p. 212 (5th ed.1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton) (\"Although efforts have been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2209</span> made to distinguish\" the terms \"willful,\" \"wanton,\" and \"reckless,\" \"such distinctions have consistently been ignored, and the three terms have been treated as meaning the same thing, or at least as coming out at the same legal exit\"). The standard civil usage thus counsels reading the phrase \"willfully fails to comply\" in \u00a7 1681n(a) as reaching reckless FCRA violations,<sup>[9]</sup> and this is so both on the interpretive assumption that Congress knows how we construe statutes and expects us to run true to form, see <i>Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112862\"><a href=\"/opinion/112862/commissioner-v-keystone-consol-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 159, 113 S.Ct. 2006, 124 L.Ed.2d 71 (1993), and under the general rule that a common law term in a statute comes with a common law meaning, absent anything pointing another way, <i>Beck v. Prupis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118360\"><a href=\"/opinion/118360/beck-v-prupis/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span>, 500-501, 120 S.Ct. 1608, 146 L.Ed.2d 561 (2000).</p>\n<p>GEICO and Safeco argue that Congress did point to something different in FCRA, by a drafting history of \u00a7 1681n(a) said to show that liability was supposed to attach only to knowing violations. The original version of the Senate bill that turned out as FCRA had two standards of liability to victims: grossly negligent violation (supporting actual damages) and willful violation (supporting actual, statutory, and punitive damages). S. 823, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 1 (1969). GEICO and Safeco argue that since a \"gross negligence\" standard is effectively the same as a \"reckless disregard\" standard, the original bill's \"willfulness\" standard must have meant a level of culpability higher than \"reckless disregard,\" or there would have been no requirement to show a different state of mind as a condition of the potentially much greater liability; thus, \"willfully fails to comply\" must have referred to a knowing violation. Although the gross negligence standard was reduced later in the legislative process to simple negligence (as it now appears in \u00a7 1681<i>o</i>), the provision for willful liability remains unchanged and so must require knowing action, just as it did originally in the draft of \u00a7 1681n.</p>\n<p>Perhaps. But Congress may have scaled the standard for actual damages down to simple negligence because it thought gross negligence, being like reckless action, was covered by willfulness. Because this alternative reading is possible, any inference from the drafting sequence is shaky, and certainly no match for the following clue in the text as finally adopted, which points to the traditional understanding of willfulness in the civil sphere.</p>\n<p>The phrase in question appears in the preamble sentence of \u00a7 1681n(a): \"Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2210</span> with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer ... .\" Then come the details, in paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B), spelling out two distinct measures of damages chargeable against the willful violator. As a general matter, the consumer may get either actual damages or \"damages of not less than $100 and not more than $1,000.\" \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(A). But where the offender is liable \"for obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose,\" the statute sets liability higher: \"actual damages ... or $1,000, whichever is greater.\" \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>If the companies were right that \"willfully\" limits liability under \u00a7 1681n(a) to knowing violations, the modifier \"knowingly\" in \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(B) would be superfluous and incongruous; it would have made no sense for Congress to condition the higher damages under \u00a7 1681n(a) on knowingly obtaining a report without a permissible purpose if the general threshold of any liability under the section were knowing misconduct. If, on the other hand, \"willfully\" covers both knowing and reckless disregard of the law, knowing violations are sensibly understood as a more serious subcategory of willful ones, and both the preamble and the subsection have distinct jobs to do. See <i>United States v. Menasche,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105289\"><a href=\"/opinion/105289/united-states-v-menasche/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, 538-539, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955) (\"`[G]ive effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute'\" (quoting <i>Montclair v. Ramsdell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90753\"><a href=\"/opinion/90753/montclair-v-ramsdell/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 152, 2 S.Ct. 391, 27 L.Ed. 431 (1883))).</p>\n<p>The companies make other textual and structural arguments for their view, but none is persuasive. Safeco thinks our reading would lead to the absurd result that one could, with reckless disregard, knowingly obtain a consumer report without a permissible purpose. But this is not so; action falling within the knowing subcategory does not simultaneously fall within the reckless alternative. Then both GEICO and Safeco argue that the reference to acting \"knowingly and willfully\" in FCRA's criminal enforcement provisions, \u00a7 1681q and \u00a7 1681r, indicates that \"willfully\" cannot include recklessness. But we are now on the criminal side of the law, where the paired modifiers are often found, see, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) (false statements to federal investigators); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1097(a) (embezzlement of student loan funds); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) (false statements in a passport application). As we said before, in the criminal law \"willfully\" typically narrows the otherwise sufficient intent, making the government prove something extra, in contrast to its civil-law usage, giving a plaintiff a choice of mental states to show in making a case for liability, see n. 9, <i>supra.</i> The vocabulary of the criminal side of FCRA is consequently beside the point in construing the civil side.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Before getting to the claims that the companies acted recklessly, we have the antecedent question whether either company violated the adverse action notice requirement at all. In both cases, respondent-plaintiffs' claims are premised on initial rates charged for new insurance policies, which are not \"adverse\" actions unless quoting or charging a first-time premium is \"an increase in any charge for... any insurance, existing or applied for.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>In Safeco's case, the District Court held that the initial rate for a new insurance policy cannot be an \"increase\" because there is no prior dealing. The phrase \"increase in any charge for ... insurance\" is readily understood to mean a change in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2211</span> treatment for an insured, which assumes a previous charge for comparison. See Webster's New International Dictionary 1260 (2d ed.1957) (defining \"increase\" as \"[a]ddition or enlargement in size, extent, quantity, number, intensity, value, substance, etc.; augmentation; growth; multiplication\"). Since the District Court understood \"increase\" to speak of change just as much as of comparative size or quantity, it reasoned that the statute's \"increase\" never touches the initial rate offer, where there is no change.</p>\n<p>The Government takes the part of the Court of Appeals in construing \"increase\" to reach a first-time rate. It says that regular usage of the term is not as narrow as the District Court thought: the point from which to measure difference can just as easily be understood without referring to prior individual dealing. The Government gives the example of a gas station owner who charges more than the posted price for gas to customers he doesn't like; it makes sense to say that the owner increases the price and that the driver pays an increased price, even if he never pulled in there for gas before. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 26.<sup>[10]</sup> The Government implies, then, that reading \"increase\" requires a choice, and the chosen reading should be the broad one in order to conform to what Congress had in mind.</p>\n<p>We think the Government's reading has the better fit with the ambitious objective set out in the Act's statement of purpose, which uses expansive terms to describe the adverse effects of unfair and inaccurate credit reporting and the responsibilities of consumer reporting agencies. See \u00a7 1681(a) (inaccurate reports \"directly impair the efficiency of the banking system\"; unfair reporting methods undermine public confidence \"essential to the continued functioning of the banking system\"; need to \"insure\" that reporting agencies \"exercise their grave responsibilities\" fairly, impartially, and with respect for privacy). The descriptions of systemic problem and systemic need as Congress saw them do nothing to suggest that remedies for consumers placed at a disadvantage by unsound credit ratings should be denied to first-time victims, and the legislative histories of FCRA's original enactment and of the 1996 amendment reveal no reason to confine attention to customers and businesses with prior dealings. Quite the contrary.<sup>[11]</sup> Finally, there is nothing about insurance contracts to suggest that Congress might have meant to differentiate applicants from existing customers when it set the notice requirement; the newly insured who gets charged more owing to an erroneous report is in the same boat with the renewal applicant.<sup>[12]</sup> We therefore <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2212</span> hold that the \"increase\" required for \"adverse action,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i), speaks to a disadvantageous rate even with no prior dealing; the term reaches initial rates for new applicants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Although offering the initial rate for new insurance can be an \"adverse action,\" respondent-plaintiffs have another hurdle to clear, for \u00a7 1681m(a) calls for notice only when the adverse action is \"based in whole or in part on\" a credit report. GEICO argues that in order to have adverse action \"based on\" a credit report, consideration of the report must be a necessary condition for the increased rate. The Government and respondent-plaintiffs do not explicitly take a position on this point.</p>\n<p>To the extent there is any disagreement on the issue, we accept GEICO's reading. In common talk, the phrase \"based on\" indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a necessary logical condition. Under this most natural reading of \u00a7 1681m(a), then, an increased rate is not \"based in whole or in part on\" the credit report unless the report was a necessary condition of the increase.</p>\n<p>As before, there are textual arguments pointing another way. The statute speaks in terms of basing the action \"in part\" as well as wholly on the credit report, and this phrasing could mean that adverse action is \"based on\" a credit report whenever the report was considered in the rate-setting process, even without being a necessary condition for the rate increase. But there are good reasons to think Congress preferred GEICO's necessary-condition reading.</p>\n<p>If the statute has any claim to lucidity, not all \"adverse actions\" require notice, only those \"based ... on\" information in a credit report. Since the statute does not explicitly call for notice when a business acts adversely merely after consulting a report, conditioning the requirement on action \"based ... on\" a report suggests that the duty to report arises from some practical consequence of reading the report, not merely some subsequent adverse occurrence that would have happened anyway. If the credit report has no identifiable effect on the rate, the consumer has no immediately practical reason to worry about it (unless he has the power to change every other fact that stands between himself and the best possible deal); both the company and the consumer are just where they would have been if the company had never seen the report.<sup>[13]</sup> And if examining reports that make no difference was supposed to trigger a reporting requirement, it would be hard to find any practical point in imposing the \"based ... on\" restriction. So it makes more sense to suspect that Congress meant to require notice and prompt a challenge by the consumer only when the consumer would gain something if the challenge succeeded.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2213</span> C</h2>\n<p>To sum up, the difference required for an increase can be understood without reference to prior dealing (allowing a first-time applicant to sue), and considering the credit report must be a necessary condition for the difference. The remaining step in determining a duty to notify in cases like these is identifying the benchmark for determining whether a first-time rate is a disadvantageous increase. And in dealing with this issue, the pragmatic reading of \"based ... on\" as a condition necessary to make a practical difference carries a helpful suggestion.</p>\n<p>The Government and respondent-plaintiffs argue that the baseline should be the rate that the applicant would have received with the best possible credit score, while GEICO contends it is what the applicant would have had if the company had not taken his credit score into account (the \"neutral score\" rate GEICO used in Edo's case). We think GEICO has the better position, primarily because its \"increase\" baseline is more comfortable with the understanding of causation just discussed, which requires notice under \u00a7 1681m(a) only when the effect of the credit report on the initial rate offered is necessary to put the consumer in a worse position than other relevant facts would have decreed anyway. If Congress was this concerned with practical consequences when it adopted a \"based ... on\" causation standard, it presumably thought in equally practical terms when it spoke of an \"increase\" that must be defined by a baseline to measure from. Congress was therefore more likely concerned with the practical question whether the consumer's rate actually suffered when the company took his credit report into account than the theoretical question whether the consumer would have gotten a better rate with perfect credit.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>The Government objects that this reading leaves a loophole, since it keeps first-time applicants who actually deserve better-than-neutral credit scores from getting notice, even when errors in credit reports saddle them with unfair rates. This is true; the neutral-score baseline will leave some consumers without a notice that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2214</span> might lead to discovering errors. But we do not know how often these cases will occur, whereas we see a more demonstrable and serious disadvantage inhering in the Government's position.</p>\n<p>Since the best rates (the Government's preferred baseline) presumably go only to a minority of consumers, adopting the Government's view would require insurers to send slews of adverse action notices; every young applicant who had yet to establish a gilt-edged credit report, for example, would get a notice that his charge had been \"increased\" based on his credit report. We think that the consequence of sending out notices on this scale would undercut the obvious policy behind the notice requirement, for notices as common as these would take on the character of formalities, and formalities tend to be ignored. It would get around that new insurance usually comes with an adverse action notice, owing to some legal quirk, and instead of piquing an applicant's interest about the accuracy of his credit record, the commonplace notices would mean just about nothing and go the way of junk mail. Assuming that Congress meant a notice of adverse action to get some attention, we think the cost of closing the loophole would be too high.</p>\n<p>While on the subject of hypernotification, we should add a word on another point of practical significance. Although the rate initially offered for new insurance is an \"increase\" calling for notice if it exceeds the neutral rate, did Congress intend the same baseline to apply if the quoted rate remains the same over a course of dealing, being repeated at each renewal date?</p>\n<p>We cannot believe so. Once a consumer has learned that his credit report led the insurer to charge more, he has no need to be told over again with each renewal if his rate has not changed. For that matter, any other construction would probably stretch the word \"increase\" more than it could bear. Once the gas station owner had charged the customer the above-market price, it would be strange to speak of the same price as an increase every time the customer pulled in. Once buyer and seller have begun a course of dealing, customary usage does demand a change for \"increase\" to make sense.<sup>[16]</sup> Thus, after initial dealing between the consumer and the insurer, the baseline for \"increase\" is the previous rate or charge, not the \"neutral\" baseline that applies at the start.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In GEICO's case, the initial rate offered to Edo was the one he would have received if his credit score had not been taken into account, and GEICO owed him no adverse action notice under \u00a7 1681m(a).<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2215</span> B</h2>\n<p>Safeco did not give Burr and Massey any notice because it thought \u00a7 1681m(a) did not apply to initial applications, a mistake that left the company in violation of the statute if Burr and Massey received higher rates \"based in whole or in part\" on their credit reports; if they did, Safeco would be liable to them on a showing of reckless conduct (or worse). The first issue we can forget, however, for although the record does not reliably indicate what rates they would have obtained if their credit reports had not been considered, it is clear enough that if Safeco did violate the statute, the company was not reckless in falling down in its duty.</p>\n<p>While \"the term recklessness is not self-defining,\" the common law has generally understood it in the sphere of civil liability as conduct violating an objective standard: action entailing \"an unjustifiably high risk of harm that is either known or so obvious that it should be known.\"<sup>[18]</sup><i>Farmer v. Brennan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span>, 836, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); see Prosser and Keeton \u00a7 34, at 213-214. The Restatement, for example, defines reckless disregard of a person's physical safety this way:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The actor's conduct is in reckless disregard of the safety of another if he does an act or intentionally fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do, knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize, not only that his conduct creates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another, but also that such risk is substantially greater than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 500, p. 587 (1963-1964).</blockquote>\n<p>It is this high risk of harm, objectively assessed, that is the essence of recklessness at common law. See Prosser and Keeton \u00a7 34, at 213 (recklessness requires \"a known or obvious risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow\").</p>\n<p>There being no indication that Congress had something different in mind, we have no reason to deviate from the common law understanding in applying the statute. See <i>Prupis,</i> 529 U.S., at 500-501, 120 S.Ct. 1608. Thus, a company subject to FCRA does not act in reckless disregard of it unless the action is not only a violation under a reasonable reading of the statute's terms, but shows that the company ran a risk of violating the law substantially greater than the risk associated with a reading that was merely careless.</p>\n<p>Here, there is no need to pinpoint the negligence/recklessness line, for Safeco's reading of the statute, albeit erroneous, was not objectively unreasonable. As we said, \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i) is silent on the point from which to measure \"increase.\" On the rationale that \"increase\" presupposes prior dealing, Safeco took the definition as excluding initial rate offers for new insurance, and so sent no adverse action notices to Burr and Massey. While we disagree with Safeco's analysis, we recognize <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2216</span> that its reading has a foundation in the statutory text, see <i>supra,</i> at ___ 11, and a sufficiently convincing justification to have persuaded the District Court to adopt it and rule in Safeco's favor.</p>\n<p>This is not a case in which the business subject to the Act had the benefit of guidance from the courts of appeals or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that might have warned it away from the view it took. Before these cases, no court of appeals had spoken on the issue, and no authoritative guidance has yet come from the FTC<sup>[19]</sup> (which in any case has only enforcement responsibility, not substantive rulemaking authority, for the provisions in question, see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681s(a)(1), (e)).

Given this dearth of guidance and the less-than-pellucid statutory text, Safeco's reading was not objectively unreasonable, and so falls well short of raising the \"unjustifiably high risk\" of violating the statute necessary for reckless liability.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals correctly held that reckless disregard of a requirement of FCRA would qualify as a willful violation within the meaning of \u00a7 1681n(a). But there was no need for that court to remand the cases for factual development. GEICO's decision to issue no adverse action notice to Edo was not a violation of \u00a7 1681m(a), and Safeco's misreading of the statute was not reckless. The judgments of the Court of Appeals are therefore reversed in both cases, which are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>While I join the Court's judgment and Parts I, II, III-A, and IV-B of the Court's opinion, I disagree with the reasoning in Parts III-B and III-C, as well as with Part IV-A, which relies on that reasoning.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2217</span> An adverse action taken after reviewing a credit report \"is based in whole or in part on\" that report within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(a). That is true even if the company would have made the same decision without looking at the report, because what the company actually did is more relevant than what it might have done. I find nothing in the statute making the examination of a credit report a \"necessary condition\" of any resulting increase. <i>Ante,</i> at 2211. The more natural reading is that reviewing a report is only a sufficient condition.</p>\n<p>The Court's contrary position leads to a serious anomaly. As a matter of federal law, companies are free to adopt whatever \"neutral\" credit scores they want. That score need not (and probably will not) reflect the median consumer credit score. More likely, it will reflect a company's assessment of the creditworthiness of a run-of-the-mill applicant who lacks a credit report. Because those who have yet to develop a credit history are unlikely to be good credit risks, \"neutral\" credit scores will in many cases be quite low. Yet under the Court's reasoning, only those consumers with credit scores even lower than what may already be a very low \"neutral\" score will ever receive adverse action notices.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>While the Court acknowledges that \"the neutral-score baseline will leave some consumers without a notice that might lead to discovering errors,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2213-2214, it finds this unobjectionable because Congress was likely uninterested in \"the theoretical question of whether the consumer would have gotten a better rate with perfect credit.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2213.<sup>[2]</sup> The Court's decision, however, disserves not only those consumers with \"gilt-edged credit report[s],\" <i>ante,</i> at 2214, but also the much larger category of consumers with better-than-\"neutral\" scores. I find it difficult to believe that Congress could have intended for a company's unrestrained adoption of a \"neutral\" score to keep many (if not most) consumers from ever hearing that their credit reports are costing them money. In my view, the statute's text is amenable to a more sensible interpretation.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice ALITO joins, concurring in part.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court's disposition and most of its reasoning. Safeco did not send notices to new customers because it took the position that the initial insurance rate it offered a customer could not be an \"increase in any charge for ... insurance\" under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i). The Court properly holds that regardless of the merits of this interpretation, it is not an unreasonable one, and Safeco therefore did not act willfully. <i>Ante,</i> at 2214-2216. I <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2218</span> do not join Part III-A of the Court's opinion, however, because it resolves the merits of Safeco's interpretation of \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i)\u0097an issue not necessary to the Court's conclusion and not briefed or argued by the parties.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Justice SCALIA joins all but footnotes 11 and 15 of this opinion.</p>\n<p>[1]  So far as it matters here, the Act defines \"consumer report\" as \"any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, [or] credit capacity ... which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer's eligibility for ... credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d)(1) (footnote omitted). The scope of this definition is not at issue.</p>\n<p>[2]  The specific petitioners are subsidiary companies of the GEICO Corporation; for the sake of convenience, we call them \"GEICO\" collectively.</p>\n<p>[3]  The Act defines a \"credit score\" as \"a numerical value or a categorization derived from a statistical tool or modeling system used by a person who makes or arranges a loan to predict the likelihood of certain credit behaviors, including default.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681g(f)(2)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). Under its contract with its credit information providers, GEICO learned credit scores and facts in the credit reports that significantly influenced the scores, but did not have access to the credit reports themselves.</p>\n<p>[4]  A number of States permit the use of such \"neutral\" credit scores to ensure that consumers with thin or unidentifiable credit histories are not treated disadvantageously. See, <i>e.g.,</i> N.Y. Ins. Law Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2802(e), (e)(1) (West 2006) (generally prohibiting an insurer from \"consider[ing] an absence of credit information,\" but allowing it to do so if it \"treats the consumer as if the applicant or insured had neutral credit information, as defined by the insurer\").</p>\n<p>[5]  Again, the actual petitioners are subsidiary companies, of Safeco Corporation in this case; for convenience, we call them \"Safeco\" collectively.</p>\n<p>[6]  The parties do not dispute that the credit scores and credit reports relied on by GEICO and Safeco are \"consumer reports\" under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d)(1).</p>\n<p>[7]  Prior to issuing its final opinion in this case, the Court of Appeals had issued, then withdrawn, two opinions in which it held that GEICO had \"willfully\" violated FCRA as a matter of law. <i>Reynolds v.

When the term \"willful\" or \"willfully\" has been used in a criminal statute, we have regularly read the modifier as limiting liability to knowing violations. See <i>Ratzlaf v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112919\"><a href=\"/opinion/112919/ratzlaf-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span>, 137, 114 S.Ct. 655, 126 L.Ed.2d 615 (1994); <i>Bryan v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118227\"><a href=\"/opinion/118227/bryan-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>, 191-192, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998); <i>Cheek v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112517\"><a href=\"/opinion/112517/cheek-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 200-201, 111 S.Ct. 604, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991). This reading of the term, however, is tailored to the criminal law, where it is characteristically used to require a criminal intent beyond the purpose otherwise required for guilt, <i>Ratzlaf, supra,</i> at 136-137, 114 S.Ct. 655; or an additional \"`bad purpose,'\" <i>Bryan, supra,</i> at 191, 118 S.Ct. 1939; or specific intent to violate a known legal duty created by highly technical statutes, <i>Cheek, supra,</i> at 200-201, 111 S.Ct. 604. Thus we have consistently held that a defendant cannot harbor such criminal intent unless he \"acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.\" <i>Bryan, supra,</i> at 193, 118 S.Ct. 1939. Civil use of the term, however, typically presents neither the textual nor the substantive reasons for pegging the threshold of liability at knowledge of wrongdoing. Cf. <i>Farmer v. Brennan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span>, 836-837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (contrasting the different uses of the term \"recklessness\" in civil and criminal contexts).</p>\n<p>[10]  Since the posted price seems to be addressed to the world in general, one could argue that the increased gas price is not the initial quote. But the same usage point can be made with the example of the clothing model who gets a call from a ritzy store after posing for a discount retailer. If she quotes a higher fee, it would be natural to say that the uptown store will have to pay the \"increase\" to have her in its ad.</p>\n<p>[11]  See S.Rep. No. 91-517, p. 7 (1969) (\"Those who ... charge a higher rate for credit or insurance wholly or partly because of a consumer report must, upon written request, so advise the consumer ...\"); S.Rep. No. 103-209, p. 4 (1993) (adverse action notice is required \"any time the permissible use of a report results in an outcome adverse to the interests of the consumer\"); H.R.Rep. No. 103-486, p. 26 (1994) (\"[W]henever a consumer report is obtained for a permissible purpose ..., any action taken based on that report that is adverse to the interests of the consumer triggers the adverse action notice requirements\").</p>\n<p>[12]  In fact, notice in the context of an initially offered rate may be of greater significance than notice in the context of a renewal rate; if, for instance, insurance is offered on the basis of a single, long-term guaranteed rate, a consumer who is not given notice during the initial application process may never have an opportunity to learn of any adverse treatment.</p>\n<p>[13]  For instance, if a consumer's driving record is so poor that no insurer would give him anything but the highest possible rate regardless of his credit report, whether or not an insurer happened to look at his credit report should have no bearing on whether the consumer must receive notice, since he has not been treated differently as a result of it.</p>\n<p>[14]  The history of the Act provides further support for this reading. The originally enacted version of the notice requirement stated: \"Whenever ... the charge for ... insurance is increased either wholly or partly because of information contained in a consumer report..., the user of the consumer report shall so advise the consumer ... .\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(a) (1976 ed.). The \"because of\" language in the original statute emphasized that the consumer report must actually have caused the adverse action for the notice requirement to apply. When Congress amended FCRA in 1996, it sought to define \"adverse action\" with greater particularity, and thus split the notice provision into two separate subsections. See 110 Stat. 3009-426 to 3009-427, 3009-443 to 3009-444. In the revised version of \u00a7 1681m(a), the original \"because of\" phrasing changed to \"based on,\" but there was no indication that this change was meant to be a substantive alteration of the statute's scope.</p>\n<p>[15]  While it might seem odd, under the current statutory structure, to interpret the definition of \"adverse action\" (in \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i)) in conjunction with \u00a7 1681m(a), which simply applies the notice requirement to a particular subset of \"adverse actions,\" there are strong indications that Congress intended these provisions to be construed in tandem. When FCRA was initially enacted, the link between the definition of \"adverse action\" and the notice requirement was clear, since \"adverse action\" was defined within \u00a7 1681m(a). See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(a) (1976 ed.). Though Congress eventually split the provision into two parts (with the definition of \"adverse action\" now located at \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i)), the legislative history suggests that this change was not meant to alter Congress's intent to define \"adverse action\" in light of the notice requirement. See S.Rep. No. 103-209, at 4 (\"The Committee bill ... defines an `adverse action' as any action that is adverse to the interests of the consumer and is based in whole or in part on a consumer report\"); H.R.Rep. No. 103-486, at 26 (\"[A]ny action based on [a consumer] report that is adverse to the interests of the consumer triggers the adverse action notice requirements\").</p>\n<p>[16]  Consider, too, a consumer who, at the initial application stage, had a perfect credit score and thus obtained the best insurance rate, but, at the renewal stage, was charged at a higher rate (but still lower than the rate he would have received had his credit report not been taken into account) solely because his credit score fell during the interim. Although the consumer clearly suffered an \"increase\" in his insurance rate that was \"based on\" his credit score, he would not be entitled to an adverse action notice under the baseline used for initial applications.</p>\n<p>[17]  We reject Edo's alternative argument that GEICO's offer of a standard insurance policy with GEICO Indemnity was an \"adverse action\" requiring notice because it amounted to a \"denial\" of insurance through a lower cost, \"preferred\" policy with GEICO General. See \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i) (defining \"adverse action\" to include a \"denial ... of ... insurance\"). An applicant calling GEICO for insurance talks with a sales representative who acts for all the GEICO companies. The record has no indication that GEICO tells applicants about its corporate structure, or that applicants request insurance from one of the several companies or even know of their separate existence. The salesperson takes information from the applicant and obtains his credit score, then either denies any insurance or assigns him to one of the companies willing to provide it; the other companies receive no application and take no separate action. This way of accepting new business is clearly outside the natural meaning of \"denial\" of insurance.</p>\n<p>[18]  Unlike civil recklessness, criminal recklessness also requires subjective knowledge on the part of the offender. <i>Brennan,</i> 511 U.S., at 836-837, 114 S.Ct. 1970; ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02(2)(c) (1985).</p>\n<p>[19]  Respondent-plaintiffs point to a letter, written by an FTC staff member to an insurance company lawyer, that suggests that an \"adverse action\" occurs when \"the applicant will have to pay more for insurance at the inception of the policy than he or she would have been charged if the consumer report had been more favorable.\" Letter from Hannah A. Stires to James M. Ball (Mar. 1, 2000), http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcra/ball.htm (as visited May 17, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). But the letter did not canvas the issue, and it explicitly indicated that it was merely \"an informal staff opinion ... not binding on the Commission.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>[20]  Respondent-plaintiffs argue that evidence of subjective bad faith must be taken into account in determining whether a company acted knowingly or recklessly for purposes of \u00a7 1681n(a). To the extent that they argue that evidence of subjective bad faith can support a willfulness finding even when the company's reading of the statute is objectively reasonable, their argument is unsound. Where, as here, the statutory text and relevant court and agency guidance allow for more than one reasonable interpretation, it would defy history and current thinking to treat a defendant who merely adopts one such interpretation as a knowing or reckless violator. Congress could not have intended such a result for those who followed an interpretation that could reasonably have found support in the courts, whatever their subjective intent may have been.\n</p>\n<p>Both Safeco and GEICO argue that good-faith reliance on legal advice should render companies immune to claims raised under \u00a7 1681n(a). While we do not foreclose this possibility, we need not address the issue here in light of our present holdings.</p>\n<p>[1]  Stranger still, companies that automatically disqualify consumers who lack credit reports will never need to send any adverse action notices. After all, the Court's baseline is \"what the applicant would have had if the company had not taken his credit score into account,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2213, but from such companies, what the applicant \"would have had\" is no insurance at all. An offer of insurance at <i>any</i> price, however inflated by a poor and perhaps incorrect credit score, will therefore never constitute an adverse action.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court also justifies its deviation from the statute's text by reasoning that frequent adverse action notices would be ignored. See <i>ante,</i> at 2213-2214. To borrow a sentence from the Court's opinion: \"Perhaps.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2209. But rather than speculate about the likely effect of \"hypernotification,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2214, I would defer to the Solicitor General's position, informed by the Federal Trade Commission's expert judgment, that consumers by and large benefit from adverse action notices, however common. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27-29.</p>\n\n</div>",
