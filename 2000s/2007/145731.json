They had sought review related to concerns they had over whether their youngest child, 6-year-old Jacob, would progress well at Pleasant Valley Elementary School, which is part of the Parma City School District in Parma, Ohio.</p>\n<p>Jacob has autism spectrum disorder and is covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Act or IDEA), 84 Stat. 175, as amended, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). His parents worked with the school district to develop an individualized education program (IEP), as required by the Act. All concede that Jacob's parents had the statutory right to contribute to this process and, when agreement could not be reached, to participate in administrative proceedings including what the Act refers to as an \"impartial due process hearing.\" \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>The disagreement at the center of the current dispute concerns the procedures to be followed when parents and their child, dissatisfied with the outcome of the due process hearing, seek further review in a United States District Court. The question is whether parents, either on their own behalf or as representatives of the child, may proceed in court unrepresented by counsel though they are not trained or licensed as attorneys. Resolution of this issue requires us to examine and explain the provisions of IDEA to determine if it accords to parents rights of their own that can be vindicated in court proceedings, or alternatively, whether the Act allows them, in their status as parents, to represent their child in court proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Respondent Parma City School District, a participant in IDEA's educational spending program, accepts federal funds for assistance in the education of children with disabilities. As a condition of receiving funds, it must comply with IDEA's mandates. IDEA requires that the school district provide Jacob with a \"free appropriate public education,\" which must operate in accordance with the IEP that Jacob's parents, along with school officials and other individuals, develop as members of Jacob's \"IEP Team.\" Brief for Petitioners 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The school district proposed an IEP for the 2003-2004 school year that would have placed Jacob at a public elementary school. Regarding this IEP as deficient under IDEA, Jacob's nonlawyer parents availed themselves of the administrative review provided by IDEA. They filed a complaint alleging respondent had failed to provide Jacob with a free appropriate public education; they appealed the hearing officer's rejection of the claims in this complaint to a state-level review officer; and after losing that appeal they filed, on their own behalf and on behalf of Jacob, a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In reliance upon 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) they challenged the administrative decision, alleging, among other matters: that Jacob had not been provided with a free appropriate public education; that his IEP was inadequate; and that the school district had failed to follow procedures mandated by IDEA. Pending the resolution of these challenges, the Winkelmans had enrolled Jacob in a private school at their own expense. They had also obtained counsel to assist them with certain aspects of the proceedings, although they filed their federal complaint, and later their appeal, without the aid of an attorney. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1999</span> Winkelmans' complaint sought reversal of the administrative decision, reimbursement for private-school expenditures and attorney's fees already incurred, and, it appears, declaratory relief.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted respondent's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding it had provided Jacob with a free appropriate public education. Petitioners, proceeding without counsel, filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Relying on its recent decision in <i>Cavanaugh v. Cardinal Local School Dist.,</i> 409 F.3d 753 (2005), the Court of Appeals entered an order dismissing the Winkelmans' appeal unless they obtained counsel to represent Jacob. See Order in No. 05-3886 (Nov. 4, 2005), App. A to Pet. for Cert. 1a. In <i>Cavanaugh</i> the Court of Appeals had rejected the proposition that IDEA allows nonlawyer parents raising IDEA claims to proceed <i>pro se</i> in federal court. The court ruled that the right to a free appropriate public education \"belongs to the child alone,\" 409 F.3d, at 757, not to both the parents and the child. It followed, the court held, that \"any right on which the [parents] could proceed on their own behalf would be derivative\" of the child's right, <i>ibid.,</i> so that parents bringing IDEA claims were not appearing on their own behalf, <i>ibid.</i> See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654 (allowing parties to prosecute their own claims <i>pro se</i>). As for the parents' alternative argument, the court held, nonlawyer parents cannot litigate IDEA claims on behalf of their child because IDEA does not abrogate the common-law rule prohibiting nonlawyer parents from representing minor children. 409 F.3d, at 756. As the court in <i>Cavanaugh</i> acknowledged, its decision brought the Sixth Circuit in direct conflict with the First Circuit, which had concluded, under a theory of \"statutory joint rights,\" that the Act accords to parents the right to assert IDEA claims on their own behalf. See <i>Maroni v. Pemi-Baker Regional School Dist.,</i> 346 F.3d 247, 249, 250 (C.A.1 2003).</p>\n<p>Petitioners sought review in this Court. In light of the disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to whether a nonlawyer parent of a child with a disability may prosecute IDEA actions <i>pro se</i> in federal court, we granted certiorari. 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1209, 166 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2006). Compare <i>Cavanaugh, supra,</i> with <i>Maroni, supra</i><i>;</i> see also <i>Mosely v. Board of Ed. of Chicago,</i> 434 F.3d 527 (C.A.7 2006); <i>Collinsgru v. Palmyra Bd. of Ed.,</i> 161 F.3d 225 (C.A.3 1998); <i>Wenger v. Canastota Central School Dist.,</i> 146 F.3d 123 (C.A.2 1998) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Devine v. Indian River Cty. School Bd.,</i> 121 F.3d 576 (C.A.11 1997).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Our resolution of this case turns upon the significance of IDEA's interlocking statutory provisions. Petitioners' primary theory is that the Act makes parents real parties in interest to IDEA actions, not \"mer[e] guardians of their children's rights.\" Brief for Petitioners 16. If correct, this allows Mr. and Mrs. Winkelman back into court, for there is no question that a party may represent his or her own interests in federal court without the aid of counsel. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654 (\"In all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel ...\"). Petitioners cannot cite a specific provision in IDEA mandating in direct and explicit terms that parents have the status of real parties in interest. They instead base their argument on a comprehensive reading of IDEA. Taken as a whole, they contend, the Act leads to the necessary conclusion that parents have independent, enforceable rights. Brief for Petitioners 14 (citing <i>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc. v. Nigh,</i> 543 U.S. 50, 60, 125 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2000</span> 460, 160 L.Ed.2d 389 (2004)). Respondent, accusing petitioners of \"knit[ting] together various provisions pulled from the crevices of the statute\" to support these claims, Brief for Respondent 19, reads the text of IDEA to mean that any redressable rights under the Act belong only to children, <i>id.,</i> at 19-40.</p>\n<p>We agree that the text of IDEA resolves the question presented. We recognize, in addition, that a proper interpretation of the Act requires a consideration of the entire statutory scheme. See <i>Dolan v. Postal Service,</i> 546 U.S. 481, 486, 126 S.Ct. 1252, 163 L.Ed.2d 1079 (2006). Turning to the current version of IDEA, which the parties agree governs this case, we begin with an overview of the relevant statutory provisions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The goals of IDEA include \"ensur[ing] that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education\" and \"ensur[ing] that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A)-(B) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). To this end, the Act includes provisions governing four areas of particular relevance to the Winkelmans' claim: procedures to be followed when developing a child's IEP; criteria governing the sufficiency of an education provided to a child; mechanisms for review that must be made available when there are objections to the IEP or to other aspects of IDEA proceedings; and the requirement in certain circumstances that States reimburse parents for various expenses. See generally \u00a7\u00a7 1412(a)(10), 1414, 1415. Although our discussion of these four areas does not identify all the illustrative provisions, we do take particular note of certain terms that mandate or otherwise describe parental involvement.</p>\n<p>IDEA requires school districts to develop an IEP for each child with a disability, see \u00a7\u00a7 1412(a)(4), 1414(d), with parents playing \"a significant role\" in this process, <i>Schaffer v. Weast,</i> 546 U.S. 49, 53, 126 S.Ct. 528, 163 L.Ed.2d 387 (2005). Parents serve as members of the team that develops the IEP. \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(B). The \"concerns\" parents have \"for enhancing the education of their child\" must be considered by the team. \u00a7 1414(d)(3)(A)(ii). IDEA accords parents additional protections that apply throughout the IEP process. See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1414(d)(4)(A) (requiring the IEP Team to revise the IEP when appropriate to address certain information provided by the parents); \u00a7 1414(e) (requiring States to \"ensure that the parents of [a child with a disability] are members of any group that makes decisions on the educational placement of their child\"). The statute also sets up general procedural safeguards that protect the informed involvement of parents in the development of an education for their child. See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1415(a) (requiring States to \"establish and maintain procedures ... to ensure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education\"); \u00a7 1415(b)(1) (mandating that States provide an opportunity for parents to examine all relevant records). See generally \u00a7\u00a7 1414, 1415. A central purpose of the parental protections is to facilitate the provision of a \"`free appropriate public education,'\" \u00a7 1401(9), which must be made available to the child \"in conformity with the [IEP],\" \u00a7 1401(9)(D).</p>\n<p>The Act defines a \"free appropriate public education\" pursuant to an IEP to be an educational instruction \"specially designed... to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability,\" \u00a7 1401(29), coupled with any additional \"`related services'\" that are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2001</span> \"required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from [that instruction],\" \u00a7 1401(26)(A). See also \u00a7 1401(9). The education must, among other things, be provided \"under public supervision and direction,\" \"meet the standards of the State educational agency,\" and \"include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school education in the State involved.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The instruction must, in addition, be provided at \"no cost to parents.\" \u00a7 1401(29). See generally <i>Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. 176, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982) (discussing the meaning of \"free appropriate public education\" as used in the statutory precursor to IDEA).</p>\n<p>When a party objects to the adequacy of the education provided, the construction of the IEP, or some related matter, IDEA provides procedural recourse: It requires that a State provide \"[a]n opportunity for any party to present a complaint ... with respect to any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.\" \u00a7 1415(b)(6). By presenting a complaint a party is able to pursue a process of review that, as relevant, begins with a preliminary meeting \"where the parents of the child discuss their complaint\" and the local educational agency \"is provided the opportunity to [reach a resolution].\" \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i)(IV). If the agency \"has not resolved the complaint to the satisfaction of the parents within 30 days,\" \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(ii), the parents may request an \"impartial due process hearing,\" \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(A), which must be conducted either by the local educational agency or by the state educational agency, <i>ibid.,</i> and where a hearing officer will resolve issues raised in the complaint, \u00a7 1415(f)(3).</p>\n<p>IDEA sets standards the States must follow in conducting these hearings. Among other things, it indicates that the hearing officer's decision \"shall be made on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education,\" and that, \"[i]n matters alleging a procedural violation,\" the officer may find a child \"did not receive a free appropriate public education\" only if the violation</p>\n<blockquote>\"(I) impeded the child's right to a free appropriate public education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(II) significantly impeded the parents' opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process regarding the provision of a free appropriate public education to the parents' child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(III) caused a deprivation of educational benefits.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(i)-(ii).</blockquote>\n<p>If the local educational agency, rather than the state educational agency, conducts this hearing, then \"any party aggrieved by the findings and decision rendered in such a hearing may appeal such findings and decision to the State educational agency.\" \u00a7 1415(g)(1). Once the state educational agency has reached its decision, an aggrieved party may commence suit in federal court: \"Any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made [by the hearing officer] shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint.\" \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A); see also \u00a7 1415(i)(1).</p>\n<p>IDEA, finally, provides for at least two means of cost recovery that inform our analysis. First, in certain circumstances it allows a court or hearing officer to require a state agency \"to reimburse the parents [of a child with a disability] for the cost of [private school] enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child.\" \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). Second, it sets forth rules governing when and to what extent a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2002</span> court may award attorney's fees. See \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B). Included in this section is a provision allowing an award \"to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.\" \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(I).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioners construe these various provisions to accord parents independent, enforceable rights under IDEA. We agree. The parents enjoy enforceable rights at the administrative stage, and it would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme to bar them from continuing to assert these rights in federal court.</p>\n<p>The statute sets forth procedures for resolving disputes in a manner that, in the Act's express terms, contemplates parents will be the parties bringing the administrative complaints. In addition to the provisions we have cited, we refer also to \u00a7 1415(b)(8) (requiring a state educational agency to \"develop a model form to assist parents in filing a complaint\"); \u00a7 1415(c)(2) (addressing the response an agency must provide to a \"parent's due process complaint notice\"); and \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i) (referring to \"the parent's complaint\"). A wide range of review is available: Administrative complaints may be brought with respect to \"any matter relating to ... the provision of a free appropriate public education.\" \u00a7 1415(b)(6)(A). Claims raised in these complaints are then resolved at impartial due process hearings, where, again, the statute makes clear that parents will be participating as parties. See generally <i>supra,</i> at 2001. See also \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(C) (indicating \"[a] parent or agency shall request an impartial due process hearing\" within a certain period of time); \u00a7 1415(e)(2)(A)(ii) (referring to \"a parent's right to a due process hearing\"). The statute then grants \"[a]ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision made [by the hearing officer] ... the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint.\" \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>Nothing in these interlocking provisions excludes a parent who has exercised his or her own rights from statutory protection the moment the administrative proceedings end. Put another way, the Act does not <i>sub silentio</i> or by implication bar parents from seeking to vindicate the rights accorded to them once the time comes to file a civil action. Through its provisions for expansive review and extensive parental involvement, the statute leads to just the opposite result.</p>\n<p>Respondent, resisting this line of analysis, asks us to read these provisions as contemplating parental involvement only to the extent parents represent their child's interests. In respondent's view IDEA accords parents nothing more than \"collateral tools related to the child's underlying substantive rights \u0097 not freestanding or independently enforceable rights.\" Brief for Respondent 25.</p>\n<p>This interpretation, though, is foreclosed by provisions of the statute. IDEA defines one of its purposes as seeking \"to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\" \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(B). The word \"rights\" in the quoted language refers to the rights of parents as well as the rights of the child; otherwise the grammatical structure would make no sense.</p>\n<p>Further provisions confirm this view. IDEA mandates that educational agencies establish procedures \"to ensure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education.\" \u00a7 1415(a). It presumes parents have rights of their own when it defines how States might provide for the transfer of the \"rights accorded to parents\" by IDEA, \u00a7 1415(m)(1)(B), and it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2003</span> prohibits the raising of certain challenges \"[n]otwithstanding any other individual right of action that a parent or student may maintain under [the relevant provisions of IDEA],\" \u00a7\u00a7 1401(10)(E), 1412(a)(14)(E). To adopt respondent's reading of the statute would require an interpretation of these statutory provisions (and others) far too strained to be correct.</p>\n<p>Defending its countertextual reading of the statute, respondent cites a decision by a Court of Appeals concluding that the Act's \"references to parents are best understood as accommodations to the fact of the child's incapacity.\" <i>Doe v. Board of Ed. of Baltimore Cty.,</i> 165 F.3d 260, 263 (C.A.4 1998); see also Brief for Respondent 30. This, according to respondent, requires us to interpret all references to parents' rights as referring in implicit terms to the child's rights \u0097 which, under this view, are the only enforceable rights accorded by IDEA. Even if we were inclined to ignore the plain text of the statute in considering this theory, we disagree that the sole purpose driving IDEA's involvement of parents is to facilitate vindication of a child's rights. It is not a novel proposition to say that parents have a recognized legal interest in the education and upbringing of their child. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Pierce v. Society of Sisters,</i> 268 U.S. 510, 534-535, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) (acknowledging \"the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control\"); <i>Meyer v. Nebraska,</i> 262 U.S. 390, 399-401, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923). There is no necessary bar or obstacle in the law, then, to finding an intention by Congress to grant parents a stake in the entitlements created by IDEA. Without question a parent of a child with a disability has a particular and personal interest in fulfilling \"our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.\" \u00a7 1400(c)(1).</p>\n<p>We therefore find no reason to read into the plain language of the statute an implicit rejection of the notion that Congress would accord parents independent, enforceable rights concerning the education of their children. We instead interpret the statute's references to parents' rights to mean what they say: that IDEA includes provisions conveying rights to parents as well as to children.</p>\n<p>A variation on respondent's argument has persuaded some Courts of Appeals. The argument is that while a parent can be a \"party aggrieved\" for aspects of the hearing officer's findings and decision, he or she cannot be a \"party aggrieved\" with respect to all IDEA-based challenges. Under this view the causes of action available to a parent might relate, for example, to various procedural mandates, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Collinsgru,</i> 161 F.3d, at 233, and reimbursement demands, see, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). The argument supporting this conclusion proceeds as follows: Because a \"party aggrieved\" is, by definition, entitled to a remedy, and parents are, under IDEA, only entitled to certain procedures and reimbursements as remedies, a parent cannot be a \"party aggrieved\" with regard to any claim not implicating these limited matters.</p>\n<p>This argument is contradicted by the statutory provisions we have recited. True, there are provisions in IDEA stating parents are entitled to certain procedural protections and reimbursements; but the statute prevents us from placing too much weight on the implications to be drawn when other entitlements are accorded in less clear language. We find little support for the inference that parents are excluded by implication whenever a child is mentioned, and vice versa. Compare, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1411(e)(3)(E) (barring States from using <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2004</span> certain funds for costs associated with actions \"brought on behalf of a child\" but failing to acknowledge that actions might also be brought on behalf of a parent) with \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i) (allowing recovery of attorney's fees to a \"prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability\" but failing to acknowledge that a child might also be a prevailing party). Without more, then, the language in IDEA confirming that parents enjoy particular procedural and reimbursement-related rights does not resolve whether they are also entitled to enforce IDEA's other mandates, including the one most fundamental to the Act: the provision of a free appropriate public education to a child with a disability.</p>\n<p>We consider the statutory structure. The IEP proceedings entitle parents to participate not only in the implementation of IDEA's procedures but also in the substantive formulation of their child's educational program. Among other things, IDEA requires the IEP Team, which includes the parents as members, to take into account any \"concerns\" parents have \"for enhancing the education of their child\" when it formulates the IEP. \u00a7 1414(d)(3)(A)(ii). The IEP, in turn, sets the boundaries of the central entitlement provided by IDEA: It defines a \"`free appropriate public education'\" for that parent's child. \u00a7 1401(9).</p>\n<p>The statute also empowers parents to bring challenges based on a broad range of issues. The parent may seek a hearing on \"any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.\" \u00a7 1415(b)(6)(A). To resolve these challenges a hearing officer must make a decision based on whether the child \"received a free appropriate public education.\" \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E). When this hearing has been conducted by a local educational agency rather than a state educational agency, \"any party aggrieved by the findings and decision rendered in such a hearing may appeal such findings and decision\" to the state educational agency. \u00a7 1415(g)(1). Judicial review follows, authorized by a broadly worded provision phrased in the same terms used to describe the prior stage of review: \"[a]ny party aggrieved\" may bring \"a civil action.\" \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>These provisions confirm that IDEA, through its text and structure, creates in parents an independent stake not only in the procedures and costs implicated by this process but also in the substantive decisions to be made. We therefore conclude that IDEA does not differentiate, through isolated references to various procedures and remedies, between the rights accorded to children and the rights accorded to parents. As a consequence, a parent may be a \"party aggrieved\" for purposes of \u00a7 1415(i)(2) with regard to \"any matter\" implicating these rights. See \u00a7 1415(b)(6)(A). The status of parents as parties is not limited to matters that relate to procedure and cost recovery. To find otherwise would be inconsistent with the collaborative framework and expansive system of review established by the Act. Cf. <i>Cedar Rapids Community School Dist. v. Garret F.,</i> 526 U.S. 66, 73, 119 S.Ct. 992, 143 L.Ed.2d 154 (1999) (looking to IDEA's \"overall statutory scheme\" to interpret its provisions).</p>\n<p>Our conclusion is confirmed by noting the incongruous results that would follow were we to accept the proposition that parents' IDEA rights are limited to certain nonsubstantive matters. The statute's procedural and reimbursement-related rights are intertwined with the substantive adequacy of the education provided to a child, see, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E), see also \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii), and it is difficult to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2005</span> disentangle the provisions in order to conclude that some rights adhere to both parent and child while others do not. Were we nevertheless to recognize a distinction of this sort it would impose upon parties a confusing and onerous legal regime, one worsened by the absence of any express guidance in IDEA concerning how a court might in practice differentiate between these matters. It is, in addition, out of accord with the statute's design to interpret the Act to require that parents prove the substantive inadequacy of their child's education as a predicate for obtaining, for example, reimbursement under \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii), yet to prevent them from obtaining a judgment mandating that the school district provide their child with an educational program demonstrated to be an appropriate one. The adequacy of the educational program is, after all, the central issue in the litigation. The provisions of IDEA do not set forth these distinctions, and we decline to infer them.</p>\n<p>The bifurcated regime suggested by the courts that have employed it, moreover, leaves some parents without a remedy. The statute requires, in express terms, that States provide a child with a free appropriate public education \"at public expense,\" \u00a7 1401(9)(A), including specially designed instruction \"at no cost to parents,\" \u00a7 1401(29). Parents may seek to enforce this mandate through the federal courts, we conclude, because among the rights they enjoy is the right to a free appropriate public education for their child. Under the countervailing view, which would make a parent's ability to enforce IDEA dependant on certain procedural and reimbursement-related rights, a parent whose disabled child has not received a free appropriate public education would have recourse in the federal courts only under two circumstances: when the parent happens to have some claim related to the procedures employed; and when he or she is able to incur, and has in fact incurred, expenses creating a right to reimbursement. Otherwise the adequacy of the child's education would not be regarded as relevant to any cause of action the parent might bring; and, as a result, only the child could vindicate the right accorded by IDEA to a free appropriate public education.</p>\n<p>The potential for injustice in this result is apparent. What is more, we find nothing in the statute to indicate that when Congress required States to provide adequate instruction to a child \"at no cost to parents,\" it intended that only some parents would be able to enforce that mandate. The statute instead takes pains to \"ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\" \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(B). See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1415(e)(2) (requiring that States implement procedures to ensure parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education); \u00a7 1415(e)(2)(A)(ii) (requiring that mediation procedures not be \"used to deny or delay a parent's right to a due process hearing ... or to deny any other rights afforded under this subchapter\"); cf. \u00a7 1400(c)(3) (noting IDEA's success in \"ensuring children with disabilities and the families of such children access to a free appropriate public education\").</p>\n<p>We conclude IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights. These rights, which are not limited to certain procedural and reimbursement-related matters, encompass the entitlement to a free appropriate public education for the parents' child.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Respondent contends, though, that even under the reasoning we have now explained petitioners cannot prevail without <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2006</span> overcoming a further difficulty. Citing our opinion in <i>Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy,</i> 548 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2455, 165 L.Ed.2d 526 (2006), respondent argues that statutes passed pursuant to the Spending Clause, such as IDEA, must provide \"`clear notice'\" before they can burden a State with some new condition, obligation, or liability. Brief for Respondent 41. Respondent contends that because IDEA is, at best, ambiguous as to whether it accords parents independent rights, it has failed to provide clear notice of this condition to the States. See <i>id.,</i> at 40-49.</p>\n<p>Respondent's reliance on <i>Arlington</i> is misplaced. In <i>Arlington</i> we addressed whether IDEA required States to reimburse experts' fees to prevailing parties in IDEA actions. \"[W]hen Congress attaches conditions to a State's acceptance of federal funds,\" we explained, \"the conditions must be set out `unambiguously.'\" 548 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2459 (quoting <i>Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman,</i> 451 U.S. 1, 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981)). The question to be answered in <i>Arlington,</i> therefore, was whether IDEA \"furnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue.\" 548 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2459. We found it did not.</p>\n<p>The instant case presents a different issue, one that does not invoke the same rule. Our determination that IDEA grants to parents independent, enforceable rights does not impose any substantive condition or obligation on States they would not otherwise be required by law to observe. The basic measure of monetary recovery, moreover, is not expanded by recognizing that some rights repose in both the parent and the child. Were we considering a statute other than the one before us, the Spending Clause argument might have more force: A determination by the Court that some distinct class of people has independent, enforceable rights might result in a change to the States' statutory obligations. But that is not the case here.</p>\n<p>Respondent argues our ruling will, as a practical matter, increase costs borne by the States as they are forced to defend against suits unconstrained by attorneys trained in the law and the rules of ethics. Effects such as these do not suffice to invoke the concerns under the Spending Clause. Furthermore, IDEA does afford relief for the States in certain cases. The Act empowers courts to award attorney's fees to a prevailing educational agency whenever a parent has presented a \"complaint or subsequent cause of action ... for any improper purpose, such as to harass, to cause unnecessary delay, or to needlessly increase the cost of litigation.\" \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(III). This provision allows some relief when a party has proceeded in violation of these standards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals erred when it dismissed the Winkelmans' appeal for lack of counsel. Parents enjoy rights under IDEA; and they are, as a result, entitled to prosecute IDEA claims on their own behalf. The decision by Congress to grant parents these rights was consistent with the purpose of IDEA and fully in accord with our social and legal traditions. It is beyond dispute that the relationship between a parent and child is sufficient to support a legally cognizable interest in the education of one's child; and, what is more, Congress has found that \"the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by ... strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2007</span> in the education of their children at school and at home.\" \u00a7 1400(c)(5).</p>\n<p>In light of our holding we need not reach petitioners' alternative argument, which concerns whether IDEA entitles parents to litigate their child's claims <i>pro se.</i></p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I would hold that parents have the right to proceed <i>pro se</i> under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), when they seek reimbursement for private school expenses or redress for violations of their own procedural rights, but not when they seek a judicial determination that their child's free appropriate public education (or FAPE) is substantively inadequate.</p>\n<p>Whether parents may bring suits under the IDEA without a lawyer depends upon the interaction between the IDEA and the general <i>pro se</i> provision in the Judiciary Act of 1789. The latter, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654, provides that \"[i]n all courts of the United States <i>the parties</i> may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel.\" (Emphasis added.) The IDEA's right-to-sue provision, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), provides that \"[a]ny <i>party aggrieved</i> by the findings and decision [of a hearing officer] shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the [administrative] complaint.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, when parents are \"parties aggrieved\" under the IDEA, they are \"parties\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654, entitled to sue on their own behalf.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>As both parties agree, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; Brief for Respondent 37, \"party aggrieved\" means \"[a] party entitled to a remedy; esp., a party whose personal, pecuniary, or property rights have been adversely affected by another person's actions or by a court's decree or judgment,\" Black's Law Dictionary 1154 (8th ed.2004); see also <i>ante,</i> at 2003-2004. This case thus turns on the rights that the IDEA accords to parents, and the concomitant remedies made available to them. Only with respect to such rights and remedies are parents properly viewed as \"parties aggrieved,\" capable of filing their own cases in federal court.</p>\n<p>A review of the statutory text makes clear that, as relevant here, the IDEA grants parents only two types of rights.<sup>[2]</sup> First, under certain circumstances \"a court or a hearing officer may require the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2008</span> [school district] to reimburse <i>the parents</i>\" for private school expenditures \"if the court or hearing officer finds that the [school district] had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added). Second, parents are accorded a variety of procedural protections, both during the development of their child's individualized education program (IEP), see, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(B)(i) (parents are members of their child's IEP team); \u00a7 1415(b)(1) (parents must have an opportunity to examine records and participate in IEP meetings), and in any subsequent administrative challenges, see, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7\u00a7 1415(b)(6), (8) (parents may file administrative due process complaints). It is clear that parents may object to procedural violations at the administrative due process hearing, see \u00a7 1415(b)(6)(A), and that a hearing officer may provide relief to parents for certain procedural infractions, see \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii). Because the rights to reimbursement and to the various procedural protections are accorded to parents themselves, they are \"parties aggrieved\" when those rights are infringed, and may accordingly proceed <i>pro se</i> when seeking to vindicate them.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court goes further, however, concluding that parents may proceed <i>pro se</i> not only when they seek reimbursement or assert procedural violations, but also when they challenge the substantive adequacy of their child's FAPE \u0097 so that parents may act without a lawyer <i>in every IDEA case.</i> See <i>ante,</i> at 2003-2006. In my view, this sweeps far more broadly than the text allows. Out of this sprawling statute the Court cannot identify even <i>a single</i> provision stating that parents have the substantive right to a FAPE. The reason for this is readily understandable: The right to a free appropriate public education obviously inheres in the child, for it is he who receives the education. As the IDEA instructs, participating States must provide a \"free appropriate public education ... to all children with disabilities ....\" \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The statute is replete with references to the fact that a FAPE belongs to the child. See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A) (IDEA designed \"to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education\"); \u00a7 1408(a)(2)(C)(i) (referring to \"the right of a child\" to \"receive a free appropriate public education\"); \u00a7 1411(e)(3)(F)(i) (same); \u00a7 1414(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) (referring to an agency \"that is responsible for making a free appropriate public education available to a child\"); \u00a7 1415(b)(6)(A) (referring to \"the provision of a free appropriate public education to [a] child\"). The parents of a disabled child no doubt have an <i>interest</i> in seeing their child receive a proper education. But there is a difference between an <i>interest</i> and a statutory <i>right.</i> The text of the IDEA makes clear that parents have no <i>right</i> to the education itself.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2009</span> The Court concedes, as it must, that while the IDEA gives parents the right to reimbursement and procedural protection in explicit terms, it does not do so for the supposed right to the education itself. <i>Ante,</i> at 2003-2004. The obvious inference to be drawn from the statute's clear and explicit conferral of discrete types of rights upon parents and children, respectively, is that it does not by accident confer the parent-designated rights upon children, or the children-designated rights upon parents. The Court believes, however, that \"the statute prevents us from placing too much weight on [this] implicatio[n].\" <i>Ibid.</i> That conclusion is in error. Nothing in \"the statute,\" undermines the obvious \"implication\" of Congress's scheme. What the Court relies upon for its conclusion that parents have a substantive right to a FAPE is not the \"statutory structure,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2004, but rather the myriad <i>procedural</i> guarantees accorded to parents in the administrative process, see <i>ibid.</i> But allowing parents, by means of these guarantees, to help shape the contours of their child's education is simply not the same as giving <i>them</i> the right to that education. Nor can the Court sensibly rely on the provisions governing due process hearings and administrative appeals, the various provisions that refer to the \"parent's complaint,\" see, <i>e.g.,</i> 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(III) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), or the fact that the right-to-sue provision, \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A), refers to the administrative complaint, which in turn allows parents to challenge \"any matter\" relating to the provision of a FAPE, \u00a7 1415(b)(6)(A). These provisions prove nothing except what all parties concede: that parents <i>may</i> represent their child <i>pro se</i> at the administrative level. See Brief for Petitioners 17-18, 40; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 12; Brief for Respondent 13, 44; see also <i>Collinsgru v. Palmyra Bd. of Ed.,</i> 161 F.3d 225, 232 (C.A.3 1998). Parents thus have the power, at the administrative stage, to litigate <i>all</i> of the various rights under the statute since at that stage they are acting not only on their <i>own</i> behalf, but on behalf of <i>their child</i> as well. This tells us nothing whatever about <i>whose</i> rights they are.<sup>[5]</sup> The Court's spraying statutory sections about like buckshot cannot create a substantive parental right to education where none exists.</p>\n<p>Harkening back to its earlier discussion of the IDEA's \"text and structure\" (by which it means the statute's procedural protections), the Court announces the startling <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2010</span> proposition that, in fact, the \"IDEA does not differentiate ... between the rights accorded to children and the rights accorded to parents.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2004. If that were so, the Court could have spared us its painful effort to craft a distinctive parental right out of scattered procedural provisions. But of course it is not so. The IDEA quite clearly differentiates between the rights accorded to parents and their children. See <i>Emery v. Roanoke City School Bd.,</i> 432 F.3d 294, 299 (C.A.4 2005) (\"[P]arents and children are distinct legal entities under the IDEA\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). As even petitioners' <i>amici</i> agree, \"Congress specifically indicated that parents have rights under the Act that are separate from and independent of their children's rights.\" Brief for Senator Edward M. Kennedy et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 18. Does the Court seriously contend that a child has a right to reimbursement, when the statute most definitively provides that if \"<i>the parents</i> of a child with a disability\" enroll that child in private school, \"a court ... may require the [school district] to reimburse <i>the parents</i> for the cost of that enrollment\"? \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added); see also Brief for Senator Edward M. Kennedy et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 21 (\"The right of reimbursement runs to the parents\"). Does the Court believe that a child has a procedural right under \u00a7\u00a7 1414(d)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which gives <i>parents</i> the power to excuse an IEP team member from attending an IEP meeting? The IDEA does not remotely envision communal \"family\" rights.</p>\n<p>The Court believes that because parents must prove the substantive inadequacy of a FAPE before obtaining reimbursement, \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), and because the suitability of a FAPE may also be at issue when procedural violations are alleged, \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii), it is \"out of accord with the statute's design\" to \"prevent [parents] from obtaining a judgment mandating that the school district provide their child\" with a FAPE. <i>Ante,</i> at 2004-2005. That is a total non sequitur. That Congress has required parents to demonstrate the inadequacy of their child's FAPE in order to vindicate their own rights says nothing about whether parents possess an underlying right to education. The Court insists that the right to a FAPE is the right \"most fundamental to the Act.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2003-2004. Undoubtedly so, but that sheds no light upon whom the right belongs to, and hence upon who can sue in their own right. Congress has used the phrase \"party aggrieved,\" and it is this Court's job to apply that language, not to run from it.</p>\n<p>The Court further believes that a distinction between parental and child rights will prove difficult to administer. I fail to see why that is so. Before today, the majority of Federal Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue have allowed parents to sue <i>pro se</i> with respect to some claims, but not with respect to the denial of a FAPE. See <i>Mosely v. Board of Ed. of Chicago,</i> 434 F.3d 527, 532 (C.A.7 2006); <i>Collinsgru,</i> 161 F.3d, at 233; <i>Wenger v. Canastota Central School Dist.,</i> 146 F.3d 123, 126 (C.A.2 1998) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Devine v. Indian River Cty. School Bd.,</i> 121 F.3d 576, 581, n. 17 (C.A.11 1997). The Court points to no evidence suggesting that this majority rule has caused any confusion in practice. Nor do I see how it could, since the statute makes clear and easily administrable distinctions between parents' and children's legal entitlements.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court charges that the approach taken by the majority of Courts of Appeals would perpetrate an \"injustice,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2005, since parents who do not seek reimbursement or allege procedural violations would be \"without a remedy,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2004-2005. That, of course, is not true. They will have the same remedy as all parents who sue to vindicate their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2011</span> children's rights: the power to bring suit, represented by counsel. But even indulging the Court's perception that it is unfair to allow some but not all IDEA parents to proceed <i>pro se,</i> that complaint is properly addressed to Congress, which structured the rights as it has, and limited suit to \"party aggrieved.\" And there are good reasons for it to have done so. <i>Pro se</i> cases impose unique burdens on lower courts \u0097 and on defendants, in this case the schools and school districts that must hire their own lawyers. Since <i>pro se</i> complaints are prosecuted essentially for free, without screening by knowledgeable attorneys, they are much more likely to be unmeritorious. And for courts to figure them out without the assistance of plaintiff's counsel is much more difficult and time-consuming. In both categories of <i>pro se</i> parental suit permitted under a proper interpretation of the statute, one or the other of these burdens is reduced. Actions seeking reimbursement are less likely to be frivolous, since not many parents will be willing to lay out the money for private education without some solid reason to believe the FAPE was inadequate. And actions alleging procedural violations can ordinarily be disposed of without the intensive record-review that characterizes suits challenging the suitability of a FAPE.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Petitioners sought reimbursement, alleged procedural violations, and requested a declaration that their child's FAPE was substantively inadequate. <i>Ante,</i> at 1998-1999. I agree with the Court that they may proceed <i>pro se</i> with respect to the first two claims, but I disagree that they may do so with respect to the third.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  As the Court notes, <i>ante,</i> at 1998, 2006-2007, petitioners also argue that even if parents do not have their own rights under the statute, they nonetheless may act on behalf of their child without retaining a lawyer. Both sides agree, however, that the common law generally prohibited lay parents from representing their children in court, a manifestation of the more general common-law rule that nonattorneys cannot litigate the interests of another. See Brief for Petitioners 37; Brief for Respondent 9-10; see also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Collinsgru v. Palmyra Bd. of Ed.,</i> 161 F.3d 225, 232 (C.A.3 1998). Nothing in the IDEA suggests a departure from that rule.</p>\n<p>[2]  Because the grant of those rights is clear, and because I find no statutory basis for any other rights, I need not decide whether the Spending Clause's \"clear notice\" requirement is applicable here. Cf. <i>Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy,</i> 548 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 2455, 2459, 165 L.Ed.2d 526 (2006).</p>\n<p>[3]  Of course when parents assert procedural violations, they must also allege that those violations adversely affected the outcome of the proceedings. Under Article III, one does not have standing to challenge a procedural violation without having some concrete interest in the outcome of the proceeding to which the violation pertains, see <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 571-578, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992), here the parents' interest in having their child receive an appropriate education.</p>\n<p>[4]  Nor can a parental right to education be justified, as the Court attempts, see <i>ante,</i> at 2004-2005, on the theory that the IDEA gives parents a legal right to <i>free</i> schooling for their child. Parents acquire such a right (in limited circumstances) only when they enroll their child in a private institution. \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>[5]  Contrary to indications in the Court's opinion, <i>ante,</i> at 2004, and to the apparent language of the statute, a hearing officer does not always render a decision \"on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education.\" \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(i) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). That provision is \"[s]ubject to clause (ii),\" <i>ibid.,</i> which provides that \"[i]n matters alleging a procedural violation\" a hearing officer can grant relief if \"the procedural inadequacies ... significantly impeded the parents' opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process regarding the provision of a free appropriate public education to the parents' child,\" \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii)(II). It is true that a hearing officer who accepts such an allegation nominally grants relief by concluding that the child did not receive a FAPE, \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii), but it is clear from the structure of the statute that this is not a decision on the substantive adequacy of the FAPE, but rather the label attached to a finding of procedural defect. Petitioners agree with me on this point. See Brief for Petitioners 31, n. 23. See also 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(iii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (\"Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to preclude a hearing officer from ordering a local educational agency to comply with procedural requirements under this section\"). In any event, even if a hearing officer was required to render a decision on the substantive adequacy of the FAPE, that feature of the statute still gives no clue as to whether parents' vindication of that substantive right at the administrative stage is on their own behalf or on behalf of the child.</p>\n\n</div>",

IDEA also governs\n    when and to what extent a court may award attorney\u2019s fees, see\n    \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), including an award \u201cto a prevailing party who is the\n    parent of a child with a disability,\u201d \u00a71415(i)(3)(B)(i)(I). Pp. 5\u20139.\n         (b) These various provisions accord parents independent, en\n    forceable rights. Parents have enforceable rights at the administra\n    tive stage, and it would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme to\n    bar them from continuing to assert those rights in federal court at\n    the adjudication stage. Respondent argues that parental involve\n    ment is contemplated only to the extent parents represent their\n    child\u2019s interests, but this view is foreclosed by the Act\u2019s provisions.\n    The grammatical structure of IDEA\u2019s purpose of protecting \u201cthe\n    rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children,\u201d\n    \u00a71400(d)(1)(B), would make no sense unless \u201crights\u201d refers to the par\n    ents\u2019 rights as well as the child\u2019s. Other provisions confirm this view.\n    See, e.g., \u00a71415(a). Even if this Court were inclined to ignore the\n    Act\u2019s plain text and adopt respondent\u2019s countertextual reading, the\n    Court disagrees that sole purpose driving IDEA\u2019s involvement of par\n    ents is to facilitate vindication of a child\u2019s rights. It is not novel for\n    parents to have a recognized legal interest in their child\u2019s education\n    and upbringing.\n       The Act\u2019s provisions also contradict the variation on respondent\u2019s\n    argument that parents can be \u201cparties aggrieved\u201d for aspects of the\n    hearing officer\u2019s findings and decision relating to certain procedures\n    and reimbursements, but not \u201cparties aggrieved\u201d with regard to any\n                    Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                    3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n challenge not implicating those limited concerns. The IEP proceed\n ings entitle parents to participate not only in the implementation of\n IDEA\u2019s procedures but also in the substantive formulation of their\n child\u2019s educational program. The Act also allows expansive challenge\n by parents of \u201cany matter\u201d related to the proceedings and requires\n that administrative resolution be based on whether the child \u201cre\n ceived a free appropriate public education,\u201d \u00a7\u00a71415(f)(3(E), with judi\n cial review to follow. The text and structure of IDEA create in par\n ents an independent stake not only in the procedures and costs\n implicated by the process but also in the substantive decision to be\n made. Incongruous results would follow, moreover, were the Court to\n accept the proposition that parents\u2019 IDEA rights are limited to cer\n tain nonsubstantive matters. It is difficult to disentangle the Act\u2019s\n procedural and reimbursement-related rights from its substantive\n ones, and attempting to do so would impose upon parties a confusing\n and onerous legal regime, one worsened by the absence of any ex\n press guidance in IDEA concerning how a court might differentiate\n between these matters. This bifurcated regime would also leave\n some parents without any legal remedy. Pp. 9\u201316.\n       (c) Respondent misplaces its reliance on Arlington Central School\n Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U. S. ___, when it contends that be\n cause IDEA was passed pursuant to the Spending Clause, it must\n provide clear notice before it can be interpreted to provide independ\n ent rights to parents. Arlington held that IDEA had not furnished\n clear notice before requiring States to reimburse experts\u2019 fees to pre\n vailing parties in IDEA actions. However, this case does not invoke\n Arlington\u2019s rule, for the determination that IDEA gives parents inde\n pendent, enforceable rights does not impose any substantive condi\n tion or obligation on States that they would not otherwise be required\n by law to observe. The basic measure of monetary recovery is not ex\n panded by recognizing that some rights repose in both the parent and\n the child. Increased costs borne by States defending against suits\n brought by nonlawyers do not suffice to invoke Spending Clause con\n cerns, particularly in light of provisions in IDEA that empower courts\n to award attorney\u2019s fees to prevailing educational agencies if a parent\n files an action for an \u201cimproper purpose,\u201d \u00a71415(i)(3)(B)(i)(III).\n Pp. 16\u201317.\n    2. The Sixth Circuit erred in dismissing the Winkelmans\u2019 appeal\n for lack of counsel. Because parents enjoy rights under IDEA, they\n are entitled to prosecute IDEA claims on their own behalf.

They had sought review related to\nconcerns they had over whether their youngest child, 6\nyear-old Jacob, would progress well at Pleasant Valley\nElementary School, which is part of the Parma City School\nDistrict in Parma, Ohio.\n   Jacob has autism spectrum disorder and is covered by\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Act or\nIDEA), 84 Stat. 175, as amended, 20 U. S. C. \u00a71400 et seq.\n(2000 ed. and Supp. IV). His parents worked with the\nschool district to develop an individualized education\nprogram (IEP), as required by the Act. All concede that\nJacob\u2019s parents had the statutory right to contribute to\nthis process and, when agreement could not be reached, to\nparticipate in administrative proceedings including what\nthe Act refers to as an \u201cimpartial due process hearing.\u201d\n\u00a71415(f)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).\n2        WINKELMAN v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DIST.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The disagreement at the center of the current dispute\nconcerns the procedures to be followed when parents and\ntheir child, dissatisfied with the outcome of the due proc\ness hearing, seek further review in a United States Dis\ntrict Court. The question is whether parents, either on\ntheir own behalf or as representatives of the child, may\nproceed in court unrepresented by counsel though they are\nnot trained or licensed as attorneys. Resolution of this\nissue requires us to examine and explain the provisions of\nIDEA to determine if it accords to parents rights of their\nown that can be vindicated in court proceedings, or alter\nnatively, whether the Act allows them, in their status as\nparents, to represent their child in court proceedings.\n                              I\n  Respondent Parma City School District, a participant in\nIDEA\u2019s educational spending program, accepts federal\nfunds for assistance in the education of children with\ndisabilities. As a condition of receiving funds, it must\ncomply with IDEA\u2019s mandates. IDEA requires that the\nschool district provide Jacob with a \u201cfree appropriate\npublic education,\u201d which must operate in accordance with\nthe IEP that Jacob\u2019s parents, along with school officials\nand other individuals, develop as members of Jacob\u2019s \u201cIEP\nTeam.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 3 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n  The school district proposed an IEP for the 2003\u20132004\nschool year that would have placed Jacob at a public ele\nmentary school. Regarding this IEP as deficient under\nIDEA, Jacob\u2019s nonlawyer parents availed themselves of\nthe administrative review provided by IDEA. They filed a\ncomplaint alleging respondent had failed to provide Jacob\nwith a free appropriate public education; they appealed\nthe hearing officer\u2019s rejection of the claims in this com\nplaint to a state-level review officer; and after losing that\nappeal they filed, on their own behalf and on behalf of\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nJacob, a complaint in the United States District Court for\nthe Northern District of Ohio. In reliance upon 20 U. S. C.\n\u00a71415(i)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) they challenged the ad\nministrative decision, alleging, among other matters: that\nJacob had not been provided with a free appropriate public\neducation; that his IEP was inadequate; and that the\nschool district had failed to follow procedures mandated by\nIDEA. Pending the resolution of these challenges, the\nWinkelmans had enrolled Jacob in a private school at\ntheir own expense. They had also obtained counsel to\nassist them with certain aspects of the proceedings, al\nthough they filed their federal complaint, and later their\nappeal, without the aid of an attorney. The Winkelmans\u2019\ncomplaint sought reversal of the administrative decision,\nreimbursement for private-school expenditures and attor\nney\u2019s fees already incurred, and, it appears, declaratory\nrelief.\n  The District Court granted respondent\u2019s motion for\njudgment on the pleadings, finding it had provided Jacob\nwith a free appropriate public education. Petitioners,\nproceeding without counsel, filed an appeal with the Court\nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Relying on its recent\ndecision in Cavanaugh v. Cardinal Local School Dist., 409\nF. 3d 753 (2005), the Court of Appeals entered an order\ndismissing the Winkelmans\u2019 appeal unless they obtained\ncounsel to represent Jacob. See Order in No. 05\u20133886\n(Nov. 4, 2005), App. A to Pet. for Cert. 1a. In Cavanaugh\nthe Court of Appeals had rejected the proposition that\nIDEA allows nonlawyer parents raising IDEA claims to\nproceed pro se in federal court. The court ruled that the\nright to a free appropriate public education \u201cbelongs to the\nchild alone,\u201d 409 F. 3d, at 757, not to both the parents and\nthe child. It followed, the court held, that \u201cany right on\nwhich the [parents] could proceed on their own behalf\nwould be derivative\u201d of the child\u2019s right, ibid., so that\nparents bringing IDEA claims were not appearing on their\n4         WINKELMAN v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DIST.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nown behalf, ibid. See also 28 U. S. C. \u00a71654 (allowing\nparties to prosecute their own claims pro se). As for the\nparents\u2019 alternative argument, the court held, nonlawyer\nparents cannot litigate IDEA claims on behalf of their\nchild because IDEA does not abrogate the common-law\nrule prohibiting nonlawyer parents from representing\nminor children. 409 F. 3d, at 756. As the court in Cava\nnaugh acknowledged, its decision brought the Sixth Cir\ncuit in direct conflict with the First Circuit, which had\nconcluded, under a theory of \u201cstatutory joint rights,\u201d that\nthe Act accords to parents the right to assert IDEA claims\non their own behalf. See Maroni v. Pemi-Baker Regional\nSchool Dist., 346 F. 3d 247, 249, 250 (CA1 2003).\n  Petitioners sought review in this Court. In light of the\ndisagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to whether\na nonlawyer parent of a child with a disability may prose\ncute IDEA actions pro se in federal court, we granted\ncertiorari. 549 U. S. ___ (2006). Compare Cavanaugh,\nsupra, with Maroni, supra; see also Mosely v. Board of Ed.\nof Chicago, 434 F. 3d 527 (CA7 2006); Collinsgru v. Pal\nmyra Bd. of Ed., 161 F. 3d 225 (CA3 1998); Wenger v.\nCanastota Central School Dist., 146 F. 3d 123 (CA2 1998)\n(per curiam); Devine v. Indian River Cty. School Bd., 121\nF. 3d 576 (CA11 1997).\n                              II\n   Our resolution of this case turns upon the significance of\nIDEA\u2019s interlocking statutory provisions.         Petitioners\u2019\nprimary theory is that the Act makes parents real parties\nin interest to IDEA actions, not \u201cmer[e] guardians of their\nchildren\u2019s rights.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 16. If correct, this\nallows Mr. and Mrs. Winkelman back into court, for there\nis no question that a party may represent his or her own\ninterests in federal court without the aid of counsel. See\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71654 (\u201cIn all courts of the United States the\nparties may plead and conduct their own cases personally\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

Petitioners cannot cite a specific pro\nvision in IDEA mandating in direct and explicit terms that\nparents have the status of real parties in interest. They\ninstead base their argument on a comprehensive reading\nof IDEA. Taken as a whole, they contend, the Act leads to\nthe necessary conclusion that parents have independent,\nenforceable rights. Brief for Petitioners 14 (citing Koons\nBuick Pontiac GMC, Inc. v. Nigh, 543 U. S. 50, 60 (2004)).\nRespondent, accusing petitioners of \u201cknit[ting] together\nvarious provisions pulled from the crevices of the statute\u201d\nto support these claims, Brief for Respondent 19, reads the\ntext of IDEA to mean that any redressable rights under\nthe Act belong only to children, id., at 19\u201340.\n   We agree that the text of IDEA resolves the question\npresented. We recognize, in addition, that a proper inter\npretation of the Act requires a consideration of the entire\nstatutory scheme. See Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S.\n481, 486 (2006). Turning to the current version of IDEA,\nwhich the parties agree governs this case, we begin with\nan overview of the relevant statutory provisions.\n                             A\n  The goals of IDEA include \u201censur[ing] that all children\nwith disabilities have available to them a free appropriate\npublic education\u201d and \u201censur[ing] that the rights of chil\ndren with disabilities and parents of such children are\nprotected.\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71400(d)(1)(A)\u2013(B) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV). To this end, the Act includes provisions govern\ning four areas of particular relevance to the Winkelmans\u2019\nclaim: procedures to be followed when developing a child\u2019s\nIEP; criteria governing the sufficiency of an education\nprovided to a child; mechanisms for review that must be\nmade available when there are objections to the IEP or to\nother aspects of IDEA proceedings; and the requirement in\ncertain circumstances that States reimburse parents for\nvarious expenses. See generally \u00a7\u00a71412(a)(10), 1414,\n6        WINKELMAN v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DIST.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1415. Although our discussion of these four areas does not\nidentify all the illustrative provisions, we do take particu\nlar note of certain terms that mandate or otherwise de\nscribe parental involvement.\n   IDEA requires school districts to develop an IEP for\neach child with a disability, see \u00a7\u00a71412(a)(4), 1414(d), with\nparents playing \u201ca significant role\u201d in this process,\nSchaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 53 (2005). Parents serve\nas members of the team that develops the IEP.\n\u00a71414(d)(1)(B). The \u201cconcerns\u201d parents have \u201cfor enhanc\ning the education of their child\u201d must be considered by the\nteam. \u00a71414(d)(3)(A)(ii). IDEA accords parents additional\nprotections that apply throughout the IEP process. See,\ne.g., \u00a71414(d)(4)(A) (requiring the IEP Team to revise the\nIEP when appropriate to address certain information\nprovided by the parents); \u00a71414(e) (requiring States to\n\u201censure that the parents of [a child with a disability] are\nmembers of any group that makes decisions on the educa\ntional placement of their child\u201d). The statute also sets up\ngeneral procedural safeguards that protect the informed\ninvolvement of parents in the development of an education\nfor their child. See, e.g., \u00a71415(a) (requiring States to\n\u201cestablish and maintain procedures . . . to ensure that\nchildren with disabilities and their parents are guaran\nteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of\na free appropriate public education\u201d); \u00a71415(b)(1) (mandat\ning that States provide an opportunity for parents to\nexamine all relevant records). See generally \u00a7\u00a71414, 1415.\nA central purpose of the parental protections is to facili\ntate the provision of a \u201c \u2018free appropriate public educa\ntion,\u2019 \u201d \u00a71401(9), which must be made available to the child\n\u201cin conformity with the [IEP],\u201d \u00a71401(9)(D).\n   The Act defines a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d\npursuant to an IEP to be an educational instruction \u201cspe\ncially designed . . . to meet the unique needs of a child\nwith a disability,\u201d \u00a71401(29), coupled with any additional\n                  Cite as: 550 U.

The education must,\namong other things, be provided \u201cunder public supervision\nand direction,\u201d \u201cmeet the standards of the State educa\ntional agency,\u201d and \u201cinclude an appropriate preschool,\nelementary school, or secondary school education in the\nState involved.\u201d Ibid. The instruction must, in addition,\nbe provided at \u201cno cost to parents.\u201d \u00a71401(29). See gener\nally Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School\nDist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176 (1982)\n(discussing the meaning of \u201cfree appropriate public educa\ntion\u201d as used in the statutory precursor to IDEA).\n    When a party objects to the adequacy of the education\nprovided, the construction of the IEP, or some related\nmatter, IDEA provides procedural recourse: It requires\nthat a State provide \u201c[a]n opportunity for any party to\npresent a complaint . . . with respect to any matter relat\ning to the identification, evaluation, or educational place\nment of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate\npublic education to such child.\u201d \u00a71415(b)(6). By present\ning a complaint a party is able to pursue a process of\nreview that, as relevant, begins with a preliminary meet\ning \u201cwhere the parents of the child discuss their com\nplaint\u201d and the local educational agency \u201cis provided the\nopportunity to [reach a resolution].\u201d \u00a71415(f)(1)(B)(i)(IV).\nIf the agency \u201chas not resolved the complaint to the satis\nfaction of the parents within 30 days,\u201d \u00a71415(f)(1)(B)(ii),\nthe parents may request an \u201cimpartial due process hear\ning,\u201d \u00a71415(f)(1)(A), which must be conducted either by the\nlocal educational agency or by the state educational\nagency, ibid., and where a hearing officer will resolve\nissues raised in the complaint, \u00a71415(f)(3).\n    IDEA sets standards the States must follow in conduct\ning these hearings. Among other things, it indicates that\nthe hearing officer\u2019s decision \u201cshall be made on substan\n8         WINKELMAN v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DIST.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntive grounds based on a determination of whether the\nchild received a free appropriate public education,\u201d and\nthat, \u201c[i]n matters alleging a procedural violation,\u201d the\nofficer may find a child \u201cdid not receive a free appropriate\npublic education\u201d only if the violation\n      \u201c(I) impeded the child\u2019s right to a free appropriate\n    public education;\n      \u201c(II) significantly impeded the parents\u2019 opportunity\n    to participate in the decisionmaking process regarding\n    the provision of a free appropriate public education to\n    the parents\u2019 child; or\n      \u201c(III) caused a deprivation of educational benefits.\u201d\n    \u00a7\u00a71415(f)(3)(E)(i)\u2013(ii).\nIf the local educational agency, rather than the state\neducational agency, conducts this hearing, then \u201cany party\naggrieved by the findings and decision rendered in such a\nhearing may appeal such findings and decision to the\nState educational agency.\u201d \u00a71415(g)(1). Once the state\neducational agency has reached its decision, an aggrieved\nparty may commence suit in federal court: \u201cAny party\naggrieved by the findings and decision made [by the hear\ning officer] shall have the right to bring a civil action with\nrespect to the complaint.\u201d          \u00a71415(i)(2)(A); see also\n\u00a71415(i)(1).\n   IDEA, finally, provides for at least two means of cost\nrecovery that inform our analysis. First, in certain cir\ncumstances it allows a court or hearing officer to require a\nstate agency \u201cto reimburse the parents [of a child with a\ndisability] for the cost of [private school] enrollment if the\ncourt or hearing officer finds that the agency had not\nmade a free appropriate public education available to the\nchild.\u201d \u00a71412(a)(10)(C)(ii). Second, it sets forth rules\ngoverning when and to what extent a court may award\nattorney\u2019s fees. See \u00a71415(i)(3)(B). Included in this sec\ntion is a provision allowing an award \u201cto a prevailing party\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

We\nagree. The parents enjoy enforceable rights at the admin\nistrative stage, and it would be inconsistent with the\nstatutory scheme to bar them from continuing to assert\nthese rights in federal court.\n   The statute sets forth procedures for resolving disputes\nin a manner that, in the Act\u2019s express terms, contemplates\nparents will be the parties bringing the administrative\ncomplaints. In addition to the provisions we have cited,\nwe refer also to \u00a71415(b)(8) (requiring a state educational\nagency to \u201cdevelop a model form to assist parents in filing\na complaint\u201d); \u00a71415(c)(2) (addressing the response an\nagency must provide to a \u201cparent\u2019s due process complaint\nnotice\u201d); and \u00a71415(i)(3)(B)(i) (referring to \u201cthe parent\u2019s\ncomplaint\u201d). A wide range of review is available: Adminis\ntrative complaints may be brought with respect to \u201cany\nmatter relating to . . . the provision of a free appropriate\npublic education.\u201d \u00a71415(b)(6)(A). Claims raised in these\ncomplaints are then resolved at impartial due process\nhearings, where, again, the statute makes clear that\nparents will be participating as parties. See generally\nsupra, at 7\u20138. See also \u00a71415(f)(3)(C) (indicating \u201c[a]\nparent or agency shall request an impartial due process\nhearing\u201d within a certain period of time); \u00a71415(e)(2)(A)(ii)\n(referring to \u201ca parent\u2019s right to a due process hearing\u201d).\nThe statute then grants \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved by the\nfindings and decision made [by the hearing officer] . . . the\nright to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint.\u201d\n\u00a71415(i)(2)(A).\n   Nothing in these interlocking provisions excludes a\nparent who has exercised his or her own rights from statu\n10       WINKELMAN v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DIST.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntory protection the moment the administrative proceed\nings end. Put another way, the Act does not sub silentio or\nby implication bar parents from seeking to vindicate the\nrights accorded to them once the time comes to file a civil\naction. Through its provisions for expansive review and\nextensive parental involvement, the statute leads to just\nthe opposite result.\n   Respondent, resisting this line of analysis, asks us to\nread these provisions as contemplating parental involve\nment only to the extent parents represent their child\u2019s\ninterests. In respondent\u2019s view IDEA accords parents\nnothing more than \u201ccollateral tools related to the child\u2019s\nunderlying substantive rights\u2014not freestanding or inde\npendently enforceable rights.\u201d Brief for Respondent 25.\n   This interpretation, though, is foreclosed by provisions\nof the statute. IDEA defines one of its purposes as seeking\n\u201cto ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and\nparents of such children are protected.\u201d \u00a71400(d)(1)(B).\nThe word \u201crights\u201d in the quoted language refers to the\nrights of parents as well as the rights of the child; other\nwise the grammatical structure would make no sense.\n   Further provisions confirm this view. IDEA mandates\nthat educational agencies establish procedures \u201cto ensure\nthat children with disabilities and their parents are guar\nanteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision\nof a free appropriate public education.\u201d \u00a71415(a). It pre\nsumes parents have rights of their own when it defines\nhow States might provide for the transfer of the \u201crights\naccorded to parents\u201d by IDEA, \u00a71415(m)(1)(B), and it\nprohibits     the     raising   of    certain    challenges\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding any other individual right of action\nthat a parent or student may maintain under [the relevant\nprovisions of IDEA],\u201d \u00a7\u00a71401(10)(E), 1412(a)(14)(E). To\nadopt respondent\u2019s reading of the statute would require an\ninterpretation of these statutory provisions (and others)\nfar too strained to be correct.\n                  Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Defending its countertextual reading of the statute,\nrespondent cites a decision by a Court of Appeals conclud\ning that the Act\u2019s \u201creferences to parents are best under\nstood as accommodations to the fact of the child\u2019s incapac\nity.\u201d Doe v. Board of Ed. of Baltimore Cty., 165 F. 3d 260,\n263 (CA4 1998); see also Brief for Respondent 30. This,\naccording to respondent, requires us to interpret all refer\nences to parents\u2019 rights as referring in implicit terms to\nthe child\u2019s rights\u2014which, under this view, are the only\nenforceable rights accorded by IDEA. Even if we were\ninclined to ignore the plain text of the statute in consider\ning this theory, we disagree that the sole purpose driving\nIDEA\u2019s involvement of parents is to facilitate vindication\nof a child\u2019s rights. It is not a novel proposition to say that\nparents have a recognized legal interest in the education\nand upbringing of their child. See, e.g., Pierce v. Society of\nSisters, 268 U. S. 510, 534\u2013535 (1925) (acknowledging \u201cthe\nliberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing\nand education of children under their control\u201d); Meyer v.\nNebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399\u2013401 (1923). There is no\nnecessary bar or obstacle in the law, then, to finding an\nintention by Congress to grant parents a stake in the\nentitlements created by IDEA. Without question a parent\nof a child with a disability has a particular and personal\ninterest in fulfilling \u201cour national policy of ensuring equal\nity of opportunity, full participation, independent living,\nand economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabili\nties.\u201d \u00a71400(c)(1).\n   We therefore find no reason to read into the plain lan\nguage of the statute an implicit rejection of the notion that\nCongress would accord parents independent, enforceable\nrights concerning the education of their children. We\ninstead interpret the statute\u2019s references to parents\u2019 rights\nto mean what they say: that IDEA includes provisions\nconveying rights to parents as well as to children.\n   A variation on respondent\u2019s argument has persuaded\n12       WINKELMAN v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DIST.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsome Courts of Appeals. The argument is that while a\nparent can be a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d for aspects of the hear\ning officer\u2019s findings and decision, he or she cannot be a\n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d with respect to all IDEA-based chal\nlenges. Under this view the causes of action available to a\nparent might relate, for example, to various procedural\nmandates, see, e.g., Collinsgru, 161 F. 3d, at 233, and\nreimbursement demands, see, e.g., \u00a71412(a)(10)(C)(ii).\nThe argument supporting this conclusion proceeds as\nfollows: Because a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d is, by definition,\nentitled to a remedy, and parents are, under IDEA, only\nentitled to certain procedures and reimbursements as\nremedies, a parent cannot be a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d with\nregard to any claim not implicating these limited matters.\n   This argument is contradicted by the statutory provi\nsions we have recited. True, there are provisions in IDEA\nstating parents are entitled to certain procedural protec\ntions and reimbursements; but the statute prevents us\nfrom placing too much weight on the implications to be\ndrawn when other entitlements are accorded in less clear\nlanguage. We find little support for the inference that\nparents are excluded by implication whenever a child is\nmentioned, and vice versa. Compare, e.g., \u00a71411(e)(3)(E)\n(barring States from using certain funds for costs associ\nated with actions \u201cbrought on behalf of a child\u201d but failing\nto acknowledge that actions might also be brought on\nbehalf of a parent) with \u00a71415(i)(3)(B)(i) (allowing recovery\nof attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201cprevailing party who is the parent\nof a child with a disability\u201d but failing to acknowledge that\na child might also be a prevailing party). Without more,\nthen, the language in IDEA confirming that parents enjoy\nparticular procedural and reimbursement-related rights\ndoes not resolve whether they are also entitled to enforce\nIDEA\u2019s other mandates, including the one most funda\nmental to the Act: the provision of a free appropriate\npublic education to a child with a disability.\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We consider the statutory structure. The IEP proceed\nings entitle parents to participate not only in the imple\nmentation of IDEA\u2019s procedures but also in the substan\ntive formulation of their child\u2019s educational program.\nAmong other things, IDEA requires the IEP Team, which\nincludes the parents as members, to take into account any\n\u201cconcerns\u201d parents have \u201cfor enhancing the education of\ntheir child\u201d when it formulates the IEP. \u00a71414(d)(3)(A)(ii).\nThe IEP, in turn, sets the boundaries of the central enti\ntlement provided by IDEA: It defines a \u201c \u2018free appropriate\npublic education\u2019 \u201d for that parent\u2019s child. \u00a71401(9).\n   The statute also empowers parents to bring challenges\nbased on a broad range of issues. The parent may seek a\nhearing on \u201cany matter relating to the identification,\nevaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the\nprovision of a free appropriate public education to such\nchild.\u201d \u00a71415(b)(6)(A). To resolve these challenges a\nhearing officer must make a decision based on whether the\nchild \u201creceived a free appropriate public education.\u201d\n\u00a71415(f)(3)(E). When this hearing has been conducted by\na local educational agency rather than a state educational\nagency, \u201cany party aggrieved by the findings and decision\nrendered in such a hearing may appeal such findings and\ndecision\u201d to the state educational agency. \u00a71415(g)(1).\nJudicial review follows, authorized by a broadly worded\nprovision phrased in the same terms used to describe the\nprior stage of review: \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved\u201d may bring \u201ca\ncivil action.\u201d \u00a71415(i)(2)(A).\n   These provisions confirm that IDEA, through its text\nand structure, creates in parents an independent stake not\nonly in the procedures and costs implicated by this process\nbut also in the substantive decisions to be made. We\ntherefore conclude that IDEA does not differentiate,\nthrough isolated references to various procedures and\nremedies, between the rights accorded to children and the\nrights accorded to parents. As a consequence, a parent\n14       WINKELMAN v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DIST.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmay be a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d for purposes of \u00a71415(i)(2) with\nregard to \u201cany matter\u201d implicating these rights. See\n\u00a71415(b)(6)(A). The status of parents as parties is not\nlimited to matters that relate to procedure and cost recov\nery. To find otherwise would be inconsistent with the\ncollaborative framework and expansive system of review\nestablished by the Act. Cf. Cedar Rapids Community\nSchool Dist. v. Garret F., 526 U. S. 66, 73 (1999) (look-\ning to IDEA\u2019s \u201coverall statutory scheme\u201d to interpret its\nprovisions).\n   Our conclusion is confirmed by noting the incongruous\nresults that would follow were we to accept the proposition\nthat parents\u2019 IDEA rights are limited to certain non-\nsubstantive matters. The statute\u2019s procedural and reim\nbursement-related rights are intertwined with the sub\nstantive adequacy of the education provided to a child, see,\ne.g., \u00a71415(f)(3)(E), see also \u00a71412(a)(10)(C)(ii), and it is\ndifficult to disentangle the provisions in order to conclude\nthat some rights adhere to both parent and child while\nothers do not. Were we nevertheless to recognize a dis\ntinction of this sort it would impose upon parties a confus\ning and onerous legal regime, one worsened by the absence\nof any express guidance in IDEA concerning how a court\nmight in practice differentiate between these matters. It\nis, in addition, out of accord with the statute\u2019s design to\ninterpret the Act to require that parents prove the sub\nstantive inadequacy of their child\u2019s education as a predi\ncate for obtaining, for example, reimbursement under\n\u00a71412(a)(10)(C)(ii), yet to prevent them from obtaining a\njudgment mandating that the school district provide their\nchild with an educational program demonstrated to be an\nappropriate one. The adequacy of the educational pro\ngram is, after all, the central issue in the litigation. The\nprovisions of IDEA do not set forth these distinctions, and\nwe decline to infer them.\n   The bifurcated regime suggested by the courts that have\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nemployed it, moreover, leaves some parents without a\nremedy. The statute requires, in express terms, that\nStates provide a child with a free appropriate public edu\ncation \u201cat public expense,\u201d \u00a71401(9)(A), including specially\ndesigned instruction \u201cat no cost to parents,\u201d \u00a71401(29).\nParents may seek to enforce this mandate through the\nfederal courts, we conclude, because among the rights they\nenjoy is the right to a free appropriate public education for\ntheir child. Under the countervailing view, which would\nmake a parent\u2019s ability to enforce IDEA dependant on\ncertain procedural and reimbursement-related rights, a\nparent whose disabled child has not received a free appro\npriate public education would have recourse in the federal\ncourts only under two circumstances: when the parent\nhappens to have some claim related to the procedures\nemployed; and when he or she is able to incur, and has in\nfact incurred, expenses creating a right to reimbursement.\nOtherwise the adequacy of the child\u2019s education would not\nbe regarded as relevant to any cause of action the parent\nmight bring; and, as a result, only the child could vindi\ncate the right accorded by IDEA to a free appropriate\npublic education.\n  The potential for injustice in this result is apparent.\nWhat is more, we find nothing in the statute to indicate\nthat when Congress required States to provide adequate\ninstruction to a child \u201cat no cost to parents,\u201d it intended\nthat only some parents would be able to enforce that\nmandate. The statute instead takes pains to \u201censure that\nthe rights of children with disabilities and parents of such\nchildren are protected.\u201d        \u00a71400(d)(1)(B).    See, e.g.,\n\u00a71415(e)(2) (requiring that States implement procedures\nto ensure parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards\nwith respect to the provision of a free appropriate public\neducation); \u00a71415(e)(2)(A)(ii) (requiring that mediation\nprocedures not be \u201cused to deny or delay a parent\u2019s right to\na due process hearing . . . or to deny any other rights\n16       WINKELMAN v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DIST.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nafforded under this subchapter\u201d); cf. \u00a71400(c)(3) (noting\nIDEA\u2019s success in \u201censuring children with disabilities and\nthe families of such children access to a free appropriate\npublic education\u201d).\n  We conclude IDEA grants parents independent, en\nforceable rights. These rights, which are not limited to\ncertain procedural and reimbursement-related matters,\nencompass the entitlement to a free appropriate public\neducation for the parents\u2019 child.\n                                C\n  Respondent contends, though, that even under the\nreasoning we have now explained petitioners cannot pre\nvail without overcoming a further difficulty. Citing our\nopinion in Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v.\nMurphy, 548 U. S. ___ (2006), respondent argues that\nstatutes passed pursuant to the Spending Clause, such as\nIDEA, must provide \u201c \u2018clear notice\u2019 \u201d before they can burden\na State with some new condition, obligation, or liability.\nBrief for Respondent 41. Respondent contends that be\ncause IDEA is, at best, ambiguous as to whether it accords\nparents independent rights, it has failed to provide clear\nnotice of this condition to the States. See id., at 40\u201349.\n  Respondent\u2019s reliance on Arlington is misplaced. In\nArlington we addressed whether IDEA required States to\nreimburse experts\u2019 fees to prevailing parties in IDEA\nactions. \u201c[W]hen Congress attaches conditions to a State\u2019s\nacceptance of federal funds,\u201d we explained, \u201cthe conditions\nmust be set out \u2018unambiguously.\u2019 \u201d 548 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 3) (quoting Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981)). The question to be\nanswered in Arlington, therefore, was whether IDEA\n\u201cfurnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue.\u201d\n548 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). We found it did not.\n  The instant case presents a different issue, one that\ndoes not invoke the same rule. Our determination that\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIDEA grants to parents independent, enforceable rights\ndoes not impose any substantive condition or obligation on\nStates they would not otherwise be required by law to\nobserve. The basic measure of monetary recovery, more\nover, is not expanded by recognizing that some rights\nrepose in both the parent and the child. Were we consid\nering a statute other than the one before us, the Spending\nClause argument might have more force: A determination\nby the Court that some distinct class of people has inde\npendent, enforceable rights might result in a change to the\nStates\u2019 statutory obligations. But that is not the case\nhere.\n  Respondent argues our ruling will, as a practical matter,\nincrease costs borne by the States as they are forced to\ndefend against suits unconstrained by attorneys trained in\nthe law and the rules of ethics. Effects such as these do\nnot suffice to invoke the concerns under the Spending\nClause. Furthermore, IDEA does afford relief for the\nStates in certain cases. The Act empowers courts to award\nattorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing educational agency when\never a parent has presented a \u201ccomplaint or subsequent\ncause of action . . . for any improper purpose, such as to\nharass, to cause unnecessary delay, or to needlessly in\ncrease the cost of litigation.\u201d \u00a71415(i)(3)(B)(i)(III). This\nprovision allows some relief when a party has proceeded in\nviolation of these standards.\n                            III\n  The Court of Appeals erred when it dismissed the\nWinkelmans\u2019 appeal for lack of counsel. Parents enjoy\nrights under IDEA; and they are, as a result, entitled to\nprosecute IDEA claims on their own behalf. The decision\nby Congress to grant parents these rights was consistent\nwith the purpose of IDEA and fully in accord with our\nsocial and legal traditions. It is beyond dispute that the\nrelationship between a parent and child is sufficient to\n18        WINKELMAN v.

S. C. \u00a71400 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. IV),\nwhen they seek reimbursement for private school expenses\nor redress for violations of their own procedural rights, but\nnot when they seek a judicial determination that their\nchild\u2019s free appropriate public education (or FAPE) is\nsubstantively inadequate.\n   Whether parents may bring suits under the IDEA with\nout a lawyer depends upon the interaction between the\nIDEA and the general pro se provision in the Judiciary Act\nof 1789. The latter, codified at 28 U. S. C. \u00a71654, provides\nthat \u201c[i]n all courts of the United States the parties may\nplead and conduct their own cases personally or by coun\nsel.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The IDEA\u2019s right-to-sue provi\nsion, 20 U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(2)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), pro\nvides that \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved by the findings and\ndecision [of a hearing officer] shall have the right to bring\na civil action with respect to the [administrative] com\nplaint.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, when parents are \u201cpar\nties aggrieved\u201d under the IDEA, they are \u201cparties\u201d within\n2           WINKELMAN v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DIST.\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe meaning of 28 U. S. C. \u00a71654, entitled to sue on their\nown behalf.1\n   As both parties agree, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; Brief for\nRespondent 37, \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d means \u201c[a] party enti\ntled to a remedy; esp., a party whose personal, pecuniary,\nor property rights have been adversely affected by another\nperson\u2019s actions or by a court\u2019s decree or judgment,\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1154 (8th ed. 2004); see also ante,\nat 12. This case thus turns on the rights that the IDEA\naccords to parents, and the concomitant remedies made\navailable to them. Only with respect to such rights and\nremedies are parents properly viewed as \u201cparties ag\ngrieved,\u201d capable of filing their own cases in federal court.\n   A review of the statutory text makes clear that, as\nrelevant here, the IDEA grants parents only two types of\nrights.2 First, under certain circumstances \u201ca court or a\nhearing officer may require the [school district] to reim\nburse the parents\u201d for private school expenditures \u201cif the\ncourt or hearing officer finds that the [school district] had\nnot made a free appropriate public education available to\nthe child.\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a71412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp.\nIV) (emphasis added). Second, parents are accorded a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As the Court notes, ante, at 2, 18, petitioners also argue that even if\n\nparents do not have their own rights under the statute, they nonethe\nless may act on behalf of their child without retaining a lawyer. Both\nsides agree, however, that the common law generally prohibited lay\nparents from representing their children in court, a manifestation of\nthe more general common-law rule that nonattorneys cannot litigate\nthe interests of another.

Nothing in the IDEA suggests a departure from\nthat rule.\n  2 Because the grant of those rights is clear, and because I find no\n\nstatutory basis for any other rights, I need not decide whether the\nSpending Clause\u2019s \u201cclear notice\u201d requirement is applicable here. Cf.\nArlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U. S. ___, ___\n(2006) (slip op., at 4).\n                    Cite as: 550 U.

It is clear that parents\nmay object to procedural violations at the administrative\ndue process hearing, see \u00a71415(b)(6)(A), and that a hear\ning officer may provide relief to parents for certain proce\ndural infractions, see \u00a71415(f)(3)(E)(ii). Because the rights\nto reimbursement and to the various procedural protec\ntions are accorded to parents themselves, they are \u201cparties\naggrieved\u201d when those rights are infringed, and may\naccordingly proceed pro se when seeking to vindicate\nthem.3\n   The Court goes further, however, concluding that par\nents may proceed pro se not only when they seek reim\nbursement or assert procedural violations, but also when\nthey challenge the substantive adequacy of their child\u2019s\nFAPE\u2014so that parents may act without a lawyer in every\nIDEA case. See ante, at 11\u201316. In my view, this sweeps\nfar more broadly than the text allows. Out of this sprawl\ning statute the Court cannot identify even a single provi\nsion stating that parents have the substantive right to a\nFAPE. The reason for this is readily understandable: The\nright to a free appropriate public education obviously\ninheres in the child, for it is he who receives the education.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Of course when parents assert procedural violations, they must also\n\nallege that those violations adversely affected the outcome of the\nproceedings. Under Article III, one does not have standing to challenge\na procedural violation without having some concrete interest in the\noutcome of the proceeding to which the violation pertains, see Lujan v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 571\u2013578 (1992), here the parents\u2019\ninterest in having their child receive an appropriate education.\n4           WINKELMAN v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DIST.\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nAs the IDEA instructs, participating States must provide\na \u201cfree appropriate public education . . . to all children\nwith disabilities . . . .\u201d \u00a71412(a)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).\nThe statute is replete with references to the fact that a\nFAPE belongs to the child. See, e.g., \u00a71400(d)(1)(A) (IDEA\ndesigned \u201cto ensure that all children with disabilities have\navailable to them a free appropriate public education\u201d);\n\u00a71408(a)(2)(C)(i) (referring to \u201cthe right of a child\u201d to \u201cre\nceive a free appropriate public education\u201d); \u00a71411(e)(3)(F)(i)\n(same); \u00a71414(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) (referring to an agency \u201cthat is\nresponsible for making a free appropriate public education\navailable to a child\u201d); \u00a71415(b)(6)(A) (referring to \u201cthe\nprovision of a free appropriate public education to [a]\nchild\u201d). The parents of a disabled child no doubt have an\ninterest in seeing their child receive a proper education.\nBut there is a difference between an interest and a statu\ntory right. The text of the IDEA makes clear that parents\nhave no right to the education itself.4\n   The Court concedes, as it must, that while the IDEA\ngives parents the right to reimbursement and procedural\nprotection in explicit terms, it does not do so for the sup\nposed right to the education itself. Ante, at 12. The obvi\nous inference to be drawn from the statute\u2019s clear and\nexplicit conferral of discrete types of rights upon parents\nand children, respectively, is that it does not by accident\nconfer the parent-designated rights upon children, or the\nchildren-designated rights upon parents. The Court be\nlieves, however, that \u201cthe statute prevents us from placing\ntoo much weight on [this] implicatio[n].\u201d Ibid. That con\nclusion is in error. Nothing in \u201cthe statute,\u201d undermines\nthe obvious \u201cimplication\u201d of Congress\u2019s scheme. What the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Nor can a parental right to education be justified, as the Court at\n\ntempts, see ante, at 14\u201315, on the theory that the IDEA gives parents a\nlegal right to free schooling for their child. Parents acquire such a right\n(in limited circumstances) only when they enroll their child in a private\ninstitution. \u00a71412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).\n                      Cite as: 550 U.

But allowing parents, by means of these guaran\ntees, to help shape the contours of their child\u2019s education\nis simply not the same as giving them the right to that\neducation. Nor can the Court sensibly rely on the provi\nsions governing due process hearings and administrative\nappeals, the various provisions that refer to the \u201cparent\u2019s\ncomplaint,\u201d see, e.g., 20 U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B)(i)(III) (2000\ned., Supp. IV), or the fact that the right-to-sue provision,\n\u00a71415(i)(2)(A), refers to the administrative complaint,\nwhich in turn allows parents to challenge \u201cany matter\u201d\nrelating to the provision of a FAPE, \u00a71415(b)(6)(A). These\nprovisions prove nothing except what all parties concede:\nthat parents may represent their child pro se at the ad\nministrative level. See Brief for Petitioners 17\u201318, 40;\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12; Brief for\nRespondent 13, 44; see also Collingsru v. Palmyra Bd. of\nEd., 161 F. 3d 225, 232 (CA3 1998). Parents thus have the\npower, at the administrative stage, to litigate all of the\nvarious rights under the statute since at that stage they\nare acting not only on their own behalf, but on behalf of\ntheir child as well. This tells us nothing whatever about\nwhose rights they are.5 The Court\u2019s spraying statutory\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Contrary   to indications in the Court\u2019s opinion, ante, at 13, and to the\napparent language of the statute, a hearing officer does not always\nrender a decision \u201con substantive grounds based on a determination of\nwhether the child received a free appropriate public education.\u201d\n\u00a71415(f)(3)(E)(i) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). That provision is \u201c[s]ubject to\nclause (ii),\u201d ibid., which provides that \u201c[i]n matters alleging a proce\ndural violation\u201d a hearing officer can grant relief if \u201cthe procedural\ninadequacies . . . significantly impeded the parents\u2019 opportunity to\nparticipate in the decisionmaking process regarding the provision of a\nfree appropriate public education to the parents\u2019 child,\u201d\n\u00a71415(f)(3)(E)(ii)(II). It is true that a hearing officer who accepts such\n6           WINKELMAN v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DIST.\n\n                           Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nsections about like buckshot cannot create a substantive\nparental right to education where none exists.\n    Harkening back to its earlier discussion of the IDEA\u2019s\n\u201ctext and structure\u201d (by which it means the statute\u2019s\nprocedural protections), the Court announces the startling\nproposition that, in fact, the \u201cIDEA does not differentiate\n. . . between the rights accorded to children and the rights\naccorded to parents.\u201d Ante, at 13. If that were so, the\nCourt could have spared us its painful effort to craft a\ndistinctive parental right out of scattered procedural\nprovisions. But of course it is not so. The IDEA quite\nclearly differentiates between the rights accorded to par\nents and their children. See Emery v. Roanoke City School\nBd., 432 F. 3d 294, 299 (CA4 2005) (\u201c[P]arents and chil\ndren are distinct legal entities under the IDEA\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). As even petitioners\u2019 amici\nagree, \u201cCongress specifically indicated that parents have\nrights under the Act that are separate from and independ\nent of their children\u2019s rights.\u201d Brief for Senator Edward\nM. Kennedy et al. as Amici Curiae 18. Does the Court\nseriously contend that a child has a right to reimburse\nment, when the statute most definitively provides that if\n\u201cthe parents of a child with a disability\u201d enroll that child in\nprivate school, \u201ca court . . . may require the [school dis\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nan allegation nominally grants relief by concluding that the child did\nnot receive a FAPE, \u00a71415(f)(3)(E)(ii), but it is clear from the structure\nof the statute that this is not a decision on the substantive adequacy of\nthe FAPE, but rather the label attached to a finding of procedural\ndefect. Petitioners agree with me on this point. See Brief for Petition\ners 31, n. 23. See also 20 U. S. C. \u00a71415(f)(3)(E)(iii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV)\n(\u201cNothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to preclude a hear\ning officer from ordering a local educational agency to comply with\nprocedural requirements under this section\u201d). In any event, even if a\nhearing officer was required to render a decision on the substantive\nadequacy of the FAPE, that feature of the statute still gives no clue as\nto whether parents\u2019 vindication of that substantive right at the admin\nistrative stage is on their own behalf or on behalf of the child.\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

Kennedy\net al. as Amici Curiae 21 (\u201cThe right of reimbursement\nruns to the parents\u201d). Does the Court believe that a child\nhas a procedural right under \u00a7\u00a71414(d)(1)(C)(i)\u2013(iii) (2000\ned., Supp. IV), which gives parents the power to excuse an\nIEP team member from attending an IEP meeting? The\nIDEA does not remotely envision communal \u201cfamily\u201d\nrights.\n   The Court believes that because parents must prove the\nsubstantive inadequacy of a FAPE before obtaining reim\nbursement, \u00a71412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), and\nbecause the suitability of a FAPE may also be at issue\nwhen procedural violations are alleged, \u00a71415(f)(3)(E)(ii),\nit is \u201cout of accord with the statute\u2019s design\u201d to \u201cprevent\n[parents] from obtaining a judgment mandating that the\nschool district provide their child\u201d with a FAPE. Ante, at\n14. That is a total non sequitur. That Congress has re\nquired parents to demonstrate the inadequacy of their\nchild\u2019s FAPE in order to vindicate their own rights says\nnothing about whether parents possess an underlying\nright to education. The Court insists that the right to a\nFAPE is the right \u201cmost fundamental to the Act.\u201d Ante, at\n12. Undoubtedly so, but that sheds no light upon whom\nthe right belongs to, and hence upon who can sue in their\nown right. Congress has used the phrase \u201cparty ag\ngrieved,\u201d and it is this Court\u2019s job to apply that language,\nnot to run from it.\n   The Court further believes that a distinction between\nparental and child rights will prove difficult to administer.\nI fail to see why that is so. Before today, the majority of\nFederal Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue\nhave allowed parents to sue pro se with respect to some\nclaims, but not with respect to the denial of a FAPE. See\nMosely v. Board of Ed. of Chicago, 434 F. 3d 527, 532 (CA7\n8        WINKELMAN v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DIST.\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n2006); Collingsru, 161 F. 3d, at 233; Wenger v. Canastota\nCentral School Dist., 146 F. 3d 123, 126 (CA2 1998) (per\ncuriam); Devine v. Indian River Cty. School Bd., 121 F. 3d\n576, 581, n. 17 (CA11 1997). The Court points to no evi\ndence suggesting that this majority rule has caused any\nconfusion in practice. Nor do I see how it could, since the\nstatute makes clear and easily administrable distinctions\nbetween parents\u2019 and children\u2019s legal entitlements.\n  Finally, the Court charges that the approach taken by\nthe majority of Courts of Appeals would perpetrate an\n\u201cinjustice,\u201d ante, at 15, since parents who do not seek\nreimbursement or allege procedural violations would be\n\u201cwithout a remedy,\u201d ante, at 14\u201315. That, of course, is not\ntrue. They will have the same remedy as all parents who\nsue to vindicate their children\u2019s rights: the power to bring\nsuit, represented by counsel. But even indulging the\nCourt\u2019s perception that it is unfair to allow some but not\nall IDEA parents to proceed pro se, that complaint is\nproperly addressed to Congress, which structured the\nrights as it has, and limited suit to \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d And\nthere are good reasons for it to have done so. Pro se cases\nimpose unique burdens on lower courts\u2014and on defen\ndants, in this case the schools and school districts that\nmust hire their own lawyers. Since pro se complaints are\nprosecuted essentially for free, without screening by\nknowledgeable attorneys, they are much more likely to be\nunmeritorious. And for courts to figure them out without\nthe assistance of plaintiff\u2019s counsel is much more difficult\nand time-consuming. In both categories of pro se parental\nsuit permitted under a proper interpretation of the stat\nute, one or the other of these burdens is reduced. Actions\nseeking reimbursement are less likely to be frivolous,\nsince not many parents will be willing to lay out the\nmoney for private education without some solid reason to\nbelieve the FAPE was inadequate. And actions alleging\nprocedural violations can ordinarily be disposed of without\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

They had sought review related to concerns they had over whether their youngest child, 6-year-old Jacob, would progress well at Pleasant Valley Elementary School, which is part of the Parma City School District in Parma, Ohio.</p>\n<p>Jacob has autism spectrum disorder and is covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Act or IDEA), 84 Stat. 175, as amended, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). His parents worked with the school district to develop an individualized education program (IEP), as required by the Act. All concede that Jacob's parents had the statutory right to contribute to this process and, when agreement could not be reached, to participate in administrative proceedings including what the Act refers to as an \"impartial due process hearing.\" \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>The disagreement at the center of the current dispute concerns the procedures to be followed when parents and their child, dissatisfied with the outcome of the due process hearing, seek further review in a United States District Court. The question is whether parents, either on their own behalf or as representatives of the child, may proceed in court unrepresented by counsel though they are not trained or licensed as attorneys. Resolution of this issue requires us to examine and explain the provisions of IDEA to determine if it accords to parents rights of their own that can be vindicated in court proceedings, or alternatively, whether the Act allows them, in their status as parents, to represent their child in court proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Respondent Parma City School District, a participant in IDEA's educational spending program, accepts federal funds for assistance in the education of children with disabilities. As a condition of receiving funds, it must comply with IDEA's mandates. IDEA requires that the school district provide Jacob with a \"free appropriate public education,\" which must operate in accordance with the IEP that Jacob's parents, along with school officials and other individuals, develop as members of Jacob's \"IEP Team.\" Brief for Petitioners 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The school district proposed an IEP for the 2003-2004 school year that would have placed Jacob at a public elementary school. Regarding this IEP as deficient under IDEA, Jacob's nonlawyer parents availed themselves of the administrative review provided by IDEA. They filed a complaint alleging respondent had failed to provide Jacob with a free appropriate public education; they appealed the hearing officer's rejection of the claims in this complaint to a state-level review officer; and after losing that appeal they filed, on their own behalf and on behalf of Jacob, a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In reliance upon 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) they challenged the administrative decision, alleging, among other matters: that Jacob had not been provided with a free appropriate public education; that his IEP was inadequate; and that the school district had failed to follow procedures mandated by IDEA. Pending the resolution of these challenges, the Winkelmans had enrolled Jacob in a private school at their own expense. They had also obtained counsel to assist them with certain aspects of the proceedings, although they filed their federal complaint, and later their appeal, without the aid of an attorney. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1999</span> Winkelmans' complaint sought reversal of the administrative decision, reimbursement for private-school expenditures and attorney's fees already incurred, and, it appears, declaratory relief.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted respondent's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding it had provided Jacob with a free appropriate public education. Petitioners, proceeding without counsel, filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Relying on its recent decision in <i>Cavanaugh v. Cardinal Local School Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790425\"><a href=\"/opinion/790425/david-and-bonnie-cavanaugh-for-the-minor-child-kyl/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span> (2005), the Court of Appeals entered an order dismissing the Winkelmans' appeal unless they obtained counsel to represent Jacob. See Order in No. 05-3886 (Nov. 4, 2005), App. A to Pet. for Cert. 1a. In <i>Cavanaugh</i> the Court of Appeals had rejected the proposition that IDEA allows nonlawyer parents raising IDEA claims to proceed <i>pro se</i> in federal court. The court ruled that the right to a free appropriate public education \"belongs to the child alone,\" 409 F.3d, at 757, not to both the parents and the child. It followed, the court held, that \"any right on which the [parents] could proceed on their own behalf would be derivative\" of the child's right, <i>ibid.,</i> so that parents bringing IDEA claims were not appearing on their own behalf, <i>ibid.</i> See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654 (allowing parties to prosecute their own claims <i>pro se</i>). As for the parents' alternative argument, the court held, nonlawyer parents cannot litigate IDEA claims on behalf of their child because IDEA does not abrogate the common-law rule prohibiting nonlawyer parents from representing minor children. 409 F.3d, at 756. As the court in <i>Cavanaugh</i> acknowledged, its decision brought the Sixth Circuit in direct conflict with the First Circuit, which had concluded, under a theory of \"statutory joint rights,\" that the Act accords to parents the right to assert IDEA claims on their own behalf.

Petitioners' primary theory is that the Act makes parents real parties in interest to IDEA actions, not \"mer[e] guardians of their children's rights.\" Brief for Petitioners 16. If correct, this allows Mr. and Mrs. Winkelman back into court, for there is no question that a party may represent his or her own interests in federal court without the aid of counsel. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654 (\"In all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel ...\"). Petitioners cannot cite a specific provision in IDEA mandating in direct and explicit terms that parents have the status of real parties in interest. They instead base their argument on a comprehensive reading of IDEA. Taken as a whole, they contend, the Act leads to the necessary conclusion that parents have independent, enforceable rights.

Respondent, accusing petitioners of \"knit[ting] together various provisions pulled from the crevices of the statute\" to support these claims, Brief for Respondent 19, reads the text of IDEA to mean that any redressable rights under the Act belong only to children, <i>id.,</i> at 19-40.</p>\n<p>We agree that the text of IDEA resolves the question presented. We recognize, in addition, that a proper interpretation of the Act requires a consideration of the entire statutory scheme. See <i>Dolan v. Postal Service,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145678\"><a href=\"/opinion/145678/dolan-v-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span>, 486, 126 S.Ct. 1252, 163 L.Ed.2d 1079 (2006). Turning to the current version of IDEA, which the parties agree governs this case, we begin with an overview of the relevant statutory provisions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The goals of IDEA include \"ensur[ing] that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education\" and \"ensur[ing] that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A)-(B) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). To this end, the Act includes provisions governing four areas of particular relevance to the Winkelmans' claim: procedures to be followed when developing a child's IEP; criteria governing the sufficiency of an education provided to a child; mechanisms for review that must be made available when there are objections to the IEP or to other aspects of IDEA proceedings; and the requirement in certain circumstances that States reimburse parents for various expenses. See generally \u00a7\u00a7 1412(a)(10), 1414, 1415. Although our discussion of these four areas does not identify all the illustrative provisions, we do take particular note of certain terms that mandate or otherwise describe parental involvement.</p>\n<p>IDEA requires school districts to develop an IEP for each child with a disability, see \u00a7\u00a7 1412(a)(4), 1414(d), with parents playing \"a significant role\" in this process, <i>Schaffer v. Weast,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1993216\"><a href=\"/opinion/1993216/schaffer-v-weast/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 53, 126 S.Ct. 528, 163 L.Ed.2d 387 (2005). Parents serve as members of the team that develops the IEP. \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(B). The \"concerns\" parents have \"for enhancing the education of their child\" must be considered by the team. \u00a7 1414(d)(3)(A)(ii). IDEA accords parents additional protections that apply throughout the IEP process. See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1414(d)(4)(A) (requiring the IEP Team to revise the IEP when appropriate to address certain information provided by the parents); \u00a7 1414(e) (requiring States to \"ensure that the parents of [a child with a disability] are members of any group that makes decisions on the educational placement of their child\"). The statute also sets up general procedural safeguards that protect the informed involvement of parents in the development of an education for their child. See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1415(a) (requiring States to \"establish and maintain procedures ... to ensure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education\"); \u00a7 1415(b)(1) (mandating that States provide an opportunity for parents to examine all relevant records). See generally \u00a7\u00a7 1414, 1415. A central purpose of the parental protections is to facilitate the provision of a \"`free appropriate public education,'\" \u00a7 1401(9), which must be made available to the child \"in conformity with the [IEP],\" \u00a7 1401(9)(D).</p>\n<p>The Act defines a \"free appropriate public education\" pursuant to an IEP to be an educational instruction \"specially designed... to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability,\" \u00a7 1401(29), coupled with any additional \"`related services'\" that are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2001</span> \"required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from [that instruction],\" \u00a7 1401(26)(A). See also \u00a7 1401(9). The education must, among other things, be provided \"under public supervision and direction,\" \"meet the standards of the State educational agency,\" and \"include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school education in the State involved.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The instruction must, in addition, be provided at \"no cost to parents.\" \u00a7 1401(29). See generally <i>Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span>, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982) (discussing the meaning of \"free appropriate public education\" as used in the statutory precursor to IDEA).</p>\n<p>When a party objects to the adequacy of the education provided, the construction of the IEP, or some related matter, IDEA provides procedural recourse: It requires that a State provide \"[a]n opportunity for any party to present a complaint ... with respect to any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.\" \u00a7 1415(b)(6). By presenting a complaint a party is able to pursue a process of review that, as relevant, begins with a preliminary meeting \"where the parents of the child discuss their complaint\" and the local educational agency \"is provided the opportunity to [reach a resolution].\" \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i)(IV). If the agency \"has not resolved the complaint to the satisfaction of the parents within 30 days,\" \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(ii), the parents may request an \"impartial due process hearing,\" \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(A), which must be conducted either by the local educational agency or by the state educational agency, <i>ibid.,</i> and where a hearing officer will resolve issues raised in the complaint, \u00a7 1415(f)(3).</p>\n<p>IDEA sets standards the States must follow in conducting these hearings. Among other things, it indicates that the hearing officer's decision \"shall be made on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education,\" and that, \"[i]n matters alleging a procedural violation,\" the officer may find a child \"did not receive a free appropriate public education\" only if the violation</p>\n<blockquote>\"(I) impeded the child's right to a free appropriate public education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(II) significantly impeded the parents' opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process regarding the provision of a free appropriate public education to the parents' child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(III) caused a deprivation of educational benefits.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(i)-(ii).</blockquote>\n<p>If the local educational agency, rather than the state educational agency, conducts this hearing, then \"any party aggrieved by the findings and decision rendered in such a hearing may appeal such findings and decision to the State educational agency.\" \u00a7 1415(g)(1). Once the state educational agency has reached its decision, an aggrieved party may commence suit in federal court: \"Any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made [by the hearing officer] shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint.\" \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A); see also \u00a7 1415(i)(1).</p>\n<p>IDEA, finally, provides for at least two means of cost recovery that inform our analysis. First, in certain circumstances it allows a court or hearing officer to require a state agency \"to reimburse the parents [of a child with a disability] for the cost of [private school] enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child.\" \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). Second, it sets forth rules governing when and to what extent a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2002</span> court may award attorney's fees. See \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B). Included in this section is a provision allowing an award \"to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.\" \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(I).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioners construe these various provisions to accord parents independent, enforceable rights under IDEA. We agree. The parents enjoy enforceable rights at the administrative stage, and it would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme to bar them from continuing to assert these rights in federal court.</p>\n<p>The statute sets forth procedures for resolving disputes in a manner that, in the Act's express terms, contemplates parents will be the parties bringing the administrative complaints. In addition to the provisions we have cited, we refer also to \u00a7 1415(b)(8) (requiring a state educational agency to \"develop a model form to assist parents in filing a complaint\"); \u00a7 1415(c)(2) (addressing the response an agency must provide to a \"parent's due process complaint notice\"); and \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i) (referring to \"the parent's complaint\"). A wide range of review is available: Administrative complaints may be brought with respect to \"any matter relating to ... the provision of a free appropriate public education.\" \u00a7 1415(b)(6)(A). Claims raised in these complaints are then resolved at impartial due process hearings, where, again, the statute makes clear that parents will be participating as parties. See generally <i>supra,</i> at 2001. See also \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(C) (indicating \"[a] parent or agency shall request an impartial due process hearing\" within a certain period of time); \u00a7 1415(e)(2)(A)(ii) (referring to \"a parent's right to a due process hearing\"). The statute then grants \"[a]ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision made [by the hearing officer] ... the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint.\" \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>Nothing in these interlocking provisions excludes a parent who has exercised his or her own rights from statutory protection the moment the administrative proceedings end. Put another way, the Act does not <i>sub silentio</i> or by implication bar parents from seeking to vindicate the rights accorded to them once the time comes to file a civil action. Through its provisions for expansive review and extensive parental involvement, the statute leads to just the opposite result.</p>\n<p>Respondent, resisting this line of analysis, asks us to read these provisions as contemplating parental involvement only to the extent parents represent their child's interests. In respondent's view IDEA accords parents nothing more than \"collateral tools related to the child's underlying substantive rights \u0097 not freestanding or independently enforceable rights.\" Brief for Respondent 25.</p>\n<p>This interpretation, though, is foreclosed by provisions of the statute. IDEA defines one of its purposes as seeking \"to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\" \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(B). The word \"rights\" in the quoted language refers to the rights of parents as well as the rights of the child; otherwise the grammatical structure would make no sense.</p>\n<p>Further provisions confirm this view. IDEA mandates that educational agencies establish procedures \"to ensure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education.\" \u00a7 1415(a). It presumes parents have rights of their own when it defines how States might provide for the transfer of the \"rights accorded to parents\" by IDEA, \u00a7 1415(m)(1)(B), and it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2003</span> prohibits the raising of certain challenges \"[n]otwithstanding any other individual right of action that a parent or student may maintain under [the relevant provisions of IDEA],\" \u00a7\u00a7 1401(10)(E), 1412(a)(14)(E). To adopt respondent's reading of the statute would require an interpretation of these statutory provisions (and others) far too strained to be correct.</p>\n<p>Defending its countertextual reading of the statute, respondent cites a decision by a Court of Appeals concluding that the Act's \"references to parents are best understood as accommodations to the fact of the child's incapacity.\" <i>Doe v. Board of Ed. of Baltimore Cty.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></span>, 263 (C.A.4 1998); see also Brief for Respondent 30. This, according to respondent, requires us to interpret all references to parents' rights as referring in implicit terms to the child's rights \u0097 which, under this view, are the only enforceable rights accorded by IDEA. Even if we were inclined to ignore the plain text of the statute in considering this theory, we disagree that the sole purpose driving IDEA's involvement of parents is to facilitate vindication of a child's rights. It is not a novel proposition to say that parents have a recognized legal interest in the education and upbringing of their child. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Pierce v. Society of Sisters,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100694\"><a href=\"/opinion/100694/pierce-v-society-of-sisters/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 534-535, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) (acknowledging \"the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control\"); <i>Meyer v. Nebraska,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100233\"><a href=\"/opinion/100233/meyer-v-nebraska/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 399-401, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923). There is no necessary bar or obstacle in the law, then, to finding an intention by Congress to grant parents a stake in the entitlements created by IDEA. Without question a parent of a child with a disability has a particular and personal interest in fulfilling \"our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.\" \u00a7 1400(c)(1).</p>\n<p>We therefore find no reason to read into the plain language of the statute an implicit rejection of the notion that Congress would accord parents independent, enforceable rights concerning the education of their children. We instead interpret the statute's references to parents' rights to mean what they say: that IDEA includes provisions conveying rights to parents as well as to children.</p>\n<p>A variation on respondent's argument has persuaded some Courts of Appeals. The argument is that while a parent can be a \"party aggrieved\" for aspects of the hearing officer's findings and decision, he or she cannot be a \"party aggrieved\" with respect to all IDEA-based challenges. Under this view the causes of action available to a parent might relate, for example, to various procedural mandates, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Collinsgru,</i> 161 F.3d, at 233, and reimbursement demands, see, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). The argument supporting this conclusion proceeds as follows: Because a \"party aggrieved\" is, by definition, entitled to a remedy, and parents are, under IDEA, only entitled to certain procedures and reimbursements as remedies, a parent cannot be a \"party aggrieved\" with regard to any claim not implicating these limited matters.</p>\n<p>This argument is contradicted by the statutory provisions we have recited. True, there are provisions in IDEA stating parents are entitled to certain procedural protections and reimbursements; but the statute prevents us from placing too much weight on the implications to be drawn when other entitlements are accorded in less clear language. We find little support for the inference that parents are excluded by implication whenever a child is mentioned, and vice versa. Compare, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1411(e)(3)(E) (barring States from using <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2004</span> certain funds for costs associated with actions \"brought on behalf of a child\" but failing to acknowledge that actions might also be brought on behalf of a parent) with \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i) (allowing recovery of attorney's fees to a \"prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability\" but failing to acknowledge that a child might also be a prevailing party). Without more, then, the language in IDEA confirming that parents enjoy particular procedural and reimbursement-related rights does not resolve whether they are also entitled to enforce IDEA's other mandates, including the one most fundamental to the Act: the provision of a free appropriate public education to a child with a disability.</p>\n<p>We consider the statutory structure. The IEP proceedings entitle parents to participate not only in the implementation of IDEA's procedures but also in the substantive formulation of their child's educational program. Among other things, IDEA requires the IEP Team, which includes the parents as members, to take into account any \"concerns\" parents have \"for enhancing the education of their child\" when it formulates the IEP. \u00a7 1414(d)(3)(A)(ii). The IEP, in turn, sets the boundaries of the central entitlement provided by IDEA: It defines a \"`free appropriate public education'\" for that parent's child. \u00a7 1401(9).</p>\n<p>The statute also empowers parents to bring challenges based on a broad range of issues. The parent may seek a hearing on \"any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.\" \u00a7 1415(b)(6)(A). To resolve these challenges a hearing officer must make a decision based on whether the child \"received a free appropriate public education.\" \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E). When this hearing has been conducted by a local educational agency rather than a state educational agency, \"any party aggrieved by the findings and decision rendered in such a hearing may appeal such findings and decision\" to the state educational agency. \u00a7 1415(g)(1). Judicial review follows, authorized by a broadly worded provision phrased in the same terms used to describe the prior stage of review: \"[a]ny party aggrieved\" may bring \"a civil action.\" \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>These provisions confirm that IDEA, through its text and structure, creates in parents an independent stake not only in the procedures and costs implicated by this process but also in the substantive decisions to be made. We therefore conclude that IDEA does not differentiate, through isolated references to various procedures and remedies, between the rights accorded to children and the rights accorded to parents. As a consequence, a parent may be a \"party aggrieved\" for purposes of \u00a7 1415(i)(2) with regard to \"any matter\" implicating these rights. See \u00a7 1415(b)(6)(A). The status of parents as parties is not limited to matters that relate to procedure and cost recovery. To find otherwise would be inconsistent with the collaborative framework and expansive system of review established by the Act. Cf. <i>Cedar Rapids Community School Dist. v. Garret F.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118269\"><a href=\"/opinion/118269/cedar-rapids-community-school-dist-v-garret-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 73, 119 S.Ct. 992, 143 L.Ed.2d 154 (1999) (looking to IDEA's \"overall statutory scheme\" to interpret its provisions).</p>\n<p>Our conclusion is confirmed by noting the incongruous results that would follow were we to accept the proposition that parents' IDEA rights are limited to certain nonsubstantive matters. The statute's procedural and reimbursement-related rights are intertwined with the substantive adequacy of the education provided to a child, see, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E), see also \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii), and it is difficult to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2005</span> disentangle the provisions in order to conclude that some rights adhere to both parent and child while others do not. Were we nevertheless to recognize a distinction of this sort it would impose upon parties a confusing and onerous legal regime, one worsened by the absence of any express guidance in IDEA concerning how a court might in practice differentiate between these matters. It is, in addition, out of accord with the statute's design to interpret the Act to require that parents prove the substantive inadequacy of their child's education as a predicate for obtaining, for example, reimbursement under \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii), yet to prevent them from obtaining a judgment mandating that the school district provide their child with an educational program demonstrated to be an appropriate one. The adequacy of the educational program is, after all, the central issue in the litigation. The provisions of IDEA do not set forth these distinctions, and we decline to infer them.</p>\n<p>The bifurcated regime suggested by the courts that have employed it, moreover, leaves some parents without a remedy. The statute requires, in express terms, that States provide a child with a free appropriate public education \"at public expense,\" \u00a7 1401(9)(A), including specially designed instruction \"at no cost to parents,\" \u00a7 1401(29). Parents may seek to enforce this mandate through the federal courts, we conclude, because among the rights they enjoy is the right to a free appropriate public education for their child. Under the countervailing view, which would make a parent's ability to enforce IDEA dependant on certain procedural and reimbursement-related rights, a parent whose disabled child has not received a free appropriate public education would have recourse in the federal courts only under two circumstances: when the parent happens to have some claim related to the procedures employed; and when he or she is able to incur, and has in fact incurred, expenses creating a right to reimbursement. Otherwise the adequacy of the child's education would not be regarded as relevant to any cause of action the parent might bring; and, as a result, only the child could vindicate the right accorded by IDEA to a free appropriate public education.</p>\n<p>The potential for injustice in this result is apparent. What is more, we find nothing in the statute to indicate that when Congress required States to provide adequate instruction to a child \"at no cost to parents,\" it intended that only some parents would be able to enforce that mandate. The statute instead takes pains to \"ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\" \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(B). See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1415(e)(2) (requiring that States implement procedures to ensure parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education); \u00a7 1415(e)(2)(A)(ii) (requiring that mediation procedures not be \"used to deny or delay a parent's right to a due process hearing ... or to deny any other rights afforded under this subchapter\"); cf. \u00a7 1400(c)(3) (noting IDEA's success in \"ensuring children with disabilities and the families of such children access to a free appropriate public education\").</p>\n<p>We conclude IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights. These rights, which are not limited to certain procedural and reimbursement-related matters, encompass the entitlement to a free appropriate public education for the parents' child.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Respondent contends, though, that even under the reasoning we have now explained petitioners cannot prevail without <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2006</span> overcoming a further difficulty. Citing our opinion in <i>Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy,</i> 548 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2455, 165 L.Ed.2d 526 (2006), respondent argues that statutes passed pursuant to the Spending Clause, such as IDEA, must provide \"`clear notice'\" before they can burden a State with some new condition, obligation, or liability. Brief for Respondent 41. Respondent contends that because IDEA is, at best, ambiguous as to whether it accords parents independent rights, it has failed to provide clear notice of this condition to the States. See <i>id.,</i> at 40-49.</p>\n<p>Respondent's reliance on <i>Arlington</i> is misplaced. In <i>Arlington</i> we addressed whether IDEA required States to reimburse experts' fees to prevailing parties in IDEA actions. \"[W]hen Congress attaches conditions to a State's acceptance of federal funds,\" we explained, \"the conditions must be set out `unambiguously.'\" 548 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2459 (quoting <i>Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110458\"><a href=\"/opinion/110458/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981)). The question to be answered in <i>Arlington,</i> therefore, was whether IDEA \"furnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue.\" 548 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2459. We found it did not.</p>\n<p>The instant case presents a different issue, one that does not invoke the same rule. Our determination that IDEA grants to parents independent, enforceable rights does not impose any substantive condition or obligation on States they would not otherwise be required by law to observe. The basic measure of monetary recovery, moreover, is not expanded by recognizing that some rights repose in both the parent and the child. Were we considering a statute other than the one before us, the Spending Clause argument might have more force: A determination by the Court that some distinct class of people has independent, enforceable rights might result in a change to the States' statutory obligations. But that is not the case here.</p>\n<p>Respondent argues our ruling will, as a practical matter, increase costs borne by the States as they are forced to defend against suits unconstrained by attorneys trained in the law and the rules of ethics. Effects such as these do not suffice to invoke the concerns under the Spending Clause. Furthermore, IDEA does afford relief for the States in certain cases. The Act empowers courts to award attorney's fees to a prevailing educational agency whenever a parent has presented a \"complaint or subsequent cause of action ... for any improper purpose, such as to harass, to cause unnecessary delay, or to needlessly increase the cost of litigation.\" \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(III). This provision allows some relief when a party has proceeded in violation of these standards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals erred when it dismissed the Winkelmans' appeal for lack of counsel. Parents enjoy rights under IDEA; and they are, as a result, entitled to prosecute IDEA claims on their own behalf. The decision by Congress to grant parents these rights was consistent with the purpose of IDEA and fully in accord with our social and legal traditions. It is beyond dispute that the relationship between a parent and child is sufficient to support a legally cognizable interest in the education of one's child; and, what is more, Congress has found that \"the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by ... strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2007</span> in the education of their children at school and at home.\" \u00a7 1400(c)(5).</p>\n<p>In light of our holding we need not reach petitioners' alternative argument, which concerns whether IDEA entitles parents to litigate their child's claims <i>pro se.</i></p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I would hold that parents have the right to proceed <i>pro se</i> under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), when they seek reimbursement for private school expenses or redress for violations of their own procedural rights, but not when they seek a judicial determination that their child's free appropriate public education (or FAPE) is substantively inadequate.</p>\n<p>Whether parents may bring suits under the IDEA without a lawyer depends upon the interaction between the IDEA and the general <i>pro se</i> provision in the Judiciary Act of 1789. The latter, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654, provides that \"[i]n all courts of the United States <i>the parties</i> may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel.\" (Emphasis added.) The IDEA's right-to-sue provision, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), provides that \"[a]ny <i>party aggrieved</i> by the findings and decision [of a hearing officer] shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the [administrative] complaint.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, when parents are \"parties aggrieved\" under the IDEA, they are \"parties\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654, entitled to sue on their own behalf.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>As both parties agree, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; Brief for Respondent 37, \"party aggrieved\" means \"[a] party entitled to a remedy; esp., a party whose personal, pecuniary, or property rights have been adversely affected by another person's actions or by a court's decree or judgment,\" Black's Law Dictionary 1154 (8th ed.2004); see also <i>ante,</i> at 2003-2004. This case thus turns on the rights that the IDEA accords to parents, and the concomitant remedies made available to them. Only with respect to such rights and remedies are parents properly viewed as \"parties aggrieved,\" capable of filing their own cases in federal court.</p>\n<p>A review of the statutory text makes clear that, as relevant here, the IDEA grants parents only two types of rights.<sup>[2]</sup> First, under certain circumstances \"a court or a hearing officer may require the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2008</span> [school district] to reimburse <i>the parents</i>\" for private school expenditures \"if the court or hearing officer finds that the [school district] had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added). Second, parents are accorded a variety of procedural protections, both during the development of their child's individualized education program (IEP), see, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(B)(i) (parents are members of their child's IEP team); \u00a7 1415(b)(1) (parents must have an opportunity to examine records and participate in IEP meetings), and in any subsequent administrative challenges, see, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7\u00a7 1415(b)(6), (8) (parents may file administrative due process complaints). It is clear that parents may object to procedural violations at the administrative due process hearing, see \u00a7 1415(b)(6)(A), and that a hearing officer may provide relief to parents for certain procedural infractions, see \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii). Because the rights to reimbursement and to the various procedural protections are accorded to parents themselves, they are \"parties aggrieved\" when those rights are infringed, and may accordingly proceed <i>pro se</i> when seeking to vindicate them.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court goes further, however, concluding that parents may proceed <i>pro se</i> not only when they seek reimbursement or assert procedural violations, but also when they challenge the substantive adequacy of their child's FAPE \u0097 so that parents may act without a lawyer <i>in every IDEA case.</i> See <i>ante,</i> at 2003-2006. In my view, this sweeps far more broadly than the text allows. Out of this sprawling statute the Court cannot identify even <i>a single</i> provision stating that parents have the substantive right to a FAPE. The reason for this is readily understandable: The right to a free appropriate public education obviously inheres in the child, for it is he who receives the education. As the IDEA instructs, participating States must provide a \"free appropriate public education ... to all children with disabilities ....\" \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The statute is replete with references to the fact that a FAPE belongs to the child. See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A) (IDEA designed \"to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education\"); \u00a7 1408(a)(2)(C)(i) (referring to \"the right of a child\" to \"receive a free appropriate public education\"); \u00a7 1411(e)(3)(F)(i) (same); \u00a7 1414(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) (referring to an agency \"that is responsible for making a free appropriate public education available to a child\"); \u00a7 1415(b)(6)(A) (referring to \"the provision of a free appropriate public education to [a] child\"). The parents of a disabled child no doubt have an <i>interest</i> in seeing their child receive a proper education. But there is a difference between an <i>interest</i> and a statutory <i>right.</i> The text of the IDEA makes clear that parents have no <i>right</i> to the education itself.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2009</span> The Court concedes, as it must, that while the IDEA gives parents the right to reimbursement and procedural protection in explicit terms, it does not do so for the supposed right to the education itself. <i>Ante,</i> at 2003-2004. The obvious inference to be drawn from the statute's clear and explicit conferral of discrete types of rights upon parents and children, respectively, is that it does not by accident confer the parent-designated rights upon children, or the children-designated rights upon parents. The Court believes, however, that \"the statute prevents us from placing too much weight on [this] implicatio[n].\" <i>Ibid.</i> That conclusion is in error. Nothing in \"the statute,\" undermines the obvious \"implication\" of Congress's scheme. What the Court relies upon for its conclusion that parents have a substantive right to a FAPE is not the \"statutory structure,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2004, but rather the myriad <i>procedural</i> guarantees accorded to parents in the administrative process, see <i>ibid.</i> But allowing parents, by means of these guarantees, to help shape the contours of their child's education is simply not the same as giving <i>them</i> the right to that education. Nor can the Court sensibly rely on the provisions governing due process hearings and administrative appeals, the various provisions that refer to the \"parent's complaint,\" see, <i>e.g.,</i> 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(III) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), or the fact that the right-to-sue provision, \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A), refers to the administrative complaint, which in turn allows parents to challenge \"any matter\" relating to the provision of a FAPE, \u00a7 1415(b)(6)(A). These provisions prove nothing except what all parties concede: that parents <i>may</i> represent their child <i>pro se</i> at the administrative level. See Brief for Petitioners 17-18, 40; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 12; Brief for Respondent 13, 44; see also <i>Collinsgru v. Palmyra Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759474\"><a href=\"/opinion/759474/robert-collinsgru-maura-collinsgru-on-behalf-of-th/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 232 (C.A.3 1998). Parents thus have the power, at the administrative stage, to litigate <i>all</i> of the various rights under the statute since at that stage they are acting not only on their <i>own</i> behalf, but on behalf of <i>their child</i> as well. This tells us nothing whatever about <i>whose</i> rights they are.<sup>[5]</sup> The Court's spraying statutory sections about like buckshot cannot create a substantive parental right to education where none exists.</p>\n<p>Harkening back to its earlier discussion of the IDEA's \"text and structure\" (by which it means the statute's procedural protections), the Court announces the startling <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2010</span> proposition that, in fact, the \"IDEA does not differentiate ... between the rights accorded to children and the rights accorded to parents.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2004. If that were so, the Court could have spared us its painful effort to craft a distinctive parental right out of scattered procedural provisions. But of course it is not so. The IDEA quite clearly differentiates between the rights accorded to parents and their children. See <i>Emery v. Roanoke City School Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></span>, 299 (C.A.4 2005) (\"[P]arents and children are distinct legal entities under the IDEA\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). As even petitioners' <i>amici</i> agree, \"Congress specifically indicated that parents have rights under the Act that are separate from and independent of their children's rights.\" Brief for Senator Edward M. Kennedy et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 18. Does the Court seriously contend that a child has a right to reimbursement, when the statute most definitively provides that if \"<i>the parents</i> of a child with a disability\" enroll that child in private school, \"a court ... may require the [school district] to reimburse <i>the parents</i> for the cost of that enrollment\"? \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added); see also Brief for Senator Edward M. Kennedy et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 21 (\"The right of reimbursement runs to the parents\"). Does the Court believe that a child has a procedural right under \u00a7\u00a7 1414(d)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which gives <i>parents</i> the power to excuse an IEP team member from attending an IEP meeting? The IDEA does not remotely envision communal \"family\" rights.</p>\n<p>The Court believes that because parents must prove the substantive inadequacy of a FAPE before obtaining reimbursement, \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), and because the suitability of a FAPE may also be at issue when procedural violations are alleged, \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii), it is \"out of accord with the statute's design\" to \"prevent [parents] from obtaining a judgment mandating that the school district provide their child\" with a FAPE. <i>Ante,</i> at 2004-2005. That is a total non sequitur. That Congress has required parents to demonstrate the inadequacy of their child's FAPE in order to vindicate their own rights says nothing about whether parents possess an underlying right to education. The Court insists that the right to a FAPE is the right \"most fundamental to the Act.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2003-2004. Undoubtedly so, but that sheds no light upon whom the right belongs to, and hence upon who can sue in their own right. Congress has used the phrase \"party aggrieved,\" and it is this Court's job to apply that language, not to run from it.</p>\n<p>The Court further believes that a distinction between parental and child rights will prove difficult to administer. I fail to see why that is so. Before today, the majority of Federal Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue have allowed parents to sue <i>pro se</i> with respect to some claims, but not with respect to the denial of a FAPE. See <i>Mosely v. Board of Ed. of Chicago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792936\"><a href=\"/opinion/792936/lillian-l-mosely-v-board-of-education-of-the-city-/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>, 532 (C.A.7 2006); <i>Collinsgru,</i> 161 F.3d, at 233; <i>Wenger v. Canastota Central School Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755154\"><a href=\"/opinion/755154/walter-sj-wenger-v-canastota-central-school-distri/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, 126 (C.A.2 1998) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Devine v. Indian River Cty. School Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72184\"><a href=\"/opinion/72184/devine-v-indian-river-cty-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 581, n. 17 (C.A.11 1997). The Court points to no evidence suggesting that this majority rule has caused any confusion in practice. Nor do I see how it could, since the statute makes clear and easily administrable distinctions between parents' and children's legal entitlements.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court charges that the approach taken by the majority of Courts of Appeals would perpetrate an \"injustice,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2005, since parents who do not seek reimbursement or allege procedural violations would be \"without a remedy,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2004-2005. That, of course, is not true. They will have the same remedy as all parents who sue to vindicate their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2011</span> children's rights: the power to bring suit, represented by counsel. But even indulging the Court's perception that it is unfair to allow some but not all IDEA parents to proceed <i>pro se,</i> that complaint is properly addressed to Congress, which structured the rights as it has, and limited suit to \"party aggrieved.\" And there are good reasons for it to have done so. <i>Pro se</i> cases impose unique burdens on lower courts \u0097 and on defendants, in this case the schools and school districts that must hire their own lawyers. Since <i>pro se</i> complaints are prosecuted essentially for free, without screening by knowledgeable attorneys, they are much more likely to be unmeritorious. And for courts to figure them out without the assistance of plaintiff's counsel is much more difficult and time-consuming. In both categories of <i>pro se</i> parental suit permitted under a proper interpretation of the statute, one or the other of these burdens is reduced. Actions seeking reimbursement are less likely to be frivolous, since not many parents will be willing to lay out the money for private education without some solid reason to believe the FAPE was inadequate. And actions alleging procedural violations can ordinarily be disposed of without the intensive record-review that characterizes suits challenging the suitability of a FAPE.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Petitioners sought reimbursement, alleged procedural violations, and requested a declaration that their child's FAPE was substantively inadequate. <i>Ante,</i> at 1998-1999. I agree with the Court that they may proceed <i>pro se</i> with respect to the first two claims, but I disagree that they may do so with respect to the third.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  As the Court notes, <i>ante,</i> at 1998, 2006-2007, petitioners also argue that even if parents do not have their own rights under the statute, they nonetheless may act on behalf of their child without retaining a lawyer. Both sides agree, however, that the common law generally prohibited lay parents from representing their children in court, a manifestation of the more general common-law rule that nonattorneys cannot litigate the interests of another. See Brief for Petitioners 37; Brief for Respondent 9-10; see also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Collinsgru v. Palmyra Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759474\"><a href=\"/opinion/759474/robert-collinsgru-maura-collinsgru-on-behalf-of-th/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 232 (C.A.3 1998). Nothing in the IDEA suggests a departure from that rule.</p>\n<p>[2]  Because the grant of those rights is clear, and because I find no statutory basis for any other rights, I need not decide whether the Spending Clause's \"clear notice\" requirement is applicable here. Cf. <i>Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy,</i> 548 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 2455, 2459, 165 L.Ed.2d 526 (2006).</p>\n<p>[3]  Of course when parents assert procedural violations, they must also allege that those violations adversely affected the outcome of the proceedings. Under Article III, one does not have standing to challenge a procedural violation without having some concrete interest in the outcome of the proceeding to which the violation pertains, see <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 571-578, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992), here the parents' interest in having their child receive an appropriate education.</p>\n<p>[4]  Nor can a parental right to education be justified, as the Court attempts, see <i>ante,</i> at 2004-2005, on the theory that the IDEA gives parents a legal right to <i>free</i> schooling for their child. Parents acquire such a right (in limited circumstances) only when they enroll their child in a private institution. \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>[5]  Contrary to indications in the Court's opinion, <i>ante,</i> at 2004, and to the apparent language of the statute, a hearing officer does not always render a decision \"on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education.\" \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(i) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). That provision is \"[s]ubject to clause (ii),\" <i>ibid.,</i> which provides that \"[i]n matters alleging a procedural violation\" a hearing officer can grant relief if \"the procedural inadequacies ... significantly impeded the parents' opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process regarding the provision of a free appropriate public education to the parents' child,\" \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii)(II). It is true that a hearing officer who accepts such an allegation nominally grants relief by concluding that the child did not receive a FAPE, \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii), but it is clear from the structure of the statute that this is not a decision on the substantive adequacy of the FAPE, but rather the label attached to a finding of procedural defect. Petitioners agree with me on this point. See Brief for Petitioners 31, n. 23. See also 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(iii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (\"Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to preclude a hearing officer from ordering a local educational agency to comply with procedural requirements under this section\"). In any event, even if a hearing officer was required to render a decision on the substantive adequacy of the FAPE, that feature of the statute still gives no clue as to whether parents' vindication of that substantive right at the administrative stage is on their own behalf or on behalf of the child.</p>\n\n</div>",
