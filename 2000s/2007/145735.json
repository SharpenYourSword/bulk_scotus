Fleming, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, Washington, DC, Brief for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to footnote 14.</p>\n<p>It is the general rule under United States patent law that no infringement occurs when a patented product is made and sold in another country. There is an exception. Section 271(f) of the Patent Act, adopted in 1984, provides that infringement does occur when one \"supplies... from the United States,\" for \"combination\" abroad, a patented invention's \"components.\" 35 U.S.C. ß 271(f)(1). This case concerns the applicability of ß 271(f) to computer software first sent from the United States to a foreign manufacturer on a master disk, or by electronic transmission, then copied by the foreign recipient for installation on computers made and sold abroad.</p>\n<p>AT &amp; T holds a patent on an apparatus for digitally encoding and compressing recorded speech. Microsoft's Windows operating system, it is conceded, has the potential to infringe AT &amp; T's patent, because Windows incorporates software code that, when installed, enables a computer to process speech in the manner claimed by that patent. It bears emphasis, however, that uninstalled Windows software does not infringe AT &amp; T's patent any more than a computer standing alone does; instead, the patent is infringed only when a computer is loaded with Windows and is thereby rendered capable of performing as the patented speech processor. The question before us: Does Microsoft's liability extend to computers made in another country when loaded with Windows software copied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1751</span> abroad from a master disk or electronic transmission dispatched by Microsoft from the United States? Our answer is \"No.\"</p>\n<p>The master disk or electronic transmission Microsoft sends from the United States is never installed on any of the foreign-made computers in question. Instead, copies made abroad are used for installation. Because Microsoft does not export from the United States the copies actually installed, it does not \"suppl[y] ... from the United States\" \"components\" of the relevant computers, and therefore is not liable under ß 271(f) as currently written.</p>\n<p>Plausible arguments can be made for and against extending ß 271(f) to the conduct charged in this case as infringing AT &amp; T's patent. Recognizing that ß 271(f) is an exception to the general rule that our patent law does not apply extraterritorially, we resist giving the language in which Congress cast ß 271(f) an expansive interpretation. Our decision leaves to Congress' informed judgment any adjustment of ß 271(f) it deems necessary or proper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Our decision some 35 years ago in <i>Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp.,</i> 406 U.S. 518, 92 S.Ct. 1700, 32 L.Ed.2d 273 (1972), a case about a shrimp deveining machine, led Congress to enact ß 271(f). In that case, Laitram, holder of a patent on the time-and-expense-saving machine, sued Deepsouth, manufacturer of an infringing deveiner. Deepsouth conceded that the Patent Act barred it from making and selling its deveining machine in the United States, but sought to salvage a portion of its business: Nothing in United States patent law, Deepsouth urged, stopped it from making in the United States the <i>parts</i> of its deveiner, as opposed to the machine itself, and selling those <i>parts</i> to foreign buyers for assembly and use abroad. <i>Id.,</i> at 522-524, 92 S.Ct. 1700.<sup>[1]</sup> We agreed.</p>\n<p>Interpreting our patent law as then written, we reiterated in <i>Deepsouth</i> that it was \"not an infringement to make or use a patented product outside of the United States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 527, 92 S.Ct. 1700; see 35 U.S.C. ß 271(a) (1970 ed.) (\"[W]hoever without authority makes, uses or sells any patented invention, within the United States during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent.\"). Deepsouth's foreign buyers did not infringe Laitram's patent, we held, because they assembled and used the deveining machines outside the United States. Deepsouth, we therefore concluded, could not be charged with inducing or contributing to an infringement. 406 U.S., at 526-527, 92 S.Ct. 1700.<sup>[2]</sup> Nor could Deepsouth be held liable as a direct infringer, for it did not make, sell, or use the patented inventionÄîthe fully assembled deveining machineÄîwithin the United States. The parts of the machine were not themselves patented, we noted, hence export of those parts, unassembled, did not rank as an infringement of Laitram's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1752</span> patent. <i>Id.,</i> at 527-529, 92 S.Ct. 1700.</p>\n<p>Laitram had argued in <i>Deepsouth</i> that resistance to extension of the patent privilege to cover exported parts \"derived from too narrow and technical an interpretation of the [Patent Act].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 529, 92 S.Ct. 1700. Rejecting that argument, we referred to prior decisions holding that \"a combination patent protects only against the operable assembly of the whole and not the manufacture of its parts.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 528, 92 S.Ct. 1700. Congress' codification of patent law, we said, signaled no intention to broaden the scope of the privilege. <i>Id.,</i> at 530, 92 S.Ct. 1700 (\"When, as here, the Constitution is permissive, the sign of how far Congress has chosen to go can come only from Congress.\"). And we again emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote>\"[o]ur patent system makes no claim to extraterritorial effect; these acts of Congress do not, and were not intended to, operate beyond the limits of the United States; and we correspondingly reject the claims of others to such control over our markets.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 531, 92 S.Ct. 1700 (quoting <i>Brown v. Duchesne,</i> 19 How. 183, 195, 15 L.Ed. 595 (1857)).</blockquote>\n<p>Absent \"a clear congressional indication of intent,\" we stated, courts had no warrant to stop the manufacture and sale of the parts of patented inventions for assembly and use abroad. 406 U.S., at 532, 92 S.Ct. 1700.</p>\n<p>Focusing its attention on <i>Deepsouth,</i> Congress enacted ß 271(f). See Patent Law Amendments Act of 1984, ß 101, 98 Stat. 3383; Fisch &amp; Allen, The Application of Domestic Patent Law to Exported Software: 35 U.S.C. ß 271(f), 25 U. Pa. J. Int'l Econ. L. 557, 565 (2004) (\"Congress specifically intended ß 271(f) as a response to the Supreme Court's decision in Deepsouth\").<sup>[3]</sup> The provision expands the definition of infringement to include supplying from the United States a patented invention's components:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention, where such components are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States any component of a patented invention that is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, where such component is uncombined in whole or in part, knowing that such component is so made or adapted and intending that such component will be combined outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.\" 35 U.S.C. ß 271(f).</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Windows is designed, authored, and tested at Microsoft's Redmond, Washington, headquarters. Microsoft sells Windows <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1753</span> to end users and computer manufacturers, both foreign and domestic. Purchasing manufacturers install the software onto the computers they sell. Microsoft sends to each of the foreign manufacturers a master version of Windows, either on a disk or via encrypted electronic transmission. The manufacturer uses the master version to generate copies. Those copies, not the master sent by Microsoft, are installed on the foreign manufacturer's computers. Once assembly is complete, the foreign-made computers are sold to users abroad. App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a-46a.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>AT &amp; T's patent ('580 patent) is for an apparatus (as relevant here, a computer) capable of digitally encoding and compressing recorded speech. Windows, the parties agree, contains software that enables a computer to process speech in the manner claimed by the '580 patent. In 2001, AT &amp; T filed an infringement suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging Microsoft with liability for domestic and foreign installations of Windows.</p>\n<p>Neither Windows software (<i>e.g.,</i> in a box on the shelf) nor a computer standing alone (<i>i.e.,</i> without Windows installed) infringes AT &amp; T's patent. Infringement occurs only when Windows is installed on a computer, thereby rendering it capable of performing as the patented speech processor. Microsoft stipulated that by installing Windows on its own computers during the software development process, it directly infringed the '580 patent.<sup>[5]</sup> Microsoft further acknowledged that by licensing copies of Windows to manufacturers of computers sold in the United States, it induced infringement of AT &amp; T's patent.<sup>[6]</sup><i>Id.,</i> at 42a; Brief for Petitioner 3-4; Brief for Respondent 9, 19.</p>\n<p>Microsoft denied, however, any liability based on the master disks and electronic transmissions it dispatched to foreign manufacturers, thus joining issue with AT &amp; T. By sending Windows to foreign manufacturers, AT &amp; T contended, Microsoft \"supplie[d]... from the United States,\" for \"combination\" abroad, \"components\" of AT &amp; T's patented speech processor; accordingly, AT &amp; T urged, Microsoft was liable under ß 271(f). See <i>supra,</i> at 1752-1753 (reproducing text of ß 271(f)). Microsoft responded that unincorporated software, because it is intangible information, cannot be typed a \"component\" of an invention under ß 271(f). In any event, Microsoft urged, the foreign-generated copies of Windows actually installed abroad were not \"supplie[d] . . . from the United States.\" Rejecting these responses, the District Court held Microsoft liable under ß 271(f). 71 USPQ 2d 1118 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). On appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed. 414 F.3d 1366 (2005). We granted certiorari, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 467, 166 L.Ed.2d 333 (2006), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>This case poses two questions: First, when, or in what form, does software qualify as a \"component\" under ß 271(f)? Second, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1754</span> were \"components\" of the foreign-made computers involved in this case \"supplie[d]\" by Microsoft \"from the United States\"?<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>As to the first question, no one in this litigation argues that software can <i>never</i> rank as a \"component\" under ß 271(f). The parties disagree, however, over the stage at which software becomes a component. Software, the \"set of instructions, known as code, that directs a computer to perform specified functions or operations,\" <i>Fantasy Sports Properties, Inc. v. Sportsline.com, Inc.,</i> 287 F.3d 1108, 1118 (C.A.Fed.2002), can be conceptualized in (at least) two ways. One can speak of software in the abstract: the instructions themselves detached from any medium. (An analogy: The notes of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.) One can alternatively envision a tangible \"copy\" of software, the instructions encoded on a medium such as a CD-ROM. (Sheet music for Beethoven's Ninth.) AT &amp; T argues that software in the abstract, not simply a particular copy of software, qualifies as a \"component\" under ß 271(f). Microsoft and the United States argue that only a copy of software, not software in the abstract, can be a component.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The significance of these diverse views becomes apparent when we turn to the second question: Were components of the foreign-made computers involved in this case \"supplie[d]\" by Microsoft \"from the United States\"? If the relevant components are the copies of Windows actually installed on the foreign computers, AT &amp; T could not persuasively argue that those components, though generated abroad, were \"supplie[d] ... from the United States\" as ß 271(f) requires for liability to attach.<sup>[9]</sup> If, on the other hand, Windows in the abstract qualifies as a component within ß 271(f)'s compass, it would not matter that the master copies of Windows software dispatched from the United States were not themselves installed abroad as working parts of the foreign computers.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>With this explanation of the relationship between the two questions in view, we further consider the twin inquiries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1755</span> B</h2>\n<p>First, when, or in what form, does software become a \"component\" under ß 271(f)? We construe ß 271(f)'s terms \"in accordance with [their] ordinary or natural meaning.\" <i>FDIC v. Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. 471, 476, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). Section 271(f) applies to the supply abroad of the \"components of a patented invention, where <i>such components</i> are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of <i>such components.</i>\" ß 271(f)(1) (emphasis added). The provision thus applies only to \"such components\"<sup>[11]</sup> as are combined to form the \"patented invention\" at issue. The patented invention here is AT &amp; T's speech-processing computer.</p>\n<p>Until it is expressed as a computer-readable \"copy,\" <i>e.g.,</i> on a CD-ROM, Windows softwareÄîindeed any software detached from an activating mediumÄîremains uncombinable. It cannot be inserted into a CD-ROM drive or downloaded from the Internet; it cannot be installed or executed on a computer. Abstract software code is an idea without physical embodiment, and as such, it does not match ß 271(f)'s categorization: \"components\" amenable to \"combination.\" Windows abstracted from a tangible copy no doubt is informationÄîa detailed set of instructionsÄîand thus might be compared to a blueprint (or anything containing design information, <i>e.g.,</i> a schematic, template, or prototype). A blueprint may contain precise instructions for the construction and combination of the components of a patented device, but it is not itself a combinable component of that device. AT &amp; T and its <i>amici</i> do not suggest otherwise. Cf. <i>Pellegrini v. Analog Devices, Inc.,</i> 375 F.3d 1113, 1117-1119 (C.A.Fed.2004) (transmission abroad of instructions for production of patented computer chips not covered by ß 271(f)).</p>\n<p>AT &amp; T urges that software, at least when expressed as machine-readable object code, is distinguishable from design information presented in a blueprint. Software, unlike a blueprint, is \"modular\"; it is a stand-alone product developed and marketed \"for use on many different types of computer hardware and in conjunction with many other types of software.\" Brief for Respondent 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. Software's modularity persists even after installation; it can be updated or removed (deleted) without affecting the hardware on which it is installed. <i>Ibid.</i> Software, unlike a blueprint, is also \"dynamic.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. After a device has been built according to a blueprint's instructions, the blueprint's work is done (as AT &amp; T puts it, the blueprint's instructions have been \"exhausted,\" <i>ibid.</i>). Software's instructions, in contrast, are contained in and continuously performed by a computer. Brief for Respondent 27-28; Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. See also <i>Eolas Technologies Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> 399 F.3d 1325, 1339 (C.A.Fed.2005) (\"[S]oftware code ... drives the functional nucleus of the finished computer product.\" (quoting <i>Imagexpo, L.L.C. v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d 550, 553 (E.D.Va.2003))).</p>\n<p>The distinctions advanced by AT &amp; T do not persuade us to characterize software, uncoupled from a medium, as a combinable component. Blueprints too, or any design information for that matter, can be independently developed, bought, and sold. If the point of AT &amp; T's argument is that we do not see blueprints lining stores' shelves, the same observation may be made about software in the abstract: What retailers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1756</span> sell, and consumers buy, are <i>copies</i> of software. Likewise, before software can be contained in and continuously performed by a computer, before it can be updated or deleted, an actual, physical copy of the software must be delivered by CD-ROM or some other means capable of interfacing with the computer.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Because it is so easy to encode software's instructions onto a medium that can be read by a computer, AT &amp; T intimates, that extra step should not play a decisive role under ß 271(f). But the extra step is what renders the software a usable, combinable part of a computer; easy or not, the copy-producing step is essential. Moreover, many tools may be used easily and inexpensively to generate the parts of a device. A machine for making sprockets might be used by a manufacturer to produce tens of thousands of sprockets an hour. That does not make the machine a \"component\" of the tens of thousands of devices in which the sprockets are incorporated, at least not under any ordinary understanding of the term \"component.\" Congress, of course, might have included within ß 271(f)'s compass, for example, not only combinable \"components\" of a patented invention, but also \"information, instructions, or tools from which those components readily may be generated.\" It did not. In sum, a copy of Windows, not Windows in the abstract, qualifies as a \"component\" under ß 271(f).<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The next question, has Microsoft \"supplie[d] ... from the United States\" components of the computers here involved? Under a conventional reading of ß 271(f)'s text, the answer would be \"No,\" for the foreign-made copies of Windows actually installed on the computers were \"supplie[d]\" from places outside the United States. The Federal Circuit majority concluded, however, that \"for software `components,' the act of copying is subsumed in the act of `supplying.'\" 414 F.3d, at 1370. A master sent abroad, the majority observed, differs not at all from the exact copies, easily, inexpensively, and swiftly generated from the master; hence \"sending a single copy abroad with the intent that it be replicated invokes ß 271(f) liability for th[e] foreign-made copies.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> cf. <i>post,</i> at 1762-1763 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"[A] master disk is the functional equivalent of a warehouse of components ... that Microsoft fully expects to be incorporated into foreign-manufactured computers.\").</p>\n<p>Judge Rader, dissenting, noted that \"supplying\" is ordinarily understood to mean an activity separate and distinct from any subsequent \"copying, replicating, or reproducingÄîin effect manufacturing.\" 414 F.3d, at 1372-1373 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>id.,</i> at 1373 (\"[C]opying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1757</span> and supplying are separate acts with different consequencesÄîparticularly when the `supplying' occurs in the United States and the copying occurs in D¸sseldorf or Tokyo. As a matter of logic, one cannot supply one hundred components of a patented invention without first making one hundred copies of the component ....\"). He further observed: \"The only true difference between making and supplying software components and physical components [of other patented inventions] is that copies of software components are easier to make and transport.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1374. But nothing in ß 271(f)'s text, Judge Rader maintained, renders ease of copying a relevant, no less decisive, factor in triggering liability for infringement. See <i>ibid.</i> We agree.</p>\n<p>Section 271(f) prohibits the supply of components \"from the United States ... in such manner as to actively induce the combination of <i>such components.</i>\" ß 271(f)(1) (emphasis added). Under this formulation, the very components supplied from the United States, and not copies thereof, trigger ß 271(f) liability when combined abroad to form the patented invention at issue. Here, as we have repeatedly noted, see <i>supra,</i> at 1750-1751, 1752-1753, the copies of Windows actually installed on the foreign computers were not themselves supplied from the United States.<sup>[14]</sup> Indeed, those copies did not exist until they were generated by third parties outside the United States.<sup>[15]</sup> Copying software abroad, all might agree, is indeed easy and inexpensive. But the same could be said of other items: \"Keys or machine parts might be copied from a master; chemical or biological substances might be created by reproduction; and paper products might be made by electronic copying and printing.\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 24. See also <i>supra,</i> at 1755-1756 (rejecting argument similarly based on ease of copying in construing \"component\"). Section 271(f) contains no instruction to gauge when duplication is easy and cheap enough to deem a copy in fact made abroad nevertheless \"supplie[d] ... from the United States.\" The absence of anything addressing copying in the statutory text weighs against a judicial determination that replication abroad of a master dispatched from the United States \"supplies\" the foreign-made copies from the United States within the intendment of ß 271(f).<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1758</span> D</h2>\n<p>Any doubt that Microsoft's conduct falls outside ß 271(f)'s compass would be resolved by the presumption against extraterritoriality, on which we have already touched. See <i>supra,</i> at 1750-1751, 1752. The presumption that United States law governs domestically but does not rule the world applies with particular force in patent law. The traditional understanding that our patent law \"operate[s] only domestically and d[oes] not extend to foreign activities,\" Fisch &amp; Allen, <i>supra,</i> at 559, is embedded in the Patent Act itself, which provides that a patent confers exclusive rights in an invention within the United States. 35 U.S.C. ß 154(a)(1) (patentee's rights over invention apply to manufacture, use, or sale \"throughout the United States\" and to importation \"into the United States\"). See <i>Deepsouth,</i> 406 U.S., at 531, 92 S.Ct. 1700 (\"Our patent system makes no claim to extraterritorial effect\"; our legislation \"d[oes] not, and [was] not intended to, operate beyond the limits of the United States, and we correspondingly reject the claims of others to such control over our markets.\" (quoting <i>Brown,</i> 19 How., at 195, 15 L.Ed. 595)).</p>\n<p>As a principle of general application, moreover, we have stated that courts should \"assume that legislators take account of the legitimate sovereign interests of other nations when they write American laws.\" <i>F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S. A.,</i> 542 U.S. 155, 164, 124 S.Ct. 2359, 159 L.Ed.2d 226 (2004); see <i>EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,</i> 499 U.S. 244, 248, 111 S.Ct. 1227, 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991). Thus, the United States accurately conveyed in this case: \"Foreign conduct is [generally] the domain of foreign law,\" and in the area here involved, in particular, foreign law \"may embody different policy judgments about the relative rights of inventors, competitors, and the public in patented inventions.\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 28. Applied to this case, the presumption tugs strongly against construction of ß 271(f) to encompass as a \"component\" not only a physical copy of software, but also software's intangible code, and to render \"supplie[d]... from the United States\" not only exported copies of software, but also duplicates made abroad.</p>\n<p>AT &amp; T argues that the presumption is inapplicable because Congress enacted ß 271(f) specifically to extend the reach of United States patent law to cover certain activity abroad. But as this Court has explained, \"the presumption is not defeated... just because [a statute] specifically addresses [an] issue of extraterritorial application,\" <i>Smith v. United States,</i> 507 U.S. 197, 204, 113 S.Ct. 1178, 122 L.Ed.2d 548 (1993); it remains instructive in determining the <i>extent</i> of the statutory exception. See <i>Empagran,</i> 542 U.S., at 161-162, 164-165, 124 S.Ct. 2359; <i>Smith,</i> 507 U.S., at 204, 113 S.Ct. 1178.</p>\n<p>AT &amp; T alternately contends that the presumption holds no sway here given that ß 271(f), by its terms, applies only to domestic conduct, <i>i.e.,</i> to the supply of a patented invention's components \"from the United States.\" ß 271(f)(1). AT &amp; T's reading, however, \"converts a single act of supply from the United States into a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1759</span> springboard for liability each time a copy of the software is subsequently made [abroad] and combined with computer hardware [abroad] for sale [abroad.]\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 29; see 414 F.3d, at 1373, 1375 (Rader, J., dissenting). In short, foreign law alone, not United States law, currently governs the manufacture and sale of components of patented inventions in foreign countries. If AT &amp; T desires to prevent copying in foreign countries, its remedy today lies in obtaining and enforcing foreign patents. See <i>Deepsouth,</i> 406 U.S., at 531, 92 S.Ct. 1700.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>AT &amp; T urges that reading ß 271(f) to cover only those copies of software actually dispatched from the United States creates a \"loophole\" for software makers. Liability for infringing a United States patent could be avoided, as Microsoft's practice shows, by an easily arranged circumvention: Instead of making installation copies of software in the United States, the copies can be made abroad, swiftly and at small cost, by generating them from a master supplied from the United States. The Federal Circuit majority found AT &amp; T's plea compelling:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Were we to hold that Microsoft's supply by exportation of the master versions of the Windows &amp; reg; softwareÄî specifically for the purpose of foreign replicationÄîavoids infringement, we would be subverting the remedial nature of ß 271(f), permitting a technical avoidance of the statute by ignoring the advances in a field of technologyÄîand its associated industry practicesÄîthat developed after the enactment of ß 271(f).... Section ß 271(f), if it is to remain effective, must therefore be interpreted in a manner that is appropriate to the nature of the technology at issue.\" 414 F.3d, at 1371.</blockquote>\n<p>While the majority's concern is understandable, we are not persuaded that dynamic judicial interpretation of ß 271(f) is in order. The \"loophole,\" in our judgment, is properly left for Congress to consider, and to close if it finds such action warranted.</p>\n<p>There is no dispute, we note again, that ß 271(f) is inapplicable to the export of design toolsÄîblueprints, schematics, templates, and prototypesÄîall of which may provide the information required to construct and combine overseas the components of inventions patented under United States law. See <i>supra,</i> at 1755-1756. We have no license to attribute to Congress an unstated intention to place the information Microsoft dispatched from the United States in a separate category.</p>\n<p>Section 271(f) was a direct response to a gap in our patent law revealed by this Court's <i>Deepsouth</i> decision. See <i>supra,</i> at 1752, and n. 3. The facts of that case were undeniably at the fore when ß 271(f) was in the congressional hopper. In <i>Deepsouth,</i> the items exported were kits containing all the physical, readily assemblable parts of a shrimp deveining machine (not an intangible set of instructions), and those parts themselves (not foreign-made copies of them) would be combined abroad by foreign buyers. Having attended to the gap made evident in <i>Deepsouth,</i> Congress did not address other arguable gaps: Section 271(f) does not identify as an infringing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1760</span> act conduct in the United States that facilitates making a component of a patented invention outside the United States; nor does the provision check \"suppl[ying]... from the United States\" information, instructions, or other materials needed to make copies abroad.<sup>[18]</sup> Given that Congress did not home in on the loophole AT &amp; T describes, and in view of the expanded extraterritorial thrust AT &amp; T's reading of ß 271(f) entails, our precedent leads us to leave in Congress' court the patent-protective determination AT &amp; T seeks. Cf. <i>Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,</i> 464 U.S. 417, 431, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) (\"In a case like this, in which Congress has not plainly marked our course, we must be circumspect in construing the scope of rights created by a legislative enactment which never contemplated such a calculus of interests.\").</p>\n<p>Congress is doubtless aware of the ease with which software (and other electronic media) can be copied, and has not left the matter untouched. In 1998, Congress addressed \"the ease with which pirates could copy and distribute a copyrightable work in digital form.\" <i>Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Corley,</i> 273 F.3d 429, 435 (C.A.2 2001). The resulting measure, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. ß 1201 <i>et seq.,</i> \"backed with legal sanctions the efforts of copyright owners to protect their works from piracy behind digital walls such as encryption codes or password protections.\" <i>Universal City Studios,</i> 273 F.3d, at 435. If the patent law is to be adjusted better \"to account for the realities of software distribution,\" 414 F.3d, at 1370, the alteration should be made after focused legislative consideration, and not by the Judiciary forecasting Congress' likely disposition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, with whom Justice THOMAS and Justice BREYER join, concurring as to all but footnote 14.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that no \"component[s]\" of the foreign-made computers involved in this case were \"supplie[d]\" by Microsoft \"from the United States.\" 35 U.S.C. ß 271(f)(1). I write separately because I reach this conclusion through somewhat different reasoning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Computer programmers typically write programs in a \"human readable\" programming language. This \"`source code'\" is then generally converted by the computer into a \"machine readable code\" or \"machine language\" expressed in a binary format. Brief for Respondent 5, n. 1 (citing R. White, How Computers Work 87, 94 (8th ed.2006)); E. Walters, Essential Guide to Computing 204-205 (2001). During the Windows writing process, the program exists in the form of machine readable code on the magnetic tape fields of Microsoft's computers' hard drives. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1761</span> White, <i>supra,</i> at 144-145; Walters, <i>supra,</i> at 54-55.</p>\n<p>When Microsoft finishes writing its Windows program in the United States, it encodes Windows onto CD-ROMs known as \"`golden masters'\" in the form of machine readable code. App. 31, ∂ 4. This is done by engraving each disk in a specific way such that another computer can read the engravings, understand what they mean, and write the code onto the magnetic fields of its hard drive. <i>Ibid.;</i> Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 2.</p>\n<p>Microsoft ships these disks (or sends the code via electronic transmission) abroad, where the code is copied onto other disks that are then placed into foreign-made computers for purposes of installing the Windows program. App. 31-32, ∂∂ 5-8. No physical aspect of a Windows CD-ROMÄîoriginal disk or copyÄîis ever incorporated into the computer itself. See <i>Stenograph L.L.C. v. Bossard Assocs., Inc.,</i> 144 F.3d 96, 100 (C.A.D.C.1998) (noting that, within the context of the Copyright Act, \"installation of software onto a computer results in `copying'\"); White, <i>supra,</i> at 144-145, 172-173. The intact CD-ROM is then removed and may be discarded without affecting the computer's implementation of the code.<sup>[*]</sup> The parties agree for purposes of this litigation that a foreign-made computer containing the Windows code would violate AT &amp; T's patent if present in the United States. Pet. for Cert. 42a, ∂ 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>I agree with the Court that a component of a machine, whether a shrimp deveiner or a personal computer, must be something physical. <i>Ante,</i> at 1754-1756. This is because the word \"component,\" when concerning a physical device, is most naturally read to mean a physical part of the device. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 466 (1976) (component is a \"constituent part: INGREDIENT\"); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 301 (1967) (component is a \"a component part; constituent\"). Furthermore, ß 271(f) requires that the component be \"combined\" with other components to form the infringing device, meaning that the component must remain a part of any. Webster's, <i>supra,</i> at 452 (combine means \"to join in physical or chemical union\"; \"to become one\"; \"to unite into a chemical compound\"); Random House, <i>supra,</i> at 293 (combine means \"to bring or join into a close union or whole\"). For these reasons, I agree with the Court that a set of instructions on how to build an infringing device, or even a template of the device, does not qualify as a component. <i>Ante,</i> at 1754-1755.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>As the parties agree, an inventor can patent a machine that carries out a certain process, and a computer may constitute such a machine when it executes commandsÄîgiven to it by codeÄîthat allow it to carry out that process. Such a computer would not become an infringing device until enough of the code is installed on the computer to allow it to execute the process in question. The computer would not be an infringing device prior to the installation, or even during the installation. And the computer remains an infringing device after the installation process because, even though the original installation device (such as a CD-ROM) has been removed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1762</span> from the computer, the code remains on the hard drive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Here, Windows software originating in the United States was sent abroad, whether on a master disk or by means of an electronic transmission, and eventually copied onto the hard drives of the foreign-made computers. Once the copying process was completed, the Windows program was recorded in a physical form, <i>i.e.,</i> in magnetic fields on the computers' hard drives. See Brief for Respondent 5. The physical form of the Windows program on the master disk, <i>i.e.,</i> the engravings on the CD-ROM, remained on the disk in a form unchanged by the copying process. See Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 2 (citing White, How Computers Work, at 144-145, 172-173). There is nothing in the record to suggest that any physical part of the disk became a physical part of the foreign-made computer, and such an occurrence would be contrary to the general workings of computers.</p>\n<p>Because no physical object originating in the United States was combined with these computers, there was no violation of ß 271(f). Accordingly, it is irrelevant that the Windows software was not copied onto the foreign-made computers <i>directly</i> from the master disk or from an electronic transmission that originated in the United States. To be sure, if these computers could not run Windows without inserting and keeping a CD-ROM in the appropriate drive, then the CD-ROMs might be components of the computer. But that is not the case here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Because the physical incarnation of code on the Windows CD-ROM supplied from the United States is not a \"component\" of an infringing device under ß 271(f), it logically follows that a copy of such a CD-ROM also is not a component. For this reason, I join the Court's opinion, except for footnote 14.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>As the Court acknowledges, \"[p]lausible arguments can be made for and against extending ß 271(f) to the conduct charged in this case as infringing AT &amp; T's patent.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1751. Strong policy considerations, buttressed by the presumption against the application of domestic patent law in foreign markets, support Microsoft Corporation's position. I am, however, persuaded that an affirmance of the Court of Appeals' judgment is more faithful to the intent of the Congress that enacted ß 271(f) than a reversal.</p>\n<p>The provision was a response to our decision in <i>Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp.,</i> 406 U.S. 518, 92 S.Ct. 1700, 32 L.Ed.2d 273 (1972), holding that a patent on a shrimp deveining machine had not been infringed by the export of components for assembly abroad. Paragraph (1) of ß 271(f) would have been sufficient on its own to overrule <i>Deepsouth,</i><sup>[*]</sup> but it is paragraph (2) that best supports AT &amp; T's position here. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States any component of a patented invention that is especially made <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1763</span> or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, where such component is uncombined in whole or in part, knowing that such component is so made or adapted and intending that such component will be combined outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.\" ß 271(f)(2).</blockquote>\n<p>Under this provision, the export of a specially designed knife that has no use other than as a part of a patented deveining machine would constitute infringement. It follows that ß 271(f)(2) would cover the export of an inventory of such knives to be warehoused until used to complete the assembly of an infringing machine.</p>\n<p>The relevant component in this case is not a physical item like a knife. Both Microsoft and the Court think that means it cannot be a \"component.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 1755. But if a disk with software inscribed on it is a \"component,\" I find it difficult to understand why the most important ingredient of that component is not also a component. Indeed, the master disk is the functional equivalent of a warehouse of componentsÄîcomponents that Microsoft fully expects to be incorporated into foreign-manufactured computers. Put somewhat differently: On the Court's view, Microsoft could be liable under ß 271(f) only if it sends individual copies of its software directly from the United States with the intent that each copy would be incorporated into a separate infringing computer. But it seems to me that an indirect transmission via a master disk warehouse is likewise covered by ß 271(f).</p>\n<p>I disagree with the Court's suggestion that because software is analogous to an abstract set of instructions, it cannot be regarded as a \"component\" within the meaning of ß 271(f). See <i>ante,</i> at 1754-1755. Whether attached or detached from any medium, software plainly satisfies the dictionary definition of that word. See <i>ante,</i> at 1755, n. 11 (observing that \"`[c]omponent' is commonly defined as `a constituent part,' `element,' or `ingredient' \"). And unlike a blueprint that merely instructs a user how to do something, software actually causes infringing conduct to occur. It is more like a roller that causes a player piano to produce sound than sheet music that tells a pianist what to do. Moreover, it is surely not \"a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use\" as that term is used in ß 271(f)(2). On the contrary, its sole intended use is an infringing use.</p>\n<p>I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Deepsouth shipped its deveining equipment \"to foreign customers in three separate boxes, each containing only parts of the 1æton machines, yet the whole [was] assemblable in less than one hour.\" <i>Deepsouth Packing Co. v.

While there are differences between ß 271(f)(1) and (f)(2), see, <i>e.g., infra,</i> at 1760, n. 18, the parties do not suggest that those differences are outcome determinative. Cf. <i>infra,</i> at 1757-1758, n. 16 (explaining why both paragraphs yield the same result). For clarity's sake, we focus our analysis on the text of ß 271(f)(1).</p>\n<p>[8]  Microsoft and the United States stress that to count as a component, the copy of software must be expressed as \"object code.\" \"Software in the form in which it is written and understood by humans is called `source code.' To be functional, however, software must be converted (or `compiled') into its machine-usable version,\" a sequence of binary number instructions typed \"object code.\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 4, n. 1; 71 USPQ 2d 1118, 1119, n. 5, 2004 WL 406640 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (recounting Microsoft's description of the software development process). It is stipulated that object code was on the master disks and electronic transmissions Microsoft dispatched from the United States.</p>\n<p>[9]  On this view of \"component,\" the copies of Windows on the master disks and electronic transmissions that Microsoft sent from the United States could not themselves serve as a basis for liability, because those copies were not installed on the foreign manufacturers' computers. See ß 271(f)(1) (encompassing only those components \"combin[ed] ... outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States\").</p>\n<p>[10]  The Federal Circuit panel in this case, relying on that court's prior decision in <i>Eolas Technologies Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> 399 F.3d 1325 (2005), held that software qualifies as a component under ß 271(f). We are unable to determine, however, whether the Federal Circuit panels regarded as a component software in the abstract, or a copy of software.</p>\n<p>[11]  \"Component\" is commonly defined as \"a constituent part,\" \"element,\" or \"ingredient.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 466 (1981).</p>\n<p>[12]  The dissent, embracing AT &amp; T's argument, contends that, \"unlike a blueprint that merely instructs a user how to do something, software actually causes infringing conduct to occur.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1763 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). We have emphasized, however, that Windows can \"caus[e] infringing conduct to occur\"Äî<i>i.e.,</i> function as part of AT &amp; T's speech-processing computerÄîonly when expressed as a computer-readable copy. Abstracted from a usable copy, Windows code is intangible, uncombinable information, more like notes of music in the head of a composer than \"a roller that causes a player piano to produce sound.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>[13]  We need not address whether software in the abstract, or any other intangible, can <i>ever</i> be a component under ß 271(f). If an intangible method or process, for instance, qualifies as a \"patented invention\" under ß 271(f) (a question as to which we express no opinion), the combinable components of that invention might be intangible as well. The invention before us, however, AT &amp; T's speech-processing computer, is a tangible thing.</p>\n<p>[14]  In a footnote, Microsoft suggests that even a disk shipped from the United States, and used to install Windows directly on a foreign computer, would not give rise to liability under ß 271(f) if the disk were removed after installation. See Brief for Petitioner 37, n. 11; cf. <i>post,</i> at 1761-1762 (ALITO, J., concurring). We need not and do not reach that issue here.</p>\n<p>[15]  The dissent analogizes Microsoft's supply of master versions of Windows abroad to \"the export of an inventory of ... knives to be warehoused until used to complete the assembly of an infringing machine.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1761. But as we have underscored, foreign-made copies of Windows, not the masters Microsoft dispatched from the United States, were installed on the computers here involved. A more apt analogy, therefore, would be the export of knives for <i>copying</i> abroad, with the foreign-made <i>copies</i> \"warehoused until used to complete the assembly of an infringing machine.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Without stretching ß 271(f) beyond the text Congress composed, a copy made entirely abroad does not fit the description \"supplie[d] ... from the United States.\"</p>\n<p>[16]  Our analysis, while focusing on ß 271(f)(1), is equally applicable to ß 271(f)(2). But cf. <i>post,</i> at 1762 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (asserting \"paragraph (2) ... best supports AT &amp; T's position here\"). While the two paragraphs differ, among other things, on the quantity of components that must be \"supplie[d]... from the United States\" for liability to attach, see <i>infra,</i> at 1760, n. 18, that distinction does not affect our analysis. Paragraph (2), like (1), covers only a \"component\" amenable to \"combination.\" ß 271(f)(2); see <i>supra,</i> at 1754-1756 (explaining why Windows in the abstract is not a combinable component). Paragraph (2), like (1), encompasses only the \"[s]uppl[y] ... from the United States\" of \"such [a] component\" as will itself \"be combined outside of the United States.\" ß 271(f)(2); see <i>supra,</i> at 1756-1757 and this page (observing that foreign-made copies of Windows installed on computers abroad were not \"supplie[d] ... from the United States\"). It is thus unsurprising that AT &amp; T does not join the dissent in suggesting that the outcome might turn on whether we view the case under paragraph (1) or (2).</p>\n<p>[17]  AT &amp; T has secured patents for its speech processor in Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, and Sweden. App. in No. 04-1285 (CA Fed.), p. 1477. AT &amp; T and its <i>amici</i> do not relate what protections and remedies are, or are not, available under these foreign regimes. Cf. Brief for Respondent 46 (observing that \"foreign patent protections are <i>sometimes</i> weaker than their U.S. counterparts\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>[18]  Section 271(f)'s text does, in one respect, reach past the facts of <i>Deepsouth.</i> While Deepsouth exported kits containing <i>all</i> the parts of its deveining machines, ß 271(f)(1) applies to the supply abroad of \"all or a substantial portion of\" a patented invention's components. And ß 271(f)(2) applies to the export of even a single component if it is \"especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use.\"</p>\n<p>[*]  In a sense, the whole process is akin to an author living prior to the existence of the printing press, who created a story in his mind, wrote a manuscript, and sent it to a scrivener, who in turn copied the story by hand into a blank book.</p>\n<p>[*]  \"Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention, where such components are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.\" 35 U.S.C. ß 271(f)(1).</p>\n\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b>127 S.Ct. 1746 (2007)</b></center>\n<center><h1>MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Petitioner,<br>\nv.<br>\nAT &amp; T CORP.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 05-1056.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued February 21, 2007.</center>\n<center>Decided April 30, 2007.</center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1750</span> Theodore B.

There is an exception. Section 271(f) of the Patent Act, adopted in 1984, provides that infringement does occur when one \"supplies... from the United States,\" for \"combination\" abroad, a patented invention's \"components.\" 35 U.S.C. ß 271(f)(1). This case concerns the applicability of ß 271(f) to computer software first sent from the United States to a foreign manufacturer on a master disk, or by electronic transmission, then copied by the foreign recipient for installation on computers made and sold abroad.</p>\n<p>AT &amp; T holds a patent on an apparatus for digitally encoding and compressing recorded speech. Microsoft's Windows operating system, it is conceded, has the potential to infringe AT &amp; T's patent, because Windows incorporates software code that, when installed, enables a computer to process speech in the manner claimed by that patent. It bears emphasis, however, that uninstalled Windows software does not infringe AT &amp; T's patent any more than a computer standing alone does; instead, the patent is infringed only when a computer is loaded with Windows and is thereby rendered capable of performing as the patented speech processor. The question before us: Does Microsoft's liability extend to computers made in another country when loaded with Windows software copied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1751</span> abroad from a master disk or electronic transmission dispatched by Microsoft from the United States? Our answer is \"No.\"</p>\n<p>The master disk or electronic transmission Microsoft sends from the United States is never installed on any of the foreign-made computers in question. Instead, copies made abroad are used for installation. Because Microsoft does not export from the United States the copies actually installed, it does not \"suppl[y] ... from the United States\" \"components\" of the relevant computers, and therefore is not liable under ß 271(f) as currently written.</p>\n<p>Plausible arguments can be made for and against extending ß 271(f) to the conduct charged in this case as infringing AT &amp; T's patent. Recognizing that ß 271(f) is an exception to the general rule that our patent law does not apply extraterritorially, we resist giving the language in which Congress cast ß 271(f) an expansive interpretation. Our decision leaves to Congress' informed judgment any adjustment of ß 271(f) it deems necessary or proper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Our decision some 35 years ago in <i>Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108547\"><a href=\"/opinion/108547/deepsouth-packing-co-v-laitram-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 92 S.Ct. 1700, 32 L.Ed.2d 273 (1972), a case about a shrimp deveining machine, led Congress to enact ß 271(f). In that case, Laitram, holder of a patent on the time-and-expense-saving machine, sued Deepsouth, manufacturer of an infringing deveiner. Deepsouth conceded that the Patent Act barred it from making and selling its deveining machine in the United States, but sought to salvage a portion of its business: Nothing in United States patent law, Deepsouth urged, stopped it from making in the United States the <i>parts</i> of its deveiner, as opposed to the machine itself, and selling those <i>parts</i> to foreign buyers for assembly and use abroad. <i>Id.,</i> at 522-524, 92 S.Ct. 1700.<sup>[1]</sup> We agreed.</p>\n<p>Interpreting our patent law as then written, we reiterated in <i>Deepsouth</i> that it was \"not an infringement to make or use a patented product outside of the United States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 527, 92 S.Ct. 1700; see 35 U.S.C. ß 271(a) (1970 ed.) (\"[W]hoever without authority makes, uses or sells any patented invention, within the United States during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent.\").

Microsoft sells Windows <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1753</span> to end users and computer manufacturers, both foreign and domestic. Purchasing manufacturers install the software onto the computers they sell. Microsoft sends to each of the foreign manufacturers a master version of Windows, either on a disk or via encrypted electronic transmission. The manufacturer uses the master version to generate copies. Those copies, not the master sent by Microsoft, are installed on the foreign manufacturer's computers. Once assembly is complete, the foreign-made computers are sold to users abroad.

Windows, the parties agree, contains software that enables a computer to process speech in the manner claimed by the '580 patent. In 2001, AT &amp; T filed an infringement suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging Microsoft with liability for domestic and foreign installations of Windows.</p>\n<p>Neither Windows software (<i>e.g.,</i> in a box on the shelf) nor a computer standing alone (<i>i.e.,</i> without Windows installed) infringes AT &amp; T's patent. Infringement occurs only when Windows is installed on a computer, thereby rendering it capable of performing as the patented speech processor. Microsoft stipulated that by installing Windows on its own computers during the software development process, it directly infringed the '580 patent.<sup>[5]</sup> Microsoft further acknowledged that by licensing copies of Windows to manufacturers of computers sold in the United States, it induced infringement of AT &amp; T's patent.<sup>[6]</sup><i>Id.,</i> at 42a; Brief for Petitioner 3-4; Brief for Respondent 9, 19.</p>\n<p>Microsoft denied, however, any liability based on the master disks and electronic transmissions it dispatched to foreign manufacturers, thus joining issue with AT &amp; T. By sending Windows to foreign manufacturers, AT &amp; T contended, Microsoft \"supplie[d]... from the United States,\" for \"combination\" abroad, \"components\" of AT &amp; T's patented speech processor; accordingly, AT &amp; T urged, Microsoft was liable under ß 271(f). See <i>supra,</i> at 1752-1753 (reproducing text of ß 271(f)). Microsoft responded that unincorporated software, because it is intangible information, cannot be typed a \"component\" of an invention under ß 271(f). In any event, Microsoft urged, the foreign-generated copies of Windows actually installed abroad were not \"supplie[d] . . . from the United States.\" Rejecting these responses, the District Court held Microsoft liable under ß 271(f). 71 USPQ 2d 1118 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). On appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791021\"><a href=\"/opinion/791021/at-t-corp-v-microsoft-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1366</span></a></span> (2005).

Second, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1754</span> were \"components\" of the foreign-made computers involved in this case \"supplie[d]\" by Microsoft \"from the United States\"?<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>As to the first question, no one in this litigation argues that software can <i>never</i> rank as a \"component\" under ß 271(f). The parties disagree, however, over the stage at which software becomes a component. Software, the \"set of instructions, known as code, that directs a computer to perform specified functions or operations,\" <i>Fantasy Sports Properties, Inc. v. Sportsline.com, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777408\"><a href=\"/opinion/777408/fantasy-sports-properties-inc-v-sportslinecom-inc-/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></a></span>, 1118 (C.A.Fed.2002), can be conceptualized in (at least) two ways. One can speak of software in the abstract: the instructions themselves detached from any medium. (An analogy: The notes of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.) One can alternatively envision a tangible \"copy\" of software, the instructions encoded on a medium such as a CD-ROM. (Sheet music for Beethoven's Ninth.) AT &amp; T argues that software in the abstract, not simply a particular copy of software, qualifies as a \"component\" under ß 271(f). Microsoft and the United States argue that only a copy of software, not software in the abstract, can be a component.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The significance of these diverse views becomes apparent when we turn to the second question: Were components of the foreign-made computers involved in this case \"supplie[d]\" by Microsoft \"from the United States\"? If the relevant components are the copies of Windows actually installed on the foreign computers, AT &amp; T could not persuasively argue that those components, though generated abroad, were \"supplie[d] ... from the United States\" as ß 271(f) requires for liability to attach.<sup>[9]</sup> If, on the other hand, Windows in the abstract qualifies as a component within ß 271(f)'s compass, it would not matter that the master copies of Windows software dispatched from the United States were not themselves installed abroad as working parts of the foreign computers.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>With this explanation of the relationship between the two questions in view, we further consider the twin inquiries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1755</span> B</h2>\n<p>First, when, or in what form, does software become a \"component\" under ß 271(f)? We construe ß 271(f)'s terms \"in accordance with [their] ordinary or natural meaning.\" <i>FDIC v. Meyer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 476, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). Section 271(f) applies to the supply abroad of the \"components of a patented invention, where <i>such components</i> are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of <i>such components.</i>\" ß 271(f)(1) (emphasis added). The provision thus applies only to \"such components\"<sup>[11]</sup> as are combined to form the \"patented invention\" at issue. The patented invention here is AT &amp; T's speech-processing computer.</p>\n<p>Until it is expressed as a computer-readable \"copy,\" <i>e.g.,</i> on a CD-ROM, Windows softwareÄîindeed any software detached from an activating mediumÄîremains uncombinable. It cannot be inserted into a CD-ROM drive or downloaded from the Internet; it cannot be installed or executed on a computer. Abstract software code is an idea without physical embodiment, and as such, it does not match ß 271(f)'s categorization: \"components\" amenable to \"combination.\" Windows abstracted from a tangible copy no doubt is informationÄîa detailed set of instructionsÄîand thus might be compared to a blueprint (or anything containing design information, <i>e.g.,</i> a schematic, template, or prototype). A blueprint may contain precise instructions for the construction and combination of the components of a patented device, but it is not itself a combinable component of that device. AT &amp; T and its <i>amici</i> do not suggest otherwise. Cf. <i>Pellegrini v. Analog Devices, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786972\"><a href=\"/opinion/786972/gerald-n-pellegrini-v-analog-devices-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span>, 1117-1119 (C.A.Fed.2004) (transmission abroad of instructions for production of patented computer chips not covered by ß 271(f)).</p>\n<p>AT &amp; T urges that software, at least when expressed as machine-readable object code, is distinguishable from design information presented in a blueprint. Software, unlike a blueprint, is \"modular\"; it is a stand-alone product developed and marketed \"for use on many different types of computer hardware and in conjunction with many other types of software.\" Brief for Respondent 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. Software's modularity persists even after installation; it can be updated or removed (deleted) without affecting the hardware on which it is installed. <i>Ibid.</i> Software, unlike a blueprint, is also \"dynamic.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. After a device has been built according to a blueprint's instructions, the blueprint's work is done (as AT &amp; T puts it, the blueprint's instructions have been \"exhausted,\" <i>ibid.</i>). Software's instructions, in contrast, are contained in and continuously performed by a computer. Brief for Respondent 27-28; Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. See also <i>Eolas Technologies Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"212043\"><a href=\"/opinion/212043/eolas-technologies-v-microsoft/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span>, 1339 (C.A.Fed.2005) (\"[S]oftware code ... drives the functional nucleus of the finished computer product.\" (quoting <i>Imagexpo, L.L.C. v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d 550, 553 (E.D.Va.2003))).</p>\n<p>The distinctions advanced by AT &amp; T do not persuade us to characterize software, uncoupled from a medium, as a combinable component. Blueprints too, or any design information for that matter, can be independently developed, bought, and sold. If the point of AT &amp; T's argument is that we do not see blueprints lining stores' shelves, the same observation may be made about software in the abstract: What retailers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1756</span> sell, and consumers buy, are <i>copies</i> of software. Likewise, before software can be contained in and continuously performed by a computer, before it can be updated or deleted, an actual, physical copy of the software must be delivered by CD-ROM or some other means capable of interfacing with the computer.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Because it is so easy to encode software's instructions onto a medium that can be read by a computer, AT &amp; T intimates, that extra step should not play a decisive role under ß 271(f). But the extra step is what renders the software a usable, combinable part of a computer; easy or not, the copy-producing step is essential. Moreover, many tools may be used easily and inexpensively to generate the parts of a device. A machine for making sprockets might be used by a manufacturer to produce tens of thousands of sprockets an hour. That does not make the machine a \"component\" of the tens of thousands of devices in which the sprockets are incorporated, at least not under any ordinary understanding of the term \"component.\" Congress, of course, might have included within ß 271(f)'s compass, for example, not only combinable \"components\" of a patented invention, but also \"information, instructions, or tools from which those components readily may be generated.\" It did not. In sum, a copy of Windows, not Windows in the abstract, qualifies as a \"component\" under ß 271(f).<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The next question, has Microsoft \"supplie[d] ... from the United States\" components of the computers here involved? Under a conventional reading of ß 271(f)'s text, the answer would be \"No,\" for the foreign-made copies of Windows actually installed on the computers were \"supplie[d]\" from places outside the United States. The Federal Circuit majority concluded, however, that \"for software `components,' the act of copying is subsumed in the act of `supplying.'\" 414 F.3d, at 1370. A master sent abroad, the majority observed, differs not at all from the exact copies, easily, inexpensively, and swiftly generated from the master; hence \"sending a single copy abroad with the intent that it be replicated invokes ß 271(f) liability for th[e] foreign-made copies.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> cf. <i>post,</i> at 1762-1763 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"[A] master disk is the functional equivalent of a warehouse of components ... that Microsoft fully expects to be incorporated into foreign-manufactured computers.\").</p>\n<p>Judge Rader, dissenting, noted that \"supplying\" is ordinarily understood to mean an activity separate and distinct from any subsequent \"copying, replicating, or reproducingÄîin effect manufacturing.\" 414 F.3d, at 1372-1373 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>id.,</i> at 1373 (\"[C]opying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1757</span> and supplying are separate acts with different consequencesÄîparticularly when the `supplying' occurs in the United States and the copying occurs in D¸sseldorf or Tokyo. As a matter of logic, one cannot supply one hundred components of a patented invention without first making one hundred copies of the component ....\"). He further observed: \"The only true difference between making and supplying software components and physical components [of other patented inventions] is that copies of software components are easier to make and transport.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1374. But nothing in ß 271(f)'s text, Judge Rader maintained, renders ease of copying a relevant, no less decisive, factor in triggering liability for infringement. See <i>ibid.</i> We agree.</p>\n<p>Section 271(f) prohibits the supply of components \"from the United States ... in such manner as to actively induce the combination of <i>such components.</i>\" ß 271(f)(1) (emphasis added). Under this formulation, the very components supplied from the United States, and not copies thereof, trigger ß 271(f) liability when combined abroad to form the patented invention at issue. Here, as we have repeatedly noted, see <i>supra,</i> at 1750-1751, 1752-1753, the copies of Windows actually installed on the foreign computers were not themselves supplied from the United States.<sup>[14]</sup> Indeed, those copies did not exist until they were generated by third parties outside the United States.<sup>[15]</sup> Copying software abroad, all might agree, is indeed easy and inexpensive. But the same could be said of other items: \"Keys or machine parts might be copied from a master; chemical or biological substances might be created by reproduction; and paper products might be made by electronic copying and printing.\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 24. See also <i>supra,</i> at 1755-1756 (rejecting argument similarly based on ease of copying in construing \"component\"). Section 271(f) contains no instruction to gauge when duplication is easy and cheap enough to deem a copy in fact made abroad nevertheless \"supplie[d] ... from the United States.\" The absence of anything addressing copying in the statutory text weighs against a judicial determination that replication abroad of a master dispatched from the United States \"supplies\" the foreign-made copies from the United States within the intendment of ß 271(f).<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1758</span> D</h2>\n<p>Any doubt that Microsoft's conduct falls outside ß 271(f)'s compass would be resolved by the presumption against extraterritoriality, on which we have already touched. See <i>supra,</i> at 1750-1751, 1752. The presumption that United States law governs domestically but does not rule the world applies with particular force in patent law. The traditional understanding that our patent law \"operate[s] only domestically and d[oes] not extend to foreign activities,\" Fisch &amp; Allen, <i>supra,</i> at 559, is embedded in the Patent Act itself, which provides that a patent confers exclusive rights in an invention within the United States. 35 U.S.C. ß 154(a)(1) (patentee's rights over invention apply to manufacture, use, or sale \"throughout the United States\" and to importation \"into the United States\"). See <i>Deepsouth,</i> 406 U.S., at 531, 92 S.Ct. 1700 (\"Our patent system makes no claim to extraterritorial effect\"; our legislation \"d[oes] not, and [was] not intended to, operate beyond the limits of the United States, and we correspondingly reject the claims of others to such control over our markets.\" (quoting <i>Brown,</i> 19 How., at 195, 15 L.Ed. 595)).</p>\n<p>As a principle of general application, moreover, we have stated that courts should \"assume that legislators take account of the legitimate sovereign interests of other nations when they write American laws.\" <i>F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S. A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136989\"><a href=\"/opinion/136989/f-hoffmann-la-roche-ltd-v-empagran-sa/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span>, 164, 124 S.Ct. 2359, 159 L.Ed.2d 226 (2004); see <i>EEOC v.

Thus, the United States accurately conveyed in this case: \"Foreign conduct is [generally] the domain of foreign law,\" and in the area here involved, in particular, foreign law \"may embody different policy judgments about the relative rights of inventors, competitors, and the public in patented inventions.\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 28. Applied to this case, the presumption tugs strongly against construction of ß 271(f) to encompass as a \"component\" not only a physical copy of software, but also software's intangible code, and to render \"supplie[d]... from the United States\" not only exported copies of software, but also duplicates made abroad.</p>\n<p>AT &amp; T argues that the presumption is inapplicable because Congress enacted ß 271(f) specifically to extend the reach of United States patent law to cover certain activity abroad. But as this Court has explained, \"the presumption is not defeated... just because [a statute] specifically addresses [an] issue of extraterritorial application,\" <i>Smith v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112827\"><a href=\"/opinion/112827/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 204, 113 S.Ct. 1178, 122 L.Ed.2d 548 (1993); it remains instructive in determining the <i>extent</i> of the statutory exception. See <i>Empagran,</i> 542 U.S., at 161-162, 164-165, 124 S.Ct. 2359; <i>Smith,</i> 507 U.S., at 204, 113 S.Ct. 1178.</p>\n<p>AT &amp; T alternately contends that the presumption holds no sway here given that ß 271(f), by its terms, applies only to domestic conduct, <i>i.e.,</i> to the supply of a patented invention's components \"from the United States.\" ß 271(f)(1). AT &amp; T's reading, however, \"converts a single act of supply from the United States into a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1759</span> springboard for liability each time a copy of the software is subsequently made [abroad] and combined with computer hardware [abroad] for sale [abroad.]\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 29; see 414 F.3d, at 1373, 1375 (Rader, J., dissenting). In short, foreign law alone, not United States law, currently governs the manufacture and sale of components of patented inventions in foreign countries. If AT &amp; T desires to prevent copying in foreign countries, its remedy today lies in obtaining and enforcing foreign patents. See <i>Deepsouth,</i> 406 U.S., at 531, 92 S.Ct. 1700.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>AT &amp; T urges that reading ß 271(f) to cover only those copies of software actually dispatched from the United States creates a \"loophole\" for software makers. Liability for infringing a United States patent could be avoided, as Microsoft's practice shows, by an easily arranged circumvention: Instead of making installation copies of software in the United States, the copies can be made abroad, swiftly and at small cost, by generating them from a master supplied from the United States. The Federal Circuit majority found AT &amp; T's plea compelling:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Were we to hold that Microsoft's supply by exportation of the master versions of the Windows &amp; reg; softwareÄî specifically for the purpose of foreign replicationÄîavoids infringement, we would be subverting the remedial nature of ß 271(f), permitting a technical avoidance of the statute by ignoring the advances in a field of technologyÄîand its associated industry practicesÄîthat developed after the enactment of ß 271(f).... Section ß 271(f), if it is to remain effective, must therefore be interpreted in a manner that is appropriate to the nature of the technology at issue.\" 414 F.3d, at 1371.</blockquote>\n<p>While the majority's concern is understandable, we are not persuaded that dynamic judicial interpretation of ß 271(f) is in order. The \"loophole,\" in our judgment, is properly left for Congress to consider, and to close if it finds such action warranted.</p>\n<p>There is no dispute, we note again, that ß 271(f) is inapplicable to the export of design toolsÄîblueprints, schematics, templates, and prototypesÄîall of which may provide the information required to construct and combine overseas the components of inventions patented under United States law. See <i>supra,</i> at 1755-1756. We have no license to attribute to Congress an unstated intention to place the information Microsoft dispatched from the United States in a separate category.</p>\n<p>Section 271(f) was a direct response to a gap in our patent law revealed by this Court's <i>Deepsouth</i> decision. See <i>supra,</i> at 1752, and n. 3. The facts of that case were undeniably at the fore when ß 271(f) was in the congressional hopper. In <i>Deepsouth,</i> the items exported were kits containing all the physical, readily assemblable parts of a shrimp deveining machine (not an intangible set of instructions), and those parts themselves (not foreign-made copies of them) would be combined abroad by foreign buyers. Having attended to the gap made evident in <i>Deepsouth,</i> Congress did not address other arguable gaps: Section 271(f) does not identify as an infringing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1760</span> act conduct in the United States that facilitates making a component of a patented invention outside the United States; nor does the provision check \"suppl[ying]... from the United States\" information, instructions, or other materials needed to make copies abroad.<sup>[18]</sup> Given that Congress did not home in on the loophole AT &amp; T describes, and in view of the expanded extraterritorial thrust AT &amp; T's reading of ß 271(f) entails, our precedent leads us to leave in Congress' court the patent-protective determination AT &amp; T seeks.

This \"`source code'\" is then generally converted by the computer into a \"machine readable code\" or \"machine language\" expressed in a binary format. Brief for Respondent 5, n. 1 (citing R. White, How Computers Work 87, 94 (8th ed.2006)); E. Walters, Essential Guide to Computing 204-205 (2001). During the Windows writing process, the program exists in the form of machine readable code on the magnetic tape fields of Microsoft's computers' hard drives. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1761</span> White, <i>supra,</i> at 144-145; Walters, <i>supra,</i> at 54-55.</p>\n<p>When Microsoft finishes writing its Windows program in the United States, it encodes Windows onto CD-ROMs known as \"`golden masters'\" in the form of machine readable code.

The intact CD-ROM is then removed and may be discarded without affecting the computer's implementation of the code.<sup>[*]</sup> The parties agree for purposes of this litigation that a foreign-made computer containing the Windows code would violate AT &amp; T's patent if present in the United States. Pet. for Cert. 42a, ∂ 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>I agree with the Court that a component of a machine, whether a shrimp deveiner or a personal computer, must be something physical. <i>Ante,</i> at 1754-1756. This is because the word \"component,\" when concerning a physical device, is most naturally read to mean a physical part of the device. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 466 (1976) (component is a \"constituent part: INGREDIENT\"); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 301 (1967) (component is a \"a component part; constituent\"). Furthermore, ß 271(f) requires that the component be \"combined\" with other components to form the infringing device, meaning that the component must remain a part of any. Webster's, <i>supra,</i> at 452 (combine means \"to join in physical or chemical union\"; \"to become one\"; \"to unite into a chemical compound\"); Random House, <i>supra,</i> at 293 (combine means \"to bring or join into a close union or whole\"). For these reasons, I agree with the Court that a set of instructions on how to build an infringing device, or even a template of the device, does not qualify as a component. <i>Ante,</i> at 1754-1755.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>As the parties agree, an inventor can patent a machine that carries out a certain process, and a computer may constitute such a machine when it executes commandsÄîgiven to it by codeÄîthat allow it to carry out that process. Such a computer would not become an infringing device until enough of the code is installed on the computer to allow it to execute the process in question. The computer would not be an infringing device prior to the installation, or even during the installation. And the computer remains an infringing device after the installation process because, even though the original installation device (such as a CD-ROM) has been removed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1762</span> from the computer, the code remains on the hard drive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Here, Windows software originating in the United States was sent abroad, whether on a master disk or by means of an electronic transmission, and eventually copied onto the hard drives of the foreign-made computers. Once the copying process was completed, the Windows program was recorded in a physical form, <i>i.e.,</i> in magnetic fields on the computers' hard drives. See Brief for Respondent 5. The physical form of the Windows program on the master disk, <i>i.e.,</i> the engravings on the CD-ROM, remained on the disk in a form unchanged by the copying process. See Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 2 (citing White, How Computers Work, at 144-145, 172-173). There is nothing in the record to suggest that any physical part of the disk became a physical part of the foreign-made computer, and such an occurrence would be contrary to the general workings of computers.</p>\n<p>Because no physical object originating in the United States was combined with these computers, there was no violation of ß 271(f). Accordingly, it is irrelevant that the Windows software was not copied onto the foreign-made computers <i>directly</i> from the master disk or from an electronic transmission that originated in the United States. To be sure, if these computers could not run Windows without inserting and keeping a CD-ROM in the appropriate drive, then the CD-ROMs might be components of the computer. But that is not the case here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Because the physical incarnation of code on the Windows CD-ROM supplied from the United States is not a \"component\" of an infringing device under ß 271(f), it logically follows that a copy of such a CD-ROM also is not a component. For this reason, I join the Court's opinion, except for footnote 14.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>As the Court acknowledges, \"[p]lausible arguments can be made for and against extending ß 271(f) to the conduct charged in this case as infringing AT &amp; T's patent.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1751. Strong policy considerations, buttressed by the presumption against the application of domestic patent law in foreign markets, support Microsoft Corporation's position. I am, however, persuaded that an affirmance of the Court of Appeals' judgment is more faithful to the intent of the Congress that enacted ß 271(f) than a reversal.</p>\n<p>The provision was a response to our decision in <i>Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108547\"><a href=\"/opinion/108547/deepsouth-packing-co-v-laitram-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 92 S.Ct. 1700, 32 L.Ed.2d 273 (1972), holding that a patent on a shrimp deveining machine had not been infringed by the export of components for assembly abroad. Paragraph (1) of ß 271(f) would have been sufficient on its own to overrule <i>Deepsouth,</i><sup>[*]</sup> but it is paragraph (2) that best supports AT &amp; T's position here. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States any component of a patented invention that is especially made <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1763</span> or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, where such component is uncombined in whole or in part, knowing that such component is so made or adapted and intending that such component will be combined outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.\" ß 271(f)(2).</blockquote>\n<p>Under this provision, the export of a specially designed knife that has no use other than as a part of a patented deveining machine would constitute infringement. It follows that ß 271(f)(2) would cover the export of an inventory of such knives to be warehoused until used to complete the assembly of an infringing machine.</p>\n<p>The relevant component in this case is not a physical item like a knife. Both Microsoft and the Court think that means it cannot be a \"component.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 1755. But if a disk with software inscribed on it is a \"component,\" I find it difficult to understand why the most important ingredient of that component is not also a component. Indeed, the master disk is the functional equivalent of a warehouse of componentsÄîcomponents that Microsoft fully expects to be incorporated into foreign-manufactured computers. Put somewhat differently: On the Court's view, Microsoft could be liable under ß 271(f) only if it sends individual copies of its software directly from the United States with the intent that each copy would be incorporated into a separate infringing computer. But it seems to me that an indirect transmission via a master disk warehouse is likewise covered by ß 271(f).</p>\n<p>I disagree with the Court's suggestion that because software is analogous to an abstract set of instructions, it cannot be regarded as a \"component\" within the meaning of ß 271(f). See <i>ante,</i> at 1754-1755. Whether attached or detached from any medium, software plainly satisfies the dictionary definition of that word. See <i>ante,</i> at 1755, n. 11 (observing that \"`[c]omponent' is commonly defined as `a constituent part,' `element,' or `ingredient' \"). And unlike a blueprint that merely instructs a user how to do something, software actually causes infringing conduct to occur. It is more like a roller that causes a player piano to produce sound than sheet music that tells a pianist what to do. Moreover, it is surely not \"a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use\" as that term is used in ß 271(f)(2). On the contrary, its sole intended use is an infringing use.</p>\n<p>I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Deepsouth shipped its deveining equipment \"to foreign customers in three separate boxes, each containing only parts of the 1æton machines, yet the whole [was] assemblable in less than one hour.\" <i>Deepsouth Packing Co. v.

Cf. <i>infra,</i> at 1757-1758, n. 16 (explaining why both paragraphs yield the same result). For clarity's sake, we focus our analysis on the text of ß 271(f)(1).</p>\n<p>[8]  Microsoft and the United States stress that to count as a component, the copy of software must be expressed as \"object code.\" \"Software in the form in which it is written and understood by humans is called `source code.' To be functional, however, software must be converted (or `compiled') into its machine-usable version,\" a sequence of binary number instructions typed \"object code.\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 4, n. 1; 71 USPQ 2d 1118, 1119, n. 5, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">406640</span></span> (S.D.N.Y.2004) (recounting Microsoft's description of the software development process). It is stipulated that object code was on the master disks and electronic transmissions Microsoft dispatched from the United States.</p>\n<p>[9]  On this view of \"component,\" the copies of Windows on the master disks and electronic transmissions that Microsoft sent from the United States could not themselves serve as a basis for liability, because those copies were not installed on the foreign manufacturers' computers. See ß 271(f)(1) (encompassing only those components \"combin[ed] ... outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States\").</p>\n<p>[10]  The Federal Circuit panel in this case, relying on that court's prior decision in <i>Eolas Technologies Inc. v.

We are unable to determine, however, whether the Federal Circuit panels regarded as a component software in the abstract, or a copy of software.</p>\n<p>[11]  \"Component\" is commonly defined as \"a constituent part,\" \"element,\" or \"ingredient.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 466 (1981).</p>\n<p>[12]  The dissent, embracing AT &amp; T's argument, contends that, \"unlike a blueprint that merely instructs a user how to do something, software actually causes infringing conduct to occur.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1763 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). We have emphasized, however, that Windows can \"caus[e] infringing conduct to occur\"Äî<i>i.e.,</i> function as part of AT &amp; T's speech-processing computerÄîonly when expressed as a computer-readable copy. Abstracted from a usable copy, Windows code is intangible, uncombinable information, more like notes of music in the head of a composer than \"a roller that causes a player piano to produce sound.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>[13]  We need not address whether software in the abstract, or any other intangible, can <i>ever</i> be a component under ß 271(f). If an intangible method or process, for instance, qualifies as a \"patented invention\" under ß 271(f) (a question as to which we express no opinion), the combinable components of that invention might be intangible as well. The invention before us, however, AT &amp; T's speech-processing computer, is a tangible thing.</p>\n<p>[14]  In a footnote, Microsoft suggests that even a disk shipped from the United States, and used to install Windows directly on a foreign computer, would not give rise to liability under ß 271(f) if the disk were removed after installation. See Brief for Petitioner 37, n. 11; cf. <i>post,</i> at 1761-1762 (ALITO, J., concurring). We need not and do not reach that issue here.</p>\n<p>[15]  The dissent analogizes Microsoft's supply of master versions of Windows abroad to \"the export of an inventory of ... knives to be warehoused until used to complete the assembly of an infringing machine.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1761. But as we have underscored, foreign-made copies of Windows, not the masters Microsoft dispatched from the United States, were installed on the computers here involved. A more apt analogy, therefore, would be the export of knives for <i>copying</i> abroad, with the foreign-made <i>copies</i> \"warehoused until used to complete the assembly of an infringing machine.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Without stretching ß 271(f) beyond the text Congress composed, a copy made entirely abroad does not fit the description \"supplie[d] ... from the United States.\"</p>\n<p>[16]  Our analysis, while focusing on ß 271(f)(1), is equally applicable to ß 271(f)(2). But cf. <i>post,</i> at 1762 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (asserting \"paragraph (2) ... best supports AT &amp; T's position here\"). While the two paragraphs differ, among other things, on the quantity of components that must be \"supplie[d]... from the United States\" for liability to attach, see <i>infra,</i> at 1760, n. 18, that distinction does not affect our analysis. Paragraph (2), like (1), covers only a \"component\" amenable to \"combination.\" ß 271(f)(2); see <i>supra,</i> at 1754-1756 (explaining why Windows in the abstract is not a combinable component). Paragraph (2), like (1), encompasses only the \"[s]uppl[y] ... from the United States\" of \"such [a] component\" as will itself \"be combined outside of the United States.\" ß 271(f)(2); see <i>supra,</i> at 1756-1757 and this page (observing that foreign-made copies of Windows installed on computers abroad were not \"supplie[d] ... from the United States\"). It is thus unsurprising that AT &amp; T does not join the dissent in suggesting that the outcome might turn on whether we view the case under paragraph (1) or (2).</p>\n<p>[17]  AT &amp; T has secured patents for its speech processor in Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, and Sweden. App. in No. 04-1285 (CA Fed.), p. 1477. AT &amp; T and its <i>amici</i> do not relate what protections and remedies are, or are not, available under these foreign regimes. Cf.

Argued February 21, 2007—Decided April 30, 2007\nIt is the general rule under United States patent law that no infringe\n   ment occurs when a patented product is made and sold in another\n   country. There is an exception. Section 271(f) of the Patent Act,\n   adopted in 1984, provides that infringement does occur when one\n   “suppl[ies] . . . from the United States,” for “combination” abroad, a\n   patented invention’s “components.” 35 U. S. C. §271(f)(1). This case\n   concerns the applicability of §271(f) to computer software first sent\n   from the United States to a foreign manufacturer on a master disk,\n   or by electronic transmission, then copied by the foreign recipient for\n   installation on computers made and sold abroad.\n      AT&T holds a patent on a computer used to digitally encode and\n   compress recorded speech. Microsoft’s Windows operating system\n   has the potential to infringe that patent because Windows incorpo\n   rates software code that, when installed, enables a computer to proc\n   ess speech in the manner claimed by the patent. Microsoft sells Win\n   dows to foreign manufacturers who install the software onto the\n   computers they sell. Microsoft sends each manufacturer a master\n   version of Windows, either on a disk or via encrypted electronic\n   transmission, which the manufacturer uses to generate copies. Those\n   copies, not the master version sent by Microsoft, are installed on the\n   foreign manufacturer’s computers. The foreign-made computers are\n   then sold to users abroad.\n      AT&T filed an infringement suit charging Microsoft with liability\n   for the foreign installations of Windows. By sending Windows to for\n   eign manufacturers, AT&T contended, Microsoft “supplie[d] . . . from\n   the United States,” for “combination” abroad, “components” of\n   AT&T’s patented speech-processing computer, and, accordingly, was\n   liable under §271(f). Microsoft responded that unincorporated soft\n2                  MICROSOFT CORP. v. AT&T CORP.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ware, because it is intangible information, cannot be typed a “compo\n    nent” of an invention under §271(f). Microsoft also urged that the\n    foreign-generated copies of Windows actually installed abroad were\n    not “supplie[d] . . . from the United States.” Rejecting these re\n    sponses, the District Court held Microsoft liable under §271(f), and a\n    divided Federal Circuit panel affirmed.\nHeld: Because Microsoft does not export from the United States the\n copies of Windows installed on the foreign-made computers in ques\n tion, Microsoft does not “suppl[y] . . . from the United States” “com\n ponents” of those computers, and therefore is not liable under §271(f)\n as currently written. Pp. 7–19.\n    (a) A copy of Windows, not Windows in the abstract, qualifies as a\n “component” under §271(f). Section 271(f) attaches liability to the\n supply abroad of the “components of a patented invention, where\n such components are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner\n as to actively induce the combination of such components.” §271(f)(1)\n (emphasis added). The provision thus applies only to “such compo\n nents” as are combined to form the “patented invention” at issue—\n here, AT&T’s speech-processing computer. Until expressed as a com\n puter-readable “copy,” e.g., on a CD-ROM, Windows—indeed any\n software detached from an activating medium—remains uncom\n binable. It cannot be inserted into a CD-ROM drive or downloaded\n from the Internet; it cannot be installed or executed on a computer.\n Abstract software code is an idea without physical embodiment, and\n as such, it does not match §271(f)’s categorization: “components”\n amenable to “combination.” Windows abstracted from a tangible copy\n no doubt is information—a detailed set of instructions—and thus\n might be compared to a blueprint (or anything else containing design\n information). A blueprint may contain precise instructions for the\n construction and combination of the components of a patented device,\n but it is not itself a combinable component.\n    The fact that it is easy to encode software’s instructions onto a com\n puter-readable medium does not counsel a different answer. The\n copy-producing step is what renders software a usable, combinable\n part of a computer; easy or not, the extra step is essential. Moreover,\n many tools may be used easily and inexpensively to generate the\n parts of a device. Those tools are not, however, “components” of the\n devices in which the parts are incorporated, at least not under any\n ordinary understanding of the term “component.” Congress might\n have included within §271(f)’s compass, for example, not only a pat\n ented invention’s combinable “components,” but also “information, in\n structions, or tools from which those components readily may be gen\n erated.” It did not. Pp. 9–12.\n    (b) Microsoft did not “suppl[y] . . . from the United States” the for\n                   Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\neign-made copies of Windows installed on the computers here in\nvolved. Under a conventional reading of §271(f)’s text, those copies\nwere “supplie[d]” from outside the United States. The Federal Cir\ncuit majority concluded, however, that for software components, the\nact of copying is subsumed in the act of supplying. A master sent\nabroad, the majority observed, differs not at all from exact copies,\ngenerated easily, inexpensively, and swiftly from the master. Hence,\nsending a single copy of software abroad with the intent that it be\nreplicated invokes §271(f) liability for the foreign-made copies. Judge\nRader, dissenting, noted that “supplying” is ordinarily understood to\nmean an activity separate and distinct from any subsequent “copy\ning,” “replicating,” or “reproducing”—in effect, manufacturing. He\nfurther observed that the only true difference between software com\nponents and physical components of other patented inventions is that\ncopies of software are easier to make and transport. But nothing in\n§271(f)’s text, Judge Rader maintained, renders ease of copying a\nrelevant, no less decisive, factor in triggering liability for infringe\nment. The Court agrees. Under §271(f)’s text, the very components\nsupplied from the United States, and not foreign-made copies thereof,\ntrigger liability when combined abroad to form the patented inven\ntion at issue. While copying software abroad is indeed easy and in\nexpensive, the same can be said of other items, such as keys copied\nfrom a master. Section 271(f) contains no instruction to gauge when\nduplication is easy and cheap enough to deem a copy in fact made\nabroad nevertheless “supplie[d] . . . from the United States.” The ab\nsence of anything addressing copying in the statutory text weighs\nagainst a judicial determination that replication abroad of a master\ndispatched from the United States “supplies” the foreign-made copies\nfrom this country. Pp. 12–14.\n   (c) Any doubt that Microsoft’s conduct falls outside §271(f)’s com\npass would be resolved by the presumption against extraterritorial\nity. Foreign conduct is generally the domain of foreign law, and in\nthe patent area, that law may embody different policy judgments\nabout the relative rights of inventors, competitors, and the public.\nApplied here, the presumption tugs strongly against construing\n§271(f) to encompass as a “component” not only a physical copy of\nsoftware, but also software’s intangible code, and to render “sup\nplie[d] . . . from the United States” not only exported copies of soft\nware, but also duplicates made abroad. Foreign law alone, not\nUnited States law, currently governs the manufacture and sale of\ncomponents of patented inventions in foreign countries. If AT&T de\nsires to prevent copying abroad, its remedy lies in obtaining and en\nforcing foreign patents.

Section 271(f)\n    was a direct response to a gap in U. S. patent law revealed by Deep-\n    south Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U. S. 518, where the items\n    exported were kits containing all the physical, readily assemblable\n    parts of a machine (not an intangible set of instructions), and those\n    parts themselves (not foreign-made copies of them) would be com\n    bined abroad by foreign buyers. Having attended to that gap, Con\n    gress did not address other arguable gaps, such as the loophole AT&T\n    describes. Given the expanded extraterritorial thrust AT&T’s read\n    ing of §271(f) entails, the patent-protective determination AT&T\n    seeks must be left to Congress. Cf. Sony Corp. of America v. Univer\n    sal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, 431. Congress is doubtless\n    aware of the ease with which electronic media such as software can\n    be copied, and has not left the matter untouched. See the Digital\n    Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U. S. C. §1201 et seq.

There is an exception.\nSection 271(f) of the Patent Act, adopted in 1984, provides\nthat infringement does occur when one “supplies . . . from\nthe United States,” for “combination” abroad, a patented\ninvention’s “components.” 35 U. S. C. §271(f)(1). This case\nconcerns the applicability of §271(f) to computer software\nfirst sent from the United States to a foreign manufac\nturer on a master disk, or by electronic transmission, then\ncopied by the foreign recipient for installation on com\nputers made and sold abroad.\n   AT&T holds a patent on an apparatus for digitally\nencoding and compressing recorded speech. Microsoft’s\nWindows operating system, it is conceded, has the poten\ntial to infringe AT&T’s patent, because Windows incorpo\nrates software code that, when installed, enables a com\nputer to process speech in the manner claimed by that\npatent. It bears emphasis, however, that uninstalled\n2             MICROSOFT CORP. v. AT&T CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nWindows software does not infringe AT&T’s patent any\nmore than a computer standing alone does; instead, the\npatent is infringed only when a computer is loaded with\nWindows and is thereby rendered capable of performing as\nthe patented speech processor. The question before us:\nDoes Microsoft’s liability extend to computers made in\nanother country when loaded with Windows software\ncopied abroad from a master disk or electronic transmis\nsion dispatched by Microsoft from the United States? Our\nanswer is “No.”\n  The master disk or electronic transmission Microsoft\nsends from the United States is never installed on any of\nthe foreign-made computers in question. Instead, copies\nmade abroad are used for installation. Because Microsoft\ndoes not export from the United States the copies actually\ninstalled, it does not “suppl[y] . . . from the United States”\n“components” of the relevant computers, and therefore is\nnot liable under §271(f) as currently written.\n  Plausible arguments can be made for and against ex\ntending §271(f) to the conduct charged in this case as\ninfringing AT&T’s patent. Recognizing that §271(f) is an\nexception to the general rule that our patent law does not\napply extraterritorially, we resist giving the language in\nwhich Congress cast §271(f) an expansive interpretation.\nOur decision leaves to Congress’ informed judgment any\nadjustment of §271(f) it deems necessary or proper.\n                             I\n  Our decision some 35 years ago in Deepsouth Packing\nCo. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U. S. 518 (1972), a case about a\nshrimp deveining machine, led Congress to enact §271(f).\nIn that case, Laitram, holder of a patent on the time-and\nexpense-saving machine, sued Deepsouth, manufacturer of\nan infringing deveiner. Deepsouth conceded that the\nPatent Act barred it from making and selling its deveining\nmachine in the United States, but sought to salvage a\n                     Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nportion of its business: Nothing in United States patent\nlaw, Deepsouth urged, stopped it from making in the\nUnited States the parts of its deveiner, as opposed to the\nmachine itself, and selling those parts to foreign buyers for\nassembly and use abroad. Id., at 522–524.1 We agreed.\n   Interpreting our patent law as then written, we reiter\nated in Deepsouth that it was “not an infringement to\nmake or use a patented product outside of the United\nStates.” Id., at 527; see 35 U. S. C. §271(a) (1970 ed.)\n(“[W]hoever without authority makes, uses or sells any\npatented invention, within the United States during the\nterm of the patent therefor, infringes the patent.”). Deep-\nsouth’s foreign buyers did not infringe Laitram’s patent,\nwe held, because they assembled and used the deveining\nmachines outside the United States. Deepsouth, we there\nfore concluded, could not be charged with inducing or\ncontributing to an infringement. 406 U. S., at 526–527.2\nNor could Deepsouth be held liable as a direct infringer,\nfor it did not make, sell, or use the patented invention—\nthe fully assembled deveining machine—within the\nUnited States. The parts of the machine were not them\nselves patented, we noted, hence export of those parts,\nunassembled, did not rank as an infringement of\nLaitram’s patent. Id., at 527–529.\n   Laitram had argued in Deepsouth that resistance to\nextension of the patent privilege to cover exported parts\n——————\n  1 Deepsouth  shipped its deveining equipment “to foreign customers in\nthree separate boxes, each containing only parts of the 1¾-ton ma\nchines, yet the whole [was] assemblable in less than one hour.” Deep-\nsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U. S. 518, 524 (1972).\n   2 See 35 U. S. C. §271(b) (1970 ed.) (“Whoever actively induces in\n\nfringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.”); §271(c) (render\ning liable as a contributory infringer anyone who sells or imports a\n“component” of a patented invention, “knowing the same to be espe\ncially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such\npatent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for\nsubstantial non-infringing use”).\n4                MICROSOFT CORP. v. AT&T CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n“derived from too narrow and technical an interpretation\nof the [Patent Act].” Id., at 529. Rejecting that argument,\nwe referred to prior decisions holding that “a combination\npatent protects only against the operable assembly of the\nwhole and not the manufacture of its parts.” Id., at 528.\nCongress’ codification of patent law, we said, signaled no\nintention to broaden the scope of the privilege. Id., at 530\n(“When, as here, the Constitution is permissive, the sign of\nhow far Congress has chosen to go can come only from\nCongress.”). And we again emphasized that\n       “[o]ur patent system makes no claim to extraterrito\n       rial effect; these acts of Congress do not, and were not\n       intended to, operate beyond the limits of the United\n       States; and we correspondingly reject the claims of\n       others to such control over our markets.” Id., at 531\n       (quoting Brown v. Duchesne, 19 How. 183, 195 (1857)).\nAbsent “a clear congressional indication of intent,” we\nstated, courts had no warrant to stop the manufacture and\nsale of the parts of patented inventions for assembly and\nuse abroad. 406 U. S., at 532.\n  Focusing its attention on Deepsouth, Congress enacted\n§271(f).

App. to\nPet. for Cert. 45a–46a.4\n   AT&T’s patent (’580 patent) is for an apparatus (as\nrelevant here, a computer) capable of digitally encoding\nand compressing recorded speech. Windows, the parties\nagree, contains software that enables a computer to proc\ness speech in the manner claimed by the ’580 patent. In\n2001, AT&T filed an infringement suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork, charging Microsoft with liability for domestic and\nforeign installations of Windows.\n   Neither Windows software (e.g., in a box on the shelf)\nnor a computer standing alone (i.e., without Windows\ninstalled) infringes AT&T’s patent. Infringement occurs\nonly when Windows is installed on a computer, thereby\nrendering it capable of performing as the patented speech\nprocessor. Microsoft stipulated that by installing Win\ndows on its own computers during the software develop\nment process, it directly infringed the ’580 patent.5 Micro-\nsoft further acknowledged that by licensing copies of\nWindows to manufacturers of computers sold in the\nUnited States, it induced infringement of AT&T’s patent.6\nId., at 42a; Brief for Petitioner 3–4; Brief for Respondent\n9, 19.\n   Microsoft denied, however, any liability based on the\nmaster disks and electronic transmissions it dispatched to\n——————\n   4 Microsoft also distributes Windows to foreign manufacturers indi\n\nrectly, by sending a master version to an authorized foreign “replica\ntor”; the replicator then makes copies and ships them to the manufac\nturers.

See supra, at 5 (reproducing\ntext of §271(f)). Microsoft responded that unincorporated\nsoftware, because it is intangible information, cannot be\ntyped a “component” of an invention under §271(f). In any\nevent, Microsoft urged, the foreign-generated copies of\nWindows actually installed abroad were not “supplie[d] . . .\nfrom the United States.” Rejecting these responses, the\nDistrict Court held Microsoft liable under §271(f). 71\nUSPQ 2d 1118 (SDNY 2004).

Second, were “components” of the foreign-made\ncomputers involved in this case “supplie[d]” by Microsoft\n“from the United States”? 7\n   As to the first question, no one in this litigation argues\nthat software can never rank as a “component” under\n§271(f). The parties disagree, however, over the stage at\nwhich software becomes a component. Software, the “set\nof instructions, known as code, that directs a computer to\n——————\n   7 The record leaves unclear which paragraph of §271(f) AT&T’s claim\n\ninvokes. While there are differences between §271(f)(1) and (f)(2), see,\ne.g., infra, at 18, n. 18, the parties do not suggest that those differences\nare outcome determinative. Cf. infra, at 14–15, n. 16 (explaining why\nboth paragraphs yield the same result). For clarity’s sake, we focus our\nanalysis on the text of §271(f)(1).\n8                MICROSOFT CORP. v. AT&T CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nperform specified functions or operations,” Fantasy Sports\nProperties, Inc. v. Sportsline.com, Inc., 287 F. 3d 1108,\n1118 (CA Fed. 2002), can be conceptualized in (at least)\ntwo ways. One can speak of software in the abstract: the\ninstructions themselves detached from any medium. (An\nanalogy: The notes of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.) One\ncan alternatively envision a tangible “copy” of software,\nthe instructions encoded on a medium such as a CD-ROM.\n(Sheet music for Beethoven’s Ninth.) AT&T argues that\nsoftware in the abstract, not simply a particular copy of\nsoftware, qualifies as a “component” under §271(f). Micro-\nsoft and the United States argue that only a copy of soft\nware, not software in the abstract, can be a component.8\n  The significance of these diverse views becomes appar\nent when we turn to the second question: Were compo\nnents of the foreign-made computers involved in this case\n“supplie[d]” by Microsoft “from the United States”? If the\nrelevant components are the copies of Windows actually\ninstalled on the foreign computers, AT&T could not per\nsuasively argue that those components, though generated\nabroad, were “supplie[d] . . . from the United States” as\n§271(f) requires for liability to attach.9 If, on the other\n——————\n   8 Microsoft and the United States stress that to count as a component,\n\nthe copy of software must be expressed as “object code.” “Software in\nthe form in which it is written and understood by humans is called\n‘source code.’ To be functional, however, software must be converted (or\n‘compiled’) into its machine-usable version,” a sequence of binary\nnumber instructions typed “object code.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 4, n. 1; 71 USPQ 2d 1118, 1119, n. 5 (SDNY 2004)\n(recounting Microsoft’s description of the software development proc\ness). It is stipulated that object code was on the master disks and\nelectronic transmissions Microsoft dispatched from the United States.\n   9 On this view of “component,” the copies of Windows on the master\n\ndisks and electronic transmissions that Microsoft sent from the United\nStates could not themselves serve as a basis for liability, because those\ncopies were not installed on the foreign manufacturers’ computers. See\n§271(f)(1) (encompassing only those components “combin[ed] . . . outside\nof the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such\n                      Cite as: 550 U.

We construe §271(f)’s terms\n“in accordance with [their] ordinary or natural meaning.”\nFDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 476 (1994). Section 271(f)\napplies to the supply abroad of the “components of a pat\nented invention, where such components are uncombined\nin whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce\nthe combination of such components.” §271(f)(1) (emphasis\nadded). The provision thus applies only to “such compo\nnents”11 as are combined to form the “patented invention”\nat issue. The patented invention here is AT&T’s speech-\nprocessing computer.\n  Until it is expressed as a computer-readable “copy,” e.g.,\non a CD-ROM, Windows software—indeed any software\ndetached from an activating medium—remains uncom\nbinable. It cannot be inserted into a CD-ROM drive or\ndownloaded from the Internet; it cannot be installed or\nexecuted on a computer. Abstract software code is an idea\n——————\ncombination occurred within the United States”).\n   10 The Federal Circuit panel in this case, relying on that court’s prior\n\ndecision in Eolas Technologies Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 399 F. 3d 1325\n(2005), held that software qualifies as a component under §271(f). We\nare unable to determine, however, whether the Federal Circuit panels\nregarded as a component software in the abstract, or a copy of software.\n   11 “Component” is commonly defined as “a constituent part,” “ele\n\nment,” or “ingredient.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary\nof the English Language 466 (1981).\n10            MICROSOFT CORP. v. AT&T CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwithout physical embodiment, and as such, it does not\nmatch §271(f)’s categorization: “components” amenable to\n“combination.” Windows abstracted from a tangible copy\nno doubt is information—a detailed set of instructions—\nand thus might be compared to a blueprint (or anything\ncontaining design information, e.g., a schematic, template,\nor prototype). A blueprint may contain precise instruc\ntions for the construction and combination of the compo\nnents of a patented device, but it is not itself a combinable\ncomponent of that device. AT&T and its amici do not\nsuggest otherwise. Cf. Pellegrini v. Analog Devices, Inc.,\n375 F. 3d 1113, 1117–1119 (CA Fed. 2004) (transmission\nabroad of instructions for production of patented computer\nchips not covered by §271(f)).\n   AT&T urges that software, at least when expressed as\nmachine-readable object code, is distinguishable from\ndesign information presented in a blueprint. Software,\nunlike a blueprint, is “modular”; it is a stand-alone prod\nuct developed and marketed “for use on many different\ntypes of computer hardware and in conjunction with many\nother types of software.” Brief for Respondent 5; Tr. of\nOral Arg. 46. Software’s modularity persists even after\ninstallation; it can be updated or removed (deleted) with\nout affecting the hardware on which it is installed.

After a device has been built according to a blue\nprint’s instructions, the blueprint’s work is done (as AT&T\nputs it, the blueprint’s instructions have been “exhausted,”\nibid.).

Blueprints too, or any\ndesign information for that matter, can be independently\ndeveloped, bought, and sold. If the point of AT&T’s\nargument is that we do not see blueprints lining stores’\nshelves, the same observation may be made about soft\nware in the abstract: What retailers sell, and consumers\nbuy, are copies of software. Likewise, before software\ncan be contained in and continuously performed by a\ncomputer, before it can be updated or deleted, an actual,\nphysical copy of the software must be delivered by CD\nROM or some other means capable of interfacing with\nthe computer.12\n  Because it is so easy to encode software’s instructions\nonto a medium that can be read by a computer, AT&T\nintimates, that extra step should not play a decisive role\nunder §271(f). But the extra step is what renders the\nsoftware a usable, combinable part of a computer; easy or\nnot, the copy-producing step is essential. Moreover, many\ntools may be used easily and inexpensively to generate the\nparts of a device. A machine for making sprockets might\nbe used by a manufacturer to produce tens of thousands of\nsprockets an hour. That does not make the machine a\n“component” of the tens of thousands of devices in which\nthe sprockets are incorporated, at least not under any\nordinary understanding of the term “component.” Con\n——————\n  12 The dissent, embracing AT&T’s argument, contends that, “unlike a\n\nblueprint that merely instructs a user how to do something, software\nactually causes infringing conduct to occur.” Post, at 3 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting). We have emphasized, however, that Windows can “caus[e]\ninfringing conduct to occur”—i.e., function as part of AT&T’s speech-\nprocessing computer—only when expressed as a computer-readable\ncopy. Abstracted from a usable copy, Windows code is intangible,\nuncombinable information, more like notes of music in the head of a\ncomposer than “a roller that causes a player piano to produce sound.”\nIbid.\n12               MICROSOFT CORP. v. AT&T CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ngress, of course, might have included within §271(f)’s\ncompass, for example, not only combinable “components”\nof a patented invention, but also “information, instruc\ntions, or tools from which those components readily may\nbe generated.” It did not. In sum, a copy of Windows, not\nWindows in the abstract, qualifies as a “component” under\n§271(f).13\n                              C\n   The next question, has Microsoft “supplie[d] . . . from\nthe United States” components of the computers here\ninvolved? Under a conventional reading of §271(f)’s text,\nthe answer would be “No,” for the foreign-made copies of\nWindows actually installed on the computers were “sup\nplie[d]” from places outside the United States. The Fed\neral Circuit majority concluded, however, that “for soft\nware ‘components,’ the act of copying is subsumed in the\nact of ‘supplying.’ ” 414 F. 3d, at 1370. A master sent\nabroad, the majority observed, differs not at all from the\nexact copies, easily, inexpensively, and swiftly generated\nfrom the master; hence “sending a single copy abroad with\nthe intent that it be replicated invokes §271(f) liability for\nth[e] foreign-made copies.” Ibid.; cf. post, at 2 (STEVENS,\nJ., dissenting) (“[A] master disk is the functional equiva\nlent of a warehouse of components . . . that Microsoft fully\nexpects to be incorporated into foreign-manufactured\ncomputers.”).\n   Judge Rader, dissenting, noted that “supplying” is ordi\nnarily understood to mean an activity separate and dis\n\n——————\n   13 We need not address whether software in the abstract, or any other\n\nintangible, can ever be a component under §271(f). If an intangible\nmethod or process, for instance, qualifies as a “patented invention”\nunder §271(f) (a question as to which we express no opinion), the\ncombinable components of that invention might be intangible as well.\nThe invention before us, however, AT&T’s speech-processing computer,\nis a tangible thing.\n                      Cite as: 550 U.

As a matter of logic, one cannot supply one hun\ndred components of a patented invention without first\nmaking one hundred copies of the component . . . .”). He\nfurther observed: “The only true difference between mak\ning and supplying software components and physical\ncomponents [of other patented inventions] is that copies of\nsoftware components are easier to make and transport.”\nId., at 1374. But nothing in §271(f)’s text, Judge Rader\nmaintained, renders ease of copying a relevant, no less\ndecisive, factor in triggering liability for infringement. See\nibid. We agree.\n   Section 271(f) prohibits the supply of components “from\nthe United States . . . in such manner as to actively induce\nthe combination of such components.” §271(f)(1) (emphasis\nadded). Under this formulation, the very components\nsupplied from the United States, and not copies thereof,\ntrigger §271(f) liability when combined abroad to form the\npatented invention at issue. Here, as we have repeatedly\nnoted, see supra, at 1–2, 5–6, the copies of Windows actu\nally installed on the foreign computers were not them\nselves supplied from the United States.14 Indeed, those\ncopies did not exist until they were generated by third\nparties outside the United States.15 Copying software\n——————\n  14 In a footnote, Microsoft suggests that even a disk shipped from the\n\nUnited States, and used to install Windows directly on a foreign com\nputer, would not give rise to liability under §271(f) if the disk were\nremoved after installation. See Brief for Petitioner 37, n. 11; cf. post, at\n2–4 (ALITO, J., concurring). We need not and do not reach that issue\nhere.\n  15 The dissent analogizes Microsoft’s supply of master versions of\n14               MICROSOFT CORP. v. AT&T CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nabroad, all might agree, is indeed easy and inexpensive.\nBut the same could be said of other items: “Keys or ma\nchine parts might be copied from a master; chemical or\nbiological substances might be created by reproduction;\nand paper products might be made by electronic copying\nand printing.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n24. See also supra, at 11–12 (rejecting argument similarly\nbased on ease of copying in construing “component”).\nSection 271(f) contains no instruction to gauge when du\nplication is easy and cheap enough to deem a copy in fact\nmade abroad nevertheless “supplie[d] . . . from the United\nStates.” The absence of anything addressing copying in\nthe statutory text weighs against a judicial determination\nthat replication abroad of a master dispatched from the\nUnited States “supplies” the foreign-made copies from the\nUnited States within the intendment of §271(f).16\n——————\nWindows abroad to “the export of an inventory of . . . knives to be\nwarehoused until used to complete the assembly of an infringing\nmachine.” Post, at 2. But as we have underscored, foreign-made copies\nof Windows, not the masters Microsoft dispatched from the United\nStates, were installed on the computers here involved. A more apt\nanalogy, therefore, would be the export of knives for copying abroad,\nwith the foreign-made copies “warehoused until used to complete the\nassembly of an infringing machine.” Ibid. Without stretching §271(f)\nbeyond the text Congress composed, a copy made entirely abroad does\nnot fit the description “supplie[d] . . . from the United States.”\n   16 Our analysis, while focusing on §271(f)(1), is equally applicable to\n\n§271(f)(2). But cf. post, at 1 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (asserting “para\ngraph (2) . . . best supports AT&T’s position here”). While the two\nparagraphs differ, among other things, on the quantity of components\nthat must be “supplie[d] . . . from the United States” for liability to\nattach, see infra, at 18, n. 18, that distinction does not affect our\nanalysis. Paragraph (2), like (1), covers only a “component” amenable\nto “combination.” §271(f)(2); see supra, at 9–12 (explaining why Win\ndows in the abstract is not a combinable component). Paragraph (2),\nlike (1), encompasses only the “[s]uppl[y] . . . from the United States” of\n“such [a] component” as will itself “be combined outside of the United\nStates.” §271(f)(2); see supra, at 12–13 and this page (observing that\nforeign-made copies of Windows installed on computers abroad were\n                    Cite as: 550 U.

See\nsupra, at 2, 4. The presumption that United States law\ngoverns domestically but does not rule the world applies\nwith particular force in patent law. The traditional un\nderstanding that our patent law “operate[s] only domesti\ncally and d[oes] not extend to foreign activities,” Fisch &\nAllen, supra, at 559, is embedded in the Patent Act itself,\nwhich provides that a patent confers exclusive rights in an\ninvention within the United States. 35 U. S. C. §154(a)(1)\n(patentee’s rights over invention apply to manufacture,\nuse, or sale “throughout the United States” and to impor\ntation “into the United States”). See Deepsouth, 406 U. S.,\nat 531 (“Our patent system makes no claim to extraterri\ntorial effect”; our legislation “d[oes] not, and [was] not\nintended to, operate beyond the limits of the United\nStates, and we correspondingly reject the claims of others\nto such control over our markets.” (quoting Brown, 19\nHow., at 195)).\n  As a principle of general application, moreover, we have\nstated that courts should “assume that legislators take\naccount of the legitimate sovereign interests of other\nnations when they write American laws.” F. Hoffmann-La\nRoche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542 U. S. 155, 164 (2004);\nsee EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248\n(1991). Thus, the United States accurately conveyed in\nthis case: “Foreign conduct is [generally] the domain of\nforeign law,” and in the area here involved, in particular,\nforeign law “may embody different policy judgments about\nthe relative rights of inventors, competitors, and the pub\n—————— \n\nnot “supplie[d] . . . from the United States”). It is thus unsurprising\n\nthat AT&T does not join the dissent in suggesting that the outcome \n\nmight turn on whether we view the case under paragraph (1) or (2). \n\n16             MICROSOFT CORP. v. AT&T CORP.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nlic in patented inventions.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 28. Applied to this case, the presumption\ntugs strongly against construction of §271(f) to encompass\nas a “component” not only a physical copy of software, but\nalso software’s intangible code, and to render “supplie[d]\n. . . from the United States” not only exported copies of\nsoftware, but also duplicates made abroad.\n    AT&T argues that the presumption is inapplicable\nbecause Congress enacted §271(f) specifically to extend the\nreach of United States patent law to cover certain activity\nabroad. But as this Court has explained, “the presump\ntion is not defeated . . . just because [a statute] specifically\naddresses [an] issue of extraterritorial application,” Smith\nv. United States, 507 U. S. 197, 204 (1993); it remains\ninstructive in determining the extent of the statutory\nexception. See Empagran, 542 U. S., at 161–162, 164–165;\nSmith, 507 U. S., at 204.\n    AT&T alternately contends that the presumption holds\nno sway here given that §271(f), by its terms, applies only\nto domestic conduct, i.e., to the supply of a patented inven\ntion’s components “from the United States.” §271(f)(1).\nAT&T’s reading, however, “converts a single act of supply\nfrom the United States into a springboard for liability\neach time a copy of the software is subsequently made\n[abroad] and combined with computer hardware [abroad]\nfor sale [abroad.]” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 29; see 414 F. 3d, at 1373, 1375 (Rader, J., dissent\ning). In short, foreign law alone, not United States law,\ncurrently governs the manufacture and sale of components\nof patented inventions in foreign countries. If AT&T\ndesires to prevent copying in foreign countries, its remedy\ntoday lies in obtaining and enforcing foreign patents. See\nDeepsouth, 406 U.

Liability\nfor infringing a United States patent could be avoided, as\nMicrosoft’s practice shows, by an easily arranged circum\nvention: Instead of making installation copies of software\nin the United States, the copies can be made abroad,\nswiftly and at small cost, by generating them from a mas\nter supplied from the United States. The Federal Circuit\nmajority found AT&T’s plea compelling:\n     “Were we to hold that Microsoft’s supply by exporta\n     tion of the master versions of the Windows® soft\n     ware—specifically for the purpose of foreign replica\n     tion—avoids infringement, we would be subverting\n     the remedial nature of §271(f), permitting a technical\n     avoidance of the statute by ignoring the advances in\n     a field of technology—and its associated industry\n     practices—that developed after the enactment of\n     §271(f). . . . Section §271(f), if it is to remain effective,\n     must therefore be interpreted in a manner that is ap\n     propriate to the nature of the technology at issue.”\n     414 F. 3d, at 1371.\nWhile the majority’s concern is understandable, we are not\npersuaded that dynamic judicial interpretation of §271(f)\nis in order. The “loophole,” in our judgment, is properly\nleft for Congress to consider, and to close if it finds such\naction warranted.\n   There is no dispute, we note again, that §271(f) is inap\nplicable to the export of design tools—blueprints, schemat\n——————\n1285 (CA Fed.), p. 1477.

See supra, at 10–12. We have no license to\nattribute to Congress an unstated intention to place the\ninformation Microsoft dispatched from the United States\nin a separate category.\n   Section 271(f) was a direct response to a gap in our\npatent law revealed by this Court’s Deepsouth decision.\nSee supra, at 4, and n. 3. The facts of that case were\nundeniably at the fore when §271(f) was in the congres\nsional hopper. In Deepsouth, the items exported were kits\ncontaining all the physical, readily assemblable parts of a\nshrimp deveining machine (not an intangible set of in\nstructions), and those parts themselves (not foreign-made\ncopies of them) would be combined abroad by foreign\nbuyers. Having attended to the gap made evident in\nDeepsouth, Congress did not address other arguable gaps:\nSection 271(f) does not identify as an infringing act con\nduct in the United States that facilitates making a compo\nnent of a patented invention outside the United States;\nnor does the provision check “suppl[ying] . . . from the\nUnited States” information, instructions, or other materi\nals needed to make copies abroad.18 Given that Congress\ndid not home in on the loophole AT&T describes, and in\nview of the expanded extraterritorial thrust AT&T’s read\ning of §271(f) entails, our precedent leads us to leave in\nCongress’ court the patent-protective determination AT&T\n——————\n  18 Section 271(f)’s text does, in one respect, reach past the facts of\nDeepsouth. While Deepsouth exported kits containing all the parts of\nits deveining machines, §271(f)(1) applies to the supply abroad of “all or\na substantial portion of” a patented invention’s components. And\n§271(f)(2) applies to the export of even a single component if it is\n“especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not\na staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial\nnoninfringing use.”\n                  Cite as: 550 U.

Ante, at 9–11. This is because the\nword “component,” when concerning a physical device, is\nmost naturally read to mean a physical part of the device.\nSee Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 466\n(1976) (component is a “constituent part: INGREDIENT”);\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language 301\n\n——————\n  * In a sense, the whole process is akin to an author living prior to the\nexistence of the printing press, who created a story in his mind, wrote a\nmanuscript, and sent it to a scrivener, who in turn copied the story by\nhand into a blank book.\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

Webster’s, supra, at 452 (combine means “to\njoin in physical or chemical union”; “to become one”; “to\nunite into a chemical compound”); Random House, supra,\nat 293 (combine means “to bring or join into a close union\nor whole”). For these reasons, I agree with the Court that\na set of instructions on how to build an infringing device,\nor even a template of the device, does not qualify as a\ncomponent. Ante, at 9–10.\n                             B\n  As the parties agree, an inventor can patent a machine\nthat carries out a certain process, and a computer may\nconstitute such a machine when it executes commands—\ngiven to it by code—that allow it to carry out that process.\nSuch a computer would not become an infringing device\nuntil enough of the code is installed on the computer to\nallow it to execute the process in question. The computer\nwould not be an infringing device prior to the installation,\nor even during the installation. And the computer re\nmains an infringing device after the installation process\nbecause, even though the original installation device (such\nas a CD-ROM) has been removed from the computer, the\ncode remains on the hard drive.\n                           III\n   Here, Windows software originating in the United\nStates was sent abroad, whether on a master disk or by\nmeans of an electronic transmission, and eventually cop\nied onto the hard drives of the foreign-made computers.\nOnce the copying process was completed, the Windows\nprogram was recorded in a physical form, i.e., in magnetic\nfields on the computers’ hard drives. See Brief for Re\nspondent 5. The physical form of the Windows program on\n4             MICROSOFT CORP. v.

See Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 2 (citing White, How\nComputers Work, at 144–145, 172–173). There is nothing\nin the record to suggest that any physical part of the disk\nbecame a physical part of the foreign-made computer, and\nsuch an occurrence would be contrary to the general work\nings of computers.\n  Because no physical object originating in the United\nStates was combined with these computers, there was no\nviolation of §271(f). Accordingly, it is irrelevant that the\nWindows software was not copied onto the foreign-made\ncomputers directly from the master disk or from an elec\ntronic transmission that originated in the United States.\nTo be sure, if these computers could not run Windows\nwithout inserting and keeping a CD-ROM in the appropri\nate drive, then the CD-ROMs might be components of the\ncomputer. But that is not the case here.\n                        *    *    *\n  Because the physical incarnation of code on the Win\ndows CD-ROM supplied from the United States is not a\n“component” of an infringing device under §271(f), it logi\ncally follows that a copy of such a CD-ROM also is not a\ncomponent. For this reason, I join the Court’s opinion,\nexcept for footnote 14.\n                     Cite as: 550 U.

Strong policy considerations, buttressed by the\npresumption against the application of domestic patent\nlaw in foreign markets, support Microsoft Corporation’s\nposition. I am, however, persuaded that an affirmance\nof the Court of Appeals’ judgment is more faithful to\nthe intent of the Congress that enacted §271(f) than a\nreversal.\n  The provision was a response to our decision in Deep-\nsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U. S. 518 (1972),\nholding that a patent on a shrimp deveining machine had\nnot been infringed by the export of components for assem\nbly abroad. Paragraph (1) of §271(f) would have been\nsufficient on its own to overrule Deepsouth,* but it is\nparagraph (2) that best supports AT&T’s position here. It\n——————\n  * “Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or\nfrom the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of\na patented invention, where such components are uncombined in whole\nor in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such\ncomponents outside of the United States in a manner that would\ninfringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United\nStates, shall be liable as an infringer.” 35 U. S. C. §271(f)(1).\n2            MICROSOFT CORP. v. AT&T CORP.\n\n                   STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nprovides:\n    “Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be\n    supplied in or from the United States any component\n    of a patented invention that is especially made or es\n    pecially adapted for use in the invention and not a\n    staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for\n    substantial noninfringing use, where such component\n    is uncombined in whole or in part, knowing that such\n    component is so made or adapted and intending that\n    such component will be combined outside of the\n    United States in a manner that would infringe the\n    patent if such combination occurred within the United\n    States, shall be liable as an infringer.” §271(f)(2).\nUnder this provision, the export of a specially designed\nknife that has no use other than as a part of a patented\ndeveining machine would constitute infringement. It\nfollows that §271(f)(2) would cover the export of an inven\ntory of such knives to be warehoused until used to com\nplete the assembly of an infringing machine.\n   The relevant component in this case is not a physical\nitem like a knife. Both Microsoft and the Court think that\nmeans it cannot be a “component.” See ante, at 10. But if\na disk with software inscribed on it is a “component,” I\nfind it difficult to understand why the most important\ningredient of that component is not also a component.\nIndeed, the master disk is the functional equivalent of a\nwarehouse of components—components that Microsoft\nfully expects to be incorporated into foreign-manufactured\ncomputers. Put somewhat differently: On the Court’s\nview, Microsoft could be liable under §271(f) only if it\nsends individual copies of its software directly from the\nUnited States with the intent that each copy would be\nincorporated into a separate infringing computer. But it\nseems to me that an indirect transmission via a master\ndisk warehouse is likewise covered by §271(f).\n                  Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)            3\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   I disagree with the Court’s suggestion that because\nsoftware is analogous to an abstract set of instructions, it\ncannot be regarded as a “component” within the meaning\nof §271(f). See ante, at 9–10. Whether attached or de\ntached from any medium, software plainly satisfies the\ndictionary definition of that word. See ante, at 9, n. 11\n(observing that “ ‘[c]omponent’ is commonly defined as ‘a\nconstituent part,’ ‘element,’ or ‘ingredient’ ”). And unlike a\nblueprint that merely instructs a user how to do some\nthing, software actually causes infringing conduct to occur.\nIt is more like a roller that causes a player piano to pro\nduce sound than sheet music that tells a pianist what to\ndo. Moreover, it is surely not “a staple article or commod\nity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use”\nas that term is used in §271(f)(2). On the contrary, its sole\nintended use is an infringing use.\n   I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145735/", "sha1": "bf4e71633cf163c85fdecc1d228d64180e0a3ce3", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2006-040", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:06:59"}
