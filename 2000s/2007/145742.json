Eldred, Austin, Texas, for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Jalil Abdul-Kabir, formerly known as Ted Calvin Cole,<sup>[1]</sup> contends that there is a reasonable likelihood that the trial judge's instructions to the Texas jury that sentenced him to death prevented jurors from giving meaningful consideration to constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence. He further contends that the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) denying his application for postconviction relief on November 24, 1999, misapplied the law as clearly established by earlier decisions of this Court, thereby warranting relief under the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We agree with both contentions. Although the relevant state-court judgment for purposes of our review under AEDPA is that adjudicating the merits of Cole's state habeas application, in which these claims were properly raised, we are persuaded that the same result would be dictated by those cases decided before the state trial court entered its judgment affirming Cole's death sentence on September 26, 1990. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In December 1987, Cole, his stepbrother Michael Hickey, and Michael's wife, Kelly, decided to rob and kill Kelly's grandfather, Raymond Richardson, to obtain some cash. Two days later they did so. Cole strangled Richardson with a dog leash; the group then searched the house and found $20 that they used to purchase beer and food. The next day, Michael and Kelly surrendered to the police and confessed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1660</span> The police then arrested Cole who also confessed.</p>\n<p>Cole was tried by a jury and convicted of capital murder. After a sentencing hearing, the jury was asked to answer two special issues:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Was the conduct of the defendant, TED CALVIN COLE, that caused the death of the deceased, RAYMOND C. RICHARDSON, committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Is there a probability that the defendant, TED CALVIN COLE, would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society?\" App. 127-128.<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>The trial judge instructed the jury to take into consideration evidence presented at the guilt phase as well as the sentencing phase of the trial but made no reference to mitigating evidence. Under the provisions of the Texas criminal code, the jury's affirmative answers to these two special issues required the judge to impose a death sentence. See Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071 (Vernon 2006).</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, the State introduced evidence that Cole pleaded guilty to an earlier murder when he was only 16. Shortly after being released on parole, Cole pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated sexual assault on two boys and was sentenced to 15 more years in prison. As evidence of Cole's propensity for future dangerousness, the State introduced Cole's diary which, according to the State's expert psychiatrist, Dr. Richard Coons, revealed a compulsive attraction to young boys and an obsession with criminal activity. Dr. Coons described Cole as a sociopath who lacked remorse and would not profit or learn from his experiences.</p>\n<p>In response, Cole presented two categories of mitigating evidence. The first consisted of testimony from his mother and his aunt, who described his unhappy childhood. Cole's parents lived together \"off and on\" for 10 years, over the course of which they had two children, Cole, and his younger sister, Carla. App. 35. Shortly after Cole was born, his father was arrested for robbing a liquor store. Cole's father deserted the family several times, abandoning the family completely before Cole was five years old. On the last occasion that Cole saw his father, he dropped Cole off a block from where he thought Cole's mother lived, told Cole to \"go find her,\" and drove off. <i>Id.,</i> at 42. Cole had no contact with his father during the next 10 years. <i>Ibid.</i> After Cole's father left, his mother found herself unable to care for Cole and his sister and took the children to live with her parents in Oklahoma. Cole's grandparents were both alcoholics\u0097Cole's mother was herself a self-described \"drunk\"\u0097and lived miles away from other children. Eventually, because Cole's grandparents did not want their daughter or her children living with them, Cole's mother placed him in a church-run children's home, although she kept her daughter with her. Over the next five years <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1661</span> Cole's mother visited him only twice. Cole's aunt, who visited him on holidays, testified that Cole seemed incapable of expressing any emotion and that his father never visited him at all.</p>\n<p>The second category of mitigating evidence came from two expert witnesses\u0097a psychologist and the former chief mental health officer for the Texas Department of Corrections\u0097who discussed the consequences of Cole's childhood neglect and abandonment. Dr. Jarvis Wright, the psychologist, spent 8 to 10 hours interviewing Cole and administering an \"extensive battery of psychological tests.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 63. He testified that Cole had \"real problems with impulse control\" apparently resulting from \"central nervous damage\" combined with \"all the other factors of [his] background.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 69. He also testified that Cole had likely been depressed for much of his life, that he had a \"painful\" background, and that he had \"never felt loved and worthwhile in his life.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 73, 86. Providing an analogy for Cole's early development, Dr. Wright stated that \"the manufacturing process [had] botched the raw material horribly.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 73.</p>\n<p>When specifically asked about future dangerousness, Dr. Wright acknowledged that \"if Ted were released today on the street, there's a much greater probability of dangerous behavior than with the rest of us.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 74. Although he acknowledged the possibility of change or \"burn out,\" he admitted that Cole would likely pose a threat of future dangerousness until \"years from now.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Except for his prediction that Cole would change as he grew older, Dr. Wright's testimony did not contradict the State's claim that Cole was a dangerous person, but instead sought to provide an explanation for his behavior that might reduce his moral culpability.</p>\n<p>Dr. Wendell Dickerson, a psychologist who had not previously examined Cole, observed that it was difficult to predict future dangerousness, but that \"violent conduct is predominantly, overwhelmingly the province of the young\" with the risk of violence becoming rare as people grow older. <i>Id.,</i> at 95. On cross-examination, in response to a hypothetical question about a person with Cole's character and history, Dr. Dickerson acknowledged that he would be \"alarmed\" about the future conduct of such a person because \"yes, there absolutely is a probability that they would commit... future acts of violence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 113. In sum, the strength of Cole's mitigating evidence was not its potential to contest his immediate dangerousness, to which end the experts' testimony was at least as harmful as it was helpful. Instead, its strength was its tendency to prove that his violent propensities were caused by factors beyond his control\u0097 namely, neurological damage and childhood neglect and abandonment.</p>\n<p>It was these latter considerations, however, that the prosecutor discouraged jurors from taking into account when formulating their answers to the special issues. During the <i>voir dire,</i> the prosecutor advised the jurors that they had a duty to answer the special issues based on the facts, and the extent to which such facts objectively supported findings of deliberateness and future dangerousness, rather than their views about what might be an appropriate punishment for this particular defendant. For example, juror Beeson was asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[I]f a person had a bad upbringing, but looking at those special issues, you felt that they <i>[sic]</i> met the standards regarding deliberateness and being a continuing threat to society, could you still vote `yes,' even though you felt like maybe they'd <i>[sic]</i> had a rough time as a kid? If you felt that the facts brought to you by the prosecution warranted a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1662</span> `yes' answer, could you put that out of your mind and just go by the facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[T]hat would not keep you from answering `yes,' just because a person had a poor upbringing, would it?\" XI Voir Dire Statement of Facts filed in No. CR88-0043-A (Dist. Ct. Tom Green Cty., Tex., 51st Jud. Dist.), p. 1588.</blockquote>\n<p>The prosecutor began his final closing argument with a reminder to the jury that during the <i>voir dire</i> they had \"promised the State that, if it met its burden of proof,\" they would answer \"yes\" to both special issues. App. 145. The trial judge refused to give any of several instructions requested by Cole that would have authorized a negative answer to either of the special issues on the basis of \"any evidence which, in [the jury's] opinion, mitigate[d] against the imposition of the Death Penalty, including any aspect of the Defendant's character or record.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 115; see also <i>id.,</i> at 117-124. Ultimately, the jurors answered both issues in the affirmative and Cole was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p>On direct appeal, the sole issue raised by Cole was that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's verdict. The CCA rejected Cole's claim and affirmed the judgment of the trial court on September 26, 1990.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>On March 2, 1992, the lawyer who then represented Cole filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the Texas trial court, alleging 21 claims of error.<sup>[3]</sup> Counsel later withdrew, and after delays caused in part by a letter from Cole to the trial judge stating that he wished to withdraw his \"appeal,\" the judge ultimately \"had petitioner bench warranted\" to a hearing on September 4, 1998. <i>Id.,</i> at 152-153. During that hearing, Cole advised the court that he wished to proceed with his habeas proceedings and to have the CCA appoint counsel to represent him. Without counsel having been appointed to represent Cole, and without conducting an evidentiary hearing, the trial court entered its findings and conclusions recommending denial of the application.</p>\n<p>Three of Cole's 21 claims related to the jury's inability to consider mitigating evidence. The trial judge rejected the first\u0097 \"that his mitigating evidence was not able to be properly considered and given effect by the jury under the special issues,\" <i>id.,</i> at 157\u0097because he concluded that the record, and \"especially\" the testimony of the two expert witnesses, \"provide[d] a basis for the jury to sufficiently consider the mitigating evidence offered by petitioner,\"<sup>[4]</sup><i>id.,</i> at 161. With respect to Cole's second claim, the judge agreed that appellate counsel had been ineffective for failing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1663</span> to assign error based on \"the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on mitigating evidence as contemplated by the <i>Pendry [sic]</i> decision.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 166. He nevertheless found that the result on appeal would have been the same had the point been raised. <i>Ibid.</i> On the third claim relating to mitigating evidence, the judge rejected Cole's argument that the trial court's failure to specifically instruct the jury to consider mitigating evidence and offer a definition of \"mitigating\" was error. <i>Id.,</i> at 173.</p>\n<p>Over the dissent of two members of the court, and after adopting the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law with only minor changes, the CCA denied Cole's application for state collateral relief. <i>Ex parte Cole,</i> No. 41,673-01 (Nov. 24, 1999) <i>(per curiam),</i> App. 178-179. We consolidated this case with <i>Brewer v. Quarterman,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1706, 167 L.Ed.2d 622, 2007 WL 1201609, and granted certiorari, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 432, 166 L.Ed.2d 307 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>After the Federal District Court granted Cole's motion for the appointment of counsel, he filed a timely petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. His principal claim then, as it is now, was that the sentencing jury \"was unable to consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence in his case,\" in violation of the Constitution. <i>Cole v. Johnson,</i> Civ. Action No. 6:00-CV-014-C (ND Tex., Mar. 6, 2001), p. 5, App. 184.</p>\n<p>In its opinion denying relief, the District Court began by summarizing Cole's mitigating evidence, highlighting his \"destructive family background.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The court then correctly described our decision in <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S. 302, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256, in these words:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In <i>[Penry]</i> the Supreme Court found that when the defendant places mitigating evidence before the jury, Texas juries must be given instructions which allow the jury to give effect to that mitigating evidence and to express its reasoned moral response to that evidence in determining whether to impose the death penalty.\"<sup>[5]</sup> Civ. Action No. 6:00-CV-014-C, at 8-9, App. 188.</blockquote>\n<p>The court next noted that the Fifth Circuit had formulated its own analysis for evaluating <i>Penry</i> claims. Under that analysis, for mitigating evidence to be constitutionally relevant, it \"must show (1) a <i>uniquely severe permanent handicap</i> with which the defendant is burdened through no fault of his own, ... and (2) that the <i>criminal act was attributable to this severe permanent condition.</i>\" Civ. Action No. 6:00-CV-014-C, at 9, App. 189 (quoting <i>Davis v. Scott,</i> 51 F.3d 457, 460-461 (C.A.5 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added)). Ultimately, Cole's inability to show a \"nexus\" between his troubled family background and his commission of capital murder doomed his <i>Penry</i> claim. Civ. Action No. 6:00-CV-014-C, at 13, App. 193.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals denied Cole's application for a certificate of appealability (COA), holding that \"reasonable jurists would not debate the district court's conclusion that Cole's evidence was not constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence.\" <i>Cole v. Dretke,</i> 418 F.3d 494, 498 (C.A.5 2005). Shortly thereafter, however, we held that the Fifth Circuit's \"screening <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1664</span> test\" for determining the \"`constitutional relevance'\" of mitigating evidence had \"no foundation in the decisions of this Court.\" <i>Tennard v. Dretke,</i> 542 U.S. 274, 284, 124 S.Ct. 2562, 159 L.Ed.2d 384 (2004). Accordingly, we vacated its order denying a COA in this case and remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the Court of Appeals reviewed Cole's <i>Penry</i> claim on the merits and affirmed the District Court's judgment denying the writ.</p>\n<p>Focusing primarily on the testimony of petitioner's two experts rather than that of his mother and his aunt, the Court of Appeals reviewed our recent decisions and concluded \"that the Texas special issues allowed the jury to give `full consideration and full effect' to the mitigating evidence that Cole presented at the punishment phase of his trial.\"<sup>[6]</sup> 418 F.3d, at 511. With two judges dissenting, the court denied the petition for rehearing en banc.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Because Cole filed his federal habeas petition after the effective date of AEDPA, the provisions of that Act govern the scope of our review. We must therefore ask whether the CCA's adjudication of Cole's claim on the merits \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). We conclude that it did.</p>\n<p>A careful review of our jurisprudence in this area makes clear that well before our decision in <i>Penry I,</i> our cases had firmly established that sentencing juries must be able to give meaningful consideration and effect to all mitigating evidence that might provide a basis for refusing to impose the death penalty on a particular individual, notwithstanding the severity of his crime or his potential to commit similar offenses in the future. Three of the five cases decided on the same day in 1976\u0097 <i>Woodson v. North Carolina,</i> 428 U.S. 280, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976), <i>Proffitt v. Florida,</i> 428 U.S. 242, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 49 L.Ed.2d 913 (1976), and <i>Jurek v. Texas,</i> 428 U.S. 262, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976)\u0097identified the background principles we would apply in later cases to evaluate specific rules inhibiting the jury's ability to give meaningful effect to such mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p>In <i>Woodson v. North Carolina</i><i>,</i> we invalidated a statute that made death the mandatory sentence for all persons convicted of first-degree murder. One of the statute's constitutional shortcomings was its \"failure to allow the particularized consideration of relevant aspects of the character and record of each convicted defendant before the imposition upon him of a sentence of death.\" 428 U.S., at 303, 96 S.Ct. 2978 (plurality opinion).<sup>[8]</sup> In <i>Proffitt v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1665</span> <i>Florida</i> and <i>Jurek v. Texas</i><i>,</i> the joint opinions rejected facial challenges to the sentencing statutes enacted in Florida and Texas, assuming in both cases that provisions allowing for the unrestricted admissibility of mitigating evidence would ensure that a sentencing jury had adequate guidance in performing its sentencing function.<sup>[9]</sup> As a majority of the Court later acknowledged, our holding in <i>Jurek</i> did not preclude the possibility that the Texas sentencing statute might be found unconstitutional <i>as applied</i> in a particular case. See n. 15, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>Two years later, in <i>Lockett v. Ohio,</i> 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), a plurality concluded \"that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, not be precluded from considering, <i>as a mitigating factor,</i> any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954 (footnote omitted). Because Ohio's death penalty statute was inconsistent with this principle, it was declared unconstitutional. The plurality noted the possible tension between a holding that the Ohio statute was invalid and our decisions in <i>Proffitt</i> and <i>Jurek</i> upholding the Florida and Texas statutes, but distinguished those cases because neither statute \"clearly operated at that time to prevent the sentencer from considering any aspect of the defendant's character and record or any circumstances of his offense as an independently mitigating factor.\" 438 U.S., at 607, 98 S.Ct. 2954.</p>\n<p>While Chief Justice Burger's opinion in <i>Lockett</i> was joined by only three other Justices, the rule it announced was endorsed and broadened in our subsequent decisions in <i>Eddings v. Oklahoma,</i> 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), and <i>Skipper v. South Carolina,</i> 476 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986). In those cases, we emphasized the severity of imposing a death sentence and that \"the sentencer in capital cases must be permitted to consider <i>any</i> relevant mitigating factor.\"<sup>[10]</sup><i>Eddings,</i> 455 U.S., at 112, 102 S.Ct. 869 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>In the wake of our decision in <i>Lockett,</i> Ohio amended its capital sentencing statute to give effect to <i>Lockett's</i> holding.<sup>[11]</sup> Neither Florida nor Texas did so, however, until after our unanimous decision in <i>Hitchcock v. Dugger,</i> 481 U.S. 393, 107 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1666</span> S.Ct. 1821, 95 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987), unequivocally confirmed the settled quality of the <i>Lockett</i> rule. As Justice SCALIA's opinion for the Court explained, the defendant had introduced some rather atypical mitigating evidence that was not expressly authorized by the Florida statute:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In the sentencing phase of this case, petitioner's counsel introduced before the advisory jury evidence that as a child petitioner had the habit of inhaling gasoline fumes from automobile gas tanks; that he had once passed out after doing so; that thereafter his mind tended to wander; that petitioner had been one of seven children in a poor family that earned its living by picking cotton; that his father had died of cancer; and that petitioner had been a fond and affectionate uncle to the children of one of his brothers.\" 481 U.S., at 397, 107 S.Ct. 1821.</blockquote>\n<p>As the opinion further explained, the Florida courts had construed the state statute to preclude consideration of mitigating factors unmentioned in the statute. Accordingly, despite our earlier decision in <i>Proffitt</i> upholding the statute against a facial challenge, it was necessary to set aside Hitchcock's death sentence. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We think it could not be clearer that the advisory jury was instructed not to consider, and the sentencing judge refused to consider, evidence of nonstatutory mitigating circumstances, and that the proceedings therefore did not comport with the requirements of <i>Skipper v. South Carolina,</i> 476 U.S. 1[, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1] (1986), <i>Eddings v. Oklahoma,</i> 455 U.S. 104[, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1] (1982), and <i>Lockett v. Ohio,</i> 438 U.S. 586[, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973] (1978) (plurality opinion). Respondent has made no attempt to argue that this error was harmless, or that it had no effect on the jury or the sentencing judge. In the absence of such a showing our cases hold that the exclusion of mitigating evidence of the sort at issue here renders the death sentence invalid. See <i>Skipper, supra</i> (evidence that defendant had adapted well to prison life); <i>Eddings, supra</i> (evidence of 16-year-old defendant's troubled family history and emotional disturbance).\" 481 U.S., at 398-399, 107 S.Ct. 1821.</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, our reference to \"exclusion\" of the evidence did not refer to its admissibility, but rather to its exclusion from meaningful consideration by the jury. Had <i>Jurek</i> and <i>Proffitt</i> truly stood for the proposition that the mere availability of relevant mitigating evidence was sufficient to satisfy the Constitution's requirements, <i>Hitchcock</i> could never have been decided as it was.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1667</span> In the year following our decision in <i>Hitchcock,</i> we made clear that sentencing under the Texas statute, like that under the Florida statute, must accord with the <i>Lockett</i> rule. In <i>Franklin v. Lynaugh,</i> 487 U.S. 164, 172, 177, 183, 108 S.Ct. 2320, 101 L.Ed.2d 155 (1988), the plurality rejected the claim that the judge's instructions did not allow the jury to give adequate weight to whatever \"`residual doubts'\" it may have had concerning the defendant's guilt, or to evidence of the petitioner's good behavior while in prison. That particular holding is unremarkable because we have never held that capital defendants have an Eighth Amendment right to present \"residual doubt\" evidence at sentencing, see <i>Oregon v. Guzek,</i> 546 U.S. 517, 523-527, 126 S.Ct. 1226, 163 L.Ed.2d 1112 (2006), and in most cases evidence of good behavior in prison is primarily, if not exclusively, relevant to the issue of future dangerousness. What makes <i>Franklin</i> significant, however, is the separate opinion of Justice O'Connor, and particularly those portions of her opinion expressing the views of five Justices, see <i>infra,</i> at 1668-1669, and n. 15. After summarizing the cases that clarified <i>Jurek's</i> holding,<sup>[13]</sup> she wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In my view, the principle underlying <i>Lockett, Eddings,</i> and <i>Hitchcock</i> is that punishment should be directly related to the personal culpability of the criminal defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`[E]vidence about the defendant's background and character is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background, or to emotional and mental problems, may be less culpable than defendants who have no such excuse .... Thus, the sentence imposed at the penalty stage should reflect a reasoned <i>moral</i> response to the defendant's background, character, and crime.' <i>California v. Brown,</i> 479 U.S. 538, 545, 107 S.Ct. 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In light of this principle it is clear that a State may not constitutionally prevent the sentencing body from giving effect to evidence relevant to the defendant's background or character or the circumstances of the offense that mitigates against the death penalty. <i>Indeed, the right to have the sentencer consider and weigh relevant mitigating evidence would be meaningless unless the sentencer was also permitted to give effect to its consideration.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1668</span> \"Under the sentencing procedure followed in this case the jury could express its views about the appropriate punishment only by answering the special verdict questions regarding the deliberateness of the murder and the defendant's future dangerousness. To the extent that the mitigating evidence introduced by petitioner was relevant to one of the special verdict questions, the jury was free to give effect to that evidence by returning a negative answer to that question. If, however, petitioner had introduced mitigating evidence about his background or character or the circumstances of the crime that was not relevant to the special verdict questions, or that had relevance to the defendant's moral culpability beyond the scope of the special verdict questions, the jury instructions would have provided the jury with no vehicle for expressing its `reasoned moral response' to that evidence.\" 487 U.S., at 183, 184-185, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court in <i>Penry I</i> endorsed the views she had expressed in <i>Franklin</i> and unquestionably governs the facts of this case.<sup>[14]</sup> Penry contended that his mitigating evidence of mental retardation and an abusive childhood provided a basis for a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death and that the jury should have been instructed that it could consider that evidence when making its sentencing decision. In response to that contention, our opinion first held that Penry was not asking us to make new law because he was relying on a rule that was \"dictated\" by earlier cases, see n. 10, <i>supra,</i> and explained why Justice O'Connor's separate opinion in <i>Franklin</i> correctly defined the relevant rule of law.<sup>[15]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1669</span> In <i>Franklin,</i> we noted, \"both the concurrence and the dissent stressed that `the right to have the sentencer consider and weigh relevant mitigating evidence would be meaningless unless the sentencer was also permitted to give effect to its consideration' in imposing sentence.\" 492 U.S., at 321, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (citing <i>Franklin,</i> 487 U.S., at 185, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 199, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (STEVENS, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p>Applying that standard, we held that neither the \"deliberateness\" nor the \"future dangerousness\" special issue provided the jury with a meaningful opportunity to give effect to Penry's mitigating evidence. With respect to the former, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In the absence of jury instructions defining `deliberately' in a way that would clearly direct the jury to consider fully Penry's mitigating evidence as it bears on his personal culpability, we cannot be sure that the jury was able to give effect to the mitigating evidence of Penry's mental retardation and history of abuse in answering the first special issue. Without such a special instruction, a juror who believed that Penry's retardation and background diminished his moral culpability and made imposition of the death penalty unwarranted would be unable to give effect to that conclusion if the juror also believed that Penry committed the crime `deliberately.' Thus, we cannot be sure that the jury's answer to the first special issue reflected a `reasoned moral response' to Penry's mitigating evidence.\" 492 U.S., at 323, 109 S.Ct. 2934.</blockquote>\n<p>With respect to the future dangerousness issue, we emphasized the fact that Penry's evidence of mental retardation was relevant only as an aggravating factor. <i>Id.,</i> at 323-324, 109 S.Ct. 2934. More broadly, we noted that the evidence of Penry's mental retardation and childhood abuse functioned as a \"two-edged sword,\" because it \"may diminish his blameworthiness for his crime even as it indicates that there is a probability that he will be dangerous in the future.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 324, 109 S.Ct. 2934. We therefore held that, in the absence of an appropriate instruction directing the \"jury to consider fully\" mitigating evidence as it bears on the extent to which a defendant is undeserving of a death sentence, \"we cannot be sure\" that it did so. <i>Id.,</i> at 323, 109 S.Ct. 2934. As our discussion of the deliberateness issue demonstrates, we did not limit our holding in <i>Penry I</i> to mitigating evidence that can only be viewed as aggravating. When the evidence proffered is double edged, or is as likely to be viewed as aggravating as it is as mitigating, the statute most obviously fails to provide for adequate consideration of such evidence.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1670</span> The former special issues (as composed at the time of both Penry's and Cole's sentencing proceedings) provided an adequate vehicle for the evaluation of mitigating evidence offered to disprove deliberateness or future dangerousness. As Judge Reavley noted in his opinion for the Court of Appeals in <i>Penry I,</i> however, they did not tell the jury as to what \"to do if it decided that Penry, because of retardation, arrested emotional development and a troubled youth, should not be executed.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 324, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>In recommending denial of Cole's application for collateral relief, the Texas trial judge did not analyze <i>Penry I</i> itself. Under the framework set forth in <i>Penry I,</i><sup>[17]</sup> the testimony of Cole's mother and aunt, as well as the portions of the expert testimony suggesting that his dangerous character may have been the result of his rough childhood and possible neurological damage, were not relevant to either of the special verdict questions, except, possibly, as evidence supporting the State's argument that Cole would be dangerous in the future. This would not satisfy the requirement of <i>Penry I,</i> however, that the evidence be permitted its mitigating force beyond the scope of the special issues. Therefore, it would have followed that those questions failed to provide the jury with a vehicle for expressing its \"reasoned moral response\" to that evidence.</p>\n<p>Instead of relying on <i>Penry I,</i> the trial judge relied on three later Texas cases and on our opinion in <i>Graham v. Collins,</i> 506 U.S. 461, 113 S.Ct. 892, 122 L.Ed.2d 260 (1993), as having held that nine different categories of mitigating evidence\u0097including a troubled family background, bipolar disorder, low IQ, substance abuse, paranoid personality disorder, and child abuse\u0097were sufficiently considered under the Texas special issues.<sup>[18]</sup> App. 159-160. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1671</span> Applying those cases, the judge defined the legal issue \"whether the mitigating evidence can be sufficiently considered\" as one that \"must be determined on a case by case basis, depending on the nature of the mitigating evidence offered and whether there exists other testimony in the record that would allow consideration to be given.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 160. As we have noted, in endorsing this formulation of the issue, neither the trial judge nor the CCA had the benefit of any input from counsel representing petitioner. See Part II, <i>supra.</i> In our view, denying relief on the basis of that formulation of the issue, while ignoring the fundamental principles established by our most relevant precedents, resulted in a decision that was both \"contrary to\" and \"involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p>The state court's primary reliance on <i>Graham,</i> to the exclusion of our other cases in this line of jurisprudence, was misguided. In <i>Graham,</i> we held that granting collateral relief to a defendant who had been sentenced to death in 1984 would require the announcement of a new rule of constitutional law in contravention of <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). In reaching that conclusion we relied heavily on the fact that in 1984 it was reasonable for judges to rely on the interpretation of <i>Jurek</i> that the plurality had espoused in <i>Franklin.</i> See 506 U.S., at 468-472, 113 S.Ct. 892; see also n. 15, <i>supra.</i> But as we have explained, in both <i>Franklin</i> and <i>Penry I,</i> a majority of the Court ultimately rejected the plurality's interpretation of <i>Jurek.</i> Neither <i>Franklin</i> nor <i>Penry I</i> was inconsistent with <i>Graham's</i> narrow holding, but they do suggest that our later decisions\u0097including <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> 509 U.S. 350, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993), in which we refused to adopt the rule that Graham sought<sup>[19]</sup>\u0097are of more relevance to Cole's case than <i>Graham.</i> The relevance of those cases lies not in their results\u0097in several instances, we concluded, after applying the relevant law, that the special issues provided for adequate consideration of the defendant's mitigating evidence<sup>[20]</sup>\u0097but in their failure to disturb the basic legal principle that continues to govern such cases: The jury must have a \"meaningful basis to consider the relevant mitigating qualities\" of the defendant's proffered evidence.<sup>[21]</sup><i>Johnson,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1672</span> 509 U.S., at 369, 113 S.Ct. 2658; see also <i>Graham,</i> 506 U.S., at 474, 113 S.Ct. 892 (explaining that Penry was entitled to additional instructions \"[b]ecause it was impossible [for the jury] to give meaningful mitigating effect to Penry's evidence by way of answering the special issues\").</p>\n<p>Before turning to those more recent cases, it is appropriate to identify the reasons why the CCA's ruling was not a reasonable application of <i>Penry I</i> itself. First, the ruling ignored the fact that even though Cole's mitigating evidence may not have been as persuasive as Penry's, it was relevant to the question of Cole's moral culpability for precisely the same reason as Penry's. Like Penry's evidence, Cole's evidence of childhood deprivation and lack of self-control did not rebut either deliberateness or future dangerousness but was intended to provide the jury with an entirely different reason for not imposing a death sentence. Second, the judge's assumption that it would be appropriate to look at \"other testimony in the record\" to determine whether the jury could give mitigating effect to the testimony of Cole's mother and aunt is neither reasonable nor supported by the <i>Penry</i> opinion. App. 160. Third, the fact that the jury could give mitigating effect to some of the experts' testimony, namely, their predictions that Cole could be expected to become less dangerous as he aged, provides no support for the conclusion that the jury understood it could give such effect to other portions of the experts' testimony or that of other witnesses. In sum, the judge ignored our entire line of cases establishing the importance of allowing juries to give meaningful effect to any mitigating evidence providing a basis for a sentence of life rather than death. His recommendation to the CCA was therefore unsupported by either the text or the reasoning in <i>Penry I.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p>The same principles originally set forth in earlier cases such as <i>Lockett</i> and <i>Eddings</i> have been articulated explicitly by our later cases, which explained that the jury must be permitted to \"consider fully\" such mitigating evidence and that such consideration \"would be meaningless\" unless the jury not only had such evidence available to it, but also was permitted to give that evidence meaningful, mitigating effect in imposing the ultimate sentence. <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S., at 321, 323, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Graham,</i> 506 U.S., at 475, 113 S.Ct. 892 (acknowledging that a \"constitutional defect\" has occurred not only when a jury is \"precluded from even considering certain types of mitigating evidence,\" but also when \"the defendant's evidence [i]s placed before the sentencer but the sentencer ha[s] no reliable means of giving mitigating effect to that evidence\").</p>\n<p>Four of our more recent cases lend support to the conclusion that the CCA's decision was unsupported by either the text or the reasoning of <i>Penry I.</i><sup>[22]</sup> In <i>Johnson v. Texas</i><i>,</i> we held that the Texas special issues allowed adequate consideration of petitioner's youth as a mitigating circumstance. Indeed, we thought it \"strain[ed] credulity to suppose that the jury would have viewed the evidence of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1673</span> petitioner's youth as outside its effective reach\" because its relevance was so obvious. 509 U.S., at 368, 113 S.Ct. 2658. There is of course a vast difference between youth\u0097a universally applicable mitigating circumstance that every juror has experienced and which necessarily is transient\u0097and the particularized childhood experiences of abuse and neglect that <i>Penry I</i> and <i>Cole</i> described\u0097which presumably most jurors have never experienced and which affect each individual in a distinct manner.</p>\n<p>Evidence of youth, moreover, has special relevance to the question of future dangerousness. A critical assumption motivating the Court's decision in <i>Johnson</i> was that juries would in fact be able to give mitigating effect to the evidence, albeit within the confines of the special issues. See 509 U.S., at 370, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (\"If any jurors believed that the transient qualities of petitioner's youth made him less culpable for the murder, there is no reasonable likelihood that those jurors would have deemed themselves foreclosed from considering that in evaluating petitioner's future dangerousness\"). Prosecutors in some subsequent cases, however, have undermined this assumption, taking pains to convince jurors that the law compels them to disregard the force of evidence offered in mitigation. Cole's prosecution is illustrative: the State made jurors \"promise\" they would look only at the questions posed by the special issues, which, according to the prosecutor, required a juror to \"put ... out of [his] mind\" Cole's mitigating evidence and \"just go by the facts.\" <i>Supra,</i> at 1662. Arguments like these are at odds with the Court's understanding in <i>Johnson</i> that juries could and would reach mitigating evidence proffered by a defendant. Nothing in <i>Johnson</i> forecloses relief in these circumstances. See 509 U.S., at 369, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (\"<i>Penry</i> remains the law and must be given a fair reading\").</p>\n<p>This conclusion derives further support from the fact that, in <i>Johnson,</i> the Court understood that the defendant's evidence of youth\u0097including testimony from his father that \"his son's actions were due in large part to his youth,\" <i>id.,</i> at 368, 113 S.Ct. 2658, and counsel's corresponding arguments that the defendant could change as he grew older\u0097was \"readily comprehended as a mitigating factor,\" <i>id.,</i> at 369, 113 S.Ct. 2658, in the context of the special issues. The evidence offered in this case, however, as well as that offered by the petitioner in <i>Brewer,</i> ___ U.S. at ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 1706, 1709-1710, and n.1, 2007 WL 1201609, is closer in nature to that offered by the defendant in <i>Penry I</i> than that at issue in <i>Johnson.</i> While the consideration of the defendant's mitigating evidence of youth in <i>Johnson</i> could easily have directed jurors towards a \"no\" answer with regard to the question of future dangerousness, a juror considering Cole's evidence of childhood neglect and abandonment and possible neurological damage or Brewer's evidence of mental illness, substance abuse, and a troubled childhood could feel compelled to provide a \"yes\" answer to the same question, finding himself without a means for giving <i>meaningful</i> effect to the mitigating qualities of such evidence.<sup>[23]</sup> In such a case, there is a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1674</span> reasonable likelihood that the special issues would preclude that juror from giving meaningful consideration to such mitigating evidence, as required by <i>Penry I.</i> See <i>Johnson,</i> 509 U.S., at 367, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (explaining that in <i>Boyde v. California,</i> 494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990), \"we held that a reviewing court must determine `whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence'\").</p>\n<p>In three later cases, we gave <i>Penry I</i> the \"fair reading\" required by <i>Johnson</i> and repudiated several Fifth Circuit precedents providing the basis for its narrow reading of that case. First, in our review of Penry's resentencing, at which the judge had supplemented the special issues with a nullification instruction, we again concluded that the jury had not been provided with an adequate \"vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response\" to his mitigating evidence. <i>Penry v. Johnson,</i> 532 U.S. 782, 797, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001) <i>(Penry II)</i><i>.</i> Indeed, given that the resentencing occurred after the enactment of AEDPA, we concluded (contrary to the views of the Fifth Circuit, which had denied Penry a COA) that the CCA's judgment affirming the death sentence was objectively unreasonable. <i>Id.,</i> at 803-804, 121 S.Ct. 1910. Second, and as we have already noted, in <i>Tennard</i> we held that the Fifth Circuit's test for identifying relevant mitigating evidence was incorrect. 542 U.S., at 284, 124 S.Ct. 2562. Most recently, in <i>Smith v. Texas,</i> 543 U.S. 37, 125 S.Ct. 400, 160 L.Ed.2d 303 (2004) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> and again contrary to the views of the Fifth Circuit, we held that a nullification instruction that was different from the one used in Penry's second sentencing hearing did not foreclose the defendant's claim that the special issues had precluded the jury from \"expressing a `reasoned moral response' to <i>all</i> of the evidence relevant to the defendant's culpability.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 46, 125 S.Ct. 400.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII</h2>\n<p>Our line of cases in this area has long recognized that before a jury can undertake the grave task of imposing a death sentence, it must be allowed to consider a defendant's moral culpability and decide whether death is an appropriate punishment for that individual in light of his personal history and characteristics and the circumstances of the offense.<sup>[24]</sup> As Chief Justice Burger wrote in <i>Lockett:</i></p>\n<blockquote>\"There is no perfect procedure for deciding in which cases governmental authority should be used to impose death. But a statute that prevents the sentencer in all capital cases from giving independent mitigating weight to aspects of the defendant's character and record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty. When the choice is between life and death, that risk is unacceptable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1675</span> and incompatible with the commands of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" 438 U.S., at 605, 98 S.Ct. 2954.</blockquote>\n<p>Our cases following <i>Lockett</i> have made clear that when the jury is not permitted to give meaningful effect or a \"reasoned moral response\" to a defendant's mitigating evidence\u0097because it is forbidden from doing so by statute or a judicial interpretation of a statute\u0097the sentencing process is fatally flawed.<sup>[25]</sup> For that reason, our post-<i>Penry</i> cases are fully consistent with our conclusion that the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case must be reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice SCALIA, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>A jury imposed a sentence of death in each of these cases, despite hearing mitigating evidence from the defendants about their troubled backgrounds. The convictions and sentences were upheld on direct review. On state collateral review, each defendant claimed that the jury instructions did not allow sufficient consideration of the mitigating evidence. This Court had considered similar challenges to the <i>same</i> instructions no fewer than five times in the years before the state habeas courts considered the challenges at issue here. See <i>Jurek v. Texas,</i> 428 U.S. 262, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976); <i>Franklin v. Lynaugh,</i> 487 U.S. 164, 108 S.Ct. 2320, 101 L.Ed.2d 155 (1988); <i>Penry v. Lynaugh,</i> 492 U.S. 302, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989) (<i>Penry I</i>); <i>Graham v. Collins,</i> 506 U.S. 461, 113 S.Ct. 892, 122 L.Ed.2d 260 (1993); <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> 509 U.S. 350, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993). Four of the cases rejected the defendant's challenge. Only one\u0097<i>Penry I</i>\u0097upheld it. The guidance the Court gave in these five cases on whether the jury instructions at issue allowed sufficient consideration of mitigating evidence amounted to\u0097it depends. It depends on the particular characteristics of the evidence in a specific case. The state courts here rejected the claim as applied to the particular mitigating evidence in these cases, and the defendants sought federal habeas review.</p>\n<p>Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), however, a state-court decision can be set aside on federal habeas review only if it is \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1676</span> \u00a7 2254(d)(1). When this Court considers similar challenges to the same jury instructions five separate times, it usually is not because the applicable legal rules are \"clearly established.\" The Court today nonetheless picks from the five precedents the <i>one</i> that ruled in favor of the defendant\u0097 <i>Penry I</i>\u0097and anoints <i>that</i> case as the one embodying \"clearly established Federal law.\" In doing so the Court fails to give any meaningful weight to the two pertinent precedents <i>subsequent</i> to <i>Penry I\u0097Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i>\u0097even though those cases adopted a more \"limited view\" of <i>Penry I</i> than the Court embraces today. <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 365, 113 S.Ct. 2658. Indeed, the reading of <i>Penry I</i> in <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i> prompted every one of the remaining Justices who had been in the majority in <i>Penry I</i> on the pertinent question to dissent in <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson,</i> on the ground that the Court was failing to adhere to <i>Penry I.</i></p>\n<p>I suppose the Court today is free to ignore the import of <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i> on the question of what <i>Penry I</i> means, but in 1999 or 2001, respectively\u0097when petitioners were denied collateral relief\u0097 the state courts did not have that luxury. They should not be faulted today for concluding\u0097exactly as the <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i> dissenters did\u0097that the Court had cut back significantly on <i>Penry I.</i></p>\n<p>We give ourselves far too much credit in claiming that our sharply divided, ebbing and flowing decisions in this area gave rise to \"clearly established\" federal law. If the law were indeed clearly established by our decisions \"as of the time of the relevant state-court decision,\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), it should not take the Court more than a dozen pages of close analysis of plurality, concurring, and even dissenting opinions to explain what that \"clearly established\" law was. <i>Ante,</i> at 1664-1672. When the state courts considered these cases, our precedents did not provide them with \"clearly established\" law, but instead a dog's breakfast of divided, conflicting, and ever-changing analyses. That is how the Justices on <i>this</i> Court viewed the matter, as they shifted from being in the majority, plurality, concurrence, or dissent from case to case, repeatedly lamenting the failure of their colleagues to follow a consistent path. Whatever the law may be today, the Court's ruling that `twas always so\u0097and that state courts were \"objectively unreasonable\" not to know it, <i>Williams, supra,</i> at 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495\u0097is utterly revisionist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1987, Jalil Abdul-Kabir\u0097referred to by his given name, Ted Calvin Cole, throughout this opinion, <i>ante,</i> at 1659, n. 1\u0097was convicted of capital murder after he confessed to strangling 66-year-old Raymond Richardson with a dog leash to steal $20 from him. Among the 21 claims Cole raised on state collateral review was a challenge under <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S. 302, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256, to the application of Texas's special issue jury instructions. In evaluating Cole's challenge, the state habeas trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The issue is whether the sentencing jury had been unable to give effect to [Cole's] mitigating evidence within the confines of the statutory `special issues.' While [<i>Penry I</i>] held that evidence of a defendant's mental retardation and abused childhood could not be given mitigating effect by a jury within the framework of the special issues, the cases that followed such as <i>Graham v. Collins,</i> [506 U.S. 461, 113 S.Ct. 892, 122 L.Ed.2d 260] (1993), <i>Garcia v. State,</i> 919 S.W.2d 370 (1996), <i>Mines v. State,</i> 888 S.W.2d 816 (1994), and <i>Zimmerman v. State,</i> 881 S.W.2d 360 (1994) held that the mitigating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1677</span> evidence of alcoholism, drug abuse, bad family background, bipolar disorder, low I.Q., substance abuse, head injury, paranoid personality disorder and child abuse were sufficiently considered under the special issues. The issue of whether the mitigating evidence can be sufficiently considered must be determined on a case by case basis, depending on the nature of the mitigating evidence offered and whether there exists other testimony in the record that would allow consideration to be given.\" App. in No. 05-11284, pp. 159-160.</blockquote>\n<p>Applying that standard, the state court concluded that \"[t]he evidence presented at the punishment stage of the trial, especially evidence from [Cole's] expert witnesses, provide[d] a basis for the jury to sufficiently consider the mitigating evidence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 161. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the trial court's findings without substantive comment, and denied Cole's application for habeas corpus relief on November 24, 1999. <i>Id.,</i> at 178-179.</p>\n<p>In finding that the state court's decision was objectively unreasonable, the Court begins by stating that the principle the state court violated was \"firmly established,\" based on \"[a] careful review of our jurisprudence in this area.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1664. The only thing clear about our jurisprudence on the pertinent question in 1999, however, is that it was unsettled and confused.</p>\n<p>In <i>Jurek,</i> the Court upheld Texas's use of the special issues as facially constitutional, with the controlling opinion noting that \"the constitutionality of the Texas procedures turns on whether the enumerated questions allow consideration of particularized mitigating factors.\" 428 U.S., at 272, 96 S.Ct. 2950 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.). In so doing, <i>Jurek</i> left open the possibility that some mitigating evidence might not be within the reach of the jury under the special issues; other types of mitigating evidence, of course, would be. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 272-273, 96 S.Ct. 2950 (suggesting that the future dangerousness special issue allowed the jury to consider prior criminal conduct, age, duress, and whether the defendant was under extreme mental pressure).</p>\n<p>The next occasion the Court had to consider mitigating evidence under the Texas special issues arose in <i>Franklin,</i> in which the Court concluded that the defendant's mitigating evidence of good behavior in prison was taken into account under the future dangerousness special issue. 487 U.S., at 178-179, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 186-187, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). A plurality of the Court also rejected the argument that a jury must be permitted to give \"independent\" effect to mitigating evidence\u0097beyond the special issues\u0097concluding that \"this submission is foreclosed by <i>Jurek</i>\" and rejecting the dissent's argument to the contrary. <i>Id.,</i> at 179-180, and n. 10, 108 S.Ct. 2320; see also <i>id.,</i> at 199-200, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The Court today places great weight on the opinion by Justice O'Connor concurring in the judgment in <i>Franklin,</i> an opinion joined only by Justice Blackmun. <i>Ante,</i> at 1667-1669. That separate opinion expressed \"doubts\" about the plurality's view that mitigating evidence need not be given effect beyond the special issues, noting that <i>if</i> the petitioner in <i>Franklin</i> had introduced evidence not covered by the special issues, \"we would have to decide whether the jury's inability to give effect to that evidence amounted to an Eighth Amendment violation.\" 487 U.S., at 183, 185, 108 S.Ct. 2320. The separate opinion concluded, however, that \"this is not such a case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 185, 108 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1678</span> 2320. According to the Court today, a discerning state judge should have seen that federal law was \"clearly established\" on the point by the concurring and dissenting opinions, not the plurality. <i>Ante,</i> at 1667-1669.</p>\n<p><i>Penry I,</i> decided the following Term, concluded that <i>in that case</i> the Texas instructions did not allow the jury to give mitigating effect to evidence of Penry's mental retardation and abusive childhood. 492 U.S., at 328, 315, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (\"Penry does not ... dispute that some types of mitigating evidence can be fully considered by the sentencer in the absence of special jury instructions. Instead, Penry argues that, <i>on the facts of this case,</i> the jury was unable to fully consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence ... in answering the three special issues\" (emphasis added; citations omitted)). In granting relief, the Court, quoting the <i>Franklin</i> concurrence, noted that Penry's evidence \"`had relevance to [his] moral culpability beyond the scope of the special verdict questions,'\" 492 U.S., at 322, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (quoting 487 U.S., at 185, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); some alterations deleted), and that it was relevant to the special issues \"only as an <i>aggravating</i> factor.\" 492 U.S., at 323, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (emphasis in original). According to the Court today, the views of the <i>Franklin</i> concurrence and dissent were thus elevated to the opinion of the Court in <i>Penry I,</i> again clearly establishing federal law. <i>Ante,</i> at 1668-1669, and n. 15. The four dissenters in <i>Penry I</i> complained that the Court's holding \"flatly contradic[ted]\" <i>Jurek,</i> and that in finding a constitutional violation, the Court was \"throwing away <i>Jurek</i> in the process.\" 492 U.S., at 355, 354, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>A state court looking at our pertinent precedents on the Texas special issue instructions would next have to consider the significance of <i>Saffle v. Parks,</i> 494 U.S. 484, 110 S.Ct. 1257, 108 L.Ed.2d 415 (1990). That case\u0097issued less than nine months after <i>Penry I</i>\u0097considered Oklahoma instructions, but extensively analyzed <i>Penry I</i> in doing so. See 494 U.S., at 491-492, 110 S.Ct. 1257. The Court concluded that the mitigating evidence in that case could be adequately considered by the jury under the instructions given. The four dissenters in <i>Saffle</i>\u0097including the author of today's opinion\u0097complained that the majority's discussion of <i>Penry I</i> was \"strangely reminiscent\" of the position of the <i>Penry I</i> dissenters. 494 U.S., at 504, 110 S.Ct. 1257 (opinion of Brennan, J.). The <i>Saffle</i> dissenters asserted that the majority's failure to reject the position of the <i>Penry I</i> dissenters \"creates considerable ambiguity about which <i>Lockett</i> [<i>v. Ohio,</i> 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978)] claims a federal court may hereafter consider on habeas corpus review.\" 494 U.S., at 504-505, 110 S.Ct. 1257.</p>\n<p>In <i>Graham,</i> decided three years later, the Court sought to clarify the interplay between <i>Jurek, Franklin,</i> and <i>Penry I</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It seems to us, however, that reading <i>Penry</i> as petitioner urges\u0097and thereby holding that a defendant is entitled to special instructions whenever he can offer mitigating evidence that has <i>some</i> arguable relevance beyond the special issues\u0097would be to require in all cases that a fourth `special issue' be put to the jury: \"`Does any mitigating evidence before you, whether or not relevant to the above [three] questions, lead you to believe that the death penalty should not be imposed?'\" The <i>Franklin</i> plurality rejected precisely this contention, finding it irreconcilable with the Court's holding in <i>Jurek,</i> and <i>we affirm that conclusion today.</i>\" 506 U.S., at 476-477, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1679</span> 113 S.Ct. 892 (citation omitted; second emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, in <i>Graham</i> the Court rejected the reading of <i>Franklin</i> and <i>Penry I</i> that the Court today endorses, reasoning that it would require a new sentencing in every case, and would be impossible to square with <i>Jurek.</i><sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Although the Court today tells us it was clear that the applicable federal law was established by the <i>Franklin</i> concurrence and dissent, and that <i>Penry I</i> had to be read in that light, <i>ante,</i> at 1668-1669, the Court majority in <i>Graham</i> specifically relied instead upon the <i>Franklin</i> plurality in rejecting the same broad reading of <i>Penry I</i> the Court resuscitates today, <i>nunc pro tunc. </i><i>Graham, supra,</i> at 476-477, 113 S.Ct. 892. The dissenters in <i>Graham</i>\u0097 including every remaining Member of the <i>Penry I</i> majority\u0097were adamant that <i>Penry I</i> should have been controlling in <i>Graham.</i> See, <i>e.g.,</i> 506 U.S., at 507, 113 S.Ct. 892 (opinion of SOUTER, J., joined by Blackmun, STEVENS, and O'Connor, JJ.) (\"Our description of Penry's claim applies... almost precisely to Graham's claim\"); <i>id.,</i> at 508, 113 S.Ct. 892 (\"[Graham's] position is identical to that of Penry\"); <i>id.,</i> at 512, 113 S.Ct. 892 (\"<i>Penry</i> controls in this respect, and we should adhere to it\"); <i>id.,</i> at 520, 113 S.Ct. 892 (\"[T]he case is controlled by <i>Penry</i>\"). The issue is not whether the majority or the dissenters in <i>Graham</i> were right about how to read <i>Penry I,</i> but whether it was reasonable for a state court in 1999 to read it the way the majority in <i>Graham</i> plainly did.</p>\n<p>Later the same Term, in <i>Johnson,</i> the Court reaffirmed the \"limited view of <i>Penry</i>\" it had adopted in <i>Graham.</i> 509 U.S., at 365, 113 S.Ct. 2658. Once again the Court majority specifically relied on the <i>Franklin</i> plurality\u0097not the concurrence and dissent. See 509 U.S., at 370-371, 113 S.Ct. 2658. And once again the dissenters\u0097including every remaining Member of the <i>Penry I</i> majority\u0097lamented the Court's asserted failure to adhere to <i>Penry I.</i> 509 U.S., at 385-386, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Blackmun, STEVENS, and SOUTER, JJ.). The dissent\u0097by the <i>Penry I</i> author\u0097 made precisely the same point made by the Court today about how to read the <i>Franklin</i> concurrence and dissent. 509 U.S., at 385-386, 113 S.Ct. 2658. The difference, of course, was that in <i>Johnson</i> the point was made in dissent. It cannot have been \"objectively unreasonable\" for a state court, in 1999, to have been guided by the <i>Johnson</i> majority on this question, rather than by the dissent.</p>\n<p>In short, a state court reading our opinions would see an ongoing debate over the meaning and significance of <i>Penry I.</i> That state court would see four dissenters in <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i>\u0097including every remaining Member of the <i>Penry I</i> majority\u0097arguing that the Court was failing to follow or sharply limiting <i>Penry I</i> in those cases. On the flip side, the state court would see four dissenters in <i>Penry I</i>\u0097 every one later joining the majorities in <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i>\u0097suggesting that the <i>Penry I</i> majority departed from <i>Jurek.</i> It is in that context that the Court today <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1680</span> tells us that the state courts should have regarded <i>Penry I</i> as \"clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p>The Court asserts that <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i> did not \"disturb the basic legal principle\" at issue, <i>ante,</i> at 1671, and that we cite no post-<i>Penry I</i> cases inconsistent with its reading of that case, <i>ante,</i> at 1668, n. 14. I do not understand how the author of today's opinion can say that <i>Graham</i> did not disturb the principle of <i>Penry I,</i> however, when he joined a dissent in <i>Graham</i> stating that \"[Graham's] position is <i>identical</i> to that of Penry\" and that Graham's case \"is controlled by <i>Penry.</i>\" 506 U.S., at 508, 520, 113 S.Ct. 892 (opinion of SOUTER, J.) (emphasis added). That would seem to suggest that <i>Graham</i> was inconsistent with <i>Penry I.</i> I do not understand how the author of today's opinion can say that <i>Johnson</i> had no effect on <i>Penry I,</i> when he joined a dissent in <i>Johnson</i> stating that the majority opinion \"upset our settled Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.\" 509 U.S., at 382, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). Now <i>Johnson</i> is dismissed as just an application of \"basic legal principle[s],\" over which Justices can disagree, <i>ante,</i> at 1671; back then it \"upset our settled Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.\" And what of <i>Saffle</i>? There the author of today's opinion joined a dissent claiming that the majority was adopting the rule rejected in <i>Penry I.</i> 494 U.S., at 504, 110 S.Ct. 1257 (opinion of Brennan, J.). Again, that would seem to suggest inconsistency with <i>Penry I.</i><sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In fact, <i>Penry I</i> is not even consistent with the reading the Court ascribes to it\u0097 in that case the Court concluded that a jury could only view Penry's mitigating evidence as aggravating, and thus could not give the evidence <i>any</i> mitigating effect. 492 U.S., at 323, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (Penry's evidence was \"relevant only as an <i>aggravating</i> factor\" (emphasis in original)); see also <i>Graham, supra,</i> at 473, 113 S.Ct. 892 (\"Although Penry's evidence of mental impairment and childhood abuse indeed had relevance to the `future dangerousness' inquiry, its relevance was <i>aggravating</i> only\" (emphasis in original)). The Court concedes that Cole's evidence in the present case was not purely aggravating, see <i>ante,</i> at 1672 (\"[T]he jury could give mitigating effect to some of the experts' testimony\"), thus drawing into even starker contrast the rule that was established by a fair reading of <i>Penry I</i> in 1999 versus the rule the Court today reads <i>Penry I</i> to have \"clearly established.\"</p>\n<p>As might be expected in light of the foregoing, judges called upon to apply these precedents were confused by the ambiguity of this Court's pronouncements. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Mines v. Texas,</i> 888 S.W.2d 816, 820 (Tex.Crim.App.1994) (Baird, J., concurring) (\"The Supreme Court's holdings in <i>Penry, Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i> do not provide an analytical framework to determine when our capital sentencing scheme fails to allow the jury to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence ...\"); see <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1681</span> also <i>Brewer v. Dretke,</i> 442 F.3d 273, 279, n. 16 (C.A.5 2006) (<i>per curiam</i>) (remarking, in applying <i>Graham</i> and <i>Penry I,</i> that \"[t]here is no easy way to locate [the defendant] at either pole\"). Commentators at the time likewise concluded that <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i> \"put a cap on <i>Penry's</i> principles.\" Denno, Testing <i>Penry</i> and Its Progeny, 22 Am. J.Crim. L. 1, 10 (1994) (\"In <i>Graham,</i> the Court made clear that it did not interpret <i>Penry</i> `as effecting a sea change' in its evaluation of the constitutionality of the former Texas death penalty statute ...\"). See also Twenty-Eighth Annual Review of Criminal Procedure, 87 Geo. L.J. 1756, 1770 (1999) (\"The possible reach of <i>Penry</i> has been circumscribed by [<i>Graham</i>] and [<i>Johnson</i>]\").</p>\n<p>It is a familiar adage that history is written by the victors, but it goes too far to claim that the meaning and scope of <i>Penry I</i> was \"clearly established\" in 1999, especially in the wake of <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson.</i> In applying AEDPA, we have recognized that \"[a] federal court may not overrule a state court for simply holding a view different from its own, when the precedent from this Court is, at best, ambiguous.\" <i>Mitchell v. Esparza,</i> 540 U.S. 12, 17, 124 S.Ct. 7, 157 L.Ed.2d 263 (2003) (<i>per curiam</i>); see also <i>Lockyer v. Andrade,</i> 538 U.S. 63, 72-73, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (declining to find federal law \"clearly established\" when \"our precedents in [the] area have not been a model of clarity\").</p>\n<p>When the state court rejected Cole's claim, it knew that mitigating evidence of mental retardation and severe childhood abuse could not be given effect under the special issues, <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S., at 328, 109 S.Ct. 2934, but that evidence of youth and a transient upbringing could be, <i>Graham,</i> 506 U.S., at 476, 113 S.Ct. 892; <i>Johnson,</i> 509 U.S., at 368, 113 S.Ct. 2658. The court concluded that Cole's mitigating evidence \u0097 a troubled childhood and \"impulse control\" disorder \u0097 was more like that considered in <i>Johnson</i> and <i>Graham</i> than in <i>Penry I.</i> And because Cole's mitigating evidence was not as troubling as that at issue in <i>Penry I,</i> the state court did not act unreasonably in concluding that the collateral damage of his upbringing and impulse control disorder would, like youth in <i>Johnson,</i> dissipate over time, so that Cole would be less of a danger in the future. It is irrelevant that the ill effects of Cole's upbringing and impulse control disorder might not wear off for some time \u0097 there was no suggestion in <i>Johnson</i> that the petitioner in that case would become less dangerous any time soon.</p>\n<p>In other words, our precedents \u0097 which confirmed that the permanence of a mitigating feature was highly relevant, and that the correct answer was a case-specific matter turning on the particular facts \u0097 did not provide a clear answer, because the particular evidence before the court fell somewhere between the guideposts established by those precedents. As we have recognized, \"the range of reasonable judgment can depend in part on the nature of the relevant rule .... [Some] rules are more general, and their meaning must emerge in application over the course of time.\" <i>Yarborough v. Alvarado,</i> 541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004). See also <i>Brown v. Payton,</i> 544 U.S. 133, 143, 125 S.Ct. 1432, 161 L.Ed.2d 334 (2005) (reviewing state-court application of Supreme Court precedent \"to similar but not identical facts\" and concluding that \"[e]ven on the assumption that its conclusion was incorrect, it was not unreasonable, and is therefore just the type of decision that AEDPA shields on habeas review\").</p>\n<p>The state court's approach to the question was plainly correct; indeed, we engaged in a similar comparison in <i>Graham</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1682</span> itself in determining that the evidence presented in that case was cognizable under the special issues:</p>\n<blockquote>\"<i>Jurek</i> is reasonably read as holding that the circumstance of youth is given constitutionally adequate consideration in deciding the special issues. We see no reason to regard the circumstances of Graham's family background and positive character traits in a different light. Graham's evidence of transient upbringing and otherwise nonviolent character more closely resembles Jurek's evidence of age, employment history, and familial ties than it does Penry's evidence of mental retardation and harsh physical abuse.\" 506 U.S., at 476, 113 S.Ct. 892.</blockquote>\n<p>The state court thought that Cole's evidence \"more closely resemble[d]\" <i>Johnson</i> and <i>Graham</i> than <i>Penry I.</i> That cannot be said to be \"contrary to, or ... an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\" \u00a7 2254(d)(1). See <i>Brown, supra,</i> at 143, 147, 107 S.Ct. 837; <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S., at 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p>The Court further holds that the jury instructions did not permit Cole's evidence to have \"mitigating force beyond the scope of the special issues,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1670, as it now reads <i>Penry I</i> to require. At the time the state court ruled, however, <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson,</i> decided after <i>Penry I,</i> had expressly rejected the notion that a jury must \"be able to give effect to mitigating evidence in every conceivable manner in which the evidence might be relevant,\" so long as the jury could consider \"in some manner all of a defendant's relevant mitigating evidence.\" <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 372-373, 113 S.Ct. 2658. The state court found that Cole's mitigating evidence could be \"sufficiently consider[ed]\" by the jury \"within the confines of the statutory `special issues,'\" App. in No. 05-11284, at 161, 159, a holding consistent with this Court's precedents as of 1999 \u0097 and certainly not contrary to clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p>In reaching today's result, the Court also takes advantage of eight years of hindsight and relies on three cases that postdate the state court's ruling. <i>Ante,</i> at 1674 (citing <i>Penry v. Johnson,</i> 532 U.S. 782, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001) (<i>Penry II</i>), <i>Tennard v. Dretke,</i> 542 U.S. 274, 124 S.Ct. 2562, 159 L.Ed.2d 384 (2004), and <i>Smith v. Texas,</i> 543 U.S. 37, 125 S.Ct. 400, 160 L.Ed.2d 303 (2004) (<i>per curiam</i>)). What is pertinent under AEDPA, however, is whether federal law was clearly established by our decisions when the state court acted. <i>Williams, supra,</i> at 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495.<sup>[3]</sup> AEDPA requires state courts to reasonably apply clearly established federal law. It does not require them to have a crystal ball.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In 1991, petitioner Brent Ray Brewer was convicted of murder committed during the course of a robbery. Like Cole, Brewer claims that the Texas special issues prevented the jury from giving effect to mitigating evidence that he suffered from depression and had been abused as a teenager. The Texas courts rejected these claims on both direct and collateral review.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1683</span> In evaluating Brewer's claim, the Court focuses on the so-called \"two-edged sword\" nature of the evidence found to be beyond the jury's reach in <i>Penry I,</i> and concludes that Brewer's mitigating evidence is similarly double edged. The state court distinguished <i>Penry I,</i> however, stating that \"a stay in a mental hospital does not evidence a long term mental illness which would affect appellant's ability to conform to the requirements of society,\" App. in No. 05-11287, p. 141 (internal quotation marks omitted), in contrast to Penry's \"organic brain disorder ... which made it impossible for him to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law,\" <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S., at 309, 109 S.Ct. 2934. The state court determined that the nature of Brewer's evidence allowed the jury to find that he would not be a future danger, whereas Penry's did not.</p>\n<p>The Court rejects this distinction, noting that while Brewer's mitigating evidence may have been less compelling than Penry's, \"that difference does not provide an acceptable justification for refusing to apply the reasoning in <i>Penry I</i> to this case.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1661-1663, and n. 5. This misses the point. The state court's distinction goes not to the relative strength of the mitigating evidence, but rather its character \u0097 an episodic rather than permanent mental disorder. As discussed in the context of Cole, see <i>supra,</i> at 1665, the distinction was not a \"refus[al] to apply the reasoning in <i>Penry I,</i>\" <i>ante,</i> at 1661-1662, but rather an application of <i>Penry I</i> that can hardly be said to be \"objectively unreasonable\" based on this Court's decisions as of 2001. Indeed, in considering future dangerousness, it is difficult to imagine a more pertinent distinction than whether a mental condition is or is not permanent.</p>\n<p>The Court concedes that \"[t]he transient quality of [Brewer's] mitigating evidence may make it more likely to fall in part within the ambit of the special issues,\" and yet still finds the state court's decision unreasonable because the evidence may have had relevance beyond the special issues. <i>Ante,</i> at 1662. As in Cole's case, this conclusion squarely conflicts with the Court's rejection in <i>Graham</i> of the proposition that \"a defendant is entitled to special instructions whenever he can offer mitigating evidence that has <i>some</i> arguable relevance beyond the special issues.\" 506 U.S., at 476, 113 S.Ct. 892 (emphasis in original). That rejection was confirmed in <i>Johnson,</i> see 509 U.S., at 372-373, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (rejecting a rule that \"would require that a jury be able to give effect to mitigating evidence in every conceivable manner in which the evidence might be relevant\" in favor of the rule \"that a jury be able to consider in some manner all of a defendant's relevant mitigating evidence\"). Once again, the Court rejects the state court's reasonable reading of existing cases in favor of its own revisionist reading of this Court's doctrine, heavily informed by subsequent decisions that the state court had no means to predict.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In AEDPA, Congress \"work[ed] substantial changes\" to the power of federal courts to grant habeas corpus relief. <i>Felker v. Turpin,</i> 518 U.S. 651, 654, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996). In today's decisions, the Court trivializes AEDPA's requirements and overturns decades-old sentences on the ground that they were contrary to clearly established federal law at the time \u0097 even though the same Justices who form the majority today were complaining at that time that <i>this</i> Court was changing that \"clearly established\" law.</p>\n<p>Still, perhaps there is no reason to be unduly glum. After all, today the author of a dissent issued in 1988 writes two <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1684</span> majority opinions concluding that the views expressed in that dissent actually represented \"clearly established\" federal law at that time. So there is hope yet for the views expressed in <i>this</i> dissent, not simply down the road, but <i>tunc pro nunc.</i> Encouraged by the majority's determination that the future can change the past, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, and with whom Justice ALITO joins as to Part I, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I remain of the view \"that limiting a jury's discretion to consider all mitigating evidence does not violate the Eighth Amendment.\" <i>Ayers v. Belmontes,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 469, 480, 166 L.Ed.2d 334 (2006) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (citing <i>Walton v. Arizona,</i> 497 U.S. 639, 673, 110 S.Ct. 3047, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>But even under this Court's precedents to the contrary, the state-court decisions in these two cases were hardly objectively unreasonable under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissenting opinion demonstrates. That is all which is needful to demonstrate the error of today's judgments. The full truth is worse than that, however. There was in fact clearly established law that governed these cases, and it favored the State. When the state courts rendered their decisions, <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> 509 U.S. 350, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993), was this Court's most recent pronouncement on the Texas special issues. And in that case, the Court unambiguously drew back from the broader implications of its prior decision in <i>Penry v. Lynaugh,</i> 492 U.S. 302, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989) (<i>Penry I</i>). Reiterating what it had recently said in <i>Graham v. Collins,</i> 506 U.S. 461, 475, 113 S.Ct. 892, 122 L.Ed.2d 260 (1993), the Court made clear that \"`[i]n <i>Penry,</i> the defendant's evidence was placed before the sentencer but the sentencer had <i>no reliable means</i> of giving mitigating effect to that evidence.'\" <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 366, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (emphasis added). <i>Penry I,</i> said <i>Johnson,</i> stood for the proposition that habeas relief was appropriate where jurors had been unable to give <i>any</i> mitigating effect to the evidence at issue. 509 U.S., at 369, 113 S.Ct. 2658; see also <i>Graham, supra,</i> at 475, 113 S.Ct. 892. <i>Penry I</i> in no way meant to imply, <i>Johnson</i> warned, \"that a jury [must] be able to give effect to mitigating evidence in <i>every conceivable manner</i> in which the evidence might be relevant.\" 509 U.S., at 372, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (emphasis added). <i>Johnson</i> thus established, in no uncertain terms, that jurors need only \"be able to consider <i>in some manner</i> all of a defendant's relevant mitigating evidence.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added); see generally <i>id.,</i> at 372-373, 113 S.Ct. 2658.</p>\n<p>The dissenters in <i>Johnson</i> very much disagreed with that analysis. They read <i>Penry I</i> for the more expansive proposition that \"the Texas special issues violated the Eighth Amendment to the extent they prevented the jury from giving <i>full</i> consideration and effect to a defendant's relevant mitigating evidence.\" 509 U.S., at 385, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (citing <i>Penry I, supra</i><i>;</i> emphasis added and deleted). \"[H]aving <i>some</i> relevance to [a special] issue,\" the dissent said, \"was not sufficient.\" 509 U.S., at 385, 113 S.Ct. 2658. And because youth (the mitigating feature in <i>Johnson</i>) had obvious relevance <i>beyond</i> the special issues, an additional instruction was needed. <i>Id.,</i> at 375, 113 S.Ct. 2658. The differences between the <i>Johnson</i> majority and dissenters could not have been more pronounced.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1685</span> Today the Court overrules <i>Johnson sub silentio,</i> and reinstates the \"full effect\" interpretation of <i>Penry I.</i> For as THE CHIEF JUSTICE explains, <i>ante,</i> at 1681, 1683 (dissenting opinion), it was not objectively unreasonable for the state courts to conclude that the ill effects of petitioners' mental illnesses and difficult childhoods would wear off in due time, allowing the jury to give that mitigating evidence <i>some effect</i> through the future dangerousness instruction \u0097 just as could be done for the mitigating factor of youth in <i>Johnson.</i> The Court nonetheless reverses these sentences because the juries were unable to give effect to \"any independent concern\" (independent, that is, of the Texas special issues) that the defendants \"may not be deserving of a death sentence,\" <i>Brewer,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct. <i>ante</i> at 1712, 2007 WL 1201609, or to consider the evidence's \"relevance to the defendant's moral culpability beyond the scope of the special verdict questions,\" <i>id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. at 1713, 2006 WL 477142 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court does not acknowledge that it is overruling <i>Johnson,</i> but makes the Court of Appeals the scapegoat for its change of heart.</p>\n<p>The Fifth Circuit in both of these cases relied heavily on <i>Johnson</i> when denying relief. See <i>Cole v. Dretke,</i> 418 F.3d 494, 505 (2005); <i>Brewer v. Dretke,</i> 442 F.3d 273, 278, 281 (2006) (relying on <i>Cole</i>). How does the Court manage to distinguish it? The Court tries two main lines of argument. First, the Court explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A critical assumption motivating the Court's decision in <i>Johnson</i> was that juries would in fact be able to give mitigating effect to the evidence, albeit within the confines of the special issues .... Prosecutors in some subsequent cases, however, have undermined this assumption, taking pains to convince jurors that the law compels them to disregard the force of evidence offered in mitigation.\" <i>Abdul-Kabir, ante,</i> at 1673.</blockquote>\n<p>Because <i>Johnson's</i> \"critical assumption\" has now been \"undermined,\" the Court says, <i>Johnson</i> cannot be said to \"foreclos[e] relief in these circumstances.\" <i>Abdul-Kabir, ante,</i> at 1673.</p>\n<p>This attempt to \"distinguish\" <i>Johnson</i> wilts under even the mildest scrutiny. Since when does this Court craft constitutional rules that depend on the beneficence of the prosecutor? (Never mind that this \"critical assumption\" of <i>Johnson</i> was not so critical as to be mentioned in the case.) And more importantly, how can prosecutorial style have <i>any</i> bearing on whether the Eighth Amendment requires a jury to be able to give \"some effect,\" as opposed to \"full effect,\" to a defendant's mitigating evidence? It is of course true that a prosecutor's arguments may be relevant evidence in the final analysis of <i>whether</i> a capital trial has met the \"some effect\" test. But it has absolutely no relevance to <i>which test</i> is selected in the first place.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, the Court explains that \"the consideration of the defendant's mitigating evidence of youth in <i>Johnson</i> could easily have directed jurors towards a `no' answer with regard to the question of future dangerousness,\" whereas a juror considering petitioners' mitigating evidence \"could feel compelled to provide a `yes' answer to the same question.\" <i>Abdul-Kabir, ante,</i> at 1673. But it is quite apparent that jurors <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1686</span> considering youth in <i>Johnson</i> could also have \"fe[lt] compelled to provide a `yes' answer\" to the future dangerousness question. While one can believe that \"the impetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside,\" <i>Johnson,</i> 509 U.S., at 368, 113 S.Ct. 2658, one can also believe that a person who kills even in his younger years is fundamentally depraved, and more prone to a life of violent crime. <i>Johnson</i> itself explicitly recognized this point, denying relief despite \"the fact that a juror might view the evidence of youth as aggravating, as opposed to mitigating.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>As the Court's opinion effectively admits, nothing of a legal nature has changed since <i>Johnson.</i> What <i>has</i> changed are the moral sensibilities of the majority of the Court. For those in Texas who have already received the ultimate punishment, this judicial moral awakening comes too late. <i>Johnson</i> was the law, until today. And in the almost 15 years in-between, the Court today tells us, state and lower federal courts in countless appeals, and this Court in numerous denials of petitions for writ of certiorari, have erroneously relied on <i>Johnson</i> to allow the condemned to be taken to the death chamber. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Robison v. Johnson,</i> 151 F.3d 256, 269 (C.A.5 1998) (denying petition for rehearing), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1100, 119 S.Ct. 1578, 143 L.Ed.2d 673 (1999) (petitioner executed Jan. 21, 2000); <i>Motley v. Collins,</i> 18 F.3d 1223, 1233-1235 (C.A.5), cert. denied <i>sub nom. Motley v. Scott,</i> 513 U.S. 960, 115 S.Ct. 418, 130 L.Ed.2d 333 (1994) (petitioner executed Feb. 7, 1995).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The individuals duly tried and executed between <i>Johnson</i> and today's decisions were not, in my view (my view at the time of <i>Johnson,</i> and my view now), entitled to federal judicial invalidation of their state-imposed sentences. That is because in my view the meaning of the Eighth Amendment is to be determined not by the moral perceptions of the Justices <i>du jour,</i> but by the understanding of the American people who adopted it \u0097 which understanding did not remotely include any requirement that a capital jury be permitted to consider all mitigating factors. If, however, a majority of the Justices are going to govern us by their moral perceptions, in this area at least they ought to get their moral perceptions right the first time. Whether one regards improvised death-is-different jurisprudence with disdain or with approval, no one can be at ease with the stark reality that this Court's vacillating pronouncements have produced grossly inequitable treatment of those on death row. Relief from sentence of death because of the jury's inability to give \"full effect\" to all mitigating factors has been made available only to those who have managed to drag out their habeas proceedings until today. This is not justice. It is caprice.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For purposes of consistency with testimony given by witnesses at trial and sentencing, we refer to petitioner throughout the opinion by his given name, Ted Cole.</p>\n<p>[2]  These were the two standard Texas special issues in place at the time of Cole's sentencing. In 1991, the Texas Legislature amended the special issues in response to this Court's decision in <i>Penry v. Lynaugh,</i> 492 U.S. 302, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989) <i>(Penry I)</i><i>,</i> to include language instructing the jury to decide \"[w]hether, taking into consideration all of the evidence, including the circumstances of the offense, the defendant's character and background, and the personal moral culpability of the defendant, there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole rather than a death sentence be imposed.\" Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071, \u00a7 2(e)(1) (Vernon 2006).</p>\n<p>[3]  Although Cole had not raised any of the 21 claims presented in his state habeas application on direct appeal\u0097including his claim that the jury heard significant mitigating evidence which it could neither consider nor give effect to under the Texas sentencing statute, in violation of <i>Penry I</i>\u0097under state law, his <i>Penry</i> claim remained cognizable on state habeas review. See <i>Ex parte Kunkle,</i> 852 S.W.2d 499, 502, n. 3 (Tex.Crim.App.1993) (en banc) (holding that \"we have held that [allegations of <i>Penry</i> error occurring in cases tried before <i>Penry</i>] are cognizable via habeas corpus despite an applicant's failure to raise them on direct appeal\"). Nor did Cole's failure to raise this claim on direct appeal affect its later review under AEDPA by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. See <i>Jackson v. Johnson,</i> 150 F.3d 520, 523 (C.A.5 1998) (holding that Texas' postconviction procedures provide petitioners \"adjudication on the merits\" sufficient to satisfy 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)).</p>\n<p>[4]  The trial judge also noted that there were \"no controverted, previously unresolved factual issues regarding petitioner's <i>Pendry</i> [sic] claim.\" App. 161.</p>\n<p>[5]  The contrast between the District Court's succinct statement of <i>Penry I's</i> holding and the prosecutor's explanation at <i>voir dire</i> of the jurors' duty to answer the special issues on the basis of the facts presented and not their views about Cole's moral culpability, see Part I, <i>supra,</i> could not be more stark.</p>\n<p>[6]  The Court of Appeals distinguished <i>Penry I</i> on the ground that Penry's evidence of mental retardation could only have been considered as aggravating, whereas this \"record does not suggest that the jury viewed Cole's mitigating evidence as an aggravating factor only.... [T]his evidence fits well within the broad scope of the future dangerousness special issue....\" 418 F.3d, at 506-507, and n. 54.</p>\n<p>[7]  In his dissent, Judge Dennis argued that the panel had improperly \"used another Fifth Circuit gloss upon a Supreme Court decision, i.e., the double edged evidence limitation of <i>Penry I,</i> that has no basis in the Supreme Court decisions, to avoid confronting the real issue.\" <i>Cole v. Dretke,</i> 443 F.3d 441, 442 (C.A.5 2006) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>[8]  The opinion also referred to a proposition that \"cannot fairly be denied\u0097that death is a punishment different from all other sanctions in kind rather than degree,\" and continued on to conclude that \"[a] process that accords no significance to relevant facets of the character and record of the individual offender or the circumstances of the particular offense excludes from consideration in fixing the ultimate punishment of death the possibility of compassionate or mitigating factors stemming from the diverse frailties of humankind.\" <i>Woodson,</i> 428 U.S., at 303-304, 96 S.Ct. 2978.</p>\n<p>[9]  \"By authorizing the defense to bring before the jury at the separate sentencing hearing whatever mitigating circumstances relating to the individual defendant can be adduced, Texas has ensured that the sentencing jury will have adequate guidance to enable it to perform its sentencing function.\" <i>Jurek,</i> 428 U.S., at 276, 96 S.Ct. 2950 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.); see also <i>Proffitt,</i> 428 U.S., at 257-258, 96 S.Ct. 2960 (same).</p>\n<p>[10]  In <i>Penry I</i> itself, the Court noted that the rule sought by Penry\u0097\"that when such mitigating evidence is presented, Texas juries must, upon request, be given jury instructions that make it possible for them to give effect to that mitigating evidence in determining whether the death penalty should be imposed\u0097is not a `new rule' under <i>Teague</i> [<i>v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989),] because it is dictated by <i>Eddings</i> and <i>Lockett.</i>\" 492 U.S., at 318-319, 109 S.Ct. 2934.</p>\n<p>[11]  See Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 2929.04(B)(7) (Anderson 1982) (amended 1981) (adding, as a mitigating circumstance, \"[a]ny other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death\").</p>\n<p>[12]  To the extent that <i>Jurek</i> implied at the time it was decided that all that was required by the Constitution was that the defense be authorized to introduce all relevant mitigating circumstances, and that such information merely be before the jury, it has become clear from our later cases that the mere ability to present evidence is not sufficient. The only mitigating evidence presented in <i>Jurek</i>\u0097offered to rebut the State's witnesses' testimony about Jurek's bad reputation in the community\u0097appears to have consisted of Jurek's father's testimony that Jurek had \"always been steadily employed since he had left school and that he contributed to his family's support.\" 428 U.S., at 267, 96 S.Ct. 2950. Therefore, the question presented in our later cases\u0097 namely, whether the jury was precluded from giving meaningful effect to mitigating evidence, particularly that which may go to a defendant's lack of moral culpability\u0097was not at issue in that case. When we deemed the Texas sentencing scheme constitutionally adequate in <i>Jurek,</i> we clearly failed to anticipate that when faced with various other types of mitigating evidence, the Texas special issues would not provide the sentencing jury with the requisite \"adequate guidance.\"</p>\n<p>[13]  In <i>Jurek v. Texas,</i> 428 U.S. 262, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976), this Court held that the Texas capital sentencing procedures satisfied the Eighth Amendment requirement that the sentencer be allowed to consider circumstances mitigating against capital punishment. It was observed that even though the statute did not explicitly mention mitigating circumstances, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had construed the special verdict question regarding the defendant's future dangerousness to permit jury consideration of the defendant's prior criminal record, age, mental state, and the circumstances of the crime in mitigation. <i>Id.,</i> at 271-273, 96 S.Ct. 2950. Since the decision in <i>Jurek,</i> we have emphasized that the Constitution guarantees a defendant facing a possible death sentence not only the right to introduce evidence mitigating against the death penalty but also the right to <i>consideration</i> of that evidence by the sentencing authority. <i>Lockett v. Ohio,</i> 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), established that a State may not prevent the capital sentencing authority \"from giving <i>independent mitigating weight</i> to aspects of the defendant's character and record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 605, 98 S.Ct. 2954 (plurality opinion). We reaffirmed this conclusion in <i>Eddings v. Oklahoma,</i> 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), and in <i>Hitchcock v. Dugger,</i> 481 U.S. 393, 107 S.Ct. 1821, 95 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987). <i>Franklin,</i> 487 U.S., at 183-184, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[14]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent incorrectly assumes that our holding today adopts the rule advocated by the petitioner in <i>Graham v. Collins,</i> 506 U.S. 461, 113 S.Ct. 892, 122 L.Ed.2d 260 (1993), namely, that \"`a defendant is entitled to special instructions whenever he can offer mitigating evidence that has <i>some</i> arguable relevance beyond the special issues.'\" <i>Post,</i> at 1678 (quoting <i>Graham,</i> 506 U.S., at 476, 113 S.Ct. 892; emphasis in <i>Graham</i>). The rule that we reaffirm today\u0097a rule that has been clearly established since our decision in <i>Penry I</i>\u0097is this: Special instructions are necessary when the jury could not otherwise give <i>meaningful effect</i> to a defendant's mitigating evidence. The rule is narrower than the standard urged by Graham because special instruction is not required when mitigating evidence has only a tenuous connection\u0097\"<i>some</i> arguable relevance\"\u0097to the defendant's moral culpability. But special instruction is necessary when the defendant's evidence may have meaningful relevance to the defendant's moral culpability \"beyond the scope of the special issues.\" <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S., at 322-323, 109 S.Ct. 2934. Despite the dissent's colorful rhetoric, it cites no post-<i>Penry I</i> cases inconsistent with this reading of its holding.</p>\n<p>[15]  In <i>Franklin,</i> however, the five concurring and dissenting Justices did not share the plurality's categorical reading of <i>Jurek.</i> In the plurality's view, <i>Jurek</i> had expressly and unconditionally upheld the manner in which mitigating evidence is considered under the special issues. <i>Id.,</i> at 179-180, and n. 10, 108 S.Ct. 2320. In contrast, five Members of the Court read <i>Jurek</i> as not precluding a claim that, in a particular case, the jury was unable to fully consider the mitigating evidence introduced by a defendant in answering the special issues. 487 U.S., at 183, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 199-200, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). \"Indeed, both the concurrence and the dissent understood <i>Jurek</i> as resting fundamentally on the express assurance that the special issues would permit the jury to fully consider all the mitigating evidence a defendant introduced that was relevant to the defendant's background and character and to the circumstances of the offense.\" <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S., at 320-321, 109 S.Ct. 2934; see also <i>id.,</i> at 318, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (\"[T]he facial validity of the Texas death penalty statute had been upheld in <i>Jurek</i> on the basis of assurances that the special issues would be interpreted broadly enough to enable sentencing juries to consider all of the relevant mitigating evidence a defendant might present\").</p>\n<p>[16]  It is also clear that <i>Penry I</i> applies in cases involving evidence that is neither double edged nor purely aggravating, because in some cases a defendant's evidence may have mitigating effect beyond its ability to negate the special issues. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Tennard v. Dretke,</i> 542 U.S. 274, 288-289, 124 S.Ct. 2562, 159 L.Ed.2d 384 (2004) (holding that petitioner was entitled to a COA on his <i>Penry</i> claim where his evidence of low IQ and impaired intellectual functioning had \"mitigating dimension beyond the impact it has on the individual's ability to act deliberately\"). In <i>Tennard,</i> the majority declined to accept the dissent's argument that the petitioner's evidence of low intelligence did \"not necessarily create the <i>Penry I</i> `two-edged sword,'\" and therefore could be given adequate mitigating effect within the context of the future dangerousness special issue. 542 U.S., at 293, 124 S.Ct. 2562 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). Cf. <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> 509 U.S. 350, 386, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), in turn citing <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S., at 355, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"The Court today holds that `the constitutionality turns on whether the [special] questions allow mitigating factors not only to be considered ..., <i>but also to be given effect in all possible ways, including ways that the questions do not permit</i>'\" (emphasis in original)); cf. also <i>Smith v. Texas,</i> 543 U.S. 37, 41, 46-48, 125 S.Ct. 400, 160 L.Ed.2d 303 (2004) <i>(per curiam)</i> (reversing the CCA's denial of postconviction relief because the special issues did not provide an adequate vehicle for expressing a \"`reasoned moral response'\" to petitioner's evidence of low IQ and a troubled upbringing).</p>\n<p>[17]  The lynchpin of THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent is his assumption that Justice O'Connor's opinions in <i>Franklin</i> and <i>Penry I</i> merely described two ad hoc judgments\u0097see <i>post,</i> at 1675-1676, 1677-1678\u0097rather than her understanding of the governing rule of law announced in <i>Lockett, Eddings,</i> and <i>Hitchcock v. Dugger,</i> 481 U.S. 393, 107 S.Ct. 1821, 95 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987). In his view, our line of cases in this area has flip-flopped, depending on the composition of the majority, rather than slowly defining core principles by eliminating those interpretations of the rule that are unsupportable. The fact that Justice O'Connor's understanding of the law was confirmed by the Court in <i>Penry I</i> in 1989\u0097 well before AEDPA was enacted\u0097is a sufficient response to most of the rhetoric in the dissent. Neither Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court in <i>Penry I,</i> nor any other opinion she joined, ever endorsed the \"`<i>some</i> arguable relevance'\" position described by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, see <i>post,</i> at 1678, 1383, which mistakenly interprets our opinion as adopting the rule that the dissenters in <i>Franklin</i> and <i>Saffle</i> would have chosen, see <i>post,</i> at 1678, 1683. The fact that the Court never endorsed that broader standard is fully consistent with our conclusion that the narrower rule applied in <i>Penry I</i> itself is \"clearly established.\" Arguments advanced in later dissenting opinions do not affect that conclusion.</p>\n<p>[18]  The Texas cases relied upon by the court were <i>Garcia v. State,</i> 919 S.W.2d 370, 398-399 (Tex.Crim.App.1996) (en banc) (holding that, in light of the fact that Garcia received a <i>\"Penry\"</i> instruction (included in the amended Texas special issues), which instructed the jury to consider the defendant's character and background in determining whether to impose life rather than death, he was not entitled to any special instructions requiring the jury to consider his drug use, alcoholism, and family background as mitigating evidence); <i>Mines v. State,</i> 888 S.W.2d 816, 818 (Tex. Crim.App.1994) (en banc) (holding, on remand after <i>Johnson,</i> that Mines' mitigating evidence of bipolar disorder was \"well within the effective reach of the jury\"); and <i>Zimmerman v. State,</i> 881 S.W.2d 360, 362 (Tex.Crim. App. 1994) (en banc) (holding, also on remand after <i>Johnson,</i> that Zimmerman's \"mitigating\" evidence of low IQ, past substance abuse, a diagnosis of paranoid personality disorder, and a disruptive family environment did not warrant an additional instruction under <i>Johnson</i> or <i>Penry I</i>).</p>\n<p>[19]  Graham claimed that the Texas system had not \"allowed for adequate consideration of mitigating evidence concerning his youth, family background, and positive character traits\"; in <i>Johnson,</i> we declined to adopt such a rule, even without the <i>Teague</i> bar that prevented us from doing so in <i>Graham.</i> 509 U.S., at 365-366, 113 S.Ct. 2658.</p>\n<p>[20]  This fact should be reassuring to those who fear that the rule we endorse today\u0097and which we have endorsed since <i>Penry I</i>\u0097 \"would require a new sentencing in every case.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1679 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[21]  A jury may be precluded from doing so not only as a result of the instructions it is given, but also as a result of prosecutorial argument dictating that such consideration is forbidden. See Part VI, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>[22]  Because THE CHIEF JUSTICE's only concern is with the proper application of AEDPA, he finds it unnecessary to define the rule that he thinks post-<i>Penry I</i> cases either did or should have applied. What is most relevant under AEDPA, however, is the holdings set forth in majority opinions, rather than the views of dissenters who supported a different understanding of the law at the time those opinions were written.</p>\n<p>[23]  We came to the same conclusion in <i>Graham,</i> after distinguishing the defendant's mitigating evidence in that case from that offered by the defendant in <i>Penry I:</i>\n</p>\n<p>\"The jury was not forbidden to accept the suggestion of Graham's lawyers that his brief spasm of criminal activity in May 1981 was properly viewed, in light of his youth, his background, and his character, as an aberration that was not likely to be repeated. Even if Graham's evidence, like Penry's, had significance beyond the scope of the first special issue, it is apparent that Graham's evidence\u0097 <i>unlike</i> Penry's\u0097had mitigating relevance to the second special issue concerning his likely future dangerousness. Whereas Penry's evidence compelled an affirmative answer to that inquiry, despite its mitigating significance, Graham's evidence quite readily could have supported a negative answer.\" 506 U.S., at 475-476, 113 S.Ct. 892.</p>\n<p>[24]  In <i>Graham,</i> we acknowledged that <i>Penry I</i> did not \"effec[t] a sea change in this Court's view of the constitutionality of the former Texas death penalty statute.\" <i>Graham,</i> 506 U.S., at 474, 113 S.Ct. 892. The reason, of course, that this was not the case is because the rule set forth in <i>Penry I</i> was merely an application of the settled <i>Lockett-Eddings-Hitchcock</i> rule described by Justice O'Connor in her opinions.</p>\n<p>[25]  Without making any attempt to explain how the jury in either this case or in <i>Brewer v. Quarterman,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1706, 167 L.Ed.2d 622, 2007 WL 1201609, could have given \"meaningful effect\" or a \"reasoned moral response\" to either defendant's mitigating evidence, THE CHIEF JUSTICE concludes his dissent by lamenting the fact that the views shared by Justice O'Connor's concurrence and the dissenters in <i>Franklin</i> in 1988\u0097and later endorsed in <i>Penry I</i>\u0097\"actually represented `clearly established' federal law at that time.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1684. To his credit, his concluding sentence does not go so far as to state that he favors a <i>\"tunc pro nunc\"</i> rejection of those views, an endorsement of the views expressed by the four dissenters in <i>Penry I,</i> or even agreement with the Fifth Circuit's recently rejected test for identifying relevant mitigating evidence. See <i>Nelson v. Quarterman,</i> 472 F.3d 287, 291-293 (2006) (en banc) (recognizing the \"now-defunct\" nature of the Fifth Circuit's \"`constitutional-relevance' test\" post-<i>Tennard</i> and that a \"`full-effect'\" standard\u0097meaning that \"a juror be able to express his reasoned moral response to evidence that has mitigating relevance beyond the scope of the special issues\"\u0097was \"clearly established\" for purposes of AEDPA in 1994, when Nelson's conviction became final).</p>\n<p>[1]  In evaluating the state court's analysis, the Court criticizes its reliance on <i>Graham</i> because <i>Graham</i> primarily addressed retroactivity under <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). <i>Ante,</i> at 1671. But in considering whether the rule requested was dictated by precedent, <i>Graham</i> of course had to evaluate the scope of that precedent\u0097including <i>Penry I</i>\u0097and did so extensively. See 506 U.S., at 467-477, 113 S.Ct. 892. Moreover, as explained below, the Court in <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> 509 U.S. 350, 370-372, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993), adopted the same reading of <i>Penry I</i> adopted in <i>Graham,</i> without considering the issue under <i>Teague.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  The Court is correct that \"[w]hat is most relevant under AEDPA ... is the holdings set forth in majority opinions, rather than the views of dissenters ... at the time those opinions were written.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1672, n. 22. But that must include the majority opinions in all the pertinent cases, not just the lone one of the bunch that ruled in favor of the defendant. Here it must include the subsequent majority opinions in <i>Saffle, Graham,</i> and <i>Johnson,</i> as well as in <i>Penry I,</i> and it was not objectively unreasonable for a state court to view <i>Saffle, Graham,</i> and <i>Johnson</i> the same way today's author did at the time\u0097or at least to conclude that the Court's current view of <i>Penry I</i> was not as clearly established as the Court would have it today.</p>\n<p>[3]  The Court criticizes this dissent for failing \"to define the rule\" that our post-<i>Penry I</i> cases either did or should have applied. <i>Ante,</i> at 1672, n. 22. But the whole point is that \"the rule,\" far from being \"clearly established\" by our decisions, was \u0097 at the very least \u0097 unsettled and confused. Under AEDPA, those defending the finality of a state-court judgment challenged on federal habeas review do not have to show that the state-court judgment was consistent with some version of \"clearly established Federal law\" other than that offered by the challenger; AEDPA obviously contemplates that there <i>may not be</i> \"clearly established Federal law.\" The Court's criticism only underscores how far the reasoning employed today strays from AEDPA's mandate.</p>\n<p>[*]  Relatedly, the Court thinks <i>Johnson</i> distinguishable because jurors have \"experienced\" youth but \"have never experienced\" the \"particularized childhood experiences of abuse and neglect\" at issue here. <i>Abdul-Kabir, ante,</i> at 1672-1673. It is again quite impossible to understand, however, how that can have any bearing upon whether \"some effect\" or \"full effect\" is the required test.</p>\n\n</div>",

QUARTERMAN, DIREC\n\n TOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, \n\n     CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 05\u201311284.       Argued January 17, 2007\u2014Decided April 25, 2007\nPetitioner Abdul-Kabir (fka Cole) was convicted of capital murder. At\n  sentencing, the trial judge asked the jury to answer two special is\n  sues, affirmative answers to which would require the judge to impose\n  a death sentence: whether Cole\u2019s conduct was committed deliberately\n  and with the reasonable expectation it would result in his victim\u2019s\n  death and whether it was probable he would commit future violent\n  acts constituting a continuing threat to society. Cole\u2019s mitigating\n  evidence included family members\u2019 testimony describing his unhappy\n  childhood as well as expert testimony which, to some extent, contra\n  dicted the State\u2019s claim he was dangerous, but primarily sought to\n  reduce his moral culpability by explaining his violent propensities as\n  attributable to neurological damage and childhood neglect and aban\n  donment. However, the prosecutor discouraged jurors from taking\n  these latter considerations into account, advising them instead to an\n  swer the special issues based only on the facts and to disregard any\n  other views as to what might constitute an appropriate punishment\n  for this particular defendant. After the trial judge\u2019s refusal to give\n  Cole\u2019s requested instructions, which would have authorized a nega\n  tive answer to either of the special issues on the basis of any evidence\n  the jury perceived as mitigating, the jury answered both issues in the\n  affirmative, and Cole was sentenced to death. The Texas Court of\n  Criminal Appeals (CCA) affirmed on direct appeal, and Cole applied\n  for habeas relief in the trial court, which ultimately recommended\n  denial of the application. Adopting the trial court\u2019s findings of fact\n  and conclusions of law with respect to all of Cole\u2019s claims, including\n  his argument that the special issues precluded the jury from properly\n2                   ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    considering and giving effect to his mitigating evidence, the CCA de\n    nied Cole collateral relief.\n      Cole then filed a federal habeas petition, asserting principally that\n    the sentencing jury was unable to consider and give effect to his miti\n    gating evidence in violation of the Constitution. Recognizing that\n    Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (Penry I), required that juries be\n    given instructions allowing them to give effect to a defendant\u2019s miti\n    gating evidence and to express their reasoned moral response to that\n    evidence in determining whether to recommend death, the District\n    Court nevertheless relied on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis for evaluat\n    ing Penry claims, requiring a defendant to show a nexus between his\n    uniquely severe permanent condition and the criminal act attributed\n    to that condition. Ultimately, Cole\u2019s inability to do so doomed his\n    Penry claim. After the Fifth Circuit denied Cole\u2019s application for a\n    certificate of appealability (COA), this Court held that the Circuit\u2019s\n    test for determining the constitutional relevance of mitigating evi\n    dence had \u201cno foundation in the decisions of this Court,\u201d Tennard v.\n    Dretke, 542 U. S. 274, 284, and therefore vacated the COA denial. On\n    remand, the Fifth Circuit focused primarily on Cole\u2019s expert testi\n    mony rather than that of his family, concluding that the special is\n    sues allowed the jury to give full consideration and full effect to his\n    mitigating evidence, and affirming the denial of federal habeas relief.\nHeld: Because there is a reasonable likelihood that the state trial\n court\u2019s instructions prevented jurors from giving meaningful consid\n eration to constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence, the CCA\u2019s\n merits adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\n law, as determined by [this] Court,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), and\n thereby warranted federal habeas relief. Pp. 10\u201330.\n    (a) This Court has long recognized that sentencing juries must be\n able to give meaningful consideration and effect to all mitigating evi\n dence that might provide a basis for refusing to impose the death\n penalty on a particular individual, notwithstanding the severity of\n his crime or his potential to commit similar offenses in the future.\n See, e.g., the plurality opinion in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604.\n Among other things, however, the Lockett plurality distinguished the\n Ohio statute there invalidated from the Texas statute upheld in\n Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, on the ground that the latter Act did\n not \u201cclearly operat[e] at that time to prevent the sentencer from con\n sidering any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character and record or any\n circumstances of his offense as an independently mitigating factor,\u201d\n 438 U. S., at 607. Nevertheless, the Court later made clear that sen\n tencing under the Texas statute must accord with the Lockett rule.\n In Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164, 185, Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opin\n                   Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nion concurring in the judgment expressed the view of five Justices\nwhen she emphasized that \u201cthe right to have the sentencer consider\nand weigh relevant mitigating evidence would be meaningless unless\nthe sentencer was also permitted to give effect to its consideration\u2019 in\nimposing sentence.\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion for the Court in\nPenry I, which unquestionably governs the facts of this case, en\ndorsed the same views she had expressed in Franklin. In Penry I, the\nCourt first held that in contending that his mental-retardation and\nabusive-childhood mitigating evidence provided a basis for a life sen\ntence rather than death and that the sentencing jury should have\nbeen instructed to consider that evidence, Penry was not asking the\nCourt to make new law because he was relying on a rule \u201cdictated\u201d by\nearlier cases, 492 U. S., at 321, as defined by Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s con\ncurrence in Franklin v. Lynaugh. Applying that standard, Penry I\nheld that neither of Texas\u2019 special issues allowed the jury to give\nmeaningful effect to Penry\u2019s mitigating evidence. The Penry I Court\nemphasized with respect to Texas\u2019 \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d special is\nsue (as composed at the time of both Penry\u2019s and Cole\u2019s sentencing\nproceedings) that Penry\u2019s mitigating evidence functioned as a \u201ctwo\nedged sword\u201d because it might \u201cdiminish his blameworthiness . . .\neven as it indicate[d] a probability that he [would] be dangerous.\u201d\n492 U. S., at 324. The Court therefore required an appropriate in\nstruction directing a jury to consider fully the mitigating evidence as\nit bears on the extent to which a defendant is undeserving of death.\nId., at 323. Thus, where the evidence is double edged or as likely to\nbe viewed as aggravating as it is as mitigating, the statute does not\nallow it to be given adequate consideration. Pp. 10\u201320.\n   (b) The Texas trial judge\u2019s recommendation to the CCA to deny col\nlateral relief in this case was unsupported by either the text or the\nreasoning in Penry I. Under Penry I, Cole\u2019s family members\u2019 testi\nmony, as well as the portions of his expert testimony suggesting that\nhis dangerousness resulted from a rough childhood and neurological\ndamage, were not relevant to either of the special verdict questions,\nexcept, possibly, as evidence of future dangerousness. Because this\nwould not satisfy Penry I\u2019s requirement that the evidence be permit\nted its mitigating force beyond the special issues\u2019 scope, it would have\nfollowed that those issues failed to provide the jury with a vehicle for\nexpressing its \u201creasoned moral response\u201d to Cole\u2019s mitigating evi\ndence. In denying Cole relief, however, the Texas trial judge relied\nnot on Penry I, but on three later Texas cases and Graham v. Collins,\n506 U. S. 461, defining the legal issue whether the mitigating evi\ndence could be sufficiently considered as one to be determined on a\ncase-by-case basis, depending on the evidence\u2019s nature and on\nwhether its consideration was enabled by other evidence in the re\n4                    ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    cord. The state court\u2019s primary reliance on Graham was misguided.\n    In concluding that granting collateral relief to a defendant sentenced\n    to death in 1984 would require the announcement of a new constitu\n    tional rule, the Graham Court, 506 U. S., at 468\u2013472, relied heavily\n    on the fact that in 1984 it was reasonable for judges to rely on the\n    Franklin plurality\u2019s categorical reading of Jurek, which, in its view,\n    expressly and unconditionally upheld the manner in which mitigat\n    ing evidence is considered under the special issues. But in both\n    Franklin and Penry I, a majority ultimately rejected that interpreta\n    tion. While neither Franklin nor Penry I was inconsistent with Gra\n    ham\u2019s narrow holding, they suggest that later decisions\u2014including\n    Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350, which refused to adopt the rule\n    Graham sought\u2014are more relevant to Cole\u2019s case. The relevance of\n    those cases lies not in their results, but in their failure to disturb the\n    basic legal principle that continues to govern such cases: The jury\n    must have a \u201cmeaningful basis to consider the relevant mitigating\n    qualities\u201d of the defendant\u2019s proffered evidence. Id., at 369. Several\n    other reasons demonstrate that the CCA\u2019s ruling was not a reason\n    able application of Penry I. First, the ruling ignored the fact that\n    Cole\u2019s mitigating evidence of childhood deprivation and lack of self-\n    control was relevant to his moral culpability for precisely the same\n    reason as Penry\u2019s: It did not rebut either deliberateness or future\n    dangerousness but was intended to provide the jury with an entirely\n    different reason for not imposing death. Second, the trial judge\u2019s as\n    sumption that it would be appropriate to look at other testimony to\n    determine whether the jury could give mitigating effect to Cole\u2019s fam\n    ily testimony is neither reasonable nor supported by Penry I. Third,\n    simply because the jury could give mitigating effect to the experts\u2019\n    predictions that Cole should become less dangerous as he aged does\n    not mean that the jury understood it could give such effect to other\n    portions of the experts\u2019 testimony or that of other witnesses. Pp. 21\u2013\n    24.\n       (c) Four of the Court\u2019s more recent cases support the conclusion\n    that the CCA\u2019s decision was unsupported by Penry I\u2019s text or reason\n    ing. Although holding in Johnson, 509 U. S., at 368, that the Texas\n    special issues allowed adequate consideration of petitioner\u2019s youth as\n    a mitigating circumstance, the Court also declared that \u201cPenry re\n    mains the law and must be given a fair reading,\u201d ibid. Arguments\n    like those of Cole\u2019s prosecutor that the special issues require jurors to\n    disregard the force of evidence offered in mitigation and rely only on\n    the facts are at odds with the Johnson Court\u2019s understanding that ju\n    ries could and would reach mitigating evidence proffered by a defen\n    dant. Further, evidence such as that presented by Cole is not like the\n    evidence of youth offered in Johnson and Graham, which easily could\n                     Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                    5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  have supported a negative answer to the question of future danger\n  ousness, and is instead more like the evidence offered in Penry I,\n  which compelled an affirmative answer to the same question, despite\n  its mitigating significance. That fact provides further support for the\n  conclusion that in a case like Cole\u2019s, there is a reasonable likelihood\n  that the special issues would preclude the jury from giving meaning\n  ful consideration to such mitigating evidence, as required by Penry I.\n  In three later cases, the Court gave Penry I the \u201cfair reading\u201d John\n  son contemplated, repudiating several Fifth Circuit precedents pro\n  viding the basis for its narrow reading of Penry I.

He further contends that the judg\nment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) deny\ning his application for postconviction relief on November\n24, 1999, misapplied the law as clearly established by\nearlier decisions of this Court, thereby warranting relief\nunder the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nof 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254. We agree with both\ncontentions. Although the relevant state-court judgment\nfor purposes of our review under AEDPA is that adjudicat\ning the merits of Cole\u2019s state habeas application, in which\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 For purposes of consistency with testimony given by witnesses at\n\ntrial and sentencing, we refer to petitioner throughout the opinion by\nhis given name, Ted Cole.\n2                 ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthese claims were properly raised, we are persuaded that\nthe same result would be dictated by those cases decided\nbefore the state trial court entered its judgment affirming\nCole\u2019s death sentence on September 26, 1990. Accord\ningly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nand remand for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                             I\n  In December 1987, Cole, his stepbrother Michael\nHickey, and Michael\u2019s wife, Kelly, decided to rob and kill\nKelly\u2019s grandfather, Raymond Richardson, to obtain some\ncash. Two days later they did so. Cole strangled Richard\nson with a dog leash; the group then searched the house\nand found $20 that they used to purchase beer and food.\nThe next day, Michael and Kelly surrendered to the police\nand confessed. The police then arrested Cole who also\nconfessed.\n  Cole was tried by a jury and convicted of capital murder.\nAfter a sentencing hearing, the jury was asked to answer\ntwo special issues:\n         \u201cWas the conduct of the defendant, TED CALVIN\n       COLE, that caused the death of the deceased,\n       RAYMOND C. RICHARDSON, committed deliber\n       ately and with the reasonable expectation that the\n       death of the deceased or another would result?\n           .           .          .          .          .\n         \u201cIs there a probability that the defendant, TED\n       CALVIN COLE, would commit criminal acts of vio\n       lence that would constitute a continuing threat to so\n       ciety?\u201d App. 127\u2013128.2\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Thesewere the two standard Texas special issues in place at the\ntime of Cole\u2019s sentencing. In 1991, the Texas Legislature amended the\nspecial issues in response to this Court\u2019s decision in Penry v. Lynaugh,\n492 U. S. 302 (1989) (Penry I), to include language instructing the jury\n                   Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  The trial judge instructed the jury to take into consid\neration evidence presented at the guilt phase as well as\nthe sentencing phase of the trial but made no reference to\nmitigating evidence. Under the provisions of the Texas\ncriminal code, the jury\u2019s affirmative answers to these two\nspecial issues required the judge to impose a death sen\ntence. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071\n(Vernon 2006).\n  At the sentencing hearing, the State introduced evi\ndence that Cole pleaded guilty to an earlier murder when\nhe was only 16. Shortly after being released on parole,\nCole pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated sexual as\nsault on two boys and was sentenced to 15 more years in\nprison. As evidence of Cole\u2019s propensity for future danger\nousness, the State introduced Cole\u2019s diary which, accord\ning to the State\u2019s expert psychiatrist, Dr. Richard Coons,\nrevealed a compulsive attraction to young boys and an\nobsession with criminal activity. Dr. Coons described Cole\nas a sociopath who lacked remorse and would not profit or\nlearn from his experiences.\n  In response, Cole presented two categories of mitigating\nevidence. The first consisted of testimony from his mother\nand his aunt, who described his unhappy childhood. Cole\u2019s\nparents lived together \u201coff and on\u201d for 10 years, over the\ncourse of which they had two children, Cole, and his\nyounger sister, Carla. App. 35. Shortly after Cole was\nborn, his father was arrested for robbing a liquor store.\nCole\u2019s father deserted the family several times, abandon\ning the family completely before Cole was five years old.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nto decide \u201c[w]hether, taking into consideration all of the evidence,\n\nincluding the circumstances of the offense, the defendant\u2019s character\n\nand background, and the personal moral culpability of the defendant, \n\nthere is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to \n\nwarrant that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole rather\n\nthan a death sentence be imposed.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art.\n\n37.071, \u00a72(e)(1) (Vernon 2006). \n\n4              ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nOn the last occasion that Cole saw his father, he dropped\nCole off a block from where he thought Cole\u2019s mother\nlived, told Cole to \u201cgo find her,\u201d and drove off. Id., at 42.\nCole had no contact with his father during the next 10\nyears. Ibid. After Cole\u2019s father left, his mother found\nherself unable to care for Cole and his sister and took the\nchildren to live with her parents in Oklahoma. Cole\u2019s\ngrandparents were both alcoholics\u2014Cole\u2019s mother was\nherself a self-described \u201cdrunk\u201d\u2014and lived miles away\nfrom other children. Eventually, because Cole\u2019s grandpar\nents did not want their daughter or her children living\nwith them, Cole\u2019s mother placed him in a church-run\nchildren\u2019s home, although she kept her daughter with her.\nOver the next five years Cole\u2019s mother visited him only\ntwice. Cole\u2019s aunt, who visited him on holidays, testified\nthat Cole seemed incapable of expressing any emotion and\nthat his father never visited him at all.\n   The second category of mitigating evidence came from\ntwo expert witnesses\u2014a psychologist and the former chief\nmental health officer for the Texas Department of Correc\ntions\u2014who discussed the consequences of Cole\u2019s childhood\nneglect and abandonment. Dr. Jarvis Wright, the psy\nchologist, spent 8 to 10 hours interviewing Cole and ad\nministering an \u201cextensive battery of psychological tests.\u201d\nId., at 63. He testified that Cole had \u201creal problems with\nimpulse control\u201d apparently resulting from \u201ccentral nerv\nous damage\u201d combined with \u201call the other factors of [his]\nbackground.\u201d Id., at 69. He also testified that Cole had\nlikely been depressed for much of his life, that he had a\n\u201cpainful\u201d background, and that he had \u201cnever felt loved\nand worthwhile in his life.\u201d Id., at 73, 86.

S. ____ (2007)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non the street, there\u2019s a much greater probability of dan\ngerous behavior than with the rest of us.\u201d Id., at 74.\nAlthough he acknowledged the possibility of change or\n\u201cburn out,\u201d he admitted that Cole would likely pose a\nthreat of future dangerousness until \u201cyears from now.\u201d\nIbid. Except for his prediction that Cole would change as\nhe grew older, Dr. Wright\u2019s testimony did not contradict\nthe State\u2019s claim that Cole was a dangerous person, but\ninstead sought to provide an explanation for his behavior\nthat might reduce his moral culpability.\n  Dr. Wendell Dickerson, a psychologist who had not\npreviously examined Cole, observed that it was difficult to\npredict future dangerousness, but that \u201cviolent conduct is\npredominantly, overwhelmingly the province of the young\u201d\nwith the risk of violence becoming rare as people grow\nolder. Id., at 95. On cross-examination, in response to a\nhypothetical question about a person with Cole\u2019s character\nand history, Dr. Dickerson acknowledged that he would be\n\u201calarmed\u201d about the future conduct of such a person be\ncause \u201cyes, there absolutely is a probability that they\nwould commit . . . future acts of violence.\u201d Id., at 113. In\nsum, the strength of Cole\u2019s mitigating evidence was not its\npotential to contest his immediate dangerousness, to\nwhich end the experts\u2019 testimony was at least as harmful\nas it was helpful. Instead, its strength was its tendency to\nprove that his violent propensities were caused by factors\nbeyond his control\u2014namely, neurological damage and\nchildhood neglect and abandonment.\n  It was these latter considerations, however, that the\nprosecutor discouraged jurors from taking into account\nwhen formulating their answers to the special issues.\nDuring the voir dire, the prosecutor advised the jurors\nthat they had a duty to answer the special issues based on\nthe facts, and the extent to which such facts objectively\nsupported findings of deliberateness and future danger\nousness, rather than their views about what might be an\n6              ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nappropriate punishment for this particular defendant. For\nexample, juror Beeson was asked:\n     \u201c[I]f a person had a bad upbringing, but looking at\n     those special issues, you felt that they [sic] met the\n     standards regarding deliberateness and being a con\n     tinuing threat to society, could you still vote \u2018yes,\u2019\n     even though you felt like maybe they\u2019d [sic] had a\n     rough time as a kid? If you felt that the facts brought\n     to you by the prosecution warranted a \u2018yes\u2019 answer,\n     could you put that out of your mind and just go by the\n     facts?\n          .           .          .          .           .\n     [T]hat would not keep you from answering \u2018yes,\u2019 just\n     because a person had a poor upbringing, would it?\u201d XI\n     Voir Dire Statement of Facts filed in No. CR88\u20130043\u2013\n     A (Dist. Ct. Tom Green Cty., Tex., 51st Jud. Dist.), p.\n     1588.\n   The prosecutor began his final closing argument with a\nreminder to the jury that during the voir dire they had\n\u201cpromised the State that, if it met its burden of proof,\u201d\nthey would answer \u201cyes\u201d to both special issues. App. 145.\nThe trial judge refused to give any of several instructions\nrequested by Cole that would have authorized a negative\nanswer to either of the special issues on the basis of \u201cany\nevidence which, in [the jury\u2019s] opinion, mitigate[d] against\nthe imposition of the Death Penalty, including any aspect\nof the Defendant\u2019s character or record.\u201d Id., at 115; see\nalso id., at 117\u2013124. Ultimately, the jurors answered both\nissues in the affirmative and Cole was sentenced to death.\n   On direct appeal, the sole issue raised by Cole was that\nthe evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\nThe CCA rejected Cole\u2019s claim and affirmed the judgment\nof the trial court on September 26, 1990.\n                           II\n    On March 2, 1992, the lawyer who then represented\n                     Cite as: 550 U.

Id., at 152\u2013153. During that hearing, Cole advised\nthe court that he wished to proceed with his habeas pro\nceedings and to have the CCA appoint counsel to represent\nhim. Without counsel having been appointed to represent\nCole, and without conducting an evidentiary hearing, the\ntrial court entered its findings and conclusions recom\nmending denial of the application.\n   Three of Cole\u2019s 21 claims related to the jury\u2019s inability to\nconsider mitigating evidence. The trial judge rejected the\nfirst\u2014\u201cthat his mitigating evidence was not able to be\nproperly considered and given effect by the jury under the\nspecial issues,\u201d id., at 157\u2014because he concluded that the\nrecord, and \u201cespecially\u201d the testimony of the two expert\nwitnesses, \u201cprovide[d] a basis for the jury to sufficiently\nconsider the mitigating evidence offered by petitioner,\u201d4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Although Cole had not raised any of the 21 claims presented in his\n\nstate habeas application on direct appeal\u2014including his claim that the\njury heard significant mitigating evidence which it could neither\nconsider nor give effect to under the Texas sentencing statute, in\nviolation of Penry I\u2014under state law, his Penry claim remained cogni\nzable on state habeas review. See Ex parte Kunkle, 852 S. W. 2d 499,\n502, n. 3 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (en banc) (holding that \u201cwe have held\nthat [allegations of Penry error occurring in cases tried before Penry]\nare cognizable via habeas corpus despite an applicant\u2019s failure to raise\nthem on direct appeal\u201d). Nor did Cole\u2019s failure to raise this claim on\ndirect appeal affect its later review under AEDPA by the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. See Jackson v. Johnson, 150\nF. 3d 520, 523 (CA5 1998) (holding that Texas\u2019 postconviction proce\ndures provide petitioners \u201cadjudication on the merits\u201d sufficient to\nsatisfy 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)).\n  4 The trial judge also noted that there were \u201cno controverted, previ\n\nously unresolved factual issues regarding petitioner\u2019s Pendry [sic]\n8                   ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nid., at 161. With respect to Cole\u2019s second claim, the judge\nagreed that appellate counsel had been ineffective for\nfailing to assign error based on \u201cthe trial court\u2019s failure to\ninstruct the jury on mitigating evidence as contemplated\nby the Pendry [sic] decision.\u201d Id., at 166. He nevertheless\nfound that the result on appeal would have been the same\nhad the point been raised. Ibid. On the third claim relat\ning to mitigating evidence, the judge rejected Cole\u2019s argu\nment that the trial court\u2019s failure to specifically instruct\nthe jury to consider mitigating evidence and offer a defini\ntion of \u201cmitigating\u201d was error. Id., at 173.\n   Over the dissent of two members of the court, and after\nadopting the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions\nof law with only minor changes, the CCA denied Cole\u2019s\napplication for state collateral relief. Ex parte Cole, No.\n41,673\u201301 (Nov. 24, 1999) (per curiam), App. 178\u2013179. We\nconsolidated this case with Brewer v. Quarterman, post, p.\n___, and granted certiorari, 549 U. S. ___ (2006).\n                             III\n  After the Federal District Court granted Cole\u2019s motion\nfor the appointment of counsel, he filed a timely petition\nfor a federal writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254. His principal claim then, as it is now, was that the\nsentencing jury \u201cwas unable to consider and give effect to\nthe mitigating evidence in his case,\u201d in violation of the\nConstitution. Cole v. Johnson, Civ. Action No. 6:00\u2013CV\u2013\n014\u2013C (ND Tex., Mar. 6, 2001), p. 5, App. 184.\n  In its opinion denying relief, the District Court began by\nsummarizing Cole\u2019s mitigating evidence, highlighting his\n\u201cdestructive family background.\u201d Ibid. The court then\ncorrectly described our decision in Penry I, 492 U.

Action No. 6:00\u2013CV\u2013014\u2013C, at 8\u20139,\n     App. 188.\n   The court next noted that the Fifth Circuit had formu\nlated its own analysis for evaluating Penry claims. Under\nthat analysis, for mitigating evidence to be constitution\nally relevant, it \u201cmust show (1) a uniquely severe perma\nnent handicap with which the defendant is burdened\nthrough no fault of his own, . . . and (2) that the criminal\nact was attributable to this severe permanent condition.\u201d\nCiv. Action No. 6:00\u2013CV\u2013014\u2013C, at 9, App. 189 (quoting\nDavis v. Scott, 51 F. 3d 457, 460\u2013461 (CA5 1995) (internal\nquotation marks omitted; emphasis added)). Ultimately,\nCole\u2019s inability to show a \u201cnexus\u201d between his troubled\nfamily background and his commission of capital murder\ndoomed his Penry claim. Civ. Action No. 6:00\u2013CV\u2013014\u2013C,\nat 13, App. 193.\n   The Court of Appeals denied Cole\u2019s application for a\ncertificate of appealability (COA), holding that \u201creasonable\njurists would not debate the district court\u2019s conclusion that\nCole\u2019s evidence was not constitutionally relevant mitigat\ning evidence.\u201d Cole v. Dretke, 418 F. 3d 494, 498 (CA5\n2005). Shortly thereafter, however, we held that the Fifth\nCircuit\u2019s \u201cscreening test\u201d for determining the \u201c \u2018constitu\ntional relevance\u2019 \u201d of mitigating evidence had \u201cno founda\ntion in the decisions of this Court.\u201d Tennard v. Dretke, 542\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The contrast between the District Court\u2019s succinct statement of\n\nPenry I\u2019s holding and the prosecutor\u2019s explanation at voir dire of the\njurors\u2019 duty to answer the special issues on the basis of the facts pre\nsented and not their views about Cole\u2019s moral culpability, see Part I,\nsupra, could not be more stark.\n10                ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 274, 284 (2004). Accordingly, we vacated its order\ndenying a COA in this case and remanded for further\nproceedings. On remand, the Court of Appeals reviewed\nCole\u2019s Penry claim on the merits and affirmed the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment denying the writ.\n  Focusing primarily on the testimony of petitioner\u2019s two\nexperts rather than that of his mother and his aunt, the\nCourt of Appeals reviewed our recent decisions and con\ncluded \u201cthat the Texas special issues allowed the jury to\ngive \u2018full consideration and full effect\u2019 to the mitigating\nevidence that Cole presented at the punishment phase of\nhis trial.\u201d6 418 F. 3d, at 511. With two judges dissenting,\nthe court denied the petition for rehearing en banc.7\n                             IV\n  Because Cole filed his federal habeas petition after the\neffective date of AEDPA, the provisions of that Act govern\nthe scope of our review. We must therefore ask whether\nthe CCA\u2019s adjudication of Cole\u2019s claim on the merits \u201cre\nsulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). We conclude that it did.\n  A careful review of our jurisprudence in this area makes\nclear that well before our decision in Penry I, our cases\nhad firmly established that sentencing juries must be able\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The  Court of Appeals distinguished Penry I on the ground that\nPenry\u2019s evidence of mental retardation could only have been considered\nas aggravating, whereas this \u201crecord does not suggest that the jury\nviewed Cole\u2019s mitigating evidence as an aggravating factor only . . . .\n[T]his evidence fits well within the broad scope of the future danger\nousness special issue . . . .\u201d 418 F. 3d, at 506\u2013507, and n. 54.\n  7 In his dissent, Judge Dennis argued that the panel had improperly\n\n\u201cused another Fifth Circuit gloss upon a Supreme Court decision, i.e.,\nthe double edged evidence limitation of Penry I, that has no basis in the\nSupreme Court decisions, to avoid confronting the real issue.\u201d Cole v.\nDretke, 443 F. 3d 441, 442 (CA5 2006) (per curiam).\n                     Cite as: 550 U.

Three of the five\ncases decided on the same day in 1976\u2014 Woodson v. North\nCarolina, 428 U. S. 280 (1976), Proffitt v. Florida, 428\nU. S. 242 (1976), and Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262\n(1976)\u2014identified the background principles we would\napply in later cases to evaluate specific rules inhibiting\nthe jury\u2019s ability to give meaningful effect to such mitigat\ning evidence.\n  In Woodson v. North Carolina, we invalidated a statute\nthat made death the mandatory sentence for all persons\nconvicted of first-degree murder. One of the statute\u2019s\nconstitutional shortcomings was its \u201cfailure to allow the\nparticularized consideration of relevant aspects of the\ncharacter and record of each convicted defendant before\nthe imposition upon him of a sentence of death.\u201d 428\nU. S., at 303 (plurality opinion).8 In Proffitt v. Florida and\nJurek v. Texas, the joint opinions rejected facial challenges\nto the sentencing statutes enacted in Florida and Texas,\nassuming in both cases that provisions allowing for the\nunrestricted admissibility of mitigating evidence would\nensure that a sentencing jury had adequate guidance in\nperforming its sentencing function.9 As a majority of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The   opinion also referred to a proposition that \u201ccannot fairly be\ndenied\u2014that death is a punishment different from all other sanctions\nin kind rather than degree,\u201d and continued on to conclude that \u201c[a]\nprocess that accords no significance to relevant facets of the character\nand record of the individual offender or the circumstances of the par\nticular offense excludes from consideration in fixing the ultimate\npunishment of death the possibility of compassionate or mitigating\nfactors stemming from the diverse frailties of humankind.\u201d Woodson,\n428 U. S., at 303\u2013304.\n   9 \u201cBy authorizing the defense to bring before the jury at the separate\n\nsentencing hearing whatever mitigating circumstances relating to the\n12                ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt later acknowledged, our holding in Jurek did not\npreclude the possibility that the Texas sentencing statute\nmight be found unconstitutional as applied in a particular\ncase. See n. 15, infra.\n   Two years later, in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978),\na plurality concluded \u201cthat the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments require that the sentencer, in all but the\nrarest kind of capital case, not be precluded from consider\ning, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant\u2019s\ncharacter or record and any of the circumstances of the\noffense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sen\ntence less than death.\u201d Id., at 604 (footnote omitted).\nBecause Ohio\u2019s death penalty statute was inconsistent\nwith this principle, it was declared unconstitutional. The\nplurality noted the possible tension between a holding that\nthe Ohio statute was invalid and our decisions in Proffitt\nand Jurek upholding the Florida and Texas statutes, but\ndistinguished those cases because neither statute \u201cclearly\noperated at that time to prevent the sentencer from con\nsidering any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character and re\ncord or any circumstances of his offense as an independ\nently mitigating factor.\u201d 438 U. S., at 607.\n   While Chief Justice Burger\u2019s opinion in Lockett was\njoined by only three other Justices, the rule it announced\nwas endorsed and broadened in our subsequent decisions\nin Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), and Skip\nper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986). In those cases,\nwe emphasized the severity of imposing a death sentence\nand that \u201cthe sentencer in capital cases must be permitted\nto consider any relevant mitigating factor.\u201d 10 Eddings,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nindividual defendant can be adduced, Texas has ensured that the\nsentencing jury will have adequate guidance to enable it to perform its\nsentencing function.\u201d Jurek, 428 U.

S., at 257\u2013258\n(same).\n  10 In Penry I itself, the Court noted that the rule sought by Penry\u2014\n                     Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n455 U. S., at 112 (emphasis added).\n  In the wake of our decision in Lockett, Ohio amended its\ncapital sentencing statute to give effect to Lockett\u2019s hold\ning.11 Neither Florida nor Texas did so, however, until\nafter our unanimous decision in Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481\nU. S. 393 (1987), unequivocally confirmed the settled\nquality of the Lockett rule. As JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s opinion\nfor the Court explained, the defendant had introduced\nsome rather atypical mitigating evidence that was not\nexpressly authorized by the Florida statute:\n     \u201cIn the sentencing phase of this case, petitioner\u2019s\n     counsel introduced before the advisory jury evidence\n     that as a child petitioner had the habit of inhaling\n     gasoline fumes from automobile gas tanks; that he\n     had once passed out after doing so; that thereafter his\n     mind tended to wander; that petitioner had been one\n     of seven children in a poor family that earned its liv\n     ing by picking cotton; that his father had died of can\n     cer; and that petitioner had been a fond and affection\n     ate uncle to the children of one of his brothers.\u201d 481\n     U. S., at 397.\nAs the opinion further explained, the Florida courts had\nconstrued the state statute to preclude consideration of\nmitigating factors unmentioned in the statute. Accord\ningly, despite our earlier decision in Proffitt upholding the\nstatute against a facial challenge, it was necessary to set\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cthat when such mitigating evidence is presented, Texas juries must,\nupon request, be given jury instructions that make it possible for them\nto give effect to that mitigating evidence in determining whether the\ndeath penalty should be imposed\u2014is not a \u2018new rule\u2019 under Teague [v.\nLane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989),] because it is dictated by Eddings and\nLockett.\u201d 492 U. S., at 318\u2013319.\n  11 See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a72929.04(B)(7) (Anderson 1982) (amended\n\n1981) (adding, as a mitigating circumstance, \u201c[a]ny other factors that\nare relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to\ndeath\u201d).\n14                ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\naside Hitchcock\u2019s death sentence. We explained:\n     \u201cWe think it could not be clearer that the advisory\n     jury was instructed not to consider, and the sentenc\n     ing judge refused to consider, evidence of nonstatutory\n     mitigating circumstances, and that the proceedings\n     therefore did not comport with the requirements of\n     Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), Ed-\n     dings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), and Lockett\n     v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978) (plurality opinion). Re\n     spondent has made no attempt to argue that this er\n     ror was harmless, or that it had no effect on the jury\n     or the sentencing judge. In the absence of such a\n     showing our cases hold that the exclusion of mitigat\n     ing evidence of the sort at issue here renders the\n     death sentence invalid. See Skipper, supra (evidence\n     that defendant had adapted well to prison life); Ed-\n     dings, supra (evidence of 16-year-old defendant\u2019s\n     troubled family history and emotional disturbance).\u201d\n     481 U.

In Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164, 172, 177, 183\n(1988), the plurality rejected the claim that the judge\u2019s\ninstructions did not allow the jury to give adequate weight\nto whatever \u201c \u2018residual doubts\u2019 \u201d it may have had concern\ning the defendant\u2019s guilt, or to evidence of the petitioner\u2019s\ngood behavior while in prison. That particular holding is\nunremarkable because we have never held that capital\ndefendants have an Eighth Amendment right to present\n\u201cresidual doubt\u201d evidence at sentencing, see Oregon v.\nGuzek, 546 U. S. 517, 523\u2013527 (2006), and in most cases\nevidence of good behavior in prison is primarily, if not\nexclusively, relevant to the issue of future dangerousness.\nWhat makes Franklin significant, however, is the separate\nopinion of Justice O\u2019Connor, and particularly those por\ntions of her opinion expressing the views of five Justices,\nsee infra, at 18, and n. 15. After summarizing the cases\nthat clarified Jurek\u2019s holding,13 she wrote:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfore, the question presented in our later cases\u2014namely, whether the\njury was precluded from giving meaningful effect to mitigating evi\ndence, particularly that which may go to a defendant\u2019s lack of moral\nculpability\u2014was not at issue in that case. When we deemed the Texas\nsentencing scheme constitutionally adequate in Jurek, we clearly failed\nto anticipate that when faced with various other types of mitigating\nevidence, the Texas special issues would not provide the sentencing\njury with the requisite \u201cadequate guidance.\u201d\n  13 \u201cIn Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262 (1976), this Court held that the\n\nTexas capital sentencing procedures satisfied the Eighth Amendment\nrequirement that the sentencer be allowed to consider circumstances\nmitigating against capital punishment. It was observed that even\nthough the statute did not explicitly mention mitigating circumstances,\nthe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had construed the special verdict\nquestion regarding the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness to permit jury\nconsideration of the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, age, mental\nstate, and the circumstances of the crime in mitigation.

QUARTERMAN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n     \u201cIn my view, the principle underlying Lockett, Ed-\n     dings, and Hitchcock is that punishment should be di\n     rectly related to the personal culpability of the crimi\n     nal defendant.\n     \u201c \u2018[E]vidence about the defendant\u2019s background and\n     character is relevant because of the belief, long held\n     by this society, that defendants who commit criminal\n     acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged back\n     ground, or to emotional and mental problems, may be\n     less culpable than defendants who have no such ex\n     cuse. . . . Thus, the sentence imposed at the penalty\n     stage should reflect a reasoned moral response to the\n     defendant\u2019s background, character, and crime.\u2019 Cali\n     fornia v. Brown, 479 U. S. 538, 545 (1987) (O\u2019Connor,\n     J., concurring) (emphasis in original).\n     \u201cIn light of this principle it is clear that a State may\n     not constitutionally prevent the sentencing body from\n     giving effect to evidence relevant to the defendant\u2019s\n     background or character or the circumstances of the\n     offense that mitigates against the death penalty. In\n     deed, the right to have the sentencer consider and\n     weigh relevant mitigating evidence would be meaning\n     less unless the sentencer was also permitted to give ef\n     fect to its consideration.\n     \u201cUnder the sentencing procedure followed in this case\n     the jury could express its views about the appropriate\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntution guarantees a defendant facing a possible death sentence not only\nthe right to introduce evidence mitigating against the death penalty\nbut also the right to consideration of that evidence by the sentencing\nauthority. Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), established that a\nState may not prevent the capital sentencing authority \u2018from giving\nindependent mitigating weight to aspects of the defendant\u2019s character\nand record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation.\u2019\nId., at 605 (plurality opinion).

Collins,\n506 U. S. 461 (1993), namely, that \u201c \u2018a defendant is entitled to special\ninstructions whenever he can offer mitigating evidence that has some\narguable relevance beyond the special issues.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 7 (quoting\nGraham, 506 U.

The rule that we\nreaffirm today\u2014a rule that has been clearly established since our\ndecision in Penry I\u2014is this: Special instructions are necessary when the\njury could not otherwise give meaningful effect to a defendant\u2019s mitigat\ning evidence. The rule is narrower than the standard urged by Graham\nbecause special instruction is not required when mitigating evidence\nhas only a tenuous connection\u2014\u201csome arguable relevance\u201d\u2014to the\ndefendant\u2019s moral culpability. But special instruction is necessary\nwhen the defendant\u2019s evidence may have meaningful relevance to the\ndefendant\u2019s moral culpability \u201cbeyond the scope of the special issues.\u201d\nPenry I, 492 U.

QUARTERMAN\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ntion and an abusive childhood provided a basis for a sen\ntence of life imprisonment rather than death and that the\njury should have been instructed that it could consider\nthat evidence when making its sentencing decision. In\nresponse to that contention, our opinion first held that\nPenry was not asking us to make new law because he was\nrelying on a rule that was \u201cdictated\u201d by earlier cases, see\nn. 10, supra, and explained why Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s sepa\nrate opinion in Franklin correctly defined the relevant\nrule of law.15 In Franklin, we noted, \u201cboth the concurrence\nand the dissent stressed that \u2018the right to have the sen\ntencer consider and weigh relevant mitigating evidence\nwould be meaningless unless the sentencer was also per\nmitted to give effect to its consideration\u2019 in imposing sen\ntence.\u201d 492 U. S., at 321 (citing Franklin, 487 U.

In the plural\nity\u2019s view, Jurek had expressly and unconditionally upheld the manner\nin which mitigating evidence is considered under the special issues.\nId., at 179\u2013180, and n. 10. In contrast, five Members of the Court read\nJurek as not precluding a claim that, in a particular case, the jury was\nunable to fully consider the mitigating evidence introduced by a defen\ndant in answering the special issues. 487 U.

With respect to the\nformer, we explained:\n    \u201cIn the absence of jury instructions defining \u2018deliber\n    ately\u2019 in a way that would clearly direct the jury to\n    consider fully Penry\u2019s mitigating evidence as it bears\n    on his personal culpability, we cannot be sure that the\n    jury was able to give effect to the mitigating evidence\n    of Penry\u2019s mental retardation and history of abuse in\n    answering the first special issue. Without such a spe\n    cial instruction, a juror who believed that Penry\u2019s re\n    tardation and background diminished his moral cul\n    pability and made imposition of the death penalty\n    unwarranted would be unable to give effect to that\n    conclusion if the juror also believed that Penry com\n    mitted the crime \u2018deliberately.\u2019 Thus, we cannot be\n    sure that the jury\u2019s answer to the first special issue\n    reflected a \u2018reasoned moral response\u2019 to Penry\u2019s miti\n    gating evidence.\u201d 492 U. S., at 323.\n   With respect to the future dangerousness issue, we\nemphasized the fact that Penry\u2019s evidence of mental re\ntardation was relevant only as an aggravating factor. Id.,\nat 323\u2013324. More broadly, we noted that the evidence of\nPenry\u2019s mental retardation and childhood abuse func\ntioned as a \u201ctwo-edged sword,\u201d because it \u201cmay diminish\nhis blameworthiness for his crime even as it indicates that\nthere is a probability that he will be dangerous in the\nfuture.\u201d Id., at 324. We therefore held that, in the ab\nsence of an appropriate instruction directing the \u201cjury to\nconsider fully\u201d mitigating evidence as it bears on the\nextent to which a defendant is undeserving of a death\nsentence, \u201cwe cannot be sure\u201d that it did so. Id., at 323.\nAs our discussion of the deliberateness issue demon\nstrates, we did not limit our holding in Penry I to mitigat\ning evidence that can only be viewed as aggravating.\n20                 ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nWhen the evidence proffered is double edged, or is as\nlikely to be viewed as aggravating as it is as mitigating,\nthe statute most obviously fails to provide for adequate\nconsideration of such evidence.16\n   The former special issues (as composed at the time of\nboth Penry\u2019s and Cole\u2019s sentencing proceedings) provided\nan adequate vehicle for the evaluation of mitigating evi\ndence offered to disprove deliberateness or future danger\nousness. As Judge Reavley noted in his opinion for the\nCourt of Appeals in Penry I, however, they did not tell the\njury as to what \u201cto do if it decided that Penry, because of\nretardation, arrested emotional development and a trou\nbled youth, should not be executed.\u201d Id., at 324 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 It is also clear that Penry I applies in cases involving evidence that\n\nis neither double edged nor purely aggravating, because in some cases a\ndefendant\u2019s evidence may have mitigating effect beyond its ability to\nnegate the special issues. See, e.g., Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U. S. 274,\n288\u2013289 (2004) (holding that petitioner was entitled to a COA on his\nPenry claim where his evidence of low IQ and impaired intellectual\nfunctioning had \u201cmitigating dimension beyond the impact it has on the\nindividual\u2019s ability to act deliberately\u201d). In Tennard, the majority\ndeclined to accept the dissent\u2019s argument that the petitioner\u2019s evidence\nof low intelligence did \u201cnot necessarily create the Penry I \u2018two-edged\nsword,\u2019 \u201d and therefore could be given adequate mitigating effect within\nthe context of the future dangerousness special issue. 542 U.

Under the framework set forth in Penry I,17 the\ntestimony of Cole\u2019s mother and aunt, as well as the por\ntions of the expert testimony suggesting that his danger\nous character may have been the result of his rough child\nhood and possible neurological damage, were not relevant\nto either of the special verdict questions, except, possibly,\nas evidence supporting the State\u2019s argument that Cole\nwould be dangerous in the future. This would not satisfy\nthe requirement of Penry I, however, that the evidence be\npermitted its mitigating force beyond the scope of the\nspecial issues. Therefore, it would have followed that\nthose questions failed to provide the jury with a vehicle for\nexpressing its \u201creasoned moral response\u201d to that evidence.\n   Instead of relying on Penry I, the trial judge relied on\nthree later Texas cases and on our opinion in Graham v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   17 The lynchpin of THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s dissent is his assumption that\n\nJustice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinions in Franklin and Penry I merely described\ntwo ad hoc judgments\u2014see post, at 2, 5\u20136\u2014rather than her under\nstanding of the governing rule of law announced in Lockett, Eddings,\nand Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U. S. 393 (1987). In his view, our line of\ncases in this area has flip-flopped, depending on the composition of the\nmajority, rather than slowly defining core principles by eliminating\nthose interpretations of the rule that are unsupportable. The fact that\nJustice O\u2019Connor\u2019s understanding of the law was confirmed by the\nCourt in Penry I in 1989\u2014well before AEDPA was enacted\u2014is a suffi\ncient response to most of the rhetoric in the dissent. Neither Justice\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion for the Court in Penry I, nor any other opinion she\njoined, ever endorsed the \u201c \u2018some arguable relevance\u2019 \u201d position described\nby THE CHIEF JUSTICE, see post, at 7, 16, which mistakenly interprets\nour opinion as adopting the rule that the dissenters in Franklin and\nSaffle would have chosen, see post, at 7, 16. The fact that the Court\nnever endorsed that broader standard is fully consistent with our\nconclusion that the narrower rule applied in Penry I itself is \u201cclearly\nestablished.\u201d Arguments advanced in later dissenting opinions do not\naffect that conclusion.\n22                ABDUL-KABIR v.

S. 461 (1993), as having held that nine\ndifferent categories of mitigating evidence\u2014including a\ntroubled family background, bipolar disorder, low IQ,\nsubstance abuse, paranoid personality disorder, and child\nabuse\u2014were sufficiently considered under the Texas\nspecial issues.18 App. 159\u2013160. Applying those cases, the\njudge defined the legal issue \u201cwhether the mitigating\nevidence can be sufficiently considered\u201d as one that \u201cmust\nbe determined on a case by case basis, depending on the\nnature of the mitigating evidence offered and whether\nthere exists other testimony in the record that would allow\nconsideration to be given.\u201d Id., at 160. As we have noted,\nin endorsing this formulation of the issue, neither the trial\njudge nor the CCA had the benefit of any input from coun\nsel representing petitioner. See Part II, supra. In our\nview, denying relief on the basis of that formulation of the\nissue, while ignoring the fundamental principles estab\nlished by our most relevant precedents, resulted in a\ndecision that was both \u201ccontrary to\u201d and \u201cinvolved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.\u201d 28 U.

In Graham, we held that granting collat\neral relief to a defendant who had been sentenced to death\nin 1984 would require the announcement of a new rule of\nconstitutional law in contravention of Teague v. Lane, 489\nU. S. 288 (1989). In reaching that conclusion we relied\nheavily on the fact that in 1984 it was reasonable for\njudges to rely on the interpretation of Jurek that the\nplurality had espoused in Franklin. See 506 U. S., at 468\u2013\n472; see also n. 15, supra. But as we have explained, in\nboth Franklin and Penry I, a majority of the Court ulti\nmately rejected the plurality\u2019s interpretation of Jurek.\nNeither Franklin nor Penry I was inconsistent with Gra\nham\u2019s narrow holding, but they do suggest that our later\ndecisions\u2014including Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350\n(1993), in which we refused to adopt the rule that Graham\nsought19\u2014 are of more relevance to Cole\u2019s case than Gra\nham. The relevance of those cases lies not in their re\nsults\u2014in several instances, we concluded, after applying\nthe relevant law, that the special issues provided for\nadequate consideration of the defendant\u2019s mitigating\nevidence20\u2014but in their failure to disturb the basic legal\nprinciple that continues to govern such cases: The jury\nmust have a \u201cmeaningful basis to consider the relevant\nmitigating qualities\u201d of the defendant\u2019s proffered evi\ndence.21 Johnson, 509 U.

S., at 365\u2013366.\n  20 This fact should be reassuring to those who fear that the rule we\n\nendorse today\u2014and which we have endorsed since Penry I\u2014\u201cwould\nrequire a new sentencing in every case.\u201d Post, at 8 (ROBERTS, C. J.,\ndissenting).\n  21 A jury may be precluded from doing so not only as a result of the\n24                ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 474 (explaining that Penry was entitled to addi\ntional instructions \u201c[b]ecause it was impossible [for the\njury] to give meaningful mitigating effect to Penry\u2019s evi\ndence by way of answering the special issues\u201d).\n   Before turning to those more recent cases, it is appro\npriate to identify the reasons why the CCA\u2019s ruling was\nnot a reasonable application of Penry I itself. First, the\nruling ignored the fact that even though Cole\u2019s mitigating\nevidence may not have been as persuasive as Penry\u2019s, it\nwas relevant to the question of Cole\u2019s moral culpability for\nprecisely the same reason as Penry\u2019s. Like Penry\u2019s evi\ndence, Cole\u2019s evidence of childhood deprivation and lack of\nself-control did not rebut either deliberateness or future\ndangerousness but was intended to provide the jury with\nan entirely different reason for not imposing a death\nsentence. Second, the judge\u2019s assumption that it would be\nappropriate to look at \u201cother testimony in the record\u201d to\ndetermine whether the jury could give mitigating effect to\nthe testimony of Cole\u2019s mother and aunt is neither reason\nable nor supported by the Penry opinion. App. 160. Third,\nthe fact that the jury could give mitigating effect to some\nof the experts\u2019 testimony, namely, their predictions that\nCole could be expected to become less dangerous as he\naged, provides no support for the conclusion that the jury\nunderstood it could give such effect to other portions of the\nexperts\u2019 testimony or that of other witnesses. In sum, the\njudge ignored our entire line of cases establishing the\nimportance of allowing juries to give meaningful effect to\nany mitigating evidence providing a basis for a sentence of\nlife rather than death. His recommendation to the CCA\nwas therefore unsupported by either the text or the rea\nsoning in Penry I.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ninstructions it is given, but also as a result of prosecutorial argument \n\ndictating that such consideration is forbidden.

Penry\nI, 492 U. S., at 321, 323 (internal quotation marks omit\nted); Graham, 506 U. S., at 475 (acknowledging that a\n\u201cconstitutional defect\u201d has occurred not only when a jury is\n\u201cprecluded from even considering certain types of mitigat\ning evidence,\u201d but also when \u201cthe defendant\u2019s evidence\n[i]s placed before the sentencer but the sentencer ha[s]\nno reliable means of giving mitigating effect to that\nevidence\u201d).\n   Four of our more recent cases lend support to the con\nclusion that the CCA\u2019s decision was unsupported by either\nthe text or the reasoning of Penry I.22 In Johnson v. Texas,\nwe held that the Texas special issues allowed adequate\nconsideration of petitioner\u2019s youth as a mitigating circum\nstance. Indeed, we thought it \u201cstrain[ed] credulity to\nsuppose that the jury would have viewed the evidence of\npetitioner\u2019s youth as outside its effective reach\u201d because its\nrelevance was so obvious. 509 U. S., at 368. There is of\ncourse a vast difference between youth\u2014a universally\napplicable mitigating circumstance that every juror has\nexperienced and which necessarily is transient\u2014and the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  22 Because THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s only concern is with the proper appli\n\ncation of AEDPA, he finds it unnecessary to define the rule that he\nthinks post-Penry I cases either did or should have applied. What is\nmost relevant under AEDPA, however, is the holdings set forth in\nmajority opinions, rather than the views of dissenters who supported a\ndifferent understanding of the law at the time those opinions were\nwritten.\n26             ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nparticularized childhood experiences of abuse and neglect\nthat Penry I and Cole described\u2014which presumably most\njurors have never experienced and which affect each indi\nvidual in a distinct manner.\n   Evidence of youth, moreover, has special relevance to\nthe question of future dangerousness. A critical assump\ntion motivating the Court\u2019s decision in Johnson was that\njuries would in fact be able to give mitigating effect to the\nevidence, albeit within the confines of the special issues.\nSee 509 U. S., at 370 (\u201cIf any jurors believed that the\ntransient qualities of petitioner\u2019s youth made him less\nculpable for the murder, there is no reasonable likelihood\nthat those jurors would have deemed themselves fore\nclosed from considering that in evaluating petitioner\u2019s\nfuture dangerousness\u201d). Prosecutors in some subsequent\ncases, however, have undermined this assumption, taking\npains to convince jurors that the law compels them to\ndisregard the force of evidence offered in mitigation.\nCole\u2019s prosecution is illustrative: the State made jurors\n\u201cpromise\u201d they would look only at the questions posed by\nthe special issues, which, according to the prosecutor,\nrequired a juror to \u201cput . . . out of [his] mind\u201d Cole\u2019s miti\ngating evidence and \u201cjust go by the facts.\u201d Supra, at 6.\nArguments like these are at odds with the Court\u2019s under\nstanding in Johnson that juries could and would reach\nmitigating evidence proffered by a defendant. Nothing in\nJohnson forecloses relief in these circumstances. See 509\nU. S., at 369 (\u201cPenry remains the law and must be given a\nfair reading\u201d).\n   This conclusion derives further support from the fact\nthat, in Johnson, the Court understood that the defen\ndant\u2019s evidence of youth\u2014including testimony from his\nfather that \u201chis son\u2019s actions were due in large part to his\nyouth,\u201d id., at 368, and counsel\u2019s corresponding arguments\nthat the defendant could change as he grew older\u2014was\n\u201creadily comprehended as a mitigating factor,\u201d id., at 369,\n                    Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                 27\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nin the context of the special issues. The evidence offered\nin this case, however, as well as that offered by the peti\ntioner in Brewer, post, at 2\u20133, and n.1, is closer in nature\nto that offered by the defendant in Penry I than that at\nissue in Johnson. While the consideration of the defen\ndant\u2019s mitigating evidence of youth in Johnson could\neasily have directed jurors towards a \u201cno\u201d answer with\nregard to the question of future dangerousness, a juror\nconsidering Cole\u2019s evidence of childhood neglect and aban\ndonment and possible neurological damage or Brewer\u2019s\nevidence of mental illness, substance abuse, and a trou\nbled childhood could feel compelled to provide a \u201cyes\u201d\nanswer to the same question, finding himself without a\nmeans for giving meaningful effect to the mitigating quali\nties of such evidence.23 In such a case, there is a reason\nable likelihood that the special issues would preclude that\njuror from giving meaningful consideration to such miti\ngating evidence, as required by Penry I. See Johnson, 509\nU. S., at 367 (explaining that in Boyde v. California, 494\nU. S. 370, 380 (1990), \u201cwe held that a reviewing court\nmust determine \u2018whether there is a reasonable likelihood\nthat the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   23 We came to the same conclusion in Graham, after distinguishing\n\nthe defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence in that case from that offered by\nthe defendant in Penry I:\n\u201cThe jury was not forbidden to accept the suggestion of Graham\u2019s\nlawyers that his brief spasm of criminal activity in May 1981 was\nproperly viewed, in light of his youth, his background, and his charac\nter, as an aberration that was not likely to be repeated. Even if Gra\nham\u2019s evidence, like Penry\u2019s, had significance beyond the scope of the\nfirst special issue, it is apparent that Graham\u2019s evidence\u2014unlike\nPenry\u2019s\u2014had mitigating relevance to the second special issue concern\ning his likely future dangerousness. Whereas Penry\u2019s evidence com\npelled an affirmative answer to that inquiry, despite its mitigating\nsignificance, Graham\u2019s evidence quite readily could have supported a\nnegative answer.\u201d 506 U. S., at 475\u2013476.\n28             ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nway that prevents the consideration of constitutionally\nrelevant evidence\u2019 \u201d).\n  In three later cases, we gave Penry I the \u201cfair reading\u201d\nrequired by Johnson and repudiated several Fifth Circuit\nprecedents providing the basis for its narrow reading of\nthat case. First, in our review of Penry\u2019s resentencing, at\nwhich the judge had supplemented the special issues with\na nullification instruction, we again concluded that the\njury had not been provided with an adequate \u201cvehicle for\nexpressing its reasoned moral response\u201d to his mitigating\nevidence. Penry v. Johnson, 532 U. S. 782, 797 (2001)\n(Penry II). Indeed, given that the resentencing occurred\nafter the enactment of AEDPA, we concluded (contrary to\nthe views of the Fifth Circuit, which had denied Penry a\nCOA) that the CCA\u2019s judgment affirming the death sen\ntence was objectively unreasonable. Id., at 803\u2013804.\nSecond, and as we have already noted, in Tennard we held\nthat the Fifth Circuit\u2019s test for identifying relevant miti\ngating evidence was incorrect. 542 U. S., at 284. Most\nrecently, in Smith v. Texas, 543 U. S. 37 (2004) (per cu\nriam), and again contrary to the views of the Fifth Circuit,\nwe held that a nullification instruction that was different\nfrom the one used in Penry\u2019s second sentencing hearing\ndid not foreclose the defendant\u2019s claim that the special\nissues had precluded the jury from \u201cexpressing a \u2018reasoned\nmoral response\u2019 to all of the evidence relevant to the de\nfendant\u2019s culpability.\u201d Id., at 46.\n                            VII\n  Our line of cases in this area has long recognized that\nbefore a jury can undertake the grave task of imposing a\ndeath sentence, it must be allowed to consider a defen\ndant\u2019s moral culpability and decide whether death is an\nappropriate punishment for that individual in light of his\npersonal history and characteristics and the circumstances\n                     Cite as: 550 U.

But a statute that prevents the sentencer\n     in all capital cases from giving independent mitigat\n     ing weight to aspects of the defendant\u2019s character and\n     record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in\n     mitigation creates the risk that the death penalty will\n     be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less\n     severe penalty. When the choice is between life and\n     death, that risk is unacceptable and incompatible\n     with the commands of the Eighth and Fourteenth\n     Amendments.\u201d 438 U. S., at 605.\nOur cases following Lockett have made clear that when the\njury is not permitted to give meaningful effect or a \u201crea\nsoned moral response\u201d to a defendant\u2019s mitigating evi\ndence\u2014because it is forbidden from doing so by statute or\na judicial interpretation of a statute\u2014the sentencing\nprocess is fatally flawed.25 For that reason, our post-Penry\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  24 In Graham, we acknowledged that Penry I did not \u201ceffec[t] a sea\nchange in this Court\u2019s view of the constitutionality of the former Texas\ndeath penalty statute.\u201d Graham, 506 U. S., at 474. The reason, of\ncourse, that this was not the case is because the rule set forth in Penry\nI was merely an application of the settled Lockett-Eddings-Hitchcock\nrule described by Justice O\u2019Connor in her opinions.\n   25 Without making any attempt to explain how the jury in either this\n\ncase or in Brewer v. Quarterman, post, p. __, could have given \u201cmean\ningful effect\u201d or a \u201creasoned moral response\u201d to either defendant\u2019s\nmitigating evidence, THE CHIEF JUSTICE concludes his dissent by\nlamenting the fact that the views shared by Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s concur\nrence and the dissenters in Franklin in 1988\u2014and later endorsed in\nPenry I\u2014\u201cactually represented \u2018clearly established\u2019 federal law at that\ntime. \u201d Post, at 16. To his credit, his concluding sentence does not go so\nfar as to state that he favors a \u201ctunc pro nunc\u201d rejection of those views,\nan endorsement of the views expressed by the four dissenters in Penry\nI, or even agreement with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s recently rejected test for\nidentifying relevant mitigating evidence.

The convictions\nand sentences were upheld on direct review. On state\ncollateral review, each defendant claimed that the jury\ninstructions did not allow sufficient consideration of the\nmitigating evidence. This Court had considered similar\nchallenges to the same instructions no fewer than five\ntimes in the years before the state habeas courts consid\nered the challenges at issue here. See Jurek v. Texas, 428\nU. S. 262 (1976); Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164\n(1988); Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989) (Penry I);\n2              ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nGraham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461 (1993); Johnson v. Texas,\n509 U. S. 350 (1993). Four of the cases rejected the defen\ndant\u2019s challenge. Only one\u2014Penry I\u2014upheld it. The\nguidance the Court gave in these five cases on whether the\njury instructions at issue allowed sufficient consideration\nof mitigating evidence amounted to\u2014it depends. It de\npends on the particular characteristics of the evidence in a\nspecific case. The state courts here rejected the claim as\napplied to the particular mitigating evidence in these\ncases, and the defendants sought federal habeas review.\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), however, a state-court decision can\nbe set aside on federal habeas review only if it is \u201ccontrary\nto, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\nWhen this Court considers similar challenges to the same\njury instructions five separate times, it usually is not\nbecause the applicable legal rules are \u201cclearly estab\nlished.\u201d The Court today nonetheless picks from the five\nprecedents the one that ruled in favor of the defendant\u2014\nPenry I\u2014and anoints that case as the one embodying\n\u201cclearly established Federal law.\u201d In doing so the Court\nfails to give any meaningful weight to the two pertinent\nprecedents subsequent to Penry I\u2014Graham and Johnson\u2014\neven though those cases adopted a more \u201climited view\u201d of\nPenry I than the Court embraces today. Johnson, supra,\nat 365. Indeed, the reading of Penry I in Graham and\nJohnson prompted every one of the remaining Justices\nwho had been in the majority in Penry I on the pertinent\nquestion to dissent in Graham and Johnson, on the\nground that the Court was failing to adhere to Penry I.\n   I suppose the Court today is free to ignore the import of\nGraham and Johnson on the question of what Penry I\nmeans, but in 1999 or 2001, respectively\u2014when petition\ners were denied collateral relief\u2014the state courts did not\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

They should not be faulted today for\nconcluding\u2014exactly as the Graham and Johnson dissent\ners did\u2014that the Court had cut back significantly on\nPenry I.\n   We give ourselves far too much credit in claiming that\nour sharply divided, ebbing and flowing decisions in this\narea gave rise to \u201cclearly established\u201d federal law. If the\nlaw were indeed clearly established by our decisions \u201cas of\nthe time of the relevant state-court decision,\u201d Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000), it should not take the\nCourt more than a dozen pages of close analysis of plural\nity, concurring, and even dissenting opinions to explain\nwhat that \u201cclearly established\u201d law was. Ante, at 10\u201324.\nWhen the state courts considered these cases, our prece\ndents did not provide them with \u201cclearly established\u201d law,\nbut instead a dog\u2019s breakfast of divided, conflicting, and\never-changing analyses. That is how the Justices on this\nCourt viewed the matter, as they shifted from being in the\nmajority, plurality, concurrence, or dissent from case to\ncase, repeatedly lamenting the failure of their colleagues\nto follow a consistent path. Whatever the law may be\ntoday, the Court\u2019s ruling that \u2019twas always so\u2014and that\nstate courts were \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d not to know\nit, Williams, supra, at 409\u2014is utterly revisionist.\n                              I\n  In 1987, Jalil Abdul-Kabir\u2014referred to by his given\nname, Ted Calvin Cole, throughout this opinion, ante, at 1,\nn. 1\u2014was convicted of capital murder after he confessed to\nstrangling 66-year-old Raymond Richardson with a dog\nleash to steal $20 from him. Among the 21 claims Cole\nraised on state collateral review was a challenge under\nPenry I, 492 U. S. 302, to the application of Texas\u2019s special\nissue jury instructions. In evaluating Cole\u2019s challenge, the\nstate habeas trial court stated:\n      \u201cThe issue is whether the sentencing jury had been\n4              ABDUL-KABIR v.

Collins, [506 U. S. 461] (1993), Garcia v.\n    State, 919 S. W. 2d 370 (1996), Mines v. State, 888\n    S. W. 2d 816 (1994), and Zimmerman v. State, 881\n    S. W. 2d 360 (1994) held that the mitigating evidence\n    of alcoholism, drug abuse, bad family background, bi\n    polar disorder, low I.Q., substance abuse, head injury,\n    paranoid personality disorder and child abuse were\n    sufficiently considered under the special issues. The\n    issue of whether the mitigating evidence can be suffi\n    ciently considered must be determined on a case by\n    case basis, depending on the nature of the mitigating\n    evidence offered and whether there exists other testi\n    mony in the record that would allow consideration to\n    be given.\u201d App. in No. 05\u201311284, pp. 159\u2013160.\n   Applying that standard, the state court concluded that\n\u201c[t]he evidence presented at the punishment stage of the\ntrial, especially evidence from [Cole\u2019s] expert witnesses,\nprovide[d] a basis for the jury to sufficiently consider the\nmitigating evidence.\u201d Id., at 161.

The only thing clear about our jurisprudence\non the pertinent question in 1999, however, is that it was\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nunsettled and confused.\n   In Jurek, the Court upheld Texas\u2019s use of the special\nissues as facially constitutional, with the controlling opin\nion noting that \u201cthe constitutionality of the Texas proce\ndures turns on whether the enumerated questions allow\nconsideration of particularized mitigating factors.\u201d 428\nU. S., at 272 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and\nSTEVENS, JJ.). In so doing, Jurek left open the possibility\nthat some mitigating evidence might not be within the\nreach of the jury under the special issues; other types of\nmitigating evidence, of course, would be. Cf. id., at 272\u2013\n273 (suggesting that the future dangerousness special\nissue allowed the jury to consider prior criminal conduct,\nage, duress, and whether the defendant was under ex\ntreme mental pressure).\n   The next occasion the Court had to consider mitigating\nevidence under the Texas special issues arose in Franklin,\nin which the Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s mitigat\ning evidence of good behavior in prison was taken into\naccount under the future dangerousness special issue. 487\nU. S., at 178\u2013179 (plurality opinion); id., at 186\u2013187\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment). A plurality of the\nCourt also rejected the argument that a jury must be\npermitted to give \u201cindependent\u201d effect to mitigating evi\ndence\u2014beyond the special issues\u2014concluding that \u201cthis\nsubmission is foreclosed by Jurek\u201d and rejecting the dis\nsent\u2019s argument to the contrary. Id., at 179\u2013180, and\nn. 10; see also id., at 199\u2013200 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n   The Court today places great weight on the opinion by\nJustice O\u2019Connor concurring in the judgment in Franklin,\nan opinion joined only by Justice Blackmun. Ante, at 15\u2013\n18. That separate opinion expressed \u201cdoubts\u201d about the\nplurality\u2019s view that mitigating evidence need not be given\neffect beyond the special issues, noting that if the peti\ntioner in Franklin had introduced evidence not covered by\nthe special issues, \u201cwe would have to decide whether the\n6              ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\njury\u2019s inability to give effect to that evidence amounted to\nan Eighth Amendment violation.\u201d 487 U. S., at 183, 185.\nThe separate opinion concluded, however, that \u201cthis is not\nsuch a case.\u201d Id., at 185. According to the Court today, a\ndiscerning state judge should have seen that federal law\nwas \u201cclearly established\u201d on the point by the concurring\nand dissenting opinions, not the plurality. Ante, at 15\u201318.\n   Penry I, decided the following Term, concluded that in\nthat case the Texas instructions did not allow the jury to\ngive mitigating effect to evidence of Penry\u2019s mental retar\ndation and abusive childhood. 492 U. S., at 328, 315\n(\u201cPenry does not . . . dispute that some types of mitigating\nevidence can be fully considered by the sentencer in the\nabsence of special jury instructions. Instead, Penry argues\nthat, on the facts of this case, the jury was unable to fully\nconsider and give effect to the mitigating evidence . . . in\nanswering the three special issues\u201d (emphasis added;\ncitations omitted)). In granting relief, the Court, quoting\nthe Franklin concurrence, noted that Penry\u2019s evidence\n\u201c \u2018had relevance to [his] moral culpability beyond the scope\nof the special verdict questions,\u2019 \u201d 492 U. S., at 322 (quot\ning 487 U. S., at 185 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judg\nment); some alterations deleted), and that it was relevant\nto the special issues \u201conly as an aggravating factor.\u201d 492\nU. S., at 323 (emphasis in original). According to the\nCourt today, the views of the Franklin concurrence and\ndissent were thus elevated to the opinion of the Court in\nPenry I, again clearly establishing federal law. Ante, at\n17\u201318, and n. 15. The four dissenters in Penry I com\nplained that the Court\u2019s holding \u201cflatly contradic[ted]\u201d\nJurek, and that in finding a constitutional violation, the\nCourt was \u201cthrowing away Jurek in the process.\u201d 492\nU.

That case\u2014issued less than nine months after\nPenry I\u2014considered Oklahoma instructions, but exten\nsively analyzed Penry I in doing so. See 494 U. S., at 491\u2013\n492. The Court concluded that the mitigating evidence in\nthat case could be adequately considered by the jury under\nthe instructions given. The four dissenters in Saffle\u2014\nincluding the author of today\u2019s opinion\u2014complained that\nthe majority\u2019s discussion of Penry I was \u201cstrangely remi\nniscent\u201d of the position of the Penry I dissenters. 494\nU. S., at 504 (opinion of Brennan, J.). The Saffle dissent\ners asserted that the majority\u2019s failure to reject the posi\ntion of the Penry I dissenters \u201ccreates considerable ambi\nguity about which Lockett [v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978)]\nclaims a federal court may hereafter consider on habeas\ncorpus review.\u201d 494 U. S., at 504\u2013505.\n   In Graham, decided three years later, the Court sought\nto clarify the interplay between Jurek, Franklin, and\nPenry I:\n    \u201cIt seems to us, however, that reading Penry as peti\n    tioner urges\u2014and thereby holding that a defendant is\n    entitled to special instructions whenever he can offer\n    mitigating evidence that has some arguable relevance\n    beyond the special issues\u2014would be to require in all\n    cases that a fourth \u2018special issue\u2019 be put to the jury:\n    \u2018 \u201cDoes any mitigating evidence before you, whether or\n    not relevant to the above [three] questions, lead you to\n    believe that the death penalty should not be im\n    posed?\u201d \u2019 The Franklin plurality rejected precisely this\n    contention, finding it irreconcilable with the Court\u2019s\n    holding in Jurek, and we affirm that conclusion to\n    day.\u201d 506 U. S., at 476\u2013477 (citation omitted; second\n    emphasis added).\nThus, in Graham the Court rejected the reading of Frank\nlin and Penry I that the Court today endorses, reasoning\n8                  ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthat it would require a new sentencing in every case, and\nwould be impossible to square with Jurek.1\n   Although the Court today tells us it was clear that the\napplicable federal law was established by the Franklin\nconcurrence and dissent, and that Penry I had to be read\nin that light, ante, at 17\u201318, the Court majority in Gra\nham specifically relied instead upon the Franklin plurality\nin rejecting the same broad reading of Penry I the Court\nresuscitates today, nunc pro tunc. Graham, supra, at 476\u2013\n477. The dissenters in Graham\u2014including every remain\ning Member of the Penry I majority\u2014were adamant that\nPenry I should have been controlling in Graham. See, e.g.,\n506 U. S., at 507 (opinion of SOUTER, J., joined by Black\nmun, STEVENS, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.) (\u201cOur description of\nPenry\u2019s claim applies . . . almost precisely to Graham\u2019s\nclaim\u201d); id., at 508 (\u201c[Graham\u2019s] position is identical to\nthat of Penry\u201d); id., at 512 (\u201cPenry controls in this respect,\nand we should adhere to it\u201d); id., at 520 (\u201c[T]he case is\ncontrolled by Penry\u201d). The issue is not whether the major\nity or the dissenters in Graham were right about how to\nread Penry I, but whether it was reasonable for a state\ncourt in 1999 to read it the way the majority in Graham\nplainly did.\n   Later the same Term, in Johnson, the Court reaffirmed\nthe \u201climited view of Penry\u201d it had adopted in Graham. 509\nU. S., at 365. Once again the Court majority specifically\nrelied on the Franklin plurality\u2014not the concurrence and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In evaluating the state court\u2019s analysis, the Court criticizes its reli\n\nance on Graham because Graham primarily addressed retroactivity\nunder Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Ante, at 23. But in consid\nering whether the rule requested was dictated by precedent, Graham of\ncourse had to evaluate the scope of that precedent\u2014including Penry I\u2014\nand did so extensively. See 506 U. S., at 467\u2013477. Moreover, as ex\nplained below, the Court in Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 370\u2013372\n(1993), adopted the same reading of Penry I adopted in Graham,\nwithout considering the issue under Teague.\n                  Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ndissent. See 509 U. S., at 370\u2013371. And once again the\ndissenters\u2014including every remaining Member of the\nPenry I majority\u2014lamented the Court\u2019s asserted failure to\nadhere to Penry I. 509 U. S., at 385\u2013386 (opinion of\nO\u2019Connor, J., joined by Blackmun, STEVENS, and SOUTER,\nJJ.). The dissent\u2014by the Penry I author\u2014made precisely\nthe same point made by the Court today about how to read\nthe Franklin concurrence and dissent. 509 U. S., at 385\u2013\n386. The difference, of course, was that in Johnson the\npoint was made in dissent. It cannot have been \u201cobjec\ntively unreasonable\u201d for a state court, in 1999, to have\nbeen guided by the Johnson majority on this question,\nrather than by the dissent.\n   In short, a state court reading our opinions would see an\nongoing debate over the meaning and significance of Penry\nI. That state court would see four dissenters in Graham\nand Johnson\u2014including every remaining Member of the\nPenry I majority\u2014arguing that the Court was failing to\nfollow or sharply limiting Penry I in those cases. On the\nflip side, the state court would see four dissenters in Penry\nI\u2014every one later joining the majorities in Graham and\nJohnson\u2014suggesting that the Penry I majority departed\nfrom Jurek. It is in that context that the Court today tells\nus that the state courts should have regarded Penry I as\n\u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court of the United States.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   The Court asserts that Graham and Johnson did not\n\u201cdisturb the basic legal principle\u201d at issue, ante, at 23, and\nthat we cite no post-Penry I cases inconsistent with its\nreading of that case, ante, at 17, n. 14. I do not under\nstand how the author of today\u2019s opinion can say that Gra\nham did not disturb the principle of Penry I, however,\nwhen he joined a dissent in Graham stating that \u201c[Gra\nham\u2019s] position is identical to that of Penry\u201d and that\nGraham\u2019s case \u201cis controlled by Penry.\u201d 506 U. S., at 508,\n520 (opinion of SOUTER, J.) (emphasis added). That would\n10                 ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nseem to suggest that Graham was inconsistent with Penry\nI. I do not understand how the author of today\u2019s opinion\ncan say that Johnson had no effect on Penry I, when he\njoined a dissent in Johnson stating that the majority\nopinion \u201cupset our settled Eighth Amendment jurispru\ndence.\u201d 509 U. S., at 382 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.). Now\nJohnson is dismissed as just an application of \u201cbasic legal\nprinciple[s],\u201d over which Justices can disagree, ante, at 23;\nback then it \u201cupset our settled Eighth Amendment juris\nprudence.\u201d And what of Saffle? There the author of to\nday\u2019s opinion joined a dissent claiming that the majority\nwas adopting the rule rejected in Penry I. 494 U. S., at\n504 (opinion of Brennan, J.). Again, that would seem to\nsuggest inconsistency with Penry I.2\n   In fact, Penry I is not even consistent with the reading\nthe Court ascribes to it\u2014in that case the Court concluded\nthat a jury could only view Penry\u2019s mitigating evidence as\naggravating, and thus could not give the evidence any\nmitigating effect. 492 U. S., at 323 (Penry\u2019s evidence was\n\u201crelevant only as an aggravating factor\u201d (emphasis in\noriginal)); see also Graham, supra, at 473 (\u201cAlthough\nPenry\u2019s evidence of mental impairment and childhood\nabuse indeed had relevance to the \u2018future dangerousness\u2019\ninquiry, its relevance was aggravating only\u201d (emphasis in\noriginal)). The Court concedes that Cole\u2019s evidence in the\npresent case was not purely aggravating, see ante, at 24\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n     2 The   Court is correct that \u201c[w]hat is most relevant under AEDPA\n. . . is the holdings set forth in majority opinions, rather than the views\nof dissenters . . . at the time those opinions were written.\u201d Ante, at 25,\nn. 22. But that must include the majority opinions in all the pertinent\ncases, not just the lone one of the bunch that ruled in favor of the\ndefendant. Here it must include the subsequent majority opinions in\nSaffle, Graham, and Johnson, as well as in Penry I, and it was not\nobjectively unreasonable for a state court to view Saffle, Graham, and\nJohnson the same way today\u2019s author did at the time\u2014or at least to\nconclude that the Court\u2019s current view of Penry I was not as clearly\nestablished as the Court would have it today.\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

S., at 328, but that evidence of\nyouth and a transient upbringing could be, Graham, 506\nU. S., at 476; Johnson, 509 U. S., at 368. The court con\ncluded that Cole\u2019s mitigating evidence\u2014a troubled child\nhood and \u201cimpulse control\u201d disorder\u2014was more like that\nconsidered in Johnson and Graham than in Penry I. And\nbecause Cole\u2019s mitigating evidence was not as troubling as\nthat at issue in Penry I, the state court did not act unrea\nsonably in concluding that the collateral damage of his\nupbringing and impulse control disorder would, like youth\nin Johnson, dissipate over time, so that Cole would be less\nof a danger in the future. It is irrelevant that the ill ef\nfects of Cole\u2019s upbringing and impulse control disorder\nmight not wear off for some time\u2014there was no suggestion\nin Johnson that the petitioner in that case would become\nless dangerous any time soon.\n  In other words, our precedents\u2014which confirmed that\nthe permanence of a mitigating feature was highly rele\nvant, and that the correct answer was a case-specific\nmatter turning on the particular facts\u2014did not provide a\nclear answer, because the particular evidence before the\ncourt fell somewhere between the guideposts established\nby those precedents. As we have recognized, \u201cthe range of\nreasonable judgment can depend in part on the nature of\nthe relevant rule. . . .

We see no\n    reason to regard the circumstances of Graham\u2019s fam\n    ily background and positive character traits in a dif\n    ferent light. Graham\u2019s evidence of transient upbring\n    ing and otherwise nonviolent character more closely\n    resembles Jurek\u2019s evidence of age, employment his\n    tory, and familial ties than it does Penry\u2019s evidence of\n    mental retardation and harsh physical abuse.\u201d 506\n    U. S., at 476.\nThe state court thought that Cole\u2019s evidence \u201cmore closely\nresemble[d]\u201d Johnson and Graham than Penry I. That\ncannot be said to be \u201ccontrary to, or . . . an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d\n\u00a72254(d)(1). See Brown, supra, at 143, 147; Williams, 529\nU.

At the time the state court ruled,\nhowever, Graham and Johnson, decided after Penry I, had\nexpressly rejected the notion that a jury must \u201cbe able to\ngive effect to mitigating evidence in every conceivable\nmanner in which the evidence might be relevant,\u201d so long\nas the jury could consider \u201cin some manner all of a defen\ndant\u2019s relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d Johnson, supra, at\n14                 ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n372\u2013373. The state court found that Cole\u2019s mitigating\nevidence could be \u201csufficiently consider[ed]\u201d by the jury\n\u201cwithin the confines of the statutory \u2018special issues,\u2019 \u201d App.\nin No. 05\u201311284, at 161, 159, a holding consistent with\nthis Court\u2019s precedents as of 1999\u2014and certainly not\ncontrary to clearly established federal law.\n  In reaching today\u2019s result, the Court also takes advan\ntage of eight years of hindsight and relies on three cases\nthat postdate the state court\u2019s ruling. Ante, at 28 (citing\nPenry v. Johnson, 532 U. S. 782 (2001) (Penry II), Tennard\nv. Dretke, 542 U. S. 274 (2004), and Smith v. Texas, 543\nU. S. 37 (2004) (per curiam)). What is pertinent under\nAEDPA, however, is whether federal law was clearly\nestablished by our decisions when the state court acted.\nWilliams, supra, at 412.3 AEDPA requires state courts to\nreasonably apply clearly established federal law. It does\nnot require them to have a crystal ball.\n                              II\n  In 1991, petitioner Brent Ray Brewer was convicted of\nmurder committed during the course of a robbery. Like\nCole, Brewer claims that the Texas special issues pre\nvented the jury from giving effect to mitigating evidence\nthat he suffered from depression and had been abused as a\nteenager. The Texas courts rejected these claims on both\ndirect and collateral review.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Court criticizes this dissent for failing \u201cto define the rule\u201d that\nour post-Penry I cases either did or should have applied. Ante, at 25, n.\n22. But the whole point is that \u201cthe rule,\u201d far from being \u201cclearly\nestablished\u201d by our decisions, was\u2014at the very least\u2014unsettled and\nconfused. Under AEDPA, those defending the finality of a state-court\njudgment challenged on federal habeas review do not have to show that\nthe state-court judgment was consistent with some version of \u201cclearly\nestablished Federal law\u201d other than that offered by the challenger;\nAEDPA obviously contemplates that there may not be \u201cclearly estab\nlished Federal law.\u201d The Court\u2019s criticism only underscores how far the\nreasoning employed today strays from AEDPA\u2019s mandate.\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           15\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   In evaluating Brewer\u2019s claim, the Court focuses on the\nso-called \u201ctwo-edged sword\u201d nature of the evidence found\nto be beyond the jury\u2019s reach in Penry I, and concludes\nthat Brewer\u2019s mitigating evidence is similarly double\nedged. The state court distinguished Penry I, however,\nstating that \u201ca stay in a mental hospital does not evidence\na long term mental illness which would affect appellant\u2019s\nability to conform to the requirements of society,\u201d App. in\nNo. 05\u201311287, p. 141 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nin contrast to Penry\u2019s \u201corganic brain disorder . . . which\nmade it impossible for him to appreciate the wrongfulness\nof his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law,\u201d Penry\nI, 492 U. S., at 309. The state court determined that the\nnature of Brewer\u2019s evidence allowed the jury to find that\nhe would not be a future danger, whereas Penry\u2019s did not.\n   The Court rejects this distinction, noting that while\nBrewer\u2019s mitigating evidence may have been less compel\nling than Penry\u2019s, \u201cthat difference does not provide an\nacceptable justification for refusing to apply the reasoning\nin Penry I to this case.\u201d Ante, at 6, and n. 5. This misses\nthe point. The state court\u2019s distinction goes not to the\nrelative strength of the mitigating evidence, but rather its\ncharacter\u2014an episodic rather than permanent mental\ndisorder. As discussed in the context of Cole, see supra, at\n12, the distinction was not a \u201crefus[al] to apply the reason\ning in Penry I,\u201d ante, at 6, but rather an application of\nPenry I that can hardly be said to be \u201cobjectively unrea\nsonable\u201d based on this Court\u2019s decisions as of 2001. In\ndeed, in considering future dangerousness, it is difficult to\nimagine a more pertinent distinction than whether a\nmental condition is or is not permanent.\n   The Court concedes that \u201c[t]he transient quality of\n[Brewer\u2019s] mitigating evidence may make it more likely to\nfall in part within the ambit of the special issues,\u201d and yet\nstill finds the state court\u2019s decision unreasonable because\nthe evidence may have had relevance beyond the special\n16            ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nissues. Ante, at 7. As in Cole\u2019s case, this conclusion\nsquarely conflicts with the Court\u2019s rejection in Graham of\nthe proposition that \u201ca defendant is entitled to special\ninstructions whenever he can offer mitigating evidence\nthat has some arguable relevance beyond the special\nissues.\u201d 506 U. S., at 476 (emphasis in original). That\nrejection was confirmed in Johnson, see 509 U. S., at 372\u2013\n373 (rejecting a rule that \u201cwould require that a jury be\nable to give effect to mitigating evidence in every conceiv\nable manner in which the evidence might be relevant\u201d in\nfavor of the rule \u201cthat a jury be able to consider in some\nmanner all of a defendant\u2019s relevant mitigating evidence\u201d).\nOnce again, the Court rejects the state court\u2019s reasonable\nreading of existing cases in favor of its own revisionist\nreading of this Court\u2019s doctrine, heavily informed by sub\nsequent decisions that the state court had no means to\npredict.\n                              III\n   In AEDPA, Congress \u201cwork[ed] substantial changes\u201d to\nthe power of federal courts to grant habeas corpus relief.\nFelker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 654 (1996). In today\u2019s\ndecisions, the Court trivializes AEDPA\u2019s requirements and\noverturns decades-old sentences on the ground that they\nwere contrary to clearly established federal law at the\ntime\u2014even though the same Justices who form the major\nity today were complaining at that time that this Court\nwas changing that \u201cclearly established\u201d law.\n   Still, perhaps there is no reason to be unduly glum.\nAfter all, today the author of a dissent issued in 1988\nwrites two majority opinions concluding that the views\nexpressed in that dissent actually represented \u201cclearly\nestablished\u201d federal law at that time. So there is hope yet\nfor the views expressed in this dissent, not simply down\nthe road, but tunc pro nunc. Encouraged by the majority\u2019s\ndetermination that the future can change the past, I re\nspectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

That is all\n2              ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwhich is needful to demonstrate the error of today\u2019s judg\nments. The full truth is worse than that, however. There\nwas in fact clearly established law that governed these\ncases, and it favored the State. When the state courts\nrendered their decisions, Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350\n(1993), was this Court\u2019s most recent pronouncement on the\nTexas special issues. And in that case, the Court unambi\nguously drew back from the broader implications of its\nprior decision in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989)\n(Penry I). Reiterating what it had recently said in Gra\nham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 475 (1993), the Court made\nclear that \u201c \u2018[i]n Penry, the defendant\u2019s evidence was\nplaced before the sentencer but the sentencer had no\nreliable means of giving mitigating effect to that evi\ndence.\u2019 \u201d Johnson, supra, at 366 (emphasis added). Penry\nI, said Johnson, stood for the proposition that habeas\nrelief was appropriate where jurors had been unable to\ngive any mitigating effect to the evidence at issue. 509\nU. S., at 369; see also Graham, supra, at 475. Penry I in\nno way meant to imply, Johnson warned, \u201cthat a jury\n[must] be able to give effect to mitigating evidence in every\nconceivable manner in which the evidence might be rele\nvant.\u201d 509 U. S., at 372 (emphasis added). Johnson thus\nestablished, in no uncertain terms, that jurors need only\n\u201cbe able to consider in some manner all of a defendant\u2019s\nrelevant mitigating evidence.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added); see\ngenerally id., at 372\u2013373.\n   The dissenters in Johnson very much disagreed with\nthat analysis. They read Penry I for the more expansive\nproposition that \u201cthe Texas special issues violated the\nEighth Amendment to the extent they prevented the jury\nfrom giving full consideration and effect to a defendant\u2019s\nrelevant mitigating evidence.\u201d 509 U. S., at 385 (opinion\nof O\u2019Connor, J.) (citing Penry I, supra; emphasis added\nand deleted). \u201c[H]aving some relevance to [a special]\nissue,\u201d the dissent said, \u201cwas not sufficient.\u201d 509 U.

And because youth (the mitigating feature in John\nson) had obvious relevance beyond the special issues, an\nadditional instruction was needed. Id., at 375. The differ\nences between the Johnson majority and dissenters could\nnot have been more pronounced.\n   Today the Court overrules Johnson sub silentio, and\nreinstates the \u201cfull effect\u201d interpretation of Penry I. For as\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE explains, ante, at 12, 15 (dissenting\nopinion), it was not objectively unreasonable for the state\ncourts to conclude that the ill effects of petitioners\u2019 mental\nillnesses and difficult childhoods would wear off in due\ntime, allowing the jury to give that mitigating evidence\nsome effect through the future dangerousness instruc\ntion\u2014just as could be done for the mitigating factor of\nyouth in Johnson. The Court nonetheless reverses these\nsentences because the juries were unable to give effect to\n\u201cany independent concern\u201d (independent, that is, of the\nTexas special issues) that the defendants \u201cmay not be\ndeserving of a death sentence,\u201d Brewer, ante, at 6, or to\nconsider the evidence\u2019s \u201crelevance to the defendant\u2019s moral\nculpability beyond the scope of the special verdict ques\ntions,\u201d id., at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nCourt does not acknowledge that it is overruling Johnson,\nbut makes the Court of Appeals the scapegoat for its\nchange of heart.\n   The Fifth Circuit in both of these cases relied heavily on\nJohnson when denying relief. See Cole v. Dretke, 418\nF. 3d 494, 505 (2005); Brewer v. Dretke, 442 F. 3d 273, 278,\n281 (2006) (relying on Cole). How does the Court manage\nto distinguish it? The Court tries two main lines of argu\nment. First, the Court explains:\n    \u201cA critical assumption motivating the Court\u2019s decision\n    in Johnson was that juries would in fact be able to\n    give mitigating effect to the evidence, albeit within\n    the confines of the special issues. . . . Prosecutors in\n4                ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n     some subsequent cases, however, have undermined\n     this assumption, taking pains to convince jurors that\n     the law compels them to disregard the force of evi\n     dence offered in mitigation.\u201d Abdul-Kabir, ante, at 26.\nBecause Johnson\u2019s \u201ccritical assumption\u201d has now been\n\u201cundermined,\u201d the Court says, Johnson cannot be said to\n\u201cforeclos[e] relief in these circumstances.\u201d Abdul-Kabir,\nante, at 26.\n   This attempt to \u201cdistinguish\u201d Johnson wilts under even\nthe mildest scrutiny. Since when does this Court craft\nconstitutional rules that depend on the beneficence of the\nprosecutor? (Never mind that this \u201ccritical assumption\u201d of\nJohnson was not so critical as to be mentioned in the\ncase.) And more importantly, how can prosecutorial style\nhave any bearing on whether the Eighth Amendment\nrequires a jury to be able to give \u201csome effect,\u201d as opposed\nto \u201cfull effect,\u201d to a defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence? It is\nof course true that a prosecutor\u2019s arguments may be rele\nvant evidence in the final analysis of whether a capital\ntrial has met the \u201csome effect\u201d test. But it has absolutely\nno relevance to which test is selected in the first place.*\n   Second, the Court explains that \u201cthe consideration of the\ndefendant\u2019s mitigating evidence of youth in Johnson could\neasily have directed jurors towards a \u2018no\u2019 answer with\nregard to the question of future dangerousness,\u201d whereas\na juror considering petitioners\u2019 mitigating evidence \u201ccould\nfeel compelled to provide a \u2018yes\u2019 answer to the same ques\ntion.\u201d Abdul-Kabir, ante, at 27. But it is quite apparent\nthat jurors considering youth in Johnson could also have\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  *Relatedly, the Court thinks Johnson distinguishable because jurors\nhave \u201cexperienced\u201d youth but \u201chave never experienced\u201d the \u201cparticular\nized childhood experiences of abuse and neglect\u201d at issue here. Abdul-\nKabir, ante, at 25\u201326. It is again quite impossible to understand,\nhowever, how that can have any bearing upon whether \u201csome effect\u201d or\n\u201cfull effect\u201d is the required test.\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cfe[lt] compelled to provide a \u2018yes\u2019 answer\u201d to the future\ndangerousness question. While one can believe that \u201cthe\nimpetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in\nyounger years can subside,\u201d Johnson, 509 U. S., at 368,\none can also believe that a person who kills even in his\nyounger years is fundamentally depraved, and more prone\nto a life of violent crime. Johnson itself explicitly recog\nnized this point, denying relief despite \u201cthe fact that a\njuror might view the evidence of youth as aggravating, as\nopposed to mitigating.\u201d Ibid.\n   As the Court\u2019s opinion effectively admits, nothing of a\nlegal nature has changed since Johnson. What has\nchanged are the moral sensibilities of the majority of the\nCourt. For those in Texas who have already received the\nultimate punishment, this judicial moral awakening\ncomes too late. Johnson was the law, until today. And in\nthe almost 15 years in-between, the Court today tells us,\nstate and lower federal courts in countless appeals, and\nthis Court in numerous denials of petitions for writ of\ncertiorari, have erroneously relied on Johnson to allow the\ncondemned to be taken to the death chamber. See, e.g.,\nRobison v. Johnson, 151 F. 3d 256, 269 (CA5 1998) (deny\ning petition for rehearing), cert. denied, 526 U. S. 1100\n(1999) (petitioner executed Jan. 21, 2000); Motley v.\nCollins, 18 F. 3d 1223, 1233\u20131235 (CA5), cert. denied\nsub nom. Motley v. Scott, 513 U. S. 960 (1994) (petitioner\nexecuted Feb. 7, 1995).\n                             II\n   The individuals duly tried and executed between John\nson and today\u2019s decisions were not, in my view (my view at\nthe time of Johnson, and my view now), entitled to federal\njudicial invalidation of their state-imposed sentences.\nThat is because in my view the meaning of the Eighth\nAmendment is to be determined not by the moral percep\ntions of the Justices du jour, but by the understanding of\n6              ABDUL-KABIR v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe American people who adopted it\u2014which understand\ning did not remotely include any requirement that a capi\ntal jury be permitted to consider all mitigating factors. If,\nhowever, a majority of the Justices are going to govern us\nby their moral perceptions, in this area at least they ought\nto get their moral perceptions right the first time.\nWhether one regards improvised death-is-different juris\nprudence with disdain or with approval, no one can be at\nease with the stark reality that this Court\u2019s vacillating\npronouncements have produced grossly inequitable treat\nment of those on death row. Relief from sentence of death\nbecause of the jury\u2019s inability to give \u201cfull effect\u201d to all\nmitigating factors has been made available only to those\nwho have managed to drag out their habeas proceedings\nuntil today. This is not justice. It is caprice.\n",

Eldred, Austin, Texas, for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Jalil Abdul-Kabir, formerly known as Ted Calvin Cole,<sup>[1]</sup> contends that there is a reasonable likelihood that the trial judge's instructions to the Texas jury that sentenced him to death prevented jurors from giving meaningful consideration to constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence. He further contends that the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) denying his application for postconviction relief on November 24, 1999, misapplied the law as clearly established by earlier decisions of this Court, thereby warranting relief under the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We agree with both contentions. Although the relevant state-court judgment for purposes of our review under AEDPA is that adjudicating the merits of Cole's state habeas application, in which these claims were properly raised, we are persuaded that the same result would be dictated by those cases decided before the state trial court entered its judgment affirming Cole's death sentence on September 26, 1990. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In December 1987, Cole, his stepbrother Michael Hickey, and Michael's wife, Kelly, decided to rob and kill Kelly's grandfather, Raymond Richardson, to obtain some cash. Two days later they did so. Cole strangled Richardson with a dog leash; the group then searched the house and found $20 that they used to purchase beer and food. The next day, Michael and Kelly surrendered to the police and confessed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1660</span> The police then arrested Cole who also confessed.</p>\n<p>Cole was tried by a jury and convicted of capital murder. After a sentencing hearing, the jury was asked to answer two special issues:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Was the conduct of the defendant, TED CALVIN COLE, that caused the death of the deceased, RAYMOND C. RICHARDSON, committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Is there a probability that the defendant, TED CALVIN COLE, would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society?\" App. 127-128.<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>The trial judge instructed the jury to take into consideration evidence presented at the guilt phase as well as the sentencing phase of the trial but made no reference to mitigating evidence. Under the provisions of the Texas criminal code, the jury's affirmative answers to these two special issues required the judge to impose a death sentence. See Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071 (Vernon 2006).</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, the State introduced evidence that Cole pleaded guilty to an earlier murder when he was only 16. Shortly after being released on parole, Cole pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated sexual assault on two boys and was sentenced to 15 more years in prison. As evidence of Cole's propensity for future dangerousness, the State introduced Cole's diary which, according to the State's expert psychiatrist, Dr. Richard Coons, revealed a compulsive attraction to young boys and an obsession with criminal activity. Dr. Coons described Cole as a sociopath who lacked remorse and would not profit or learn from his experiences.</p>\n<p>In response, Cole presented two categories of mitigating evidence. The first consisted of testimony from his mother and his aunt, who described his unhappy childhood. Cole's parents lived together \"off and on\" for 10 years, over the course of which they had two children, Cole, and his younger sister, Carla. App. 35. Shortly after Cole was born, his father was arrested for robbing a liquor store. Cole's father deserted the family several times, abandoning the family completely before Cole was five years old. On the last occasion that Cole saw his father, he dropped Cole off a block from where he thought Cole's mother lived, told Cole to \"go find her,\" and drove off. <i>Id.,</i> at 42. Cole had no contact with his father during the next 10 years. <i>Ibid.</i> After Cole's father left, his mother found herself unable to care for Cole and his sister and took the children to live with her parents in Oklahoma. Cole's grandparents were both alcoholics\u0097Cole's mother was herself a self-described \"drunk\"\u0097and lived miles away from other children. Eventually, because Cole's grandparents did not want their daughter or her children living with them, Cole's mother placed him in a church-run children's home, although she kept her daughter with her. Over the next five years <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1661</span> Cole's mother visited him only twice. Cole's aunt, who visited him on holidays, testified that Cole seemed incapable of expressing any emotion and that his father never visited him at all.</p>\n<p>The second category of mitigating evidence came from two expert witnesses\u0097a psychologist and the former chief mental health officer for the Texas Department of Corrections\u0097who discussed the consequences of Cole's childhood neglect and abandonment. Dr. Jarvis Wright, the psychologist, spent 8 to 10 hours interviewing Cole and administering an \"extensive battery of psychological tests.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 63. He testified that Cole had \"real problems with impulse control\" apparently resulting from \"central nervous damage\" combined with \"all the other factors of [his] background.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 69. He also testified that Cole had likely been depressed for much of his life, that he had a \"painful\" background, and that he had \"never felt loved and worthwhile in his life.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 73, 86. Providing an analogy for Cole's early development, Dr. Wright stated that \"the manufacturing process [had] botched the raw material horribly.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 73.</p>\n<p>When specifically asked about future dangerousness, Dr. Wright acknowledged that \"if Ted were released today on the street, there's a much greater probability of dangerous behavior than with the rest of us.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 74. Although he acknowledged the possibility of change or \"burn out,\" he admitted that Cole would likely pose a threat of future dangerousness until \"years from now.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Except for his prediction that Cole would change as he grew older, Dr. Wright's testimony did not contradict the State's claim that Cole was a dangerous person, but instead sought to provide an explanation for his behavior that might reduce his moral culpability.</p>\n<p>Dr. Wendell Dickerson, a psychologist who had not previously examined Cole, observed that it was difficult to predict future dangerousness, but that \"violent conduct is predominantly, overwhelmingly the province of the young\" with the risk of violence becoming rare as people grow older. <i>Id.,</i> at 95. On cross-examination, in response to a hypothetical question about a person with Cole's character and history, Dr. Dickerson acknowledged that he would be \"alarmed\" about the future conduct of such a person because \"yes, there absolutely is a probability that they would commit... future acts of violence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 113. In sum, the strength of Cole's mitigating evidence was not its potential to contest his immediate dangerousness, to which end the experts' testimony was at least as harmful as it was helpful. Instead, its strength was its tendency to prove that his violent propensities were caused by factors beyond his control\u0097 namely, neurological damage and childhood neglect and abandonment.</p>\n<p>It was these latter considerations, however, that the prosecutor discouraged jurors from taking into account when formulating their answers to the special issues. During the <i>voir dire,</i> the prosecutor advised the jurors that they had a duty to answer the special issues based on the facts, and the extent to which such facts objectively supported findings of deliberateness and future dangerousness, rather than their views about what might be an appropriate punishment for this particular defendant. For example, juror Beeson was asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[I]f a person had a bad upbringing, but looking at those special issues, you felt that they <i>[sic]</i> met the standards regarding deliberateness and being a continuing threat to society, could you still vote `yes,' even though you felt like maybe they'd <i>[sic]</i> had a rough time as a kid? If you felt that the facts brought to you by the prosecution warranted a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1662</span> `yes' answer, could you put that out of your mind and just go by the facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[T]hat would not keep you from answering `yes,' just because a person had a poor upbringing, would it?\" XI Voir Dire Statement of Facts filed in No. CR88-0043-A (Dist. Ct. Tom Green Cty., Tex., 51st Jud. Dist.), p. 1588.</blockquote>\n<p>The prosecutor began his final closing argument with a reminder to the jury that during the <i>voir dire</i> they had \"promised the State that, if it met its burden of proof,\" they would answer \"yes\" to both special issues. App. 145. The trial judge refused to give any of several instructions requested by Cole that would have authorized a negative answer to either of the special issues on the basis of \"any evidence which, in [the jury's] opinion, mitigate[d] against the imposition of the Death Penalty, including any aspect of the Defendant's character or record.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 115; see also <i>id.,</i> at 117-124. Ultimately, the jurors answered both issues in the affirmative and Cole was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p>On direct appeal, the sole issue raised by Cole was that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's verdict. The CCA rejected Cole's claim and affirmed the judgment of the trial court on September 26, 1990.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>On March 2, 1992, the lawyer who then represented Cole filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the Texas trial court, alleging 21 claims of error.<sup>[3]</sup> Counsel later withdrew, and after delays caused in part by a letter from Cole to the trial judge stating that he wished to withdraw his \"appeal,\" the judge ultimately \"had petitioner bench warranted\" to a hearing on September 4, 1998. <i>Id.,</i> at 152-153. During that hearing, Cole advised the court that he wished to proceed with his habeas proceedings and to have the CCA appoint counsel to represent him. Without counsel having been appointed to represent Cole, and without conducting an evidentiary hearing, the trial court entered its findings and conclusions recommending denial of the application.</p>\n<p>Three of Cole's 21 claims related to the jury's inability to consider mitigating evidence. The trial judge rejected the first\u0097 \"that his mitigating evidence was not able to be properly considered and given effect by the jury under the special issues,\" <i>id.,</i> at 157\u0097because he concluded that the record, and \"especially\" the testimony of the two expert witnesses, \"provide[d] a basis for the jury to sufficiently consider the mitigating evidence offered by petitioner,\"<sup>[4]</sup><i>id.,</i> at 161. With respect to Cole's second claim, the judge agreed that appellate counsel had been ineffective for failing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1663</span> to assign error based on \"the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on mitigating evidence as contemplated by the <i>Pendry [sic]</i> decision.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 166. He nevertheless found that the result on appeal would have been the same had the point been raised. <i>Ibid.</i> On the third claim relating to mitigating evidence, the judge rejected Cole's argument that the trial court's failure to specifically instruct the jury to consider mitigating evidence and offer a definition of \"mitigating\" was error. <i>Id.,</i> at 173.</p>\n<p>Over the dissent of two members of the court, and after adopting the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law with only minor changes, the CCA denied Cole's application for state collateral relief. <i>Ex parte Cole,</i> No. 41,673-01 (Nov. 24, 1999) <i>(per curiam),</i> App. 178-179. We consolidated this case with <i>Brewer v.

His principal claim then, as it is now, was that the sentencing jury \"was unable to consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence in his case,\" in violation of the Constitution. <i>Cole v. Johnson,</i> Civ. Action No. 6:00-CV-014-C (ND Tex., Mar. 6, 2001), p. 5, App. 184.</p>\n<p>In its opinion denying relief, the District Court began by summarizing Cole's mitigating evidence, highlighting his \"destructive family background.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The court then correctly described our decision in <i>Penry I,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112325\"><a href=\"/opinion/112325/penry-v-lynaugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256, in these words:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In <i>[Penry]</i> the Supreme Court found that when the defendant places mitigating evidence before the jury, Texas juries must be given instructions which allow the jury to give effect to that mitigating evidence and to express its reasoned moral response to that evidence in determining whether to impose the death penalty.\"<sup>[5]</sup> Civ. Action No. 6:00-CV-014-C, at 8-9, App. 188.</blockquote>\n<p>The court next noted that the Fifth Circuit had formulated its own analysis for evaluating <i>Penry</i> claims. Under that analysis, for mitigating evidence to be constitutionally relevant, it \"must show (1) a <i>uniquely severe permanent handicap</i> with which the defendant is burdened through no fault of his own, ... and (2) that the <i>criminal act was attributable to this severe permanent condition.</i>\" Civ. Action No. 6:00-CV-014-C, at 9, App. 189 (quoting <i>Davis v.

Ultimately, Cole's inability to show a \"nexus\" between his troubled family background and his commission of capital murder doomed his <i>Penry</i> claim. Civ. Action No. 6:00-CV-014-C, at 13, App. 193.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals denied Cole's application for a certificate of appealability (COA), holding that \"reasonable jurists would not debate the district court's conclusion that Cole's evidence was not constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence.\" <i>Cole v. Dretke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791373\"><a href=\"/opinion/791373/ted-calvin-cole-now-known-as-jalil-abdul-kabir-v-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span>, 498 (C.A.5 2005). Shortly thereafter, however, we held that the Fifth Circuit's \"screening <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1664</span> test\" for determining the \"`constitutional relevance'\" of mitigating evidence had \"no foundation in the decisions of this Court.\" <i>Tennard v. Dretke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136994\"><a href=\"/opinion/136994/tennard-v-dretke-director-texas-department-of-crim/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 284, 124 S.Ct. 2562, 159 L.Ed.2d 384 (2004). Accordingly, we vacated its order denying a COA in this case and remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the Court of Appeals reviewed Cole's <i>Penry</i> claim on the merits and affirmed the District Court's judgment denying the writ.</p>\n<p>Focusing primarily on the testimony of petitioner's two experts rather than that of his mother and his aunt, the Court of Appeals reviewed our recent decisions and concluded \"that the Texas special issues allowed the jury to give `full consideration and full effect' to the mitigating evidence that Cole presented at the punishment phase of his trial.\"<sup>[6]</sup> 418 F.3d, at 511. With two judges dissenting, the court denied the petition for rehearing en banc.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Because Cole filed his federal habeas petition after the effective date of AEDPA, the provisions of that Act govern the scope of our review. We must therefore ask whether the CCA's adjudication of Cole's claim on the merits \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). We conclude that it did.</p>\n<p>A careful review of our jurisprudence in this area makes clear that well before our decision in <i>Penry I,</i> our cases had firmly established that sentencing juries must be able to give meaningful consideration and effect to all mitigating evidence that might provide a basis for refusing to impose the death penalty on a particular individual, notwithstanding the severity of his crime or his potential to commit similar offenses in the future. Three of the five cases decided on the same day in 1976\u0097 <i>Woodson v. North Carolina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109535\"><a href=\"/opinion/109535/woodson-v-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976), <i>Proffitt v.

Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109534\"><a href=\"/opinion/109534/jurek-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976)\u0097identified the background principles we would apply in later cases to evaluate specific rules inhibiting the jury's ability to give meaningful effect to such mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p>In <i>Woodson v. North Carolina</i><i>,</i> we invalidated a statute that made death the mandatory sentence for all persons convicted of first-degree murder. One of the statute's constitutional shortcomings was its \"failure to allow the particularized consideration of relevant aspects of the character and record of each convicted defendant before the imposition upon him of a sentence of death.\" 428 U.S., at 303, 96 S.Ct. 2978 (plurality opinion).<sup>[8]</sup> In <i>Proffitt v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1665</span> <i>Florida</i> and <i>Jurek v. Texas</i><i>,</i> the joint opinions rejected facial challenges to the sentencing statutes enacted in Florida and Texas, assuming in both cases that provisions allowing for the unrestricted admissibility of mitigating evidence would ensure that a sentencing jury had adequate guidance in performing its sentencing function.<sup>[9]</sup> As a majority of the Court later acknowledged, our holding in <i>Jurek</i> did not preclude the possibility that the Texas sentencing statute might be found unconstitutional <i>as applied</i> in a particular case. See n. 15, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>Two years later, in <i>Lockett v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), a plurality concluded \"that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, not be precluded from considering, <i>as a mitigating factor,</i> any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954 (footnote omitted). Because Ohio's death penalty statute was inconsistent with this principle, it was declared unconstitutional. The plurality noted the possible tension between a holding that the Ohio statute was invalid and our decisions in <i>Proffitt</i> and <i>Jurek</i> upholding the Florida and Texas statutes, but distinguished those cases because neither statute \"clearly operated at that time to prevent the sentencer from considering any aspect of the defendant's character and record or any circumstances of his offense as an independently mitigating factor.\" 438 U.S., at 607, 98 S.Ct. 2954.</p>\n<p>While Chief Justice Burger's opinion in <i>Lockett</i> was joined by only three other Justices, the rule it announced was endorsed and broadened in our subsequent decisions in <i>Eddings v. Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110641\"><a href=\"/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), and <i>Skipper v.

In those cases, we emphasized the severity of imposing a death sentence and that \"the sentencer in capital cases must be permitted to consider <i>any</i> relevant mitigating factor.\"<sup>[10]</sup><i>Eddings,</i> 455 U.S., at 112, 102 S.Ct. 869 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>In the wake of our decision in <i>Lockett,</i> Ohio amended its capital sentencing statute to give effect to <i>Lockett's</i> holding.<sup>[11]</sup> Neither Florida nor Texas did so, however, until after our unanimous decision in <i>Hitchcock v. Dugger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111871\"><a href=\"/opinion/111871/hitchcock-v-dugger/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 107 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1666</span> S.Ct. 1821, 95 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987), unequivocally confirmed the settled quality of the <i>Lockett</i> rule. As Justice SCALIA's opinion for the Court explained, the defendant had introduced some rather atypical mitigating evidence that was not expressly authorized by the Florida statute:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In the sentencing phase of this case, petitioner's counsel introduced before the advisory jury evidence that as a child petitioner had the habit of inhaling gasoline fumes from automobile gas tanks; that he had once passed out after doing so; that thereafter his mind tended to wander; that petitioner had been one of seven children in a poor family that earned its living by picking cotton; that his father had died of cancer; and that petitioner had been a fond and affectionate uncle to the children of one of his brothers.\" 481 U.S., at 397, 107 S.Ct. 1821.</blockquote>\n<p>As the opinion further explained, the Florida courts had construed the state statute to preclude consideration of mitigating factors unmentioned in the statute. Accordingly, despite our earlier decision in <i>Proffitt</i> upholding the statute against a facial challenge, it was necessary to set aside Hitchcock's death sentence. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We think it could not be clearer that the advisory jury was instructed not to consider, and the sentencing judge refused to consider, evidence of nonstatutory mitigating circumstances, and that the proceedings therefore did not comport with the requirements of <i>Skipper v. South Carolina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111657\"><a href=\"/opinion/111657/skipper-v-south-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>[, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1] (1986), <i>Eddings v. Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110641\"><a href=\"/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>[, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1] (1982), and <i>Lockett v.

Respondent has made no attempt to argue that this error was harmless, or that it had no effect on the jury or the sentencing judge. In the absence of such a showing our cases hold that the exclusion of mitigating evidence of the sort at issue here renders the death sentence invalid. See <i>Skipper, supra</i> (evidence that defendant had adapted well to prison life); <i>Eddings, supra</i> (evidence of 16-year-old defendant's troubled family history and emotional disturbance).\" 481 U.S., at 398-399, 107 S.Ct. 1821.</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, our reference to \"exclusion\" of the evidence did not refer to its admissibility, but rather to its exclusion from meaningful consideration by the jury. Had <i>Jurek</i> and <i>Proffitt</i> truly stood for the proposition that the mere availability of relevant mitigating evidence was sufficient to satisfy the Constitution's requirements, <i>Hitchcock</i> could never have been decided as it was.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1667</span> In the year following our decision in <i>Hitchcock,</i> we made clear that sentencing under the Texas statute, like that under the Florida statute, must accord with the <i>Lockett</i> rule. In <i>Franklin v. Lynaugh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112122\"><a href=\"/opinion/112122/franklin-v-lynaugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 172, 177, 183, 108 S.Ct. 2320, 101 L.Ed.2d 155 (1988), the plurality rejected the claim that the judge's instructions did not allow the jury to give adequate weight to whatever \"`residual doubts'\" it may have had concerning the defendant's guilt, or to evidence of the petitioner's good behavior while in prison. That particular holding is unremarkable because we have never held that capital defendants have an Eighth Amendment right to present \"residual doubt\" evidence at sentencing, see <i>Oregon v. Guzek,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145676\"><a href=\"/opinion/145676/oregon-v-guzek/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 523-527, 126 S.Ct. 1226, 163 L.Ed.2d 1112 (2006), and in most cases evidence of good behavior in prison is primarily, if not exclusively, relevant to the issue of future dangerousness. What makes <i>Franklin</i> significant, however, is the separate opinion of Justice O'Connor, and particularly those portions of her opinion expressing the views of five Justices, see <i>infra,</i> at 1668-1669, and n. 15. After summarizing the cases that clarified <i>Jurek's</i> holding,<sup>[13]</sup> she wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In my view, the principle underlying <i>Lockett, Eddings,</i> and <i>Hitchcock</i> is that punishment should be directly related to the personal culpability of the criminal defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`[E]vidence about the defendant's background and character is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background, or to emotional and mental problems, may be less culpable than defendants who have no such excuse .... Thus, the sentence imposed at the penalty stage should reflect a reasoned <i>moral</i> response to the defendant's background, character, and crime.' <i>California v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111797\"><a href=\"/opinion/111797/california-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 545, 107 S.Ct. 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In light of this principle it is clear that a State may not constitutionally prevent the sentencing body from giving effect to evidence relevant to the defendant's background or character or the circumstances of the offense that mitigates against the death penalty. <i>Indeed, the right to have the sentencer consider and weigh relevant mitigating evidence would be meaningless unless the sentencer was also permitted to give effect to its consideration.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1668</span> \"Under the sentencing procedure followed in this case the jury could express its views about the appropriate punishment only by answering the special verdict questions regarding the deliberateness of the murder and the defendant's future dangerousness. To the extent that the mitigating evidence introduced by petitioner was relevant to one of the special verdict questions, the jury was free to give effect to that evidence by returning a negative answer to that question. If, however, petitioner had introduced mitigating evidence about his background or character or the circumstances of the crime that was not relevant to the special verdict questions, or that had relevance to the defendant's moral culpability beyond the scope of the special verdict questions, the jury instructions would have provided the jury with no vehicle for expressing its `reasoned moral response' to that evidence.\" 487 U.S., at 183, 184-185, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court in <i>Penry I</i> endorsed the views she had expressed in <i>Franklin</i> and unquestionably governs the facts of this case.<sup>[14]</sup> Penry contended that his mitigating evidence of mental retardation and an abusive childhood provided a basis for a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death and that the jury should have been instructed that it could consider that evidence when making its sentencing decision. In response to that contention, our opinion first held that Penry was not asking us to make new law because he was relying on a rule that was \"dictated\" by earlier cases, see n. 10, <i>supra,</i> and explained why Justice O'Connor's separate opinion in <i>Franklin</i> correctly defined the relevant rule of law.<sup>[15]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1669</span> In <i>Franklin,</i> we noted, \"both the concurrence and the dissent stressed that `the right to have the sentencer consider and weigh relevant mitigating evidence would be meaningless unless the sentencer was also permitted to give effect to its consideration' in imposing sentence.\" 492 U.S., at 321, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (citing <i>Franklin,</i> 487 U.S., at 185, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 199, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (STEVENS, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p>Applying that standard, we held that neither the \"deliberateness\" nor the \"future dangerousness\" special issue provided the jury with a meaningful opportunity to give effect to Penry's mitigating evidence. With respect to the former, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In the absence of jury instructions defining `deliberately' in a way that would clearly direct the jury to consider fully Penry's mitigating evidence as it bears on his personal culpability, we cannot be sure that the jury was able to give effect to the mitigating evidence of Penry's mental retardation and history of abuse in answering the first special issue. Without such a special instruction, a juror who believed that Penry's retardation and background diminished his moral culpability and made imposition of the death penalty unwarranted would be unable to give effect to that conclusion if the juror also believed that Penry committed the crime `deliberately.' Thus, we cannot be sure that the jury's answer to the first special issue reflected a `reasoned moral response' to Penry's mitigating evidence.\" 492 U.S., at 323, 109 S.Ct. 2934.</blockquote>\n<p>With respect to the future dangerousness issue, we emphasized the fact that Penry's evidence of mental retardation was relevant only as an aggravating factor. <i>Id.,</i> at 323-324, 109 S.Ct. 2934. More broadly, we noted that the evidence of Penry's mental retardation and childhood abuse functioned as a \"two-edged sword,\" because it \"may diminish his blameworthiness for his crime even as it indicates that there is a probability that he will be dangerous in the future.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 324, 109 S.Ct. 2934. We therefore held that, in the absence of an appropriate instruction directing the \"jury to consider fully\" mitigating evidence as it bears on the extent to which a defendant is undeserving of a death sentence, \"we cannot be sure\" that it did so. <i>Id.,</i> at 323, 109 S.Ct. 2934. As our discussion of the deliberateness issue demonstrates, we did not limit our holding in <i>Penry I</i> to mitigating evidence that can only be viewed as aggravating. When the evidence proffered is double edged, or is as likely to be viewed as aggravating as it is as mitigating, the statute most obviously fails to provide for adequate consideration of such evidence.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1670</span> The former special issues (as composed at the time of both Penry's and Cole's sentencing proceedings) provided an adequate vehicle for the evaluation of mitigating evidence offered to disprove deliberateness or future dangerousness. As Judge Reavley noted in his opinion for the Court of Appeals in <i>Penry I,</i> however, they did not tell the jury as to what \"to do if it decided that Penry, because of retardation, arrested emotional development and a troubled youth, should not be executed.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 324, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>In recommending denial of Cole's application for collateral relief, the Texas trial judge did not analyze <i>Penry I</i> itself. Under the framework set forth in <i>Penry I,</i><sup>[17]</sup> the testimony of Cole's mother and aunt, as well as the portions of the expert testimony suggesting that his dangerous character may have been the result of his rough childhood and possible neurological damage, were not relevant to either of the special verdict questions, except, possibly, as evidence supporting the State's argument that Cole would be dangerous in the future. This would not satisfy the requirement of <i>Penry I,</i> however, that the evidence be permitted its mitigating force beyond the scope of the special issues. Therefore, it would have followed that those questions failed to provide the jury with a vehicle for expressing its \"reasoned moral response\" to that evidence.</p>\n<p>Instead of relying on <i>Penry I,</i> the trial judge relied on three later Texas cases and on our opinion in <i>Graham v. Collins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112810\"><a href=\"/opinion/112810/graham-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 892, 122 L.Ed.2d 260 (1993), as having held that nine different categories of mitigating evidence\u0097including a troubled family background, bipolar disorder, low IQ, substance abuse, paranoid personality disorder, and child abuse\u0097were sufficiently considered under the Texas special issues.<sup>[18]</sup> App. 159-160. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1671</span> Applying those cases, the judge defined the legal issue \"whether the mitigating evidence can be sufficiently considered\" as one that \"must be determined on a case by case basis, depending on the nature of the mitigating evidence offered and whether there exists other testimony in the record that would allow consideration to be given.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 160. As we have noted, in endorsing this formulation of the issue, neither the trial judge nor the CCA had the benefit of any input from counsel representing petitioner. See Part II, <i>supra.</i> In our view, denying relief on the basis of that formulation of the issue, while ignoring the fundamental principles established by our most relevant precedents, resulted in a decision that was both \"contrary to\" and \"involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p>The state court's primary reliance on <i>Graham,</i> to the exclusion of our other cases in this line of jurisprudence, was misguided. In <i>Graham,</i> we held that granting collateral relief to a defendant who had been sentenced to death in 1984 would require the announcement of a new rule of constitutional law in contravention of <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). In reaching that conclusion we relied heavily on the fact that in 1984 it was reasonable for judges to rely on the interpretation of <i>Jurek</i> that the plurality had espoused in <i>Franklin.</i> See 506 U.S., at 468-472, 113 S.Ct. 892; see also n. 15, <i>supra.</i> But as we have explained, in both <i>Franklin</i> and <i>Penry I,</i> a majority of the Court ultimately rejected the plurality's interpretation of <i>Jurek.</i> Neither <i>Franklin</i> nor <i>Penry I</i> was inconsistent with <i>Graham's</i> narrow holding, but they do suggest that our later decisions\u0097including <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112897\"><a href=\"/opinion/112897/johnson-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993), in which we refused to adopt the rule that Graham sought<sup>[19]</sup>\u0097are of more relevance to Cole's case than <i>Graham.</i> The relevance of those cases lies not in their results\u0097in several instances, we concluded, after applying the relevant law, that the special issues provided for adequate consideration of the defendant's mitigating evidence<sup>[20]</sup>\u0097but in their failure to disturb the basic legal principle that continues to govern such cases: The jury must have a \"meaningful basis to consider the relevant mitigating qualities\" of the defendant's proffered evidence.<sup>[21]</sup><i>Johnson,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1672</span> 509 U.S., at 369, 113 S.Ct. 2658; see also <i>Graham,</i> 506 U.S., at 474, 113 S.Ct. 892 (explaining that Penry was entitled to additional instructions \"[b]ecause it was impossible [for the jury] to give meaningful mitigating effect to Penry's evidence by way of answering the special issues\").</p>\n<p>Before turning to those more recent cases, it is appropriate to identify the reasons why the CCA's ruling was not a reasonable application of <i>Penry I</i> itself. First, the ruling ignored the fact that even though Cole's mitigating evidence may not have been as persuasive as Penry's, it was relevant to the question of Cole's moral culpability for precisely the same reason as Penry's. Like Penry's evidence, Cole's evidence of childhood deprivation and lack of self-control did not rebut either deliberateness or future dangerousness but was intended to provide the jury with an entirely different reason for not imposing a death sentence. Second, the judge's assumption that it would be appropriate to look at \"other testimony in the record\" to determine whether the jury could give mitigating effect to the testimony of Cole's mother and aunt is neither reasonable nor supported by the <i>Penry</i> opinion. App. 160. Third, the fact that the jury could give mitigating effect to some of the experts' testimony, namely, their predictions that Cole could be expected to become less dangerous as he aged, provides no support for the conclusion that the jury understood it could give such effect to other portions of the experts' testimony or that of other witnesses. In sum, the judge ignored our entire line of cases establishing the importance of allowing juries to give meaningful effect to any mitigating evidence providing a basis for a sentence of life rather than death. His recommendation to the CCA was therefore unsupported by either the text or the reasoning in <i>Penry I.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p>The same principles originally set forth in earlier cases such as <i>Lockett</i> and <i>Eddings</i> have been articulated explicitly by our later cases, which explained that the jury must be permitted to \"consider fully\" such mitigating evidence and that such consideration \"would be meaningless\" unless the jury not only had such evidence available to it, but also was permitted to give that evidence meaningful, mitigating effect in imposing the ultimate sentence. <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S., at 321, 323, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Graham,</i> 506 U.S., at 475, 113 S.Ct. 892 (acknowledging that a \"constitutional defect\" has occurred not only when a jury is \"precluded from even considering certain types of mitigating evidence,\" but also when \"the defendant's evidence [i]s placed before the sentencer but the sentencer ha[s] no reliable means of giving mitigating effect to that evidence\").</p>\n<p>Four of our more recent cases lend support to the conclusion that the CCA's decision was unsupported by either the text or the reasoning of <i>Penry I.</i><sup>[22]</sup> In <i>Johnson v. Texas</i><i>,</i> we held that the Texas special issues allowed adequate consideration of petitioner's youth as a mitigating circumstance. Indeed, we thought it \"strain[ed] credulity to suppose that the jury would have viewed the evidence of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1673</span> petitioner's youth as outside its effective reach\" because its relevance was so obvious. 509 U.S., at 368, 113 S.Ct. 2658. There is of course a vast difference between youth\u0097a universally applicable mitigating circumstance that every juror has experienced and which necessarily is transient\u0097and the particularized childhood experiences of abuse and neglect that <i>Penry I</i> and <i>Cole</i> described\u0097which presumably most jurors have never experienced and which affect each individual in a distinct manner.</p>\n<p>Evidence of youth, moreover, has special relevance to the question of future dangerousness. A critical assumption motivating the Court's decision in <i>Johnson</i> was that juries would in fact be able to give mitigating effect to the evidence, albeit within the confines of the special issues. See 509 U.S., at 370, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (\"If any jurors believed that the transient qualities of petitioner's youth made him less culpable for the murder, there is no reasonable likelihood that those jurors would have deemed themselves foreclosed from considering that in evaluating petitioner's future dangerousness\"). Prosecutors in some subsequent cases, however, have undermined this assumption, taking pains to convince jurors that the law compels them to disregard the force of evidence offered in mitigation. Cole's prosecution is illustrative: the State made jurors \"promise\" they would look only at the questions posed by the special issues, which, according to the prosecutor, required a juror to \"put ... out of [his] mind\" Cole's mitigating evidence and \"just go by the facts.\" <i>Supra,</i> at 1662. Arguments like these are at odds with the Court's understanding in <i>Johnson</i> that juries could and would reach mitigating evidence proffered by a defendant. Nothing in <i>Johnson</i> forecloses relief in these circumstances. See 509 U.S., at 369, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (\"<i>Penry</i> remains the law and must be given a fair reading\").</p>\n<p>This conclusion derives further support from the fact that, in <i>Johnson,</i> the Court understood that the defendant's evidence of youth\u0097including testimony from his father that \"his son's actions were due in large part to his youth,\" <i>id.,</i> at 368, 113 S.Ct. 2658, and counsel's corresponding arguments that the defendant could change as he grew older\u0097was \"readily comprehended as a mitigating factor,\" <i>id.,</i> at 369, 113 S.Ct. 2658, in the context of the special issues. The evidence offered in this case, however, as well as that offered by the petitioner in <i>Brewer,</i> ___ U.S. at ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 1706, 1709-1710, and n.1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"45979\"><a href=\"/opinion/45979/brewer-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1201609</span></a></span>, is closer in nature to that offered by the defendant in <i>Penry I</i> than that at issue in <i>Johnson.</i> While the consideration of the defendant's mitigating evidence of youth in <i>Johnson</i> could easily have directed jurors towards a \"no\" answer with regard to the question of future dangerousness, a juror considering Cole's evidence of childhood neglect and abandonment and possible neurological damage or Brewer's evidence of mental illness, substance abuse, and a troubled childhood could feel compelled to provide a \"yes\" answer to the same question, finding himself without a means for giving <i>meaningful</i> effect to the mitigating qualities of such evidence.<sup>[23]</sup> In such a case, there is a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1674</span> reasonable likelihood that the special issues would preclude that juror from giving meaningful consideration to such mitigating evidence, as required by <i>Penry I.</i> See <i>Johnson,</i> 509 U.S., at 367, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (explaining that in <i>Boyde v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112386\"><a href=\"/opinion/112386/boyde-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990), \"we held that a reviewing court must determine `whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence'\").</p>\n<p>In three later cases, we gave <i>Penry I</i> the \"fair reading\" required by <i>Johnson</i> and repudiated several Fifth Circuit precedents providing the basis for its narrow reading of that case. First, in our review of Penry's resentencing, at which the judge had supplemented the special issues with a nullification instruction, we again concluded that the jury had not been provided with an adequate \"vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response\" to his mitigating evidence. <i>Penry v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118438\"><a href=\"/opinion/118438/penry-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span>, 797, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001) <i>(Penry II)</i><i>.</i> Indeed, given that the resentencing occurred after the enactment of AEDPA, we concluded (contrary to the views of the Fifth Circuit, which had denied Penry a COA) that the CCA's judgment affirming the death sentence was objectively unreasonable. <i>Id.,</i> at 803-804, 121 S.Ct. 1910. Second, and as we have already noted, in <i>Tennard</i> we held that the Fifth Circuit's test for identifying relevant mitigating evidence was incorrect. 542 U.S., at 284, 124 S.Ct. 2562. Most recently, in <i>Smith v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137727\"><a href=\"/opinion/137727/smith-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 400, 160 L.Ed.2d 303 (2004) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> and again contrary to the views of the Fifth Circuit, we held that a nullification instruction that was different from the one used in Penry's second sentencing hearing did not foreclose the defendant's claim that the special issues had precluded the jury from \"expressing a `reasoned moral response' to <i>all</i> of the evidence relevant to the defendant's culpability.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 46, 125 S.Ct. 400.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII</h2>\n<p>Our line of cases in this area has long recognized that before a jury can undertake the grave task of imposing a death sentence, it must be allowed to consider a defendant's moral culpability and decide whether death is an appropriate punishment for that individual in light of his personal history and characteristics and the circumstances of the offense.<sup>[24]</sup> As Chief Justice Burger wrote in <i>Lockett:</i></p>\n<blockquote>\"There is no perfect procedure for deciding in which cases governmental authority should be used to impose death. But a statute that prevents the sentencer in all capital cases from giving independent mitigating weight to aspects of the defendant's character and record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty. When the choice is between life and death, that risk is unacceptable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1675</span> and incompatible with the commands of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" 438 U.S., at 605, 98 S.Ct. 2954.</blockquote>\n<p>Our cases following <i>Lockett</i> have made clear that when the jury is not permitted to give meaningful effect or a \"reasoned moral response\" to a defendant's mitigating evidence\u0097because it is forbidden from doing so by statute or a judicial interpretation of a statute\u0097the sentencing process is fatally flawed.<sup>[25]</sup> For that reason, our post-<i>Penry</i> cases are fully consistent with our conclusion that the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case must be reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice SCALIA, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>A jury imposed a sentence of death in each of these cases, despite hearing mitigating evidence from the defendants about their troubled backgrounds. The convictions and sentences were upheld on direct review. On state collateral review, each defendant claimed that the jury instructions did not allow sufficient consideration of the mitigating evidence. This Court had considered similar challenges to the <i>same</i> instructions no fewer than five times in the years before the state habeas courts considered the challenges at issue here. See <i>Jurek v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109534\"><a href=\"/opinion/109534/jurek-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976); <i>Franklin v.

Four of the cases rejected the defendant's challenge. Only one\u0097<i>Penry I</i>\u0097upheld it. The guidance the Court gave in these five cases on whether the jury instructions at issue allowed sufficient consideration of mitigating evidence amounted to\u0097it depends. It depends on the particular characteristics of the evidence in a specific case. The state courts here rejected the claim as applied to the particular mitigating evidence in these cases, and the defendants sought federal habeas review.</p>\n<p>Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), however, a state-court decision can be set aside on federal habeas review only if it is \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1676</span> \u00a7 2254(d)(1). When this Court considers similar challenges to the same jury instructions five separate times, it usually is not because the applicable legal rules are \"clearly established.\" The Court today nonetheless picks from the five precedents the <i>one</i> that ruled in favor of the defendant\u0097 <i>Penry I</i>\u0097and anoints <i>that</i> case as the one embodying \"clearly established Federal law.\" In doing so the Court fails to give any meaningful weight to the two pertinent precedents <i>subsequent</i> to <i>Penry I\u0097Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i>\u0097even though those cases adopted a more \"limited view\" of <i>Penry I</i> than the Court embraces today. <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 365, 113 S.Ct. 2658. Indeed, the reading of <i>Penry I</i> in <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i> prompted every one of the remaining Justices who had been in the majority in <i>Penry I</i> on the pertinent question to dissent in <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson,</i> on the ground that the Court was failing to adhere to <i>Penry I.</i></p>\n<p>I suppose the Court today is free to ignore the import of <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i> on the question of what <i>Penry I</i> means, but in 1999 or 2001, respectively\u0097when petitioners were denied collateral relief\u0097 the state courts did not have that luxury. They should not be faulted today for concluding\u0097exactly as the <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i> dissenters did\u0097that the Court had cut back significantly on <i>Penry I.</i></p>\n<p>We give ourselves far too much credit in claiming that our sharply divided, ebbing and flowing decisions in this area gave rise to \"clearly established\" federal law. If the law were indeed clearly established by our decisions \"as of the time of the relevant state-court decision,\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), it should not take the Court more than a dozen pages of close analysis of plurality, concurring, and even dissenting opinions to explain what that \"clearly established\" law was. <i>Ante,</i> at 1664-1672. When the state courts considered these cases, our precedents did not provide them with \"clearly established\" law, but instead a dog's breakfast of divided, conflicting, and ever-changing analyses. That is how the Justices on <i>this</i> Court viewed the matter, as they shifted from being in the majority, plurality, concurrence, or dissent from case to case, repeatedly lamenting the failure of their colleagues to follow a consistent path. Whatever the law may be today, the Court's ruling that `twas always so\u0097and that state courts were \"objectively unreasonable\" not to know it, <i>Williams, supra,</i> at 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495\u0097is utterly revisionist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1987, Jalil Abdul-Kabir\u0097referred to by his given name, Ted Calvin Cole, throughout this opinion, <i>ante,</i> at 1659, n. 1\u0097was convicted of capital murder after he confessed to strangling 66-year-old Raymond Richardson with a dog leash to steal $20 from him. Among the 21 claims Cole raised on state collateral review was a challenge under <i>Penry I,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112325\"><a href=\"/opinion/112325/penry-v-lynaugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256, to the application of Texas's special issue jury instructions. In evaluating Cole's challenge, the state habeas trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The issue is whether the sentencing jury had been unable to give effect to [Cole's] mitigating evidence within the confines of the statutory `special issues.'

The only thing clear about our jurisprudence on the pertinent question in 1999, however, is that it was unsettled and confused.</p>\n<p>In <i>Jurek,</i> the Court upheld Texas's use of the special issues as facially constitutional, with the controlling opinion noting that \"the constitutionality of the Texas procedures turns on whether the enumerated questions allow consideration of particularized mitigating factors.\" 428 U.S., at 272, 96 S.Ct. 2950 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.). In so doing, <i>Jurek</i> left open the possibility that some mitigating evidence might not be within the reach of the jury under the special issues; other types of mitigating evidence, of course, would be. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 272-273, 96 S.Ct. 2950 (suggesting that the future dangerousness special issue allowed the jury to consider prior criminal conduct, age, duress, and whether the defendant was under extreme mental pressure).</p>\n<p>The next occasion the Court had to consider mitigating evidence under the Texas special issues arose in <i>Franklin,</i> in which the Court concluded that the defendant's mitigating evidence of good behavior in prison was taken into account under the future dangerousness special issue. 487 U.S., at 178-179, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 186-187, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). A plurality of the Court also rejected the argument that a jury must be permitted to give \"independent\" effect to mitigating evidence\u0097beyond the special issues\u0097concluding that \"this submission is foreclosed by <i>Jurek</i>\" and rejecting the dissent's argument to the contrary. <i>Id.,</i> at 179-180, and n. 10, 108 S.Ct. 2320; see also <i>id.,</i> at 199-200, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The Court today places great weight on the opinion by Justice O'Connor concurring in the judgment in <i>Franklin,</i> an opinion joined only by Justice Blackmun. <i>Ante,</i> at 1667-1669. That separate opinion expressed \"doubts\" about the plurality's view that mitigating evidence need not be given effect beyond the special issues, noting that <i>if</i> the petitioner in <i>Franklin</i> had introduced evidence not covered by the special issues, \"we would have to decide whether the jury's inability to give effect to that evidence amounted to an Eighth Amendment violation.\" 487 U.S., at 183, 185, 108 S.Ct. 2320. The separate opinion concluded, however, that \"this is not such a case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 185, 108 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1678</span> 2320. According to the Court today, a discerning state judge should have seen that federal law was \"clearly established\" on the point by the concurring and dissenting opinions, not the plurality. <i>Ante,</i> at 1667-1669.</p>\n<p><i>Penry I,</i> decided the following Term, concluded that <i>in that case</i> the Texas instructions did not allow the jury to give mitigating effect to evidence of Penry's mental retardation and abusive childhood. 492 U.S., at 328, 315, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (\"Penry does not ... dispute that some types of mitigating evidence can be fully considered by the sentencer in the absence of special jury instructions. Instead, Penry argues that, <i>on the facts of this case,</i> the jury was unable to fully consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence ... in answering the three special issues\" (emphasis added; citations omitted)). In granting relief, the Court, quoting the <i>Franklin</i> concurrence, noted that Penry's evidence \"`had relevance to [his] moral culpability beyond the scope of the special verdict questions,'\" 492 U.S., at 322, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (quoting 487 U.S., at 185, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); some alterations deleted), and that it was relevant to the special issues \"only as an <i>aggravating</i> factor.\" 492 U.S., at 323, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (emphasis in original). According to the Court today, the views of the <i>Franklin</i> concurrence and dissent were thus elevated to the opinion of the Court in <i>Penry I,</i> again clearly establishing federal law. <i>Ante,</i> at 1668-1669, and n. 15. The four dissenters in <i>Penry I</i> complained that the Court's holding \"flatly contradic[ted]\" <i>Jurek,</i> and that in finding a constitutional violation, the Court was \"throwing away <i>Jurek</i> in the process.\" 492 U.S., at 355, 354, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>A state court looking at our pertinent precedents on the Texas special issue instructions would next have to consider the significance of <i>Saffle v. Parks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112390\"><a href=\"/opinion/112390/saffle-v-parks/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. 1257, 108 L.Ed.2d 415 (1990). That case\u0097issued less than nine months after <i>Penry I</i>\u0097considered Oklahoma instructions, but extensively analyzed <i>Penry I</i> in doing so. See 494 U.S., at 491-492, 110 S.Ct. 1257. The Court concluded that the mitigating evidence in that case could be adequately considered by the jury under the instructions given. The four dissenters in <i>Saffle</i>\u0097including the author of today's opinion\u0097complained that the majority's discussion of <i>Penry I</i> was \"strangely reminiscent\" of the position of the <i>Penry I</i> dissenters. 494 U.S., at 504, 110 S.Ct. 1257 (opinion of Brennan, J.). The <i>Saffle</i> dissenters asserted that the majority's failure to reject the position of the <i>Penry I</i> dissenters \"creates considerable ambiguity about which <i>Lockett</i> [<i>v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978)] claims a federal court may hereafter consider on habeas corpus review.\" 494 U.S., at 504-505, 110 S.Ct. 1257.</p>\n<p>In <i>Graham,</i> decided three years later, the Court sought to clarify the interplay between <i>Jurek, Franklin,</i> and <i>Penry I</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It seems to us, however, that reading <i>Penry</i> as petitioner urges\u0097and thereby holding that a defendant is entitled to special instructions whenever he can offer mitigating evidence that has <i>some</i> arguable relevance beyond the special issues\u0097would be to require in all cases that a fourth `special issue' be put to the jury: \"`Does any mitigating evidence before you, whether or not relevant to the above [three] questions, lead you to believe that the death penalty should not be imposed?'\" The <i>Franklin</i> plurality rejected precisely this contention, finding it irreconcilable with the Court's holding in <i>Jurek,</i> and <i>we affirm that conclusion today.</i>\" 506 U.S., at 476-477, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1679</span> 113 S.Ct. 892 (citation omitted; second emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, in <i>Graham</i> the Court rejected the reading of <i>Franklin</i> and <i>Penry I</i> that the Court today endorses, reasoning that it would require a new sentencing in every case, and would be impossible to square with <i>Jurek.</i><sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Although the Court today tells us it was clear that the applicable federal law was established by the <i>Franklin</i> concurrence and dissent, and that <i>Penry I</i> had to be read in that light, <i>ante,</i> at 1668-1669, the Court majority in <i>Graham</i> specifically relied instead upon the <i>Franklin</i> plurality in rejecting the same broad reading of <i>Penry I</i> the Court resuscitates today, <i>nunc pro tunc. </i><i>Graham, supra,</i> at 476-477, 113 S.Ct. 892. The dissenters in <i>Graham</i>\u0097 including every remaining Member of the <i>Penry I</i> majority\u0097were adamant that <i>Penry I</i> should have been controlling in <i>Graham.</i> See, <i>e.g.,</i> 506 U.S., at 507, 113 S.Ct. 892 (opinion of SOUTER, J., joined by Blackmun, STEVENS, and O'Connor, JJ.) (\"Our description of Penry's claim applies... almost precisely to Graham's claim\"); <i>id.,</i> at 508, 113 S.Ct. 892 (\"[Graham's] position is identical to that of Penry\"); <i>id.,</i> at 512, 113 S.Ct. 892 (\"<i>Penry</i> controls in this respect, and we should adhere to it\"); <i>id.,</i> at 520, 113 S.Ct. 892 (\"[T]he case is controlled by <i>Penry</i>\"). The issue is not whether the majority or the dissenters in <i>Graham</i> were right about how to read <i>Penry I,</i> but whether it was reasonable for a state court in 1999 to read it the way the majority in <i>Graham</i> plainly did.</p>\n<p>Later the same Term, in <i>Johnson,</i> the Court reaffirmed the \"limited view of <i>Penry</i>\" it had adopted in <i>Graham.</i> 509 U.S., at 365, 113 S.Ct. 2658. Once again the Court majority specifically relied on the <i>Franklin</i> plurality\u0097not the concurrence and dissent. See 509 U.S., at 370-371, 113 S.Ct. 2658. And once again the dissenters\u0097including every remaining Member of the <i>Penry I</i> majority\u0097lamented the Court's asserted failure to adhere to <i>Penry I.</i> 509 U.S., at 385-386, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Blackmun, STEVENS, and SOUTER, JJ.). The dissent\u0097by the <i>Penry I</i> author\u0097 made precisely the same point made by the Court today about how to read the <i>Franklin</i> concurrence and dissent. 509 U.S., at 385-386, 113 S.Ct. 2658. The difference, of course, was that in <i>Johnson</i> the point was made in dissent. It cannot have been \"objectively unreasonable\" for a state court, in 1999, to have been guided by the <i>Johnson</i> majority on this question, rather than by the dissent.</p>\n<p>In short, a state court reading our opinions would see an ongoing debate over the meaning and significance of <i>Penry I.</i> That state court would see four dissenters in <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i>\u0097including every remaining Member of the <i>Penry I</i> majority\u0097arguing that the Court was failing to follow or sharply limiting <i>Penry I</i> in those cases. On the flip side, the state court would see four dissenters in <i>Penry I</i>\u0097 every one later joining the majorities in <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i>\u0097suggesting that the <i>Penry I</i> majority departed from <i>Jurek.</i> It is in that context that the Court today <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1680</span> tells us that the state courts should have regarded <i>Penry I</i> as \"clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p>The Court asserts that <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson</i> did not \"disturb the basic legal principle\" at issue, <i>ante,</i> at 1671, and that we cite no post-<i>Penry I</i> cases inconsistent with its reading of that case, <i>ante,</i> at 1668, n. 14. I do not understand how the author of today's opinion can say that <i>Graham</i> did not disturb the principle of <i>Penry I,</i> however, when he joined a dissent in <i>Graham</i> stating that \"[Graham's] position is <i>identical</i> to that of Penry\" and that Graham's case \"is controlled by <i>Penry.</i>\" 506 U.S., at 508, 520, 113 S.Ct. 892 (opinion of SOUTER, J.) (emphasis added). That would seem to suggest that <i>Graham</i> was inconsistent with <i>Penry I.</i> I do not understand how the author of today's opinion can say that <i>Johnson</i> had no effect on <i>Penry I,</i> when he joined a dissent in <i>Johnson</i> stating that the majority opinion \"upset our settled Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.\" 509 U.S., at 382, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). Now <i>Johnson</i> is dismissed as just an application of \"basic legal principle[s],\" over which Justices can disagree, <i>ante,</i> at 1671; back then it \"upset our settled Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.\" And what of <i>Saffle</i>? There the author of today's opinion joined a dissent claiming that the majority was adopting the rule rejected in <i>Penry I.</i> 494 U.S., at 504, 110 S.Ct. 1257 (opinion of Brennan, J.). Again, that would seem to suggest inconsistency with <i>Penry I.</i><sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In fact, <i>Penry I</i> is not even consistent with the reading the Court ascribes to it\u0097 in that case the Court concluded that a jury could only view Penry's mitigating evidence as aggravating, and thus could not give the evidence <i>any</i> mitigating effect. 492 U.S., at 323, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (Penry's evidence was \"relevant only as an <i>aggravating</i> factor\" (emphasis in original)); see also <i>Graham, supra,</i> at 473, 113 S.Ct. 892 (\"Although Penry's evidence of mental impairment and childhood abuse indeed had relevance to the `future dangerousness' inquiry, its relevance was <i>aggravating</i> only\" (emphasis in original)). The Court concedes that Cole's evidence in the present case was not purely aggravating, see <i>ante,</i> at 1672 (\"[T]he jury could give mitigating effect to some of the experts' testimony\"), thus drawing into even starker contrast the rule that was established by a fair reading of <i>Penry I</i> in 1999 versus the rule the Court today reads <i>Penry I</i> to have \"clearly established.\"</p>\n<p>As might be expected in light of the foregoing, judges called upon to apply these precedents were confused by the ambiguity of this Court's pronouncements.

The court concluded that Cole's mitigating evidence \u0097 a troubled childhood and \"impulse control\" disorder \u0097 was more like that considered in <i>Johnson</i> and <i>Graham</i> than in <i>Penry I.</i> And because Cole's mitigating evidence was not as troubling as that at issue in <i>Penry I,</i> the state court did not act unreasonably in concluding that the collateral damage of his upbringing and impulse control disorder would, like youth in <i>Johnson,</i> dissipate over time, so that Cole would be less of a danger in the future. It is irrelevant that the ill effects of Cole's upbringing and impulse control disorder might not wear off for some time \u0097 there was no suggestion in <i>Johnson</i> that the petitioner in that case would become less dangerous any time soon.</p>\n<p>In other words, our precedents \u0097 which confirmed that the permanence of a mitigating feature was highly relevant, and that the correct answer was a case-specific matter turning on the particular facts \u0097 did not provide a clear answer, because the particular evidence before the court fell somewhere between the guideposts established by those precedents.

We see no reason to regard the circumstances of Graham's family background and positive character traits in a different light. Graham's evidence of transient upbringing and otherwise nonviolent character more closely resembles Jurek's evidence of age, employment history, and familial ties than it does Penry's evidence of mental retardation and harsh physical abuse.\" 506 U.S., at 476, 113 S.Ct. 892.</blockquote>\n<p>The state court thought that Cole's evidence \"more closely resemble[d]\" <i>Johnson</i> and <i>Graham</i> than <i>Penry I.</i> That cannot be said to be \"contrary to, or ... an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\" \u00a7 2254(d)(1). See <i>Brown, supra,</i> at 143, 147, 107 S.Ct. 837; <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S., at 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p>The Court further holds that the jury instructions did not permit Cole's evidence to have \"mitigating force beyond the scope of the special issues,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1670, as it now reads <i>Penry I</i> to require. At the time the state court ruled, however, <i>Graham</i> and <i>Johnson,</i> decided after <i>Penry I,</i> had expressly rejected the notion that a jury must \"be able to give effect to mitigating evidence in every conceivable manner in which the evidence might be relevant,\" so long as the jury could consider \"in some manner all of a defendant's relevant mitigating evidence.\" <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 372-373, 113 S.Ct. 2658. The state court found that Cole's mitigating evidence could be \"sufficiently consider[ed]\" by the jury \"within the confines of the statutory `special issues,'\" App. in No. 05-11284, at 161, 159, a holding consistent with this Court's precedents as of 1999 \u0097 and certainly not contrary to clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p>In reaching today's result, the Court also takes advantage of eight years of hindsight and relies on three cases that postdate the state court's ruling. <i>Ante,</i> at 1674 (citing <i>Penry v.

What is pertinent under AEDPA, however, is whether federal law was clearly established by our decisions when the state court acted. <i>Williams, supra,</i> at 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495.<sup>[3]</sup> AEDPA requires state courts to reasonably apply clearly established federal law. It does not require them to have a crystal ball.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In 1991, petitioner Brent Ray Brewer was convicted of murder committed during the course of a robbery. Like Cole, Brewer claims that the Texas special issues prevented the jury from giving effect to mitigating evidence that he suffered from depression and had been abused as a teenager. The Texas courts rejected these claims on both direct and collateral review.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1683</span> In evaluating Brewer's claim, the Court focuses on the so-called \"two-edged sword\" nature of the evidence found to be beyond the jury's reach in <i>Penry I,</i> and concludes that Brewer's mitigating evidence is similarly double edged. The state court distinguished <i>Penry I,</i> however, stating that \"a stay in a mental hospital does not evidence a long term mental illness which would affect appellant's ability to conform to the requirements of society,\" App. in No. 05-11287, p. 141 (internal quotation marks omitted), in contrast to Penry's \"organic brain disorder ... which made it impossible for him to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law,\" <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S., at 309, 109 S.Ct. 2934. The state court determined that the nature of Brewer's evidence allowed the jury to find that he would not be a future danger, whereas Penry's did not.</p>\n<p>The Court rejects this distinction, noting that while Brewer's mitigating evidence may have been less compelling than Penry's, \"that difference does not provide an acceptable justification for refusing to apply the reasoning in <i>Penry I</i> to this case.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1661-1663, and n. 5. This misses the point. The state court's distinction goes not to the relative strength of the mitigating evidence, but rather its character \u0097 an episodic rather than permanent mental disorder. As discussed in the context of Cole, see <i>supra,</i> at 1665, the distinction was not a \"refus[al] to apply the reasoning in <i>Penry I,</i>\" <i>ante,</i> at 1661-1662, but rather an application of <i>Penry I</i> that can hardly be said to be \"objectively unreasonable\" based on this Court's decisions as of 2001. Indeed, in considering future dangerousness, it is difficult to imagine a more pertinent distinction than whether a mental condition is or is not permanent.</p>\n<p>The Court concedes that \"[t]he transient quality of [Brewer's] mitigating evidence may make it more likely to fall in part within the ambit of the special issues,\" and yet still finds the state court's decision unreasonable because the evidence may have had relevance beyond the special issues. <i>Ante,</i> at 1662. As in Cole's case, this conclusion squarely conflicts with the Court's rejection in <i>Graham</i> of the proposition that \"a defendant is entitled to special instructions whenever he can offer mitigating evidence that has <i>some</i> arguable relevance beyond the special issues.\" 506 U.S., at 476, 113 S.Ct. 892 (emphasis in original). That rejection was confirmed in <i>Johnson,</i> see 509 U.S., at 372-373, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (rejecting a rule that \"would require that a jury be able to give effect to mitigating evidence in every conceivable manner in which the evidence might be relevant\" in favor of the rule \"that a jury be able to consider in some manner all of a defendant's relevant mitigating evidence\"). Once again, the Court rejects the state court's reasonable reading of existing cases in favor of its own revisionist reading of this Court's doctrine, heavily informed by subsequent decisions that the state court had no means to predict.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In AEDPA, Congress \"work[ed] substantial changes\" to the power of federal courts to grant habeas corpus relief. <i>Felker v. Turpin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118058\"><a href=\"/opinion/118058/felker-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 654, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996). In today's decisions, the Court trivializes AEDPA's requirements and overturns decades-old sentences on the ground that they were contrary to clearly established federal law at the time \u0097 even though the same Justices who form the majority today were complaining at that time that <i>this</i> Court was changing that \"clearly established\" law.</p>\n<p>Still, perhaps there is no reason to be unduly glum. After all, today the author of a dissent issued in 1988 writes two <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1684</span> majority opinions concluding that the views expressed in that dissent actually represented \"clearly established\" federal law at that time. So there is hope yet for the views expressed in <i>this</i> dissent, not simply down the road, but <i>tunc pro nunc.</i> Encouraged by the majority's determination that the future can change the past, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, and with whom Justice ALITO joins as to Part I, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I remain of the view \"that limiting a jury's discretion to consider all mitigating evidence does not violate the Eighth Amendment.\" <i>Ayers v. Belmontes,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 469, 480, 166 L.Ed.2d 334 (2006) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (citing <i>Walton v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112485\"><a href=\"/opinion/112485/walton-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span>, 673, 110 S.Ct. 3047, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>But even under this Court's precedents to the contrary, the state-court decisions in these two cases were hardly objectively unreasonable under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissenting opinion demonstrates. That is all which is needful to demonstrate the error of today's judgments. The full truth is worse than that, however. There was in fact clearly established law that governed these cases, and it favored the State. When the state courts rendered their decisions, <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112897\"><a href=\"/opinion/112897/johnson-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993), was this Court's most recent pronouncement on the Texas special issues. And in that case, the Court unambiguously drew back from the broader implications of its prior decision in <i>Penry v.

Reiterating what it had recently said in <i>Graham v. Collins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112810\"><a href=\"/opinion/112810/graham-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 475, 113 S.Ct. 892, 122 L.Ed.2d 260 (1993), the Court made clear that \"`[i]n <i>Penry,</i> the defendant's evidence was placed before the sentencer but the sentencer had <i>no reliable means</i> of giving mitigating effect to that evidence.'\" <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 366, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (emphasis added). <i>Penry I,</i> said <i>Johnson,</i> stood for the proposition that habeas relief was appropriate where jurors had been unable to give <i>any</i> mitigating effect to the evidence at issue. 509 U.S., at 369, 113 S.Ct. 2658; see also <i>Graham, supra,</i> at 475, 113 S.Ct. 892. <i>Penry I</i> in no way meant to imply, <i>Johnson</i> warned, \"that a jury [must] be able to give effect to mitigating evidence in <i>every conceivable manner</i> in which the evidence might be relevant.\" 509 U.S., at 372, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (emphasis added). <i>Johnson</i> thus established, in no uncertain terms, that jurors need only \"be able to consider <i>in some manner</i> all of a defendant's relevant mitigating evidence.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added); see generally <i>id.,</i> at 372-373, 113 S.Ct. 2658.</p>\n<p>The dissenters in <i>Johnson</i> very much disagreed with that analysis. They read <i>Penry I</i> for the more expansive proposition that \"the Texas special issues violated the Eighth Amendment to the extent they prevented the jury from giving <i>full</i> consideration and effect to a defendant's relevant mitigating evidence.\" 509 U.S., at 385, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (citing <i>Penry I, supra</i><i>;</i> emphasis added and deleted). \"[H]aving <i>some</i> relevance to [a special] issue,\" the dissent said, \"was not sufficient.\" 509 U.S., at 385, 113 S.Ct. 2658. And because youth (the mitigating feature in <i>Johnson</i>) had obvious relevance <i>beyond</i> the special issues, an additional instruction was needed. <i>Id.,</i> at 375, 113 S.Ct. 2658. The differences between the <i>Johnson</i> majority and dissenters could not have been more pronounced.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1685</span> Today the Court overrules <i>Johnson sub silentio,</i> and reinstates the \"full effect\" interpretation of <i>Penry I.</i> For as THE CHIEF JUSTICE explains, <i>ante,</i> at 1681, 1683 (dissenting opinion), it was not objectively unreasonable for the state courts to conclude that the ill effects of petitioners' mental illnesses and difficult childhoods would wear off in due time, allowing the jury to give that mitigating evidence <i>some effect</i> through the future dangerousness instruction \u0097 just as could be done for the mitigating factor of youth in <i>Johnson.</i> The Court nonetheless reverses these sentences because the juries were unable to give effect to \"any independent concern\" (independent, that is, of the Texas special issues) that the defendants \"may not be deserving of a death sentence,\" <i>Brewer,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct. <i>ante</i> at 1712, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"45979\"><a href=\"/opinion/45979/brewer-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1201609</span></a></span>, or to consider the evidence's \"relevance to the defendant's moral culpability beyond the scope of the special verdict questions,\" <i>id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. at 1713, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">477142</span></span> (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court does not acknowledge that it is overruling <i>Johnson,</i> but makes the Court of Appeals the scapegoat for its change of heart.</p>\n<p>The Fifth Circuit in both of these cases relied heavily on <i>Johnson</i> when denying relief. See <i>Cole v. Dretke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791373\"><a href=\"/opinion/791373/ted-calvin-cole-now-known-as-jalil-abdul-kabir-v-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span>, 505 (2005); <i>Brewer v. Dretke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"40767\"><a href=\"/opinion/40767/tennard-v-dretke/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 278, 281 (2006) (relying on <i>Cole</i>). How does the Court manage to distinguish it? The Court tries two main lines of argument. First, the Court explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A critical assumption motivating the Court's decision in <i>Johnson</i> was that juries would in fact be able to give mitigating effect to the evidence, albeit within the confines of the special issues .... Prosecutors in some subsequent cases, however, have undermined this assumption, taking pains to convince jurors that the law compels them to disregard the force of evidence offered in mitigation.\" <i>Abdul-Kabir, ante,</i> at 1673.</blockquote>\n<p>Because <i>Johnson's</i> \"critical assumption\" has now been \"undermined,\" the Court says, <i>Johnson</i> cannot be said to \"foreclos[e] relief in these circumstances.\" <i>Abdul-Kabir, ante,</i> at 1673.</p>\n<p>This attempt to \"distinguish\" <i>Johnson</i> wilts under even the mildest scrutiny. Since when does this Court craft constitutional rules that depend on the beneficence of the prosecutor? (Never mind that this \"critical assumption\" of <i>Johnson</i> was not so critical as to be mentioned in the case.) And more importantly, how can prosecutorial style have <i>any</i> bearing on whether the Eighth Amendment requires a jury to be able to give \"some effect,\" as opposed to \"full effect,\" to a defendant's mitigating evidence? It is of course true that a prosecutor's arguments may be relevant evidence in the final analysis of <i>whether</i> a capital trial has met the \"some effect\" test. But it has absolutely no relevance to <i>which test</i> is selected in the first place.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, the Court explains that \"the consideration of the defendant's mitigating evidence of youth in <i>Johnson</i> could easily have directed jurors towards a `no' answer with regard to the question of future dangerousness,\" whereas a juror considering petitioners' mitigating evidence \"could feel compelled to provide a `yes' answer to the same question.\" <i>Abdul-Kabir, ante,</i> at 1673. But it is quite apparent that jurors <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1686</span> considering youth in <i>Johnson</i> could also have \"fe[lt] compelled to provide a `yes' answer\" to the future dangerousness question. While one can believe that \"the impetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside,\" <i>Johnson,</i> 509 U.S., at 368, 113 S.Ct. 2658, one can also believe that a person who kills even in his younger years is fundamentally depraved, and more prone to a life of violent crime. <i>Johnson</i> itself explicitly recognized this point, denying relief despite \"the fact that a juror might view the evidence of youth as aggravating, as opposed to mitigating.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>As the Court's opinion effectively admits, nothing of a legal nature has changed since <i>Johnson.</i> What <i>has</i> changed are the moral sensibilities of the majority of the Court. For those in Texas who have already received the ultimate punishment, this judicial moral awakening comes too late. <i>Johnson</i> was the law, until today. And in the almost 15 years in-between, the Court today tells us, state and lower federal courts in countless appeals, and this Court in numerous denials of petitions for writ of certiorari, have erroneously relied on <i>Johnson</i> to allow the condemned to be taken to the death chamber. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Robison v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"15638\"><a href=\"/opinion/15638/robison-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span>, 269 (C.A.5 1998) (denying petition for rehearing), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></span>, 119 S.Ct. 1578, 143 L.Ed.2d 673 (1999) (petitioner executed Jan. 21, 2000); <i>Motley v.

That is because in my view the meaning of the Eighth Amendment is to be determined not by the moral perceptions of the Justices <i>du jour,</i> but by the understanding of the American people who adopted it \u0097 which understanding did not remotely include any requirement that a capital jury be permitted to consider all mitigating factors. If, however, a majority of the Justices are going to govern us by their moral perceptions, in this area at least they ought to get their moral perceptions right the first time. Whether one regards improvised death-is-different jurisprudence with disdain or with approval, no one can be at ease with the stark reality that this Court's vacillating pronouncements have produced grossly inequitable treatment of those on death row. Relief from sentence of death because of the jury's inability to give \"full effect\" to all mitigating factors has been made available only to those who have managed to drag out their habeas proceedings until today. This is not justice. It is caprice.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For purposes of consistency with testimony given by witnesses at trial and sentencing, we refer to petitioner throughout the opinion by his given name, Ted Cole.</p>\n<p>[2]  These were the two standard Texas special issues in place at the time of Cole's sentencing. In 1991, the Texas Legislature amended the special issues in response to this Court's decision in <i>Penry v. Lynaugh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112325\"><a href=\"/opinion/112325/penry-v-lynaugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989) <i>(Penry I)</i><i>,</i> to include language instructing the jury to decide \"[w]hether, taking into consideration all of the evidence, including the circumstances of the offense, the defendant's character and background, and the personal moral culpability of the defendant, there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole rather than a death sentence be imposed.\" Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071, \u00a7 2(e)(1) (Vernon 2006).</p>\n<p>[3]  Although Cole had not raised any of the 21 claims presented in his state habeas application on direct appeal\u0097including his claim that the jury heard significant mitigating evidence which it could neither consider nor give effect to under the Texas sentencing statute, in violation of <i>Penry I</i>\u0097under state law, his <i>Penry</i> claim remained cognizable on state habeas review. See <i>Ex parte Kunkle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1515279\"><a href=\"/opinion/1515279/ex-parte-kunkle/\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 502, n. 3 (Tex.Crim.App.1993) (en banc) (holding that \"we have held that [allegations of <i>Penry</i> error occurring in cases tried before <i>Penry</i>] are cognizable via habeas corpus despite an applicant's failure to raise them on direct appeal\"). Nor did Cole's failure to raise this claim on direct appeal affect its later review under AEDPA by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. See <i>Jackson v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"15327\"><a href=\"/opinion/15327/jackson-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 523 (C.A.5 1998) (holding that Texas' postconviction procedures provide petitioners \"adjudication on the merits\" sufficient to satisfy 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)).</p>\n<p>[4]  The trial judge also noted that there were \"no controverted, previously unresolved factual issues regarding petitioner's <i>Pendry</i> [sic] claim.\" App. 161.</p>\n<p>[5]  The contrast between the District Court's succinct statement of <i>Penry I's</i> holding and the prosecutor's explanation at <i>voir dire</i> of the jurors' duty to answer the special issues on the basis of the facts presented and not their views about Cole's moral culpability, see Part I, <i>supra,</i> could not be more stark.</p>\n<p>[6]  The Court of Appeals distinguished <i>Penry I</i> on the ground that Penry's evidence of mental retardation could only have been considered as aggravating, whereas this \"record does not suggest that the jury viewed Cole's mitigating evidence as an aggravating factor only.... [T]his evidence fits well within the broad scope of the future dangerousness special issue....\" 418 F.3d, at 506-507, and n. 54.</p>\n<p>[7]  In his dissent, Judge Dennis argued that the panel had improperly \"used another Fifth Circuit gloss upon a Supreme Court decision, i.e., the double edged evidence limitation of <i>Penry I,</i> that has no basis in the Supreme Court decisions, to avoid confronting the real issue.\" <i>Cole v. Dretke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793886\"><a href=\"/opinion/793886/ted-calvin-cole-now-known-as-jalil-abdul-kabir-v-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span>, 442 (C.A.5 2006) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>[8]  The opinion also referred to a proposition that \"cannot fairly be denied\u0097that death is a punishment different from all other sanctions in kind rather than degree,\" and continued on to conclude that \"[a] process that accords no significance to relevant facets of the character and record of the individual offender or the circumstances of the particular offense excludes from consideration in fixing the ultimate punishment of death the possibility of compassionate or mitigating factors stemming from the diverse frailties of humankind.\" <i>Woodson,</i> 428 U.S., at 303-304, 96 S.Ct. 2978.</p>\n<p>[9]  \"By authorizing the defense to bring before the jury at the separate sentencing hearing whatever mitigating circumstances relating to the individual defendant can be adduced, Texas has ensured that the sentencing jury will have adequate guidance to enable it to perform its sentencing function.\" <i>Jurek,</i> 428 U.S., at 276, 96 S.Ct. 2950 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.); see also <i>Proffitt,</i> 428 U.S., at 257-258, 96 S.Ct. 2960 (same).</p>\n<p>[10]  In <i>Penry I</i> itself, the Court noted that the rule sought by Penry\u0097\"that when such mitigating evidence is presented, Texas juries must, upon request, be given jury instructions that make it possible for them to give effect to that mitigating evidence in determining whether the death penalty should be imposed\u0097is not a `new rule' under <i>Teague</i> [<i>v. Lane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989),] because it is dictated by <i>Eddings</i> and <i>Lockett.</i>\" 492 U.S., at 318-319, 109 S.Ct. 2934.</p>\n<p>[11]  See Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 2929.04(B)(7) (Anderson 1982) (amended 1981) (adding, as a mitigating circumstance, \"[a]ny other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death\").</p>\n<p>[12]  To the extent that <i>Jurek</i> implied at the time it was decided that all that was required by the Constitution was that the defense be authorized to introduce all relevant mitigating circumstances, and that such information merely be before the jury, it has become clear from our later cases that the mere ability to present evidence is not sufficient. The only mitigating evidence presented in <i>Jurek</i>\u0097offered to rebut the State's witnesses' testimony about Jurek's bad reputation in the community\u0097appears to have consisted of Jurek's father's testimony that Jurek had \"always been steadily employed since he had left school and that he contributed to his family's support.\" 428 U.S., at 267, 96 S.Ct. 2950. Therefore, the question presented in our later cases\u0097 namely, whether the jury was precluded from giving meaningful effect to mitigating evidence, particularly that which may go to a defendant's lack of moral culpability\u0097was not at issue in that case. When we deemed the Texas sentencing scheme constitutionally adequate in <i>Jurek,</i> we clearly failed to anticipate that when faced with various other types of mitigating evidence, the Texas special issues would not provide the sentencing jury with the requisite \"adequate guidance.\"</p>\n<p>[13]  In <i>Jurek v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109534\"><a href=\"/opinion/109534/jurek-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976), this Court held that the Texas capital sentencing procedures satisfied the Eighth Amendment requirement that the sentencer be allowed to consider circumstances mitigating against capital punishment. It was observed that even though the statute did not explicitly mention mitigating circumstances, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had construed the special verdict question regarding the defendant's future dangerousness to permit jury consideration of the defendant's prior criminal record, age, mental state, and the circumstances of the crime in mitigation. <i>Id.,</i> at 271-273, 96 S.Ct. 2950. Since the decision in <i>Jurek,</i> we have emphasized that the Constitution guarantees a defendant facing a possible death sentence not only the right to introduce evidence mitigating against the death penalty but also the right to <i>consideration</i> of that evidence by the sentencing authority. <i>Lockett v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), established that a State may not prevent the capital sentencing authority \"from giving <i>independent mitigating weight</i> to aspects of the defendant's character and record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 605, 98 S.Ct. 2954 (plurality opinion). We reaffirmed this conclusion in <i>Eddings v. Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110641\"><a href=\"/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), and in <i>Hitchcock v. Dugger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111871\"><a href=\"/opinion/111871/hitchcock-v-dugger/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 107 S.Ct. 1821, 95 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987). <i>Franklin,</i> 487 U.S., at 183-184, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[14]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent incorrectly assumes that our holding today adopts the rule advocated by the petitioner in <i>Graham v. Collins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112810\"><a href=\"/opinion/112810/graham-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 892, 122 L.Ed.2d 260 (1993), namely, that \"`a defendant is entitled to special instructions whenever he can offer mitigating evidence that has <i>some</i> arguable relevance beyond the special issues.'\" <i>Post,</i> at 1678 (quoting <i>Graham,</i> 506 U.S., at 476, 113 S.Ct. 892; emphasis in <i>Graham</i>). The rule that we reaffirm today\u0097a rule that has been clearly established since our decision in <i>Penry I</i>\u0097is this: Special instructions are necessary when the jury could not otherwise give <i>meaningful effect</i> to a defendant's mitigating evidence. The rule is narrower than the standard urged by Graham because special instruction is not required when mitigating evidence has only a tenuous connection\u0097\"<i>some</i> arguable relevance\"\u0097to the defendant's moral culpability. But special instruction is necessary when the defendant's evidence may have meaningful relevance to the defendant's moral culpability \"beyond the scope of the special issues.\" <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S., at 322-323, 109 S.Ct. 2934. Despite the dissent's colorful rhetoric, it cites no post-<i>Penry I</i> cases inconsistent with this reading of its holding.</p>\n<p>[15]  In <i>Franklin,</i> however, the five concurring and dissenting Justices did not share the plurality's categorical reading of <i>Jurek.</i> In the plurality's view, <i>Jurek</i> had expressly and unconditionally upheld the manner in which mitigating evidence is considered under the special issues. <i>Id.,</i> at 179-180, and n. 10, 108 S.Ct. 2320. In contrast, five Members of the Court read <i>Jurek</i> as not precluding a claim that, in a particular case, the jury was unable to fully consider the mitigating evidence introduced by a defendant in answering the special issues. 487 U.S., at 183, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 199-200, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). \"Indeed, both the concurrence and the dissent understood <i>Jurek</i> as resting fundamentally on the express assurance that the special issues would permit the jury to fully consider all the mitigating evidence a defendant introduced that was relevant to the defendant's background and character and to the circumstances of the offense.\" <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S., at 320-321, 109 S.Ct. 2934; see also <i>id.,</i> at 318, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (\"[T]he facial validity of the Texas death penalty statute had been upheld in <i>Jurek</i> on the basis of assurances that the special issues would be interpreted broadly enough to enable sentencing juries to consider all of the relevant mitigating evidence a defendant might present\").</p>\n<p>[16]  It is also clear that <i>Penry I</i> applies in cases involving evidence that is neither double edged nor purely aggravating, because in some cases a defendant's evidence may have mitigating effect beyond its ability to negate the special issues. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Tennard v. Dretke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136994\"><a href=\"/opinion/136994/tennard-v-dretke-director-texas-department-of-crim/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 288-289, 124 S.Ct. 2562, 159 L.Ed.2d 384 (2004) (holding that petitioner was entitled to a COA on his <i>Penry</i> claim where his evidence of low IQ and impaired intellectual functioning had \"mitigating dimension beyond the impact it has on the individual's ability to act deliberately\"). In <i>Tennard,</i> the majority declined to accept the dissent's argument that the petitioner's evidence of low intelligence did \"not necessarily create the <i>Penry I</i> `two-edged sword,'\" and therefore could be given adequate mitigating effect within the context of the future dangerousness special issue. 542 U.S., at 293, 124 S.Ct. 2562 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). Cf. <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112897\"><a href=\"/opinion/112897/johnson-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 386, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), in turn citing <i>Penry I,</i> 492 U.S., at 355, 109 S.Ct. 2934 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"The Court today holds that `the constitutionality turns on whether the [special] questions allow mitigating factors not only to be considered ..., <i>but also to be given effect in all possible ways, including ways that the questions do not permit</i>'\" (emphasis in original)); cf. also <i>Smith v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137727\"><a href=\"/opinion/137727/smith-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 41, 46-48, 125 S.Ct. 400, 160 L.Ed.2d 303 (2004) <i>(per curiam)</i> (reversing the CCA's denial of postconviction relief because the special issues did not provide an adequate vehicle for expressing a \"`reasoned moral response'\" to petitioner's evidence of low IQ and a troubled upbringing).</p>\n<p>[17]  The lynchpin of THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent is his assumption that Justice O'Connor's opinions in <i>Franklin</i> and <i>Penry I</i> merely described two ad hoc judgments\u0097see <i>post,</i> at 1675-1676, 1677-1678\u0097rather than her understanding of the governing rule of law announced in <i>Lockett, Eddings,</i> and <i>Hitchcock v. Dugger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111871\"><a href=\"/opinion/111871/hitchcock-v-dugger/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 107 S.Ct. 1821, 95 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987). In his view, our line of cases in this area has flip-flopped, depending on the composition of the majority, rather than slowly defining core principles by eliminating those interpretations of the rule that are unsupportable. The fact that Justice O'Connor's understanding of the law was confirmed by the Court in <i>Penry I</i> in 1989\u0097 well before AEDPA was enacted\u0097is a sufficient response to most of the rhetoric in the dissent. Neither Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court in <i>Penry I,</i> nor any other opinion she joined, ever endorsed the \"`<i>some</i> arguable relevance'\" position described by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, see <i>post,</i> at 1678, 1383, which mistakenly interprets our opinion as adopting the rule that the dissenters in <i>Franklin</i> and <i>Saffle</i> would have chosen, see <i>post,</i> at 1678, 1683. The fact that the Court never endorsed that broader standard is fully consistent with our conclusion that the narrower rule applied in <i>Penry I</i> itself is \"clearly established.\" Arguments advanced in later dissenting opinions do not affect that conclusion.</p>\n<p>[18]  The Texas cases relied upon by the court were <i>Garcia v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2459967\"><a href=\"/opinion/2459967/garcia-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">919</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 398-399 (Tex.Crim.App.1996) (en banc) (holding that, in light of the fact that Garcia received a <i>\"Penry\"</i> instruction (included in the amended Texas special issues), which instructed the jury to consider the defendant's character and background in determining whether to impose life rather than death, he was not entitled to any special instructions requiring the jury to consider his drug use, alcoholism, and family background as mitigating evidence); <i>Mines v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1494009\"><a href=\"/opinion/1494009/mines-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 818 (Tex. Crim.App.1994) (en banc) (holding, on remand after <i>Johnson,</i> that Mines' mitigating evidence of bipolar disorder was \"well within the effective reach of the jury\"); and <i>Zimmerman v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1660342\"><a href=\"/opinion/1660342/zimmerman-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span>, 362 (Tex.Crim. App. 1994) (en banc) (holding, also on remand after <i>Johnson,</i> that Zimmerman's \"mitigating\" evidence of low IQ, past substance abuse, a diagnosis of paranoid personality disorder, and a disruptive family environment did not warrant an additional instruction under <i>Johnson</i> or <i>Penry I</i>).</p>\n<p>[19]  Graham claimed that the Texas system had not \"allowed for adequate consideration of mitigating evidence concerning his youth, family background, and positive character traits\"; in <i>Johnson,</i> we declined to adopt such a rule, even without the <i>Teague</i> bar that prevented us from doing so in <i>Graham.</i> 509 U.S., at 365-366, 113 S.Ct. 2658.</p>\n<p>[20]  This fact should be reassuring to those who fear that the rule we endorse today\u0097and which we have endorsed since <i>Penry I</i>\u0097 \"would require a new sentencing in every case.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1679 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[21]  A jury may be precluded from doing so not only as a result of the instructions it is given, but also as a result of prosecutorial argument dictating that such consideration is forbidden. See Part VI, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>[22]  Because THE CHIEF JUSTICE's only concern is with the proper application of AEDPA, he finds it unnecessary to define the rule that he thinks post-<i>Penry I</i> cases either did or should have applied. What is most relevant under AEDPA, however, is the holdings set forth in majority opinions, rather than the views of dissenters who supported a different understanding of the law at the time those opinions were written.</p>\n<p>[23]  We came to the same conclusion in <i>Graham,</i> after distinguishing the defendant's mitigating evidence in that case from that offered by the defendant in <i>Penry I:</i>\n</p>\n<p>\"The jury was not forbidden to accept the suggestion of Graham's lawyers that his brief spasm of criminal activity in May 1981 was properly viewed, in light of his youth, his background, and his character, as an aberration that was not likely to be repeated. Even if Graham's evidence, like Penry's, had significance beyond the scope of the first special issue, it is apparent that Graham's evidence\u0097 <i>unlike</i> Penry's\u0097had mitigating relevance to the second special issue concerning his likely future dangerousness. Whereas Penry's evidence compelled an affirmative answer to that inquiry, despite its mitigating significance, Graham's evidence quite readily could have supported a negative answer.\" 506 U.S., at 475-476, 113 S.Ct. 892.</p>\n<p>[24]  In <i>Graham,</i> we acknowledged that <i>Penry I</i> did not \"effec[t] a sea change in this Court's view of the constitutionality of the former Texas death penalty statute.\" <i>Graham,</i> 506 U.S., at 474, 113 S.Ct. 892. The reason, of course, that this was not the case is because the rule set forth in <i>Penry I</i> was merely an application of the settled <i>Lockett-Eddings-Hitchcock</i> rule described by Justice O'Connor in her opinions.</p>\n<p>[25]  Without making any attempt to explain how the jury in either this case or in <i>Brewer v. Quarterman,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1706, 167 L.Ed.2d 622, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"45979\"><a href=\"/opinion/45979/brewer-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1201609</span></a></span>, could have given \"meaningful effect\" or a \"reasoned moral response\" to either defendant's mitigating evidence, THE CHIEF JUSTICE concludes his dissent by lamenting the fact that the views shared by Justice O'Connor's concurrence and the dissenters in <i>Franklin</i> in 1988\u0097and later endorsed in <i>Penry I</i>\u0097\"actually represented `clearly established' federal law at that time.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1684. To his credit, his concluding sentence does not go so far as to state that he favors a <i>\"tunc pro nunc\"</i> rejection of those views, an endorsement of the views expressed by the four dissenters in <i>Penry I,</i> or even agreement with the Fifth Circuit's recently rejected test for identifying relevant mitigating evidence. See <i>Nelson v. Quarterman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"40768\"><a href=\"/opinion/40768/nelson-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span>, 291-293 (2006) (en banc) (recognizing the \"now-defunct\" nature of the Fifth Circuit's \"`constitutional-relevance' test\" post-<i>Tennard</i> and that a \"`full-effect'\" standard\u0097meaning that \"a juror be able to express his reasoned moral response to evidence that has mitigating relevance beyond the scope of the special issues\"\u0097was \"clearly established\" for purposes of AEDPA in 1994, when Nelson's conviction became final).</p>\n<p>[1]  In evaluating the state court's analysis, the Court criticizes its reliance on <i>Graham</i> because <i>Graham</i> primarily addressed retroactivity under <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). <i>Ante,</i> at 1671. But in considering whether the rule requested was dictated by precedent, <i>Graham</i> of course had to evaluate the scope of that precedent\u0097including <i>Penry I</i>\u0097and did so extensively. See 506 U.S., at 467-477, 113 S.Ct. 892. Moreover, as explained below, the Court in <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112897\"><a href=\"/opinion/112897/johnson-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 370-372, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993), adopted the same reading of <i>Penry I</i> adopted in <i>Graham,</i> without considering the issue under <i>Teague.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  The Court is correct that \"[w]hat is most relevant under AEDPA ... is the holdings set forth in majority opinions, rather than the views of dissenters ... at the time those opinions were written.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1672, n. 22. But that must include the majority opinions in all the pertinent cases, not just the lone one of the bunch that ruled in favor of the defendant. Here it must include the subsequent majority opinions in <i>Saffle, Graham,</i> and <i>Johnson,</i> as well as in <i>Penry I,</i> and it was not objectively unreasonable for a state court to view <i>Saffle, Graham,</i> and <i>Johnson</i> the same way today's author did at the time\u0097or at least to conclude that the Court's current view of <i>Penry I</i> was not as clearly established as the Court would have it today.</p>\n<p>[3]  The Court criticizes this dissent for failing \"to define the rule\" that our post-<i>Penry I</i> cases either did or should have applied. <i>Ante,</i> at 1672, n. 22. But the whole point is that \"the rule,\" far from being \"clearly established\" by our decisions, was \u0097 at the very least \u0097 unsettled and confused. Under AEDPA, those defending the finality of a state-court judgment challenged on federal habeas review do not have to show that the state-court judgment was consistent with some version of \"clearly established Federal law\" other than that offered by the challenger; AEDPA obviously contemplates that there <i>may not be</i> \"clearly established Federal law.\" The Court's criticism only underscores how far the reasoning employed today strays from AEDPA's mandate.</p>\n<p>[*]  Relatedly, the Court thinks <i>Johnson</i> distinguishable because jurors have \"experienced\" youth but \"have never experienced\" the \"particularized childhood experiences of abuse and neglect\" at issue here. <i>Abdul-Kabir, ante,</i> at 1672-1673. It is again quite impossible to understand, however, how that can have any bearing upon whether \"some effect\" or \"full effect\" is the required test.</p>\n\n</div>",
