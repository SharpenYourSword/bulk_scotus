Marcus, Assistant to the Solicitor General, Daniel S. Goodman, Attorney, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for United States.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), provides that a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of \u00a7 922(g), is subject to a mandatory sentence of 15 years of imprisonment if the defendant has three prior convictions \"for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\"</p>\n<p>The question before us is whether attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, is a \"violent felony\" under ACCA. We hold that it is, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Alphonso James pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony, in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1). In his guilty plea, James admitted to the three prior felony convictions listed in his federal indictment. These included a conviction in Florida state court for attempted burglary of a dwelling, in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 810.02 and 777.04.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>At sentencing, the Government argued that James was subject to ACCA's 15-year mandatory minimum term because of his three prior convictions. James objected, arguing that his attempted burglary conviction did not qualify as a \"violent felony\" under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The District Court held that attempted burglary is a violent felony, and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed that holding, 430 F.3d 1150, 1157 (2005). We granted certiorari, 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2860, 165 L.Ed.2d 894 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>ACCA's 15-year mandatory minimum applies \"[i]n the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title [the felon in possession of a firearm provision] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1591</span> and has three prior convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(1). ACCA defines a \"violent felony\" as</p>\n<blockquote>\"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that \u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 924(2)(B).</blockquote>\n<p>Florida defined the crime of burglary at the time of James' conviction as follows: \"`Burglary' means entering or remaining in a structure or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter or remain.\" Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(1) (1993). Florida's criminal attempt statute provided: \"A person who attempts to commit an offense prohibited by law and in such attempt does any act toward the commission of such offense, but fails in the perpetration or is intercepted or prevented in the execution thereof, commits the offense of criminal attempt.\" \u00a7 777.04(1). The attempted burglary conviction at issue here was punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</p>\n<p>The parties agree that attempted burglary does not qualify as a \"violent felony\" under clause (i) of ACCA's definition because it does not have \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Nor does it qualify as one of the specific crimes enumerated in clause (ii). Attempted burglary is not robbery or extortion. It does not involve the use of explosives. And it is not \"burglary\" because it does not meet the definition of burglary under ACCA that this Court set forth in <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990): \"an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\" See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 777.04(1) (crime of attempt under Florida law requires as an element that the defendant \"fai[l] in the perpetration or [be] intercepted or prevented in the execution\" of the underlying offense).</p>\n<p>The question before the Court, then, is whether attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, falls within ACCA's residual provision for crimes that \"otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Before determining whether the elements of attempted burglary under Florida law qualify under ACCA's residual provision, we first consider James' argument that the statute's text and structure categorically exclude attempt offenses from the scope of the residual provision. We conclude that nothing in the plain language of clause (ii), when read together with the rest of the statute, prohibits attempt offenses from qualifying as ACCA predicates when they involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n<p>James first argues that the residual provision of clause (ii) must be read in conjunction with clause (i), which expressly includes in its definition of \"violent felony\" offenses that have \"as an element the ... <i>attempted use</i> ... of physical force against another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added). James thus concludes that Congress' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1592</span> express inclusion of attempt offenses in clause (i), combined with its failure to mention attempts in clause (ii), demonstrates an intent to categorically exclude attempt offenses from the latter provision.</p>\n<p>We are not persuaded. James' reading would unduly narrow clause (ii)'s residual provision, the language of which does not suggest any intent to exclude attempt offenses that otherwise meet the statutory criteria. Clause (i), in contrast, lacks a broad residual provision, thus making it necessary to specify exactly what types of offenses \u0097 including attempt offenses \u0097 are covered by its language. In short, \"the expansive phrasing of\" clause (ii) \"points directly away from the sort of exclusive specification\" that James would read into it. <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal,</i> 536 U.S. 73, 80, 122 S.Ct. 2045, 153 L.Ed.2d 82 (2002); see also <i>United States v. Davis,</i> 16 F.3d 212, 217(CA7) (rejecting argument that \"had Congress wished to include attempted burglary as a \u00a7 924(e) predicate offense, it would have done so expressly\" as \"untenable in light of the very existence of the `otherwise' clause, which Congress plainly intended to serve as a catch-all provision\"), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 945, 115 S.Ct. 354, 130 L.Ed.2d 309 (1994).</p>\n<p>James next invokes the canon of <i>ejusdem generis</i> \u0097 that when a general phrase follows a list of specifics, it should be read to include only things of the same type as those specifically enumerated. He argues that the \"common attribute\" of the offenses specifically enumerated in clause (ii) \u0097 burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives \u0097 is that they are all completed offenses. The residual provision, he contends, should similarly be read to extend only to completed offenses.</p>\n<p>This argument is unavailing. As an initial matter, the premise on which it depends \u0097 that clause (ii)'s specifically enumerated crimes are limited to completed offenses \u0097 is false. An unsuccessful attempt to blow up a government building, for example, would qualify as a specifically enumerated predicate offense because it would \"involv[e][the] use of explosives.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 844(f)(1) (making it a crime to \"maliciously damag[e] or destro[y], or <i>attemp[t]</i> to damage or destroy, by means of fire or an explosive,\" certain property used in or affecting interstate commerce (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>In any event, the most relevant common attribute of the enumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives use is not \"completion.\" Rather, it is that all of these offenses, while not technically crimes against the person, nevertheless create significant risks of bodily injury or confrontation that might result in bodily injury. As we noted in <i>Taylor,</i></p>\n<blockquote>\"Congress thought that certain general categories of property crimes \u0097 namely burglary, arson, extortion, and the use of explosives \u0097 so often presented a risk of injury to persons, or were so often committed by career criminals, that they should be included in the enhancement statute even though, considered solely in terms of their statutory elements, they do not necessarily involve the use or threat of force against a person.\" 495 U.S., at 597, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</blockquote>\n<p>See also <i>id.,</i> at 588, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (noting that Congress singled out burglary because it \"often creates the possibility of a violent confrontation\"); <i>United States v. Adams,</i> 51 Fed.Appx. 507, 508 (C.A.6 2002) (arson presents \"a serious risk of physical injury to another\" because \"[n]ot only might the targeted building be occupied,\" but also \"the fire could harm firefighters and onlookers and could spread to occupied structures\"); H.R.Rep. No. 99-849, p. 3 (1986) (purpose of clause (ii) was to \"add State and Federal crimes against property <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1593</span> such as burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives and similar crimes as predicate offenses where the conduct involved presents a serious risk of injury to a person\").</p>\n<p>Congress' inclusion of a broad residual provision in clause (ii) indicates that it did not intend the preceding enumerated offenses to be an exhaustive list of the types of crimes that might present a serious risk of injury to others and therefore merit status as a \u00a7 924(e) predicate offense. Nothing in the statutory language supports the view that Congress intended to limit this category solely to completed offenses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>James also relies on ACCA's legislative history to buttress his argument that clause (ii) categorically excludes attempt offenses. In the deliberations leading up to ACCA's adoption in 1984, the House rejected a version of the statute that would have provided enhanced penalties for use of a firearm by persons with two prior convictions for \"any robbery or burglary offense, <i>or a conspiracy or attempt to commit such an offense.</i>\" S. 52, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 2 (1984) (emphasis added). The bill that ultimately became law omitted any reference to attempts, and simply defined \"violent felony\" to include \"robbery or burglary, or both.\" Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, \u00a7 1802, 98 Stat. 2185, repealed in 1986 by Pub.L. 99-308, \u00a7 104(b), 100 Stat. 459. James argues that Congress' rejection of this explicit \"attempt\" language in 1984 evidenced an intent to exclude attempted burglary as a predicate offense.</p>\n<p>Whatever weight this legislative history might ordinarily have, we do not find it probative here, because the 1984 enactment on which James relies was not Congress' last word on the subject. In 1986, Congress amended ACCA for the purpose of \"`expanding' the range of predicate offenses.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 584, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The 1986 amendments added the more expansive language that is at issue in this case \u0097 including clause (ii)'s language defining as violent felonies offenses that are \"burglary, arson, extortion, involv[e] use of explosives, or otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" Career Criminals Amendment Act of 1986, \u00a7 1402(b), 100 Stat. 3207-40, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This language is substantially broader than the 1984 provision that it amended. Because both the Government and the Court of Appeals relied on the broader language of the 1986 amendments \u0097 specifically, the residual provision \u0097 as the textual basis for including attempted burglary within the law's scope, Congress' rejection of express language including attempt offenses in the 1984 provision is not dispositive. Congress did not consider, much less reject, any such language when it enacted the 1986 amendments. What it did consider, and ultimately adopted, was a broadly worded residual clause that does not by its terms exclude attempt offenses, and whose reach is broad enough to encompass at least some such offenses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Having concluded that neither the statutory text nor the legislative history discloses any congressional intent to categorically exclude attempt offenses from the scope of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)'s residual provision, we next ask whether attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, is an offense that \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" In answering this question, we employ the \"`categorical approach'\" that this Court has taken with respect to other offenses under ACCA. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1594</span> Under this approach, we \"`look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense,'\" and do not generally consider the \"particular facts disclosed by the record of conviction.\" <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 17, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (quoting <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143). That is, we consider whether the <i>elements of the offense</i> are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We begin by examining what constitutes attempted burglary under Florida law. On its face, Florida's attempt statute requires only that a defendant take \"any act toward the commission\" of burglary. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 777.04(1). James contends that this broad statutory language sweeps in merely preparatory activity that poses no real danger of harm to others \u0097 for example, acquiring burglars' tools or casing a structure while planning a burglary.</p>\n<p>But while the statutory language is broad, the Florida Supreme Court has considerably narrowed its application in the context of attempted burglary, requiring an \"overt act directed toward entering or remaining in a structure or conveyance.\" <i>Jones v. State,</i> 608 So.2d 797, 799 (1992). Mere preparation is not enough. See <i>ibid.</i><sup>[2]</sup> Florida's lower courts appear to have consistently applied this heightened standard. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Richardson v. State,</i> 922 So.2d 331, 334 (App.2006); <i>Davis v. State,</i> 741 So.2d 1213, 1214 (App.1999).</p>\n<p>The pivotal question, then, is whether overt conduct directed toward unlawfully entering or remaining in a dwelling, with the intent to commit a felony therein, is \"conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In answering this question, we look to the statutory language for guidance. The specific offenses enumerated in clause (ii) provide one baseline from which to measure whether other similar conduct \"otherwise... presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" In this case, we can ask whether the risk posed by attempted burglary is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses \u0097 here, completed burglary. See <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 600, n. 9, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (\"The Government remains free to argue that any offense \u0097 including offenses similar to generic burglary \u0097 should count towards enhancement as one that `otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another' under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\").</p>\n<p>The main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another's property, but rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party \u0097 whether an occupant, a police officer, or a bystander \u0097 who comes to investigate. That is, the risk arises not from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1595</span> the completion of the burglary, but from the possibility that an innocent person might appear while the crime is in progress.</p>\n<p>Attempted burglary poses the same kind of risk. Interrupting an intruder at the doorstep while the would-be burglar is attempting a break-in creates a risk of violent confrontation comparable to that posed by finding him inside the structure itself. As one court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In all of these cases the risk of injury arises, not from the completion of the break-in, but rather from the possibility that some innocent party may appear on the scene while the break-in is occurring. This is just as likely to happen before the defendant succeeds in breaking in as after. Indeed, the possibility may be at its peak while the defendant is still outside trying to break in, as that is when he is likely to be making noise and exposed to the public view ... . [T]here is a serious risk of confrontation while a perpetrator is attempting to enter the building.\" <i>United States v. Payne,</i> 966 F.2d 4, 8 (C.A.1 1992).</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, the risk posed by an attempted burglary that can serve as the basis for an ACCA enhancement may be even greater than that posed by a typical completed burglary. All burglaries begin as attempted burglaries. But ACCA only concerns that subset of attempted burglaries where the offender has been apprehended, prosecuted, and convicted. This will typically occur when the attempt is thwarted by some outside intervenor \u0097 be it a property owner or law enforcement officer. Many completed burglaries do not involve such confrontations. But attempted burglaries often do; indeed, it is often just such outside intervention that prevents the attempt from ripening into completion.</p>\n<p>Concluding that attempted burglary presents a risk that is comparable to the risk posed by the completed offense, every Court of Appeals that has construed an attempted burglary law similar in scope to Florida's has held that the offense qualifies as a \"violent felony\" under clause (ii)'s residual provision.<sup>[3]</sup> The only cases holding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1596</span> to the contrary involved attempt laws that could be satisfied by preparatory conduct that does not pose the same risk of violent confrontation and physical harm posed by an attempt to enter a structure illegally.<sup>[4]</sup> Given that Florida law, as interpreted by that State's highest court, requires an overt act directed toward the entry of a structure, we need not consider whether the more attenuated conduct encompassed by such laws presents a potential risk of serious injury under ACCA.</p>\n<p>The United States Sentencing Commission has come to a similar conclusion with regard to the Sentencing Guidelines' career offender enhancement, whose definition of a predicate \"crime of violence\" closely tracks ACCA's definition of \"violent felony.\" See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (Nov.2006) (USSG). The Commission has determined that \"crime[s] of violence\" for the purpose of the Guidelines enhancement \"include the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.\" \u00a7 4B1.2, comment., n. 1. This judgment was based on the Commission's review of empirical sentencing data and presumably reflects an assessment that attempt crimes often pose a similar risk of injury as completed offenses. As then-Judge Breyer explained, \"[t]he Commission, which collects detailed sentencing data on virtually every federal criminal case, is better able than any individual court to make an informed judgment about the relation between\" a particular offense and \"the likelihood of accompanying violence.\" <i>United States v. Doe,</i> 960 F.2d 221, 225 (C.A.1 1992); see also USSG \u00a7 1A3 (Nov.1987), reprinted in \u00a7 1A1.1 comment. (Nov. 2006) (describing empirical basis of Commission's formulation of Guidelines); <i>United States v. Chambers,</i> 473 F.3d 724 (C.A.7 2007) (noting the usefulness of empirical analysis from the Commission in determining whether an unenumerated crime poses a risk of violence). While we are not bound by the Sentencing Commission's conclusion, we view it as further evidence that a crime like attempted burglary poses a risk of violence similar to that presented by the completed offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>James responds that it is not enough that attempted burglary \"`generally'\" or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1597</span> in \"`most cases'\" will create a risk of physical injury to others. Brief for Petitioner 32. Citing the categorical approach we employed in <i>Taylor,</i> he argues that we cannot treat attempted burglary as an ACCA predicate offense unless <i>all</i> cases present such a risk. James' approach is supported by neither the statute's text nor this Court's holding in <i>Taylor.</i></p>\n<p>One could, of course, imagine a situation in which attempted burglary might not pose a realistic risk of confrontation or injury to anyone \u0097 for example, a break-in of an unoccupied structure located far off the beaten path and away from any potential intervenors. But ACCA does not require metaphysical certainty. Rather, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)'s residual provision speaks in terms of a \"potential risk.\" These are inherently probabilistic concepts.<sup>[5]</sup> Indeed, the combination of the two terms suggests that Congress intended to encompass possibilities even more contingent or remote than a simple \"risk,\" much less a certainty. While there may be some attempted burglaries that do not present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, the same is true of completed burglaries \u0097 which are explicitly covered by the statutory language and provide a baseline against which to measure the degree of risk that a non-enumerated offense must \"otherwise\" present in order to qualify.</p>\n<p>James' argument also misapprehends <i>Taylor's</i> categorical approach. We do not view that approach as requiring that every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony. Cf. <i>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 815, 822, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007) (\"[T]o find that a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute's language. It requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime\").</p>\n<p>Rather, the proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another. One can always hypothesize unusual cases in which even a prototypically violent crime might not present a genuine risk of injury \u0097 for example, an attempted murder where the gun, unbeknownst to the shooter, had no bullets, see <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 361 F.3d 653, 659 (C.A.D.C.2004). Or, to take an example from the offenses specifically enumerated in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), one could imagine an extortion scheme where an anonymous blackmailer threatens to release embarrassing personal information about the victim unless he is mailed regular payments. In both cases, the risk of physical injury to another approaches zero. But that does not mean that the offenses of attempted murder or extortion are categorically nonviolent.</p>\n<p>As long as an offense is of a type that, by its nature, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another, it satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)'s residual provision. Attempted burglary under Florida law \u0097 as construed in <i>Jones</i> to require <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1598</span> an overt act directed toward entry of a structure \u0097 satisfies this test.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>Justice SCALIA's dissent criticizes our approach on the ground that it does not provide sufficient guidance for lower courts required to decide whether unenumerated offenses other than attempted burglary qualify as violent felonies under ACCA. But the dissent's alternative approach has more serious disadvantages. Among other things, that approach unnecessarily decides an important question that the parties have not briefed (the meaning of the term \"extortion\" in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)), decides that question in a way that is hardly free from doubt, and fails to provide an interpretation of the residual provision that furnishes clear guidance for future cases.</p>\n<p>The dissent interprets the residual provision to require at least as much risk as the least dangerous enumerated offense. But the ordinary meaning of the language of the residual clause does not impose such a requirement. What the clause demands is \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" While it may be reasonable to infer that the risks presented by the enumerated offenses involve a risk of this magnitude, it does not follow that an offense that presents a lesser risk necessarily fails to qualify. Nothing in the language of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) rules out the possibility that an offense may present \"a serious risk of physical injury to another\" without presenting as great a risk as any of the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even if an unenumerated offense could not qualify without presenting at least as much risk as the least risky of the enumerated offenses, it would not be necessary to identify the least risky of those offenses in order to decide this case. Rather, it would be sufficient to establish simply that the unenumerated offense presented at least as much risk as one of the enumerated offenses. Thus, Justice SCALIA's interpretation of the meaning of the term \"extortion\" is unnecessary \u0097 and inadvisable. The parties have not briefed this issue, and the proposed interpretation is hardly beyond question. Instead of interpreting the meaning of the term \"extortion\" in accordance with its meaning at common law or in modern federal and state statutes, see <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, it is suggested that we adopt an interpretation that seems to be entirely novel and that greatly reduces the reach of ACCA.</p>\n<p>The stated reason for tackling this question is to provide guidance for the lower courts in future cases \u0097 surely a worthy objective. But in practical terms, the proposed interpretation of the residual clause would not make it much easier for the lower courts to decide whether other unenumerated offenses qualify. Without hard statistics \u0097 and no such statistics have been called to our attention \u0097 how is a lower court to determine whether the risk posed by generic burglary is greater or less than the risk posed by an entirely unrelated unenumerated offense \u0097 say, escape from prison?<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1599</span> In the end, Justice SCALIA's analysis of this case turns on the same question as ours \u0097 <i>i.e.,</i> the comparative risks presented by burglary and attempted burglary. The risk of physical injury in both cases occurs when there is a confrontation between the criminal and another person, whether an occupant of the structure, a law enforcement officer or security guard, or someone else. It is argued that when such an encounter occurs during a consummated burglary (<i>i.e.,</i> after entry), the risk is greater than it is when the encounter occurs during an attempted burglary (<i>i.e.,</i> before entry is effected), and that may be true. But this argument fails to come to grips with the fact that such encounters may occur much more frequently during attempted burglaries because it is precisely due to such encounters that many planned burglaries do not progress beyond the attempt stage. Justice SCALIA dismisses the danger involved when an encounter occur during attempted burglaries, stating that such encounters are \"likely to consist of nothing more than the occupant's yelling, `Who's there?' from his window, and the burglar's running away.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1607. But there are many other possible scenarios. An armed would-be burglar may be spotted by a police officer, a private security guard, or a participant in a neighborhood watch program. Or a homeowner angered by the sort of conduct recited in James' presentence report \u0097 throwing a hammer through a window \u0097 may give chase, and a violent encounter may ensue. For these reasons and the reasons discussed above, we are convinced that the offense of attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, qualifies under ACCA's residual clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Although the question on which this Court granted certiorari focused on the attempt prong of Florida's attempted burglary law, James also argues that the scope of the State's underlying burglary statute itself precludes treating attempted burglary as a violent felony for ACCA purposes. Specifically, he argues that Florida's burglary statute differs from \"generic\" burglary as defined in <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, because it defines a \"`[d]welling'\" to include not only the structure itself, but also the \"curtilage thereof,\"<sup>[7]</sup> Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.011(2) (1993).</p>\n<p>We agree that the inclusion of curtilage takes Florida's underlying offense of burglary outside the definition of \"generic burglary\" set forth in <i>Taylor,</i> which requires an unlawful entry into, or remaining in, \"a <i>building or other structure.</i>\" 495 U.S., at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (emphasis added). But that conclusion is not dispositive, because the Government does not argue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1600</span> that James' conviction for attempted burglary constitutes \"burglary\" under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Rather, it relies on the residual provision of that clause, which \u0097 as the Court has recognized \u0097 can cover conduct that is outside the strict definition of, but nevertheless similar to, generic burglary. <i>Id.,</i> at 600, n. 9, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p>Is the risk posed by an attempted entry of the curtilage comparable to that posed by the attempted entry of a structure (which, as we concluded above, is sufficient to qualify under the residual provision)? We must again turn to state law in order to answer this question.</p>\n<p>The Florida Supreme Court has construed curtilage narrowly, requiring \"some form of an enclosure in order for the area surrounding a residence to be considered part of the `curtilage' as referred to in the burglary statute.\" <i>State v. Hamilton,</i> 660 So.2d 1038, 1044 (1995) (holding that a yard surrounded by trees was not \"curtilage\"); see also <i>United States v. Matthews,</i> 466 F.3d 1271, 1274 (C.A.11 2006) (\"Florida case law construes curtilage narrowly, to include only an enclosed area surrounding a structure\"). Given this narrow definition, we do not believe that the inclusion of curtilage so mitigates the risk presented by attempted burglary as to take the offense outside the scope of clause (ii)'s residual provision.</p>\n<p>A typical reason for enclosing the curtilage adjacent to a structure is to keep out unwanted visitors \u0097 especially those with criminal motives. And a burglar who illegally attempts to enter the enclosed area surrounding a dwelling creates much the same risk of physical confrontation with a property owner, law enforcement official, or other third party as does one who attempts to enter the structure itself. In light of Florida's narrow definition of curtilage, attempted burglary of the curtilage requires both physical proximity to the structure and an overt act directed toward breaching the enclosure. Such an attempt \"presents a serious potential risk that violence will ensue and someone will be injured.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1275 (holding that burglary of the curtilage is a violent felony under ACCA's residual provision).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Finally, James argues that construing attempted burglary as a violent felony raises Sixth Amendment issues under <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny because it is based on \"judicial fact finding\" about the risk presented by \"the acts that underlie `most' convictions for attempted burglary.\" Brief for Petitioner 34, 35. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p>In determining whether attempted burglary under Florida law qualifies as a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), the Court is engaging in statutory interpretation, not judicial factfinding. Indeed, by applying <i>Taylor's</i> categorical approach, we have avoided any inquiry into the underlying facts of James' particular offense, and have looked solely to the elements of attempted burglary as defined by Florida law. Such analysis raises no Sixth Amendment issue.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1601</span> Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice STEVENS and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I disagree with the Court's basic approach in this case, and must therefore lay out my own.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>As the Court acknowledges, <i>ante,</i> at 1591, the only way attempted burglary can qualify as a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) is by falling within the \"residual provision\" of clause (ii) \u0097 that is, if it is a crime that \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This was the basis for the Eleventh Circuit's decision. (\"We ... hold that an attempt to commit burglary ... presents the potential risk of physical injury to another sufficient to satisfy the ACCA's definition of a `violent felony,'\" 430 F.3d 1150, 1157 (2005)), and it is the center of the parties' dispute before this Court.</p>\n<p>The problem with the Court's approach to determining which crimes fit within the residual provision is that it is almost entirely ad hoc. <i>This</i> crime, the Court says, <i>does</i> \"involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" That gets this case off our docket, sure enough. But it utterly fails to do what this Court is supposed to do: provide guidance concrete enough to ensure that the ACCA residual provision will be applied with an acceptable degree of consistency by the hundreds of district judges that impose sentences every day. The one guideline the Court does suggest is that the sentencer should compare the unenumerated offense at issue with the \"closest analog\" among the four offenses that are set forth (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives), and should include the unenumerated offense within ACCA if the risk it poses is \"comparable.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1594. The principal attraction of this test, I suspect, is that it makes it relatively easy to decide the present case (though, as I shall subsequently discuss, I think the Court reaches the wrong conclusion as to whether attempted burglary poses a comparable risk). Assuming that \"comparable\" means \"about the same,\" the Court's test does provide some guidance where the most closely analogous offense is clear (as here) <i>and</i> the risk is comparable. But what if, as will very often be the case, it is not at all obvious which of the four enumerated offenses is the closest analog \u0097 or if (to tell the truth) none of them is analogous at all? Is, for example, driving under the influence of alcohol more analogous to burglary, arson, extortion, or a crime involving use of explosives? And if an analog <i>is</i> identified, what is to be done if the offense at issue does <i>not</i> present a comparable risk? The Court declines to say, but it seems inconceivable that it means the offense to be <i>excluded</i> from ACCA for that reason. For example, it does not comport with any conceivable congressional intent to disqualify an unenumerated crime that is most analogous to arson and presents nowhere near the risk of injury posed by arson, but presents a far <i>greater</i> risk of injury than burglary, which Congress has explicitly included. Thus, for what is probably the vast majority of cases, today's opinion provides no guidance whatever, leaving the lower courts to their own devices in deciding, crime-by-crime, which conviction \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" It will take decades, and dozens of grants of certiorari, to allocate all the Nation's crimes to one or the other side of this entirely reasonable and entirely indeterminate line. Compare <i>ante,</i> at 1595 (concluding that attempted burglary poses sufficient risk), with <i>Leocal v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1602</span> 543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004) (concluding that driving under the influence of alcohol does not pose a \"substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b)).</p>\n<p>Imprecision and indeterminacy are particularly inappropriate in the application of a criminal statute. Years of prison hinge on the scope of ACCA's residual provision, yet its boundaries are ill defined. If we are not going to deny effect to this statute as being impermissibly vague, see Part III, <i>infra,</i> we have the responsibility to derive from the text rules of application that will provide notice of what is covered and prevent arbitrary or discriminatory sentencing. See <i>Kolender v. Lawson,</i> 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983). Offenders should be on notice that a particular course of conduct will result in a mandatory minimum prison term of 15 years. The Court prefers to keep them guessing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The residual provision of clause (ii) of ACCA's definition of violent felony \u0097 the clause that sweeps within ACCA's ambit any crime that \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" \u0097 is, to put it mildly, not a model of clarity. I do not pretend to have an all-encompassing solution that provides for crystal-clear application of the statute in all contexts. But we can do much better than today's opinion with what Congress has given us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Eleventh Circuit properly sought to resolve this case by employing the \"categorical approach\" of looking only to the statutory elements of attempted burglary. See 430 F.3d, at 1154, 1156-1157. This \"generally prohibits the later court from delving into particular facts disclosed by the record of conviction, thus leaving the court normally to `look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.'\" <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 17, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (quoting <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)). As the Court does, <i>ante,</i> at 1594, I would also begin with this approach.</p>\n<p>The Government would have us provide some certainty \u0097 at least enough to decide the present case \u0097 by holding that the attempt to commit a crime of violence should be treated the same as the completed crime. It points out that various federal laws, and many state laws, punish attempt with the same sanction as the completed crime. See Brief for United States 18-20. This would be persuasive if punishment were meted out solely on the basis of the risk of physical injury that a crime presents. It seems to me, however, that similar punishment does not necessarily imply similar risk; it more likely represents a judgment that the two crimes display a similar degree of depravity deserving of punishment or needful of deterrence. A person guilty of attempted burglary may not have placed anyone at physical risk, but he was just as <i>willing</i> to do so as the successful burglar. It seems to me impossible to say that equivalence of punishment suggests equivalence of imposed risk. I therefore look elsewhere for some clarification of the statutory text.</p>\n<p>First to invite analysis is the word Congress placed at the forefront of the residual provision: \"otherwise.\" When used as an adverb (as it is in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), modifying the verb \"involves\"), \"otherwise\" is defined as \"[i]n a different manner\" or \"in another way.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 1729 (2d ed.1954). Thus, the most natural reading of the statute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1603</span> is that committing one of the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving explosives) is <i>one way</i> to commit a crime \"involv[ing] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\"; and that <i>other ways</i> of committing a crime of that character similarly constitute \"violent felon[ies].\" In other words, the enumerated crimes are examples of what Congress had in mind under the residual provision, and the residual provision should be interpreted with those examples in mind. This commonsense principle of construction is sometimes referred to as the canon of <i>ejusdem generis:</i> \"[W]hen a general word or phrase follows a list of specific persons or things, the general word or phrase will be interpreted to include only persons or things of the same type as those listed.\" Black's Law Dictionary 535 (7th ed. 1999) (Black's) see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler,</i> 537 U.S. 371, 384-385, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 154 L.Ed.2d 972 (2003). In this case, the application of that principle suggests that what the residual provision means by the general phrase \"conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" is conduct that resembles, insofar as the degree of such risk is concerned, the previously enumerated crimes.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In another context, I might conclude that any degree of risk that is merely <i>similar,</i> even if <i>slightly less,</i> would qualify. Obviously, such an interpretation would leave a good deal of ambiguity on the downside: How low on the risk scale can one go before the risk becomes <i>too</i> dissimilar from the enumerated crimes? Since the text sets forth no criterion, courts might vary dramatically in their answer. Cf. <i>Leocal,</i> 543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (reversing the Eleventh Circuit's determination that driving under the influence of alcohol qualifies as a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16). Where it is reasonably avoidable, such indeterminateness is unacceptable in the context of criminal sanctions. The rule of lenity, grounded in part on the need to give \"`fair warning'\" of what is encompassed by a criminal statute, <i>United States v. Bass,</i> 404 U.S. 336, 348, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) (quoting <i>McBoyle v. United States,</i> 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931)), demands that we give this text the more narrow reading of which it is susceptible. The requirement that the degree of risk be similar to that for the enumerated crimes means that it be no lesser than the risk posed by the least dangerous of those enumerated crimes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>I would turn, then, to the next logical question: Which of the four enumerated crimes \u0097 burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving use of explosives \u0097 poses the least \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another\"? The two that involve use of fire or explosives cannot possibly qualify. Thus, the question I must address is whether burglary or extortion poses a lesser risk. To do so, I must first define those crimes.</p>\n<p>In <i>Taylor,</i> we defined \"burglary\" as used in the very provision of ACCA at issue here. We first determined that \"`burglary' in \u00a7 924(e) must have some <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1604</span> uniform definition independent of the labels employed by the various States' criminal codes.\" 495 U.S., at 592, 110 S.Ct. 2143. We considered but rejected the common-law definition, finding that \"the contemporary understanding of `burglary' has diverged a long way from its common-law roots.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 593, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Ultimately, we concluded that \"Congress meant by `burglary' the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143. To determine that sense, we looked for guidance to W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) and the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code (1980). We defined \"burglary\" as \"any crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p>In defining \"extortion\" for purposes of ACCA, I would follow the same approach. \"At common law, extortion was a property offense committed by a public official who took `any money or thing of value' that was not due to him under the pretense that he was entitled to such property by virtue of his office.\" <i>Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc.,</i> 537 U.S. 393, 402, 123 S.Ct. 1057, 154 L.Ed.2d 991 (2003) (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 141 (1769), and citing 3 R. Anderson, Wharton's Criminal Law and Procedure \u00a7 1393, pp. 790-791 (1957)); see also 3 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 20.4 (2d ed.2003). As with burglary, however, modern conceptions of extortion have gone well beyond the common-law understanding. In the Hobbs Act, for example, Congress \"explicitly `expanded the common-law definition of extortion to include acts by private individuals.'\" <i>Scheidler, supra,</i> at 402, 123 S.Ct. 1057 (quoting <i>Evans v. United States,</i> 504 U.S. 255, 261, 112 S.Ct. 1881, 119 L.Ed.2d 57 (1992)). And whereas the Hobbs Act retained the common-law requirement that something of value actually be <i>acquired</i> by the extortionist, <i>Scheidler, supra,</i> at 404-405, 123 S.Ct. 1057, the majority of state statutes require only \"that the defendant make a threat with <i>intent</i> thereby to acquire the victim's property,\" 3 LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 20.4(a)(1), at 199 (emphasis added). Further, under most state statutes, the category of qualifying threats has expanded dramatically, to include threats to: \"kill the victim in the future,\" \"cause economic harm,\" \"`bring about or continue a strike, boycott or other collective unofficial action,' \" \"unlawfully detain,\" \"accuse the victim of a crime,\" \"expose some disgraceful defect or secret of the victim which, when known, would subject him to public ridicule or disgrace,\" and \"impair one's credit or business repute.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 20.4(a)(4), at 200, 201.</p>\n<p>The Model Penal Code's definition of \"Theft by Extortion\" reflects this expansive modern notion of the crime:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A person is guilty of theft [by extortion] if he purposely obtains property of another by threatening to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) inflict bodily injury on anyone or commit any other criminal offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) accuse anyone of a criminal offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(3) expose any secret tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or to impair his credit or business repute; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(4) take or withhold action as an official, or cause an official to take or withhold action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(5) bring about or continue a strike, boycott or other collective unofficial action, if the property is not demanded or received for the benefit of the group in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1605</span> whose interest the actor purports to act; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(6) testify or provide information or withhold testimony or information with respect to another's legal claim or defense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(7) inflict any other harm which would not benefit the actor.\" \u00a7 223.4.</blockquote>\n<p>Other federal statutes, including the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, the Travel Act, \u00a7 1952 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), \u00a7 1961 <i>et seq.,</i> use a similarly broad conception of extortion. See <i>United States v. Nardello,</i> 393 U.S. 286, 89 S.Ct. 534, 21 L.Ed.2d 487 (1969) (Travel Act); <i>Scheidler, supra</i> (Hobbs Act and RICO).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The word \"extortion\" in ACCA's definition of \"violent felony\" cannot, however, incorporate the full panoply of threats that would qualify under the Model Penal Code, many of which are inherently nonviolent. I arrive at this conclusion for two reasons: First, another canon of statutory construction, <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> which counsels that \"the meaning of an unclear word or phrase should be determined by the words immediately surrounding it.\" Black's 1084; see <i>Keffeler,</i> 537 U.S., at 384-385, 123 S.Ct. 1017. Of course <i>noscitur a sociis</i> is just an erudite (or some would say antiquated) way of saying what common sense tells us to be true: \"[A] word is known by the company it keeps,\" <i>Jarecki v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co.,</i> 367 U.S. 303, 307, 81 S.Ct. 1579, 6 L.Ed.2d 859 (1961) \u0097 that is to say, which of various possible meanings a word should be given must be determined in a manner that makes it \"fit\" with the words with which it is closely associated. The words immediately surrounding \"extortion\" in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) are \"burglary,\" \"arson,\" and crimes \"involv[ing] use of explosives.\" The Model Penal Code's sweeping definition of extortion would sit uncomfortably indeed amidst this list of crimes which, as the \"otherwise\" residual provision makes plain, are characterized by their potential for violence and their risk of physical harm to others. ACCA's usage of \"extortion\" differs from the context in which the word appears in the Travel Act, where it is one of a list of crimes \"often used by organized crime to collect ... revenue,\" <i>Nardello, supra,</i> at 291, n. 8, 89 S.Ct. 534, including bribery. And it differs from the context in which \"extortion\" appears in RICO, where it is part of a laundry list of nearly every federal crime under the sun. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1606</span> What is suggested by the canon is reinforced by the fact that both the original common-law notion of extortion, and the full expanse of the modern definition, include crimes so inherently <i>unlikely</i> to cause physical harm that it would set the bar of the residual provision at a level that could embrace virtually any offense \u0097 making the limitation to \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" utterly incomprehensible.<sup>[4]</sup> See Part III, <i>infra.</i> I therefore assume that extortion under ACCA is: the obtaining of something of value from another, with his consent, induced by the wrongful use or threatened use of force against the person or property of another. Cf. <i>Leocal,</i> 543 U.S., at 13, 125 S.Ct. 377 (discussing the relationship between the \"use of force against the person or property of another\" and \"crime[s] of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\").</p>\n<p>One final consideration is worthy of mention. I must make sure that my restricted definition of generic extortion does not render the inclusion of extortion in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) superfluous in light of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). \"It is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\" <i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> 533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Clause (i) already includes in ACCA's definition of \"violent felony\" any crime that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" My narrow definition of extortion passes the surplusage test only if it includes crimes that would not be covered by this provision. That is not a problem, since my definition includes the use or threatened use of force against property, whereas clause (i) is limited to force against the person. Thus, the obtaining of someone else's money by threatening to wreck his place of business would fit within clause (ii) but not within clause (i).</p>\n<p>Having defined burglary and extortion, I return to the question that launched this investigation in the first place: Which of the two poses the least \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another\"? Recall the definitions: burglary is the \"unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime\"; extortion is \"the obtaining of something of value from another, with his consent, induced by the wrongful use or threatened use of force against the person or property of another.\" Every victim of extortion is the object of a threat, to his person or his property; if he ignores that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1607</span> threat, or resists it by seeking to protect his property, he may be harmed. Burglary, on the other hand, involves only the <i>possibility</i> that a confrontation will take place while the crime is underway; the risk of physical harm can become a reality only if the property owner happens to be present, a situation which the burglar ordinarily seeks to avoid. The extortionist, moreover, has already expressed his willingness to commit a violent act; the burglar may be prepared to flee at the first sign of human presence. I think it obvious that burglary is less inherently risky than extortion, and thus the least inherently risky of the four crimes enumerated in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Having concluded in Part II-A that a crime may qualify under ACCA's violent felony residual provision only if it poses at least as much risk of physical injury to another as the least risky of the enumerated crimes; and in Part II-B that the least risky of the enumerated crimes is burglary; I am finally able to turn to the ultimate question posed by this case: Does <i>attempted</i> burglary categorically qualify as a violent felony under ACCA's residual provision? Or as my analysis has recast that question, does attempted burglary categorically involve conduct that poses at least as much risk of physical injury to another as completed burglary? Contrary to what the Court says, <i>ante,</i> at 1594-1597, the answer must be no.</p>\n<p>In <i>Taylor,</i> we discussed the risks posed by the conduct involved in a completed burglary. We found it significant that a burglary involves \"invasion of victims' homes or workplaces,\" 495 U.S., at 581, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted), and we dwelled on such an invasion's \"inherent potential for harm to persons,\" <i>id.,</i> at 588, 110 S.Ct. 2143. In comparing attempted burglary to completed burglary, the Court focuses almost exclusively on \"the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1594. But it ignores numerous other factors that make a completed burglary far more dangerous than a failed one: the closer proximity between burglar and victim where a confrontation takes place inside the confined space of the victim's home; the greater likelihood of the victim's initiating violence inside his home to protect his family and property; the greater likelihood that any confrontation inside the home will be between the burglar and the <i>occupant</i> of the home, rather than the <i>police.</i> The so-called \"confrontation\" the Court envisions between a would-be burglar and a third party while the burglar is still <i>outside</i> the home is likely to consist of nothing more than the occupant's yelling \"Who's there?\" from his window, and the burglar's running away. It is simply not the case, as the Court apparently believes, that would-be home entries are often reduced to <i>attempted</i> home entries by <i>physical confrontation</i> between homeowner and criminal while the latter is still outside the house. (One must envision a householder throwing open his front door, shotgun in hand, just as the would-be burglar is trying to pick the lock.)</p>\n<p>As we have previously stated, it is \"[t]he fact that an offender <i>enters</i> a building to commit a crime [that] creates the possibility of a violent confrontation between the offender and an occupant, caretaker, or some other person who comes to investigate.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 588, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (emphasis added); see also <i>Leocal, supra,</i> at 10, 125 S.Ct. 377 (\"[B]urglary, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim <i>in completing the crime</i>\" (emphasis added)). By definition, a perpetrator who has been convicted only of attempted burglary has failed to make it inside the home or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1608</span> workplace. (Indeed, a criminal convicted only of attempted burglary almost certainly injured no one; otherwise, he would have been convicted of something far more serious, such as assault or murder.) Thus, the full extent of the risk that burglary poses \u0097 the entry into the home that makes burglary such a threat to the physical safety of its victim \u0097 is necessarily absent in attempted burglary, however \"attempt\" is defined.</p>\n<p>Because attempted burglary categorically poses a less \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" than burglary, the least risky of ACCA's enumerated crimes, I would hold that it cannot be a predicate \"violent felony\" for purposes of ACCA's mandatory minimum sentencing enhancement, \u00a7 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), regardless of how close a State's attempt statute requires the perpetrator come to completing the underlying offense.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>The Court observes, with undoubted accuracy, that my approach is not perfect. It leaves it to courts to decide, \"[w]ithout hard statistics\" to guide them, <i>ante,</i> at 1598, the degree of risk of physical injury posed by various crimes. But this is an imponderable that cannot be avoided when dealing with a statute that turns upon \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" It inheres in the Court's puny solution as well (how does the Court know that attempted burglary poses the same risk as burglary?). What this dissent must establish is not that my solution is perfect, but that it is substantially better than what the Court proposes. And there is little doubt of that. For <i>in addition</i> to leaving up in the air for judicial determination how much risk of physical injury each crime presents, the Court's uninformative opinion leaves open, to be guessed at by lower courts and by those subjected to this law: (1) whether the degree of risk covered by the residual provision is limited by the degrees of risk presented by the enumerated crimes;<sup>[6]</sup> (2) if so, whether extortion is to be given its broadest meaning, which would embrace crimes with virtually no risk of physical injury; and most importantly (3) where in the world to set the <i>minimum</i> risk of physical injury that will qualify. This indeed leaves the lower courts and those subject to this law to sail upon a virtual sea of doubt. The <i>only</i> thing the Court decides (and that, in my view, erroneously) is that attempted burglary poses the same risk of physical injury as burglary, and hence is covered without the need to address these other bothersome questions (how wonderfully convenient!).</p>\n<p>It is only the Court's decision-averse solution that enables it to accuse me of \"unnecessarily decid[ing]\" the meaning of extortion, <i>ante,</i> at 1598. The Court accurately, but quite irrelevantly, asserts the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1609</span> \"[E]ven if an unenumerated offense could not qualify without presenting at least as much risk as the least risky of the enumerated offenses, it would not be necessary to identify the least risky of those offenses in order to decide this case. Rather, it would be sufficient to establish simply that the unenumerated offense presented at least as much risk as <i>one</i> of the enumerated offenses.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1598 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>That is true enough, and I would be properly criticized for reaching an unnecessary question if, like the Court, I found attempted burglary to be as risky as burglary. Since I do not, however, it is unavoidable that I determine the meaning of extortion, in order to decide whether attempted burglary is less risky than <i>that.</i> The Court's criticism amounts to nothing more than a procedural quibble: Instead of deciding, as I have, (1) that attempted burglary is clearly less risky than arson or use of explosives, (2) that of the remaining two enumerated crimes burglary is the less risky, and then (3) that attempted burglary is less risky than burglary, I should have followed step (1) with step (3), and only then have proceeded to determine the meaning of extortion. Perhaps so, but it is surely a distinction without a real-world difference. Under either approach, determining the meaning of extortion is unquestionably <i>necessary.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Congress passed ACCA to enhance punishment for gun-wielding offenders who have, <i>inter alia,</i> previously committed crimes that pose a \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" Congress provided examples of crimes that meet this eminently reasonable but entirely abstract condition. Unfortunately, however, the four examples have little in common, most especially with respect to the level of risk of physical injury they pose. Such shoddy draftsmanship puts courts to a difficult choice: They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, see n. 4, <i>supra;</i> (2) apply it case-by-case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness, see <i>Kolender,</i> 461 U.S., at 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855; <i>Lanzetta v. New Jersey,</i> 306 U.S. 451, 453, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939).</p>\n<p>I would choose either the third option (which I have tried to implement) or the fourth, since I believe the first two to be impermissible. If Congress wanted the first \u0097 subjecting <i>all</i> repeat offenders to a 15-year mandatory minimum prison term \u0097 it could very easily have crafted a statute which said that. ACCA, with its tedious definition of \"violent felony,\" was obviously not meant to have such an effect. The second option (the one chosen by the Court today) \u0097 essentially leaving it to the courts to apply the vague language in a manner that is <i>ex ante</i> (if not at the end of the day) highly unpredictable \u0097 violates, in my view, the constitutional prohibition against vague criminal laws.<sup>[7]</sup> Congress has simply abdicated its responsibility when it passes a criminal statute insusceptible of an interpretation that enables principled, predictable application; and this Court has abdicated its responsibility when <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1610</span> it allows that. Today's opinion permits an unintelligible criminal statute to survive uncorrected, unguided, and unexplained. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>For the reasons set forth in my opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 27, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), I believe that \"[t]he constitutional infirmity of \u00a7 924(e)(1) as applied to [James] makes today's decision an unnecessary exercise.\" <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny prohibit judges from \"mak[ing] a finding that raises [a defendant's] sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.\" <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 317-318, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting in part). Yet that is precisely what the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), permits in this case.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Alphonso James pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000 ed.), which exposed him to a maximum sentence of 10 years under \u00a7 924(a)(2). Section 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), however, mandated a minimum 15-year sentence if James had three prior convictions for \"a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\" James admitted he had been convicted of three prior felonies, but he argued that one of those felonies \u0097 his conviction for attempted burglary of a dwelling, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 810.02 and 777.04 (2006) \u0097 was not a \"violent felony\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The District Court resolved this disputed fact in favor of the Government and increased James' sentence accordingly. Relying on the scheme we initially created in <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p>Section 924(e)(1), in conjunction with <i>Taylor, Shepard,</i> and now today's decision, \"explain[s] to lower courts how to conduct factfinding that is, according to the logic of this Court's intervening precedents, unconstitutional in this very case.\" <i>Shepard, supra,</i> at 27, 125 S.Ct. 1254. For that reason, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  James' two other prior convictions\u0097for possession of cocaine and trafficking in cocaine\u0097were determined to be \"serious drug offense[s]\" under ACCA, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), and are not at issue here.</p>\n<p>[2]  The <i>Jones</i> court distinguished its earlier holding in <i>Thomas v. State,</i> 531 So.2d 708 (1988). There, the State Supreme Court upheld a conviction under a state statute criminalizing the possession of burglary tools, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.06, where the defendant had been arrested after jumping a fence and trying to run away from police while carrying a screwdriver. <i>Jones</i> held that \"the overt act necessary to convict of the burglary tool crime is not the same as the overt act required to prove attempted burglary,\" and noted that the conduct charged in <i>Thomas</i> would not be sufficient to prove attempted burglary because the defendant in that case committed no overt act directed toward entering or remaining in a building. 608 So.2d, at 799.</p>\n<p>[3]  See <i>United States v. Lane,</i> 909 F.2d 895, 903 (C.A.6 1990) (construing Ohio attempted burglary law: \"`The fact that an offender enters a building to commit a crime often creates the possibility of a violent confrontation between the offender and an occupant, caretaker, or some other person who comes to investigate.'...

Wisconsin's requirement that a defendant must attempt to enter a building before he can be found guilty of attempted burglary is sufficient to mandate that attempted burglary in Wisconsin constitute a violent felony\").</p>\n<p>[4]  In <i>United States v. Strahl,</i> 958 F.2d 980, 986 (1992), the Tenth Circuit held that attempted burglary under Utah law did not qualify as an ACCA predicate offense because a conviction could be \"based upon conduct such as making a duplicate key, `casing' the targeted building, obtaining floor plans of a structure, or possessing burglary tools.\" <i>United States v. Permenter,</i> 969 F.2d 911, 913 (C.A.10 1992), similarly excluded a conviction under an Oklahoma statute that could be satisfied by the defendant's \"merely `casing' the targeted structure.\" In <i>United States v. Martinez,</i> 954 F.2d 1050, 1054 (1992), the Fifth Circuit came to the same conclusion as to a Texas attempted burglary statute that did not require that the defendant be \"in the vicinity of any building.\" And in <i>United States v. Weekley,</i> 24 F.3d 1125, 1127 (C.A.9 1994), the Court of Appeals concluded that ACCA was not satisfied by a conviction under a Washington law that covered \"relatively unrisky\" conduct such as casing the neighborhood, selecting a house to burgle, and possessing neckties to be used in the burglary.</p>\n<p>[5]  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Black's Law Dictionary 1188 (7th ed.1999) (potential: \"[c]apable of coming into being; possible\"); <i>id.,</i> at 1328 (risk: \"[t]he chance of injury, damage or loss; danger or hazard\"); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1775 (1971) (potential: \"existing in possibility: having the capacity or a strong possibility for development into a state of actuality\"); <i>id.,</i> at 1961 (risk: \"the possibility of loss, injury, disadvantage, or destruction\").</p>\n<p>[6]  While ACCA requires judges to make sometimes difficult evaluations of the risks posed by different offenses, we are not persuaded by Justice SCALIA's suggestion \u0097 which was not pressed by James or his <i>amici</i> \u0097 that the residual provision is unconstitutionally vague. See <i>post,</i> at 1609. The statutory requirement that an unenumerated crime \"otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" is not so indefinite as to prevent an ordinary person from understanding what conduct it prohibits. See <i>Kolender v. Lawson,</i> 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983). Similar formulations have been used in other federal and state criminal statutes. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(a)(1)(B) (defining \"terrorist act\" as conduct that, among other things, \"creates a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to any other person\"); Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13-2508(A)(2) (West 2001) (offense of resisting arrest requires preventing an officer from effectuating an arrest by \"any ... means creating a substantial risk of causing physical injury to the peace officer or another\"); Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 42400.3(b) (West 2006) (criminalizing air pollution that \"results in any unreasonable risk of great bodily injury to, or death of, any person\"); N.Y. Penal Law Ann. \u00a7 490.47 (West Supp. 2007) (\"[c]riminal use of a chemical weapon or biological weapon\" requires \"a grave risk of death or serious physical injury to another person not a participant in the crime\").</p>\n<p>[7]  Burglary under Florida law differs from \"generic\" burglary in a second respect: It extends not just to entries of structures, but also of \"conveyance[s].\" Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(1). But because James (in accordance with what appears to be the general practice in Florida) was specifically charged with and convicted of \"attempted burglary <i>of a dwelling,</i>\" we need not examine this point further.</p>\n<p>[8]  To the extent that James contends that the simple fact of his prior conviction was required to be found by a jury, his position is baseless. James admitted the fact of his prior conviction in his guilty plea, and in any case, we have held that prior convictions need not be treated as an element of the offense for Sixth Amendment purposes. <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p>[1]  The Court imprecisely identifies the common characteristic of the enumerated offenses, and therefore the defining characteristic of the residual provision, as crimes that \"create significant risks of bodily injury or <i>confrontation</i> that might result in bodily injury.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1592 (emphasis added). Of course, adding the word \"confrontation\" is a convenient way of shoehorning attempted burglary into the ambit of the residual provision, but it is an invention entirely divorced from the statutory text.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Hobbs Act contains its own definition of extortion: \"the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2). In <i>Nardello</i> and <i>Scheidler</i> \u0097 where we were required to define generic extortion for purposes of the Travel Act and RICO, both of which leave the term undefined \u0097 we defined it as \"obtaining something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use of force, fear, or threats.\" <i>Scheidler,</i> 537 U.S., at 409, 123 S.Ct. 1057 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Nardello,</i> 393 U.S., at 290, 296, 89 S.Ct. 534 (agreeing with the Government that extortion means \"obtaining something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use of force, fear, or threats\").</p>\n<p>[3]  Two Courts of Appeals have also demonstrated the conundrum posed by Congress's inclusion of extortion in ACCA's list of enumerated violent felonies. See <i>United States v. DeLuca,</i> 17 F.3d 6, 8 (C.A.1 1994) (\"The linchpin of [appellant's] theory is the suggestion that all extortions are not equal. ... [W]e give appellant high marks for ingenuity\"); <i>United States v. Anderson,</i> 989 F.2d 310, 312 (C.A.9 1993) (Kozinski, J.) (\"Determin[ing] whether a crime [is a violent felony]... is not, with regard to `extortion,' an easy matter. In <i>Taylor,</i> the Court focused on the interstate consensus on the definition of `burglary,'... but there's no such consensus on extortion. ... It's impossible to know which definition the legislators who voted for [ACCA] had in mind. Quite likely most of them weren't thinking of any particular definition at all\"). These Courts ultimately decided to use different definitions of extortion. See <i>DeLuca, supra,</i> at 9 (deciding on the Model Penal Code approach); <i>Anderson, supra,</i> at 313 (deciding on the Hobbs Act definition).</p>\n<p>[4]  The Court explains, for example, that modern extortion could include \"an anonymous blackmailer threaten[ing] to release embarrassing personal information about the victim unless he is mailed regular payments,\" a crime involving a \"risk of physical injury to another approach[ing] zero.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1597. Thus, were the complete modern notion of extortion adopted, it is clear that extortion would be the least risky of the four enumerated crimes. That would mean that any crime posing at least as much risk of physical injury as extortion would qualify under the ACCA residual provision. But virtually any crime could qualify, so that courts would have the power to subject almost any repeat offender to ACCA's 15-year mandatory minimum. Indeed, this seems to be the reality of what is taking place in the lower courts. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 417 F.3d 990 (C.A.8 2005) (operating a dump truck without consent of the owner is a violent felony under ACCA); <i>United States v. Springfield,</i> 196 F.3d 1180 (C.A.10 1999) (\"walkaway\" escape from prison honor camp is a violent felony under ACCA).</p>\n<p>[5]  There is no need to apply the modified categorical approach in this case. Under that approach, the most the Government could achieve would be to narrow the type of Florida burglary underlying James's conviction so that it falls within generic ACCA burglary. As I discussed above, however, even the attempt to commit a generic ACCA burglary could not qualify as a violent felony under ACCA. Thus, there is no need to remand; the Eleventh Circuit should simply be reversed.</p>\n<p>[6]  The Court plays with this question, but does not resolve it, merely stating that there is a \"possibility that an offense may present `a serious risk of physical injury to another' without presenting as great a risk as any of the enumerated offenses.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1598. Of course, in light of its ultimate conclusion regarding attempted burglary, the Court could <i>not</i> resolve this question without being guilty of what it accuses me of: \"unnecessarily decid[ing] an important question,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1598; any pronouncement on this point would be pure dictum.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Court contends that the provision at issue here, even when left entirely unexplained (as today's opinion skillfully accomplishes) cannot be unconstitutionally vague, because \"[s]imilar formulations have been used in other federal and state criminal statutes.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1598-1599, n. 6. None of the provisions the Court cites, however, is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word \"otherwise,\" preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The phrase \"shades of red,\" standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase \"fire-engine red, light pink, maroon, <i>navy blue,</i> or colors that otherwise involve shades of red\" assuredly does so.</p>\n\n</div>",

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 05\u20139264. Argued November 7, 2006\u2014Decided April 18, 2007\nPleading guilty to possessing a firearm after a felony conviction in vio\n  lation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1), petitioner James admitted to the\n  three prior felony convictions listed in his federal indictment, includ\n  ing a Florida state-law conviction for attempted burglary. The Gov\n  ernment argued at sentencing that those convictions subjected James\n  to the 15-year mandatory minimum prison term provided by the\n  Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), \u00a7924(e), for an armed defendant\n  who has three prior \u201cviolent felony\u201d convictions. James objected that\n  his attempted burglary conviction was not for a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d The\n  District Court held that it was, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, is a \u201cviolent fel\n ony\u201d under ACCA. Pp. 2\u201320.\n    (a) James\u2019 argument that ACCA\u2019s text and structure categorically\n exclude attempt offenses is rejected. Pp. 2\u20137.\n      (i) Section 924(e)(2)(B) defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime pun\n ishable by imprisonment for [more than] one year . . . that . . . (i) has\n as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\n force against . . . another . . . or . . . (ii) is burglary, arson, or extor\n tion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that\n presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Flor\n ida law defined \u201cburglary\u201d when James was convicted as \u201centering or\n remaining in a structure . . . with the intent to commit an offense\n therein,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7810.02(1), and declared: \u201cA person who . . . does\n any act toward the commission of [an offense] but fails in the perpetra\n tion or . . . execution thereof, commits the offense of criminal attempt,\u201d\n \u00a7777.04(1). The attempted burglary conviction at issue was punish\n able by imprisonment exceeding one year. The parties agree that it\n does not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under clause (i) of \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)\n2                       JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    or as one of the specific crimes enumerated in clause (ii). For exam\n    ple, it is not \u201cburglary\u201d because it does not meet the definition of \u201cge\n    neric burglary\u201d found in Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 598:\n    \u201can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building\n    or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d Thus, the ques\n    tion here is whether attempted burglary, as defined by Florida, falls\n    within clause (ii)\u2019s residual provision for crimes that \u201cotherwise in\n    volv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical in\n    jury to another.\u201d Pp. 2\u20133.\n         (ii) ACCA\u2019s text does not exclude attempt offenses from the re\n    sidual provision\u2019s scope. James\u2019 claim that clause (i)s\u2019 express inclu\n    sion of attempts, combined with clause (ii)\u2019s failure to mention them,\n    demonstrates an intent to categorically exclude them from clause (ii)\n    would unduly narrow the residual provision, which does not suggest\n    any intent to exclude attempts that otherwise meet the statutory crite\n    ria. See, e.g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U. S. 73, 80.\n    James also argues to no avail that, under the ejusdem generis canon,\n    the residual provision must be read to extend only to completed of\n    fenses because the specifically enumerated offenses\u2014burglary, arson,\n    extortion, and explosives crimes\u2014all have that common attribute.\n    Rather, the most relevant common attribute of the enumerated of\n    fenses is that, while not technically crimes against the person, they\n    nevertheless create significant risks of bodily injury to others, or of\n    violent confrontation that could lead to such injury. See e.g., Taylor,\n    supra, at 597. The inclusion of the residual provision indicates Con\n    gress\u2019 intent that the preceding enumerated offenses not be an ex\n    haustive list. Pp. 3\u20136.\n         (iii) Nor does the legislative history exclude attempt offenses\n    from ACCA\u2019s residual provision. Whatever weight might ordinarily\n    be given the House\u2019s 1984 rejection of language that would have in\n    cluded attempted robbery and attempted burglary as ACCA predicate\n    offenses, it is not probative here because the 1984 action was not\n    Congress\u2019 last word on the subject. Since clause (ii)\u2019s residual provi\n    sion was added to ACCA in 1988, Congress\u2019 1984 rejection of the lan\n    guage including attempt offenses is not dispositive. Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) Attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, \u201cinvolves con\n    duct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\n    other\u201d under the residual provision. Under the \u201ccategorical ap\n    proach\u201d it has used for other ACCA offenses, the Court considers\n    whether the offense\u2019s elements are of the type that would justify its\n    inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the\n    particular offender\u2019s specific conduct. See, e.g., Taylor, supra, at 602.\n    Pp. 7\u201318.\n         (i) On its face, Florida\u2019s attempt statute requires only that a de\n                   Cite as: 550 U.

But be\ncause the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s Jones decision considerably nar\nrowed the application of this broad language in the context of at\ntempted burglary, requiring an overt act directed toward entering or\nremaining in a structure, merely preparatory activity posing no real\ndanger of harm to others, e.g., acquiring burglars\u2019 tools or casing a\nstructure, is not enough. Pp. 8\u20139.\n      (ii) Overt conduct directed toward unlawfully entering or remain\ning in a dwelling, with the intent to commit a felony therein, \u201cpre\nsents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d under the\nresidual provision of clause (ii). The clause\u2019s enumerated offenses\nprovide one baseline from which to measure whether similar conduct\nsatisfies the quoted language. Here, the risk posed by attempted\nburglary is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the\nenumerated offenses, completed burglary. See Taylor, supra, at 600,\nn. 9. The main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act\nof wrongfully entering another\u2019s property, but from the possibility that\nan innocent person might confront the burglar during the crime. At\ntempted burglary poses the same kind of risk. Indeed, that risk may\nbe even greater than the risk posed by a typical completed burglary.\nMany completed burglaries do not involve confrontations, but at\ntempted burglaries often do. Every Court of Appeals that has con\nstrued an attempted burglary law similar to Florida\u2019s has held that\nattempted burglary qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Support is also\nfound in the U. S. Sentencing Commission\u2019s determination that a\npredicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the Sentencing Guide\nlines\u2019 career offender enhancement \u201cinclude[s] . . . attempting to\ncommit [an] offens[e].\u201d See Guidelines Manual \u00a74B1.2, comment.,\nn. 1. Pp. 9\u201313.\n      (iii) Neither ACCA nor Taylor supports James\u2019 argument that,\nunder the categorical approach, attempted burglary cannot be\ntreated as an ACCA predicate offense unless all cases present a risk\nof physical injury to others. ACCA does not require such certainty,\nand James\u2019 argument misapprehends Taylor, under which the proper\ninquiry is not whether every factual offense conceivably covered by a\nstatute necessarily presents a serious potential risk of injury, but\nwhether the conduct encompassed by the offense\u2019s elements, in the\nordinary case, presents such a risk. Pp. 13\u201315.\n   (c) James\u2019 argument that the scope of Florida\u2019s underlying burglary\nstatute itself precludes treating attempted burglary as an ACCA\npredicate offense is not persuasive. Although the state-law definition\nof \u201c[d]welling\u201d to include the \u201ccurtilage thereof,\u201d Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7810.011(2), takes Florida\u2019s underlying burglary offense outside Tay\nlor\u2019s \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d definition, 495 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    sitive because the Government does not argue that James\u2019 conviction\n    constitutes \u201cburglary\u201d under ACCA. Rather, it relies on the residual\n    provision, which\u2014as Taylor recognized\u2014can cover conduct outside\n    the strict definition of, but nevertheless similar to, generic burglary.\n    Id., at 600, n. 9. The Florida Supreme Court\u2019s Hamilton decision\n    construed curtilage narrowly, requiring some form of enclosure for\n    the area surrounding a residence. A burglar illegally attempting to\n    enter the curtilage around a dwelling creates much the same risk of\n    confrontation as one attempting to enter the structure itself. Pp. 18\u2013\n    20.\n       (d) Because the Court is here engaging in statutory interpretation,\n    not judicial factfinding, James\u2019 argument that construing attempted\n    burglary as a violent felony raises Sixth Amendment issues under\n    Apprendi v.

S. C.\n\u00a7924(e), provides that a defendant convicted of possession\nof a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of \u00a7922(g), is\nsubject to a mandatory sentence of 15 years of imprison\nment if the defendant has three prior convictions \u201cfor a\nviolent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d\n   The question before us is whether attempted burglary, as\ndefined by Florida law, is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA.\nWe hold that it is, and we therefore affirm the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals.\n                               I\n  Petitioner Alphonso James pleaded guilty in federal\ncourt to one count of possessing a firearm after being\nconvicted of a felony, in violation of \u00a7922(g)(1). In his\nguilty plea, James admitted to the three prior felony con\nvictions listed in his federal indictment. These included a\nconviction in Florida state court for attempted burglary of\na dwelling, in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7\u00a7810.02 and\n777.04.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 James\u2019   two other prior convictions\u2014for possession of cocaine and\n2                   JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   At sentencing, the Government argued that James was\nsubject to ACCA\u2019s 15-year mandatory minimum term\nbecause of his three prior convictions. James objected,\narguing that his attempted burglary conviction did not\nqualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e). The\nDistrict Court held that attempted burglary is a violent\nfelony, and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\naffirmed that holding, 430 F. 3d 1150, 1157 (2005). We\ngranted certiorari, 547 U. S. ___ (2006).\n                                II \n\n                                A\n\n   ACCA\u2019s 15-year mandatory minimum applies \u201c[i]n the\ncase of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title\n[the felon in possession of a firearm provision] and has\nthree prior convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious\ndrug offense, or both, committed on occasions different\nfrom one another.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(1). ACCA defines a \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d as\n     \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term ex\n     ceeding one year . . . that\u2014\n       \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n     threatened use of physical force against the person of\n     another; or\n       \u201c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\n     explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre\n     sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\n     other.\u201d \u00a7924(2)(B).\n  Florida defined the crime of burglary at the time of\nJames\u2019 conviction as follows: \u201c \u2018Burglary\u2019 means entering or\nremaining in a structure or a conveyance with the intent to\ncommit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the\ntime open to the public or the defendant is licensed or\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntrafficking in cocaine\u2014were determined to be \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d\nunder ACCA, see 18 U.

Stat. \u00a7810.02(1) (1993).\nFlorida\u2019s criminal attempt statute provided: \u201cA person who\nattempts to commit an offense prohibited by law and in\nsuch attempt does any act toward the commission of such\noffense, but fails in the perpetration or is intercepted or\nprevented in the execution thereof, commits the offense of\ncriminal attempt.\u201d \u00a7777.04(1). The attempted burglary\nconviction at issue here was punishable by imprisonment\nfor a term exceeding one year.\n   The parties agree that attempted burglary does not\nqualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under clause (i) of ACCA\u2019s\ndefinition because it does not have \u201cas an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against\nthe person of another.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). Nor\ndoes it qualify as one of the specific crimes enumerated in\nclause (ii). Attempted burglary is not robbery or extortion.\nIt does not involve the use of explosives. And it is not\n\u201cburglary\u201d because it does not meet the definition of bur\nglary under ACCA that this Court set forth in Taylor v.\nUnited States, 495 U. S. 575, 598 (1990): \u201can unlawful or\nunprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or\nother structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d See Fla.\nStat. \u00a7777.04(1) (crime of attempt under Florida law re\nquires as an element that the defendant \u201cfai[l] in the\nperpetration or [be] intercepted or prevented in the execu\ntion\u201d of the underlying offense).\n   The question before the Court, then, is whether at\ntempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, falls within\nACCA\u2019s residual provision for crimes that \u201cotherwise\ninvolv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n                           B\n  Before determining whether the elements of attempted\nburglary under Florida law qualify under ACCA\u2019s residual\nprovision, we first consider James\u2019 argument that the\n4                 JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute\u2019s text and structure categorically exclude attempt\noffenses from the scope of the residual provision. We\nconclude that nothing in the plain language of clause (ii),\nwhen read together with the rest of the statute, prohibits\nattempt offenses from qualifying as ACCA predicates\nwhen they involve conduct that presents a serious poten\ntial risk of physical injury to another.\n    James first argues that the residual provision of clause\n(ii) must be read in conjunction with clause (i), which\nexpressly includes in its definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d\noffenses that have \u201cas an element the . . . attempted use\n. . . of physical force against another.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\n(emphasis added). James thus concludes that Congress\u2019\nexpress inclusion of attempt offenses in clause (i), com\nbined with its failure to mention attempts in clause (ii),\ndemonstrates an intent to categorically exclude attempt\noffenses from the latter provision.\n    We are not persuaded. James\u2019 reading would unduly\nnarrow clause (ii)\u2019s residual provision, the language of\nwhich does not suggest any intent to exclude attempt of\nfenses that otherwise meet the statutory criteria. Clause\n(i), in contrast, lacks a broad residual provision, thus mak\ning it necessary to specify exactly what types of offenses\u2014\nincluding attempt offenses\u2014are covered by its language. In\nshort, \u201cthe expansive phrasing of\u201d clause (ii) \u201cpoints directly\naway from the sort of exclusive specification\u201d that James\nwould read into it. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536\nU. S. 73, 80 (2002); see also United States v. Davis, 16 F. 3d\n212, 217 (CA7) (rejecting argument that \u201chad Congress\nwished to include attempted burglary as a \u00a7924(e) predicate\noffense, it would have done so expressly\u201d as \u201cuntenable in\nlight of the very existence of the \u2018otherwise\u2019 clause, which\nCongress plainly intended to serve as a catch-all provi\nsion\u201d), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 945 (1994).\n    James next invokes the canon of ejusdem generis\u2014that\nwhen a general phrase follows a list of specifics, it should\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbe read to include only things of the same type as those\nspecifically enumerated. He argues that the \u201ccommon\nattribute\u201d of the offenses specifically enumerated in clause\n(ii)\u2014burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the\nuse of explosives\u2014is that they are all completed offenses.\nThe residual provision, he contends, should similarly be\nread to extend only to completed offenses.\n   This argument is unavailing. As an initial matter, the\npremise on which it depends\u2014that clause (ii)\u2019s specifically\nenumerated crimes are limited to completed offenses\u2014is\nfalse. An unsuccessful attempt to blow up a government\nbuilding, for example, would qualify as a specifically enu\nmerated predicate offense because it would \u201cinvolv[e] [the]\nuse of explosives.\u201d See, e.g., \u00a7844(f)(1) (making it a crime\nto \u201cmaliciously damag[e] or destro[y], or attemp[t] to dam\nage or destroy, by means of fire or an explosive,\u201d certain\nproperty used in or affecting interstate commerce (empha\nsis added)).\n   In any event, the most relevant common attribute of the\nenumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, and\nexplosives use is not \u201ccompletion.\u201d Rather, it is that all of\nthese offenses, while not technically crimes against the\nperson, nevertheless create significant risks of bodily\ninjury or confrontation that might result in bodily injury.\nAs we noted in Taylor,\n    \u201cCongress thought that certain general categories of\n    property crimes\u2014namely burglary, arson, extortion,\n    and the use of explosives\u2014so often presented a risk of\n    injury to persons, or were so often committed by ca\n    reer criminals, that they should be included in the en\n    hancement statute even though, considered solely in\n    terms of their statutory elements, they do not neces\n    sarily involve the use or threat of force against a per\n    son.\u201d 495 U. S., at 597.\nSee also id., at 588 (noting that Congress singled out bur\n6                 JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nglary because it \u201coften creates the possibility of a violent\nconfrontation\u201d); United States v. Adams, 51 Fed. Appx. 507,\n508 (CA6 2002) (arson presents \u201ca serious risk of physical\ninjury to another\u201d because \u201c[n]ot only might the targeted\nbuilding be occupied,\u201d but also \u201cthe fire could harm fire\nfighters and onlookers and could spread to occupied struc\ntures\u201d); H. R. Rep. No. 99\u2013849, p. 3 (1986) (purpose of clause\n(ii) was to \u201cadd State and Federal crimes against property\nsuch as burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives and\nsimilar crimes as predicate offenses where the conduct\ninvolved presents a serious risk of injury to a person\u201d).\n   Congress\u2019 inclusion of a broad residual provision in\nclause (ii) indicates that it did not intend the preceding\nenumerated offenses to be an exhaustive list of the types\nof crimes that might present a serious risk of injury to\nothers and therefore merit status as a \u00a7924(e) predicate\noffense. Nothing in the statutory language supports the\nview that Congress intended to limit this category solely to\ncompleted offenses.\n                             C\n  James also relies on ACCA\u2019s legislative history to but\ntress his argument that clause (ii) categorically excludes\nattempt offenses. In the deliberations leading up to ACCA\u2019s\nadoption in 1984, the House rejected a version of the stat\nute that would have provided enhanced penalties for use of\na firearm by persons with two prior convictions for \u201cany\nrobbery or burglary offense, or a conspiracy or attempt to\ncommit such an offense.\u201d S. 52, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a72\n(1984) (emphasis added). The bill that ultimately became\nlaw omitted any reference to attempts, and simply defined\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d to include \u201crobbery or burglary, or both.\u201d\nArmed Career Criminal Act of 1984, \u00a71802, 98 Stat. 2185,\nrepealed in 1986 by Pub. L. 99\u2013308, \u00a7104(b), 100 Stat. 459.\nJames argues that Congress\u2019 rejection of this explicit \u201cat\ntempt\u201d language in 1984 evidenced an intent to exclude\n                  Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nattempted burglary as a predicate offense.\n   Whatever weight this legislative history might ordinarily\nhave, we do not find it probative here, because the 1984\nenactment on which James relies was not Congress\u2019 last\nword on the subject. In 1986, Congress amended ACCA for\nthe purpose of \u201c \u2018expanding\u2019 the range of predicate offenses.\u201d\nTaylor, supra, at 584. The 1986 amendments added the\nmore expansive language that is at issue in this case\u2014\nincluding clause (ii)\u2019s language defining as violent felonies\noffenses that are \u201cburglary, arson, extortion, involv[e] use of\nexplosives, or otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Career\nCriminals Amendment Act of 1986, \u00a71402(b), 100 Stat.\n3207\u201340, codified at 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This\nlanguage is substantially broader than the 1984 provision\nthat it amended. Because both the Government and the\nCourt of Appeals relied on the broader language of the 1986\namendments\u2014specifically, the residual provision\u2014as the\ntextual basis for including attempted burglary within the\nlaw\u2019s scope, Congress\u2019 rejection of express language includ\ning attempt offenses in the 1984 provision is not dispositive.\nCongress did not consider, much less reject, any such lan\nguage when it enacted the 1986 amendments. What it did\nconsider, and ultimately adopted, was a broadly worded\nresidual clause that does not by its terms exclude attempt\noffenses, and whose reach is broad enough to encompass at\nleast some such offenses.\n                              III\n   Having concluded that neither the statutory text nor the\nlegislative history discloses any congressional intent to\ncategorically exclude attempt offenses from the scope of\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s residual provision, we next ask whether\nattempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, is an of\nfense that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious poten\ntial risk of physical injury to another.\u201d In answering this\n8                    JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nquestion, we employ the \u201c \u2018categorical approach\u2019 \u201d that this\nCourt has taken with respect to other offenses under\nACCA. Under this approach, we \u201c \u2018look only to the fact of\nconviction and the statutory definition of the prior of\nfense,\u2019 \u201d and do not generally consider the \u201cparticular facts\ndisclosed by the record of conviction.\u201d Shepard v. United\nStates, 544 U. S. 13, 17 (2005) (quoting Taylor, 495 U. S.,\nat 602). That is, we consider whether the elements of the\noffense are of the type that would justify its inclusion\nwithin the residual provision, without inquiring into the\nspecific conduct of this particular offender.\n                             A\n  We begin by examining what constitutes attempted\nburglary under Florida law. On its face, Florida\u2019s attempt\nstatute requires only that a defendant take \u201cany act to\nward the commission\u201d of burglary. Fla. Stat. \u00a7777.04(1).\nJames contends that this broad statutory language sweeps\nin merely preparatory activity that poses no real danger of\nharm to others\u2014for example, acquiring burglars\u2019 tools or\ncasing a structure while planning a burglary.\n  But while the statutory language is broad, the Florida\nSupreme Court has considerably narrowed its application\nin the context of attempted burglary, requiring an \u201covert\nact directed toward entering or remaining in a structure or\nconveyance.\u201d Jones v. State, 608 So. 2d 797, 799 (1992).\nMere preparation is not enough. See ibid.2 Florida\u2019s lower\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Jones court distinguished its earlier holding in Thomas v. State,\n\n531 So. 2d 708 (1988). There, the State Supreme Court upheld a\nconviction under a state statute criminalizing the possession of bur\nglary tools, Fla. Stat. \u00a7810.06, where the defendant had been arrested\nafter jumping a fence and trying to run away from police while carrying\na screwdriver. Jones held that \u201cthe overt act necessary to convict of the\nburglary tool crime is not the same as the overt act required to prove\nattempted burglary,\u201d and noted that the conduct charged in Thomas\nwould not be sufficient to prove attempted burglary because the defen\ndant in that case committed no overt act directed toward entering or\n                     Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)        9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts appear to have consistently applied this heightened\nstandard. See, e.g., Richardson v. State, 922 So. 2d 331,\n334 (App. 2006); Davis v. State, 741 So. 2d 1213, 1214\n(App. 1999).\n  The pivotal question, then, is whether overt conduct\ndirected toward unlawfully entering or remaining in a\ndwelling, with the intent to commit a felony therein, is\n\u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n                              B\n   In answering this question, we look to the statutory\nlanguage for guidance. The specific offenses enumerated\nin clause (ii) provide one baseline from which to measure\nwhether other similar conduct \u201cotherwise . . . presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury.\u201d In this case, we\ncan ask whether the risk posed by attempted burglary is\ncomparable to that posed by its closest analog among the\nenumerated offenses\u2014here, completed burglary.            See\nTaylor, supra, at 600, n. 9 (\u201cThe Government remains free\nto argue that any offense\u2014including offenses similar to\ngeneric burglary\u2014should count towards enhancement as\none that \u2018otherwise involves conduct that presents a seri\nous potential risk of physical injury to another\u2019 under\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u201d).\n    The main risk of burglary arises not from the simple\nphysical act of wrongfully entering onto another\u2019s property,\nbut rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confronta\ntion between the burglar and a third party\u2014whether an\noccupant, a police officer, or a bystander\u2014who comes to\ninvestigate. That is, the risk arises not from the completion\nof the burglary, but from the possibility that an innocent\nperson might appear while the crime is in progress.\n   Attempted burglary poses the same kind of risk. Inter\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nremaining in a building. 608 So. 2d, at 799.\n\n10                 JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrupting an intruder at the doorstep while the would-be\nburglar is attempting a break-in creates a risk of violent\nconfrontation comparable to that posed by finding him\ninside the structure itself. As one court has explained:\n     \u201cIn all of these cases the risk of injury arises, not from\n     the completion of the break-in, but rather from the\n     possibility that some innocent party may appear on\n     the scene while the break-in is occurring. This is just\n     as likely to happen before the defendant succeeds in\n     breaking in as after. Indeed, the possibility may be at\n     its peak while the defendant is still outside trying to\n     break in, as that is when he is likely to be making\n     noise and exposed to the public view. . . . [T]here is a\n     serious risk of confrontation while a perpetrator is at\n     tempting to enter the building.\u201d United States v.\n     Payne, 966 F. 2d 4, 8 (CA1 1992).\n   Indeed, the risk posed by an attempted burglary that\ncan serve as the basis for an ACCA enhancement may be\neven greater than that posed by a typical completed bur\nglary. All burglaries begin as attempted burglaries. But\nACCA only concerns that subset of attempted burglaries\nwhere the offender has been apprehended, prosecuted, and\nconvicted. This will typically occur when the attempt is\nthwarted by some outside intervenor\u2014be it a property\nowner or law enforcement officer. Many completed bur\nglaries do not involve such confrontations. But attempted\nburglaries often do; indeed, it is often just such outside\nintervention that prevents the attempt from ripening into\ncompletion.\n   Concluding that attempted burglary presents a risk that\nis comparable to the risk posed by the completed offense,\nevery Court of Appeals that has construed an attempted\nburglary law similar in scope to Florida\u2019s has held that the\noffense qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under clause (ii)\u2019s\n                      Cite as: 550 U.

Brief for Petitioner 32. Citing\nthe categorical approach we employed in Taylor, he argues\nthat we cannot treat attempted burglary as an ACCA\npredicate offense unless all cases present such a risk.\nJames\u2019 approach is supported by neither the statute\u2019s text\nnor this Court\u2019s holding in Taylor.\n   One could, of course, imagine a situation in which at\ntempted burglary might not pose a realistic risk of confron\ntation or injury to anyone\u2014for example, a break-in of an\nunoccupied structure located far off the beaten path and\naway from any potential intervenors. But ACCA does not\nrequire metaphysical certainty. Rather, \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s\nresidual provision speaks in terms of a \u201cpotential risk.\u201d\nThese are inherently probabilistic concepts.5 Indeed, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 5 See,   e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1188 (7th ed. 1999) (potential:\n14                    JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncombination of the two terms suggests that Congress in\ntended to encompass possibilities even more contingent or\nremote than a simple \u201crisk,\u201d much less a certainty. While\nthere may be some attempted burglaries that do not pre\nsent a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\nthe same is true of completed burglaries\u2014which are explic\nitly covered by the statutory language and provide a base\nline against which to measure the degree of risk that a non-\nenumerated offense must \u201cotherwise\u201d present in order to\nqualify.\n   James\u2019 argument also misapprehends Taylor\u2019s categori\ncal approach. We do not view that approach as requiring\nthat every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute\nmust necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury\nbefore the offense can be deemed a violent felony. Cf.\nGonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip\nop., at 9) (\u201c[T]o find that a state statute creates a crime\noutside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal\nstatute requires more than the application of legal imagi\nnation to a state statute\u2019s language. It requires a realistic\nprobability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State\nwould apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the\ngeneric definition of a crime\u201d).\n   Rather, the proper inquiry is whether the conduct en\ncompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary\ncase, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\nOne can always hypothesize unusual cases in which even\na prototypically violent crime might not present a genuine\nrisk of injury\u2014for example, an attempted murder where\nthe gun, unbeknownst to the shooter, had no bullets, see\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201c[c]apable of coming into being; possible\u201d); id., at 1328 (risk: \u201c[t]he\nchance of injury, damage or loss; danger or hazard\u201d); Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1775 (1971) (potential: \u201cexisting in\npossibility: having the capacity or a strong possibility for development\ninto a state of actuality\u201d); id., at 1961 (risk: \u201cthe possibility of loss,\ninjury, disadvantage, or destruction\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

Thomas, 361 F. 3d 653, 659 (CADC 2004).\nOr, to take an example from the offenses specifically enu\nmerated in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), one could imagine an extor\ntion scheme where an anonymous blackmailer threatens\nto release embarrassing personal information about the\nvictim unless he is mailed regular payments. In both\ncases, the risk of physical injury to another approaches\nzero. But that does not mean that the offenses of at\ntempted murder or extortion are categorically nonviolent.\n   As long as an offense is of a type that, by its nature,\npresents a serious potential risk of injury to another, it\nsatisfies the requirements of \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s residual\nprovision. Attempted burglary under Florida law\u2014as\nconstrued in Jones to require an overt act directed toward\nentry of a structure\u2014satisfies this test.\n                             D\n   JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s dissent criticizes our approach on the\nground that it does not provide sufficient guidance for\nlower courts required to decide whether unenumerated\noffenses other than attempted burglary qualify as violent\nfelonies under ACCA. But the dissent\u2019s alternative ap\nproach has more serious disadvantages. Among other\nthings, that approach unnecessarily decides an important\nquestion that the parties have not briefed (the meaning of\nthe term \u201cextortion\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)), decides that\nquestion in a way that is hardly free from doubt, and fails\nto provide an interpretation of the residual provision that\nfurnishes clear guidance for future cases.\n   The dissent interprets the residual provision to require\nat least as much risk as the least dangerous enumerated\noffense. But the ordinary meaning of the language of the\nresidual clause does not impose such a requirement. What\nthe clause demands is \u201ca serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another.\u201d While it may be reasonable to infer\nthat the risks presented by the enumerated offenses in\n16                   JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nvolve a risk of this magnitude, it does not follow that an\noffense that presents a lesser risk necessarily fails to\nqualify. Nothing in the language of \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) rules\nout the possibility that an offense may present \u201ca serious\nrisk of physical injury to another\u201d without presenting as\ngreat a risk as any of the enumerated offenses.\n   Moreover, even if an unenumerated offense could not\nqualify without presenting at least as much risk as the\nleast risky of the enumerated offenses, it would not be\nnecessary to identify the least risky of those offenses in\norder to decide this case. Rather, it would be sufficient to\nestablish simply that the unenumerated offense presented\nat least as much risk as one of the enumerated offenses.\nThus, JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of\nthe term \u201cextortion\u201d is unnecessary\u2014and inadvisable.\nThe parties have not briefed this issue, and the proposed\ninterpretation is hardly beyond question. Instead of in\nterpreting the meaning of the term \u201cextortion\u201d in accor\ndance with its meaning at common law or in modern\nfederal and state statutes, see Taylor, 495 U. S., at 598, it\nis suggested that we adopt an interpretation that seems to\nbe entirely novel and that greatly reduces the reach of\nACCA.\n   The stated reason for tackling this question is to provide\nguidance for the lower courts in future cases\u2014surely a\nworthy objective. But in practical terms, the proposed\ninterpretation of the residual clause would not make it\nmuch easier for the lower courts to decide whether other\nunenumerated offenses qualify. Without hard statistics\u2014\nand no such statistics have been called to our attention\u2014\nhow is a lower court to determine whether the risk posed\nby generic burglary is greater or less than the risk posed\nby an entirely unrelated unenumerated offense\u2014say,\nescape from prison? 6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 6 While   ACCA requires judges to make sometimes difficult evalua\n                     Cite as: 550 U.

The risk\nof physical injury in both cases occurs when there is a\nconfrontation between the criminal and another person,\nwhether an occupant of the structure, a law enforcement\nofficer or security guard, or someone else. It is argued\nthat when such an encounter occurs during a consum\nmated burglary (i.e., after entry), the risk is greater than\nit is when the encounter occurs during an attempted\nburglary (i.e., before entry is effected), and that may be\ntrue. But this argument fails to come to grips with the\nfact that such encounters may occur much more frequently\nduring attempted burglaries because it is precisely due to\nsuch encounters that many planned burglaries do not\nprogress beyond the attempt stage. JUSTICE SCALIA dis\nmisses the danger involved when an encounter occur\nduring attempted burglaries, stating that such encounters\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntions of the risks posed by different offenses, we are not persuaded by\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s suggestion\u2014which was not pressed by James or his\namici\u2014that the residual provision is unconstitutionally vague. See\npost, at 17. The statutory requirement that an unenumerated crime\n\u201cotherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another\u201d is not so indefinite as to prevent an ordinary\nperson from understanding what conduct it prohibits. See Kolender v.\nLawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357 (1983). Similar formulations have been\nused in other federal and state criminal statutes. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a72332b(a)(1)(B) (defining \u201cterrorist act\u201d as conduct that, among other\nthings, \u201ccreates a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to any other\nperson\u201d); Ariz. Rev.

But there are many other\npossible scenarios. An armed would-be burglar may be\nspotted by a police officer, a private security guard, or a\nparticipant in a neighborhood watch program. Or a home\nowner angered by the sort of conduct recited in James\u2019\npresentence report\u2014throwing a hammer through a win\ndow\u2014may give chase, and a violent encounter may ensue.\nFor these reasons and the reasons discussed above, we are\nconvinced that the offense of attempted burglary, as de\nfined by Florida law, qualifies under ACCA\u2019s residual\nclause.\n                              IV\n  Although the question on which this Court granted\ncertiorari focused on the attempt prong of Florida\u2019s at\ntempted burglary law, James also argues that the scope of\nthe State\u2019s underlying burglary statute itself precludes\ntreating attempted burglary as a violent felony for ACCA\npurposes. Specifically, he argues that Florida\u2019s burglary\nstatute differs from \u201cgeneric\u201d burglary as defined in Tay\nlor, supra, at 598, because it defines a \u201c \u2018[d]welling\u2019 \u201d to\ninclude not only the structure itself, but also the \u201ccurtilage\nthereof,\u201d7 Fla. Stat. \u00a7810.011(2) (1993).\n  We agree that the inclusion of curtilage takes Florida\u2019s\nunderlying offense of burglary outside the definition of\n\u201cgeneric burglary\u201d set forth in Taylor, which requires an\nunlawful entry into, or remaining in, \u201ca building or other\nstructure.\u201d 495 U. S., at 598 (emphasis added). But that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Burglary under Florida law differs from \u201cgeneric\u201d burglary in a sec\n\nond respect: It extends not just to entries of structures, but also of\n\u201cconveyance[s].\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7810.02(1). But because James (in accor\ndance with what appears to be the general practice in Florida) was\nspecifically charged with and convicted of \u201cattempted burglary of a\ndwelling,\u201d we need not examine this point further.\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconclusion is not dispositive, because the Government does\nnot argue that James\u2019 conviction for attempted burglary\nconstitutes \u201cburglary\u201d under \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Rather, it\nrelies on the residual provision of that clause, which\u2014as\nthe Court has recognized\u2014can cover conduct that is out\nside the strict definition of, but nevertheless similar to,\ngeneric burglary. Id., at 600, n. 9.\n   Is the risk posed by an attempted entry of the curtilage\ncomparable to that posed by the attempted entry of a\nstructure (which, as we concluded above, is sufficient to\nqualify under the residual provision)? We must again\nturn to state law in order to answer this question.\n   The Florida Supreme Court has construed curtilage\nnarrowly, requiring \u201csome form of an enclosure in order\nfor the area surrounding a residence to be considered part\nof the \u2018curtilage\u2019 as referred to in the burglary statute.\u201d\nState v. Hamilton, 660 So. 2d 1038, 1044 (1995) (holding\nthat a yard surrounded by trees was not \u201ccurtilage\u201d); see\nalso United States v. Matthews, 466 F. 3d 1271, 1274\n(CA11 2006) (\u201cFlorida case law construes curtilage nar\nrowly, to include only an enclosed area surrounding a\nstructure\u201d). Given this narrow definition, we do not be\nlieve that the inclusion of curtilage so mitigates the risk\npresented by attempted burglary as to take the offense\noutside the scope of clause (ii)\u2019s residual provision.\n   A typical reason for enclosing the curtilage adjacent to a\nstructure is to keep out unwanted visitors\u2014especially\nthose with criminal motives. And a burglar who illegally\nattempts to enter the enclosed area surrounding a dwell\ning creates much the same risk of physical confrontation\nwith a property owner, law enforcement official, or other\nthird party as does one who attempts to enter the struc\nture itself. In light of Florida\u2019s narrow definition of curti\nlage, attempted burglary of the curtilage requires both\nphysical proximity to the structure and an overt act di\nrected toward breaching the enclosure. Such an attempt\n20                    JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cpresents a serious potential risk that violence will ensue\nand someone will be injured.\u201d Id., at 1275 (holding that\nburglary of the curtilage is a violent felony under ACCA\u2019s\nresidual provision).\n                              V\n   Finally, James argues that construing attempted bur\nglary as a violent felony raises Sixth Amendment issues\nunder Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and\nits progeny because it is based on \u201cjudicial fact finding\u201d\nabout the risk presented by \u201cthe acts that underlie \u2018most\u2019\nconvictions for attempted burglary.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n34, 35. This argument is without merit.\n   In determining whether attempted burglary under Flor\nida law qualifies as a violent felony under \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii),\nthe Court is engaging in statutory interpretation, not judi\ncial factfinding. Indeed, by applying Taylor\u2019s categorical\napproach, we have avoided any inquiry into the underlying\nfacts of James\u2019 particular offense, and have looked solely to\nthe elements of attempted burglary as defined by Florida\nlaw. Such analysis raises no Sixth Amendment issue.8\n                        *     *    *\n  For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 To the extent that James contends that the simple fact of his prior\n\nconviction was required to be found by a jury, his position is baseless.\nJames admitted the fact of his prior conviction in his guilty plea, and in\nany case, we have held that prior convictions need not be treated as an\nelement of the offense for Sixth Amendment purposes.

S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This was the basis for the Elev\nenth Circuit\u2019s decision. (\u201cWe . . . hold that an attempt to\ncommit burglary . . . presents the potential risk of physical\ninjury to another sufficient to satisfy the ACCA\u2019s defini\ntion of a \u2018violent felony,\u2019 \u201d 430 F. 3d 1150, 1157 (2005)), and\nit is the center of the parties\u2019 dispute before this Court.\n   The problem with the Court\u2019s approach to determining\nwhich crimes fit within the residual provision is that it is\nalmost entirely ad hoc. This crime, the Court says, does\n\u201cinvolv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another.\u201d That gets this case off our\ndocket, sure enough. But it utterly fails to do what this\nCourt is supposed to do: provide guidance concrete enough\n2                 JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nto ensure that the ACCA residual provision will be applied\nwith an acceptable degree of consistency by the hundreds\nof district judges that impose sentences every day. The\none guideline the Court does suggest is that the sentencer\nshould compare the unenumerated offense at issue with\nthe \u201cclosest analog\u201d among the four offenses that are set\nforth (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the\nuse of explosives), and should include the unenumerated\noffense within ACCA if the risk it poses is \u201ccomparable.\u201d\nAnte, at 9. The principal attraction of this test, I suspect,\nis that it makes it relatively easy to decide the present\ncase (though, as I shall subsequently discuss, I think the\nCourt reaches the wrong conclusion as to whether at\ntempted burglary poses a comparable risk). Assuming\nthat \u201ccomparable\u201d means \u201cabout the same,\u201d the Court\u2019s\ntest does provide some guidance where the most closely\nanalogous offense is clear (as here) and the risk is compa\nrable. But what if, as will very often be the case, it is not\nat all obvious which of the four enumerated offenses is the\nclosest analog\u2014or if (to tell the truth) none of them is\nanalogous at all? Is, for example, driving under the influ\nence of alcohol more analogous to burglary, arson, extor\ntion, or a crime involving use of explosives? And if an\nanalog is identified, what is to be done if the offense at\nissue does not present a comparable risk? The Court\ndeclines to say, but it seems inconceivable that it means\nthe offense to be excluded from ACCA for that reason. For\nexample, it does not comport with any conceivable con\ngressional intent to disqualify an unenumerated crime\nthat is most analogous to arson and presents nowhere\nnear the risk of injury posed by arson, but presents a far\ngreater risk of injury than burglary, which Congress has\nexplicitly included. Thus, for what is probably the vast\nmajority of cases, today\u2019s opinion provides no guidance\nwhatever, leaving the lower courts to their own devices in\ndeciding, crime-by-crime, which conviction \u201cinvolves con\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

Compare ante, at 10 (concluding\nthat attempted burglary poses sufficient risk), with Leocal\nv. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004) (concluding that driving\nunder the influence of alcohol does not pose a \u201csubstantial\nrisk that physical force against the person or property of\nanother may be used,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a716(b)).\n   Imprecision and indeterminacy are particularly inap\npropriate in the application of a criminal statute. Years of\nprison hinge on the scope of ACCA\u2019s residual provision, yet\nits boundaries are ill defined. If we are not going to deny\neffect to this statute as being impermissibly vague, see\nPart III, infra, we have the responsibility to derive from\nthe text rules of application that will provide notice of\nwhat is covered and prevent arbitrary or discriminatory\nsentencing. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357\n(1983). Offenders should be on notice that a particular\ncourse of conduct will result in a mandatory minimum\nprison term of 15 years. The Court prefers to keep them\nguessing.\n                             II\n  The residual provision of clause (ii) of ACCA\u2019s definition\nof violent felony\u2014the clause that sweeps within ACCA\u2019s\nambit any crime that \u201cotherwise involves conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother\u201d\u2014is, to put it mildly, not a model of clarity. I do\nnot pretend to have an all-encompassing solution that\nprovides for crystal-clear application of the statute in all\ncontexts. But we can do much better than today\u2019s opinion\nwith what Congress has given us.\n4                 JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n                              A\n   The Eleventh Circuit properly sought to resolve this\ncase by employing the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d of looking\nonly to the statutory elements of attempted burglary. See\n430 F. 3d, at 1154, 1156\u20131157. This \u201cgenerally prohibits\nthe later court from delving into particular facts disclosed\nby the record of conviction, thus leaving the court nor\nmally to \u2018look only to the fact of conviction and the statu\ntory definition of the prior offense.\u2019 \u201d Shepard v. United\nStates, 544 U. S. 13, 17 (2005) (quoting Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U. S. 575, 602 (1990)). As the Court does, ante,\nat 8, I would also begin with this approach.\n   The Government would have us provide some cer\ntainty\u2014at least enough to decide the present case\u2014by\nholding that the attempt to commit a crime of violence\nshould be treated the same as the completed crime. It\npoints out that various federal laws, and many state laws,\npunish attempt with the same sanction as the completed\ncrime. See Brief for United States 18\u201320. This would be\npersuasive if punishment were meted out solely on the\nbasis of the risk of physical injury that a crime presents.\nIt seems to me, however, that similar punishment does not\nnecessarily imply similar risk; it more likely represents a\njudgment that the two crimes display a similar degree of\ndepravity deserving of punishment or needful of deter\nrence. A person guilty of attempted burglary may not\nhave placed anyone at physical risk, but he was just as\nwilling to do so as the successful burglar. It seems to me\nimpossible to say that equivalence of punishment suggests\nequivalence of imposed risk. I therefore look elsewhere for\nsome clarification of the statutory text.\n   First to invite analysis is the word Congress placed at\nthe forefront of the residual provision: \u201cotherwise.\u201d When\nused as an adverb (as it is in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), modifying\nthe verb \u201cinvolves\u201d), \u201cotherwise\u201d is defined as \u201c[i]n a differ\nent manner\u201d or \u201cin another way.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Interna\n                     Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                    5\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntional Dictionary 1729 (2d ed. 1954). Thus, the most\nnatural reading of the statute is that committing one of\nthe enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, or\ncrimes involving explosives) is one way to commit a crime\n\u201cinvolv[ing] conduct that presents a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another\u201d; and that other ways of\ncommitting a crime of that character similarly constitute\n\u201cviolent felon[ies].\u201d In other words, the enumerated\ncrimes are examples of what Congress had in mind under\nthe residual provision, and the residual provision should\nbe interpreted with those examples in mind. This com\nmonsense principle of construction is sometimes referred\nto as the canon of ejusdem generis: \u201c[W]hen a general word\nor phrase follows a list of specific persons or things, the\ngeneral word or phrase will be interpreted to include only\npersons or things of the same type as those listed.\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 535 (7th ed. 1999) (Black\u2019s) see, e.g.,\nWashington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v.\nGuardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U. S. 371, 384\u2013385\n(2003). In this case, the application of that principle\nsuggests that what the residual provision means by the\ngeneral phrase \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential\nrisk of physical injury to another\u201d is conduct that resem\nbles, insofar as the degree of such risk is concerned, the\npreviously enumerated crimes.1\n   In another context, I might conclude that any degree of\nrisk that is merely similar, even if slightly less, would\nqualify. Obviously, such an interpretation would leave a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court imprecisely identifies the common characteristic of the\nenumerated offenses, and therefore the defining characteristic of the\nresidual provision, as crimes that \u201ccreate significant risks of bodily\ninjury or confrontation that might result in bodily injury.\u201d Ante, at 5\n(emphasis added). Of course, adding the word \u201cconfrontation\u201d is a\nconvenient way of shoehorning attempted burglary into the ambit of\nthe residual provision, but it is an invention entirely divorced from the\nstatutory text.\n6                 JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ngood deal of ambiguity on the downside: How low on the\nrisk scale can one go before the risk becomes too dissimilar\nfrom the enumerated crimes? Since the text sets forth no\ncriterion, courts might vary dramatically in their answer.\nCf. Leocal, 543 U. S. 1 (reversing the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\ndetermination that driving under the influence of alcohol\nqualifies as a crime of violence under 18 U. S. C. \u00a716).\nWhere it is reasonably avoidable, such indeterminateness\nis unacceptable in the context of criminal sanctions. The\nrule of lenity, grounded in part on the need to give \u201c \u2018fair\nwarning\u2019 \u201d of what is encompassed by a criminal statute,\nUnited States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971) (quoting\nMcBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931)), de\nmands that we give this text the more narrow reading of\nwhich it is susceptible. The requirement that the degree\nof risk be similar to that for the enumerated crimes means\nthat it be no lesser than the risk posed by the least dan\ngerous of those enumerated crimes.\n                               B\n    I would turn, then, to the next logical question: Which of\nthe four enumerated crimes\u2014burglary, arson, extortion, or\ncrimes involving use of explosives\u2014poses the least \u201cseri\nous potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d? The two\nthat involve use of fire or explosives cannot possibly qual\nify. Thus, the question I must address is whether bur\nglary or extortion poses a lesser risk. To do so, I must first\ndefine those crimes.\n   In Taylor, we defined \u201cburglary\u201d as used in the very\nprovision of ACCA at issue here. We first determined that\n\u201c \u2018burglary\u2019 in \u00a7924(e) must have some uniform definition\nindependent of the labels employed by the various States\u2019\ncriminal codes.\u201d 495 U. S., at 592. We considered but\nrejected the common-law definition, finding that \u201cthe\ncontemporary understanding of \u2018burglary\u2019 has diverged a\nlong way from its common-law roots.\u201d Id., at 593.

S. ____ (2007)           7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmately, we concluded that \u201cCongress meant by \u2018burglary\u2019\nthe generic sense in which the term is now used in the\ncriminal codes of most States.\u201d Id., at 598. To determine\nthat sense, we looked for guidance to W. LaFave & A.\nScott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) and the American\nLaw Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code (1980). We defined\n\u201cburglary\u201d as \u201cany crime, regardless of its exact definition\nor label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivi\nleged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure,\nwith intent to commit a crime.\u201d Taylor, supra, at 599.\n   In defining \u201cextortion\u201d for purposes of ACCA, I would\nfollow the same approach. \u201cAt common law, extortion was\na property offense committed by a public official who took\n\u2018any money or thing of value\u2019 that was not due to him\nunder the pretense that he was entitled to such property\nby virtue of his office.\u201d Scheidler v. National Organization\nfor Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 393, 402 (2003) (quoting 4 W.\nBlackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 141\n(1769), and citing 3 R. Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law\nand Procedure \u00a71393, pp. 790\u2013791 (1957)); see also 3 W.\nLaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a720.4 (2d ed. 2003).\nAs with burglary, however, modern conceptions of extor\ntion have gone well beyond the common-law understand\ning. In the Hobbs Act, for example, Congress \u201cexplicitly\n\u2018expanded the common-law definition of extortion to in\nclude acts by private individuals.\u2019 \u201d Scheidler, supra, at\n402 (quoting Evans v. United States, 504 U. S. 255, 261\n(1992)). And whereas the Hobbs Act retained the com\nmon-law requirement that something of value actually be\nacquired by the extortionist, Scheidler, supra, at 404\u2013405,\nthe majority of state statutes require only \u201cthat the defen\ndant make a threat with intent thereby to acquire the\nvictim\u2019s property,\u201d 3 LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law\n\u00a720.4(a)(1), at 199 (emphasis added). Further, under most\nstate statutes, the category of qualifying threats has ex\npanded dramatically, to include threats to: \u201ckill the victim\n8                 JAMES v.

I arrive at this\nconclusion for two reasons: First, another canon of statu\ntory construction, noscitur a sociis, which counsels that\n\u201cthe meaning of an unclear word or phrase should be\ndetermined by the words immediately surrounding it.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s 1084; see Keffeler, 537 U. S., at 384\u2013385. Of\ncourse noscitur a sociis is just an erudite (or some would\nsay antiquated) way of saying what common sense tells us\nto be true: \u201c[A] word is known by the company it keeps,\u201d\nJarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961)\u2014\nthat is to say, which of various possible meanings a word\nshould be given must be determined in a manner that\nmakes it \u201cfit\u201d with the words with which it is closely asso\nciated. The words immediately surrounding \u201cextortion\u201d in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) are \u201cburglary,\u201d \u201carson,\u201d and crimes \u201cin\nvolv[ing] use of explosives.\u201d The Model Penal Code\u2019s\nsweeping definition of extortion would sit uncomfortably\nindeed amidst this list of crimes which, as the \u201cotherwise\u201d\nresidual provision makes plain, are characterized by their\npotential for violence and their risk of physical harm to\nothers. ACCA\u2019s usage of \u201cextortion\u201d differs from the con\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Hobbs Act contains its own definition of extortion: \u201cthe obtain\n\ning of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use\nof actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official\nright.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71951(b)(2). In Nardello and Scheidler\u2014where we\nwere required to define generic extortion for purposes of the Travel Act\nand RICO, both of which leave the term undefined\u2014we defined it as\n\u201cobtaining something of value from another with his consent induced by\nthe wrongful use of force, fear, or threats.\u201d Scheidler, 537 U. S., at 409\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Nardello, 393 U. S., at 290,\n296 (agreeing with the Government that extortion means \u201cobtaining\nsomething of value from another with his consent induced by the\nwrongful use of force, fear, or threats\u201d).\n10                    JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntext in which the word appears in the Travel Act, where it\nis one of a list of crimes \u201coften used by organized crime to\ncollect . . . revenue,\u201d Nardello, supra, at 291, n. 8, includ\ning bribery. And it differs from the context in which \u201cex\ntortion\u201d appears in RICO, where it is part of a laundry list\nof nearly every federal crime under the sun. See 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).3\n   What is suggested by the canon is reinforced by the fact\nthat both the original common-law notion of extortion, and\nthe full expanse of the modern definition, include crimes\nso inherently unlikely to cause physical harm that it would\nset the bar of the residual provision at a level that could\nembrace virtually any offense\u2014making the limitation to\n\u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d ut\nterly incomprehensible.4 See Part III, infra. I therefore\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Two   Courts of Appeals have also demonstrated the conundrum\nposed by Congress\u2019s inclusion of extortion in ACCA\u2019s list of enumerated\nviolent felonies. See United States v. DeLuca, 17 F. 3d 6, 8 (CA1 1994)\n(\u201cThe linchpin of [appellant\u2019s] theory is the suggestion that all extor\ntions are not equal. . . . [W]e give appellant high marks for ingenuity\u201d);\nUnited States v. Anderson, 989 F. 2d 310, 312 (CA9 1993) (Kozinski, J.)\n(\u201cDetermin[ing] whether a crime [is a violent felony] . . . is not, with\nregard to \u2018extortion,\u2019 an easy matter. In Taylor, the Court focused on\nthe interstate consensus on the definition of \u2018burglary,\u2019 . . . but there\u2019s\nno such consensus on extortion. . . . It\u2019s impossible to know which\ndefinition the legislators who voted for [ACCA] had in mind. Quite\nlikely most of them weren\u2019t thinking of any particular definition at\nall\u201d). These Courts ultimately decided to use different definitions of\nextortion. See DeLuca, supra, at 9 (deciding on the Model Penal Code\napproach); Anderson, supra, at 313 (deciding on the Hobbs Act\ndefinition).\n   4 The Court explains, for example, that modern extortion could in\n\nclude \u201can anonymous blackmailer threaten[ing] to release embarrass\ning personal information about the victim unless he is mailed regular\npayments,\u201d a crime involving a \u201crisk of physical injury to another\napproach[ing] zero.\u201d Ante, at 15. Thus, were the complete modern\nnotion of extortion adopted, it is clear that extortion would be the least\nrisky of the four enumerated crimes. That would mean that any crime\nposing at least as much risk of physical injury as extortion would\n                     Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                   11\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nassume that extortion under ACCA is: the obtaining of\nsomething of value from another, with his consent, in\nduced by the wrongful use or threatened use of force\nagainst the person or property of another. Cf. Leocal, 543\nU. S., at 13 (discussing the relationship between the \u201cuse\nof force against the person or property of another\u201d and\n\u201ccrime[s] of violence under 18 U. S. C. \u00a716\u201d).\n   One final consideration is worthy of mention. I must\nmake sure that my restricted definition of generic extor\ntion does not render the inclusion of extortion in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) superfluous in light of \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). \u201cIt\nis our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and\nword of a statute.\u201d Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174\n(2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Clause (i)\nalready includes in ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d\nany crime that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use,\nor threatened use of physical force against the person of\nanother.\u201d My narrow definition of extortion passes the\nsurplusage test only if it includes crimes that would not be\ncovered by this provision. That is not a problem, since my\ndefinition includes the use or threatened use of force\nagainst property, whereas clause (i) is limited to force\nagainst the person. Thus, the obtaining of someone else\u2019s\nmoney by threatening to wreck his place of business would\nfit within clause (ii) but not within clause (i).\n   Having defined burglary and extortion, I return to the\nquestion that launched this investigation in the first place:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nqualify under the ACCA residual provision. But virtually any crime \n\ncould qualify, so that courts would have the power to subject almost \n\nany repeat offender to ACCA\u2019s 15-year mandatory minimum. Indeed, \n\nthis seems to be the reality of what is taking place in the lower courts. \n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 417 F. 3d 990 (CA8 2005) (operating\n\na dump truck without consent of the owner is a violent felony under\n\nACCA); United States v. Springfield, 196 F. 3d 1180 (CA10 1999) \n\n(\u201cwalkaway\u201d escape from prison honor camp is a violent felony under \n\nACCA). \n\n12               JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nWhich of the two poses the least \u201cserious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another\u201d? Recall the definitions: bur\nglary is the \u201cunlawful or unprivileged entry into, or re\nmaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit\na crime\u201d; extortion is \u201cthe obtaining of something of value\nfrom another, with his consent, induced by the wrongful\nuse or threatened use of force against the person or prop\nerty of another.\u201d Every victim of extortion is the object of\na threat, to his person or his property; if he ignores that\nthreat, or resists it by seeking to protect his property, he\nmay be harmed. Burglary, on the other hand, involves\nonly the possibility that a confrontation will take place\nwhile the crime is underway; the risk of physical harm can\nbecome a reality only if the property owner happens to be\npresent, a situation which the burglar ordinarily seeks to\navoid. The extortionist, moreover, has already expressed\nhis willingness to commit a violent act; the burglar may be\nprepared to flee at the first sign of human presence. I\nthink it obvious that burglary is less inherently risky than\nextortion, and thus the least inherently risky of the four\ncrimes enumerated in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n                              C\n  Having concluded in Part II\u2013A that a crime may qualify\nunder ACCA\u2019s violent felony residual provision only if it\nposes at least as much risk of physical injury to another as\nthe least risky of the enumerated crimes; and in Part II\u2013B\nthat the least risky of the enumerated crimes is burglary; I\nam finally able to turn to the ultimate question posed by\nthis case: Does attempted burglary categorically qualify as\na violent felony under ACCA\u2019s residual provision? Or as\nmy analysis has recast that question, does attempted\nburglary categorically involve conduct that poses at least\nas much risk of physical injury to another as completed\nburglary? Contrary to what the Court says, ante, at 9\u201313,\nthe answer must be no.\n                  Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           13\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  In Taylor, we discussed the risks posed by the conduct\ninvolved in a completed burglary. We found it significant\nthat a burglary involves \u201cinvasion of victims\u2019 homes or\nworkplaces,\u201d 495 U. S., at 581 (internal quotation marks\nand brackets omitted), and we dwelled on such an inva\nsion\u2019s \u201cinherent potential for harm to persons,\u201d id., at 588.\nIn comparing attempted burglary to completed burglary,\nthe Court focuses almost exclusively on \u201cthe possibility of\na face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a\nthird party.\u201d Ante, at 9. But it ignores numerous other\nfactors that make a completed burglary far more danger\nous than a failed one: the closer proximity between bur\nglar and victim where a confrontation takes place inside\nthe confined space of the victim\u2019s home; the greater likeli\nhood of the victim\u2019s initiating violence inside his home to\nprotect his family and property; the greater likelihood that\nany confrontation inside the home will be between the\nburglar and the occupant of the home, rather than the\npolice. The so-called \u201cconfrontation\u201d the Court envisions\nbetween a would-be burglar and a third party while the\nburglar is still outside the home is likely to consist of\nnothing more than the occupant\u2019s yelling \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\nfrom his window, and the burglar\u2019s running away. It is\nsimply not the case, as the Court apparently believes, that\nwould-be home entries are often reduced to attempted\nhome entries by physical confrontation between home\nowner and criminal while the latter is still outside the\nhouse. (One must envision a householder throwing open\nhis front door, shotgun in hand, just as the would-be bur\nglar is trying to pick the lock.)\n  As we have previously stated, it is \u201c[t]he fact that an\noffender enters a building to commit a crime [that] creates\nthe possibility of a violent confrontation between the\noffender and an occupant, caretaker, or some other person\nwho comes to investigate.\u201d Taylor, supra, at 588 (empha\nsis added); see also Leocal, supra, at 10 (\u201c[B]urglary, by its\n14                   JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnature, involves a substantial risk that the burglar will\nuse force against a victim in completing the crime\u201d (em\nphasis added)). By definition, a perpetrator who has been\nconvicted only of attempted burglary has failed to make it\ninside the home or workplace. (Indeed, a criminal con\nvicted only of attempted burglary almost certainly injured\nno one; otherwise, he would have been convicted of some\nthing far more serious, such as assault or murder.) Thus,\nthe full extent of the risk that burglary poses\u2014the entry\ninto the home that makes burglary such a threat to the\nphysical safety of its victim\u2014is necessarily absent in\nattempted burglary, however \u201cattempt\u201d is defined.\n  Because attempted burglary categorically poses a less\n\u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d than\nburglary, the least risky of ACCA\u2019s enumerated crimes, I\nwould hold that it cannot be a predicate \u201cviolent felony\u201d\nfor purposes of ACCA\u2019s mandatory minimum sentencing\nenhancement, \u00a7924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), regardless\nof how close a State\u2019s attempt statute requires the perpe\ntrator come to completing the underlying offense.5\n                             D\n   The Court observes, with undoubted accuracy, that my\napproach is not perfect. It leaves it to courts to decide,\n\u201c[w]ithout hard statistics\u201d to guide them, ante, at 16, the\ndegree of risk of physical injury posed by various crimes.\nBut this is an imponderable that cannot be avoided when\ndealing with a statute that turns upon \u201ca serious potential\nrisk of physical injury to another.\u201d It inheres in the\nCourt\u2019s puny solution as well (how does the Court know\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 There is no need to apply the modified categorical approach in this\n\ncase. Under that approach, the most the Government could achieve\nwould be to narrow the type of Florida burglary underlying James\u2019s\nconviction so that it falls within generic ACCA burglary. As I discussed\nabove, however, even the attempt to commit a generic ACCA burglary\ncould not qualify as a violent felony under ACCA. Thus, there is no\nneed to remand; the Eleventh Circuit should simply be reversed.\n                     Cite as: 550 U.

And there is little doubt of that. For in\naddition to leaving up in the air for judicial determination\nhow much risk of physical injury each crime presents, the\nCourt\u2019s uninformative opinion leaves open, to be guessed\nat by lower courts and by those subjected to this law: (1)\nwhether the degree of risk covered by the residual provi\nsion is limited by the degrees of risk presented by the\nenumerated crimes;6 (2) if so, whether extortion is to be\ngiven its broadest meaning, which would embrace crimes\nwith virtually no risk of physical injury; and most impor\ntantly (3) where in the world to set the minimum risk of\nphysical injury that will qualify. This indeed leaves the\nlower courts and those subject to this law to sail upon a\nvirtual sea of doubt. The only thing the Court decides\n(and that, in my view, erroneously) is that attempted\nburglary poses the same risk of physical injury as bur\nglary, and hence is covered without the need to address\nthese other bothersome questions (how wonderfully\nconvenient!).\n  It is only the Court\u2019s decision-averse solution that en\nables it to accuse me of \u201cunnecessarily decid[ing]\u201d the\nmeaning of extortion, ante, at 15. The Court accurately,\nbut quite irrelevantly, asserts the following:\n     \u201c[E]ven if an unenumerated offense could not qualify\n     without presenting at least as much risk as the least\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Court plays with this question, but does not resolve it, merely\nstating that there is a \u201cpossibility that an offense may present \u2018a\nserious risk of physical injury to another\u2019 without presenting as great a\nrisk as any of the enumerated offenses.\u201d Ante, at 16. Of course, in light\nof its ultimate conclusion regarding attempted burglary, the Court\ncould not resolve this question without being guilty of what it accuses\nme of: \u201cunnecessarily decid[ing] an important question,\u201d ante, at 15;\nany pronouncement on this point would be pure dictum.\n16                JAMES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n     risky of the enumerated offenses, it would not be nec\n     essary to identify the least risky of those offenses in\n     order to decide this case. Rather, it would be suffi\n     cient to establish simply that the unenumerated of\n     fense presented at least as much risk as one of the\n     enumerated offenses.\u201d Ante, at 16 (emphasis added).\nThat is true enough, and I would be properly criticized for\nreaching an unnecessary question if, like the Court, I\nfound attempted burglary to be as risky as burglary.\nSince I do not, however, it is unavoidable that I determine\nthe meaning of extortion, in order to decide whether at\ntempted burglary is less risky than that. The Court\u2019s\ncriticism amounts to nothing more than a procedural\nquibble: Instead of deciding, as I have, (1) that arson and\nthe use of explosives are the most risky of the enumerated\ncrimes; (2) that as between burglary and extortion, bur\nglary is the less risky (a determination requiring me to\ndecide the meaning of extortion); and finally (3) that at\ntempted burglary is less risky than burglary, I should\nhave decided (1) that attempted burglary is less risky than\narson, the use of explosives, and burglary; and only then\n(2) that attempted burglary is less risky than extortion (a\ndetermination requiring me to decide the meaning of\nextortion). Perhaps so, but it is surely a distinction with\nout a real-world difference. Under either approach, de\ntermining the meaning of extortion is unquestionably\nnecessary.\n                           III\n  Congress passed ACCA to enhance punishment for gun-\nwielding offenders who have, inter alia, previously com\nmitted crimes that pose a \u201cserious potential risk of physi\ncal injury to another.\u201d Congress provided examples of\ncrimes that meet this eminently reasonable but entirely\nabstract condition. Unfortunately, however, the four\nexamples have little in common, most especially with\n                     Cite as: 550 U.

S., at 357;\nLanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939).\n   I would choose either the third option (which I have\ntried to implement) or the fourth, since I believe the first\ntwo to be impermissible. If Congress wanted the first\u2014\nsubjecting all repeat offenders to a 15-year mandatory\nminimum prison term\u2014it could very easily have crafted a\nstatute which said that. ACCA, with its tedious definition\nof \u201cviolent felony,\u201d was obviously not meant to have such\nan effect. The second option (the one chosen by the Court\ntoday)\u2014essentially leaving it to the courts to apply the\nvague language in a manner that is ex ante (if not at the\nend of the day) highly unpredictable\u2014violates, in my view,\nthe constitutional prohibition against vague criminal\nlaws.7 Congress has simply abdicated its responsibility\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The Court contends that the provision at issue here, even when left\n\nentirely unexplained (as today\u2019s opinion skillfully accomplishes) cannot\nbe unconstitutionally vague, because \u201c[s]imilar formulations have been\nused in other federal and state criminal statutes.\u201d Ante, at 17, n. 6.\nNone of the provisions the Court cites, however, is similar in the crucial\nrelevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined re\nquirement of risk of physical injury with the word \u201cotherwise,\u201d preceded\nby four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to\nthe supposedly defining characteristic.

We hold that it is, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Alphonso James pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony, in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1). In his guilty plea, James admitted to the three prior felony convictions listed in his federal indictment. These included a conviction in Florida state court for attempted burglary of a dwelling, in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 810.02 and 777.04.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>At sentencing, the Government argued that James was subject to ACCA's 15-year mandatory minimum term because of his three prior convictions. James objected, arguing that his attempted burglary conviction did not qualify as a \"violent felony\" under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The District Court held that attempted burglary is a violent felony, and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed that holding, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77147\"><a href=\"/opinion/77147/usa-v-alphonso-james-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span>, 1157 (2005). We granted certiorari, 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2860, 165 L.Ed.2d 894 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>ACCA's 15-year mandatory minimum applies \"[i]n the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title [the felon in possession of a firearm provision] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1591</span> and has three prior convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(1). ACCA defines a \"violent felony\" as</p>\n<blockquote>\"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that \u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 924(2)(B).</blockquote>\n<p>Florida defined the crime of burglary at the time of James' conviction as follows: \"`Burglary' means entering or remaining in a structure or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter or remain.\" Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(1) (1993). Florida's criminal attempt statute provided: \"A person who attempts to commit an offense prohibited by law and in such attempt does any act toward the commission of such offense, but fails in the perpetration or is intercepted or prevented in the execution thereof, commits the offense of criminal attempt.\" \u00a7 777.04(1). The attempted burglary conviction at issue here was punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</p>\n<p>The parties agree that attempted burglary does not qualify as a \"violent felony\" under clause (i) of ACCA's definition because it does not have \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Nor does it qualify as one of the specific crimes enumerated in clause (ii). Attempted burglary is not robbery or extortion. It does not involve the use of explosives. And it is not \"burglary\" because it does not meet the definition of burglary under ACCA that this Court set forth in <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990): \"an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\" See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 777.04(1) (crime of attempt under Florida law requires as an element that the defendant \"fai[l] in the perpetration or [be] intercepted or prevented in the execution\" of the underlying offense).</p>\n<p>The question before the Court, then, is whether attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, falls within ACCA's residual provision for crimes that \"otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Before determining whether the elements of attempted burglary under Florida law qualify under ACCA's residual provision, we first consider James' argument that the statute's text and structure categorically exclude attempt offenses from the scope of the residual provision. We conclude that nothing in the plain language of clause (ii), when read together with the rest of the statute, prohibits attempt offenses from qualifying as ACCA predicates when they involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n<p>James first argues that the residual provision of clause (ii) must be read in conjunction with clause (i), which expressly includes in its definition of \"violent felony\" offenses that have \"as an element the ... <i>attempted use</i> ... of physical force against another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added). James thus concludes that Congress' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1592</span> express inclusion of attempt offenses in clause (i), combined with its failure to mention attempts in clause (ii), demonstrates an intent to categorically exclude attempt offenses from the latter provision.</p>\n<p>We are not persuaded. James' reading would unduly narrow clause (ii)'s residual provision, the language of which does not suggest any intent to exclude attempt offenses that otherwise meet the statutory criteria. Clause (i), in contrast, lacks a broad residual provision, thus making it necessary to specify exactly what types of offenses \u0097 including attempt offenses \u0097 are covered by its language. In short, \"the expansive phrasing of\" clause (ii) \"points directly away from the sort of exclusive specification\" that James would read into it. <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121147\"><a href=\"/opinion/121147/chevron-usa-inc-v-echazabal/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 80, 122 S.Ct. 2045, 153 L.Ed.2d 82 (2002); see also <i>United States v.

He argues that the \"common attribute\" of the offenses specifically enumerated in clause (ii) \u0097 burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives \u0097 is that they are all completed offenses. The residual provision, he contends, should similarly be read to extend only to completed offenses.</p>\n<p>This argument is unavailing. As an initial matter, the premise on which it depends \u0097 that clause (ii)'s specifically enumerated crimes are limited to completed offenses \u0097 is false. An unsuccessful attempt to blow up a government building, for example, would qualify as a specifically enumerated predicate offense because it would \"involv[e][the] use of explosives.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 844(f)(1) (making it a crime to \"maliciously damag[e] or destro[y], or <i>attemp[t]</i> to damage or destroy, by means of fire or an explosive,\" certain property used in or affecting interstate commerce (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>In any event, the most relevant common attribute of the enumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives use is not \"completion.\" Rather, it is that all of these offenses, while not technically crimes against the person, nevertheless create significant risks of bodily injury or confrontation that might result in bodily injury. As we noted in <i>Taylor,</i></p>\n<blockquote>\"Congress thought that certain general categories of property crimes \u0097 namely burglary, arson, extortion, and the use of explosives \u0097 so often presented a risk of injury to persons, or were so often committed by career criminals, that they should be included in the enhancement statute even though, considered solely in terms of their statutory elements, they do not necessarily involve the use or threat of force against a person.\" 495 U.S., at 597, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</blockquote>\n<p>See also <i>id.,</i> at 588, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (noting that Congress singled out burglary because it \"often creates the possibility of a violent confrontation\"); <i>United States v. Adams,</i> 51 Fed.Appx. 507, 508 (C.A.6 2002) (arson presents \"a serious risk of physical injury to another\" because \"[n]ot only might the targeted building be occupied,\" but also \"the fire could harm firefighters and onlookers and could spread to occupied structures\"); H.R.Rep. No. 99-849, p. 3 (1986) (purpose of clause (ii) was to \"add State and Federal crimes against property <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1593</span> such as burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives and similar crimes as predicate offenses where the conduct involved presents a serious risk of injury to a person\").</p>\n<p>Congress' inclusion of a broad residual provision in clause (ii) indicates that it did not intend the preceding enumerated offenses to be an exhaustive list of the types of crimes that might present a serious risk of injury to others and therefore merit status as a \u00a7 924(e) predicate offense. Nothing in the statutory language supports the view that Congress intended to limit this category solely to completed offenses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>James also relies on ACCA's legislative history to buttress his argument that clause (ii) categorically excludes attempt offenses. In the deliberations leading up to ACCA's adoption in 1984, the House rejected a version of the statute that would have provided enhanced penalties for use of a firearm by persons with two prior convictions for \"any robbery or burglary offense, <i>or a conspiracy or attempt to commit such an offense.</i>\" S. 52, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 2 (1984) (emphasis added). The bill that ultimately became law omitted any reference to attempts, and simply defined \"violent felony\" to include \"robbery or burglary, or both.\" Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, \u00a7 1802, 98 Stat. 2185, repealed in 1986 by Pub.L. 99-308, \u00a7 104(b), 100 Stat. 459. James argues that Congress' rejection of this explicit \"attempt\" language in 1984 evidenced an intent to exclude attempted burglary as a predicate offense.</p>\n<p>Whatever weight this legislative history might ordinarily have, we do not find it probative here, because the 1984 enactment on which James relies was not Congress' last word on the subject. In 1986, Congress amended ACCA for the purpose of \"`expanding' the range of predicate offenses.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 584, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The 1986 amendments added the more expansive language that is at issue in this case \u0097 including clause (ii)'s language defining as violent felonies offenses that are \"burglary, arson, extortion, involv[e] use of explosives, or otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" Career Criminals Amendment Act of 1986, \u00a7 1402(b), 100 Stat. 3207-40, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This language is substantially broader than the 1984 provision that it amended. Because both the Government and the Court of Appeals relied on the broader language of the 1986 amendments \u0097 specifically, the residual provision \u0097 as the textual basis for including attempted burglary within the law's scope, Congress' rejection of express language including attempt offenses in the 1984 provision is not dispositive. Congress did not consider, much less reject, any such language when it enacted the 1986 amendments. What it did consider, and ultimately adopted, was a broadly worded residual clause that does not by its terms exclude attempt offenses, and whose reach is broad enough to encompass at least some such offenses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Having concluded that neither the statutory text nor the legislative history discloses any congressional intent to categorically exclude attempt offenses from the scope of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)'s residual provision, we next ask whether attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, is an offense that \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" In answering this question, we employ the \"`categorical approach'\" that this Court has taken with respect to other offenses under ACCA. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1594</span> Under this approach, we \"`look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense,'\" and do not generally consider the \"particular facts disclosed by the record of conviction.\" <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 17, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (quoting <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143). That is, we consider whether the <i>elements of the offense</i> are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We begin by examining what constitutes attempted burglary under Florida law. On its face, Florida's attempt statute requires only that a defendant take \"any act toward the commission\" of burglary. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 777.04(1). James contends that this broad statutory language sweeps in merely preparatory activity that poses no real danger of harm to others \u0097 for example, acquiring burglars' tools or casing a structure while planning a burglary.</p>\n<p>But while the statutory language is broad, the Florida Supreme Court has considerably narrowed its application in the context of attempted burglary, requiring an \"overt act directed toward entering or remaining in a structure or conveyance.\" <i>Jones v. State,</i> 608 So.2d 797, 799 (1992). Mere preparation is not enough. See <i>ibid.</i><sup>[2]</sup> Florida's lower courts appear to have consistently applied this heightened standard. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Richardson v. State,</i> 922 So.2d 331, 334 (App.2006); <i>Davis v. State,</i> 741 So.2d 1213, 1214 (App.1999).</p>\n<p>The pivotal question, then, is whether overt conduct directed toward unlawfully entering or remaining in a dwelling, with the intent to commit a felony therein, is \"conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In answering this question, we look to the statutory language for guidance. The specific offenses enumerated in clause (ii) provide one baseline from which to measure whether other similar conduct \"otherwise... presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" In this case, we can ask whether the risk posed by attempted burglary is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses \u0097 here, completed burglary. See <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 600, n. 9, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (\"The Government remains free to argue that any offense \u0097 including offenses similar to generic burglary \u0097 should count towards enhancement as one that `otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another' under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\").</p>\n<p>The main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another's property, but rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party \u0097 whether an occupant, a police officer, or a bystander \u0097 who comes to investigate. That is, the risk arises not from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1595</span> the completion of the burglary, but from the possibility that an innocent person might appear while the crime is in progress.</p>\n<p>Attempted burglary poses the same kind of risk. Interrupting an intruder at the doorstep while the would-be burglar is attempting a break-in creates a risk of violent confrontation comparable to that posed by finding him inside the structure itself. As one court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In all of these cases the risk of injury arises, not from the completion of the break-in, but rather from the possibility that some innocent party may appear on the scene while the break-in is occurring. This is just as likely to happen before the defendant succeeds in breaking in as after. Indeed, the possibility may be at its peak while the defendant is still outside trying to break in, as that is when he is likely to be making noise and exposed to the public view ... . [T]here is a serious risk of confrontation while a perpetrator is attempting to enter the building.\" <i>United States v. Payne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584181\"><a href=\"/opinion/584181/united-states-v-leonard-m-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 8 (C.A.1 1992).</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, the risk posed by an attempted burglary that can serve as the basis for an ACCA enhancement may be even greater than that posed by a typical completed burglary. All burglaries begin as attempted burglaries. But ACCA only concerns that subset of attempted burglaries where the offender has been apprehended, prosecuted, and convicted. This will typically occur when the attempt is thwarted by some outside intervenor \u0097 be it a property owner or law enforcement officer. Many completed burglaries do not involve such confrontations. But attempted burglaries often do; indeed, it is often just such outside intervention that prevents the attempt from ripening into completion.</p>\n<p>Concluding that attempted burglary presents a risk that is comparable to the risk posed by the completed offense, every Court of Appeals that has construed an attempted burglary law similar in scope to Florida's has held that the offense qualifies as a \"violent felony\" under clause (ii)'s residual provision.<sup>[3]</sup> The only cases holding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1596</span> to the contrary involved attempt laws that could be satisfied by preparatory conduct that does not pose the same risk of violent confrontation and physical harm posed by an attempt to enter a structure illegally.<sup>[4]</sup> Given that Florida law, as interpreted by that State's highest court, requires an overt act directed toward the entry of a structure, we need not consider whether the more attenuated conduct encompassed by such laws presents a potential risk of serious injury under ACCA.</p>\n<p>The United States Sentencing Commission has come to a similar conclusion with regard to the Sentencing Guidelines' career offender enhancement, whose definition of a predicate \"crime of violence\" closely tracks ACCA's definition of \"violent felony.\" See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (Nov.2006) (USSG). The Commission has determined that \"crime[s] of violence\" for the purpose of the Guidelines enhancement \"include the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.\" \u00a7 4B1.2, comment., n. 1. This judgment was based on the Commission's review of empirical sentencing data and presumably reflects an assessment that attempt crimes often pose a similar risk of injury as completed offenses. As then-Judge Breyer explained, \"[t]he Commission, which collects detailed sentencing data on virtually every federal criminal case, is better able than any individual court to make an informed judgment about the relation between\" a particular offense and \"the likelihood of accompanying violence.\" <i>United States v. Doe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580696\"><a href=\"/opinion/580696/united-states-v-arthur-l-doe-aka-butchy/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 225 (C.A.1 1992); see also USSG \u00a7 1A3 (Nov.1987), reprinted in \u00a7 1A1.1 comment.

While we are not bound by the Sentencing Commission's conclusion, we view it as further evidence that a crime like attempted burglary poses a risk of violence similar to that presented by the completed offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>James responds that it is not enough that attempted burglary \"`generally'\" or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1597</span> in \"`most cases'\" will create a risk of physical injury to others. Brief for Petitioner 32. Citing the categorical approach we employed in <i>Taylor,</i> he argues that we cannot treat attempted burglary as an ACCA predicate offense unless <i>all</i> cases present such a risk. James' approach is supported by neither the statute's text nor this Court's holding in <i>Taylor.</i></p>\n<p>One could, of course, imagine a situation in which attempted burglary might not pose a realistic risk of confrontation or injury to anyone \u0097 for example, a break-in of an unoccupied structure located far off the beaten path and away from any potential intervenors. But ACCA does not require metaphysical certainty. Rather, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)'s residual provision speaks in terms of a \"potential risk.\" These are inherently probabilistic concepts.<sup>[5]</sup> Indeed, the combination of the two terms suggests that Congress intended to encompass possibilities even more contingent or remote than a simple \"risk,\" much less a certainty. While there may be some attempted burglaries that do not present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, the same is true of completed burglaries \u0097 which are explicitly covered by the statutory language and provide a baseline against which to measure the degree of risk that a non-enumerated offense must \"otherwise\" present in order to qualify.</p>\n<p>James' argument also misapprehends <i>Taylor's</i> categorical approach. We do not view that approach as requiring that every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony. Cf. <i>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 815, 822, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007) (\"[T]o find that a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute's language. It requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime\").</p>\n<p>Rather, the proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another. One can always hypothesize unusual cases in which even a prototypically violent crime might not present a genuine risk of injury \u0097 for example, an attempted murder where the gun, unbeknownst to the shooter, had no bullets, see <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785470\"><a href=\"/opinion/785470/united-states-v-lawrence-e-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span>, 659 (C.A.D.C.2004). Or, to take an example from the offenses specifically enumerated in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), one could imagine an extortion scheme where an anonymous blackmailer threatens to release embarrassing personal information about the victim unless he is mailed regular payments. In both cases, the risk of physical injury to another approaches zero. But that does not mean that the offenses of attempted murder or extortion are categorically nonviolent.</p>\n<p>As long as an offense is of a type that, by its nature, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another, it satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)'s residual provision. Attempted burglary under Florida law \u0097 as construed in <i>Jones</i> to require <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1598</span> an overt act directed toward entry of a structure \u0097 satisfies this test.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>Justice SCALIA's dissent criticizes our approach on the ground that it does not provide sufficient guidance for lower courts required to decide whether unenumerated offenses other than attempted burglary qualify as violent felonies under ACCA. But the dissent's alternative approach has more serious disadvantages. Among other things, that approach unnecessarily decides an important question that the parties have not briefed (the meaning of the term \"extortion\" in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)), decides that question in a way that is hardly free from doubt, and fails to provide an interpretation of the residual provision that furnishes clear guidance for future cases.</p>\n<p>The dissent interprets the residual provision to require at least as much risk as the least dangerous enumerated offense. But the ordinary meaning of the language of the residual clause does not impose such a requirement. What the clause demands is \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" While it may be reasonable to infer that the risks presented by the enumerated offenses involve a risk of this magnitude, it does not follow that an offense that presents a lesser risk necessarily fails to qualify. Nothing in the language of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) rules out the possibility that an offense may present \"a serious risk of physical injury to another\" without presenting as great a risk as any of the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even if an unenumerated offense could not qualify without presenting at least as much risk as the least risky of the enumerated offenses, it would not be necessary to identify the least risky of those offenses in order to decide this case. Rather, it would be sufficient to establish simply that the unenumerated offense presented at least as much risk as one of the enumerated offenses. Thus, Justice SCALIA's interpretation of the meaning of the term \"extortion\" is unnecessary \u0097 and inadvisable. The parties have not briefed this issue, and the proposed interpretation is hardly beyond question. Instead of interpreting the meaning of the term \"extortion\" in accordance with its meaning at common law or in modern federal and state statutes, see <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, it is suggested that we adopt an interpretation that seems to be entirely novel and that greatly reduces the reach of ACCA.</p>\n<p>The stated reason for tackling this question is to provide guidance for the lower courts in future cases \u0097 surely a worthy objective. But in practical terms, the proposed interpretation of the residual clause would not make it much easier for the lower courts to decide whether other unenumerated offenses qualify. Without hard statistics \u0097 and no such statistics have been called to our attention \u0097 how is a lower court to determine whether the risk posed by generic burglary is greater or less than the risk posed by an entirely unrelated unenumerated offense \u0097 say, escape from prison?<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1599</span> In the end, Justice SCALIA's analysis of this case turns on the same question as ours \u0097 <i>i.e.,</i> the comparative risks presented by burglary and attempted burglary. The risk of physical injury in both cases occurs when there is a confrontation between the criminal and another person, whether an occupant of the structure, a law enforcement officer or security guard, or someone else. It is argued that when such an encounter occurs during a consummated burglary (<i>i.e.,</i> after entry), the risk is greater than it is when the encounter occurs during an attempted burglary (<i>i.e.,</i> before entry is effected), and that may be true. But this argument fails to come to grips with the fact that such encounters may occur much more frequently during attempted burglaries because it is precisely due to such encounters that many planned burglaries do not progress beyond the attempt stage. Justice SCALIA dismisses the danger involved when an encounter occur during attempted burglaries, stating that such encounters are \"likely to consist of nothing more than the occupant's yelling, `Who's there?' from his window, and the burglar's running away.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1607. But there are many other possible scenarios. An armed would-be burglar may be spotted by a police officer, a private security guard, or a participant in a neighborhood watch program. Or a homeowner angered by the sort of conduct recited in James' presentence report \u0097 throwing a hammer through a window \u0097 may give chase, and a violent encounter may ensue. For these reasons and the reasons discussed above, we are convinced that the offense of attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, qualifies under ACCA's residual clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Although the question on which this Court granted certiorari focused on the attempt prong of Florida's attempted burglary law, James also argues that the scope of the State's underlying burglary statute itself precludes treating attempted burglary as a violent felony for ACCA purposes. Specifically, he argues that Florida's burglary statute differs from \"generic\" burglary as defined in <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, because it defines a \"`[d]welling'\" to include not only the structure itself, but also the \"curtilage thereof,\"<sup>[7]</sup> Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.011(2) (1993).</p>\n<p>We agree that the inclusion of curtilage takes Florida's underlying offense of burglary outside the definition of \"generic burglary\" set forth in <i>Taylor,</i> which requires an unlawful entry into, or remaining in, \"a <i>building or other structure.</i>\" 495 U.S., at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (emphasis added). But that conclusion is not dispositive, because the Government does not argue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1600</span> that James' conviction for attempted burglary constitutes \"burglary\" under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Rather, it relies on the residual provision of that clause, which \u0097 as the Court has recognized \u0097 can cover conduct that is outside the strict definition of, but nevertheless similar to, generic burglary. <i>Id.,</i> at 600, n. 9, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p>Is the risk posed by an attempted entry of the curtilage comparable to that posed by the attempted entry of a structure (which, as we concluded above, is sufficient to qualify under the residual provision)? We must again turn to state law in order to answer this question.</p>\n<p>The Florida Supreme Court has construed curtilage narrowly, requiring \"some form of an enclosure in order for the area surrounding a residence to be considered part of the `curtilage' as referred to in the burglary statute.\" <i>State v. Hamilton,</i> 660 So.2d 1038, 1044 (1995) (holding that a yard surrounded by trees was not \"curtilage\"); see also <i>United States v. Matthews,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1656444\"><a href=\"/opinion/1656444/state-v-matthews/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span>, 1274 (C.A.11 2006) (\"Florida case law construes curtilage narrowly, to include only an enclosed area surrounding a structure\"). Given this narrow definition, we do not believe that the inclusion of curtilage so mitigates the risk presented by attempted burglary as to take the offense outside the scope of clause (ii)'s residual provision.</p>\n<p>A typical reason for enclosing the curtilage adjacent to a structure is to keep out unwanted visitors \u0097 especially those with criminal motives. And a burglar who illegally attempts to enter the enclosed area surrounding a dwelling creates much the same risk of physical confrontation with a property owner, law enforcement official, or other third party as does one who attempts to enter the structure itself. In light of Florida's narrow definition of curtilage, attempted burglary of the curtilage requires both physical proximity to the structure and an overt act directed toward breaching the enclosure. Such an attempt \"presents a serious potential risk that violence will ensue and someone will be injured.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1275 (holding that burglary of the curtilage is a violent felony under ACCA's residual provision).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Finally, James argues that construing attempted burglary as a violent felony raises Sixth Amendment issues under <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny because it is based on \"judicial fact finding\" about the risk presented by \"the acts that underlie `most' convictions for attempted burglary.\" Brief for Petitioner 34, 35. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p>In determining whether attempted burglary under Florida law qualifies as a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), the Court is engaging in statutory interpretation, not judicial factfinding. Indeed, by applying <i>Taylor's</i> categorical approach, we have avoided any inquiry into the underlying facts of James' particular offense, and have looked solely to the elements of attempted burglary as defined by Florida law. Such analysis raises no Sixth Amendment issue.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1601</span> Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice STEVENS and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I disagree with the Court's basic approach in this case, and must therefore lay out my own.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>As the Court acknowledges, <i>ante,</i> at 1591, the only way attempted burglary can qualify as a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) is by falling within the \"residual provision\" of clause (ii) \u0097 that is, if it is a crime that \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This was the basis for the Eleventh Circuit's decision. (\"We ... hold that an attempt to commit burglary ... presents the potential risk of physical injury to another sufficient to satisfy the ACCA's definition of a `violent felony,'\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77147\"><a href=\"/opinion/77147/usa-v-alphonso-james-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span>, 1157 (2005)), and it is the center of the parties' dispute before this Court.</p>\n<p>The problem with the Court's approach to determining which crimes fit within the residual provision is that it is almost entirely ad hoc. <i>This</i> crime, the Court says, <i>does</i> \"involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" That gets this case off our docket, sure enough. But it utterly fails to do what this Court is supposed to do: provide guidance concrete enough to ensure that the ACCA residual provision will be applied with an acceptable degree of consistency by the hundreds of district judges that impose sentences every day. The one guideline the Court does suggest is that the sentencer should compare the unenumerated offense at issue with the \"closest analog\" among the four offenses that are set forth (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives), and should include the unenumerated offense within ACCA if the risk it poses is \"comparable.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1594. The principal attraction of this test, I suspect, is that it makes it relatively easy to decide the present case (though, as I shall subsequently discuss, I think the Court reaches the wrong conclusion as to whether attempted burglary poses a comparable risk). Assuming that \"comparable\" means \"about the same,\" the Court's test does provide some guidance where the most closely analogous offense is clear (as here) <i>and</i> the risk is comparable. But what if, as will very often be the case, it is not at all obvious which of the four enumerated offenses is the closest analog \u0097 or if (to tell the truth) none of them is analogous at all? Is, for example, driving under the influence of alcohol more analogous to burglary, arson, extortion, or a crime involving use of explosives? And if an analog <i>is</i> identified, what is to be done if the offense at issue does <i>not</i> present a comparable risk? The Court declines to say, but it seems inconceivable that it means the offense to be <i>excluded</i> from ACCA for that reason. For example, it does not comport with any conceivable congressional intent to disqualify an unenumerated crime that is most analogous to arson and presents nowhere near the risk of injury posed by arson, but presents a far <i>greater</i> risk of injury than burglary, which Congress has explicitly included. Thus, for what is probably the vast majority of cases, today's opinion provides no guidance whatever, leaving the lower courts to their own devices in deciding, crime-by-crime, which conviction \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" It will take decades, and dozens of grants of certiorari, to allocate all the Nation's crimes to one or the other side of this entirely reasonable and entirely indeterminate line. Compare <i>ante,</i> at 1595 (concluding that attempted burglary poses sufficient risk), with <i>Leocal v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1602</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137725\"><a href=\"/opinion/137725/leocal-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004) (concluding that driving under the influence of alcohol does not pose a \"substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b)).</p>\n<p>Imprecision and indeterminacy are particularly inappropriate in the application of a criminal statute. Years of prison hinge on the scope of ACCA's residual provision, yet its boundaries are ill defined. If we are not going to deny effect to this statute as being impermissibly vague, see Part III, <i>infra,</i> we have the responsibility to derive from the text rules of application that will provide notice of what is covered and prevent arbitrary or discriminatory sentencing. See <i>Kolender v. Lawson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110926\"><a href=\"/opinion/110926/kolender-v-lawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983). Offenders should be on notice that a particular course of conduct will result in a mandatory minimum prison term of 15 years. The Court prefers to keep them guessing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The residual provision of clause (ii) of ACCA's definition of violent felony \u0097 the clause that sweeps within ACCA's ambit any crime that \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" \u0097 is, to put it mildly, not a model of clarity. I do not pretend to have an all-encompassing solution that provides for crystal-clear application of the statute in all contexts. But we can do much better than today's opinion with what Congress has given us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Eleventh Circuit properly sought to resolve this case by employing the \"categorical approach\" of looking only to the statutory elements of attempted burglary. See 430 F.3d, at 1154, 1156-1157. This \"generally prohibits the later court from delving into particular facts disclosed by the record of conviction, thus leaving the court normally to `look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.'\" <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 17, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (quoting <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)). As the Court does, <i>ante,</i> at 1594, I would also begin with this approach.</p>\n<p>The Government would have us provide some certainty \u0097 at least enough to decide the present case \u0097 by holding that the attempt to commit a crime of violence should be treated the same as the completed crime. It points out that various federal laws, and many state laws, punish attempt with the same sanction as the completed crime. See Brief for United States 18-20. This would be persuasive if punishment were meted out solely on the basis of the risk of physical injury that a crime presents. It seems to me, however, that similar punishment does not necessarily imply similar risk; it more likely represents a judgment that the two crimes display a similar degree of depravity deserving of punishment or needful of deterrence. A person guilty of attempted burglary may not have placed anyone at physical risk, but he was just as <i>willing</i> to do so as the successful burglar. It seems to me impossible to say that equivalence of punishment suggests equivalence of imposed risk. I therefore look elsewhere for some clarification of the statutory text.</p>\n<p>First to invite analysis is the word Congress placed at the forefront of the residual provision: \"otherwise.\" When used as an adverb (as it is in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), modifying the verb \"involves\"), \"otherwise\" is defined as \"[i]n a different manner\" or \"in another way.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 1729 (2d ed.1954). Thus, the most natural reading of the statute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1603</span> is that committing one of the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving explosives) is <i>one way</i> to commit a crime \"involv[ing] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\"; and that <i>other ways</i> of committing a crime of that character similarly constitute \"violent felon[ies].\" In other words, the enumerated crimes are examples of what Congress had in mind under the residual provision, and the residual provision should be interpreted with those examples in mind. This commonsense principle of construction is sometimes referred to as the canon of <i>ejusdem generis:</i> \"[W]hen a general word or phrase follows a list of specific persons or things, the general word or phrase will be interpreted to include only persons or things of the same type as those listed.\" Black's Law Dictionary 535 (7th ed. 1999) (Black's) see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122259\"><a href=\"/opinion/122259/washington-state-dept-of-social-and-health-servs-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 384-385, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 154 L.Ed.2d 972 (2003). In this case, the application of that principle suggests that what the residual provision means by the general phrase \"conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" is conduct that resembles, insofar as the degree of such risk is concerned, the previously enumerated crimes.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In another context, I might conclude that any degree of risk that is merely <i>similar,</i> even if <i>slightly less,</i> would qualify. Obviously, such an interpretation would leave a good deal of ambiguity on the downside: How low on the risk scale can one go before the risk becomes <i>too</i> dissimilar from the enumerated crimes? Since the text sets forth no criterion, courts might vary dramatically in their answer. Cf. <i>Leocal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137725\"><a href=\"/opinion/137725/leocal-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (reversing the Eleventh Circuit's determination that driving under the influence of alcohol qualifies as a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16). Where it is reasonably avoidable, such indeterminateness is unacceptable in the context of criminal sanctions. The rule of lenity, grounded in part on the need to give \"`fair warning'\" of what is encompassed by a criminal statute, <i>United States v. Bass,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108421\"><a href=\"/opinion/108421/united-states-v-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 348, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) (quoting <i>McBoyle v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101695\"><a href=\"/opinion/101695/mcboyle-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931)), demands that we give this text the more narrow reading of which it is susceptible. The requirement that the degree of risk be similar to that for the enumerated crimes means that it be no lesser than the risk posed by the least dangerous of those enumerated crimes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>I would turn, then, to the next logical question: Which of the four enumerated crimes \u0097 burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving use of explosives \u0097 poses the least \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another\"? The two that involve use of fire or explosives cannot possibly qualify. Thus, the question I must address is whether burglary or extortion poses a lesser risk. To do so, I must first define those crimes.</p>\n<p>In <i>Taylor,</i> we defined \"burglary\" as used in the very provision of ACCA at issue here. We first determined that \"`burglary' in \u00a7 924(e) must have some <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1604</span> uniform definition independent of the labels employed by the various States' criminal codes.\" 495 U.S., at 592, 110 S.Ct. 2143. We considered but rejected the common-law definition, finding that \"the contemporary understanding of `burglary' has diverged a long way from its common-law roots.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 593, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Ultimately, we concluded that \"Congress meant by `burglary' the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143. To determine that sense, we looked for guidance to W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) and the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code (1980). We defined \"burglary\" as \"any crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p>In defining \"extortion\" for purposes of ACCA, I would follow the same approach. \"At common law, extortion was a property offense committed by a public official who took `any money or thing of value' that was not due to him under the pretense that he was entitled to such property by virtue of his office.\" <i>Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122260\"><a href=\"/opinion/122260/scheidler-v-national-organization-for-women-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 402, 123 S.Ct. 1057, 154 L.Ed.2d 991 (2003) (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 141 (1769), and citing 3 R. Anderson, Wharton's Criminal Law and Procedure \u00a7 1393, pp. 790-791 (1957)); see also 3 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 20.4 (2d ed.2003). As with burglary, however, modern conceptions of extortion have gone well beyond the common-law understanding. In the Hobbs Act, for example, Congress \"explicitly `expanded the common-law definition of extortion to include acts by private individuals.'\" <i>Scheidler, supra,</i> at 402, 123 S.Ct. 1057 (quoting <i>Evans v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112738\"><a href=\"/opinion/112738/evans-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 261, 112 S.Ct. 1881, 119 L.Ed.2d 57 (1992)). And whereas the Hobbs Act retained the common-law requirement that something of value actually be <i>acquired</i> by the extortionist, <i>Scheidler, supra,</i> at 404-405, 123 S.Ct. 1057, the majority of state statutes require only \"that the defendant make a threat with <i>intent</i> thereby to acquire the victim's property,\" 3 LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 20.4(a)(1), at 199 (emphasis added). Further, under most state statutes, the category of qualifying threats has expanded dramatically, to include threats to: \"kill the victim in the future,\" \"cause economic harm,\" \"`bring about or continue a strike, boycott or other collective unofficial action,' \" \"unlawfully detain,\" \"accuse the victim of a crime,\" \"expose some disgraceful defect or secret of the victim which, when known, would subject him to public ridicule or disgrace,\" and \"impair one's credit or business repute.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 20.4(a)(4), at 200, 201.</p>\n<p>The Model Penal Code's definition of \"Theft by Extortion\" reflects this expansive modern notion of the crime:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A person is guilty of theft [by extortion] if he purposely obtains property of another by threatening to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) inflict bodily injury on anyone or commit any other criminal offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) accuse anyone of a criminal offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(3) expose any secret tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or to impair his credit or business repute; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(4) take or withhold action as an official, or cause an official to take or withhold action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(5) bring about or continue a strike, boycott or other collective unofficial action, if the property is not demanded or received for the benefit of the group in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1605</span> whose interest the actor purports to act; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(6) testify or provide information or withhold testimony or information with respect to another's legal claim or defense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(7) inflict any other harm which would not benefit the actor.\" \u00a7 223.4.</blockquote>\n<p>Other federal statutes, including the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, the Travel Act, \u00a7 1952 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), \u00a7 1961 <i>et seq.,</i> use a similarly broad conception of extortion. See <i>United States v. Nardello,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107815\"><a href=\"/opinion/107815/united-states-v-nardello/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span>, 89 S.Ct. 534, 21 L.Ed.2d 487 (1969) (Travel Act); <i>Scheidler, supra</i> (Hobbs Act and RICO).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The word \"extortion\" in ACCA's definition of \"violent felony\" cannot, however, incorporate the full panoply of threats that would qualify under the Model Penal Code, many of which are inherently nonviolent. I arrive at this conclusion for two reasons: First, another canon of statutory construction, <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> which counsels that \"the meaning of an unclear word or phrase should be determined by the words immediately surrounding it.\" Black's 1084; see <i>Keffeler,</i> 537 U.S., at 384-385, 123 S.Ct. 1017. Of course <i>noscitur a sociis</i> is just an erudite (or some would say antiquated) way of saying what common sense tells us to be true: \"[A] word is known by the company it keeps,\" <i>Jarecki v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106270\"><a href=\"/opinion/106270/jarecki-v-gd-searle-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 307, 81 S.Ct. 1579, 6 L.Ed.2d 859 (1961) \u0097 that is to say, which of various possible meanings a word should be given must be determined in a manner that makes it \"fit\" with the words with which it is closely associated. The words immediately surrounding \"extortion\" in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) are \"burglary,\" \"arson,\" and crimes \"involv[ing] use of explosives.\" The Model Penal Code's sweeping definition of extortion would sit uncomfortably indeed amidst this list of crimes which, as the \"otherwise\" residual provision makes plain, are characterized by their potential for violence and their risk of physical harm to others. ACCA's usage of \"extortion\" differs from the context in which the word appears in the Travel Act, where it is one of a list of crimes \"often used by organized crime to collect ... revenue,\" <i>Nardello, supra,</i> at 291, n. 8, 89 S.Ct. 534, including bribery. And it differs from the context in which \"extortion\" appears in RICO, where it is part of a laundry list of nearly every federal crime under the sun. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1606</span> What is suggested by the canon is reinforced by the fact that both the original common-law notion of extortion, and the full expanse of the modern definition, include crimes so inherently <i>unlikely</i> to cause physical harm that it would set the bar of the residual provision at a level that could embrace virtually any offense \u0097 making the limitation to \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" utterly incomprehensible.<sup>[4]</sup> See Part III, <i>infra.</i> I therefore assume that extortion under ACCA is: the obtaining of something of value from another, with his consent, induced by the wrongful use or threatened use of force against the person or property of another. Cf. <i>Leocal,</i> 543 U.S., at 13, 125 S.Ct. 377 (discussing the relationship between the \"use of force against the person or property of another\" and \"crime[s] of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\").</p>\n<p>One final consideration is worthy of mention. I must make sure that my restricted definition of generic extortion does not render the inclusion of extortion in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) superfluous in light of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). \"It is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\" <i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269282/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 174, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Clause (i) already includes in ACCA's definition of \"violent felony\" any crime that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" My narrow definition of extortion passes the surplusage test only if it includes crimes that would not be covered by this provision. That is not a problem, since my definition includes the use or threatened use of force against property, whereas clause (i) is limited to force against the person. Thus, the obtaining of someone else's money by threatening to wreck his place of business would fit within clause (ii) but not within clause (i).</p>\n<p>Having defined burglary and extortion, I return to the question that launched this investigation in the first place: Which of the two poses the least \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another\"? Recall the definitions: burglary is the \"unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime\"; extortion is \"the obtaining of something of value from another, with his consent, induced by the wrongful use or threatened use of force against the person or property of another.\" Every victim of extortion is the object of a threat, to his person or his property; if he ignores that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1607</span> threat, or resists it by seeking to protect his property, he may be harmed. Burglary, on the other hand, involves only the <i>possibility</i> that a confrontation will take place while the crime is underway; the risk of physical harm can become a reality only if the property owner happens to be present, a situation which the burglar ordinarily seeks to avoid. The extortionist, moreover, has already expressed his willingness to commit a violent act; the burglar may be prepared to flee at the first sign of human presence. I think it obvious that burglary is less inherently risky than extortion, and thus the least inherently risky of the four crimes enumerated in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Having concluded in Part II-A that a crime may qualify under ACCA's violent felony residual provision only if it poses at least as much risk of physical injury to another as the least risky of the enumerated crimes; and in Part II-B that the least risky of the enumerated crimes is burglary; I am finally able to turn to the ultimate question posed by this case: Does <i>attempted</i> burglary categorically qualify as a violent felony under ACCA's residual provision? Or as my analysis has recast that question, does attempted burglary categorically involve conduct that poses at least as much risk of physical injury to another as completed burglary? Contrary to what the Court says, <i>ante,</i> at 1594-1597, the answer must be no.</p>\n<p>In <i>Taylor,</i> we discussed the risks posed by the conduct involved in a completed burglary. We found it significant that a burglary involves \"invasion of victims' homes or workplaces,\" 495 U.S., at 581, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted), and we dwelled on such an invasion's \"inherent potential for harm to persons,\" <i>id.,</i> at 588, 110 S.Ct. 2143. In comparing attempted burglary to completed burglary, the Court focuses almost exclusively on \"the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1594. But it ignores numerous other factors that make a completed burglary far more dangerous than a failed one: the closer proximity between burglar and victim where a confrontation takes place inside the confined space of the victim's home; the greater likelihood of the victim's initiating violence inside his home to protect his family and property; the greater likelihood that any confrontation inside the home will be between the burglar and the <i>occupant</i> of the home, rather than the <i>police.</i> The so-called \"confrontation\" the Court envisions between a would-be burglar and a third party while the burglar is still <i>outside</i> the home is likely to consist of nothing more than the occupant's yelling \"Who's there?\" from his window, and the burglar's running away. It is simply not the case, as the Court apparently believes, that would-be home entries are often reduced to <i>attempted</i> home entries by <i>physical confrontation</i> between homeowner and criminal while the latter is still outside the house. (One must envision a householder throwing open his front door, shotgun in hand, just as the would-be burglar is trying to pick the lock.)</p>\n<p>As we have previously stated, it is \"[t]he fact that an offender <i>enters</i> a building to commit a crime [that] creates the possibility of a violent confrontation between the offender and an occupant, caretaker, or some other person who comes to investigate.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 588, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (emphasis added); see also <i>Leocal, supra,</i> at 10, 125 S.Ct. 377 (\"[B]urglary, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim <i>in completing the crime</i>\" (emphasis added)). By definition, a perpetrator who has been convicted only of attempted burglary has failed to make it inside the home or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1608</span> workplace. (Indeed, a criminal convicted only of attempted burglary almost certainly injured no one; otherwise, he would have been convicted of something far more serious, such as assault or murder.) Thus, the full extent of the risk that burglary poses \u0097 the entry into the home that makes burglary such a threat to the physical safety of its victim \u0097 is necessarily absent in attempted burglary, however \"attempt\" is defined.</p>\n<p>Because attempted burglary categorically poses a less \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" than burglary, the least risky of ACCA's enumerated crimes, I would hold that it cannot be a predicate \"violent felony\" for purposes of ACCA's mandatory minimum sentencing enhancement, \u00a7 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), regardless of how close a State's attempt statute requires the perpetrator come to completing the underlying offense.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>The Court observes, with undoubted accuracy, that my approach is not perfect. It leaves it to courts to decide, \"[w]ithout hard statistics\" to guide them, <i>ante,</i> at 1598, the degree of risk of physical injury posed by various crimes. But this is an imponderable that cannot be avoided when dealing with a statute that turns upon \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" It inheres in the Court's puny solution as well (how does the Court know that attempted burglary poses the same risk as burglary?). What this dissent must establish is not that my solution is perfect, but that it is substantially better than what the Court proposes. And there is little doubt of that. For <i>in addition</i> to leaving up in the air for judicial determination how much risk of physical injury each crime presents, the Court's uninformative opinion leaves open, to be guessed at by lower courts and by those subjected to this law: (1) whether the degree of risk covered by the residual provision is limited by the degrees of risk presented by the enumerated crimes;<sup>[6]</sup> (2) if so, whether extortion is to be given its broadest meaning, which would embrace crimes with virtually no risk of physical injury; and most importantly (3) where in the world to set the <i>minimum</i> risk of physical injury that will qualify. This indeed leaves the lower courts and those subject to this law to sail upon a virtual sea of doubt. The <i>only</i> thing the Court decides (and that, in my view, erroneously) is that attempted burglary poses the same risk of physical injury as burglary, and hence is covered without the need to address these other bothersome questions (how wonderfully convenient!).</p>\n<p>It is only the Court's decision-averse solution that enables it to accuse me of \"unnecessarily decid[ing]\" the meaning of extortion, <i>ante,</i> at 1598. The Court accurately, but quite irrelevantly, asserts the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1609</span> \"[E]ven if an unenumerated offense could not qualify without presenting at least as much risk as the least risky of the enumerated offenses, it would not be necessary to identify the least risky of those offenses in order to decide this case. Rather, it would be sufficient to establish simply that the unenumerated offense presented at least as much risk as <i>one</i> of the enumerated offenses.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1598 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>That is true enough, and I would be properly criticized for reaching an unnecessary question if, like the Court, I found attempted burglary to be as risky as burglary. Since I do not, however, it is unavoidable that I determine the meaning of extortion, in order to decide whether attempted burglary is less risky than <i>that.</i> The Court's criticism amounts to nothing more than a procedural quibble: Instead of deciding, as I have, (1) that attempted burglary is clearly less risky than arson or use of explosives, (2) that of the remaining two enumerated crimes burglary is the less risky, and then (3) that attempted burglary is less risky than burglary, I should have followed step (1) with step (3), and only then have proceeded to determine the meaning of extortion. Perhaps so, but it is surely a distinction without a real-world difference. Under either approach, determining the meaning of extortion is unquestionably <i>necessary.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Congress passed ACCA to enhance punishment for gun-wielding offenders who have, <i>inter alia,</i> previously committed crimes that pose a \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" Congress provided examples of crimes that meet this eminently reasonable but entirely abstract condition. Unfortunately, however, the four examples have little in common, most especially with respect to the level of risk of physical injury they pose. Such shoddy draftsmanship puts courts to a difficult choice: They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, see n. 4, <i>supra;</i> (2) apply it case-by-case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness, see <i>Kolender,</i> 461 U.S., at 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855; <i>Lanzetta v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103170\"><a href=\"/opinion/103170/lanzetta-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span>, 453, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939).</p>\n<p>I would choose either the third option (which I have tried to implement) or the fourth, since I believe the first two to be impermissible. If Congress wanted the first \u0097 subjecting <i>all</i> repeat offenders to a 15-year mandatory minimum prison term \u0097 it could very easily have crafted a statute which said that. ACCA, with its tedious definition of \"violent felony,\" was obviously not meant to have such an effect. The second option (the one chosen by the Court today) \u0097 essentially leaving it to the courts to apply the vague language in a manner that is <i>ex ante</i> (if not at the end of the day) highly unpredictable \u0097 violates, in my view, the constitutional prohibition against vague criminal laws.<sup>[7]</sup> Congress has simply abdicated its responsibility when it passes a criminal statute insusceptible of an interpretation that enables principled, predictable application; and this Court has abdicated its responsibility when <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1610</span> it allows that.

Section 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), however, mandated a minimum 15-year sentence if James had three prior convictions for \"a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\" James admitted he had been convicted of three prior felonies, but he argued that one of those felonies \u0097 his conviction for attempted burglary of a dwelling, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 810.02 and 777.04 (2006) \u0097 was not a \"violent felony\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).

See <i>post,</i> at 1609. The statutory requirement that an unenumerated crime \"otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" is not so indefinite as to prevent an ordinary person from understanding what conduct it prohibits. See <i>Kolender v.

Similar formulations have been used in other federal and state criminal statutes. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(a)(1)(B) (defining \"terrorist act\" as conduct that, among other things, \"creates a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to any other person\"); Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13-2508(A)(2) (West 2001) (offense of resisting arrest requires preventing an officer from effectuating an arrest by \"any ... means creating a substantial risk of causing physical injury to the peace officer or another\"); Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 42400.3(b) (West 2006) (criminalizing air pollution that \"results in any unreasonable risk of great bodily injury to, or death of, any person\"); N.Y. Penal Law Ann. \u00a7 490.47 (West Supp. 2007) (\"[c]riminal use of a chemical weapon or biological weapon\" requires \"a grave risk of death or serious physical injury to another person not a participant in the crime\").</p>\n<p>[7]  Burglary under Florida law differs from \"generic\" burglary in a second respect: It extends not just to entries of structures, but also of \"conveyance[s].\" Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(1). But because James (in accordance with what appears to be the general practice in Florida) was specifically charged with and convicted of \"attempted burglary <i>of a dwelling,</i>\" we need not examine this point further.</p>\n<p>[8]  To the extent that James contends that the simple fact of his prior conviction was required to be found by a jury, his position is baseless. James admitted the fact of his prior conviction in his guilty plea, and in any case, we have held that prior convictions need not be treated as an element of the offense for Sixth Amendment purposes. <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p>[1]  The Court imprecisely identifies the common characteristic of the enumerated offenses, and therefore the defining characteristic of the residual provision, as crimes that \"create significant risks of bodily injury or <i>confrontation</i> that might result in bodily injury.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1592 (emphasis added). Of course, adding the word \"confrontation\" is a convenient way of shoehorning attempted burglary into the ambit of the residual provision, but it is an invention entirely divorced from the statutory text.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Hobbs Act contains its own definition of extortion: \"the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2). In <i>Nardello</i> and <i>Scheidler</i> \u0097 where we were required to define generic extortion for purposes of the Travel Act and RICO, both of which leave the term undefined \u0097 we defined it as \"obtaining something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use of force, fear, or threats.\" <i>Scheidler,</i> 537 U.S., at 409, 123 S.Ct. 1057 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Nardello,</i> 393 U.S., at 290, 296, 89 S.Ct. 534 (agreeing with the Government that extortion means \"obtaining something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use of force, fear, or threats\").</p>\n<p>[3]  Two Courts of Appeals have also demonstrated the conundrum posed by Congress's inclusion of extortion in ACCA's list of enumerated violent felonies. See <i>United States v. DeLuca,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195223\"><a href=\"/opinion/195223/united-states-v-deluca/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 8 (C.A.1 1994) (\"The linchpin of [appellant's] theory is the suggestion that all extortions are not equal. ... [W]e give appellant high marks for ingenuity\"); <i>United States v. Anderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602896\"><a href=\"/opinion/602896/united-states-v-brian-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span>, 312 (C.A.9 1993) (Kozinski, J.) (\"Determin[ing] whether a crime [is a violent felony]... is not, with regard to `extortion,' an easy matter. In <i>Taylor,</i> the Court focused on the interstate consensus on the definition of `burglary,'... but there's no such consensus on extortion. ... It's impossible to know which definition the legislators who voted for [ACCA] had in mind. Quite likely most of them weren't thinking of any particular definition at all\"). These Courts ultimately decided to use different definitions of extortion. See <i>DeLuca, supra,</i> at 9 (deciding on the Model Penal Code approach); <i>Anderson, supra,</i> at 313 (deciding on the Hobbs Act definition).</p>\n<p>[4]  The Court explains, for example, that modern extortion could include \"an anonymous blackmailer threaten[ing] to release embarrassing personal information about the victim unless he is mailed regular payments,\" a crime involving a \"risk of physical injury to another approach[ing] zero.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1597. Thus, were the complete modern notion of extortion adopted, it is clear that extortion would be the least risky of the four enumerated crimes. That would mean that any crime posing at least as much risk of physical injury as extortion would qualify under the ACCA residual provision. But virtually any crime could qualify, so that courts would have the power to subject almost any repeat offender to ACCA's 15-year mandatory minimum. Indeed, this seems to be the reality of what is taking place in the lower courts. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791328\"><a href=\"/opinion/791328/united-states-v-michael-w-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></a></span> (C.A.8 2005) (operating a dump truck without consent of the owner is a violent felony under ACCA); <i>United States v. Springfield,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158851\"><a href=\"/opinion/158851/united-states-v-springfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span> (C.A.10 1999) (\"walkaway\" escape from prison honor camp is a violent felony under ACCA).</p>\n<p>[5]  There is no need to apply the modified categorical approach in this case. Under that approach, the most the Government could achieve would be to narrow the type of Florida burglary underlying James's conviction so that it falls within generic ACCA burglary. As I discussed above, however, even the attempt to commit a generic ACCA burglary could not qualify as a violent felony under ACCA. Thus, there is no need to remand; the Eleventh Circuit should simply be reversed.</p>\n<p>[6]  The Court plays with this question, but does not resolve it, merely stating that there is a \"possibility that an offense may present `a serious risk of physical injury to another' without presenting as great a risk as any of the enumerated offenses.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1598. Of course, in light of its ultimate conclusion regarding attempted burglary, the Court could <i>not</i> resolve this question without being guilty of what it accuses me of: \"unnecessarily decid[ing] an important question,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1598; any pronouncement on this point would be pure dictum.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Court contends that the provision at issue here, even when left entirely unexplained (as today's opinion skillfully accomplishes) cannot be unconstitutionally vague, because \"[s]imilar formulations have been used in other federal and state criminal statutes.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1598-1599, n. 6. None of the provisions the Court cites, however, is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word \"otherwise,\" preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The phrase \"shades of red,\" standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase \"fire-engine red, light pink, maroon, <i>navy blue,</i> or colors that otherwise involve shades of red\" assuredly does so.</p>\n\n</div>",
