In recitations preceding its operative provisions the Act refers to the Court's opinion in <i>Stenberg v. Carhart,</i> 530 U.S. 914, 120 S.Ct. 2597, 147 L.Ed.2d 743 (2000), which also addressed the subject of abortion procedures used in the later stages of pregnancy. Compared to the state statute at issue in <i>Stenberg,</i> the Act is more specific concerning the instances to which it applies and in this respect more precise in its coverage. We conclude the Act should be sustained against the objections lodged by the broad, facial attack brought against it.</p>\n<p>In No. 05-380 <i>(Carhart)</i> respondents are LeRoy Carhart, William G. Fitzhugh, William H. Knorr, and Jill L. Vibhakar, doctors who perform second-trimester abortions. These doctors filed their complaint against the Attorney General of the United States in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska. They challenged the constitutionality of the Act and sought a permanent injunction against its enforcement. <i>Carhart v. Ashcroft,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d 805 (2004). In 2004, after a 2-week trial, the District Court granted a permanent injunction that prohibited the Attorney General from enforcing the Act in all cases but those in which there was no dispute the fetus was viable. <i>Id.,</i> at 1048. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 413 F.3d 791 (2005). We granted certiorari. 546 U.S. 1169, 126 S.Ct. 2901, 165 L.Ed.2d 916 (2006).</p>\n<p>In No. 05-1382 <i>(Planned Parenthood)</i> respondents are Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., Planned Parenthood Golden Gate, and the City and County of San Francisco. The Planned Parenthood entities sought to enjoin enforcement of the Act in a suit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. <i>Planned</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1620</span> <i>Parenthood Federation of Am. v. Ashcroft,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d 957 (2004). The City and County of San Francisco intervened as a plaintiff. In 2004, the District Court held a trial spanning a period just short of three weeks, and it, too, enjoined the Attorney General from enforcing the Act. <i>Id.,</i> at 1035. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 435 F.3d 1163 (2006). We granted certiorari. 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2901, 165 L.Ed.2d 916 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Act proscribes a particular manner of ending fetal life, so it is necessary here, as it was in <i>Stenberg,</i> to discuss abortion procedures in some detail. Three United States District Courts heard extensive evidence describing the procedures. In addition to the two courts involved in the instant cases the District Court for the Southern District of New York also considered the constitutionality of the Act. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation v. Ashcroft,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d 436 (2004). It found the Act unconstitutional, <i>id.,</i> at 493, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, <i>Nat. Abortion Federation v. Gonzales,</i> 437 F.3d 278 (2006). The three District Courts relied on similar medical evidence; indeed, much of the evidence submitted to the <i>Carhart</i> court previously had been submitted to the other two courts. 331 F.Supp.2d, at 809-810. We refer to the District Courts' exhaustive opinions in our own discussion of abortion procedures.</p>\n<p>Abortion methods vary depending to some extent on the preferences of the physician and, of course, on the term of the pregnancy and the resulting stage of the unborn child's development. Between 85 and 90 percent of the approximately 1.3 million abortions performed each year in the United States take place in the first three months of pregnancy, which is to say in the first trimester. <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 960, and n. 4; App. in No. 05-1382, pp. 45-48. The most common first-trimester abortion method is vacuum aspiration (otherwise known as suction curettage) in which the physician vacuums out the embryonic tissue. Early in this trimester an alternative is to use medication, such as mifepristone (commonly known as RU-486), to terminate the pregnancy. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 464, n. 20. The Act does not regulate these procedures.</p>\n<p>Of the remaining abortions that take place each year, most occur in the second trimester. The surgical procedure referred to as \"dilation and evacuation\" or \"D &amp; E\" is the usual abortion method in this trimester. <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 960-961. Although individual techniques for performing D &amp; E differ, the general steps are the same.</p>\n<p>A doctor must first dilate the cervix at least to the extent needed to insert surgical instruments into the uterus and to maneuver them to evacuate the fetus. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 465; App. in No. 05-1382, at 61. The steps taken to cause dilation differ by physician and gestational age of the fetus. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 852, 856, 859, 862-865, 868, 870, 873-874, 876-877, 880, 883, 886. A doctor often begins the dilation process by inserting osmotic dilators, such as laminaria (sticks of seaweed), into the cervix. The dilators can be used in combination with drugs, such as misoprostol, that increase dilation. The resulting amount of dilation is not uniform, and a doctor does not know in advance how an individual patient will respond. In general the longer dilators remain in the cervix, the more it will dilate. Yet the length of time doctors employ osmotic dilators varies. Some may keep dilators in the cervix <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1621</span> for two days, while others use dilators for a day or less. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 464-465; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 961.</p>\n<p>After sufficient dilation the surgical operation can commence. The woman is placed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. The doctor, often guided by ultrasound, inserts grasping forceps through the woman's cervix and into the uterus to grab the fetus. The doctor grips a fetal part with the forceps and pulls it back through the cervix and vagina, continuing to pull even after meeting resistance from the cervix. The friction causes the fetus to tear apart. For example, a leg might be ripped off the fetus as it is pulled through the cervix and out of the woman. The process of evacuating the fetus piece by piece continues until it has been completely removed. A doctor may make 10 to 15 passes with the forceps to evacuate the fetus in its entirety, though sometimes removal is completed with fewer passes. Once the fetus has been evacuated, the placenta and any remaining fetal material are suctioned or scraped out of the uterus. The doctor examines the different parts to ensure the entire fetal body has been removed. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 465; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 962.</p>\n<p>Some doctors, especially later in the second trimester, may kill the fetus a day or two before performing the surgical evacuation. They inject digoxin or potassium chloride into the fetus, the umbilical cord, or the amniotic fluid. Fetal demise may cause contractions and make greater dilation possible. Once dead, moreover, the fetus' body will soften, and its removal will be easier. Other doctors refrain from injecting chemical agents, believing it adds risk with little or no medical benefit. <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 907-912; <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 474-475.</p>\n<p>The abortion procedure that was the impetus for the numerous bans on \"partial-birth abortion,\" including the Act, is a variation of this standard D &amp; E. See M. Haskell, Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion (1992), 1 Appellant's App. in No. 04-3379(CA8), p. 109 (hereinafter Dilation and Extraction). The medical community has not reached unanimity on the appropriate name for this D &amp; E variation. It has been referred to as \"intact D &amp; E,\" \"dilation and extraction\" (D &amp; X), and \"intact D &amp; X.\" <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 440, n. 2; see also F. Cunningham et al., Williams Obstetrics 243 (22d ed.2005) (identifying the procedure as D &amp; X); Danforth's Obstetrics and Gynecology 567 (J. Scott, R. Gibbs, B. Karlan, &amp; A. Haney eds. 9th ed.2003) (identifying the procedure as intact D &amp; X); M. Paul, E. Lichtenberg, L. Borgatta, D. Grimes, &amp; P. Stubblefield, A Clinician's Guide to Medical and Surgical Abortion 136 (1999) (identifying the procedure as intact D &amp; E). For discussion purposes this D &amp; E variation will be referred to as intact D &amp; E. The main difference between the two procedures is that in intact D &amp; E a doctor extracts the fetus intact or largely intact with only a few passes. There are no comprehensive statistics indicating what percentage of all D &amp; Es are performed in this manner.</p>\n<p>Intact D &amp; E, like regular D &amp; E, begins with dilation of the cervix. Sufficient dilation is essential for the procedure. To achieve intact extraction some doctors thus may attempt to dilate the cervix to a greater degree. This approach has been called \"serial\" dilation. <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 856, 870, 873; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 965. Doctors who attempt at the outset to perform intact D &amp; E may dilate for two full days or use up to 25 osmotic dilators. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Dilation and Extraction 110; <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 865, 868, 876, 886.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1622</span> In an intact D &amp; E procedure the doctor extracts the fetus in a way conducive to pulling out its entire body, instead of ripping it apart. One doctor, for example, testified:</p>\n<blockquote>\"If I know I have good dilation and I reach in and the fetus starts to come out and I think I can accomplish it, the abortion with an intact delivery, then I use my forceps a little bit differently. I don't close them quite so much, and I just gently draw the tissue out attempting to have an intact delivery, if possible.\" App. in No. 05-1382, at 74.</blockquote>\n<p>Rotating the fetus as it is being pulled decreases the odds of dismemberment. <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 868-869; App. in No. 05-380, pp. 40-41; 5 Appellant's App. in No. 04-3379(CA8), p. 1469. A doctor also \"may use forceps to grasp a fetal part, pull it down, and re-grasp the fetus at a higher level\u0097sometimes using both his hand and a forceps\u0097to exert traction to retrieve the fetus intact until the head is lodged in the [cervix].\" <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 886-887.</p>\n<p>Intact D &amp; E gained public notoriety when, in 1992, Dr. Martin Haskell gave a presentation describing his method of performing the operation. Dilation and Extraction 110-111. In the usual intact D &amp; E the fetus' head lodges in the cervix, and dilation is insufficient to allow it to pass. See, <i>e.g., ibid.;</i> App. in No. 05-380, at 577; App. in No. 05-1382, at 74, 282. Haskell explained the next step as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`At this point, the right-handed surgeon slides the fingers of the left [hand] along the back of the fetus and \"hooks\" the shoulders of the fetus with the index and ring fingers (palm down).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`While maintaining this tension, lifting the cervix and applying traction to the shoulders with the fingers of the left hand, the surgeon takes a pair of blunt curved Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances the tip, curved down, along the spine and under his middle finger until he feels it contact the base of the skull under the tip of his middle finger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`[T]he surgeon then forces the scissors into the base of the skull or into the foramen magnum. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the scissors to enlarge the opening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents. With the catheter still in place, he applies traction to the fetus, removing it completely from the patient.'\" H.R.Rep. No. 108-58, p. 3 (2003).</blockquote>\n<p>This is an abortion doctor's clinical description. Here is another description from a nurse who witnessed the same method performed on a 26\u00bd-week fetus and who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`Dr. Haskell went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's legs and pulled them down into the birth canal. Then he delivered the baby's body and the arms\u0097everything but the head. The doctor kept the head right inside the uterus. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does when he thinks he is going to fall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby's brains out. Now the baby went completely limp. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`He cut the umbilical cord and delivered the placenta. He threw the baby <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1623</span> in a pan, along with the placenta and the instruments he had just used.'\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Haskell's approach is not the only method of killing the fetus once its head lodges in the cervix, and \"the process has evolved\" since his presentation. <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 965. Another doctor, for example, squeezes the skull after it has been pierced \"so that enough brain tissue exudes to allow the head to pass through.\" App. in No. 05-380, at 41; see also <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 866-867, 874. Still other physicians reach into the cervix with their forceps and crush the fetus' skull. <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 858, 881. Others continue to pull the fetus out of the woman until it disarticulates at the neck, in effect decapitating it. These doctors then grasp the head with forceps, crush it, and remove it. <i>Id.,</i> at 864, 878; see also <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 965.</p>\n<p>Some doctors performing an intact D &amp; E attempt to remove the fetus without collapsing the skull. See <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 866, 869. Yet one doctor would not allow delivery of a live fetus younger than 24 weeks because \"the objective of [his] procedure is to perform an abortion,\" not a birth. App. in No. 05-1382, at 408-409. The doctor thus answered in the affirmative when asked whether he would \"hold the fetus' head on the internal side of the [cervix] in order to collapse the skull\" and kill the fetus before it is born. <i>Id.,</i> at 409; see also <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 862, 878. Another doctor testified he crushes a fetus' skull not only to reduce its size but also to ensure the fetus is dead before it is removed. For the staff to have to deal with a fetus that has \"some viability to it, some movement of limbs,\" according to this doctor, \"[is] always a difficult situation.\" App. in No. 05-380, at 94; see <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 858.</p>\n<p>D &amp; E and intact D &amp; E are not the only second-trimester abortion methods. Doctors also may abort a fetus through medical induction. The doctor medicates the woman to induce labor, and contractions occur to deliver the fetus. Induction, which unlike D &amp; E should occur in a hospital, can last as little as 6 hours but can take longer than 48. It accounts for about five percent of second-trimester abortions before 20 weeks of gestation and 15 percent of those after 20 weeks. Doctors turn to two other methods of second-trimester abortion, hysterotomy and hysterectomy, only in emergency situations because they carry increased risk of complications. In a hysterotomy, as in a cesarean section, the doctor removes the fetus by making an incision through the abdomen and uterine wall to gain access to the uterine cavity. A hysterectomy requires the removal of the entire uterus. These two procedures represent about .07% of second-trimester abortions. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 467; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 962-963.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>After Dr. Haskell's procedure received public attention, with ensuing and increasing public concern, bans on \"`partial birth abortion'\" proliferated. By the time of the <i>Stenberg</i> decision, about 30 States had enacted bans designed to prohibit the procedure. 530 U.S., at 995-996, and nn. 12-13, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); see also H.R.Rep. No. 108-58, at 4-5. In 1996, Congress also acted to ban partial-birth abortion. President Clinton vetoed the congressional legislation, and the Senate failed to override the veto. Congress approved another bill banning the procedure in 1997, but President Clinton again vetoed it. In 2003, after this Court's decision in <i>Stenberg,</i> Congress passed the Act at issue here. H.R.Rep. No. 108-58, at 12-14. On November 5, 2003, President <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1624</span> Bush signed the Act into law. It was to take effect the following day. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>The Act responded to <i>Stenberg</i> in two ways. First, Congress made factual findings. Congress determined that this Court in <i>Stenberg</i> \"was required to accept the very questionable findings issued by the district court judge,\" \u00a7 2(7), 117 Stat. 1202, notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 768, \u00b6 (7) (Congressional Findings), but that Congress was \"not bound to accept the same factual findings,\" <i>ibid.,</i> \u00b6 (8). Congress found, among other things, that \"[a] moral, medical, and ethical consensus exists that the practice of performing a partial-birth abortion . . . is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 767, \u00b6 (1).</p>\n<p>Second, and more relevant here, the Act's language differs from that of the Nebraska statute struck down in <i>Stenberg.</i> See 530 U.S., at 921-922, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (quoting Neb.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 28-328(1), 28-326(9) (Supp.1999)). The operative provisions of the Act provide in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both. This subsection does not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. This subsection takes effect 1 day after the enactment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) As used in this section\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) the term `partial-birth abortion' means an abortion in which the person performing the abortion\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother, for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) performs the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) the term `physician' means a doctor of medicine or osteopathy legally authorized to practice medicine and surgery by the State in which the doctor performs such activity, or any other individual legally authorized by the State to perform abortions: <i>Provided, however,</i> That any individual who is not a physician or not otherwise legally authorized by the State to perform abortions, but who nevertheless directly performs a partial-birth abortion, shall be subject to the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(d)(1) A defendant accused of an offense under this section may seek a hearing before the State Medical Board on whether the physician's conduct was necessary to save the life of the mother whose life was endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) The findings on that issue are admissible on that issue at the trial of the defendant. Upon a motion of the defendant, the court shall delay the beginning <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1625</span> of the trial for not more than 30 days to permit such a hearing to take place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(e) A woman upon whom a partial-birth abortion is performed may not be prosecuted under this section, for a conspiracy to violate this section, or for an offense under section 2, 3, or 4 of this title based on a violation of this section.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</blockquote>\n<p>The Act also includes a provision authorizing civil actions that is not of relevance here. \u00a7 1531(c).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The District Court in <i>Carhart</i> concluded the Act was unconstitutional for two reasons. First, it determined the Act was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception allowing the procedure where necessary for the health of the mother. 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1004-1030. Second, the District Court found the Act deficient because it covered not merely intact D &amp; E but also certain other D &amp; Es. <i>Id.,</i> at 1030-1037.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit addressed only the lack of a health exception. 413 F.3d, at 803-804. The court began its analysis with what it saw as the appropriate question\u0097\"whether `substantial medical authority' supports the medical necessity of the banned procedure.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 796 (quoting <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597). This was the proper framework, according to the Court of Appeals, because \"when a lack of consensus exists in the medical community, the Constitution requires legislatures to err on the side of protecting women's health by including a health exception.\" 413 F.3d, at 796. The court rejected the Attorney General's attempt to demonstrate changed evidentiary circumstances since <i>Stenberg</i> and considered itself bound by <i>Stenberg's</i> conclusion that a health exception was required. 413 F.3d, at 803 (explaining \"[t]he record in [the] case and the record in <i>Stenberg</i> [were] similar in all significant respects\"). It invalidated the Act. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>The District Court in <i>Planned Parenthood</i> concluded the Act was unconstitutional \"because it (1) pose[d] an undue burden on a woman's ability to choose a second trimester abortion; (2)[was] unconstitutionally vague; and (3) require[d] a health exception as set forth by . . . <i>Stenberg.</i>\" 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1034-1035.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed. Like the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, it concluded the absence of a health exception rendered the Act unconstitutional. The court interpreted <i>Stenberg</i> to require a health exception unless \"there is <i>consensus in the medical community</i> that the banned procedure is never medically necessary to preserve the health of women.\" 435 F.3d, at 1173. Even after applying a deferential standard of review to Congress' factual findings, the Court of Appeals determined \"substantial disagreement exists in the medical community regarding whether\" the procedures prohibited by the Act are ever necessary to preserve a woman's health. <i>Id.,</i> at 1175-1176.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals concluded further that the Act placed an undue burden on a woman's ability to obtain a second-trimester abortion. The court found the textual differences between the Act and the Nebraska statute struck down in <i>Stenberg</i> insufficient to distinguish D &amp; E and intact D &amp; E. 435 F.3d, at 1178-1180. As a result, according to the Court of Appeals, the Act imposed an undue burden because it prohibited D &amp; E. <i>Id.,</i> at 1180-1181.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court of Appeals found the Act void for vagueness. <i>Id.,</i> at 1181. Abortion doctors testified they were uncertain <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1626</span> which procedures the Act made criminal. The court thus concluded the Act did not offer physicians clear warning of its regulatory reach. <i>Id.,</i> at 1181-1184. Resting on its understanding of the remedial framework established by this Court in <i>Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.,</i> 546 U.S. 320, 328-330, 126 S.Ct. 961, 163 L.Ed.2d 812 (2006), the Court of Appeals held the Act was unconstitutional on its face and should be permanently enjoined. 435 F.3d, at 1184-1191.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The principles set forth in the joint opinion in <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), did not find support from all those who join the instant opinion. See <i>id.,</i> at 979-1002, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS, J., <i>inter alios,</i> concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Whatever one's views concerning the <i>Casey</i> joint opinion, it is evident a premise central to its conclusion\u0097that the government has a legitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life\u0097would be repudiated were the Court now to affirm the judgments of the Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p><i>Casey</i> involved a challenge to <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). The opinion contains this summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It must be stated at the outset and with clarity that <i>Roe's</i> essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the State's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life or health. And third is the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. These principles do not contradict one another; and we adhere to each.\" 505 U.S., at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court).</blockquote>\n<p>Though all three holdings are implicated in the instant cases, it is the third that requires the most extended discussion; for we must determine whether the Act furthers the legitimate interest of the Government in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child.</p>\n<p>To implement its holding, <i>Casey</i> rejected both <i>Roe's</i> rigid trimester framework and the interpretation of <i>Roe</i> that considered all previability regulations of abortion unwarranted. 505 U.S., at 875-876, 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). On this point <i>Casey</i> overruled the holdings in two cases because they undervalued the State's interest in potential life. See <i>id.,</i> at 881-883, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (joint opinion) (overruling <i>Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U.S. 747, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986) and <i>Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U.S. 416, 103 S.Ct. 2481, 76 L.Ed.2d 687 (1983)).</p>\n<p>We assume the following principles for the purposes of this opinion. Before viability, a State \"may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy.\" 505 U.S., at 879, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). It also may not impose upon this right an undue burden, which exists if a regulation's \"purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1627</span> seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791. On the other hand, \"[r]egulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the State, or the parent or guardian of a minor, may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 877, 112 S.Ct. 2791. <i>Casey,</i> in short, struck a balance. The balance was central to its holding. We now apply its standard to the cases at bar.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We begin with a determination of the Act's operation and effect. A straightforward reading of the Act's text demonstrates its purpose and the scope of its provisions: It regulates and proscribes, with exceptions or qualifications to be discussed, performing the intact D &amp; E procedure.</p>\n<p>Respondents agree the Act encompasses intact D &amp; E, but they contend its additional reach is both unclear and excessive. Respondents assert that, at the least, the Act is void for vagueness because its scope is indefinite. In the alternative, respondents argue the Act's text proscribes all D &amp; Es. Because D &amp; E is the most common second-trimester abortion method, respondents suggest the Act imposes an undue burden. In this litigation the Attorney General does not dispute that the Act would impose an undue burden if it covered standard D &amp; E.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the Act is not void for vagueness, does not impose an undue burden from any overbreadth, and is not invalid on its face.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Act punishes \"knowingly perform[ing]\" a \"partial-birth abortion.\" \u00a7 1531(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). It defines the unlawful abortion in explicit terms. \u00a7 1531(b)(1).</p>\n<p>First, the person performing the abortion must \"vaginally delive[r] a living fetus.\" \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A). The Act does not restrict an abortion procedure involving the delivery of an expired fetus. The Act, furthermore, is inapplicable to abortions that do not involve vaginal delivery (for instance, hysterotomy or hysterectomy). The Act does apply both previability and postviability because, by common understanding and scientific terminology, a fetus is a living organism while within the womb, whether or not it is viable outside the womb. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 971-972. We do not understand this point to be contested by the parties.</p>\n<p>Second, the Act's definition of partial-birth abortion requires the fetus to be delivered \"until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother.\" \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The Attorney General concedes, and we agree, that if an abortion procedure does not involve the delivery of a living fetus to one of these \"anatomical `landmarks'\"\u0097where, depending on the presentation, either the fetal head or the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother\u0097the prohibitions of the Act do not apply. Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-380, p. 46.</p>\n<p>Third, to fall within the Act, a doctor must perform an \"overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus.\" \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(B) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). For purposes of criminal liability, the overt act causing the fetus' death must be separate from delivery. And the overt act must <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1628</span> occur after the delivery to an anatomical landmark. This is because the Act proscribes killing \"the partially delivered\" fetus, which, when read in context, refers to a fetus that has been delivered to an anatomical landmark. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Fourth, the Act contains scienter requirements concerning all the actions involved in the prohibited abortion. To begin with, the physician must have \"deliberately and intentionally\" delivered the fetus to one of the Act's anatomical landmarks. \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A). If a living fetus is delivered past the critical point by accident or inadvertence, the Act is inapplicable. In addition, the fetus must have been delivered \"for the purpose of performing an overt act that the [doctor] knows will kill [it].\" <i>Ibid.</i> If either intent is absent, no crime has occurred. This follows from the general principle that where scienter is required no crime is committed absent the requisite state of mind. See generally 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 5.1 (2d ed.2003) (hereinafter LaFave); 1 C. Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law \u00a7 27 (15th ed.1993).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondents contend the language described above is indeterminate, and they thus argue the Act is unconstitutionally vague on its face. \"As generally stated, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\" <i>Kolender v. Lawson,</i> 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983); <i>Posters `N' Things, Ltd. v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 513, 525, 114 S.Ct. 1747, 128 L.Ed.2d 539 (1994). The Act satisfies both requirements.</p>\n<p>The Act provides doctors \"of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.\" <i>Grayned v. City of Rockford,</i> 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). Indeed, it sets forth \"relatively clear guidelines as to prohibited conduct\" and provides \"objective criteria\" to evaluate whether a doctor has performed a prohibited procedure. <i>Posters `N' Things, supra,</i> at 525-526, 114 S.Ct. 1747. Unlike the statutory language in <i>Stenberg</i> that prohibited the delivery of a \"`substantial portion'\" of the fetus\u0097 where a doctor might question how much of the fetus is a substantial portion\u0097the Act defines the line between potentially criminal conduct on the one hand and lawful abortion on the other. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 922, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (quoting Neb. Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp.1999)). Doctors performing D &amp; E will know that if they do not deliver a living fetus to an anatomical landmark they will not face criminal liability.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is buttressed by the intent that must be proved to impose liability. The Court has made clear that scienter requirements alleviate vagueness concerns. <i>Posters `N' Things, supra,</i> at 526, 114 S.Ct. 1747; see also <i>Colautti v. Franklin,</i> 439 U.S. 379, 395, 99 S.Ct. 675, 58 L.Ed.2d 596 (1979) (\"This Court has long recognized that the constitutionality of a vague statutory standard is closely related to whether that standard incorporates a requirement of <i>mens rea</i>\"). The Act requires the doctor deliberately to have delivered the fetus to an anatomical landmark. \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). Because a doctor performing a D &amp; E will not face criminal liability if he or she delivers a fetus beyond the prohibited point by mistake, the Act cannot be described as \"a trap for those who act in good faith.\" <i>Colautti, supra,</i> at 395, 99 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1629</span> S.Ct. 675 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Respondents likewise have failed to show that the Act should be invalidated on its face because it encourages arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. <i>Kolender, supra,</i> at 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855. Just as the Act's anatomical landmarks provide doctors with objective standards, they also \"establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\" <i>Smith v. Goguen,</i> 415 U.S. 566, 574, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974). The scienter requirements narrow the scope of the Act's prohibition and limit prosecutorial discretion. It cannot be said that the Act \"vests virtually complete discretion in the hands of [law enforcement] to determine whether the [doctor] has satisfied [its provisions].\" <i>Kolender, supra,</i> at 358, 103 S.Ct. 1855 (invalidating a statute regulating loitering). Respondents' arguments concerning arbitrary enforcement, furthermore, are somewhat speculative. This is a preenforcement challenge, where \"no evidence has been, or could be, introduced to indicate whether the [Act] has been enforced in a discriminatory manner or with the aim of inhibiting [constitutionally protected conduct].\" <i>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 489, 503, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). The Act is not vague.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>We next determine whether the Act imposes an undue burden, as a facial matter, because its restrictions on second-trimester abortions are too broad. A review of the statutory text discloses the limits of its reach. The Act prohibits intact D &amp; E; and, notwithstanding respondents' arguments, it does not prohibit the D &amp; E procedure in which the fetus is removed in parts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>The Act prohibits a doctor from intentionally performing an intact D &amp; E. The dual prohibitions of the Act, both of which are necessary for criminal liability, correspond with the steps generally undertaken during this type of procedure. First, a doctor delivers the fetus until its head lodges in the cervix, which is usually past the anatomical landmark for a breech presentation. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). Second, the doctor proceeds to pierce the fetal skull with scissors or crush it with forceps. This step satisfies the overt-act requirement because it kills the fetus and is distinct from delivery. See \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(B). The Act's intent requirements, however, limit its reach to those physicians who carry out the intact D &amp; E after intending to undertake both steps at the outset.</p>\n<p>The Act excludes most D &amp; Es in which the fetus is removed in pieces, not intact. If the doctor intends to remove the fetus in parts from the outset, the doctor will not have the requisite intent to incur criminal liability. A doctor performing a standard D &amp; E procedure can often \"tak[e] about 10-15 `passes' through the uterus to remove the entire fetus.\" <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 962. Removing the fetus in this manner does not violate the Act because the doctor will not have delivered the living fetus to one of the anatomical landmarks or committed an additional overt act that kills the fetus after partial delivery. \u00a7 1531(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>A comparison of the Act with the Nebraska statute struck down in <i>Stenberg</i> confirms this point. The statute in <i>Stenberg</i> prohibited \"`deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1630</span> procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn child.'\" 530 U.S., at 922, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (quoting Neb.Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp.1999)). The Court concluded that this statute encompassed D &amp; E because \"D &amp; E will often involve a physician pulling a `substantial portion' of a still living fetus, say, an arm or leg, into the vagina prior to the death of the fetus.\" 530 U.S., at 939, 120 S.Ct. 2597. The Court also rejected the limiting interpretation urged by Nebraska's Attorney General that the statute's reference to a \"procedure\" that \"`kill[s] the unborn child'\" was to a distinct procedure, not to the abortion procedure as a whole. <i>Id.,</i> at 943, 120 S.Ct. 2597.</p>\n<p>Congress, it is apparent, responded to these concerns because the Act departs in material ways from the statute in <i>Stenberg.</i> It adopts the phrase \"delivers a living fetus,\" \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), instead of \"`delivering . . . a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof,'\" 530 U.S., at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (quoting Neb.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp.1999)). The Act's language, unlike the statute in <i>Stenberg,</i> expresses the usual meaning of \"deliver\" when used in connection with \"fetus,\" namely, extraction of an entire fetus rather than removal of fetal pieces. See Stedman's Medical Dictionary 470 (27th ed.2000) (defining deliver as \"[t]o assist a woman in childbirth\" and \"[t]o extract from an enclosed place, as the fetus from the womb, an object or foreign body\"); see also I. Dox, B. Melloni, G. Eisner, &amp; J. Melloni, The HarperCollins Illustrated Medical Dictionary 160 (4th ed.2001); Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 306 (10th ed.1997). The Act thus displaces the interpretation of \"delivering\" dictated by the Nebraska statute's reference to a \"substantial portion\" of the fetus. <i>Stenberg, supra,</i> at 944, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (indicating that the Nebraska \"statute itself specifies that it applies <i>both</i> to delivering `an intact unborn child' <i>or</i> `a substantial portion thereof'\"). In interpreting statutory texts courts use the ordinary meaning of terms unless context requires a different result. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:28 (rev. 6th ed.2000). Here, unlike in <i>Stenberg,</i> the language does not require a departure from the ordinary meaning. D &amp; E does not involve the delivery of a fetus because it requires the removal of fetal parts that are ripped from the fetus as they are pulled through the cervix.</p>\n<p>The identification of specific anatomical landmarks to which the fetus must be partially delivered also differentiates the Act from the statute at issue in <i>Stenberg.</i> \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The Court in <i>Stenberg</i> interpreted \"`substantial portion'\" of the fetus to include an arm or a leg. 530 U.S., at 939, 120 S.Ct. 2597. The Act's anatomical landmarks, by contrast, clarify that the removal of a small portion of the fetus is not prohibited. The landmarks also require the fetus to be delivered so that it is partially \"outside the body of the mother.\" \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A). To come within the ambit of the Nebraska statute, on the other hand, a substantial portion of the fetus only had to be delivered into the vagina; no part of the fetus had to be outside the body of the mother before a doctor could face criminal sanctions. <i>Id.,</i> at 938-939, 120 S.Ct. 2597.</p>\n<p>By adding an overt-act requirement Congress sought further to meet the Court's objections to the state statute considered in <i>Stenberg.</i> Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) with Neb. Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp.1999). The Act makes the distinction the Nebraska statute failed to draw (but the Nebraska Attorney General advanced) by differentiating between the overall partial-birth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1631</span> abortion and the distinct overt act that kills the fetus. See <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 943-944, 120 S.Ct. 2597. The fatal overt act must occur after delivery to an anatomical landmark, and it must be something \"other than [the] completion of delivery.\" \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(B). This distinction matters because, unlike intact D &amp; E, standard D &amp; E does not involve a delivery followed by a fatal act.</p>\n<p>The canon of constitutional avoidance, finally, extinguishes any lingering doubt as to whether the Act covers the prototypical D &amp; E procedure. \"`[T]he elementary rule is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.'\" <i>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council,</i> 485 U.S. 568, 575, 108 S.Ct. 1392, 99 L.Ed.2d 645 (1988) (quoting <i>Hooper v. California,</i> 155 U.S. 648, 657, 15 S.Ct. 207, 39 L.Ed. 297 (1895)). It is true this longstanding maxim of statutory interpretation has, in the past, fallen by the wayside when the Court confronted a statute regulating abortion. The Court at times employed an antagonistic \"`canon of construction under which in cases involving abortion, a permissible reading of a statute [was] to be avoided at all costs.'\" <i>Stenberg, supra,</i> at 977, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (quoting <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U.S., at 829, 106 S.Ct. 2169 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)). <i>Casey</i> put this novel statutory approach to rest. <i>Stenberg, supra,</i> at 977, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). <i>Stenberg</i> need not be interpreted to have revived it. We read that decision instead to stand for the uncontroversial proposition that the canon of constitutional avoidance does not apply if a statute is not \"genuinely susceptible to two constructions.\" <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 238, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); see also <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U.S. 371, 385, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005). In <i>Stenberg</i> the Court found the statute covered D &amp; E. 530 U.S., at 938-945, 120 S.Ct. 2597. Here, by contrast, interpreting the Act so that it does not prohibit standard D &amp; E is the most reasonable reading and understanding of its terms.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Contrary arguments by the respondents are unavailing. Respondents look to situations that might arise during D &amp; E, situations not examined in <i>Stenberg.</i> They contend\u0097relying on the testimony of numerous abortion doctors\u0097that D &amp; E may result in the delivery of a living fetus beyond the Act's anatomical landmarks in a significant fraction of cases. This is so, respondents say, because doctors cannot predict the amount the cervix will dilate before the abortion procedure. It might dilate to a degree that the fetus will be removed largely intact. To complete the abortion, doctors will commit an overt act that kills the partially delivered fetus. Respondents thus posit that any D &amp; E has the potential to violate the Act, and that a physician will not know beforehand whether the abortion will proceed in a prohibited manner. Brief for Respondent Planned Parenthood et al. in No. 05-1382, p. 38.</p>\n<p>This reasoning, however, does not take account of the Act's intent requirements, which preclude liability from attaching to an accidental intact D &amp; E. If a doctor's intent at the outset is to perform a D &amp; E in which the fetus would not be delivered to either of the Act's anatomical landmarks, but the fetus nonetheless is delivered past one of those points, the requisite and prohibited scienter is not present. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). When a doctor in that situation completes an abortion by performing an intact <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1632</span> D &amp; E, the doctor does not violate the Act. It is true that intent to cause a result may sometimes be inferred if a person \"knows that that result is practically certain to follow from his conduct.\" 1 LaFave \u00a7 5.2(a), at 341. Yet abortion doctors intending at the outset to perform a standard D &amp; E procedure will not know that a prohibited abortion \"is practically certain to follow from\" their conduct. <i>Ibid.</i> A fetus is only delivered largely intact in a small fraction of the overall number of D &amp; E abortions. <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 965.</p>\n<p>The evidence also supports a legislative determination that an intact delivery is almost always a conscious choice rather than a happenstance. Doctors, for example, may remove the fetus in a manner that will increase the chances of an intact delivery. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. in No. 05-1382, at 74, 452. And intact D &amp; E is usually described as involving some manner of serial dilation. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Dilation and Extraction 110. Doctors who do not seek to obtain this serial dilation perform an intact D &amp; E on far fewer occasions. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 857-858 (\"In order for intact removal to occur on a regular basis, Dr. Fitzhugh would have to dilate his patients with a second round of laminaria\"). This evidence belies any claim that a standard D &amp; E cannot be performed without intending or foreseeing an intact D &amp; E.</p>\n<p>Many doctors who testified on behalf of respondents, and who objected to the Act, do not perform an intact D &amp; E by accident. On the contrary, they begin every D &amp; E abortion with the objective of removing the fetus as intact as possible. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 869 (\"Since Dr. Chasen believes that the intact D &amp; E is safer than the dismemberment D &amp; E, Dr. Chasen's goal is to perform an intact D &amp; E every time\"); see also <i>id.,</i> at 873, 886. This does not prove, as respondents suggest, that every D &amp; E might violate the Act and that the Act therefore imposes an undue burden. It demonstrates only that those doctors who intend to perform a D &amp; E that would involve delivery of a living fetus to one of the Act's anatomical landmarks must adjust their conduct to the law by not attempting to deliver the fetus to either of those points. Respondents have not shown that requiring doctors to intend dismemberment before delivery to an anatomical landmark will prohibit the vast majority of D &amp; E abortions. The Act, then, cannot be held invalid on its face on these grounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Under the principles accepted as controlling here, the Act, as we have interpreted it, would be unconstitutional \"if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\" <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). The abortions affected by the Act's regulations take place both previability and postviability; so the quoted language and the undue burden analysis it relies upon are applicable. The question is whether the Act, measured by its text in this facial attack, imposes a substantial obstacle to late-term, but previability, abortions. The Act does not on its face impose a substantial obstacle, and we reject this further facial challenge to its validity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Act's purposes are set forth in recitals preceding its operative provisions. A description of the prohibited abortion procedure demonstrates the rationale for the congressional enactment. The Act proscribes a method of abortion in which a fetus is killed just inches before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1633</span> completion of the birth process. Congress stated as follows: \"Implicitly approving such a brutal and inhumane procedure by choosing not to prohibit it will further coarsen society to the humanity of not only newborns, but all vulnerable and innocent human life, making it increasingly difficult to protect such life.\" Congressional Findings (14)(N), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769. The Act expresses respect for the dignity of human life.</p>\n<p>Congress was concerned, furthermore, with the effects on the medical community and on its reputation caused by the practice of partial-birth abortion. The findings in the Act explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Partial-birth abortion . . . confuses the medical, legal, and ethical duties of physicians to preserve and promote life, as the physician acts directly against the physical life of a child, whom he or she had just delivered, all but the head, out of the womb, in order to end that life.\" Congressional Findings (14)(J), <i>ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There can be no doubt the government \"has an interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession.\" <i>Washington v. Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S. 702, 731, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997); see also <i>Barsky v. Board of Regents of Univ. of N. Y.,</i> 347 U.S. 442, 451, 74 S.Ct. 650, 98 L.Ed. 829 (1954) (indicating the State has \"legitimate concern for maintaining high standards of professional conduct\" in the practice of medicine). Under our precedents it is clear the State has a significant role to play in regulating the medical profession.</p>\n<p><i>Casey</i> reaffirmed these governmental objectives. The government may use its voice and its regulatory authority to show its profound respect for the life within the woman. A central premise of the opinion was that the Court's precedents after <i>Roe</i> had \"undervalue[d] the State's interest in potential life.\" 505 U.S., at 873, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion); see also <i>id.,</i> at 871, 112 S.Ct. 2791. The plurality opinion indicated \"[t]he fact that a law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike at the right itself, has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 874, 112 S.Ct. 2791. This was not an idle assertion. The three premises of <i>Casey</i> must coexist. See <i>id.,</i> at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court). The third premise, that the State, from the inception of the pregnancy, maintains its own regulatory interest in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child, cannot be set at naught by interpreting <i>Casey's</i> requirement of a health exception so it becomes tantamount to allowing a doctor to choose the abortion method he or she might prefer. Where it has a rational basis to act, and it does not impose an undue burden, the State may use its regulatory power to bar certain procedures and substitute others, all in furtherance of its legitimate interests in regulating the medical profession in order to promote respect for life, including life of the unborn.</p>\n<p>The Act's ban on abortions that involve partial delivery of a living fetus furthers the Government's objectives. No one would dispute that, for many, D &amp; E is a procedure itself laden with the power to devalue human life. Congress could nonetheless conclude that the type of abortion proscribed by the Act requires specific regulation because it implicates additional ethical and moral concerns that justify a special prohibition. Congress determined that the abortion methods it proscribed had a \"disturbing similarity to the killing of a newborn infant,\" Congressional Findings (14)(L), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769, and thus it was concerned with \"draw[ing] a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1634</span> bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide.\" Congressional Findings (14)(G), <i>ibid.</i> The Court has in the past confirmed the validity of drawing boundaries to prevent certain practices that extinguish life and are close to actions that are condemned. <i>Glucksberg</i> found reasonable the State's \"fear that permitting assisted suicide will start it down the path to voluntary and perhaps even involuntary euthanasia.\" 521 U.S., at 732-735, and n. 23, 117 S.Ct. 2258.</p>\n<p>Respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in the bond of love the mother has for her child. The Act recognizes this reality as well. Whether to have an abortion requires a difficult and painful moral decision. <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 852-853, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court). While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained. See Brief for Sandra Cano et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> in No. 05-380, pp. 22-24. Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In a decision so fraught with emotional consequence some doctors may prefer not to disclose precise details of the means that will be used, confining themselves to the required statement of risks the procedure entails. From one standpoint this ought not to be surprising. Any number of patients facing imminent surgical procedures would prefer not to hear all details, lest the usual anxiety preceding invasive medical procedures become the more intense. This is likely the case with the abortion procedures here in issue. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 466, n. 22 (\"Most of [the plaintiffs'] experts acknowledged that they do not describe to their patients what [the D &amp; E and intact D &amp; E] procedures entail in clear and precise terms\"); see also <i>id.,</i> at 479.</p>\n<p>It is, however, precisely this lack of information concerning the way in which the fetus will be killed that is of legitimate concern to the State. <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 873, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion) (\"States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning\"). The State has an interest in ensuring so grave a choice is well informed. It is self-evident that a mother who comes to regret her choice to abort must struggle with grief more anguished and sorrow more profound when she learns, only after the event, what she once did not know: that she allowed a doctor to pierce the skull and vacuum the fast-developing brain of her unborn child, a child assuming the human form.</p>\n<p>It is a reasonable inference that a necessary effect of the regulation and the knowledge it conveys will be to encourage some women to carry the infant to full term, thus reducing the absolute number of late-term abortions. The medical profession, furthermore, may find different and less shocking methods to abort the fetus in the second trimester, thereby accommodating legislative demand. The State's interest in respect for life is advanced by the dialogue that better informs the political and legal systems, the medical profession, expectant mothers, and society as a whole of the consequences that follow from a decision to elect a late-term abortion.</p>\n<p>It is objected that the standard D &amp; E is in some respects as brutal, if not more, than the intact D &amp; E, so that the legislation accomplishes little. What we have already said, however, shows ample justification for the regulation. Partial-birth abortion, as defined by the Act, differs from a standard D &amp; E because the former <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1635</span> occurs when the fetus is partially outside the mother to the point of one of the Act's anatomical landmarks. It was reasonable for Congress to think that partial-birth abortion, more than standard D &amp; E, \"undermines the public's perception of the appropriate role of a physician during the delivery process, and perverts a process during which life is brought into the world.\" Congressional Findings (14)(K), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769. There would be a flaw in this Court's logic, and an irony in its jurisprudence, were we first to conclude a ban on both D &amp; E and intact D &amp; E was overbroad and then to say it is irrational to ban only intact D &amp; E because that does not proscribe both procedures. In sum, we reject the contention that the congressional purpose of the Act was \"to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.\" 505 U.S., at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Act's furtherance of legitimate government interests bears upon, but does not resolve, the next question: whether the Act has the effect of imposing an unconstitutional burden on the abortion right because it does not allow use of the barred procedure where \"`necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for [the] preservation of the . . . health of the mother.'\" <i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 327-328, 126 S.Ct. 961 (quoting <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 879, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion)). The prohibition in the Act would be unconstitutional, under precedents we here assume to be controlling, if it \"subject[ed] [women] to significant health risks.\" <i>Ayotte, supra,</i> at 328, 126 S.Ct. 961; see also <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 880, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court). In <i>Ayotte</i> the parties agreed a health exception to the challenged parental-involvement statute was necessary \"to avert serious and often irreversible damage to [a pregnant minor's] health.\" 546 U.S., at 328, 126 S.Ct. 961. Here, by contrast, whether the Act creates significant health risks for women has been a contested factual question. The evidence presented in the trial courts and before Congress demonstrates both sides have medical support for their position.</p>\n<p>Respondents presented evidence that intact D &amp; E may be the safest method of abortion, for reasons similar to those adduced in <i>Stenberg.</i> See 530 U.S., at 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597. Abortion doctors testified, for example, that intact D &amp; E decreases the risk of cervical laceration or uterine perforation because it requires fewer passes into the uterus with surgical instruments and does not require the removal of bony fragments of the dismembered fetus, fragments that may be sharp. Respondents also presented evidence that intact D &amp; E was safer both because it reduces the risks that fetal parts will remain in the uterus and because it takes less time to complete. Respondents, in addition, proffered evidence that intact D &amp; E was safer for women with certain medical conditions or women with fetuses that had certain anomalies. See, <i>e.g., Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-929; <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 470-474; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 982-983.</p>\n<p>These contentions were contradicted by other doctors who testified in the District Courts and before Congress. They concluded that the alleged health advantages were based on speculation without scientific studies to support them. They considered D &amp; E always to be a safe alternative. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 930-940; <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 470-474; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 983.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1636</span> There is documented medical disagreement whether the Act's prohibition would ever impose significant health risks on women. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 1033 (\"[T]here continues to be a division of opinion among highly qualified experts regarding the necessity or safety of intact D &amp; E\"); see also <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 482. The three District Courts that considered the Act's constitutionality appeared to be in some disagreement on this central factual question. The District Court for the District of Nebraska concluded \"the banned procedure is, sometimes, the safest abortion procedure to preserve the health of women.\" <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 1017, 120 S.Ct. 2597. The District Court for the Northern District of California reached a similar conclusion. <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 1002, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (finding intact D &amp; E was \"under certain circumstances . . . significantly safer than D &amp; E by disarticulation\"). The District Court for the Southern District of New York was more skeptical of the purported health benefits of intact D &amp; E. It found the Attorney General's \"expert witnesses reasonably and effectively refuted [the plaintiffs'] proffered bases for the opinion that [intact D &amp; E] has safety advantages over other second-trimester abortion procedures.\" <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 479. In addition it did \"not believe that many of [the plaintiffs'] purported reasons for why [intact D &amp; E] is medically necessary [were] credible; rather [it found them to be] theoretical or false.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 480. The court nonetheless invalidated the Act because it determined \"a significant body of medical opinion . . . holds that D &amp; E has safety advantages over induction and that [intact D &amp; E] has some safety advantages (however hypothetical and unsubstantiated by scientific evidence) over D &amp; E for some women in some circumstances.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The question becomes whether the Act can stand when this medical uncertainty persists. The Court's precedents instruct that the Act can survive this facial attack. The Court has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty. See <i>Kansas v. Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. 346, 360, n. 3, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997); <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 463 U.S. 354, 364-365, n. 13, 370, 103 S.Ct. 3043, 77 L.Ed.2d 694 (1983); <i>Lambert v. Yellowley,</i> 272 U.S. 581, 597, 47 S.Ct. 210, 71 L.Ed. 422 (1926); <i>Collins v. Texas,</i> 223 U.S. 288, 297-298, 32 S.Ct. 286, 56 L.Ed. 439 (1912); <i>Jacobson v. Massachusetts,</i> 197 U.S. 11, 30-31, 25 S.Ct. 358, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905); see also <i>Stenberg, supra,</i> at 969-972, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting); <i>Marshall v. United States,</i> 414 U.S. 417, 427, 94 S.Ct. 700, 38 L.Ed.2d 618 (1974) (\"When Congress undertakes to act in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties, legislative options must be especially broad\").</p>\n<p>This traditional rule is consistent with <i>Casey,</i> which confirms the State's interest in promoting respect for human life at all stages in the pregnancy. Physicians are not entitled to ignore regulations that direct them to use reasonable alternative procedures. The law need not give abortion doctors unfettered choice in the course of their medical practice, nor should it elevate their status above other physicians in the medical community. In <i>Casey</i> the controlling opinion held an informed-consent requirement in the abortion context was \"no different from a requirement that a doctor give certain specific information about any medical procedure.\" 505 U.S., at 884, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (joint opinion). The opinion stated \"the doctor-patient relation here is entitled to the same solicitude it receives in other contexts.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>Webster v. Reproductive Health</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1637</span> <i>Services,</i> 492 U.S. 490, 518-519, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 106 L.Ed.2d 410 (1989) (plurality opinion) (criticizing <i>Roe's</i> trimester framework because, <i>inter alia,</i> it \"left this Court to serve as the country's <i>ex officio</i> medical board with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Mazurek v. Armstrong,</i> 520 U.S. 968, 973, 117 S.Ct. 1865, 138 L.Ed.2d 162 (1997) <i>(per curiam)</i> (upholding a restriction on the performance of abortions to licensed physicians despite the respondents' contention \"all health evidence contradicts the claim that there is any health basis for the law\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Medical uncertainty does not foreclose the exercise of legislative power in the abortion context any more than it does in other contexts. See <i>Hendricks, supra,</i> at 360, n. 3, 117 S.Ct. 2072. The medical uncertainty over whether the Act's prohibition creates significant health risks provides a sufficient basis to conclude in this facial attack that the Act does not impose an undue burden.</p>\n<p>The conclusion that the Act does not impose an undue burden is supported by other considerations. Alternatives are available to the prohibited procedure. As we have noted, the Act does not proscribe D &amp; E. One District Court found D &amp; E to have extremely low rates of medical complications. <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 1000, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Another indicated D &amp; E was \"generally the safest method of abortion during the second trimester.\" <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1031; see also <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 467-468 (explaining that \"[e]xperts testifying for both sides\" agreed D &amp; E was safe). In addition the Act's prohibition only applies to the delivery of \"a living fetus.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). If the intact D &amp; E procedure is truly necessary in some circumstances, it appears likely an injection that kills the fetus is an alternative under the Act that allows the doctor to perform the procedure.</p>\n<p>The instant cases, then, are different from <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428 U.S. 52, 77-79, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976), in which the Court invalidated a ban on saline amniocentesis, the then-dominant second-trimester abortion method. The Court found the ban in <i>Danforth</i> to be \"an unreasonable or arbitrary regulation designed to inhibit, and having the effect of inhibiting, the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 79, 96 S.Ct. 2831. Here the Act allows, among other means, a commonly used and generally accepted method, so it does not construct a substantial obstacle to the abortion right.</p>\n<p>In reaching the conclusion the Act does not require a health exception we reject certain arguments made by the parties on both sides of these cases. On the one hand, the Attorney General urges us to uphold the Act on the basis of the congressional findings alone. Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-380, at 23. Although we review congressional factfinding under a deferential standard, we do not in the circumstances here place dispositive weight on Congress' findings. The Court retains an independent constitutional duty to review factual findings where constitutional rights are at stake. See <i>Crowell v. Benson,</i> 285 U.S. 22, 60, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932) (\"In cases brought to enforce constitutional rights, the judicial power of the United States necessarily extends to the independent determination of all questions, both of fact and law, necessary to the performance of that supreme function\").</p>\n<p>As respondents have noted, and the District Courts recognized, some recitations in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1638</span> the Act are factually incorrect. See <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 482, 488-491. Whether or not accurate at the time, some of the important findings have been superseded. Two examples suffice. Congress determined no medical schools provide instruction on the prohibited procedure. Congressional Findings (14)(B), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769. The testimony in the District Courts, however, demonstrated intact D &amp; E is taught at medical schools. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 490; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1029. Congress also found there existed a medical consensus that the prohibited procedure is never medically necessary. Congressional Findings (1), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 767. The evidence presented in the District Courts contradicts that conclusion. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 1012-1015, 120 S.Ct. 2597; <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 488-489; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 1025-1026. Uncritical deference to Congress' factual findings in these cases is inappropriate.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, relying on the Court's opinion in <i>Stenberg,</i> respondents contend that an abortion regulation must contain a health exception \"if `substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular procedure could endanger women's health.'\" Brief for Respondents in No. 05-380, p. 19 (quoting 530 U.S., at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597); see also Brief for Respondent Planned Parenthood et al. in No. 05-1382, at 12 (same). As illustrated by respondents' arguments and the decisions of the Courts of Appeals, <i>Stenberg</i> has been interpreted to leave no margin of error for legislatures to act in the face of medical uncertainty. <i>Carhart,</i> 413 F.3d, at 796; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 435 F.3d, at 1173; see also <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 437 F.3d, at 296 (Walker, C. J., concurring) (explaining the standard under <i>Stenberg</i> \"is a virtually insurmountable evidentiary hurdle\").</p>\n<p>A zero tolerance policy would strike down legitimate abortion regulations, like the present one, if some part of the medical community were disinclined to follow the proscription. This is too exacting a standard to impose on the legislative power, exercised in this instance under the Commerce Clause, to regulate the medical profession. Considerations of marginal safety, including the balance of risks, are within the legislative competence when the regulation is rational and in pursuit of legitimate ends. When standard medical options are available, mere convenience does not suffice to displace them; and if some procedures have different risks than others, it does not follow that the State is altogether barred from imposing reasonable regulations. The Act is not invalid on its face where there is uncertainty over whether the barred procedure is ever necessary to preserve a woman's health, given the availability of other abortion procedures that are considered to be safe alternatives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>The considerations we have discussed support our further determination that these facial attacks should not have been entertained in the first instance. In these circumstances the proper means to consider exceptions is by as-applied challenge. The Government has acknowledged that preenforcement, as-applied challenges to the Act can be maintained. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-380, pp. 21-23. This is the proper manner to protect the health of the woman if it can be shown that in discrete and well-defined instances a particular condition has or is likely to occur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must be used. In an as-applied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1639</span> challenge the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced than in a facial attack.</p>\n<p>The latitude given facial challenges in the First Amendment context is inapplicable here. Broad challenges of this type impose \"a heavy burden\" upon the parties maintaining the suit. <i>Rust v. Sullivan,</i> 500 U.S. 173, 183, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991). What that burden consists of in the specific context of abortion statutes has been a subject of some question. Compare <i>Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 497 U.S. 502, 514, 110 S.Ct. 2972, 111 L.Ed.2d 405 (1990) (\"[B]ecause appellees are making a facial challenge to a statute, they must show that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid\" (internal quotation marks omitted)), with <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 895, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court) (indicating a spousal-notification statute would impose an undue burden \"in a large fraction of the cases in which [it] is relevant\" and holding the statutory provision facially invalid). See also <i>Janklow v. Planned Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic,</i> 517 U.S. 1174, 116 S.Ct. 1582, 134 L.Ed.2d 679 (1996). We need not resolve that debate.</p>\n<p>As the previous sections of this opinion explain, respondents have not demonstrated that the Act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases. <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 895, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court). We note that the statute here applies to all instances in which the doctor proposes to use the prohibited procedure, not merely those in which the woman suffers from medical complications. It is neither our obligation nor within our traditional institutional role to resolve questions of constitutionality with respect to each potential situation that might develop. \"[I]t would indeed be undesirable for this Court to consider every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of complex and comprehensive legislation.\" <i>United States v. Raines,</i> 362 U.S. 17, 21, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960) (internal quotation marks omitted). For this reason, \"[a]s-applied challenges are the basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication.\" Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L.Rev. 1321, 1328 (2000).</p>\n<p>The Act is open to a proper as-applied challenge in a discrete case. Cf. <i>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 546 U.S. 410, 411-412, 126 S.Ct. 1016, 163 L.Ed.2d 990 (2006) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> No as-applied challenge need be brought if the prohibition in the Act threatens a woman's life because the Act already contains a life exception. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Respondents have not demonstrated that the Act, as a facial matter, is void for vagueness, or that it imposes an undue burden on a woman's right to abortion based on its overbreadth or lack of a health exception. For these reasons the judgments of the Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits are reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice SCALIA joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court's opinion because it accurately applies current jurisprudence, including <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). I write separately to reiterate my view that the Court's abortion jurisprudence, including <i>Casey</i> and <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), has no basis in the Constitution. See <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 979, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (SCALIA, J., <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1640</span> concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <i>Stenberg v.

I also note that whether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court. The parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it. See <i>Cutter v. Wilkinson,</i> 544 U.S. 709, 727, n. 2, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005) (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice SOUTER, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>In <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 844, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), the Court declared that \"[l]iberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt.\" There was, the Court said, an \"imperative\" need to dispel doubt as to \"the meaning and reach\" of the Court's 7-to-2 judgment, rendered nearly two decades earlier in <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). 505 U.S., at 845, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Responsive to that need, the Court endeavored to provide secure guidance to \"[s]tate and federal courts as well as legislatures throughout the Union,\" by defining \"the rights of the woman and the legitimate authority of the State respecting the termination of pregnancies by abortion procedures.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Taking care to speak plainly, the <i>Casey</i> Court restated and reaffirmed <i>Roe's</i> essential holding. 505 U.S., at 845-846, 112 S.Ct. 2791. First, the Court addressed the type of abortion regulation permissible prior to fetal viability. It recognized \"the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Second, the Court acknowledged \"the State's power to restrict abortions <i>after fetal viability,</i> if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life <i>or health.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Third, the Court confirmed that \"the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting <i>the health of the woman</i> and the life of the fetus that may become a child.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>In reaffirming <i>Roe,</i> the <i>Casey</i> Court described the centrality of \"the decision whether to bear . . . a child,\" <i>Eisenstadt v. Baird,</i> 405 U.S. 438, 453, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972), to a woman's \"dignity and autonomy,\" her \"personhood\" and \"destiny,\" her \"conception of . . . her place in society.\" 505 U.S., at 851-852, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Of signal importance here, the <i>Casey</i> Court stated with unmistakable clarity that state regulation of access to abortion procedures, even after viability, must protect \"the health of the woman.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791.</p>\n<p>Seven years ago, in <i>Stenberg v. Carhart,</i> 530 U.S. 914, 120 S.Ct. 2597, 147 L.Ed.2d 743 (2000), the Court invalidated a Nebraska statute criminalizing the performance of a medical procedure that, in the political arena, has been dubbed \"partial-birth abortion.\"<sup>[1]</sup> With fidelity to the <i>Roe-Casey</i> line of precedent, the Court held the Nebraska statute unconstitutional in part because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1641</span> it lacked the requisite protection for the preservation of a woman's health. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 930, 120 S.Ct. 2597; cf. <i>Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.,</i> 546 U.S. 320, 327, 126 S.Ct. 961, 163 L.Ed.2d 812 (2006).</p>\n<p>Today's decision is alarming. It refuses to take <i>Casey</i> and <i>Stenberg</i> seriously. It tolerates, indeed applauds, federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). It blurs the line, firmly drawn in <i>Casey,</i> between previability and postviability abortions. And, for the first time since <i>Roe,</i> the Court blesses a prohibition with no exception safeguarding a woman's health.</p>\n<p>I dissent from the Court's disposition. Retreating from prior rulings that abortion restrictions cannot be imposed absent an exception safeguarding a woman's health, the Court upholds an Act that surely would not survive under the close scrutiny that previously attended state-decreed limitations on a woman's reproductive choices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As <i>Casey</i> comprehended, at stake in cases challenging abortion restrictions is a woman's \"control over her [own] destiny.\" 505 U.S., at 869, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). See also <i>id.,</i> at 852, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (majority opinion).<sup>[2]</sup> \"There was a time, not so long ago,\" when women were \"regarded as the center of home and family life, with attendant special responsibilities that precluded full and independent legal status under the Constitution.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 896-897, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (quoting <i>Hoyt v. Florida,</i> 368 U.S. 57, 62, 82 S.Ct. 159, 7 L.Ed.2d 118 (1961)). Those views, this Court made clear in <i>Casey,</i> \"are no longer consistent with our understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution.\" 505 U.S., at 897, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Women, it is now acknowledged, have the talent, capacity, and right \"to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Their ability to realize their full potential, the Court recognized, is intimately connected to \"their ability to control their reproductive lives.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Thus, legal challenges to undue restrictions on abortion procedures do not seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy; rather, they center on a woman's autonomy to determine her life's course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Siegel, Reasoning from the Body: A Historical Perspective on Abortion Regulation and Questions of Equal Protection, 44 Stan. L.Rev. 261 (1992); Law, Rethinking Sex and the Constitution, 132 U. Pa. L.Rev. 955, 1002-1028 (1984).</p>\n<p>In keeping with this comprehension of the right to reproductive choice, the Court has consistently required that laws regulating abortion, at any stage of pregnancy and in all cases, safeguard a woman's health. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 327-328, 126 S.Ct. 961 (\"[O]ur precedents hold. . . that a State may not restrict access to abortions that are necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for preservation of the life or health of the [woman].\" (quoting <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 879, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion))); <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1642</span> 930, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (\"Since the law requires a health exception in order to validate even a postviability abortion regulation, it at a minimum requires the same in respect to previability regulation.\"). See also <i>Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U.S. 747, 768-769, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986) (invalidating a <i>post</i>-viability abortion regulation for \"fail[ure] to require that [a pregnant woman's] health be the physician's paramount consideration\").</p>\n<p>We have thus ruled that a State must avoid subjecting women to health risks not only where the pregnancy itself creates danger, but also where state regulation forces women to resort to less safe methods of abortion. See <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428 U.S. 52, 79, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976) (holding unconstitutional a ban on a method of abortion that \"force[d] a woman . . . to terminate her pregnancy by methods more dangerous to her health\"). See also <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 931, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (\"[Our cases] make clear that a risk to . . . women's health is the same whether it happens to arise from regulating a particular method of abortion, or from barring abortion entirely.\"). Indeed, we have applied the rule that abortion regulation must safeguard a woman's health to the particular procedure at issue here\u0097intact dilation and evacuation (D &amp; E).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Stenberg,</i> we expressly held that a statute banning intact D &amp; E was unconstitutional in part because it lacked a health exception. 530 U.S., at 930, 937, 120 S.Ct. 2597. We noted that there existed a \"division of medical opinion\" about the relative safety of intact D &amp; E, <i>id.,</i> at 937, 120 S.Ct. 2597, but we made clear that as long as \"substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular abortion procedure could endanger women's health,\" a health exception is required, <i>id.,</i> at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The word `necessary' in <i>Casey's</i> phrase `necessary, in appropriate medical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1643</span> judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the [pregnant woman],' cannot refer to an absolute necessity or to absolute proof. Medical treatments and procedures are often considered appropriate (or inappropriate) in light of estimated comparative health risks (and health benefits) in particular cases. Neither can that phrase require unanimity of medical opinion. Doctors often differ in their estimation of comparative health risks and appropriate treatment. And <i>Casey's</i> words `appropriate medical judgment' must embody the judicial need to tolerate responsible differences of medical opinion. . . .\" <i>Id.,</i> at 937, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, we reasoned, division in medical opinion \"at most means uncertainty, a factor that signals the presence of risk, not its absence.\" <i>Ibid.</i> \"[A] statute that altogether forbids [intact D &amp; E]. . . . consequently must contain a health exception.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597. See also <i>id.,</i> at 948, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"Th[e] lack of a health exception necessarily renders the statute unconstitutional.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In 2003, a few years after our ruling in <i>Stenberg,</i> Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act\u0097without an exception for women's health. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).<sup>[4]</sup> The congressional findings on which the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act rests do not withstand inspection, as the lower courts have determined and this Court is obliged to concede. <i>Ante,</i> at 1637-1638. See <i>National Abortion Federation v. Ashcroft,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d 436, 482 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (\"Congress did not . . . carefully consider the evidence before arriving at its findings.\"), aff'd <i>sub nom. </i><i>National Abortion Federation v.

See <i>ante,</i> at 1637-1638. For example, Congress determined that no medical schools provide instruction on intact D &amp; E. \u00a7 2(14)(B), 117 Stat. 1204, notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769, \u00b6 (14)(B) (Congressional Findings). But in fact, numerous leading medical schools teach the procedure. See <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1029; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 479. See also Brief for ACOG as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 18 (\"Among the schools that now teach the intact variant are Columbia, Cornell, Yale, New York University, Northwestern, University of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1644</span> Pittsburgh, University of Pennsylvania, University of Rochester, and University of Chicago.\").</p>\n<p>More important, Congress claimed there was a medical consensus that the banned procedure is never necessary. Congressional Findings (1), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 767. But the evidence \"very clearly demonstrate[d] the opposite.\" <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1025. See also <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1008-1009 (\"[T]here was no evident consensus in the record that Congress compiled. There was, however, a substantial body of medical opinion presented to Congress in opposition. If anything . . . the congressional record establishes that there was a `consensus' in favor of the banned procedure.\"); <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 488 (\"The congressional record itself undermines [Congress'] finding\" that there is a medical consensus that intact D &amp; E \"is never medically necessary and should be prohibited.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Similarly, Congress found that \"[t]here is no credible medical evidence that partial-birth abortions are safe or are safer than other abortion procedures.\" Congressional Findings (14)(B), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769. But the congressional record includes letters from numerous individual physicians stating that pregnant women's health would be jeopardized under the Act, as well as statements from nine professional associations, including ACOG, the American Public Health Association, and the California Medical Association, attesting that intact D &amp; E carries meaningful safety advantages over other methods. See <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 490. See also <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1021 (\"Congress in its findings . . . chose to disregard the statements by ACOG and other medical organizations.\"). No comparable medical groups supported the ban. In fact, \"all of the government's own witnesses disagreed with many of the specific congressional findings.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1024.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In contrast to Congress, the District Courts made findings after full trials at which all parties had the opportunity to present their best evidence. The courts had the benefit of \"much more extensive medical and scientific evidence . . . concerning the safety and necessity of intact D &amp; Es.\" <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1014; cf. <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 482 (District Court \"heard more evidence during its trial than Congress heard over the span of eight years.\").</p>\n<p>During the District Court trials, \"numerous\" \"extraordinarily accomplished\" and \"very experienced\" medical experts explained that, in certain circumstances and for certain women, intact D &amp; E is safer than alternative procedures and necessary to protect women's health. <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1024-1027; see <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1001 (\"[A]ll of the doctors who actually perform intact D &amp; Es concluded that in their opinion and clinical judgment, intact D &amp; Es remain the safest option for certain individual women under certain individual health circumstances, and are significantly safer for these women than other abortion techniques, and are thus medically necessary.\"); cf. <i>ante,</i> at 1635 (\"Respondents presented evidence that intact D &amp; E may be the safest method of abortion, for reasons similar to those adduced in <i>Stenberg.</i>\").</p>\n<p>According to the expert testimony plaintiffs introduced, the safety advantages of intact D &amp; E are marked for women with certain medical conditions, for example, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1645</span> uterine scarring, bleeding disorders, heart disease, or compromised immune systems. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 924-929, 1026-1027; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 472-473; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 992-994, 1001. Further, plaintiffs' experts testified that intact D &amp; E is significantly safer for women with certain pregnancy-related conditions, such as placenta previa and accreta, and for women carrying fetuses with certain abnormalities, such as severe hydrocephalus. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 924, 1026-1027; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 473-474; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 992-994, 1001. See also <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 929, 120 S.Ct. 2597; Brief for ACOG as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 2, 13-16.</p>\n<p>Intact D &amp; E, plaintiffs' experts explained, provides safety benefits over D &amp; E by dismemberment for several reasons: <i>First,</i> intact D &amp; E minimizes the number of times a physician must insert instruments through the cervix and into the uterus, and thereby reduces the risk of trauma to, and perforation of, the cervix and uterus\u0097the most serious complication associated with nonintact D &amp; E. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-928, 1025; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 471; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 982, 1001. <i>Second,</i> removing the fetus intact, instead of dismembering it <i>in utero,</i> decreases the likelihood that fetal tissue will be retained in the uterus, a condition that can cause infection, hemorrhage, and infertility. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-928, 1025-1026; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 472; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1001. <i>Third,</i> intact D &amp; E diminishes the chances of exposing the patient's tissues to sharp bony fragments sometimes resulting from dismemberment of the fetus. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-928, 1026; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 471; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1001. <i>Fourth,</i> intact D &amp; E takes less operating time than D &amp; E by dismemberment, and thus may reduce bleeding, the risk of infection, and complications relating to anesthesia. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-928, 1026; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 472; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1001. See also <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 928-929, 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597; Brief for ACOG as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 2, 11-13.</p>\n<p>Based on thoroughgoing review of the trial evidence and the congressional record, each of the District Courts to consider the issue rejected Congress' findings as unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1008-1027; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 482, 488-491; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1032. The trial courts concluded, in contrast to Congress' findings, that \"significant medical authority supports the proposition that in some circumstances, [intact D &amp; E] is the safest procedure.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1033 (quoting <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597); accord <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1008-1009, 1017-1018; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 480-482;<sup>[5]</sup> cf. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (\"[T]he record shows that significant medical authority supports the proposition that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1646</span> in some circumstances, [intact D &amp; E] would be the safest procedure.\").</p>\n<p>The District Courts' findings merit this Court's respect. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a); <i>Salve Regina College v. Russell,</i> 499 U.S. 225, 233, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991). Today's opinion supplies no reason to reject those findings. Nevertheless, despite the District Courts' appraisal of the weight of the evidence, and in undisguised conflict with <i>Stenberg,</i> the Court asserts that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act can survive \"when . . . medical uncertainty persists.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1636. This assertion is bewildering. Not only does it defy the Court's longstanding precedent affirming the necessity of a health exception, with no carve-out for circumstances of medical uncertainty, see <i>supra,</i> at 1641-1642; it gives short shrift to the records before us, carefully canvassed by the District Courts. Those records indicate that \"the majority of highly-qualified experts on the subject believe intact D &amp; E to be the safest, most appropriate procedure under certain circumstances.\" <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1034. See <i>supra,</i> at 1644-1645.</p>\n<p>The Court acknowledges some of this evidence, <i>ante,</i> at 1635, but insists that, because some witnesses disagreed with the ACOG and other experts' assessment of risk, the Act can stand. <i>Ante,</i> at 1635-1636, 1638-1639. In this insistence, the Court brushes under the rug the District Courts' well-supported findings that the physicians who testified that intact D &amp; E is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman had slim authority for their opinions. They had no training for, or personal experience with, the intact D &amp; E procedure, and many performed abortions only on rare occasions. See <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 980; <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1025; cf. <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 462-464. Even indulging the assumption that the Government witnesses were equally qualified to evaluate the relative risks of abortion procedures, their testimony could not erase the \"significant medical authority support[ing] the proposition that in some circumstances, [intact D &amp; E] would be the safest procedure.\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Court offers flimsy and transparent justifications for upholding a nationwide <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1647</span> ban on intact D &amp; E <i>sans</i> any exception to safeguard a women's health. Today's ruling, the Court declares, advances \"a premise central to [<i>Casey's</i>] conclusion\"\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> the Government's \"legitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1625-1626. See also <i>ante,</i> at 1626 (\"[W]e must determine whether the Act furthers the legitimate interest of the Government in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child.\"). But the Act scarcely furthers that interest: The law saves not a single fetus from destruction, for it targets only a <i>method</i> of performing abortion. See <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 930, 120 S.Ct. 2597. And surely the statute was not designed to protect the lives or health of pregnant women. <i>Id.,</i> at 951, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (GINSBURG, J., concurring); cf. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (recognizing along with the State's legitimate interest in the life of the fetus, its \"legitimate interes[t]. . . in protecting the <i>health of the woman</i>\" (emphasis added)). In short, the Court upholds a law that, while doing nothing to \"preserv[e] . . . fetal life,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1626, bars a woman from choosing intact D &amp; E although her doctor \"reasonably believes [that procedure] will best protect [her].\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 946, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (STEVENS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>As another reason for upholding the ban, the Court emphasizes that the Act does not proscribe the nonintact D &amp; E procedure. See <i>ante,</i> at 1637. But why not, one might ask. Nonintact D &amp; E could equally be characterized as \"brutal,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1633, involving as it does \"tear[ing] [a fetus] apart\" and \"ripp[ing] off\" its limbs, <i>ante,</i> at 1620-1621, 1621-1622. \"[T]he notion that either of these two equally gruesome procedures . . . is more akin to infanticide than the other, or that the State furthers any legitimate interest by banning one but not the other, is simply irrational.\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 946-947, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (STEVENS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Delivery of an intact, albeit nonviable, fetus warrants special condemnation, the Court maintains, because a fetus that is not dismembered resembles an infant. <i>Ante,</i> at 1633-1634. But so, too, does a fetus delivered intact after it is terminated by injection a day or two before the surgical evacuation, <i>ante,</i> at 1621, 1637-1638, or a fetus delivered through medical induction or cesarean, <i>ante,</i> at 1644. Yet, the availability of those procedures\u0097along with D &amp; E by dismemberment\u0097the Court says, saves the ban on intact D &amp; E from a declaration of unconstitutionality. <i>Ante,</i> at 1637-1638. Never mind that the procedures deemed acceptable might put a woman's health at greater risk. See <i>supra,</i> at 1646, and n. 6; cf. <i>ante,</i> at 1621, 1635-1636.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Court admits that \"moral concerns\" are at work, concerns that could yield prohibitions on any abortion. See <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634 (\"Congress could. . . conclude that the type of abortion proscribed by the Act requires specific regulation because it implicates additional ethical and moral concerns that justify a special prohibition.\"). Notably, the concerns expressed are untethered to any ground genuinely serving the Government's interest in preserving life. By allowing such concerns to carry the day and case, overriding fundamental rights, the Court dishonors our precedent. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 850, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (\"Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.\"); <i>Lawrence v. Texas,</i> 539 U.S. 558, 571, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (Though \"[f]or many persons [objections to homosexual conduct] are not trivial concerns <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1648</span> but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles,\" the power of the State may not be used \"to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law.\" (citing <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 850, 112 S.Ct. 2791)).</p>\n<p>Revealing in this regard, the Court invokes an antiabortion shibboleth for which it concededly has no reliable evidence: Women who have abortions come to regret their choices, and consequently suffer from \"[s]evere depression and loss of esteem.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1634.<sup>[7]</sup> Because of women's fragile emotional state and because of the \"bond of love the mother has for her child,\" the Court worries, doctors may withhold information about the nature of the intact D &amp; E procedure. <i>Ante,</i> at 1633-1634.<sup>[8]</sup> The solution the Court approves, then, is <i>not</i> to require doctors to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1649</span> inform women, accurately and adequately, of the different procedures and their attendant risks. Cf. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 873, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion) (\"States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning.\"). Instead, the Court deprives women of the right to make an autonomous choice, even at the expense of their safety.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>This way of thinking reflects ancient notions about women's place in the family and under the Constitution\u0097ideas that have long since been discredited. Compare, <i>e.g., </i><i>Muller v.

See <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 869-870, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). \"[T]here is no line [more workable] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1650</span> than viability,\" the Court explained in <i>Casey,</i> for viability is \"the time at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing a life outside the womb, so that the independent existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman. . . . In some broad sense it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the State's intervention on behalf of the developing child.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 870, 112 S.Ct. 2791.</p>\n<p>Today, the Court blurs that line, maintaining that \"[t]he Act [legitimately] appl[ies] both previability and postviability because . . . a fetus is a living organism while within the womb, whether or not it is viable outside the womb.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1627. Instead of drawing the line at viability, the Court refers to Congress' purpose to differentiate \"abortion and infanticide\" based not on whether a fetus can survive outside the womb, but on where a fetus is anatomically located when a particular medical procedure is performed. See <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634 (quoting Congressional Findings (14)(G), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769).</p>\n<p>One wonders how long a line that saves no fetus from destruction will hold in face of the Court's \"moral concerns.\" See <i>supra,</i> at 1647; cf. <i>ante,</i> at 1627 (noting that \"[i]n this litigation\" the Attorney General \"does not dispute that the Act would impose an undue burden if it covered standard D &amp; E\"). The Court's hostility to the right <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> secured is not concealed. Throughout, the opinion refers to obstetrician-gynecologists and surgeons who perform abortions not by the titles of their medical specialties, but by the pejorative label \"abortion doctor.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1625, 1631, 1632, 1635, 1636. A fetus is described as an \"unborn child,\" and as a \"baby,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1620, 1622-1623; second-trimester, previability abortions are referred to as \"late-term,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1632; and the reasoned medical judgments of highly trained doctors are dismissed as \"preferences\" motivated by \"mere convenience,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1620, 1638. Instead of the heightened scrutiny we have previously applied, the Court determines that a \"rational\" ground is enough to uphold the Act, <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634, 1638. And, most troubling, <i>Casey's</i> principles, confirming the continuing vitality of \"the essential holding of <i>Roe,</i>\" are merely \"assume[d]\" for the moment, <i>ante,</i> at 1626, 1635, rather than \"retained\" or \"reaffirmed,\" <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Court further confuses our jurisprudence when it declares that \"facial attacks\" are not permissible in \"these circumstances,\" <i>i.e.,</i> where medical uncertainty exists. <i>Ante,</i> at 1638; see <i>ibid.</i> (\"In an as-applied challenge the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced than in a facial attack.\"). This holding is perplexing given that, in materially identical circumstances we held that a statute lacking a health exception was unconstitutional on its face. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 930, 120 S.Ct. 2597; see <i>id.,</i> at 937, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (in facial challenge, law held unconstitutional because \"significant body of medical opinion believes [the] procedure may bring with it greater safety for <i>some patients</i>\" (emphasis added)). See also <i>Sabri v. United States,</i> 541 U.S. 600, 609-610, 124 S.Ct. 1941, 158 L.Ed.2d 891 (2004) (identifying abortion as one setting in which we have recognized the validity of facial challenges); Fallon, Making Sense of Overbreadth, 100 Yale L.J. 853, 859, n. 29 (1991) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1651</span> (\"[V]irtually all of the abortion cases reaching the Supreme Court since <i>Roe v.

But <i>Casey</i> makes clear that, in determining whether any restriction poses an undue burden on a \"large fraction\" of women, the relevant class is <i>not</i> \"all women,\" nor \"all pregnant women,\" nor even all women \"seeking abortions.\" 505 U.S., at 895, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Rather, a provision restricting access to abortion, \"must be judged by reference to those [women] for whom it is an actual rather than an irrelevant restriction,\" <i>ibid.</i> Thus the absence of a health exception burdens <i>all</i> women for whom it is relevant\u0097women who, in the judgment of their doctors, require an intact D &amp; E because other procedures would place their health at risk.<sup>[10]</sup> Cf. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 934, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (accepting the \"relative rarity\" of medically indicated intact D &amp; Es as true but not \"highly relevant\"\u0097for \"the health exception question is whether protecting women's health requires an exception for those infrequent occasions\"); <i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 328, 126 S.Ct. 961 (facial challenge entertained where \"[i]n some very small percentage of cases ... women ... need immediate abortions to avert serious, and often irreversible damage to their health\"). It makes no sense to conclude that this facial challenge fails because respondents have not shown that a health exception is necessary for a large fraction of second-trimester abortions, including those for which a health exception is unnecessary: The very purpose of a health <i>exception</i> is to protect women in <i>exceptional</i> cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>If there is anything at all redemptive to be said of today's opinion, it is that the Court is not willing to foreclose entirely a constitutional challenge to the Act. \"The Act is open,\" the Court states, \"to a proper as-applied challenge in a discrete case.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1639; see <i>ante,</i> at 1639 (\"The Government has acknowledged that preenforcement, as-applied challenges to the Act can be maintained.\"). But the Court offers no clue on what a \"proper\" lawsuit might look like. See <i>ante,</i> at 1638-1639. Nor does the Court explain why the injunctions ordered by the District Courts should not remain in place, trimmed only to exclude instances in which another procedure would safeguard a woman's health at least equally well. Surely the Court cannot mean that no suit may be brought until a woman's health is immediately jeopardized by the ban on intact D &amp; E. A woman \"suffer[ing] from medical complications,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1639, needs access to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1652</span> medical procedure at once and cannot wait for the judicial process to unfold. See <i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 328, 126 S.Ct. 961.</p>\n<p>The Court appears, then, to contemplate another lawsuit by the initiators of the instant actions. In such a second round, the Court suggests, the challengers could succeed upon demonstrating that \"in discrete and well-defined instances a particular condition has or is likely to occur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must be used.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1638. One may anticipate that such a preenforcement challenge will be mounted swiftly, to ward off serious, sometimes irremediable harm, to women whose health would be endangered by the intact D &amp; E prohibition.</p>\n<p>The Court envisions that in an as-applied challenge, \"the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced.\" <i>Ibid.</i> But it should not escape notice that the record already includes hundreds and hundreds of pages of testimony identifying \"discrete and well-defined instances\" in which recourse to an intact D &amp; E would better protect the health of women with particular conditions. See <i>supra,</i> at 1644-1645. Record evidence also documents that medical exigencies, unpredictable in advance, may indicate to a well-trained doctor that intact D &amp; E is the safest procedure. See ibid. In light of this evidence, our unanimous decision just one year ago in <i>Ayotte</i> counsels against reversal. See 546 U.S., at 331, 126 S.Ct. 961 (remanding for reconsideration of the remedy for the absence of a health exception, suggesting that an injunction prohibiting unconstitutional applications might suffice).</p>\n<p>The Court's allowance only of an \"as-applied challenge in a discrete case,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1639\u0097jeopardizes women's health and places doctors in an untenable position. Even if courts were able to carve-out exceptions through piecemeal litigation for \"discrete and well-defined instances,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1638, women whose circumstances have not been anticipated by prior litigation could well be left unprotected. In treating those women, physicians would risk criminal prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment if they exercise their best judgment as to the safest medical procedure for their patients. The Court is thus gravely mistaken to conclude that narrow as-applied challenges are \"the proper manner to protect the health of the woman.\" Cf. <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>As the Court wrote in <i>Casey,</i> \"overruling <i>Roe's</i> central holding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under principles of <i>stare decisis,</i> but would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law.\" 505 U.S., at 865, 112 S.Ct. 2791. \"[T]he very concept of the rule of law underlying our own Constitution requires such continuity over time that a respect for precedent is, by definition, indispensable.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 854, 112 S.Ct. 2791. See also <i>id.,</i> at 867, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (\"[T]o overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to reexamine a watershed decision would subvert the Court's legitimacy beyond any serious question.\").</p>\n<p>Though today's opinion does not go so far as to discard <i>Roe</i> or <i>Casey,</i> the Court, differently composed than it was when we last considered a restrictive abortion regulation, is hardly faithful to our earlier invocations of \"the rule of law\" and the \"principles of <i>stare decisis.</i>\" Congress imposed a ban despite our clear prior holdings that the State cannot proscribe an abortion procedure when its use is necessary to protect a woman's health. See <i>supra,</i> at 1643, n. 4. Although Congress' findings could not withstand the crucible of trial, the Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1653</span> defers to the legislative override of our Constitution-based rulings. See <i>supra,</i> at 1643-1644. A decision so at odds with our jurisprudence should not have staying power.</p>\n<p>In sum, the notion that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act furthers any legitimate governmental interest is, quite simply, irrational. The Court's defense of the statute provides no saving explanation. In candor, the Act, and the Court's defense of it, cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away at a right declared again and again by this Court\u0097 and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women's lives. See <i>supra,</i> at 1641, n. 2; <i>supra,</i> at 1643, n. 4. When \"a statute burdens constitutional rights and all that can be said on its behalf is that it is the vehicle that legislators have chosen for expressing their hostility to those rights, the burden is undue.\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 952, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (quoting <i>Hope Clinic v. Ryan,</i> 195 F.3d 857, 881 (C.A.7 1999) (Posner, C. J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, I dissent from the Court's disposition and would affirm the judgments before us for review.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The term \"partial-birth abortion\" is neither recognized in the medical literature nor used by physicians who perform second-trimester abortions. See <i>Planned Parenthood Federation of Am. v. Ashcroft,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d 957, 964 (N.D.Cal.2004), aff'd, 435 F.3d 1163 (C.A.9 2006). The medical community refers to the procedure as either dilation &amp; extraction (D &amp; X) or intact dilation and evacuation (intact D &amp; E). See, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 1621; <i>Stenberg v. Carhart,</i> 530 U.S. 914, 927, 120 S.Ct. 2597, 147 L.Ed.2d 743 (2000).</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 851-852, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), described more precisely than did <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), the impact of abortion restrictions on women's liberty. <i>Roe's</i> focus was in considerable measure on \"vindicat[ing] the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his professional judgment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 165, 93 S.Ct. 705.</p>\n<p>[3]  Dilation and evacuation (D &amp; E) is the most frequently used abortion procedure during the second trimester of pregnancy; intact D &amp; E is a variant of the D &amp; E procedure. See <i>ante,</i> at 1620-1621, 1621-1622; <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 924, 927, 120 S.Ct. 2597; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 966. Second-trimester abortions (<i>i.e.,</i> midpregnancy, previability abortions) are, however, relatively uncommon. Between 85 and 90 percent of all abortions performed in the United States take place during the first three months of pregnancy. See <i>ante,</i> at 1620. See also <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 923-927, 120 S.Ct. 2597; <i>National Abortion Federation v.

Gonzales,</i> 437 F.3d 278 (C.A.2 2006); <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 960, and n. 4.\n</p>\n<p>Adolescents and indigent women, research suggests, are more likely than other women to have difficulty obtaining an abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy. Minors may be unaware they are pregnant until relatively late in pregnancy, while poor women's financial constraints are an obstacle to timely receipt of services. See Finer, Frohwirth, Dauphinee, Singh, &amp; Moore, Timing of Steps and Reasons for Delays in Obtaining Abortions in the United States, 74 Contraception 334, 341-343 (2006). See also Drey et al., Risk Factors Associated with Presenting for Abortion in the Second Trimester, 107 Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 128, 133 (Jan.2006) (concluding that women who have second-trimester abortions typically discover relatively late that they are pregnant). Severe fetal anomalies and health problems confronting the pregnant woman are also causes of second-trimester abortions; many such conditions cannot be diagnosed or do not develop until the second trimester. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Finer, <i>supra,</i> at 344; F. Cunningham et al., Williams Obstetrics 242, 290, 328-329, (22d ed.2005); cf.

See, <i>e.g.,</i> 149 Cong. Rec. 5731 (2003) (statement of Sen. Santorum) (\"Why are we here? We are here because the Supreme Court defended the indefensible. . . . We have responded to the Supreme Court.\"). See also 148 Cong. Rec. 14273 (2002) (statement of Rep. Linder) (rejecting proposition that Congress has \"no right to legislate a ban on this horrible practice because the Supreme Court says [it] cannot\").</p>\n<p>[5]  Even the District Court for the Southern District of New York, which was more skeptical of the health benefits of intact D &amp; E, see <i>ante,</i> at 1635-1636, recognized: \"[T]he Government's own experts disagreed with almost all of Congress's factual findings\"; a \"significant body of medical opinion\" holds that intact D &amp; E has safety advantages over nonintact D &amp; E; \"[p]rofessional medical associations have also expressed their view that [intact D &amp; E] may be the safest procedure for some women\"; and \"[t]he evidence indicates that the same disagreement among experts found by the Supreme Court in <i>Stenberg</i> existed throughout the time that Congress was considering the legislation, despite Congress's findings to the contrary.\" <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 480-482.</p>\n<p>[6]  The majority contends that \"[i]f the intact D &amp; E procedure is truly necessary in some circumstances, it appears likely an injection that kills the fetus is an alternative under the Act that allows the doctor to perform the procedure.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1637-1638. But a \"significant body of medical opinion believes that inducing fetal death by injection is almost always inappropriate to the preservation of the health of women undergoing abortion because it poses tangible risk and provides no benefit to the woman.\" <i>Carhart v. Ashcroft,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d 805, 1028 (Neb.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), aff'd, 413 F.3d 791 (C.A.8 2005).

The Court also identifies medical induction of labor as an alternative. See <i>ante,</i> at 1644. That procedure, however, requires a hospital stay, <i>ibid.,</i> rendering it inaccessible to patients who lack financial resources, and it too is considered less safe for many women, and impermissible for others. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 940-949, 1017; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 468-470; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 961, n. 5, 992-994, 1000-1002.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Court is surely correct that, for most women, abortion is a painfully difficult decision. See <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634. But \"neither the weight of the scientific evidence to date nor the observable reality of 33 years of legal abortion in the United States comports with the idea that having an abortion is any more dangerous to a woman's long-term mental health than delivering and parenting a child that she did not intend to have. . . .\" Cohen, Abortion and Mental Health: Myths and Realities, 9 Guttmacher Policy Rev. 8 (2006); see generally Bazelon, Is There a Post-Abortion Syndrome?

See <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 891, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (\"[O]n an average day in the United States, nearly 11,000 women are severely assaulted by their male partners.

J. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 320 (Aug. 1996).</p>\n<p>[9]  Eliminating or reducing women's reproductive choices is manifestly <i>not</i> a means of protecting them. When safe abortion procedures cease to be an option, many women seek other means to end unwanted or coerced pregnancies. See, <i>e.g.,</i> World Health Organization, Unsafe Abortion: Global and Regional Estimates of the Incidence of Unsafe Abortion and Associated Mortality in 2000, pp. 3, 16 (4th ed. 2004) (\"Restrictive legislation is associated with a high incidence of unsafe abortion\" worldwide; unsafe abortion represents 13% of all \"maternal\" deaths); Henshaw, Unintended Pregnancy and Abortion: A Public Health Perspective, in A Clinician's Guide to Medical and Surgical Abortion 11, 19 (M.

Perhaps for this reason, in mandating safeguards for women's health, we have never before invoked the \"large fraction\" test.</p>\n\n</div>",

CARHART ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 05\u2013380.      Argued November 8, 2006\u2014Decided April 18, 2007*\nFollowing this Court\u2019s Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U. S. 914, decision that\n  Nebraska\u2019s \u201cpartial birth abortion\u201d statute violated the Federal Con\n  stitution, as interpreted in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.\n  v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, and Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, Congress\n  passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 (Act) to proscribe a\n  particular method of ending fetal life in the later stages of pregnancy.\n  The Act does not regulate the most common abortion procedures used\n  in the first trimester of pregnancy, when the vast majority of abor\n  tions take place. In the usual second-trimester procedure, \u201cdilation\n  and evacuation\u201d (D&E), the doctor dilates the cervix and then inserts\n  surgical instruments into the uterus and maneuvers them to grab the\n  fetus and pull it back through the cervix and vagina. The fetus is\n  usually ripped apart as it is removed, and the doctor may take 10 to\n  15 passes to remove it in its entirety. The procedure that prompted\n  the federal Act and various state statutes, including Nebraska\u2019s, is a\n  variation of the standard D&E, and is herein referred to as \u201cintact\n  D&E.\u201d The main difference between the two procedures is that in in\n  tact D&E a doctor extracts the fetus intact or largely intact with only\n  a few passes, pulling out its entire body instead of ripping it apart.\n  In order to allow the head to pass through the cervix, the doctor typi\n  cally pierces or crushes the skull.\n     The Act responded to Stenberg in two ways. First, Congress found\n  that unlike this Court in Stenberg, it was not required to accept\n  the District Court\u2019s factual findings, and that there was a moral,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 05\u20131382, Gonzales, Attorney General v. Planned\nParenthood Federation of America, Inc., et al., on certiorari to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n2                         GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    medical, and ethical consensus that partial-birth abortion is a grue\n    some and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and\n    should be prohibited. Second, the Act\u2019s language differs from that of\n    the Nebraska statute struck down in Stenberg. Among other things,\n    the Act prohibits \u201cknowingly perform[ing] a partial-birth abortion . . .\n    that is [not] necessary to save the life of a mother,\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n    \u00a71531(a). It defines \u201cpartial-birth abortion,\u201d \u00a71531(b)(1), as a proce\n    dure in which the doctor: \u201c(A) deliberately and intentionally vaginally\n    delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation,\n    the entire fetal head is outside the [mother\u2019s] body . . . , or, in the case\n    of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is\n    outside the [mother\u2019s] body . . . , for the purpose of performing an\n    overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living\n    fetus\u201d; and \u201c(B) performs the overt act, other than completion of de\n    livery, that kills the fetus.\u201d\n       In No. 05\u2013380, respondent abortion doctors challenged the Act\u2019s\n    constitutionality on its face, and the Federal District Court granted a\n    permanent injunction prohibiting petitioner Attorney General from\n    enforcing the Act in all cases but those in which there was no dispute\n    the fetus was viable. The court found the Act unconstitutional be\n    cause it (1) lacked an exception allowing the prohibited procedure\n    where necessary for the mother\u2019s health and (2) covered not merely\n    intact D&E but also other D&Es. Affirming, the Eighth Circuit\n    found that a lack of consensus existed in the medical community as to\n    the banned procedure\u2019s necessity, and thus Stenberg required legisla\n    tures to err on the side of protecting women\u2019s health by including a\n    health exception. In No. 05\u20131382, respondent abortion advocacy\n    groups brought suit challenging the Act. The District Court enjoined\n    the Attorney General from enforcing the Act, concluding it was un\n    constitutional on its face because it (1) unduly burdened a woman\u2019s\n    ability to choose a second-trimester abortion, (2) was too vague, and\n    (3) lacked a health exception as required by Stenberg. The Ninth\n    Circuit agreed and affirmed.\nHeld: Respondents have not demonstrated that the Act, as a facial mat\n ter, is void for vagueness, or that it imposes an undue burden on a\n woman\u2019s right to abortion based on its overbreadth or lack of a health\n exception. Pp. 14\u201339.\n    1. The Casey Court reaffirmed what it termed Roe\u2019s three-part \u201ces\n sential holding\u201d: First, a woman has the right to choose to have an\n abortion before fetal viability and to obtain it without undue interfer\n ence from the State. Second, the State has the power to restrict abor\n tions after viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies\n endangering the woman\u2019s life or health. And third, the State has le\n gitimate interests from the pregnancy\u2019s outset in protecting the\n                   Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nhealth of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a\nchild. 505 U. S., at 846. Though all three are implicated here, it is\nthe third that requires the most extended discussion. In deciding\nwhether the Act furthers the Government\u2019s legitimate interest in pro\ntecting fetal life, the Court assumes, inter alia, that an undue bur\nden on the previability abortion right exists if a regulation\u2019s \u201cpurpose\nor effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the [woman\u2019s] path,\u201d id.,\nat 878, but that \u201c[r]egulations which do no more than create a struc\ntural mechanism by which the State . . . may express profound re\nspect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a sub\nstantial obstacle to the woman\u2019s exercise of the right to choose,\u201d id.,\nat 877. Casey struck a balance that was central to its holding, and\nthe Court applies Casey\u2019s standard here. A central premise of Casey\u2019s\njoint opinion\u2014that the government has a legitimate, substantial in\nterest in preserving and promoting fetal life\u2014would be repudiated\nwere the Court now to affirm the judgments below. Pp. 14\u201316.\n   2. The Act, on its face, is not void for vagueness and does not im\npose an undue burden from any overbreadth. Pp. 16\u201326.\n      (a) The Act\u2019s text demonstrates that it regulates and proscribes\nperforming the intact D&E procedure. First, since the doctor must\n\u201cvaginally delive[r] a living fetus,\u201d \u00a71531(b)(1)(A), the Act does not\nrestrict abortions involving delivery of an expired fetus or those not\ninvolving vaginal delivery, e.g., hysterotomy or hysterectomy. And it\napplies both previability and postviability because, by common un\nderstanding and scientific terminology, a fetus is a living organism\nwithin the womb, whether or not it is viable outside the womb. Sec\nond, because the Act requires the living fetus to be delivered to a spe\ncific anatomical landmark depending on the fetus\u2019 presentation, ibid.,\nan abortion not involving such partial delivery is permitted. Third,\nbecause the doctor must perform an \u201covert act, other than completion\nof delivery, that kills the partially delivered fetus,\u201d \u00a71531(b)(1)(B),\nthe \u201covert act\u201d must be separate from delivery. It must also occur af\nter delivery to an anatomical landmark, since killing \u201cthe partially\ndelivered\u201d fetus, when read in context, refers to a fetus that has been\nso delivered, ibid. Fourth, given the Act\u2019s scienter requirements, de\nlivery of a living fetus past an anatomical landmark by accident or\ninadvertence is not a crime because it is not \u201cdeliberat[e] and inten\ntiona[l], \u00a71531(b)(1)(A). Nor is such a delivery prohibited if the fetus\n[has not] been delivered \u201cfor the purpose of performing an overt act\nthat the [doctor] knows will kill [it].\u201d Ibid. Pp. 16\u201318.\n      (b) The Act is not unconstitutionally vague on its face. It satis\nfies both requirements of the void-for-vagueness doctrine. First, it\nprovides doctors \u201cof ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to\nknow what is prohibited,\u201d Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,\n4                         GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    108, setting forth \u201crelatively clear guidelines as to prohibited con\n    duct\u201d and providing \u201cobjective criteria\u201d to evaluate whether a doctor\n    has performed a prohibited procedure, Posters \u2018N\u2019 Things, Ltd. v.\n    United States, 511 U. S. 513, 525\u2013526. Second, it does not encourage\n    arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. Kolender v. Lawson, 461\n    U. S. 352, 357. Its anatomical landmarks \u201cestablish minimal guide\n    lines to govern law enforcement,\u201d Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566,\n    574, and its scienter requirements narrow the scope of its prohibition\n    and limit prosecutorial discretion, see Kolender, supra, at 358. Re\n    spondents\u2019 arbitrary enforcement arguments, furthermore, are\n    somewhat speculative, since this is a preenforcement challenge.\n    Pp. 18\u201320.\n         (c) The Court rejects respondents\u2019 argument that the Act imposes\n    an undue burden, as a facial matter, because its restrictions on sec\n    ond-trimester abortions are too broad. Pp. 20\u201326.\n            (i) The Act\u2019s text discloses that it prohibits a doctor from inten\n    tionally performing an intact D&E. Its dual prohibitions correspond\n    with the steps generally undertaken in this procedure: The doctor (1)\n    delivers the fetus until its head lodges in the cervix, usually past the\n    anatomical landmark for a breech presentation, see \u00a71531(b)(1)(A),\n    and (2) proceeds to the overt act of piercing or crushing the fetal skull\n    after the partial delivery, see \u00a71531(b)(1)(B). The Act\u2019s scienter re\n    quirements limit its reach to those physicians who carry out the in\n    tact D&E, with the intent to undertake both steps at the outset. The\n    Act excludes most D&Es in which the doctor intends to remove the\n    fetus in pieces from the outset. This interpretation is confirmed by\n    comparing the Act with the Nebraska statute in Stenberg. There, the\n    Court concluded that the statute encompassed D&E, which \u201coften in\n    volve[s] a physician pulling a \u2018substantial portion\u2019 of a still living fe\n    tus . . . , say, an arm or leg, into the vagina prior to the death of the\n    fetus,\u201d 530 U. S., at 939, and rejected the Nebraska Attorney Gen\n    eral\u2019s limiting interpretation that the statute\u2019s reference to a \u201cproce\n    dure\u201d that \u201ckill[s] the unborn child\u201d was to a distinct procedure, not\n    to the abortion procedure as a whole, id., at 943. It is apparent Con\n    gress responded to these concerns because the Act adopts the phrase\n    \u201cdelivers a living fetus,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71531(b)(1)(A), instead of \u201c \u2018deliv\n    ering . . . a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof,\u2019 \u201d 530\n    U. S., at 938, thereby targeting extraction of an entire fetus rather\n    than removal of fetal pieces; identifies specific anatomical landmarks\n    to which the fetus must be partially delivered, \u00a71531(b)(1)(A), thereby\n    clarifying that the removal of a small portion of the fetus is not pro\n    hibited; requires the fetus to be delivered so that it is partially \u201cout\n    side the [mother\u2019s] body,\u201d \u00a71531(b)(1)(A), thereby establishing that\n    delivering a substantial portion of the fetus into the vagina would not\n                   Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsubject a doctor to criminal sanctions; and adds the overt-act re\nquirement, \u00a71531(b)(1), thereby making the distinction the Nebraska\nstatute failed to draw (but the Nebraska Attorney General advanced).\nFinally, the canon of constitutional avoidance, see, e.g., Edward J.\nDeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades\nCouncil, 485 U. S. 568, 575, extinguishes any lingering doubt. Inter\npreting the Act not to prohibit standard D&E is the most reasonable\nreading and understanding of its terms. Pp. 20\u201324.\n       (ii) Respondents\u2019 contrary arguments are unavailing. The con\ntention that any D&E may result in the delivery of a living fetus be\nyond the Act\u2019s anatomical landmarks because doctors cannot predict\nthe amount the cervix will dilate before the procedure does not take\naccount of the Act\u2019s intent requirements, which preclude liability for\nan accidental intact D&E. The evidence supports the legislative de\ntermination that an intact delivery is almost always a conscious\nchoice rather than a happenstance, belying any claim that a standard\nD&E cannot be performed without intending or foreseeing an intact\nD&E. That many doctors begin every D&E with the objective of re\nmoving the fetus as intact as possible based on their belief that this is\nsafer does not prove, as respondents suggest, that every D&E might\nviolate the Act, thereby imposing an undue burden. It demonstrates\nonly that those doctors must adjust their conduct to the law by not\nattempting to deliver the fetus to an anatomical landmark. Respon\ndents have not shown that requiring doctors to intend dismember\nment before such a delivery will prohibit the vast majority of D&E\nabortions. Pp. 24\u201326.\n  3. The Act, measured by its text in this facial attack, does not im\npose a \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d to late-term, but previability, abortions,\nas prohibited by the Casey plurality, 505 U. S., at 878. Pp. 26\u201337.\n     (a) The contention that the Act\u2019s congressional purpose was to\ncreate such an obstacle is rejected. The Act\u2019s stated purposes are\nprotecting innocent human life from a brutal and inhumane proce\ndure and protecting the medical community\u2019s ethics and reputation.\nThe government undoubtedly \u201chas an interest in protecting the in\ntegrity and ethics of the medical profession.\u201d Washington v. Glucks\nberg, 521 U. S. 702, 731. Moreover, Casey reaffirmed that the gov\nernment may use its voice and its regulatory authority to show its\nprofound respect for the life within the woman. See, e.g., 505 U. S.,\nat 873. The Act\u2019s ban on abortions involving partial delivery of a liv\ning fetus furthers the Government\u2019s objectives. Congress determined\nthat such abortions are similar to the killing of a newborn infant.\nThis Court has confirmed the validity of drawing boundaries to pre\nvent practices that extinguish life and are close to actions that are\ncondemned. Glucksberg, supra, at 732\u2013735, and n. 23. The Act also\n6                        GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    recognizes that respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in\n    a mother\u2019s love for her child. Whether to have an abortion requires a\n    difficult and painful moral decision, Casey, 505 U. S., at 852\u2013853,\n    which some women come to regret. In a decision so fraught with\n    emotional consequence, some doctors may prefer not to disclose pre\n    cise details of the abortion procedure to be used. It is, however, pre\n    cisely this lack of information that is of legitimate concern to the\n    State. Id., at 873. The State\u2019s interest in respect for life is advanced\n    by the dialogue that better informs the political and legal systems,\n    the medical profession, expectant mothers, and society as a whole of\n    the consequences that follow from a decision to elect a late-term abor\n    tion. The objection that the Act accomplishes little because the stan\n    dard D&E is in some respects as brutal, if not more, than intact\n    D&E, is unpersuasive. It was reasonable for Congress to think that\n    partial-birth abortion, more than standard D&E, undermines the\n    public\u2019s perception of the doctor\u2019s appropriate role during delivery,\n    and perverts the birth process. Pp. 26\u201330.\n         (b) The Act\u2019s failure to allow the banned procedure\u2019s use where\n    \u201c \u2018necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for preservation of the\n    [mother\u2019s] health,\u2019 \u201d Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New\n    Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 327\u2013328, does not have the effect of imposing an\n    unconstitutional burden on the abortion right. The Court assumes\n    the Act\u2019s prohibition would be unconstitutional, under controlling\n    precedents, if it \u201csubject[ed] [women] to significant health risks.\u201d Id.,\n    at 328. Whether the Act creates such risks was, however, a contested\n    factual question below: The evidence presented in the trial courts and\n    before Congress demonstrates both sides have medical support for\n    their positions. The Court\u2019s precedents instruct that the Act can sur\n    vive facial attack when this medical uncertainty persists. See, e.g.,\n    Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 360, n. 3. This traditional rule is\n    consistent with Casey, which confirms both that the State has an in\n    terest in promoting respect for human life at all stages in the preg\n    nancy, and that abortion doctors should be treated the same as other\n    doctors. Medical uncertainty does not foreclose the exercise of legis\n    lative power in the abortion context any more than it does in other\n    contexts. Other considerations also support the Court\u2019s conclusion,\n    including the fact that safe alternatives to the prohibited procedure,\n    such as D&E, are available. In addition, if intact D&E is truly neces\n    sary in some circumstances, a prior injection to kill the fetus allows a\n    doctor to perform the procedure, given that the Act\u2019s prohibition only\n    applies to the delivery of \u201ca living fetus,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71531(b)(1)(A).\n    Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 77\u201379,\n    distinguished. The Court rejects certain of the parties\u2019 arguments.\n    On the one hand, the Attorney General\u2019s contention that the Act\n                     Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                     7\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  should be upheld based on the congressional findings alone fails be\n  cause some of the Act\u2019s recitations are factually incorrect and some of\n  the important findings have been superseded. Also unavailing, how\n  ever, is respondents\u2019 contention that an abortion regulation must\n  contain a health exception if \u201csubstantial medical authority supports\n  the proposition that banning a particular procedure could endanger\n  women\u2019s health, \u201d Stenberg, 530 U. S., at 938. Interpreting Stenberg\n  as leaving no margin for legislative error in the face of medical uncer\n  tainty is too exacting a standard. Marginal safety considerations, in\n  cluding the balance of risks, are within the legislative competence\n  where, as here, the regulation is rational and pursues legitimate\n  ends, and standard, safe medical options are available. Pp. 31\u201337.\n     4. These facial attacks should not have been entertained in the first\n  instance. In these circumstances the proper means to consider excep\n  tions is by as-applied challenge. Cf. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v.\n  Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 546 U. S. ___, ___. This is the proper man\n  ner to protect the woman\u2019s health if it can be shown that in discrete\n  and well-defined instances a condition has or is likely to occur in\n  which the procedure prohibited by the Act must be used. No as-\n  applied challenge need be brought if the Act\u2019s prohibition threatens a\n  woman\u2019s life, because the Act already contains a life exception. 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a71531(a).

S. 914 (2000), which also addressed the\nsubject of abortion procedures used in the later stages of\npregnancy. Compared to the state statute at issue in\nStenberg, the Act is more specific concerning the instances\n2                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto which it applies and in this respect more precise in its\ncoverage. We conclude the Act should be sustained\nagainst the objections lodged by the broad, facial attack\nbrought against it.\n   In No. 05\u2013380 (Carhart) respondents are LeRoy\nCarhart, William G. Fitzhugh, William H. Knorr, and Jill\nL. Vibhakar, doctors who perform second-trimester abor\ntions. These doctors filed their complaint against the\nAttorney General of the United States in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Nebraska. They\nchallenged the constitutionality of the Act and sought a\npermanent injunction against its enforcement. Carhart v.\nAshcroft, 331 F. Supp. 2d 805 (2004). In 2004, after a 2\nweek trial, the District Court granted a permanent injunc\ntion that prohibited the Attorney General from enforcing\nthe Act in all cases but those in which there was no dis\npute the fetus was viable. Id., at 1048. The Court of\nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 413 F. 3d 791\n(2005). We granted certiorari. 546 U. S. 1169 (2006).\n   In No. 05\u20131382 (Planned Parenthood) respondents are\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., Planned\nParenthood Golden Gate, and the City and County of San\nFrancisco. The Planned Parenthood entities sought to\nenjoin enforcement of the Act in a suit filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of Califor\nnia. Planned Parenthood Federation of Am. v. Ashcroft,\n320 F. Supp. 2d 957 (2004). The City and County of San\nFrancisco intervened as a plaintiff. In 2004, the District\nCourt held a trial spanning a period just short of three\nweeks, and it, too, enjoined the Attorney General from\nenforcing the Act. Id., at 1035. The Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit affirmed. 435 F. 3d 1163 (2006). We\ngranted certiorari. 547 U. S. ___ (2006).\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

Three United\nStates District Courts heard extensive evidence describing\nthe procedures. In addition to the two courts involved in\nthe instant cases the District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York also considered the constitutionality\nof the Act. Nat. Abortion Federation v. Ashcroft, 330\nF. Supp. 2d 436 (2004). It found the Act unconstitutional,\nid., at 493, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\naffirmed, Nat. Abortion Federation v. Gonzales, 437 F. 3d\n278 (2006). The three District Courts relied on similar\nmedical evidence; indeed, much of the evidence submitted\nto the Carhart court previously had been submitted to the\nother two courts. 331 F. Supp. 2d, at 809\u2013810. We refer\nto the District Courts\u2019 exhaustive opinions in our own\ndiscussion of abortion procedures.\n   Abortion methods vary depending to some extent on the\npreferences of the physician and, of course, on the term of\nthe pregnancy and the resulting stage of the unborn\nchild\u2019s development. Between 85 and 90 percent of the\napproximately 1.3 million abortions performed each year\nin the United States take place in the first three months of\npregnancy, which is to say in the first trimester. Planned\nParenthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 960, and n. 4; App. in No.\n05\u20131382, pp. 45\u201348. The most common first-trimester\nabortion method is vacuum aspiration (otherwise known\nas suction curettage) in which the physician vacuums out\nthe embryonic tissue. Early in this trimester an alterna\ntive is to use medication, such as mifepristone (commonly\nknown as RU\u2013486), to terminate the pregnancy. Nat.\nAbortion Federation, supra, at 464, n. 20. The Act does\nnot regulate these procedures.\n   Of the remaining abortions that take place each year,\n4                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmost occur in the second trimester. The surgical proce\ndure referred to as \u201cdilation and evacuation\u201d or \u201cD&E\u201d is\nthe usual abortion method in this trimester. Planned\nParenthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 960\u2013961. Although indi\nvidual techniques for performing D&E differ, the general\nsteps are the same.\n   A doctor must first dilate the cervix at least to the ex\ntent needed to insert surgical instruments into the uterus\nand to maneuver them to evacuate the fetus. Nat. Abor\ntion Federation, supra, at 465; App. in No. 05\u20131382, at 61.\nThe steps taken to cause dilation differ by physician and\ngestational age of the fetus. See, e.g., Carhart, 331\nF. Supp. 2d, at 852, 856, 859, 862\u2013865, 868, 870, 873\u2013874,\n876\u2013877, 880, 883, 886. A doctor often begins the dilation\nprocess by inserting osmotic dilators, such as laminaria\n(sticks of seaweed), into the cervix. The dilators can be\nused in combination with drugs, such as misoprostol, that\nincrease dilation. The resulting amount of dilation is not\nuniform, and a doctor does not know in advance how an\nindividual patient will respond. In general the longer\ndilators remain in the cervix, the more it will dilate. Yet\nthe length of time doctors employ osmotic dilators varies.\nSome may keep dilators in the cervix for two days, while\nothers use dilators for a day or less. Nat. Abortion Federa\ntion, supra, at 464\u2013465; Planned Parenthood, supra, at\n961.\n   After sufficient dilation the surgical operation can com\nmence. The woman is placed under general anesthesia or\nconscious sedation. The doctor, often guided by ultra\nsound, inserts grasping forceps through the woman\u2019s\ncervix and into the uterus to grab the fetus. The doctor\ngrips a fetal part with the forceps and pulls it back\nthrough the cervix and vagina, continuing to pull even\nafter meeting resistance from the cervix. The friction\ncauses the fetus to tear apart. For example, a leg might be\nripped off the fetus as it is pulled through the cervix and\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nout of the woman. The process of evacuating the fetus\npiece by piece continues until it has been completely re\nmoved. A doctor may make 10 to 15 passes with the for\nceps to evacuate the fetus in its entirety, though some\ntimes removal is completed with fewer passes. Once the\nfetus has been evacuated, the placenta and any remaining\nfetal material are suctioned or scraped out of the uterus.\nThe doctor examines the different parts to ensure the\nentire fetal body has been removed. See, e.g., Nat. Abor\ntion Federation, supra, at 465; Planned Parenthood, supra,\nat 962.\n   Some doctors, especially later in the second trimester,\nmay kill the fetus a day or two before performing the\nsurgical evacuation. They inject digoxin or potassium\nchloride into the fetus, the umbilical cord, or the amniotic\nfluid. Fetal demise may cause contractions and make\ngreater dilation possible. Once dead, moreover, the fetus\u2019\nbody will soften, and its removal will be easier. Other\ndoctors refrain from injecting chemical agents, believing it\nadds risk with little or no medical benefit. Carhart, supra,\nat 907\u2013912; Nat. Abortion Federation, supra, at 474\u2013475.\n   The abortion procedure that was the impetus for the\nnumerous bans on \u201cpartial-birth abortion,\u201d including the\nAct, is a variation of this standard D&E. See M. Haskell,\nDilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abor\ntion (1992), 1 Appellant\u2019s App. in No. 04\u20133379 (CA8), p.\n109 (hereinafter Dilation and Extraction). The medical\ncommunity has not reached unanimity on the appropriate\nname for this D&E variation. It has been referred to as\n\u201cintact D&E,\u201d \u201cdilation and extraction\u201d (D&X), and \u201cintact\nD&X.\u201d Nat. Abortion Federation, supra, at 440, n. 2; see\nalso F. Cunningham et al., Williams Obstetrics 243 (22d\ned. 2005) (identifying the procedure as D&X); Danforth\u2019s\nObstetrics and Gynecology 567 (J. Scott, R. Gibbs, B.\nKarlan, & A. Haney eds. 9th ed. 2003) (identifying the\nprocedure as intact D&X); M. Paul, E. Lichtenberg, L.\n6                  GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBorgatta, D. Grimes, & P. Stubblefield, A Clinician\u2019s\nGuide to Medical and Surgical Abortion 136 (1999) (identi\nfying the procedure as intact D&E). For discussion pur\nposes this D&E variation will be referred to as intact\nD&E. The main difference between the two procedures is\nthat in intact D&E a doctor extracts the fetus intact or\nlargely intact with only a few passes. There are no com\nprehensive statistics indicating what percentage of all\nD&Es are performed in this manner.\n  Intact D&E, like regular D&E, begins with dilation of\nthe cervix. Sufficient dilation is essential for the proce\ndure. To achieve intact extraction some doctors thus may\nattempt to dilate the cervix to a greater degree. This\napproach has been called \u201cserial\u201d dilation. Carhart, supra,\nat 856, 870, 873; Planned Parenthood, supra, at 965.\nDoctors who attempt at the outset to perform intact D&E\nmay dilate for two full days or use up to 25 osmotic dila\ntors. See, e.g., Dilation and Extraction 110; Carhart,\nsupra, at 865, 868, 876, 886.\n  In an intact D&E procedure the doctor extracts the fetus\nin a way conducive to pulling out its entire body, instead of\nripping it apart. One doctor, for example, testified:\n      \u201cIf I know I have good dilation and I reach in and\n    the fetus starts to come out and I think I can accom\n    plish it, the abortion with an intact delivery, then I\n    use my forceps a little bit differently. I don\u2019t close\n    them quite so much, and I just gently draw the tissue\n    out attempting to have an intact delivery, if possible.\u201d\n    App. in No. 05\u20131382, at 74.\nRotating the fetus as it is being pulled decreases the odds\nof dismemberment. Carhart, supra, at 868\u2013869; App. in\nNo. 05\u2013380, pp. 40\u201341; 5 Appellant\u2019s App. in No. 04\u20133379\n(CA8), p. 1469. A doctor also \u201cmay use forceps to grasp a\nfetal part, pull it down, and re-grasp the fetus at a higher\nlevel\u2014sometimes using both his hand and a forceps\u2014to\n                  Cite as: 550 U.

Supp. 2d, at 886\u2013\n887.\n   Intact D&E gained public notoriety when, in 1992, Dr.\nMartin Haskell gave a presentation describing his method\nof performing the operation. Dilation and Extraction 110\u2013\n111. In the usual intact D&E the fetus\u2019 head lodges in the\ncervix, and dilation is insufficient to allow it to pass. See,\ne.g., ibid.; App. in No. 05\u2013380, at 577; App. in No. 05\u2013\n1382, at 74, 282. Haskell explained the next step as\nfollows:\n     \u201c \u2018At this point, the right-handed surgeon slides the\n     fingers of the left [hand] along the back of the fetus\n     and \u201chooks\u201d the shoulders of the fetus with the index\n     and ring fingers (palm down).\n      \u201c \u2018While maintaining this tension, lifting the cervix\n     and applying traction to the shoulders with the fin\n     gers of the left hand, the surgeon takes a pair of blunt\n     curved Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand. He\n     carefully advances the tip, curved down, along the\n     spine and under his middle finger until he feels it con\n     tact the base of the skull under the tip of his middle\n     finger.\n     \u201c \u2018[T]he surgeon then forces the scissors into the base\n     of the skull or into the foramen magnum. Having\n     safely entered the skull, he spreads the scissors to\n     enlarge the opening.\n     \u201c \u2018The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a\n     suction catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull\n     contents. With the catheter still in place, he applies\n     traction to the fetus, removing it completely from the\n     patient.\u2019 \u201d H. R. Rep. No. 108\u201358, p. 3 (2003).\n  This is an abortion doctor\u2019s clinical description. Here is\nanother description from a nurse who witnessed the same\nmethod performed on a 26\u00bd-week fetus and who testified\n8                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n      \u201c \u2018Dr. Haskell went in with forceps and grabbed the\n    baby\u2019s legs and pulled them down into the birth canal.\n    Then he delivered the baby\u2019s body and the arms\u2014\n    everything but the head. The doctor kept the head\n    right inside the uterus. . . .\n      \u201c \u2018The baby\u2019s little fingers were clasping and un\n    clasping, and his little feet were kicking. Then the\n    doctor stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and\n    the baby\u2019s arms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like\n    a flinch, like a baby does when he thinks he is going to\n    fall.\n      \u201c \u2018The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-\n    powered suction tube into the opening, and sucked the\n    baby\u2019s brains out. Now the baby went completely\n    limp. . . .\n      \u201c \u2018He cut the umbilical cord and delivered the pla\n    centa. He threw the baby in a pan, along with the\n    placenta and the instruments he had just used.\u2019 \u201d\n    Ibid.\n  Dr. Haskell\u2019s approach is not the only method of killing\nthe fetus once its head lodges in the cervix, and \u201cthe proc\ness has evolved\u201d since his presentation. Planned Parent\nhood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 965. Another doctor, for exam\nple, squeezes the skull after it has been pierced \u201cso that\nenough brain tissue exudes to allow the head to pass\nthrough.\u201d App. in No. 05\u2013380, at 41; see also Carhart,\nsupra, at 866\u2013867, 874. Still other physicians reach into\nthe cervix with their forceps and crush the fetus\u2019 skull.\nCarhart, supra, at 858, 881. Others continue to pull the\nfetus out of the woman until it disarticulates at the neck,\nin effect decapitating it. These doctors then grasp the\nhead with forceps, crush it, and remove it. Id., at 864,\n878; see also Planned Parenthood, supra, at 965.\n  Some doctors performing an intact D&E attempt to\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nremove the fetus without collapsing the skull.            See\nCarhart, supra, at 866, 869. Yet one doctor would not\nallow delivery of a live fetus younger than 24 weeks be\ncause \u201cthe objective of [his] procedure is to perform an\nabortion,\u201d not a birth. App. in No. 05\u20131382, at 408\u2013409.\nThe doctor thus answered in the affirmative when asked\nwhether he would \u201chold the fetus\u2019 head on the internal\nside of the [cervix] in order to collapse the skull\u201d and kill\nthe fetus before it is born. Id., at 409; see also Carhart,\nsupra, at 862, 878. Another doctor testified he crushes a\nfetus\u2019 skull not only to reduce its size but also to ensure\nthe fetus is dead before it is removed. For the staff to have\nto deal with a fetus that has \u201csome viability to it, some\nmovement of limbs,\u201d according to this doctor, \u201c[is] always a\ndifficult situation.\u201d App. in No. 05\u2013380, at 94; see\nCarhart, supra, at 858.\n   D&E and intact D&E are not the only second-trimester\nabortion methods. Doctors also may abort a fetus through\nmedical induction. The doctor medicates the woman to\ninduce labor, and contractions occur to deliver the fetus.\nInduction, which unlike D&E should occur in a hospital,\ncan last as little as 6 hours but can take longer than 48. It\naccounts for about five percent of second-trimester abor\ntions before 20 weeks of gestation and 15 percent of those\nafter 20 weeks. Doctors turn to two other methods of\nsecond-trimester abortion, hysterotomy and hysterectomy,\nonly in emergency situations because they carry increased\nrisk of complications. In a hysterotomy, as in a cesarean\nsection, the doctor removes the fetus by making an inci\nsion through the abdomen and uterine wall to gain access\nto the uterine cavity. A hysterectomy requires the re\nmoval of the entire uterus. These two procedures repre\nsent about .07% of second-trimester abortions. Nat. Abor\ntion Federation, 330 F. Supp. 2d, at 467; Planned\nParenthood, supra, at 962\u2013963.\n10                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                                B\n   After Dr. Haskell\u2019s procedure received public attention,\nwith ensuing and increasing public concern, bans on \u201c \u2018par\ntial birth abortion\u2019 \u201d proliferated. By the time of the Sten\nberg decision, about 30 States had enacted bans designed\nto prohibit the procedure. 530 U. S., at 995\u2013996, and nn.\n12\u201313 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); see also H. R. Rep. No.\n108\u201358, at 4\u20135. In 1996, Congress also acted to ban par\ntial-birth abortion. President Clinton vetoed the congres\nsional legislation, and the Senate failed to override the\nveto. Congress approved another bill banning the proce\ndure in 1997, but President Clinton again vetoed it. In\n2003, after this Court\u2019s decision in Stenberg, Congress\npassed the Act at issue here. H. R. Rep. No. 108\u201358, at\n12\u201314. On November 5, 2003, President Bush signed the\nAct into law. It was to take effect the following day. 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71531(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).\n   The Act responded to Stenberg in two ways. First,\nCongress made factual findings. Congress determined\nthat this Court in Stenberg \u201cwas required to accept the\nvery questionable findings issued by the district court\njudge,\u201d \u00a72(7), 117 Stat. 1202, notes following 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 768, \u00b6(7) (Congressional\nFindings), but that Congress was \u201cnot bound to accept the\nsame factual findings,\u201d ibid., \u00b6(8). Congress found, among\nother things, that \u201c[a] moral, medical, and ethical consen\nsus exists that the practice of performing a partial-birth\nabortion . . . is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that\nis never medically necessary and should be prohibited.\u201d\nId., at 767, \u00b6(1).\n   Second, and more relevant here, the Act\u2019s language\ndiffers from that of the Nebraska statute struck down in\nStenberg. See 530 U. S., at 921\u2013922 (quoting Neb. Rev.\nStat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a728\u2013328(1), 28\u2013326(9) (Supp. 1999)).

First, it determined the\nAct was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception\nallowing the procedure where necessary for the health of\nthe mother. 331 F. Supp. 2d, at 1004\u20131030. Second, the\nDistrict Court found the Act deficient because it covered\nnot merely intact D&E but also certain other D&Es. Id.,\nat 1030\u20131037.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit addressed\nonly the lack of a health exception. 413 F. 3d, at 803\u2013804.\nThe court began its analysis with what it saw as the ap\npropriate question\u2014\u201cwhether \u2018substantial medical author\nity\u2019 supports the medical necessity of the banned proce\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

S., at 938).\nThis was the proper framework, according to the Court of\nAppeals, because \u201cwhen a lack of consensus exists in the\nmedical community, the Constitution requires legislatures\nto err on the side of protecting women\u2019s health by includ\ning a health exception.\u201d 413 F. 3d, at 796. The court\nrejected the Attorney General\u2019s attempt to demonstrate\nchanged evidentiary circumstances since Stenberg and\nconsidered itself bound by Stenberg\u2019s conclusion that a\nhealth exception was required. 413 F. 3d, at 803 (explain\ning \u201c[t]he record in [the] case and the record in Stenberg\n[were] similar in all significant respects\u201d). It invalidated\nthe Act. Ibid.\n                             D\n   The District Court in Planned Parenthood concluded the\nAct was unconstitutional \u201cbecause it (1) pose[d] an undue\nburden on a woman\u2019s ability to choose a second trimester\nabortion; (2) [was] unconstitutionally vague; and (3) re\nquire[d] a health exception as set forth by . . . Stenberg.\u201d\n320 F. Supp. 2d, at 1034\u20131035.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed. Like\nthe Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, it concluded\nthe absence of a health exception rendered the Act uncon\nstitutional. The court interpreted Stenberg to require a\nhealth exception unless \u201cthere is consensus in the medical\ncommunity that the banned procedure is never medically\nnecessary to preserve the health of women.\u201d 435 F. 3d, at\n1173. Even after applying a deferential standard of re\nview to Congress\u2019 factual findings, the Court of Appeals\ndetermined \u201csubstantial disagreement exists in the medi\ncal community regarding whether\u201d the procedures prohib\nited by the Act are ever necessary to preserve a woman\u2019s\nhealth. Id., at 1175\u20131176.\n   The Court of Appeals concluded further that the Act\nplaced an undue burden on a woman\u2019s ability to obtain a\n14                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsecond-trimester abortion. The court found the textual\ndifferences between the Act and the Nebraska statute\nstruck down in Stenberg insufficient to distinguish D&E\nand intact D&E. 435 F. 3d, at 1178\u20131180. As a result,\naccording to the Court of Appeals, the Act imposed an\nundue burden because it prohibited D&E. Id., at 1180\u2013\n1181.\n  Finally, the Court of Appeals found the Act void for\nvagueness. Id., at 1181. Abortion doctors testified they\nwere uncertain which procedures the Act made criminal.\nThe court thus concluded the Act did not offer physicians\nclear warning of its regulatory reach. Id., at 1181\u20131184.\nResting on its understanding of the remedial framework\nestablished by this Court in Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood\nof Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 328\u2013330 (2006), the\nCourt of Appeals held the Act was unconstitutional on its\nface and should be permanently enjoined. 435 F. 3d, at\n1184\u20131191.\n                              II\n   The principles set forth in the joint opinion in Planned\nParenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833\n(1992), did not find support from all those who join the\ninstant opinion. See id., at 979\u20131002 (SCALIA, J., joined\nby THOMAS, J., inter alios, concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part). Whatever one\u2019s views concerning\nthe Casey joint opinion, it is evident a premise central to\nits conclusion\u2014that the government has a legitimate and\nsubstantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal\nlife\u2014would be repudiated were the Court now to affirm\nthe judgments of the Courts of Appeals.\n   Casey involved a challenge to Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113\n(1973). The opinion contains this summary:\n       \u201cIt must be stated at the outset and with clarity\n     that Roe\u2019s essential holding, the holding we reaffirm,\n     has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    the woman to choose to have an abortion before viabil\n    ity and to obtain it without undue interference from\n    the State. Before viability, the State\u2019s interests are\n    not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion\n    or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the\n    woman\u2019s effective right to elect the procedure. Second\n    is a confirmation of the State\u2019s power to restrict abor\n    tions after fetal viability, if the law contains excep\n    tions for pregnancies which endanger the woman\u2019s life\n    or health. And third is the principle that the State\n    has legitimate interests from the outset of the preg\n    nancy in protecting the health of the woman and the\n    life of the fetus that may become a child. These prin\n    ciples do not contradict one another; and we adhere to\n    each.\u201d 505 U. S., at 846 (opinion of the Court).\nThough all three holdings are implicated in the instant\ncases, it is the third that requires the most extended\ndiscussion; for we must determine whether the Act fur\nthers the legitimate interest of the Government in protect\ning the life of the fetus that may become a child.\n   To implement its holding, Casey rejected both Roe\u2019s rigid\ntrimester framework and the interpretation of Roe that\nconsidered all previability regulations of abortion unwar\nranted. 505 U. S., at 875\u2013876, 878 (plurality opinion). On\nthis point Casey overruled the holdings in two cases be\ncause they undervalued the State\u2019s interest in potential\nlife. See id., at 881\u2013883 (joint opinion) (overruling Thorn-\nburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo\ngists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986) and Akron v. Akron Center for\nReproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983)).\n   We assume the following principles for the purposes of\nthis opinion. Before viability, a State \u201cmay not prohibit\nany woman from making the ultimate decision to termi\nnate her pregnancy.\u201d 505 U. S., at 879 (plurality opinion).\nIt also may not impose upon this right an undue burden,\n16                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich exists if a regulation\u2019s \u201cpurpose or effect is to place\na substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an\nabortion before the fetus attains viability.\u201d Id., at 878. On\nthe other hand, \u201c[r]egulations which do no more than\ncreate a structural mechanism by which the State, or the\nparent or guardian of a minor, may express profound\nrespect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are\nnot a substantial obstacle to the woman\u2019s exercise of the\nright to choose.\u201d Id., at 877. Casey, in short, struck a\nbalance. The balance was central to its holding. We now\napply its standard to the cases at bar.\n                            III\n   We begin with a determination of the Act\u2019s operation\nand effect. A straightforward reading of the Act\u2019s text\ndemonstrates its purpose and the scope of its provisions: It\nregulates and proscribes, with exceptions or qualifications\nto be discussed, performing the intact D&E procedure.\n   Respondents agree the Act encompasses intact D&E,\nbut they contend its additional reach is both unclear and\nexcessive. Respondents assert that, at the least, the Act is\nvoid for vagueness because its scope is indefinite. In the\nalternative, respondents argue the Act\u2019s text proscribes all\nD&Es.      Because D&E is the most common second-\ntrimester abortion method, respondents suggest the Act\nimposes an undue burden. In this litigation the Attorney\nGeneral does not dispute that the Act would impose an\nundue burden if it covered standard D&E.\n   We conclude that the Act is not void for vagueness, does\nnot impose an undue burden from any overbreadth, and is\nnot invalid on its face.\n                            A\n  The Act punishes \u201cknowingly perform[ing]\u201d a \u201cpartial\nbirth abortion.\u201d \u00a71531(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). It defines\nthe unlawful abortion in explicit terms. \u00a71531(b)(1).\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  First, the person performing the abortion must \u201cvagi\nnally delive[r] a living fetus.\u201d \u00a71531(b)(1)(A). The Act\ndoes not restrict an abortion procedure involving the\ndelivery of an expired fetus. The Act, furthermore, is\ninapplicable to abortions that do not involve vaginal deliv\nery (for instance, hysterotomy or hysterectomy). The Act\ndoes apply both previability and postviability because, by\ncommon understanding and scientific terminology, a fetus\nis a living organism while within the womb, whether or\nnot it is viable outside the womb. See, e.g., Planned Par\nenthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 971\u2013972. We do not under\nstand this point to be contested by the parties.\n  Second, the Act\u2019s definition of partial-birth abortion\nrequires the fetus to be delivered \u201cuntil, in the case of a\nhead-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the\nbody of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation,\nany part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the\nbody of the mother.\u201d \u00a71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).\nThe Attorney General concedes, and we agree, that if an\nabortion procedure does not involve the delivery of a living\nfetus to one of these \u201canatomical \u2018landmarks\u2019 \u201d\u2014where,\ndepending on the presentation, either the fetal head or the\nfetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the\nmother\u2014the prohibitions of the Act do not apply. Brief for\nPetitioner in No. 05\u2013380, p. 46.\n  Third, to fall within the Act, a doctor must perform an\n\u201covert act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the\npartially delivered living fetus.\u201d \u00a71531(b)(1)(B) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV). For purposes of criminal liability, the overt act\ncausing the fetus\u2019 death must be separate from delivery.\nAnd the overt act must occur after the delivery to an\nanatomical landmark. This is because the Act proscribes\nkilling \u201cthe partially delivered\u201d fetus, which, when read in\ncontext, refers to a fetus that has been delivered to an\nanatomical landmark. Ibid.\n  Fourth, the Act contains scienter requirements concern\n18                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning all the actions involved in the prohibited abortion. To\nbegin with, the physician must have \u201cdeliberately and\nintentionally\u201d delivered the fetus to one of the Act\u2019s ana\ntomical landmarks. \u00a71531(b)(1)(A). If a living fetus is\ndelivered past the critical point by accident or inadver\ntence, the Act is inapplicable. In addition, the fetus must\nhave been delivered \u201cfor the purpose of performing an\novert act that the [doctor] knows will kill [it].\u201d Ibid. If\neither intent is absent, no crime has occurred. This fol\nlows from the general principle that where scienter is\nrequired no crime is committed absent the requisite state\nof mind. See generally 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Crimi\nnal Law \u00a75.1 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter LaFave); 1 C.\nTorcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a727 (15th ed. 1993).\n                              B\n   Respondents contend the language described above is\nindeterminate, and they thus argue the Act is unconstitu\ntionally vague on its face. \u201cAs generally stated, the void-\nfor-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define\nthe criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordi\nnary people can understand what conduct is prohibited\nand in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and\ndiscriminatory enforcement.\u201d Kolender v. Lawson, 461\nU. S. 352, 357 (1983); Posters \u2018N\u2019 Things, Ltd. v. United\nStates, 511 U. S. 513, 525 (1994). The Act satisfies both\nrequirements.\n   The Act provides doctors \u201cof ordinary intelligence a\nreasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.\u201d\nGrayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108 (1972).\nIndeed, it sets forth \u201crelatively clear guidelines as to pro\nhibited conduct\u201d and provides \u201cobjective criteria\u201d to evalu\nate whether a doctor has performed a prohibited proce\ndure. Posters \u2018N\u2019 Things, supra, at 525\u2013526. Unlike the\nstatutory language in Stenberg that prohibited the deliv\nery of a \u201c \u2018substantial portion\u2019 \u201d of the fetus\u2014where a doc\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntor might question how much of the fetus is a substantial\nportion\u2014the Act defines the line between potentially\ncriminal conduct on the one hand and lawful abortion on\nthe other. Stenberg, 530 U. S., at 922 (quoting Neb. Rev.\nStat. Ann. \u00a728\u2013326(9) (Supp. 1999)). Doctors performing\nD&E will know that if they do not deliver a living fetus\nto an anatomical landmark they will not face criminal\nliability.\n   This conclusion is buttressed by the intent that must be\nproved to impose liability. The Court has made clear that\nscienter requirements alleviate vagueness concerns.\nPosters \u2018N\u2019 Things, supra, at 526; see also Colautti v.\nFranklin, 439 U. S. 379, 395 (1979) (\u201cThis Court has long\nrecognized that the constitutionality of a vague statutory\nstandard is closely related to whether that standard in\ncorporates a requirement of mens rea\u201d). The Act requires\nthe doctor deliberately to have delivered the fetus to an\nanatomical landmark. \u00a71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).\nBecause a doctor performing a D&E will not face criminal\nliability if he or she delivers a fetus beyond the prohibited\npoint by mistake, the Act cannot be described as \u201ca trap\nfor those who act in good faith.\u201d Colautti, supra, at 395\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Respondents likewise have failed to show that the Act\nshould be invalidated on its face because it encourages\narbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. Kolender, supra,\nat 357. Just as the Act\u2019s anatomical landmarks provide\ndoctors with objective standards, they also \u201cestablish\nminimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\u201d Smith v.\nGoguen, 415 U. S. 566, 574 (1974). The scienter require\nments narrow the scope of the Act\u2019s prohibition and limit\nprosecutorial discretion. It cannot be said that the Act\n\u201cvests virtually complete discretion in the hands of [law\nenforcement] to determine whether the [doctor] has satis\nfied [its provisions].\u201d Kolender, supra, at 358 (invalidating\na statute regulating loitering). Respondents\u2019 arguments\n20                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconcerning arbitrary enforcement, furthermore, are some\nwhat speculative. This is a preenforcement challenge,\nwhere \u201cno evidence has been, or could be, introduced to\nindicate whether the [Act] has been enforced in a dis\ncriminatory manner or with the aim of inhibiting [consti\ntutionally protected conduct].\u201d Hoffman Estates v. Flip-\nside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 503 (1982). The\nAct is not vague.\n                            C\n  We next determine whether the Act imposes an undue\nburden, as a facial matter, because its restrictions on\nsecond-trimester abortions are too broad. A review of the\nstatutory text discloses the limits of its reach. The Act\nprohibits intact D&E; and, notwithstanding respondents\u2019\narguments, it does not prohibit the D&E procedure in\nwhich the fetus is removed in parts.\n                              1\n  The Act prohibits a doctor from intentionally performing\nan intact D&E. The dual prohibitions of the Act, both of\nwhich are necessary for criminal liability, correspond with\nthe steps generally undertaken during this type of proce\ndure. First, a doctor delivers the fetus until its head\nlodges in the cervix, which is usually past the anatomical\nlandmark for a breech presentation. See 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). Second, the doctor\nproceeds to pierce the fetal skull with scissors or crush it\nwith forceps. This step satisfies the overt-act requirement\nbecause it kills the fetus and is distinct from delivery. See\n\u00a71531(b)(1)(B). The Act\u2019s intent requirements, however,\nlimit its reach to those physicians who carry out the intact\nD&E after intending to undertake both steps at the outset.\n  The Act excludes most D&Es in which the fetus is re\nmoved in pieces, not intact. If the doctor intends to re\nmove the fetus in parts from the outset, the doctor will not\n                  Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhave the requisite intent to incur criminal liability. A\ndoctor performing a standard D&E procedure can often\n\u201ctak[e] about 10\u201315 \u2018passes\u2019 through the uterus to remove\nthe entire fetus.\u201d Planned Parenthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at\n962. Removing the fetus in this manner does not violate\nthe Act because the doctor will not have delivered the\nliving fetus to one of the anatomical landmarks or commit\nted an additional overt act that kills the fetus after partial\ndelivery. \u00a71531(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).\n   A comparison of the Act with the Nebraska statute\nstruck down in Stenberg confirms this point. The statute\nin Stenberg prohibited \u201c \u2018deliberately and intentionally\ndelivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a sub\nstantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a\nprocedure that the person performing such procedure\nknows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn\nchild.\u2019 \u201d 530 U. S., at 922 (quoting Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a728\u2013326(9) (Supp. 1999)). The Court concluded that this\nstatute encompassed D&E because \u201cD&E will often in\nvolve a physician pulling a \u2018substantial portion\u2019 of a still\nliving fetus, say, an arm or leg, into the vagina prior to the\ndeath of the fetus.\u201d 530 U. S., at 939. The Court also\nrejected the limiting interpretation urged by Nebraska\u2019s\nAttorney General that the statute\u2019s reference to a \u201cproce\ndure\u201d that \u201c \u2018kill[s] the unborn child\u2019 \u201d was to a distinct\nprocedure, not to the abortion procedure as a whole. Id.,\nat 943.\n   Congress, it is apparent, responded to these concerns\nbecause the Act departs in material ways from the statute\nin Stenberg. It adopts the phrase \u201cdelivers a living fetus,\u201d\n\u00a71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), instead of \u201c \u2018delivering\n. . . a living unborn child, or a substantial portion\nthereof,\u2019 \u201d 530 U. S., at 938 (quoting Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a728\u2013326(9) (Supp. 1999)). The Act\u2019s language, unlike the\nstatute in Stenberg, expresses the usual meaning of \u201cde\nliver\u201d when used in connection with \u201cfetus,\u201d namely, ex\n22                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntraction of an entire fetus rather than removal of fetal\npieces. See Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary 470 (27th ed.\n2000) (defining deliver as \u201c[t]o assist a woman in child\nbirth\u201d and \u201c[t]o extract from an enclosed place, as the fetus\nfrom the womb, an object or foreign body\u201d); see also I. Dox,\nB. Melloni, G. Eisner, & J. Melloni, The HarperCollins\nIllustrated Medical Dictionary 160 (4th ed. 2001); Mer\nriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 306 (10th ed. 1997).\nThe Act thus displaces the interpretation of \u201cdelivering\u201d\ndictated by the Nebraska statute\u2019s reference to a \u201csubstan\ntial portion\u201d of the fetus. Stenberg, supra, at 944 (indicat\ning that the Nebraska \u201cstatute itself specifies that it ap\nplies both to delivering \u2018an intact unborn child\u2019 or \u2018a\nsubstantial portion thereof\u2019 \u201d). In interpreting statutory\ntexts courts use the ordinary meaning of terms unless\ncontext requires a different result. See, e.g., 2A N. Singer,\nSutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a747:28\n(rev. 6th ed. 2000). Here, unlike in Stenberg, the language\ndoes not require a departure from the ordinary meaning.\nD&E does not involve the delivery of a fetus because it\nrequires the removal of fetal parts that are ripped from\nthe fetus as they are pulled through the cervix.\n   The identification of specific anatomical landmarks to\nwhich the fetus must be partially delivered also differenti\nates the Act from the statute at issue in Stenberg.\n\u00a71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The Court in Stenberg\ninterpreted \u201c \u2018substantial portion\u2019 \u201d of the fetus to include\nan arm or a leg. 530 U. S., at 939. The Act\u2019s anatomical\nlandmarks, by contrast, clarify that the removal of a small\nportion of the fetus is not prohibited. The landmarks also\nrequire the fetus to be delivered so that it is partially\n\u201coutside the body of the mother.\u201d \u00a71531(b)(1)(A). To come\nwithin the ambit of the Nebraska statute, on the other\nhand, a substantial portion of the fetus only had to be\ndelivered into the vagina; no part of the fetus had to be\noutside the body of the mother before a doctor could face\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncriminal sanctions. Id., at 938\u2013939.\n   By adding an overt-act requirement Congress sought\nfurther to meet the Court\u2019s objections to the state statute\nconsidered in Stenberg. Compare 18 U. S. C. \u00a71531(b)(1)\n(2000 ed., Supp. IV) with Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a728\u2013326(9)\n(Supp. 1999). The Act makes the distinction the Nebraska\nstatute failed to draw (but the Nebraska Attorney General\nadvanced) by differentiating between the overall partial-\nbirth abortion and the distinct overt act that kills the\nfetus. See Stenberg, 530 U. S., at 943\u2013944. The fatal\novert act must occur after delivery to an anatomical land\nmark, and it must be something \u201cother than [the] comple\ntion of delivery.\u201d \u00a71531(b)(1)(B). This distinction matters\nbecause, unlike intact D&E, standard D&E does not in\nvolve a delivery followed by a fatal act.\n   The canon of constitutional avoidance, finally, extin\nguishes any lingering doubt as to whether the Act covers\nthe prototypical D&E procedure. \u201c \u2018[T]he elementary rule\nis that every reasonable construction must be resorted to,\nin order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.\u2019 \u201d\nEdward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building\n& Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988) (quot\ning Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895)). It is\ntrue this longstanding maxim of statutory interpretation\nhas, in the past, fallen by the wayside when the Court\nconfronted a statute regulating abortion. The Court at\ntimes employed an antagonistic \u201c \u2018canon of construction\nunder which in cases involving abortion, a permissible\nreading of a statute [was] to be avoided at all costs.\u2019 \u201d\nStenberg, supra, at 977 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (quoting\nThornburgh, 476 U. S., at 829 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting)).\nCasey put this novel statutory approach to rest. Stenberg,\nsupra, at 977 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Stenberg need\nnot be interpreted to have revived it. We read that deci\nsion instead to stand for the uncontroversial proposition\nthat the canon of constitutional avoidance does not apply\n24                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nif a statute is not \u201cgenuinely susceptible to two construc\ntions.\u201d Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224,\n238 (1998); see also Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 385\n(2005). In Stenberg the Court found the statute covered\nD&E. 530 U. S., at 938\u2013945. Here, by contrast, interpret\ning the Act so that it does not prohibit standard D&E is\nthe most reasonable reading and understanding of its\nterms.\n                              2\n  Contrary arguments by the respondents are unavailing.\nRespondents look to situations that might arise during\nD&E, situations not examined in Stenberg. They con\ntend\u2014relying on the testimony of numerous abortion\ndoctors\u2014that D&E may result in the delivery of a living\nfetus beyond the Act\u2019s anatomical landmarks in a signifi\ncant fraction of cases. This is so, respondents say, because\ndoctors cannot predict the amount the cervix will dilate\nbefore the abortion procedure. It might dilate to a degree\nthat the fetus will be removed largely intact. To complete\nthe abortion, doctors will commit an overt act that kills\nthe partially delivered fetus. Respondents thus posit that\nany D&E has the potential to violate the Act, and that a\nphysician will not know beforehand whether the abortion\nwill proceed in a prohibited manner. Brief for Respondent\nPlanned Parenthood et al. in No. 05\u20131382, p. 38.\n  This reasoning, however, does not take account of the\nAct\u2019s intent requirements, which preclude liability from\nattaching to an accidental intact D&E. If a doctor\u2019s intent\nat the outset is to perform a D&E in which the fetus would\nnot be delivered to either of the Act\u2019s anatomical land\nmarks, but the fetus nonetheless is delivered past one of\nthose points, the requisite and prohibited scienter is not\npresent. 18 U. S. C. \u00a71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).\nWhen a doctor in that situation completes an abortion by\nperforming an intact D&E, the doctor does not violate the\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)          25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAct. It is true that intent to cause a result may sometimes\nbe inferred if a person \u201cknows that that result is practi\ncally certain to follow from his conduct.\u201d 1 LaFave \u00a75.2(a),\nat 341. Yet abortion doctors intending at the outset to\nperform a standard D&E procedure will not know that a\nprohibited abortion \u201cis practically certain to follow from\u201d\ntheir conduct. Ibid. A fetus is only delivered largely\nintact in a small fraction of the overall number of D&E\nabortions. Planned Parenthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 965.\n   The evidence also supports a legislative determination\nthat an intact delivery is almost always a conscious choice\nrather than a happenstance. Doctors, for example, may\nremove the fetus in a manner that will increase the\nchances of an intact delivery. See, e.g., App. in No. 05\u2013\n1382, at 74, 452. And intact D&E is usually described as\ninvolving some manner of serial dilation. See, e.g., Dila\ntion and Extraction 110. Doctors who do not seek to ob\ntain this serial dilation perform an intact D&E on far\nfewer occasions. See, e.g., Carhart, 331 F. Supp. 2d, at\n857\u2013858 (\u201cIn order for intact removal to occur on a regular\nbasis, Dr. Fitzhugh would have to dilate his patients with\na second round of laminaria\u201d). This evidence belies any\nclaim that a standard D&E cannot be performed without\nintending or foreseeing an intact D&E.\n   Many doctors who testified on behalf of respondents,\nand who objected to the Act, do not perform an intact D&E\nby accident. On the contrary, they begin every D&E abor\ntion with the objective of removing the fetus as intact as\npossible. See, e.g., id., at 869 (\u201cSince Dr. Chasen believes\nthat the intact D & E is safer than the dismemberment D\n& E, Dr. Chasen\u2019s goal is to perform an intact D & E every\ntime\u201d); see also id., at 873, 886. This does not prove, as\nrespondents suggest, that every D&E might violate the\nAct and that the Act therefore imposes an undue burden.\nIt demonstrates only that those doctors who intend to\nperform a D&E that would involve delivery of a living\n26                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfetus to one of the Act\u2019s anatomical landmarks must adjust\ntheir conduct to the law by not attempting to deliver the\nfetus to either of those points. Respondents have not\nshown that requiring doctors to intend dismemberment\nbefore delivery to an anatomical landmark will prohibit\nthe vast majority of D&E abortions. The Act, then, cannot\nbe held invalid on its face on these grounds.\n                                IV\n   Under the principles accepted as controlling here, the\nAct, as we have interpreted it, would be unconstitutional\n\u201cif its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in\nthe path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus\nattains viability.\u201d Casey, 505 U. S., at 878 (plurality opin\nion). The abortions affected by the Act\u2019s regulations take\nplace both previability and postviability; so the quoted\nlanguage and the undue burden analysis it relies upon are\napplicable. The question is whether the Act, measured by\nits text in this facial attack, imposes a substantial obstacle\nto late-term, but previability, abortions. The Act does not\non its face impose a substantial obstacle, and we reject\nthis further facial challenge to its validity.\n                             A\n   The Act\u2019s purposes are set forth in recitals preceding its\noperative provisions. A description of the prohibited abor\ntion procedure demonstrates the rationale for the congres\nsional enactment. The Act proscribes a method of abortion\nin which a fetus is killed just inches before completion of\nthe birth process. Congress stated as follows: \u201cImplicitly\napproving such a brutal and inhumane procedure by\nchoosing not to prohibit it will further coarsen society to\nthe humanity of not only newborns, but all vulnerable and\ninnocent human life, making it increasingly difficult to\nprotect such life.\u201d Congressional Findings (14)(N), in\nnotes following 18 U. S. C. \u00a71531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p.\n                  Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n769. The Act expresses respect for the dignity of human\nlife.\n   Congress was concerned, furthermore, with the effects\non the medical community and on its reputation caused by\nthe practice of partial-birth abortion. The findings in the\nAct explain:\n    \u201cPartial-birth abortion . . . confuses the medical, legal,\n    and ethical duties of physicians to preserve and pro\n    mote life, as the physician acts directly against the\n    physical life of a child, whom he or she had just deliv\n    ered, all but the head, out of the womb, in order to end\n    that life.\u201d Congressional Findings (14)(J), ibid.\nThere can be no doubt the government \u201chas an interest in\nprotecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profes\nsion.\u201d Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 731\n(1997); see also Barsky v. Board of Regents of Univ. of N.\nY., 347 U. S. 442, 451 (1954) (indicating the State has\n\u201clegitimate concern for maintaining high standards of\nprofessional conduct\u201d in the practice of medicine). Under\nour precedents it is clear the State has a significant role to\nplay in regulating the medical profession.\n   Casey reaffirmed these governmental objectives. The\ngovernment may use its voice and its regulatory authority\nto show its profound respect for the life within the woman.\nA central premise of the opinion was that the Court\u2019s\nprecedents after Roe had \u201cundervalue[d] the State\u2019s inter\nest in potential life.\u201d 505 U. S., at 873 (plurality opinion);\nsee also id., at 871. The plurality opinion indicated \u201c[t]he\nfact that a law which serves a valid purpose, one not\ndesigned to strike at the right itself, has the incidental\neffect of making it more difficult or more expensive to\nprocure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it.\u201d\nId., at 874. This was not an idle assertion. The three\npremises of Casey must coexist. See id., at 846 (opinion of\nthe Court). The third premise, that the State, from the\n28                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninception of the pregnancy, maintains its own regulatory\ninterest in protecting the life of the fetus that may become\na child, cannot be set at naught by interpreting Casey\u2019s\nrequirement of a health exception so it becomes tanta\nmount to allowing a doctor to choose the abortion method\nhe or she might prefer. Where it has a rational basis to\nact, and it does not impose an undue burden, the State\nmay use its regulatory power to bar certain procedures\nand substitute others, all in furtherance of its legitimate\ninterests in regulating the medical profession in order to\npromote respect for life, including life of the unborn.\n   The Act\u2019s ban on abortions that involve partial delivery\nof a living fetus furthers the Government\u2019s objectives. No\none would dispute that, for many, D&E is a procedure\nitself laden with the power to devalue human life. Con\ngress could nonetheless conclude that the type of abortion\nproscribed by the Act requires specific regulation because\nit implicates additional ethical and moral concerns that\njustify a special prohibition. Congress determined that\nthe abortion methods it proscribed had a \u201cdisturbing\nsimilarity to the killing of a newborn infant,\u201d Congres\nsional Findings (14)(L), in notes following 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769, and thus it was con\ncerned with \u201cdraw[ing] a bright line that clearly distin\nguishes abortion and infanticide.\u201d Congressional Findings\n(14)(G), ibid. The Court has in the past confirmed the\nvalidity of drawing boundaries to prevent certain practices\nthat extinguish life and are close to actions that are con\ndemned. Glucksberg found reasonable the State\u2019s \u201cfear\nthat permitting assisted suicide will start it down the path\nto voluntary and perhaps even involuntary euthanasia.\u201d\n521 U. S., at 732\u2013735, and n. 23.\n   Respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in\nthe bond of love the mother has for her child. The Act\nrecognizes this reality as well. Whether to have an abor\ntion requires a difficult and painful moral decision. Casey,\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           29\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupra, at 852\u2013853 (opinion of the Court). While we find no\nreliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unex\nceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their\nchoice to abort the infant life they once created and sus\ntained. See Brief for Sandra Cano et al. as Amici Curiae\nin No. 05\u2013380, pp. 22\u201324. Severe depression and loss of\nesteem can follow. See ibid.\n  In a decision so fraught with emotional consequence\nsome doctors may prefer not to disclose precise details of\nthe means that will be used, confining themselves to the\nrequired statement of risks the procedure entails. From\none standpoint this ought not to be surprising. Any num\nber of patients facing imminent surgical procedures would\nprefer not to hear all details, lest the usual anxiety preced\ning invasive medical procedures become the more intense.\nThis is likely the case with the abortion procedures here in\nissue. See, e.g., Nat. Abortion Federation, 330 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 466, n. 22 (\u201cMost of [the plaintiffs\u2019] experts acknowl\nedged that they do not describe to their patients what [the\nD&E and intact D&E] procedures entail in clear and\nprecise terms\u201d); see also id., at 479.\n  It is, however, precisely this lack of information concern\ning the way in which the fetus will be killed that is of\nlegitimate concern to the State. Casey, supra, at 873\n(plurality opinion) (\u201cStates are free to enact laws to pro\nvide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a deci\nsion that has such profound and lasting meaning\u201d). The\nState has an interest in ensuring so grave a choice is well\ninformed. It is self-evident that a mother who comes to\nregret her choice to abort must struggle with grief more\nanguished and sorrow more profound when she learns,\nonly after the event, what she once did not know: that she\nallowed a doctor to pierce the skull and vacuum the fast-\ndeveloping brain of her unborn child, a child assuming the\nhuman form.\n  It is a reasonable inference that a necessary effect of the\n30                  GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nregulation and the knowledge it conveys will be to encour\nage some women to carry the infant to full term, thus\nreducing the absolute number of late-term abortions. The\nmedical profession, furthermore, may find different and\nless shocking methods to abort the fetus in the second\ntrimester, thereby accommodating legislative demand.\nThe State\u2019s interest in respect for life is advanced by the\ndialogue that better informs the political and legal sys\ntems, the medical profession, expectant mothers, and\nsociety as a whole of the consequences that follow from a\ndecision to elect a late-term abortion.\n   It is objected that the standard D&E is in some respects\nas brutal, if not more, than the intact D&E, so that the\nlegislation accomplishes little. What we have already\nsaid, however, shows ample justification for the regula\ntion. Partial-birth abortion, as defined by the Act, differs\nfrom a standard D&E because the former occurs when the\nfetus is partially outside the mother to the point of one of\nthe Act\u2019s anatomical landmarks. It was reasonable for\nCongress to think that partial-birth abortion, more than\nstandard D&E, \u201cundermines the public\u2019s perception of the\nappropriate role of a physician during the delivery process,\nand perverts a process during which life is brought into\nthe world.\u201d Congressional Findings (14)(K), in notes\nfollowing 18 U. S. C. \u00a71531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769.\nThere would be a flaw in this Court\u2019s logic, and an irony in\nits jurisprudence, were we first to conclude a ban on both\nD&E and intact D&E was overbroad and then to say it is\nirrational to ban only intact D&E because that does not\nproscribe both procedures. In sum, we reject the conten\ntion that the congressional purpose of the Act was \u201cto\nplace a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seek\ning an abortion.\u201d 505 U. S., at 878 (plurality opinion).\n                              B\n     The Act\u2019s furtherance of legitimate government inter\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nests bears upon, but does not resolve, the next question:\nwhether the Act has the effect of imposing an unconstitu\ntional burden on the abortion right because it does not\nallow use of the barred procedure where \u201c \u2018necessary, in\nappropriate medical judgment, for [the] preservation of\nthe . . . health of the mother.\u2019 \u201d Ayotte, 546 U. S., at 327\u2013\n328 (quoting Casey, supra, at 879 (plurality opinion)). The\nprohibition in the Act would be unconstitutional, under\nprecedents we here assume to be controlling, if it \u201csub\nject[ed] [women] to significant health risks.\u201d Ayotte, su\npra, at 328; see also Casey, supra, at 880 (opinion of the\nCourt). In Ayotte the parties agreed a health exception to\nthe challenged parental-involvement statute was neces\nsary \u201cto avert serious and often irreversible damage to [a\npregnant minor\u2019s] health.\u201d 546 U. S., at 328. Here, by\ncontrast, whether the Act creates significant health risks\nfor women has been a contested factual question. The\nevidence presented in the trial courts and before Congress\ndemonstrates both sides have medical support for their\nposition.\n   Respondents presented evidence that intact D&E may\nbe the safest method of abortion, for reasons similar to\nthose adduced in Stenberg. See 530 U. S., at 932. Abor\ntion doctors testified, for example, that intact D&E de\ncreases the risk of cervical laceration or uterine perfora\ntion because it requires fewer passes into the uterus with\nsurgical instruments and does not require the removal of\nbony fragments of the dismembered fetus, fragments that\nmay be sharp. Respondents also presented evidence that\nintact D&E was safer both because it reduces the risks\nthat fetal parts will remain in the uterus and because it\ntakes less time to complete. Respondents, in addition,\nproffered evidence that intact D&E was safer for women\nwith certain medical conditions or women with fetuses\nthat had certain anomalies. See, e.g., Carhart, 331\nF. Supp. 2d, at 923\u2013929; Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,\n32                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 470\u2013474; Planned Parenthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 982\u2013\n983.\n   These contentions were contradicted by other doctors\nwho testified in the District Courts and before Congress.\nThey concluded that the alleged health advantages were\nbased on speculation without scientific studies to support\nthem. They considered D&E always to be a safe alterna\ntive. See, e.g., Carhart, supra, at 930\u2013940; Nat. Abortion\nFederation, 330 F. Supp. 2d, at 470\u2013474; Planned Parent\nhood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 983.\n   There is documented medical disagreement whether the\nAct\u2019s prohibition would ever impose significant health\nrisks on women. See, e.g., id., at 1033 (\u201c[T]here continues\nto be a division of opinion among highly qualified experts\nregarding the necessity or safety of intact D & E\u201d); see also\nNat. Abortion Federation, supra, at 482. The three Dis\ntrict Courts that considered the Act\u2019s constitutionality\nappeared to be in some disagreement on this central fac\ntual question. The District Court for the District of Ne\nbraska concluded \u201cthe banned procedure is, sometimes,\nthe safest abortion procedure to preserve the health of\nwomen.\u201d Carhart, supra, at 1017. The District Court for\nthe Northern District of California reached a similar\nconclusion. Planned Parenthood, supra, at 1002 (finding\nintact D&E was \u201cunder certain circumstances . . . signifi\ncantly safer than D & E by disarticulation\u201d). The District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York was more\nskeptical of the purported health benefits of intact D&E.\nIt found the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cexpert witnesses rea\nsonably and effectively refuted [the plaintiffs\u2019] proffered\nbases for the opinion that [intact D&E] has safety advan\ntages over other second-trimester abortion procedures.\u201d\nNat. Abortion Federation, 330 F. Supp. 2d, at 479. In\naddition it did \u201cnot believe that many of [the plaintiffs\u2019]\npurported reasons for why [intact D&E] is medically nec\nessary [were] credible; rather [it found them to be] theo\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

The court nonetheless invali\ndated the Act because it determined \u201ca significant body of\nmedical opinion . . . holds that D & E has safety advan\ntages over induction and that [intact D&E] has some\nsafety advantages (however hypothetical and unsubstan\ntiated by scientific evidence) over D & E for some women\nin some circumstances.\u201d Ibid.\n   The question becomes whether the Act can stand when\nthis medical uncertainty persists. The Court\u2019s precedents\ninstruct that the Act can survive this facial attack. The\nCourt has given state and federal legislatures wide discre\ntion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and\nscientific uncertainty. See Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S.\n346, 360, n. 3 (1997); Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354,\n364\u2013365, n. 13, 370 (1983); Lambert v. Yellowley, 272 U. S.\n581, 597 (1926); Collins v. Texas, 223 U. S. 288, 297\u2013298\n(1912); Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11, 30\u201331\n(1905); see also Stenberg, supra, at 969\u2013972 (KENNEDY, J.,\ndissenting); Marshall v. United States, 414 U. S. 417, 427\n(1974) (\u201cWhen Congress undertakes to act in areas fraught\nwith medical and scientific uncertainties, legislative op\ntions must be especially broad\u201d).\n   This traditional rule is consistent with Casey, which\nconfirms the State\u2019s interest in promoting respect for\nhuman life at all stages in the pregnancy. Physicians are\nnot entitled to ignore regulations that direct them to use\nreasonable alternative procedures. The law need not give\nabortion doctors unfettered choice in the course of their\nmedical practice, nor should it elevate their status above\nother physicians in the medical community. In Casey the\ncontrolling opinion held an informed-consent requirement\nin the abortion context was \u201cno different from a require\nment that a doctor give certain specific information about\nany medical procedure.\u201d 505 U. S., at 884 (joint opinion).\nThe opinion stated \u201cthe doctor-patient relation here is\nentitled to the same solicitude it receives in other con\n34                 GONZALES v.

See Hendricks, supra, at 360, n. 3.\nThe medical uncertainty over whether the Act\u2019s prohibi\ntion creates significant health risks provides a sufficient\nbasis to conclude in this facial attack that the Act does not\nimpose an undue burden.\n   The conclusion that the Act does not impose an undue\nburden is supported by other considerations. Alternatives\nare available to the prohibited procedure. As we have\nnoted, the Act does not proscribe D&E. One District Court\nfound D&E to have extremely low rates of medical compli\ncations. Planned Parenthood, supra, at 1000. Another\nindicated D&E was \u201cgenerally the safest method of abor\ntion during the second trimester.\u201d Carhart, 331 F. Supp.\n2d, at 1031; see also Nat. Abortion Federation, supra, at\n467\u2013468 (explaining that \u201c[e]xperts testifying for both\nsides\u201d agreed D&E was safe).

S. 52, 77\u2013\n79 (1976), in which the Court invalidated a ban on saline\namniocentesis, the then-dominant second-trimester abor\ntion method. The Court found the ban in Danforth to be\n\u201can unreasonable or arbitrary regulation designed to\ninhibit, and having the effect of inhibiting, the vast major\nity of abortions after the first 12 weeks.\u201d Id., at 79. Here\nthe Act allows, among other means, a commonly used and\ngenerally accepted method, so it does not construct a\nsubstantial obstacle to the abortion right.\n   In reaching the conclusion the Act does not require a\nhealth exception we reject certain arguments made by the\nparties on both sides of these cases. On the one hand, the\nAttorney General urges us to uphold the Act on the basis\nof the congressional findings alone. Brief for Petitioner in\nNo. 05\u2013380, at 23. Although we review congressional\nfactfinding under a deferential standard, we do not in the\ncircumstances here place dispositive weight on Congress\u2019\nfindings. The Court retains an independent constitutional\nduty to review factual findings where constitutional rights\nare at stake. See Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 60\n(1932) (\u201cIn cases brought to enforce constitutional rights,\nthe judicial power of the United States necessarily extends\nto the independent determination of all questions, both of\nfact and law, necessary to the performance of that su\npreme function\u201d).\n   As respondents have noted, and the District Courts\nrecognized, some recitations in the Act are factually incor\nrect. See Nat. Abortion Federation, 330 F. Supp. 2d, at\n482, 488\u2013491. Whether or not accurate at the time, some\nof the important findings have been superseded. Two\nexamples suffice. Congress determined no medical schools\nprovide instruction on the prohibited procedure. Congres\nsional Findings (14)(B), in notes following 18 U. S. C.\n36                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769. The testimony in the\nDistrict Courts, however, demonstrated intact D&E is\ntaught at medical schools. Nat. Abortion Federation,\nsupra, at 490; Planned Parenthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1029. Congress also found there existed a medical consen\nsus that the prohibited procedure is never medically nec\nessary. Congressional Findings (1), in notes following 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 767. The evidence\npresented in the District Courts contradicts that conclu\nsion. See, e.g., Carhart, supra, at 1012\u20131015; Nat. Abor\ntion Federation, supra, at 488\u2013489; Planned Parenthood,\nsupra, at 1025\u20131026. Uncritical deference to Congress\u2019\nfactual findings in these cases is inappropriate.\n   On the other hand, relying on the Court\u2019s opinion in\nStenberg, respondents contend that an abortion regulation\nmust contain a health exception \u201cif \u2018substantial medical\nauthority supports the proposition that banning a particu\nlar procedure could endanger women\u2019s health.\u2019 \u201d Brief for\nRespondents in No. 05\u2013380, p. 19 (quoting 530 U. S., at\n938); see also Brief for Respondent Planned Parenthood\net al. in No. 05\u20131382, at 12 (same). As illustrated by\nrespondents\u2019 arguments and the decisions of the Courts of\nAppeals, Stenberg has been interpreted to leave no margin\nof error for legislatures to act in the face of medical uncer\ntainty. Carhart, 413 F. 3d, at 796; Planned Parenthood,\n435 F. 3d, at 1173; see also Nat. Abortion Federation, 437\nF. 3d, at 296 (Walker, C. J., concurring) (explaining the\nstandard under Stenberg \u201cis a virtually insurmountable\nevidentiary hurdle\u201d).\n   A zero tolerance policy would strike down legitimate\nabortion regulations, like the present one, if some part of\nthe medical community were disinclined to follow the\nproscription. This is too exacting a standard to impose on\nthe legislative power, exercised in this instance under the\nCommerce Clause, to regulate the medical profession.\nConsiderations of marginal safety, including the balance of\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)          37\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrisks, are within the legislative competence when the\nregulation is rational and in pursuit of legitimate ends.\nWhen standard medical options are available, mere con\nvenience does not suffice to displace them; and if some\nprocedures have different risks than others, it does not\nfollow that the State is altogether barred from imposing\nreasonable regulations. The Act is not invalid on its face\nwhere there is uncertainty over whether the barred proce\ndure is ever necessary to preserve a woman\u2019s health, given\nthe availability of other abortion procedures that are\nconsidered to be safe alternatives.\n                             V\n   The considerations we have discussed support our fur\nther determination that these facial attacks should not\nhave been entertained in the first instance. In these\ncircumstances the proper means to consider exceptions is\nby as-applied challenge. The Government has acknowl\nedged that preenforcement, as-applied challenges to the\nAct can be maintained. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05\u2013380, pp.\n21\u201323. This is the proper manner to protect the health of\nthe woman if it can be shown that in discrete and well-\ndefined instances a particular condition has or is likely to\noccur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must\nbe used. In an as-applied challenge the nature of the\nmedical risk can be better quantified and balanced than in\na facial attack.\n   The latitude given facial challenges in the First\nAmendment context is inapplicable here. Broad chal\nlenges of this type impose \u201ca heavy burden\u201d upon the\nparties maintaining the suit. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S.\n173, 183 (1991). What that burden consists of in the\nspecific context of abortion statutes has been a subject of\nsome question. Compare Ohio v. Akron Center for Repro\nductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 514 (1990) (\u201c[B]ecause\nappellees are making a facial challenge to a statute, they\n38                 GONZALES v.

See also Janklow v. Planned Parenthood, Sioux\nFalls Clinic, 517 U. S. 1174 (1996). We need not resolve\nthat debate.\n   As the previous sections of this opinion explain, respon\ndents have not demonstrated that the Act would be uncon\nstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases. Casey,\nsupra, at 895 (opinion of the Court). We note that the\nstatute here applies to all instances in which the doctor\nproposes to use the prohibited procedure, not merely those\nin which the woman suffers from medical complications.\nIt is neither our obligation nor within our traditional\ninstitutional role to resolve questions of constitutionality\nwith respect to each potential situation that might de\nvelop. \u201c[I]t would indeed be undesirable for this Court to\nconsider every conceivable situation which might possibly\narise in the application of complex and comprehensive\nlegislation.\u201d United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 21\n(1960) (internal quotation marks omitted). For this rea\nson, \u201c[a]s-applied challenges are the basic building blocks\nof constitutional adjudication.\u201d Fallon, As-Applied and\nFacial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv.\nL. Rev. 1321, 1328 (2000).\n   The Act is open to a proper as-applied challenge in a\ndiscrete case. Cf. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal\nElection Comm\u2019n, 546 U. S. 410, 411\u2013412 (2006) (per\ncuriam). No as-applied challenge need be brought if the\nprohibition in the Act threatens a woman\u2019s life because the\nAct already contains a life exception. 18 U. S.

Casey,\n505 U. S. 833, 844 (1992), the Court declared that\n\u201c[l]iberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt.\u201d\nThere was, the Court said, an \u201cimperative\u201d need to dispel\ndoubt as to \u201cthe meaning and reach\u201d of the Court\u2019s 7-to-2\njudgment, rendered nearly two decades earlier in Roe v.\nWade, 410 U.

Responsive\nto that need, the Court endeavored to provide secure\nguidance to \u201c[s]tate and federal courts as well as legisla\ntures throughout the Union,\u201d by defining \u201cthe rights of the\nwoman and the legitimate authority of the State respect\ning the termination of pregnancies by abortion proce\n2                     GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndures.\u201d Ibid.\n   Taking care to speak plainly, the Casey Court restated\nand reaffirmed Roe\u2019s essential holding. 505 U. S., at 845\u2013\n846. First, the Court addressed the type of abortion regu\nlation permissible prior to fetal viability. It recognized\n\u201cthe right of the woman to choose to have an abortion\nbefore viability and to obtain it without undue interfer\nence from the State.\u201d Id., at 846. Second, the Court ac\nknowledged \u201cthe State\u2019s power to restrict abortions after\nfetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnan\ncies which endanger the woman\u2019s life or health.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis added). Third, the Court confirmed that \u201cthe\nState has legitimate interests from the outset of the preg\nnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of\nthe fetus that may become a child.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis\nadded).\n   In reaffirming Roe, the Casey Court described the cen\ntrality of \u201cthe decision whether to bear . . . a child,\u201d Eisen\nstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 453 (1972), to a woman\u2019s\n\u201cdignity and autonomy,\u201d her \u201cpersonhood\u201d and \u201cdestiny,\u201d\nher \u201cconception of . . . her place in society.\u201d 505 U. S., at\n851\u2013852. Of signal importance here, the Casey Court\nstated with unmistakable clarity that state regulation of\naccess to abortion procedures, even after viability, must\nprotect \u201cthe health of the woman.\u201d Id., at 846.\n   Seven years ago, in Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U. S. 914\n(2000), the Court invalidated a Nebraska statute criminal\nizing the performance of a medical procedure that, in the\npolitical arena, has been dubbed \u201cpartial-birth abortion.\u201d1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The term \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d is neither recognized in the medi\n\ncal literature nor used by physicians who perform second-trimester\nabortions. See Planned Parenthood Federation of Am. v. Ashcroft, 320\nF. Supp. 2d 957, 964 (ND Cal. 2004), aff\u2019d, 435 F. 3d 1163 (CA9 2006).\nThe medical community refers to the procedure as either dilation &\nextraction (D&X) or intact dilation and evacuation (intact D&E). See,\ne.g., ante, at 5; Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U. S. 914, 927 (2000).\n                     Cite as: 550 U.

Stenberg, 530 U. S., at 930; cf.\nAyotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546\nU. S. 320, 327 (2006).\n   Today\u2019s decision is alarming. It refuses to take Casey\nand Stenberg seriously. It tolerates, indeed applauds,\nfederal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found\nnecessary and proper in certain cases by the American\nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). It\nblurs the line, firmly drawn in Casey, between previability\nand postviability abortions. And, for the first time since\nRoe, the Court blesses a prohibition with no exception\nsafeguarding a woman\u2019s health.\n   I dissent from the Court\u2019s disposition. Retreating from\nprior rulings that abortion restrictions cannot be imposed\nabsent an exception safeguarding a woman\u2019s health, the\nCourt upholds an Act that surely would not survive under\nthe close scrutiny that previously attended state-decreed\nlimitations on a woman\u2019s reproductive choices.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  As Casey comprehended, at stake in cases challenging\nabortion restrictions is a woman\u2019s \u201ccontrol over her [own]\ndestiny.\u201d 505 U.

S. 57, 62 (1961)). Those views, this Court\nmade clear in Casey, \u201care no longer consistent with our\nunderstanding of the family, the individual, or the Consti\ntution.\u201d 505 U. S., at 897. Women, it is now acknowl\nedged, have the talent, capacity, and right \u201cto participate\nequally in the economic and social life of the Nation.\u201d Id.,\nat 856. Their ability to realize their full potential, the\nCourt recognized, is intimately connected to \u201ctheir ability\nto control their reproductive lives.\u201d Ibid. Thus, legal\nchallenges to undue restrictions on abortion procedures do\nnot seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy;\nrather, they center on a woman\u2019s autonomy to determine\nher life\u2019s course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stat\nure. See, e.g., Siegel, Reasoning from the Body: A Histori\ncal Perspective on Abortion Regulation and Questions of\nEqual Protection, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 261 (1992); Law, Re\nthinking Sex and the Constitution, 132 U. Pa. L. Rev. 955,\n1002\u20131028 (1984).\n   In keeping with this comprehension of the right to re\nproductive choice, the Court has consistently required that\nlaws regulating abortion, at any stage of pregnancy and in\nall cases, safeguard a woman\u2019s health. See, e.g., Ayotte,\n546 U. S., at 327\u2013328 (\u201c[O]ur precedents hold . . . that a\nState may not restrict access to abortions that are neces\nsary, in appropriate medical judgment, for preservation of\nthe life or health of the [woman].\u201d (quoting Casey, 505\nU. S., at 879 (plurality opinion))); Stenberg, 530 U. S., at\n930 (\u201cSince the law requires a health exception in order to\nvalidate even a postviability abortion regulation, it at a\nminimum requires the same in respect to previability\nregulation.\u201d). See also Thornburgh v. American College of\nObstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 768\u2013769\n(1986) (invalidating a post-viability abortion regulation for\n\u201cfail[ure] to require that [a pregnant woman\u2019s] health be\n                     Cite as: 550 U.

See\nPlanned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S.\n52, 79 (1976) (holding unconstitutional a ban on a method\nof abortion that \u201cforce[d] a woman . . . to terminate her\npregnancy by methods more dangerous to her health\u201d).\nSee also Stenberg, 530 U.

See ante, at 4, 6; Stenberg, 530 U. S., at\n924, 927; Planned Parenthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 966. Second-\ntrimester abortions (i.e., midpregnancy, previability abortions) are,\nhowever, relatively uncommon. Between 85 and 90 percent of all\nabortions performed in the United States take place during the first\nthree months of pregnancy. See ante, at 3. See also Stenberg, 530\nU. S., at 923\u2013927; National Abortion Federation v. Ashcroft, 330\nF. Supp. 2d 436, 464 (SDNY 2004), aff\u2019d sub nom. National Abortion\nFederation v. Gonzales, 437 F. 3d 278 (CA2 2006); Planned Parenthood,\n320 F.

Thus the absence of a health exception\nburdens all women for whom it is relevant\u2014women who,\nin the judgment of their doctors, require an intact D&E\nbecause other procedures would place their health at\nrisk.10 Cf. Stenberg, 530 U.

S., at\n328 (facial challenge entertained where \u201c[i]n some very\nsmall percentage of cases . . . women . . . need immediate\nabortions to avert serious, and often irreversible damage\nto their health\u201d).

Perhaps for this reason, in mandat\ning safeguards for women\u2019s health, we have never before invoked the\n\u201clarge fraction\u201d test.\n22                 GONZALES v. CARHART\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsecond-trimester abortions, including those for which a\nhealth exception is unnecessary: The very purpose of a\nhealth exception is to protect women in exceptional cases.\n                               B\n   If there is anything at all redemptive to be said of to\nday\u2019s opinion, it is that the Court is not willing to foreclose\nentirely a constitutional challenge to the Act. \u201cThe Act is\nopen,\u201d the Court states, \u201cto a proper as-applied challenge\nin a discrete case.\u201d Ante, at 38; see ante, at 37 (\u201cThe Gov\nernment has acknowledged that preenforcement, as-\napplied challenges to the Act can be maintained.\u201d). But\nthe Court offers no clue on what a \u201cproper\u201d lawsuit might\nlook like. See ante, at 37\u201338. Nor does the Court explain\nwhy the injunctions ordered by the District Courts should\nnot remain in place, trimmed only to exclude instances in\nwhich another procedure would safeguard a woman\u2019s\nhealth at least equally well. Surely the Court cannot\nmean that no suit may be brought until a woman\u2019s health\nis immediately jeopardized by the ban on intact D&E. A\nwoman \u201csuffer[ing] from medical complications,\u201d ante, at\n38, needs access to the medical procedure at once and\ncannot wait for the judicial process to unfold. See Ayotte,\n546 U. S., at 328.\n   The Court appears, then, to contemplate another law\nsuit by the initiators of the instant actions. In such a\nsecond round, the Court suggests, the challengers could\nsucceed upon demonstrating that \u201cin discrete and well-\ndefined instances a particular condition has or is likely to\noccur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must\nbe used.\u201d Ante, at 37. One may anticipate that such a\npreenforcement challenge will be mounted swiftly, to ward\noff serious, sometimes irremediable harm, to women\nwhose health would be endangered by the intact D&E\nprohibition.\n   The Court envisions that in an as-applied challenge,\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)          23\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cthe nature of the medical risk can be better quantified\nand balanced.\u201d Ibid. But it should not escape notice that\nthe record already includes hundreds and hundreds of\npages of testimony identifying \u201cdiscrete and well-defined\ninstances\u201d in which recourse to an intact D&E would\nbetter protect the health of women with particular condi\ntions. See supra, at 10\u201311. Record evidence also docu\nments that medical exigencies, unpredictable in advance,\nmay indicate to a well-trained doctor that intact D&E is\nthe safest procedure. See ibid. In light of this evidence,\nour unanimous decision just one year ago in Ayotte coun\nsels against reversal. See 546 U. S., at 331 (remanding for\nreconsideration of the remedy for the absence of a health\nexception, suggesting that an injunction prohibiting un\nconstitutional applications might suffice).\n   The Court\u2019s allowance only of an \u201cas-applied challenge\nin a discrete case,\u201d ante, at 38\u2014jeopardizes women\u2019s\nhealth and places doctors in an untenable position. Even\nif courts were able to carve-out exceptions through piece\nmeal litigation for \u201cdiscrete and well-defined instances,\u201d\nante, at 37, women whose circumstances have not been\nanticipated by prior litigation could well be left unpro\ntected. In treating those women, physicians would risk\ncriminal prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment if they\nexercise their best judgment as to the safest medical pro\ncedure for their patients. The Court is thus gravely mis\ntaken to conclude that narrow as-applied challenges are\n\u201cthe proper manner to protect the health of the woman.\u201d\nCf. ibid.\n                              IV\n  As the Court wrote in Casey, \u201coverruling Roe\u2019s central\nholding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under\nprinciples of stare decisis, but would seriously weaken the\nCourt\u2019s capacity to exercise the judicial power and to\nfunction as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to\n24                 GONZALES v.

See also id., at\n867 (\u201c[T]o overrule under fire in the absence of the most\ncompelling reason to reexamine a watershed decision\nwould subvert the Court\u2019s legitimacy beyond any serious\nquestion.\u201d).\n   Though today\u2019s opinion does not go so far as to discard\nRoe or Casey, the Court, differently composed than it was\nwhen we last considered a restrictive abortion regulation,\nis hardly faithful to our earlier invocations of \u201cthe rule of\nlaw\u201d and the \u201cprinciples of stare decisis.\u201d Congress im\nposed a ban despite our clear prior holdings that the State\ncannot proscribe an abortion procedure when its use is\nnecessary to protect a woman\u2019s health. See supra, at 7,\nn. 4. Although Congress\u2019 findings could not withstand the\ncrucible of trial, the Court defers to the legislative override\nof our Constitution-based rulings. See supra, at 7\u20139. A\ndecision so at odds with our jurisprudence should not have\nstaying power.\n   In sum, the notion that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban\nAct furthers any legitimate governmental interest is, quite\nsimply, irrational. The Court\u2019s defense of the statute\nprovides no saving explanation. In candor, the Act, and\nthe Court\u2019s defense of it, cannot be understood as anything\nother than an effort to chip away at a right declared again\nand again by this Court\u2014and with increasing comprehen\nsion of its centrality to women\u2019s lives.

In recitations preceding its operative provisions the Act refers to the Court's opinion in <i>Stenberg v. Carhart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118387\"><a href=\"/opinion/118387/stenberg-v-carhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2597, 147 L.Ed.2d 743 (2000), which also addressed the subject of abortion procedures used in the later stages of pregnancy. Compared to the state statute at issue in <i>Stenberg,</i> the Act is more specific concerning the instances to which it applies and in this respect more precise in its coverage. We conclude the Act should be sustained against the objections lodged by the broad, facial attack brought against it.</p>\n<p>In No. 05-380 <i>(Carhart)</i> respondents are LeRoy Carhart, William G. Fitzhugh, William H. Knorr, and Jill L. Vibhakar, doctors who perform second-trimester abortions. These doctors filed their complaint against the Attorney General of the United States in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska. They challenged the constitutionality of the Act and sought a permanent injunction against its enforcement. <i>Carhart v. Ashcroft,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d 805 (2004). In 2004, after a 2-week trial, the District Court granted a permanent injunction that prohibited the Attorney General from enforcing the Act in all cases but those in which there was no dispute the fetus was viable. <i>Id.,</i> at 1048. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790868\"><a href=\"/opinion/790868/leroy-carhart-md-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-the-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span> (2005).

In 2004, the District Court held a trial spanning a period just short of three weeks, and it, too, enjoined the Attorney General from enforcing the Act. <i>Id.,</i> at 1035. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793122\"><a href=\"/opinion/793122/planned-parenthood-federation-of-america-inc-plann/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1163</span></a></span> (2006).

Three United States District Courts heard extensive evidence describing the procedures. In addition to the two courts involved in the instant cases the District Court for the Southern District of New York also considered the constitutionality of the Act. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation v. Ashcroft,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d 436 (2004). It found the Act unconstitutional, <i>id.,</i> at 493, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, <i>Nat. Abortion Federation v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793256\"><a href=\"/opinion/793256/national-abortion-federation-mark-i-evans-md-carol/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span> (2006). The three District Courts relied on similar medical evidence; indeed, much of the evidence submitted to the <i>Carhart</i> court previously had been submitted to the other two courts. 331 F.Supp.2d, at 809-810. We refer to the District Courts' exhaustive opinions in our own discussion of abortion procedures.</p>\n<p>Abortion methods vary depending to some extent on the preferences of the physician and, of course, on the term of the pregnancy and the resulting stage of the unborn child's development. Between 85 and 90 percent of the approximately 1.3 million abortions performed each year in the United States take place in the first three months of pregnancy, which is to say in the first trimester. <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 960, and n. 4; App. in No. 05-1382, pp. 45-48. The most common first-trimester abortion method is vacuum aspiration (otherwise known as suction curettage) in which the physician vacuums out the embryonic tissue. Early in this trimester an alternative is to use medication, such as mifepristone (commonly known as RU-486), to terminate the pregnancy. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 464, n. 20. The Act does not regulate these procedures.</p>\n<p>Of the remaining abortions that take place each year, most occur in the second trimester. The surgical procedure referred to as \"dilation and evacuation\" or \"D &amp; E\" is the usual abortion method in this trimester. <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 960-961. Although individual techniques for performing D &amp; E differ, the general steps are the same.</p>\n<p>A doctor must first dilate the cervix at least to the extent needed to insert surgical instruments into the uterus and to maneuver them to evacuate the fetus. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 465; App. in No. 05-1382, at 61. The steps taken to cause dilation differ by physician and gestational age of the fetus. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 852, 856, 859, 862-865, 868, 870, 873-874, 876-877, 880, 883, 886. A doctor often begins the dilation process by inserting osmotic dilators, such as laminaria (sticks of seaweed), into the cervix. The dilators can be used in combination with drugs, such as misoprostol, that increase dilation. The resulting amount of dilation is not uniform, and a doctor does not know in advance how an individual patient will respond. In general the longer dilators remain in the cervix, the more it will dilate. Yet the length of time doctors employ osmotic dilators varies. Some may keep dilators in the cervix <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1621</span> for two days, while others use dilators for a day or less. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 464-465; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 961.</p>\n<p>After sufficient dilation the surgical operation can commence. The woman is placed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. The doctor, often guided by ultrasound, inserts grasping forceps through the woman's cervix and into the uterus to grab the fetus. The doctor grips a fetal part with the forceps and pulls it back through the cervix and vagina, continuing to pull even after meeting resistance from the cervix. The friction causes the fetus to tear apart. For example, a leg might be ripped off the fetus as it is pulled through the cervix and out of the woman. The process of evacuating the fetus piece by piece continues until it has been completely removed. A doctor may make 10 to 15 passes with the forceps to evacuate the fetus in its entirety, though sometimes removal is completed with fewer passes. Once the fetus has been evacuated, the placenta and any remaining fetal material are suctioned or scraped out of the uterus. The doctor examines the different parts to ensure the entire fetal body has been removed. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 465; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 962.</p>\n<p>Some doctors, especially later in the second trimester, may kill the fetus a day or two before performing the surgical evacuation. They inject digoxin or potassium chloride into the fetus, the umbilical cord, or the amniotic fluid. Fetal demise may cause contractions and make greater dilation possible. Once dead, moreover, the fetus' body will soften, and its removal will be easier. Other doctors refrain from injecting chemical agents, believing it adds risk with little or no medical benefit. <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 907-912; <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 474-475.</p>\n<p>The abortion procedure that was the impetus for the numerous bans on \"partial-birth abortion,\" including the Act, is a variation of this standard D &amp; E. See M. Haskell, Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion (1992), 1 Appellant's App. in No. 04-3379(CA8), p. 109 (hereinafter Dilation and Extraction). The medical community has not reached unanimity on the appropriate name for this D &amp; E variation. It has been referred to as \"intact D &amp; E,\" \"dilation and extraction\" (D &amp; X), and \"intact D &amp; X.\" <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 440, n. 2; see also F. Cunningham et al., Williams Obstetrics 243 (22d ed.2005) (identifying the procedure as D &amp; X); Danforth's Obstetrics and Gynecology 567 (J. Scott, R. Gibbs, B. Karlan, &amp; A. Haney eds. 9th ed.2003) (identifying the procedure as intact D &amp; X); M. Paul, E. Lichtenberg, L. Borgatta, D. Grimes, &amp; P. Stubblefield, A Clinician's Guide to Medical and Surgical Abortion 136 (1999) (identifying the procedure as intact D &amp; E). For discussion purposes this D &amp; E variation will be referred to as intact D &amp; E. The main difference between the two procedures is that in intact D &amp; E a doctor extracts the fetus intact or largely intact with only a few passes. There are no comprehensive statistics indicating what percentage of all D &amp; Es are performed in this manner.</p>\n<p>Intact D &amp; E, like regular D &amp; E, begins with dilation of the cervix. Sufficient dilation is essential for the procedure. To achieve intact extraction some doctors thus may attempt to dilate the cervix to a greater degree. This approach has been called \"serial\" dilation. <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 856, 870, 873; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 965. Doctors who attempt at the outset to perform intact D &amp; E may dilate for two full days or use up to 25 osmotic dilators. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Dilation and Extraction 110; <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 865, 868, 876, 886.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1622</span> In an intact D &amp; E procedure the doctor extracts the fetus in a way conducive to pulling out its entire body, instead of ripping it apart. One doctor, for example, testified:</p>\n<blockquote>\"If I know I have good dilation and I reach in and the fetus starts to come out and I think I can accomplish it, the abortion with an intact delivery, then I use my forceps a little bit differently. I don't close them quite so much, and I just gently draw the tissue out attempting to have an intact delivery, if possible.\" App. in No. 05-1382, at 74.</blockquote>\n<p>Rotating the fetus as it is being pulled decreases the odds of dismemberment. <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 868-869; App. in No. 05-380, pp. 40-41; 5 Appellant's App. in No. 04-3379(CA8), p. 1469. A doctor also \"may use forceps to grasp a fetal part, pull it down, and re-grasp the fetus at a higher level\u0097sometimes using both his hand and a forceps\u0097to exert traction to retrieve the fetus intact until the head is lodged in the [cervix].\" <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 886-887.</p>\n<p>Intact D &amp; E gained public notoriety when, in 1992, Dr. Martin Haskell gave a presentation describing his method of performing the operation. Dilation and Extraction 110-111. In the usual intact D &amp; E the fetus' head lodges in the cervix, and dilation is insufficient to allow it to pass. See, <i>e.g., ibid.;</i> App. in No. 05-380, at 577; App. in No. 05-1382, at 74, 282. Haskell explained the next step as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`At this point, the right-handed surgeon slides the fingers of the left [hand] along the back of the fetus and \"hooks\" the shoulders of the fetus with the index and ring fingers (palm down).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`While maintaining this tension, lifting the cervix and applying traction to the shoulders with the fingers of the left hand, the surgeon takes a pair of blunt curved Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances the tip, curved down, along the spine and under his middle finger until he feels it contact the base of the skull under the tip of his middle finger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`[T]he surgeon then forces the scissors into the base of the skull or into the foramen magnum. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the scissors to enlarge the opening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents. With the catheter still in place, he applies traction to the fetus, removing it completely from the patient.'\" H.R.Rep. No. 108-58, p. 3 (2003).</blockquote>\n<p>This is an abortion doctor's clinical description. Here is another description from a nurse who witnessed the same method performed on a 26\u00bd-week fetus and who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`Dr. Haskell went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's legs and pulled them down into the birth canal. Then he delivered the baby's body and the arms\u0097everything but the head. The doctor kept the head right inside the uterus. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does when he thinks he is going to fall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby's brains out. Now the baby went completely limp. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`He cut the umbilical cord and delivered the placenta. He threw the baby <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1623</span> in a pan, along with the placenta and the instruments he had just used.'\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Haskell's approach is not the only method of killing the fetus once its head lodges in the cervix, and \"the process has evolved\" since his presentation. <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 965. Another doctor, for example, squeezes the skull after it has been pierced \"so that enough brain tissue exudes to allow the head to pass through.\" App. in No. 05-380, at 41; see also <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 866-867, 874. Still other physicians reach into the cervix with their forceps and crush the fetus' skull. <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 858, 881. Others continue to pull the fetus out of the woman until it disarticulates at the neck, in effect decapitating it. These doctors then grasp the head with forceps, crush it, and remove it. <i>Id.,</i> at 864, 878; see also <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 965.</p>\n<p>Some doctors performing an intact D &amp; E attempt to remove the fetus without collapsing the skull. See <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 866, 869. Yet one doctor would not allow delivery of a live fetus younger than 24 weeks because \"the objective of [his] procedure is to perform an abortion,\" not a birth. App. in No. 05-1382, at 408-409. The doctor thus answered in the affirmative when asked whether he would \"hold the fetus' head on the internal side of the [cervix] in order to collapse the skull\" and kill the fetus before it is born. <i>Id.,</i> at 409; see also <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 862, 878. Another doctor testified he crushes a fetus' skull not only to reduce its size but also to ensure the fetus is dead before it is removed. For the staff to have to deal with a fetus that has \"some viability to it, some movement of limbs,\" according to this doctor, \"[is] always a difficult situation.\" App. in No. 05-380, at 94; see <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 858.</p>\n<p>D &amp; E and intact D &amp; E are not the only second-trimester abortion methods. Doctors also may abort a fetus through medical induction. The doctor medicates the woman to induce labor, and contractions occur to deliver the fetus. Induction, which unlike D &amp; E should occur in a hospital, can last as little as 6 hours but can take longer than 48. It accounts for about five percent of second-trimester abortions before 20 weeks of gestation and 15 percent of those after 20 weeks. Doctors turn to two other methods of second-trimester abortion, hysterotomy and hysterectomy, only in emergency situations because they carry increased risk of complications. In a hysterotomy, as in a cesarean section, the doctor removes the fetus by making an incision through the abdomen and uterine wall to gain access to the uterine cavity. A hysterectomy requires the removal of the entire uterus. These two procedures represent about .07% of second-trimester abortions. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 467; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 962-963.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>After Dr. Haskell's procedure received public attention, with ensuing and increasing public concern, bans on \"`partial birth abortion'\" proliferated. By the time of the <i>Stenberg</i> decision, about 30 States had enacted bans designed to prohibit the procedure. 530 U.S., at 995-996, and nn. 12-13, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); see also H.R.Rep. No. 108-58, at 4-5. In 1996, Congress also acted to ban partial-birth abortion. President Clinton vetoed the congressional legislation, and the Senate failed to override the veto. Congress approved another bill banning the procedure in 1997, but President Clinton again vetoed it. In 2003, after this Court's decision in <i>Stenberg,</i> Congress passed the Act at issue here. H.R.Rep. No. 108-58, at 12-14. On November 5, 2003, President <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1624</span> Bush signed the Act into law. It was to take effect the following day. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>The Act responded to <i>Stenberg</i> in two ways. First, Congress made factual findings. Congress determined that this Court in <i>Stenberg</i> \"was required to accept the very questionable findings issued by the district court judge,\" \u00a7 2(7), 117 Stat. 1202, notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 768, \u00b6 (7) (Congressional Findings), but that Congress was \"not bound to accept the same factual findings,\" <i>ibid.,</i> \u00b6 (8). Congress found, among other things, that \"[a] moral, medical, and ethical consensus exists that the practice of performing a partial-birth abortion . . . is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 767, \u00b6 (1).</p>\n<p>Second, and more relevant here, the Act's language differs from that of the Nebraska statute struck down in <i>Stenberg.</i> See 530 U.S., at 921-922, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (quoting Neb.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 28-328(1), 28-326(9) (Supp.1999)). The operative provisions of the Act provide in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both. This subsection does not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. This subsection takes effect 1 day after the enactment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) As used in this section\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) the term `partial-birth abortion' means an abortion in which the person performing the abortion\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother, for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) performs the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) the term `physician' means a doctor of medicine or osteopathy legally authorized to practice medicine and surgery by the State in which the doctor performs such activity, or any other individual legally authorized by the State to perform abortions: <i>Provided, however,</i> That any individual who is not a physician or not otherwise legally authorized by the State to perform abortions, but who nevertheless directly performs a partial-birth abortion, shall be subject to the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(d)(1) A defendant accused of an offense under this section may seek a hearing before the State Medical Board on whether the physician's conduct was necessary to save the life of the mother whose life was endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) The findings on that issue are admissible on that issue at the trial of the defendant. Upon a motion of the defendant, the court shall delay the beginning <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1625</span> of the trial for not more than 30 days to permit such a hearing to take place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(e) A woman upon whom a partial-birth abortion is performed may not be prosecuted under this section, for a conspiracy to violate this section, or for an offense under section 2, 3, or 4 of this title based on a violation of this section.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</blockquote>\n<p>The Act also includes a provision authorizing civil actions that is not of relevance here. \u00a7 1531(c).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The District Court in <i>Carhart</i> concluded the Act was unconstitutional for two reasons. First, it determined the Act was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception allowing the procedure where necessary for the health of the mother. 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1004-1030. Second, the District Court found the Act deficient because it covered not merely intact D &amp; E but also certain other D &amp; Es. <i>Id.,</i> at 1030-1037.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit addressed only the lack of a health exception. 413 F.3d, at 803-804. The court began its analysis with what it saw as the appropriate question\u0097\"whether `substantial medical authority' supports the medical necessity of the banned procedure.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 796 (quoting <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597). This was the proper framework, according to the Court of Appeals, because \"when a lack of consensus exists in the medical community, the Constitution requires legislatures to err on the side of protecting women's health by including a health exception.\" 413 F.3d, at 796. The court rejected the Attorney General's attempt to demonstrate changed evidentiary circumstances since <i>Stenberg</i> and considered itself bound by <i>Stenberg's</i> conclusion that a health exception was required. 413 F.3d, at 803 (explaining \"[t]he record in [the] case and the record in <i>Stenberg</i> [were] similar in all significant respects\"). It invalidated the Act. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>The District Court in <i>Planned Parenthood</i> concluded the Act was unconstitutional \"because it (1) pose[d] an undue burden on a woman's ability to choose a second trimester abortion; (2)[was] unconstitutionally vague; and (3) require[d] a health exception as set forth by . . . <i>Stenberg.</i>\" 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1034-1035.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed. Like the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, it concluded the absence of a health exception rendered the Act unconstitutional. The court interpreted <i>Stenberg</i> to require a health exception unless \"there is <i>consensus in the medical community</i> that the banned procedure is never medically necessary to preserve the health of women.\" 435 F.3d, at 1173. Even after applying a deferential standard of review to Congress' factual findings, the Court of Appeals determined \"substantial disagreement exists in the medical community regarding whether\" the procedures prohibited by the Act are ever necessary to preserve a woman's health. <i>Id.,</i> at 1175-1176.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals concluded further that the Act placed an undue burden on a woman's ability to obtain a second-trimester abortion. The court found the textual differences between the Act and the Nebraska statute struck down in <i>Stenberg</i> insufficient to distinguish D &amp; E and intact D &amp; E. 435 F.3d, at 1178-1180. As a result, according to the Court of Appeals, the Act imposed an undue burden because it prohibited D &amp; E. <i>Id.,</i> at 1180-1181.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court of Appeals found the Act void for vagueness. <i>Id.,</i> at 1181. Abortion doctors testified they were uncertain <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1626</span> which procedures the Act made criminal. The court thus concluded the Act did not offer physicians clear warning of its regulatory reach. <i>Id.,</i> at 1181-1184. Resting on its understanding of the remedial framework established by this Court in <i>Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145691\"><a href=\"/opinion/145691/ayotte-v-planned-parenthood-of-northern-new-eng/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span>, 328-330, 126 S.Ct. 961, 163 L.Ed.2d 812 (2006), the Court of Appeals held the Act was unconstitutional on its face and should be permanently enjoined. 435 F.3d, at 1184-1191.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The principles set forth in the joint opinion in <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.

See <i>id.,</i> at 979-1002, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS, J., <i>inter alios,</i> concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Whatever one's views concerning the <i>Casey</i> joint opinion, it is evident a premise central to its conclusion\u0097that the government has a legitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life\u0097would be repudiated were the Court now to affirm the judgments of the Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p><i>Casey</i> involved a challenge to <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108713\"><a href=\"/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). The opinion contains this summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It must be stated at the outset and with clarity that <i>Roe's</i> essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the State's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life or health. And third is the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. These principles do not contradict one another; and we adhere to each.\" 505 U.S., at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court).</blockquote>\n<p>Though all three holdings are implicated in the instant cases, it is the third that requires the most extended discussion; for we must determine whether the Act furthers the legitimate interest of the Government in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child.</p>\n<p>To implement its holding, <i>Casey</i> rejected both <i>Roe's</i> rigid trimester framework and the interpretation of <i>Roe</i> that considered all previability regulations of abortion unwarranted. 505 U.S., at 875-876, 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). On this point <i>Casey</i> overruled the holdings in two cases because they undervalued the State's interest in potential life. See <i>id.,</i> at 881-883, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (joint opinion) (overruling <i>Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111690\"><a href=\"/opinion/111690/thornburgh-v-american-college-of-obstetricians-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986) and <i>Akron v.

Before viability, a State \"may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy.\" 505 U.S., at 879, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). It also may not impose upon this right an undue burden, which exists if a regulation's \"purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1627</span> seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791. On the other hand, \"[r]egulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the State, or the parent or guardian of a minor, may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 877, 112 S.Ct. 2791. <i>Casey,</i> in short, struck a balance. The balance was central to its holding. We now apply its standard to the cases at bar.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We begin with a determination of the Act's operation and effect. A straightforward reading of the Act's text demonstrates its purpose and the scope of its provisions: It regulates and proscribes, with exceptions or qualifications to be discussed, performing the intact D &amp; E procedure.</p>\n<p>Respondents agree the Act encompasses intact D &amp; E, but they contend its additional reach is both unclear and excessive. Respondents assert that, at the least, the Act is void for vagueness because its scope is indefinite. In the alternative, respondents argue the Act's text proscribes all D &amp; Es. Because D &amp; E is the most common second-trimester abortion method, respondents suggest the Act imposes an undue burden. In this litigation the Attorney General does not dispute that the Act would impose an undue burden if it covered standard D &amp; E.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the Act is not void for vagueness, does not impose an undue burden from any overbreadth, and is not invalid on its face.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Act punishes \"knowingly perform[ing]\" a \"partial-birth abortion.\" \u00a7 1531(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). It defines the unlawful abortion in explicit terms. \u00a7 1531(b)(1).</p>\n<p>First, the person performing the abortion must \"vaginally delive[r] a living fetus.\" \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A). The Act does not restrict an abortion procedure involving the delivery of an expired fetus. The Act, furthermore, is inapplicable to abortions that do not involve vaginal delivery (for instance, hysterotomy or hysterectomy). The Act does apply both previability and postviability because, by common understanding and scientific terminology, a fetus is a living organism while within the womb, whether or not it is viable outside the womb. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 971-972. We do not understand this point to be contested by the parties.</p>\n<p>Second, the Act's definition of partial-birth abortion requires the fetus to be delivered \"until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother.\" \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The Attorney General concedes, and we agree, that if an abortion procedure does not involve the delivery of a living fetus to one of these \"anatomical `landmarks'\"\u0097where, depending on the presentation, either the fetal head or the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother\u0097the prohibitions of the Act do not apply. Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-380, p. 46.</p>\n<p>Third, to fall within the Act, a doctor must perform an \"overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus.\" \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(B) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). For purposes of criminal liability, the overt act causing the fetus' death must be separate from delivery. And the overt act must <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1628</span> occur after the delivery to an anatomical landmark. This is because the Act proscribes killing \"the partially delivered\" fetus, which, when read in context, refers to a fetus that has been delivered to an anatomical landmark. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Fourth, the Act contains scienter requirements concerning all the actions involved in the prohibited abortion. To begin with, the physician must have \"deliberately and intentionally\" delivered the fetus to one of the Act's anatomical landmarks. \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A). If a living fetus is delivered past the critical point by accident or inadvertence, the Act is inapplicable. In addition, the fetus must have been delivered \"for the purpose of performing an overt act that the [doctor] knows will kill [it].\" <i>Ibid.</i> If either intent is absent, no crime has occurred. This follows from the general principle that where scienter is required no crime is committed absent the requisite state of mind. See generally 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 5.1 (2d ed.2003) (hereinafter LaFave); 1 C. Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law \u00a7 27 (15th ed.1993).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondents contend the language described above is indeterminate, and they thus argue the Act is unconstitutionally vague on its face. \"As generally stated, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\" <i>Kolender v. Lawson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110926\"><a href=\"/opinion/110926/kolender-v-lawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983); <i>Posters `N' Things, Ltd. v.

The Act satisfies both requirements.</p>\n<p>The Act provides doctors \"of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.\" <i>Grayned v. City of Rockford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108598\"><a href=\"/opinion/108598/grayned-v-city-of-rockford/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). Indeed, it sets forth \"relatively clear guidelines as to prohibited conduct\" and provides \"objective criteria\" to evaluate whether a doctor has performed a prohibited procedure. <i>Posters `N' Things, supra,</i> at 525-526, 114 S.Ct. 1747. Unlike the statutory language in <i>Stenberg</i> that prohibited the delivery of a \"`substantial portion'\" of the fetus\u0097 where a doctor might question how much of the fetus is a substantial portion\u0097the Act defines the line between potentially criminal conduct on the one hand and lawful abortion on the other. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 922, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (quoting Neb. Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp.1999)). Doctors performing D &amp; E will know that if they do not deliver a living fetus to an anatomical landmark they will not face criminal liability.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is buttressed by the intent that must be proved to impose liability. The Court has made clear that scienter requirements alleviate vagueness concerns. <i>Posters `N' Things, supra,</i> at 526, 114 S.Ct. 1747; see also <i>Colautti v. Franklin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109966\"><a href=\"/opinion/109966/colautti-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span>, 395, 99 S.Ct. 675, 58 L.Ed.2d 596 (1979) (\"This Court has long recognized that the constitutionality of a vague statutory standard is closely related to whether that standard incorporates a requirement of <i>mens rea</i>\"). The Act requires the doctor deliberately to have delivered the fetus to an anatomical landmark. \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). Because a doctor performing a D &amp; E will not face criminal liability if he or she delivers a fetus beyond the prohibited point by mistake, the Act cannot be described as \"a trap for those who act in good faith.\" <i>Colautti, supra,</i> at 395, 99 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1629</span> S.Ct. 675 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Respondents likewise have failed to show that the Act should be invalidated on its face because it encourages arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. <i>Kolender, supra,</i> at 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855. Just as the Act's anatomical landmarks provide doctors with objective standards, they also \"establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\" <i>Smith v. Goguen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108988\"><a href=\"/opinion/108988/smith-v-goguen/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span>, 574, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974). The scienter requirements narrow the scope of the Act's prohibition and limit prosecutorial discretion. It cannot be said that the Act \"vests virtually complete discretion in the hands of [law enforcement] to determine whether the [doctor] has satisfied [its provisions].\" <i>Kolender, supra,</i> at 358, 103 S.Ct. 1855 (invalidating a statute regulating loitering). Respondents' arguments concerning arbitrary enforcement, furthermore, are somewhat speculative. This is a preenforcement challenge, where \"no evidence has been, or could be, introduced to indicate whether the [Act] has been enforced in a discriminatory manner or with the aim of inhibiting [constitutionally protected conduct].\" <i>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110661\"><a href=\"/opinion/110661/hoffman-estates-v-flipside-hoffman-estates-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span>, 503, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). The Act is not vague.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>We next determine whether the Act imposes an undue burden, as a facial matter, because its restrictions on second-trimester abortions are too broad. A review of the statutory text discloses the limits of its reach. The Act prohibits intact D &amp; E; and, notwithstanding respondents' arguments, it does not prohibit the D &amp; E procedure in which the fetus is removed in parts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>The Act prohibits a doctor from intentionally performing an intact D &amp; E. The dual prohibitions of the Act, both of which are necessary for criminal liability, correspond with the steps generally undertaken during this type of procedure. First, a doctor delivers the fetus until its head lodges in the cervix, which is usually past the anatomical landmark for a breech presentation. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). Second, the doctor proceeds to pierce the fetal skull with scissors or crush it with forceps. This step satisfies the overt-act requirement because it kills the fetus and is distinct from delivery. See \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(B). The Act's intent requirements, however, limit its reach to those physicians who carry out the intact D &amp; E after intending to undertake both steps at the outset.</p>\n<p>The Act excludes most D &amp; Es in which the fetus is removed in pieces, not intact. If the doctor intends to remove the fetus in parts from the outset, the doctor will not have the requisite intent to incur criminal liability. A doctor performing a standard D &amp; E procedure can often \"tak[e] about 10-15 `passes' through the uterus to remove the entire fetus.\" <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 962. Removing the fetus in this manner does not violate the Act because the doctor will not have delivered the living fetus to one of the anatomical landmarks or committed an additional overt act that kills the fetus after partial delivery. \u00a7 1531(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>A comparison of the Act with the Nebraska statute struck down in <i>Stenberg</i> confirms this point. The statute in <i>Stenberg</i> prohibited \"`deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1630</span> procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn child.'\" 530 U.S., at 922, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (quoting Neb.Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp.1999)). The Court concluded that this statute encompassed D &amp; E because \"D &amp; E will often involve a physician pulling a `substantial portion' of a still living fetus, say, an arm or leg, into the vagina prior to the death of the fetus.\" 530 U.S., at 939, 120 S.Ct. 2597. The Court also rejected the limiting interpretation urged by Nebraska's Attorney General that the statute's reference to a \"procedure\" that \"`kill[s] the unborn child'\" was to a distinct procedure, not to the abortion procedure as a whole. <i>Id.,</i> at 943, 120 S.Ct. 2597.</p>\n<p>Congress, it is apparent, responded to these concerns because the Act departs in material ways from the statute in <i>Stenberg.</i> It adopts the phrase \"delivers a living fetus,\" \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), instead of \"`delivering . . . a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof,'\" 530 U.S., at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (quoting Neb.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp.1999)). The Act's language, unlike the statute in <i>Stenberg,</i> expresses the usual meaning of \"deliver\" when used in connection with \"fetus,\" namely, extraction of an entire fetus rather than removal of fetal pieces. See Stedman's Medical Dictionary 470 (27th ed.2000) (defining deliver as \"[t]o assist a woman in childbirth\" and \"[t]o extract from an enclosed place, as the fetus from the womb, an object or foreign body\"); see also I. Dox, B. Melloni, G. Eisner, &amp; J. Melloni, The HarperCollins Illustrated Medical Dictionary 160 (4th ed.2001); Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 306 (10th ed.1997). The Act thus displaces the interpretation of \"delivering\" dictated by the Nebraska statute's reference to a \"substantial portion\" of the fetus. <i>Stenberg, supra,</i> at 944, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (indicating that the Nebraska \"statute itself specifies that it applies <i>both</i> to delivering `an intact unborn child' <i>or</i> `a substantial portion thereof'\"). In interpreting statutory texts courts use the ordinary meaning of terms unless context requires a different result. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:28 (rev. 6th ed.2000). Here, unlike in <i>Stenberg,</i> the language does not require a departure from the ordinary meaning. D &amp; E does not involve the delivery of a fetus because it requires the removal of fetal parts that are ripped from the fetus as they are pulled through the cervix.</p>\n<p>The identification of specific anatomical landmarks to which the fetus must be partially delivered also differentiates the Act from the statute at issue in <i>Stenberg.</i> \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The Court in <i>Stenberg</i> interpreted \"`substantial portion'\" of the fetus to include an arm or a leg. 530 U.S., at 939, 120 S.Ct. 2597. The Act's anatomical landmarks, by contrast, clarify that the removal of a small portion of the fetus is not prohibited. The landmarks also require the fetus to be delivered so that it is partially \"outside the body of the mother.\" \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A). To come within the ambit of the Nebraska statute, on the other hand, a substantial portion of the fetus only had to be delivered into the vagina; no part of the fetus had to be outside the body of the mother before a doctor could face criminal sanctions. <i>Id.,</i> at 938-939, 120 S.Ct. 2597.</p>\n<p>By adding an overt-act requirement Congress sought further to meet the Court's objections to the state statute considered in <i>Stenberg.</i> Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) with Neb. Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp.1999). The Act makes the distinction the Nebraska statute failed to draw (but the Nebraska Attorney General advanced) by differentiating between the overall partial-birth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1631</span> abortion and the distinct overt act that kills the fetus. See <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 943-944, 120 S.Ct. 2597. The fatal overt act must occur after delivery to an anatomical landmark, and it must be something \"other than [the] completion of delivery.\" \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(B). This distinction matters because, unlike intact D &amp; E, standard D &amp; E does not involve a delivery followed by a fatal act.</p>\n<p>The canon of constitutional avoidance, finally, extinguishes any lingering doubt as to whether the Act covers the prototypical D &amp; E procedure. \"`[T]he elementary rule is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.'\" <i>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112042\"><a href=\"/opinion/112042/edward-j-debartolo-corp-v-florida-gulf-coast-build/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 575, 108 S.Ct. 1392, 99 L.Ed.2d 645 (1988) (quoting <i>Hooper v.

It is true this longstanding maxim of statutory interpretation has, in the past, fallen by the wayside when the Court confronted a statute regulating abortion. The Court at times employed an antagonistic \"`canon of construction under which in cases involving abortion, a permissible reading of a statute [was] to be avoided at all costs.'\" <i>Stenberg, supra,</i> at 977, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (quoting <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U.S., at 829, 106 S.Ct. 2169 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)). <i>Casey</i> put this novel statutory approach to rest. <i>Stenberg, supra,</i> at 977, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). <i>Stenberg</i> need not be interpreted to have revived it. We read that decision instead to stand for the uncontroversial proposition that the canon of constitutional avoidance does not apply if a statute is not \"genuinely susceptible to two constructions.\" <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 238, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); see also <i>Clark v.

In <i>Stenberg</i> the Court found the statute covered D &amp; E. 530 U.S., at 938-945, 120 S.Ct. 2597. Here, by contrast, interpreting the Act so that it does not prohibit standard D &amp; E is the most reasonable reading and understanding of its terms.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Contrary arguments by the respondents are unavailing. Respondents look to situations that might arise during D &amp; E, situations not examined in <i>Stenberg.</i> They contend\u0097relying on the testimony of numerous abortion doctors\u0097that D &amp; E may result in the delivery of a living fetus beyond the Act's anatomical landmarks in a significant fraction of cases. This is so, respondents say, because doctors cannot predict the amount the cervix will dilate before the abortion procedure. It might dilate to a degree that the fetus will be removed largely intact. To complete the abortion, doctors will commit an overt act that kills the partially delivered fetus. Respondents thus posit that any D &amp; E has the potential to violate the Act, and that a physician will not know beforehand whether the abortion will proceed in a prohibited manner. Brief for Respondent Planned Parenthood et al. in No. 05-1382, p. 38.</p>\n<p>This reasoning, however, does not take account of the Act's intent requirements, which preclude liability from attaching to an accidental intact D &amp; E. If a doctor's intent at the outset is to perform a D &amp; E in which the fetus would not be delivered to either of the Act's anatomical landmarks, but the fetus nonetheless is delivered past one of those points, the requisite and prohibited scienter is not present. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). When a doctor in that situation completes an abortion by performing an intact <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1632</span> D &amp; E, the doctor does not violate the Act. It is true that intent to cause a result may sometimes be inferred if a person \"knows that that result is practically certain to follow from his conduct.\" 1 LaFave \u00a7 5.2(a), at 341. Yet abortion doctors intending at the outset to perform a standard D &amp; E procedure will not know that a prohibited abortion \"is practically certain to follow from\" their conduct. <i>Ibid.</i> A fetus is only delivered largely intact in a small fraction of the overall number of D &amp; E abortions. <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 965.</p>\n<p>The evidence also supports a legislative determination that an intact delivery is almost always a conscious choice rather than a happenstance. Doctors, for example, may remove the fetus in a manner that will increase the chances of an intact delivery. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. in No. 05-1382, at 74, 452. And intact D &amp; E is usually described as involving some manner of serial dilation. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Dilation and Extraction 110. Doctors who do not seek to obtain this serial dilation perform an intact D &amp; E on far fewer occasions. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 857-858 (\"In order for intact removal to occur on a regular basis, Dr. Fitzhugh would have to dilate his patients with a second round of laminaria\"). This evidence belies any claim that a standard D &amp; E cannot be performed without intending or foreseeing an intact D &amp; E.</p>\n<p>Many doctors who testified on behalf of respondents, and who objected to the Act, do not perform an intact D &amp; E by accident. On the contrary, they begin every D &amp; E abortion with the objective of removing the fetus as intact as possible. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 869 (\"Since Dr. Chasen believes that the intact D &amp; E is safer than the dismemberment D &amp; E, Dr. Chasen's goal is to perform an intact D &amp; E every time\"); see also <i>id.,</i> at 873, 886. This does not prove, as respondents suggest, that every D &amp; E might violate the Act and that the Act therefore imposes an undue burden. It demonstrates only that those doctors who intend to perform a D &amp; E that would involve delivery of a living fetus to one of the Act's anatomical landmarks must adjust their conduct to the law by not attempting to deliver the fetus to either of those points. Respondents have not shown that requiring doctors to intend dismemberment before delivery to an anatomical landmark will prohibit the vast majority of D &amp; E abortions. The Act, then, cannot be held invalid on its face on these grounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Under the principles accepted as controlling here, the Act, as we have interpreted it, would be unconstitutional \"if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\" <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). The abortions affected by the Act's regulations take place both previability and postviability; so the quoted language and the undue burden analysis it relies upon are applicable. The question is whether the Act, measured by its text in this facial attack, imposes a substantial obstacle to late-term, but previability, abortions. The Act does not on its face impose a substantial obstacle, and we reject this further facial challenge to its validity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Act's purposes are set forth in recitals preceding its operative provisions. A description of the prohibited abortion procedure demonstrates the rationale for the congressional enactment. The Act proscribes a method of abortion in which a fetus is killed just inches before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1633</span> completion of the birth process. Congress stated as follows: \"Implicitly approving such a brutal and inhumane procedure by choosing not to prohibit it will further coarsen society to the humanity of not only newborns, but all vulnerable and innocent human life, making it increasingly difficult to protect such life.\" Congressional Findings (14)(N), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769. The Act expresses respect for the dignity of human life.</p>\n<p>Congress was concerned, furthermore, with the effects on the medical community and on its reputation caused by the practice of partial-birth abortion. The findings in the Act explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Partial-birth abortion . . . confuses the medical, legal, and ethical duties of physicians to preserve and promote life, as the physician acts directly against the physical life of a child, whom he or she had just delivered, all but the head, out of the womb, in order to end that life.\" Congressional Findings (14)(J), <i>ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There can be no doubt the government \"has an interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession.\" <i>Washington v. Glucksberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118144\"><a href=\"/opinion/118144/washington-v-glucksberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span>, 731, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997); see also <i>Barsky v. Board of Regents of Univ. of N. Y.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105219\"><a href=\"/opinion/105219/barsky-v-board-of-regents-of-univ-of-ny/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span>, 451, 74 S.Ct. 650, 98 L.Ed. 829 (1954) (indicating the State has \"legitimate concern for maintaining high standards of professional conduct\" in the practice of medicine). Under our precedents it is clear the State has a significant role to play in regulating the medical profession.</p>\n<p><i>Casey</i> reaffirmed these governmental objectives. The government may use its voice and its regulatory authority to show its profound respect for the life within the woman. A central premise of the opinion was that the Court's precedents after <i>Roe</i> had \"undervalue[d] the State's interest in potential life.\" 505 U.S., at 873, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion); see also <i>id.,</i> at 871, 112 S.Ct. 2791. The plurality opinion indicated \"[t]he fact that a law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike at the right itself, has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 874, 112 S.Ct. 2791. This was not an idle assertion. The three premises of <i>Casey</i> must coexist. See <i>id.,</i> at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court). The third premise, that the State, from the inception of the pregnancy, maintains its own regulatory interest in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child, cannot be set at naught by interpreting <i>Casey's</i> requirement of a health exception so it becomes tantamount to allowing a doctor to choose the abortion method he or she might prefer. Where it has a rational basis to act, and it does not impose an undue burden, the State may use its regulatory power to bar certain procedures and substitute others, all in furtherance of its legitimate interests in regulating the medical profession in order to promote respect for life, including life of the unborn.</p>\n<p>The Act's ban on abortions that involve partial delivery of a living fetus furthers the Government's objectives. No one would dispute that, for many, D &amp; E is a procedure itself laden with the power to devalue human life. Congress could nonetheless conclude that the type of abortion proscribed by the Act requires specific regulation because it implicates additional ethical and moral concerns that justify a special prohibition. Congress determined that the abortion methods it proscribed had a \"disturbing similarity to the killing of a newborn infant,\" Congressional Findings (14)(L), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769, and thus it was concerned with \"draw[ing] a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1634</span> bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide.\" Congressional Findings (14)(G), <i>ibid.</i> The Court has in the past confirmed the validity of drawing boundaries to prevent certain practices that extinguish life and are close to actions that are condemned. <i>Glucksberg</i> found reasonable the State's \"fear that permitting assisted suicide will start it down the path to voluntary and perhaps even involuntary euthanasia.\" 521 U.S., at 732-735, and n. 23, 117 S.Ct. 2258.</p>\n<p>Respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in the bond of love the mother has for her child. The Act recognizes this reality as well. Whether to have an abortion requires a difficult and painful moral decision. <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 852-853, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court). While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained. See Brief for Sandra Cano et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> in No. 05-380, pp. 22-24. Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In a decision so fraught with emotional consequence some doctors may prefer not to disclose precise details of the means that will be used, confining themselves to the required statement of risks the procedure entails. From one standpoint this ought not to be surprising. Any number of patients facing imminent surgical procedures would prefer not to hear all details, lest the usual anxiety preceding invasive medical procedures become the more intense. This is likely the case with the abortion procedures here in issue. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 466, n. 22 (\"Most of [the plaintiffs'] experts acknowledged that they do not describe to their patients what [the D &amp; E and intact D &amp; E] procedures entail in clear and precise terms\"); see also <i>id.,</i> at 479.</p>\n<p>It is, however, precisely this lack of information concerning the way in which the fetus will be killed that is of legitimate concern to the State. <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 873, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion) (\"States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning\"). The State has an interest in ensuring so grave a choice is well informed. It is self-evident that a mother who comes to regret her choice to abort must struggle with grief more anguished and sorrow more profound when she learns, only after the event, what she once did not know: that she allowed a doctor to pierce the skull and vacuum the fast-developing brain of her unborn child, a child assuming the human form.</p>\n<p>It is a reasonable inference that a necessary effect of the regulation and the knowledge it conveys will be to encourage some women to carry the infant to full term, thus reducing the absolute number of late-term abortions. The medical profession, furthermore, may find different and less shocking methods to abort the fetus in the second trimester, thereby accommodating legislative demand. The State's interest in respect for life is advanced by the dialogue that better informs the political and legal systems, the medical profession, expectant mothers, and society as a whole of the consequences that follow from a decision to elect a late-term abortion.</p>\n<p>It is objected that the standard D &amp; E is in some respects as brutal, if not more, than the intact D &amp; E, so that the legislation accomplishes little. What we have already said, however, shows ample justification for the regulation. Partial-birth abortion, as defined by the Act, differs from a standard D &amp; E because the former <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1635</span> occurs when the fetus is partially outside the mother to the point of one of the Act's anatomical landmarks. It was reasonable for Congress to think that partial-birth abortion, more than standard D &amp; E, \"undermines the public's perception of the appropriate role of a physician during the delivery process, and perverts a process during which life is brought into the world.\" Congressional Findings (14)(K), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769. There would be a flaw in this Court's logic, and an irony in its jurisprudence, were we first to conclude a ban on both D &amp; E and intact D &amp; E was overbroad and then to say it is irrational to ban only intact D &amp; E because that does not proscribe both procedures. In sum, we reject the contention that the congressional purpose of the Act was \"to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.\" 505 U.S., at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Act's furtherance of legitimate government interests bears upon, but does not resolve, the next question: whether the Act has the effect of imposing an unconstitutional burden on the abortion right because it does not allow use of the barred procedure where \"`necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for [the] preservation of the . . . health of the mother.'\" <i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 327-328, 126 S.Ct. 961 (quoting <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 879, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion)). The prohibition in the Act would be unconstitutional, under precedents we here assume to be controlling, if it \"subject[ed] [women] to significant health risks.\" <i>Ayotte, supra,</i> at 328, 126 S.Ct. 961; see also <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 880, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court). In <i>Ayotte</i> the parties agreed a health exception to the challenged parental-involvement statute was necessary \"to avert serious and often irreversible damage to [a pregnant minor's] health.\" 546 U.S., at 328, 126 S.Ct. 961. Here, by contrast, whether the Act creates significant health risks for women has been a contested factual question. The evidence presented in the trial courts and before Congress demonstrates both sides have medical support for their position.</p>\n<p>Respondents presented evidence that intact D &amp; E may be the safest method of abortion, for reasons similar to those adduced in <i>Stenberg.</i> See 530 U.S., at 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597. Abortion doctors testified, for example, that intact D &amp; E decreases the risk of cervical laceration or uterine perforation because it requires fewer passes into the uterus with surgical instruments and does not require the removal of bony fragments of the dismembered fetus, fragments that may be sharp. Respondents also presented evidence that intact D &amp; E was safer both because it reduces the risks that fetal parts will remain in the uterus and because it takes less time to complete. Respondents, in addition, proffered evidence that intact D &amp; E was safer for women with certain medical conditions or women with fetuses that had certain anomalies. See, <i>e.g., Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-929; <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 470-474; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 982-983.</p>\n<p>These contentions were contradicted by other doctors who testified in the District Courts and before Congress. They concluded that the alleged health advantages were based on speculation without scientific studies to support them. They considered D &amp; E always to be a safe alternative. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 930-940; <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 470-474; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 983.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1636</span> There is documented medical disagreement whether the Act's prohibition would ever impose significant health risks on women. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 1033 (\"[T]here continues to be a division of opinion among highly qualified experts regarding the necessity or safety of intact D &amp; E\"); see also <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 482. The three District Courts that considered the Act's constitutionality appeared to be in some disagreement on this central factual question. The District Court for the District of Nebraska concluded \"the banned procedure is, sometimes, the safest abortion procedure to preserve the health of women.\" <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 1017, 120 S.Ct. 2597. The District Court for the Northern District of California reached a similar conclusion. <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 1002, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (finding intact D &amp; E was \"under certain circumstances . . . significantly safer than D &amp; E by disarticulation\"). The District Court for the Southern District of New York was more skeptical of the purported health benefits of intact D &amp; E. It found the Attorney General's \"expert witnesses reasonably and effectively refuted [the plaintiffs'] proffered bases for the opinion that [intact D &amp; E] has safety advantages over other second-trimester abortion procedures.\" <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 479. In addition it did \"not believe that many of [the plaintiffs'] purported reasons for why [intact D &amp; E] is medically necessary [were] credible; rather [it found them to be] theoretical or false.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 480. The court nonetheless invalidated the Act because it determined \"a significant body of medical opinion . . . holds that D &amp; E has safety advantages over induction and that [intact D &amp; E] has some safety advantages (however hypothetical and unsubstantiated by scientific evidence) over D &amp; E for some women in some circumstances.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The question becomes whether the Act can stand when this medical uncertainty persists. The Court's precedents instruct that the Act can survive this facial attack. The Court has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty. See <i>Kansas v.

Physicians are not entitled to ignore regulations that direct them to use reasonable alternative procedures. The law need not give abortion doctors unfettered choice in the course of their medical practice, nor should it elevate their status above other physicians in the medical community. In <i>Casey</i> the controlling opinion held an informed-consent requirement in the abortion context was \"no different from a requirement that a doctor give certain specific information about any medical procedure.\" 505 U.S., at 884, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (joint opinion). The opinion stated \"the doctor-patient relation here is entitled to the same solicitude it receives in other contexts.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>Webster v.

See <i>Hendricks, supra,</i> at 360, n. 3, 117 S.Ct. 2072. The medical uncertainty over whether the Act's prohibition creates significant health risks provides a sufficient basis to conclude in this facial attack that the Act does not impose an undue burden.</p>\n<p>The conclusion that the Act does not impose an undue burden is supported by other considerations. Alternatives are available to the prohibited procedure. As we have noted, the Act does not proscribe D &amp; E. One District Court found D &amp; E to have extremely low rates of medical complications. <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 1000, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Another indicated D &amp; E was \"generally the safest method of abortion during the second trimester.\" <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1031; see also <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 467-468 (explaining that \"[e]xperts testifying for both sides\" agreed D &amp; E was safe). In addition the Act's prohibition only applies to the delivery of \"a living fetus.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). If the intact D &amp; E procedure is truly necessary in some circumstances, it appears likely an injection that kills the fetus is an alternative under the Act that allows the doctor to perform the procedure.</p>\n<p>The instant cases, then, are different from <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109529\"><a href=\"/opinion/109529/planned-parenthood-of-central-mo-v-danforth/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 77-79, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976), in which the Court invalidated a ban on saline amniocentesis, the then-dominant second-trimester abortion method. The Court found the ban in <i>Danforth</i> to be \"an unreasonable or arbitrary regulation designed to inhibit, and having the effect of inhibiting, the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 79, 96 S.Ct. 2831. Here the Act allows, among other means, a commonly used and generally accepted method, so it does not construct a substantial obstacle to the abortion right.</p>\n<p>In reaching the conclusion the Act does not require a health exception we reject certain arguments made by the parties on both sides of these cases. On the one hand, the Attorney General urges us to uphold the Act on the basis of the congressional findings alone. Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-380, at 23. Although we review congressional factfinding under a deferential standard, we do not in the circumstances here place dispositive weight on Congress' findings. The Court retains an independent constitutional duty to review factual findings where constitutional rights are at stake. See <i>Crowell v. Benson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101864\"><a href=\"/opinion/101864/crowell-v-benson/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 60, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932) (\"In cases brought to enforce constitutional rights, the judicial power of the United States necessarily extends to the independent determination of all questions, both of fact and law, necessary to the performance of that supreme function\").</p>\n<p>As respondents have noted, and the District Courts recognized, some recitations in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1638</span> the Act are factually incorrect. See <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 482, 488-491. Whether or not accurate at the time, some of the important findings have been superseded. Two examples suffice. Congress determined no medical schools provide instruction on the prohibited procedure. Congressional Findings (14)(B), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769. The testimony in the District Courts, however, demonstrated intact D &amp; E is taught at medical schools. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 490; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1029. Congress also found there existed a medical consensus that the prohibited procedure is never medically necessary. Congressional Findings (1), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 767. The evidence presented in the District Courts contradicts that conclusion. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 1012-1015, 120 S.Ct. 2597; <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 488-489; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 1025-1026. Uncritical deference to Congress' factual findings in these cases is inappropriate.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, relying on the Court's opinion in <i>Stenberg,</i> respondents contend that an abortion regulation must contain a health exception \"if `substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular procedure could endanger women's health.'\" Brief for Respondents in No. 05-380, p. 19 (quoting 530 U.S., at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597); see also Brief for Respondent Planned Parenthood et al. in No. 05-1382, at 12 (same). As illustrated by respondents' arguments and the decisions of the Courts of Appeals, <i>Stenberg</i> has been interpreted to leave no margin of error for legislatures to act in the face of medical uncertainty. <i>Carhart,</i> 413 F.3d, at 796; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 435 F.3d, at 1173; see also <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 437 F.3d, at 296 (Walker, C. J., concurring) (explaining the standard under <i>Stenberg</i> \"is a virtually insurmountable evidentiary hurdle\").</p>\n<p>A zero tolerance policy would strike down legitimate abortion regulations, like the present one, if some part of the medical community were disinclined to follow the proscription. This is too exacting a standard to impose on the legislative power, exercised in this instance under the Commerce Clause, to regulate the medical profession. Considerations of marginal safety, including the balance of risks, are within the legislative competence when the regulation is rational and in pursuit of legitimate ends. When standard medical options are available, mere convenience does not suffice to displace them; and if some procedures have different risks than others, it does not follow that the State is altogether barred from imposing reasonable regulations. The Act is not invalid on its face where there is uncertainty over whether the barred procedure is ever necessary to preserve a woman's health, given the availability of other abortion procedures that are considered to be safe alternatives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>The considerations we have discussed support our further determination that these facial attacks should not have been entertained in the first instance. In these circumstances the proper means to consider exceptions is by as-applied challenge. The Government has acknowledged that preenforcement, as-applied challenges to the Act can be maintained.

This is the proper manner to protect the health of the woman if it can be shown that in discrete and well-defined instances a particular condition has or is likely to occur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must be used. In an as-applied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1639</span> challenge the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced than in a facial attack.</p>\n<p>The latitude given facial challenges in the First Amendment context is inapplicable here. Broad challenges of this type impose \"a heavy burden\" upon the parties maintaining the suit. <i>Rust v.

We note that the statute here applies to all instances in which the doctor proposes to use the prohibited procedure, not merely those in which the woman suffers from medical complications.

Responsive to that need, the Court endeavored to provide secure guidance to \"[s]tate and federal courts as well as legislatures throughout the Union,\" by defining \"the rights of the woman and the legitimate authority of the State respecting the termination of pregnancies by abortion procedures.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Taking care to speak plainly, the <i>Casey</i> Court restated and reaffirmed <i>Roe's</i> essential holding. 505 U.S., at 845-846, 112 S.Ct. 2791. First, the Court addressed the type of abortion regulation permissible prior to fetal viability. It recognized \"the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Second, the Court acknowledged \"the State's power to restrict abortions <i>after fetal viability,</i> if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life <i>or health.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Third, the Court confirmed that \"the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting <i>the health of the woman</i> and the life of the fetus that may become a child.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>In reaffirming <i>Roe,</i> the <i>Casey</i> Court described the centrality of \"the decision whether to bear . . . a child,\" <i>Eisenstadt v. Baird,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108489\"><a href=\"/opinion/108489/eisenstadt-v-baird/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span>, 453, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972), to a woman's \"dignity and autonomy,\" her \"personhood\" and \"destiny,\" her \"conception of . . . her place in society.\" 505 U.S., at 851-852, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Of signal importance here, the <i>Casey</i> Court stated with unmistakable clarity that state regulation of access to abortion procedures, even after viability, must protect \"the health of the woman.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791.</p>\n<p>Seven years ago, in <i>Stenberg v.

It refuses to take <i>Casey</i> and <i>Stenberg</i> seriously. It tolerates, indeed applauds, federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). It blurs the line, firmly drawn in <i>Casey,</i> between previability and postviability abortions. And, for the first time since <i>Roe,</i> the Court blesses a prohibition with no exception safeguarding a woman's health.</p>\n<p>I dissent from the Court's disposition. Retreating from prior rulings that abortion restrictions cannot be imposed absent an exception safeguarding a woman's health, the Court upholds an Act that surely would not survive under the close scrutiny that previously attended state-decreed limitations on a woman's reproductive choices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As <i>Casey</i> comprehended, at stake in cases challenging abortion restrictions is a woman's \"control over her [own] destiny.\" 505 U.S., at 869, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). See also <i>id.,</i> at 852, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (majority opinion).<sup>[2]</sup> \"There was a time, not so long ago,\" when women were \"regarded as the center of home and family life, with attendant special responsibilities that precluded full and independent legal status under the Constitution.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 896-897, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (quoting <i>Hoyt v. Florida,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106302\"><a href=\"/opinion/106302/hoyt-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 62, 82 S.Ct. 159, 7 L.Ed.2d 118 (1961)). Those views, this Court made clear in <i>Casey,</i> \"are no longer consistent with our understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution.\" 505 U.S., at 897, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Women, it is now acknowledged, have the talent, capacity, and right \"to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Their ability to realize their full potential, the Court recognized, is intimately connected to \"their ability to control their reproductive lives.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Thus, legal challenges to undue restrictions on abortion procedures do not seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy; rather, they center on a woman's autonomy to determine her life's course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Siegel, Reasoning from the Body: A Historical Perspective on Abortion Regulation and Questions of Equal Protection, 44 Stan. L.Rev. 261 (1992); Law, Rethinking Sex and the Constitution, 132 U. Pa. L.Rev. 955, 1002-1028 (1984).</p>\n<p>In keeping with this comprehension of the right to reproductive choice, the Court has consistently required that laws regulating abortion, at any stage of pregnancy and in all cases, safeguard a woman's health. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 327-328, 126 S.Ct. 961 (\"[O]ur precedents hold. . . that a State may not restrict access to abortions that are necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for preservation of the life or health of the [woman].\" (quoting <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 879, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion))); <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1642</span> 930, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (\"Since the law requires a health exception in order to validate even a postviability abortion regulation, it at a minimum requires the same in respect to previability regulation.\").

See <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109529\"><a href=\"/opinion/109529/planned-parenthood-of-central-mo-v-danforth/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 79, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976) (holding unconstitutional a ban on a method of abortion that \"force[d] a woman . . . to terminate her pregnancy by methods more dangerous to her health\"). See also <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 931, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (\"[Our cases] make clear that a risk to . . . women's health is the same whether it happens to arise from regulating a particular method of abortion, or from barring abortion entirely.\"). Indeed, we have applied the rule that abortion regulation must safeguard a woman's health to the particular procedure at issue here\u0097intact dilation and evacuation (D &amp; E).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Stenberg,</i> we expressly held that a statute banning intact D &amp; E was unconstitutional in part because it lacked a health exception. 530 U.S., at 930, 937, 120 S.Ct. 2597. We noted that there existed a \"division of medical opinion\" about the relative safety of intact D &amp; E, <i>id.,</i> at 937, 120 S.Ct. 2597, but we made clear that as long as \"substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular abortion procedure could endanger women's health,\" a health exception is required, <i>id.,</i> at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The word `necessary' in <i>Casey's</i> phrase `necessary, in appropriate medical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1643</span> judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the [pregnant woman],' cannot refer to an absolute necessity or to absolute proof. Medical treatments and procedures are often considered appropriate (or inappropriate) in light of estimated comparative health risks (and health benefits) in particular cases. Neither can that phrase require unanimity of medical opinion. Doctors often differ in their estimation of comparative health risks and appropriate treatment. And <i>Casey's</i> words `appropriate medical judgment' must embody the judicial need to tolerate responsible differences of medical opinion. . . .\" <i>Id.,</i> at 937, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, we reasoned, division in medical opinion \"at most means uncertainty, a factor that signals the presence of risk, not its absence.\" <i>Ibid.</i> \"[A] statute that altogether forbids [intact D &amp; E]. . . . consequently must contain a health exception.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597. See also <i>id.,</i> at 948, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"Th[e] lack of a health exception necessarily renders the statute unconstitutional.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In 2003, a few years after our ruling in <i>Stenberg,</i> Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act\u0097without an exception for women's health.

See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-928, 1025; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 471; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 982, 1001. <i>Second,</i> removing the fetus intact, instead of dismembering it <i>in utero,</i> decreases the likelihood that fetal tissue will be retained in the uterus, a condition that can cause infection, hemorrhage, and infertility. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-928, 1025-1026; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 472; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1001. <i>Third,</i> intact D &amp; E diminishes the chances of exposing the patient's tissues to sharp bony fragments sometimes resulting from dismemberment of the fetus. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-928, 1026; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 471; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1001. <i>Fourth,</i> intact D &amp; E takes less operating time than D &amp; E by dismemberment, and thus may reduce bleeding, the risk of infection, and complications relating to anesthesia. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-928, 1026; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 472; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1001.

See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1008-1027; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 482, 488-491; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1032. The trial courts concluded, in contrast to Congress' findings, that \"significant medical authority supports the proposition that in some circumstances, [intact D &amp; E] is the safest procedure.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1033 (quoting <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597); accord <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1008-1009, 1017-1018; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 480-482;<sup>[5]</sup> cf. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (\"[T]he record shows that significant medical authority supports the proposition that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1646</span> in some circumstances, [intact D &amp; E] would be the safest procedure.\").</p>\n<p>The District Courts' findings merit this Court's respect. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a); <i>Salve Regina College v. Russell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112564\"><a href=\"/opinion/112564/salve-regina-college-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 233, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991). Today's opinion supplies no reason to reject those findings. Nevertheless, despite the District Courts' appraisal of the weight of the evidence, and in undisguised conflict with <i>Stenberg,</i> the Court asserts that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act can survive \"when . . . medical uncertainty persists.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1636. This assertion is bewildering. Not only does it defy the Court's longstanding precedent affirming the necessity of a health exception, with no carve-out for circumstances of medical uncertainty, see <i>supra,</i> at 1641-1642; it gives short shrift to the records before us, carefully canvassed by the District Courts. Those records indicate that \"the majority of highly-qualified experts on the subject believe intact D &amp; E to be the safest, most appropriate procedure under certain circumstances.\" <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1034. See <i>supra,</i> at 1644-1645.</p>\n<p>The Court acknowledges some of this evidence, <i>ante,</i> at 1635, but insists that, because some witnesses disagreed with the ACOG and other experts' assessment of risk, the Act can stand. <i>Ante,</i> at 1635-1636, 1638-1639. In this insistence, the Court brushes under the rug the District Courts' well-supported findings that the physicians who testified that intact D &amp; E is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman had slim authority for their opinions. They had no training for, or personal experience with, the intact D &amp; E procedure, and many performed abortions only on rare occasions. See <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 980; <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1025; cf. <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 462-464. Even indulging the assumption that the Government witnesses were equally qualified to evaluate the relative risks of abortion procedures, their testimony could not erase the \"significant medical authority support[ing] the proposition that in some circumstances, [intact D &amp; E] would be the safest procedure.\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Court offers flimsy and transparent justifications for upholding a nationwide <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1647</span> ban on intact D &amp; E <i>sans</i> any exception to safeguard a women's health. Today's ruling, the Court declares, advances \"a premise central to [<i>Casey's</i>] conclusion\"\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> the Government's \"legitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1625-1626. See also <i>ante,</i> at 1626 (\"[W]e must determine whether the Act furthers the legitimate interest of the Government in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child.\"). But the Act scarcely furthers that interest: The law saves not a single fetus from destruction, for it targets only a <i>method</i> of performing abortion. See <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 930, 120 S.Ct. 2597. And surely the statute was not designed to protect the lives or health of pregnant women. <i>Id.,</i> at 951, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (GINSBURG, J., concurring); cf. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (recognizing along with the State's legitimate interest in the life of the fetus, its \"legitimate interes[t]. . . in protecting the <i>health of the woman</i>\" (emphasis added)). In short, the Court upholds a law that, while doing nothing to \"preserv[e] . . . fetal life,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1626, bars a woman from choosing intact D &amp; E although her doctor \"reasonably believes [that procedure] will best protect [her].\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 946, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (STEVENS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>As another reason for upholding the ban, the Court emphasizes that the Act does not proscribe the nonintact D &amp; E procedure. See <i>ante,</i> at 1637. But why not, one might ask. Nonintact D &amp; E could equally be characterized as \"brutal,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1633, involving as it does \"tear[ing] [a fetus] apart\" and \"ripp[ing] off\" its limbs, <i>ante,</i> at 1620-1621, 1621-1622. \"[T]he notion that either of these two equally gruesome procedures . . . is more akin to infanticide than the other, or that the State furthers any legitimate interest by banning one but not the other, is simply irrational.\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 946-947, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (STEVENS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Delivery of an intact, albeit nonviable, fetus warrants special condemnation, the Court maintains, because a fetus that is not dismembered resembles an infant. <i>Ante,</i> at 1633-1634. But so, too, does a fetus delivered intact after it is terminated by injection a day or two before the surgical evacuation, <i>ante,</i> at 1621, 1637-1638, or a fetus delivered through medical induction or cesarean, <i>ante,</i> at 1644. Yet, the availability of those procedures\u0097along with D &amp; E by dismemberment\u0097the Court says, saves the ban on intact D &amp; E from a declaration of unconstitutionality. <i>Ante,</i> at 1637-1638. Never mind that the procedures deemed acceptable might put a woman's health at greater risk. See <i>supra,</i> at 1646, and n. 6; cf. <i>ante,</i> at 1621, 1635-1636.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Court admits that \"moral concerns\" are at work, concerns that could yield prohibitions on any abortion. See <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634 (\"Congress could. . . conclude that the type of abortion proscribed by the Act requires specific regulation because it implicates additional ethical and moral concerns that justify a special prohibition.\"). Notably, the concerns expressed are untethered to any ground genuinely serving the Government's interest in preserving life. By allowing such concerns to carry the day and case, overriding fundamental rights, the Court dishonors our precedent. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 850, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (\"Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.\"); <i>Lawrence v.

See <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 869-870, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). \"[T]here is no line [more workable] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1650</span> than viability,\" the Court explained in <i>Casey,</i> for viability is \"the time at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing a life outside the womb, so that the independent existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman. . . . In some broad sense it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the State's intervention on behalf of the developing child.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 870, 112 S.Ct. 2791.</p>\n<p>Today, the Court blurs that line, maintaining that \"[t]he Act [legitimately] appl[ies] both previability and postviability because . . . a fetus is a living organism while within the womb, whether or not it is viable outside the womb.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1627. Instead of drawing the line at viability, the Court refers to Congress' purpose to differentiate \"abortion and infanticide\" based not on whether a fetus can survive outside the womb, but on where a fetus is anatomically located when a particular medical procedure is performed. See <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634 (quoting Congressional Findings (14)(G), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769).</p>\n<p>One wonders how long a line that saves no fetus from destruction will hold in face of the Court's \"moral concerns.\" See <i>supra,</i> at 1647; cf. <i>ante,</i> at 1627 (noting that \"[i]n this litigation\" the Attorney General \"does not dispute that the Act would impose an undue burden if it covered standard D &amp; E\"). The Court's hostility to the right <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> secured is not concealed. Throughout, the opinion refers to obstetrician-gynecologists and surgeons who perform abortions not by the titles of their medical specialties, but by the pejorative label \"abortion doctor.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1625, 1631, 1632, 1635, 1636. A fetus is described as an \"unborn child,\" and as a \"baby,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1620, 1622-1623; second-trimester, previability abortions are referred to as \"late-term,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1632; and the reasoned medical judgments of highly trained doctors are dismissed as \"preferences\" motivated by \"mere convenience,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1620, 1638. Instead of the heightened scrutiny we have previously applied, the Court determines that a \"rational\" ground is enough to uphold the Act, <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634, 1638. And, most troubling, <i>Casey's</i> principles, confirming the continuing vitality of \"the essential holding of <i>Roe,</i>\" are merely \"assume[d]\" for the moment, <i>ante,</i> at 1626, 1635, rather than \"retained\" or \"reaffirmed,\" <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Court further confuses our jurisprudence when it declares that \"facial attacks\" are not permissible in \"these circumstances,\" <i>i.e.,</i> where medical uncertainty exists. <i>Ante,</i> at 1638; see <i>ibid.</i> (\"In an as-applied challenge the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced than in a facial attack.\"). This holding is perplexing given that, in materially identical circumstances we held that a statute lacking a health exception was unconstitutional on its face. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 930, 120 S.Ct. 2597; see <i>id.,</i> at 937, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (in facial challenge, law held unconstitutional because \"significant body of medical opinion believes [the] procedure may bring with it greater safety for <i>some patients</i>\" (emphasis added)).

But <i>Casey</i> makes clear that, in determining whether any restriction poses an undue burden on a \"large fraction\" of women, the relevant class is <i>not</i> \"all women,\" nor \"all pregnant women,\" nor even all women \"seeking abortions.\" 505 U.S., at 895, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Rather, a provision restricting access to abortion, \"must be judged by reference to those [women] for whom it is an actual rather than an irrelevant restriction,\" <i>ibid.</i> Thus the absence of a health exception burdens <i>all</i> women for whom it is relevant\u0097women who, in the judgment of their doctors, require an intact D &amp; E because other procedures would place their health at risk.<sup>[10]</sup> Cf. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 934, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (accepting the \"relative rarity\" of medically indicated intact D &amp; Es as true but not \"highly relevant\"\u0097for \"the health exception question is whether protecting women's health requires an exception for those infrequent occasions\"); <i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 328, 126 S.Ct. 961 (facial challenge entertained where \"[i]n some very small percentage of cases ... women ... need immediate abortions to avert serious, and often irreversible damage to their health\"). It makes no sense to conclude that this facial challenge fails because respondents have not shown that a health exception is necessary for a large fraction of second-trimester abortions, including those for which a health exception is unnecessary: The very purpose of a health <i>exception</i> is to protect women in <i>exceptional</i> cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>If there is anything at all redemptive to be said of today's opinion, it is that the Court is not willing to foreclose entirely a constitutional challenge to the Act. \"The Act is open,\" the Court states, \"to a proper as-applied challenge in a discrete case.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1639; see <i>ante,</i> at 1639 (\"The Government has acknowledged that preenforcement, as-applied challenges to the Act can be maintained.\"). But the Court offers no clue on what a \"proper\" lawsuit might look like. See <i>ante,</i> at 1638-1639. Nor does the Court explain why the injunctions ordered by the District Courts should not remain in place, trimmed only to exclude instances in which another procedure would safeguard a woman's health at least equally well. Surely the Court cannot mean that no suit may be brought until a woman's health is immediately jeopardized by the ban on intact D &amp; E. A woman \"suffer[ing] from medical complications,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1639, needs access to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1652</span> medical procedure at once and cannot wait for the judicial process to unfold. See <i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 328, 126 S.Ct. 961.</p>\n<p>The Court appears, then, to contemplate another lawsuit by the initiators of the instant actions. In such a second round, the Court suggests, the challengers could succeed upon demonstrating that \"in discrete and well-defined instances a particular condition has or is likely to occur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must be used.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1638. One may anticipate that such a preenforcement challenge will be mounted swiftly, to ward off serious, sometimes irremediable harm, to women whose health would be endangered by the intact D &amp; E prohibition.</p>\n<p>The Court envisions that in an as-applied challenge, \"the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced.\" <i>Ibid.</i> But it should not escape notice that the record already includes hundreds and hundreds of pages of testimony identifying \"discrete and well-defined instances\" in which recourse to an intact D &amp; E would better protect the health of women with particular conditions. See <i>supra,</i> at 1644-1645. Record evidence also documents that medical exigencies, unpredictable in advance, may indicate to a well-trained doctor that intact D &amp; E is the safest procedure. See ibid. In light of this evidence, our unanimous decision just one year ago in <i>Ayotte</i> counsels against reversal. See 546 U.S., at 331, 126 S.Ct. 961 (remanding for reconsideration of the remedy for the absence of a health exception, suggesting that an injunction prohibiting unconstitutional applications might suffice).</p>\n<p>The Court's allowance only of an \"as-applied challenge in a discrete case,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1639\u0097jeopardizes women's health and places doctors in an untenable position. Even if courts were able to carve-out exceptions through piecemeal litigation for \"discrete and well-defined instances,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1638, women whose circumstances have not been anticipated by prior litigation could well be left unprotected. In treating those women, physicians would risk criminal prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment if they exercise their best judgment as to the safest medical procedure for their patients. The Court is thus gravely mistaken to conclude that narrow as-applied challenges are \"the proper manner to protect the health of the woman.\" Cf. <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>As the Court wrote in <i>Casey,</i> \"overruling <i>Roe's</i> central holding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under principles of <i>stare decisis,</i> but would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law.\" 505 U.S., at 865, 112 S.Ct. 2791. \"[T]he very concept of the rule of law underlying our own Constitution requires such continuity over time that a respect for precedent is, by definition, indispensable.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 854, 112 S.Ct. 2791. See also <i>id.,</i> at 867, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (\"[T]o overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to reexamine a watershed decision would subvert the Court's legitimacy beyond any serious question.\").</p>\n<p>Though today's opinion does not go so far as to discard <i>Roe</i> or <i>Casey,</i> the Court, differently composed than it was when we last considered a restrictive abortion regulation, is hardly faithful to our earlier invocations of \"the rule of law\" and the \"principles of <i>stare decisis.</i>\" Congress imposed a ban despite our clear prior holdings that the State cannot proscribe an abortion procedure when its use is necessary to protect a woman's health. See <i>supra,</i> at 1643, n. 4. Although Congress' findings could not withstand the crucible of trial, the Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1653</span> defers to the legislative override of our Constitution-based rulings. See <i>supra,</i> at 1643-1644. A decision so at odds with our jurisprudence should not have staying power.</p>\n<p>In sum, the notion that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act furthers any legitimate governmental interest is, quite simply, irrational. The Court's defense of the statute provides no saving explanation. In candor, the Act, and the Court's defense of it, cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away at a right declared again and again by this Court\u0097 and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women's lives. See <i>supra,</i> at 1641, n. 2; <i>supra,</i> at 1643, n. 4. When \"a statute burdens constitutional rights and all that can be said on its behalf is that it is the vehicle that legislators have chosen for expressing their hostility to those rights, the burden is undue.\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 952, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (quoting <i>Hope Clinic v.

See <i>Planned Parenthood Federation of Am. v. Ashcroft,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d 957, 964 (N.D.Cal.2004), aff'd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793122\"><a href=\"/opinion/793122/planned-parenthood-federation-of-america-inc-plann/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1163</span></a></span> (C.A.9 2006). The medical community refers to the procedure as either dilation &amp; extraction (D &amp; X) or intact dilation and evacuation (intact D &amp; E). See, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 1621; <i>Stenberg v.

See <i>ante,</i> at 1620-1621, 1621-1622; <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 924, 927, 120 S.Ct. 2597; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 966. Second-trimester abortions (<i>i.e.,</i> midpregnancy, previability abortions) are, however, relatively uncommon. Between 85 and 90 percent of all abortions performed in the United States take place during the first three months of pregnancy. See <i>ante,</i> at 1620. See also <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 923-927, 120 S.Ct. 2597; <i>National Abortion Federation v.

Minors may be unaware they are pregnant until relatively late in pregnancy, while poor women's financial constraints are an obstacle to timely receipt of services. See Finer, Frohwirth, Dauphinee, Singh, &amp; Moore, Timing of Steps and Reasons for Delays in Obtaining Abortions in the United States, 74 Contraception 334, 341-343 (2006). See also Drey et al., Risk Factors Associated with Presenting for Abortion in the Second Trimester, 107 Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 128, 133 (Jan.2006) (concluding that women who have second-trimester abortions typically discover relatively late that they are pregnant). Severe fetal anomalies and health problems confronting the pregnant woman are also causes of second-trimester abortions; many such conditions cannot be diagnosed or do not develop until the second trimester. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Finer, <i>supra,</i> at 344; F. Cunningham et al., Williams Obstetrics 242, 290, 328-329, (22d ed.2005); cf. Schechtman, Gray, Baty, &amp; Rothman, Decision-Making for Termination of Pregnancies with Fetal Anomalies: Analysis of 53,000 Pregnancies, 99 Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 216, 220-221 (Feb.2002) (nearly all women carrying fetuses with the most serious central nervous system anomalies chose to abort their pregnancies).</p>\n<p>[4]  The Act's sponsors left no doubt that their intention was to nullify our ruling in <i>Stenberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118387\"><a href=\"/opinion/118387/stenberg-v-carhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2597, 147 L.Ed.2d 743. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 149 Cong. Rec. 5731 (2003) (statement of Sen. Santorum) (\"Why are we here? We are here because the Supreme Court defended the indefensible. . . . We have responded to the Supreme Court.\"). See also 148 Cong. Rec. 14273 (2002) (statement of Rep. Linder) (rejecting proposition that Congress has \"no right to legislate a ban on this horrible practice because the Supreme Court says [it] cannot\").</p>\n<p>[5]  Even the District Court for the Southern District of New York, which was more skeptical of the health benefits of intact D &amp; E, see <i>ante,</i> at 1635-1636, recognized: \"[T]he Government's own experts disagreed with almost all of Congress's factual findings\"; a \"significant body of medical opinion\" holds that intact D &amp; E has safety advantages over nonintact D &amp; E; \"[p]rofessional medical associations have also expressed their view that [intact D &amp; E] may be the safest procedure for some women\"; and \"[t]he evidence indicates that the same disagreement among experts found by the Supreme Court in <i>Stenberg</i> existed throughout the time that Congress was considering the legislation, despite Congress's findings to the contrary.\" <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 480-482.</p>\n<p>[6]  The majority contends that \"[i]f the intact D &amp; E procedure is truly necessary in some circumstances, it appears likely an injection that kills the fetus is an alternative under the Act that allows the doctor to perform the procedure.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1637-1638. But a \"significant body of medical opinion believes that inducing fetal death by injection is almost always inappropriate to the preservation of the health of women undergoing abortion because it poses tangible risk and provides no benefit to the woman.\" <i>Carhart v. Ashcroft,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d 805, 1028 (Neb.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), aff'd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790868\"><a href=\"/opinion/790868/leroy-carhart-md-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-the-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span> (C.A.8 2005). In some circumstances, injections are \"absolutely [medically] contraindicated.\" 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1027. See also <i>id.,</i> at 907-912; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 474-475; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 995-997. The Court also identifies medical induction of labor as an alternative. See <i>ante,</i> at 1644. That procedure, however, requires a hospital stay, <i>ibid.,</i> rendering it inaccessible to patients who lack financial resources, and it too is considered less safe for many women, and impermissible for others. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 940-949, 1017; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 468-470; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 961, n. 5, 992-994, 1000-1002.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Court is surely correct that, for most women, abortion is a painfully difficult decision. See <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634. But \"neither the weight of the scientific evidence to date nor the observable reality of 33 years of legal abortion in the United States comports with the idea that having an abortion is any more dangerous to a woman's long-term mental health than delivering and parenting a child that she did not intend to have. . . .\" Cohen, Abortion and Mental Health: Myths and Realities, 9 Guttmacher Policy Rev. 8 (2006); see generally Bazelon, Is There a Post-Abortion Syndrome? N.Y. Times Magazine, Jan. 21, 2007, p. 40. See also, <i>e.g.,</i> American Psychological Association, APA Briefing Paper on the Impact of Abortion (2005) (rejecting theory of a postabortion syndrome and stating that \"[a]ccess to legal abortion to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is vital to safeguard both the physical and mental health of women\"); Schmiege &amp; Russo, Depression and Unwanted First Pregnancy: Longitudinal Cohort Study, 331 British Medical J. 1303 (2005) (finding no credible evidence that choosing to terminate an unwanted first pregnancy contributes to risk of subsequent depression); Gilchrist, Hannaford, Frank, &amp; Kay, Termination of Pregnancy and Psychiatric Morbidity, 167 British J. of Psychiatry 243, 247-248 (1995) (finding, in a cohort of more than 13,000 women, that the rate of psychiatric disorder was no higher among women who terminated pregnancy than among those who carried pregnancy to term); Stodland, The Myth of the Abortion Trauma Syndrome, 268 JAMA 2078, 2079 (1992) (\"Scientific studies indicate that legal abortion results in fewer deleterious sequelae for women compared with other possible outcomes of unwanted pregnancy. There is no evidence of an abortion trauma syndrome.\"); American Psychological Association, Council Policy Manual: (N)(I)(3), Public Interest (1989) (declaring assertions about widespread severe negative psychological effects of abortion to be \"without fact\"). But see Cougle, Reardon, &amp; Coleman, Generalized Anxiety Following Unintended Pregnancies Resolved Through Childbirth and Abortion: A Cohort Study of the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth, 19 J. Anxiety Disorders 137, 142 (2005) (advancing theory of a postabortion syndrome but acknowledging that \"no causal relationship between pregnancy outcome and anxiety could be determined\" from study); Reardon et al., Psychiatric Admissions of Low-Income Women following Abortion and Childbirth, 168 Canadian Medical Assn. J. 1253, 1255-1256 (May 13, 2003) (concluding that psychiatric admission rates were higher for women who had an abortion compared with women who delivered); cf. Major, Psychological Implications of Abortion\u0097Highly Charged and Rife with Misleading Research, 168 Canadian Medical Assn. J. 1257, 1258 (May 13, 2003) (critiquing Reardon study for failing to control for a host of differences between women in the delivery and abortion samples).</p>\n<p>[8]  Notwithstanding the \"bond of love\" women often have with their children, see <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634, not all pregnancies, this Court has recognized, are wanted, or even the product of consensual activity. See <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 891, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (\"[O]n an average day in the United States, nearly 11,000 women are severely assaulted by their male partners. Many of these incidents involve sexual assault.\"). See also Glander, Moore, Michielutte, &amp; Parsons, The Prevalence of Domestic Violence Among Women Seeking Abortion, 91 Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 1002 (1998); Holmes, Resnick, Kilpatrick, &amp; Best, Rape-Related Pregnancy; Estimates and Descriptive Characteristics from a National Sample of Women, 175 Am. J. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 320 (Aug. 1996).</p>\n<p>[9]  Eliminating or reducing women's reproductive choices is manifestly <i>not</i> a means of protecting them. When safe abortion procedures cease to be an option, many women seek other means to end unwanted or coerced pregnancies. See, <i>e.g.,</i> World Health Organization, Unsafe Abortion: Global and Regional Estimates of the Incidence of Unsafe Abortion and Associated Mortality in 2000, pp. 3, 16 (4th ed. 2004) (\"Restrictive legislation is associated with a high incidence of unsafe abortion\" worldwide; unsafe abortion represents 13% of all \"maternal\" deaths); Henshaw, Unintended Pregnancy and Abortion: A Public Health Perspective, in A Clinician's Guide to Medical and Surgical Abortion 11, 19 (M. Paul, E. Lichtenberg, L. Borgatta, D. Grimes, &amp; P. Stubblefield eds. 1999) (\"Before legalization, large numbers of women in the United States died from unsafe abortions.\"); H. Boonstra, R. Gold, C. Richards, &amp; L. Finer, Abortion in Women's Lives 13, and fig. 2.2 (2006) (\"as late as 1965, illegal abortion still accounted for an estimated . . . 17% of all officially reported pregnancy-related deaths\"; \"[d]eaths from abortion declined dramatically after legalization\").</p>\n<p>[10]  There is, in short, no fraction because the numerator and denominator are the same: The health exception reaches only those cases where a woman's health is at risk. Perhaps for this reason, in mandating safeguards for women's health, we have never before invoked the \"large fraction\" test.</p>\n\n</div>",
