The NSPS provisions define the term \"modification,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(a)(4), while the PSD provisions use that word \"as defined in\" NSPS, \u00a7 7479(2)(C). The Court of Appeals concluded that the statute requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conform its PSD regulations on \"modification\" to their NSPS counterparts, and that EPA's 1980 PSD regulations can be given this conforming construction. We hold that the Court of Appeals's reading of the 1980 PSD regulations, intended to align them with NSPS, was inconsistent with their terms and effectively invalidated them; any such result must be shown to comport with the Act's restrictions on judicial review of EPA regulations for validity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1676, broadened federal authority to combat air pollution, see <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 845-846, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), and directed EPA to devise National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) limiting various pollutants, which the States were obliged to implement and enforce, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7409, 7410. The amendments dealing with NSPS authorized EPA to require operators of stationary sources of air pollutants to use the best technology for limiting pollution, <i>Chevron, supra,</i> at 846, 104 S.Ct. 2778; see also 1 F. Grad, Environmental Law \u00a7 2.03, p. 2-356 (2006), both in newly constructed sources and those undergoing \"modification,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(a)(2). Section 111(a) of the 1970 amendments defined this term within the NSPS scheme as \"any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(a)(4).</p>\n<p>EPA's 1975 regulations implementing NSPS provided generally that \"any physical or operational change to an existing facility which results in an increase in the emission rate to the atmosphere of any pollutant to which a standard applies shall be considered a modification within the meaning of [S]ection 111.\" 40 CFR \u00a7 60.14(a) (1976). Especially significant here is the identification of an NSPS \"modification\" as a change that \"increase[s]. . . the emission rate,\" which \"shall be expressed as kg/hr of any pollutant discharged into the atmosphere.\" \u00a7 60.14(b).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1429</span> NSPS, however, did too little to \"achiev[e] the ambitious goals of the 1970 Amendments,\" R. Belden, Clean Air Act 7 (2001) (hereinafter Belden), and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, 91 Stat. 685, included the PSD provisions, which aimed at giving added protection to air quality in certain parts of the country \"notwithstanding attainment and maintenance of\" the NAAQS. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7470(1).<sup>[2]</sup> The 1977 amendments required a PSD permit before a \"major emitting facility\" could be \"constructed\" in an area covered by the scheme. \u00a7 7475(a). As originally enacted, PSD applied only to newly constructed sources, but soon a technical amendment added the following subparagraph: \"The term `construction' when used in connection with any source or facility, includes the modification (as defined in [S]ection 111(a)) of any source or facility.\" \u00a7 14(a)(54), 91 Stat. 1402, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(2)(C); see also <i>New York v. EPA,</i> 413 F.3d 3, 13 (C.A.D.C.2005). In other words, the \"construction\" requiring a PSD permit under the statute was made to include (though it was not limited to) a \"modification\" as defined in the statutory NSPS provisions.</p>\n<p>In 1980, EPA issued PSD regulations,<sup>[3]</sup> which \"limited the application of [PSD] review\" of modified sources to instances of \"`major' modificatio[n],\" Belden 46, defined as \"any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that would result in a significant net emissions increase of any pollutant subject to regulation under the Act.\" 40 CFR \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i) (1987). Further regulations in turn addressed various elements of this definition, three of which are to the point here. First, the regulations specified that an operational change consisting merely of \"[a]n increase in the hours of operation or in the production rate\" would not generally constitute a \"physical change or change in the method of operation.\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(iii)(<i>f</i>). For purposes of a PSD permit, that is, such an operational change would not amount to a \"modification\" as the Act defines it. Second, the PSD regulations defined a \"net emissions increase\" as \"[a]ny increase in actual emissions from a particular physical change or change in the method of operation,\" net of other contemporaneous \"increases and decreases in actual emissions at the source.\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(3). \"Actual emissions\" were defined to \"equal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a two-year period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation.\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(21)(ii). \"[A]ctual emissions\" were to be \"calculated using the unit's actual operating hours [and] production rates.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Third, the term \"significant\" was defined as \"a rate of emissions that would equal or exceed\" one or another enumerated threshold, each expressed in \"tons per year.\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(23)(i).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1430</span> It would be bold to try to synthesize these statutory and regulatory provisions in a concise paragraph, but three points are relatively clear about the regime that covers this case:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) The Act defines modification of a stationary source of a pollutant as a physical change to it, or a change in the method of its operation, that increases the amount of a pollutant discharged or emits a new one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) EPA's NSPS regulations require a source to use the best available pollution-limiting technology only when a modification would increase the rate of discharge of pollutants measured in kilograms per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(c) EPA's 1980 PSD regulations require a permit for a modification (with the same statutory definition) only when it is a major one and only when it would increase the actual annual emission of a pollutant above the actual average for the two prior years.</blockquote>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held that Congress's provision defining a PSD modification by reference to an NSPS modification caught not only the statutory NSPS definition, but also whatever regulatory gloss EPA puts on that definition at any given time (for the purposes of the best technology requirement). When, therefore, EPA's PSD regulations specify the \"change\" that amounts to a \"major modification\" requiring a PSD permit, they must measure an increase in \"the amount of any air pollutant emitted,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(a)(4), in terms of the hourly rate of discharge, just the way NSPS regulations do. Petitioners and the United States say, on the contrary, that when EPA addresses the object of the PSD scheme it is free to put a different regulatory interpretation on the common statutory core of \"modification,\" by measuring increased emission not in terms of hourly rate but by the actual, annual discharge of a pollutant that will follow the modification, regardless of rate per hour. This disagreement is the nub of the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Respondent Duke Energy Corporation runs 30 coal-fired electric generating units at eight plants in North and South Carolina. <i>United States v. Duke Energy Corp.,</i> 411 F.3d 539, 544 (C.A.4 2005). The units were placed in service between 1940 and 1975, and each includes a boiler containing thousands of steel tubes arranged in sets. <i>Ibid.</i> Between 1988 and 2000,<sup>[4]</sup> Duke replaced or redesigned 29 tube assemblies in order to extend the life of the units and allow them to run longer each day. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The United States filed this action in 2000, claiming, among other things, that Duke violated the PSD provisions by doing this work without permits. Environmental Defense, North Carolina Sierra Club, and North Carolina Public Interest Research Group Citizen Lobby/Education Fund intervened as plaintiffs and filed a complaint charging similar violations.</p>\n<p>Duke moved for summary judgment, one of its positions being that none of the projects was a \"major modification\" requiring <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1431</span> a PSD permit because none increased hourly rates of emissions. The District Court agreed with Duke's reading of the 1980 PSD regulations. It reasoned that their express exclusion of \"[a]n increase in the hours of operation\" from the definition of a \"physical change or change in the method of operation\" implied that \"post-project emissions levels must be calculated assuming\" preproject hours of operation. 278 F.Supp.2d 619, 640-641 (M.D.N.C.2003). Consequently, the District Court said, a PSD \"major modification\" can occur \"only if the project increases the hourly rate of emissions.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 641. The District Court found further support for its construction of the 1980 PSD regulations in one letter and one memorandum written in 1981 by EPA's Director of the Division of Stationary Source Enforcement, Edward E. Reich. <i>Id.,</i> at 641-642.</p>\n<p>The United States and intervenor-plaintiffs (collectively, plaintiffs) subsequently stipulated \"that they do not contend that the projects at issue in this case caused an increase in the maximum hourly rate of emissions at any of Duke Energy's units.\" App. 504. Rather, their claim \"is based solely on their contention that the projects would have been projected to result in an increased utilization of the units at issue.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Duke, for its part, stipulated to plaintiffs' right to appeal the District Court's determination that projects resulting in greater operating hours are not \"major modifications\" triggering the PSD permit requirement, absent an increase in the hourly rate of emissions. The District Court then entered summary judgment for Duke on all PSD claims.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, \"albeit for somewhat different reasons.\" 411 F.3d, at 542. \"[T]he language and various interpretations of the PSD regulations . . . are largely irrelevant to the proper analysis of this case,\" reasoned the Court of Appeals, \"because Congress' decision to create identical statutory definitions of the term `modification'\" in the NSPS and PSD provisions of the Clean Air Act \"has affirmatively mandated that this term be interpreted identically\" in the regulations promulgated under those provisions. <i>Id.,</i> at 547, n. 3, 550. The Court of Appeals relied principally on the authority of <i>Rowan Cos. v. United States,</i> 452 U.S. 247, 250, 101 S.Ct. 2288, 68 L.Ed.2d 814 (1981), where we held against the Government's differing interpretations of the word \"wages\" in different tax provisions. 411 F.3d, at 550. As the Court of Appeals saw it, <i>Rowan</i> establishes an \"effectively irrebuttable\" presumption that PSD regulations must contain the same conditions for a \"modification\" as the NSPS regulations, including an increase in the hourly rate of emissions.<sup>[5]</sup> 411 F.3d, at 550.</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals said, Duke had not initially relied on <i>Rowan,</i> see 411 F.3d, at 547, n. 4, and when the Court <i>sua sponte</i> requested supplemental briefing on <i>Rowan's</i> relevance, plaintiffs injected a new issue into the case. They argued that a claim that the 1980 PSD regulation exceeded statutory authority would be an attack on the validity of the regulation that could not be raised in an enforcement proceeding. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(2). Under \u00a7 307(b) of the Act, they said, judicial review for validity can be obtained only by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1432</span> a petition to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, generally within 60 days of EPA's rulemaking. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals rejected this argument. \"Our choice of this interpretation of the PSD regulations . . . is not an invalidation of those regulations,\" it said, because \"the PSD regulations can be interpreted\" to require an increase in the hourly emissions rate as an element of a major \"modification\" triggering the permit requirement. 411 F.3d, at 549, n. 7. To show that the 1980 PSD regulations are open to this construction, the Court of Appeals cited the conclusions of the District Court and the Reich opinions.</p>\n<p>We granted the petition for certiorari brought by intervenor-plaintiffs, 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2019, 164 L.Ed.2d 778 (2006), and now vacate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals understood that it was simply construing EPA's 1980 PSD regulations in a permissible way that left them in harmony with their NSPS counterpart and, hence, the Act's single definition of \"modification.\" The plaintiffs say that the Court of Appeals was rewriting the PSD regulations in a way neither required by the Act nor consistent with their own text.</p>\n<p>It is true that no precise line runs between a purposeful but permissible reading of the regulation adopted to bring it into harmony with the Court of Appeals's view of the statute, and a determination that the regulation as written is invalid. But the latter occurred here, for the Court of Appeals's efforts to trim the PSD regulations to match their different NSPS counterparts can only be seen as an implicit declaration that the PSD regulations were invalid as written.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In applying the 1980 PSD regulations to Duke's conduct, the Court of Appeals thought that, by defining the term \"modification\" identically in its NSPS and PSD provisions, the Act required EPA to conform its PSD interpretation of that definition to any such interpretation it reasonably adhered to under NSPS. But principles of statutory construction are not so rigid. Although we presume that the same term has the same meaning when it occurs here and there in a single statute, the Court of Appeals mischaracterized that presumption as \"effectively irrebuttable.\" 411 F.3d, at 550. We also understand that \"[m]ost words have different shades of meaning and consequently may be variously construed, not only when they occur in different statutes, but when used more than once in the same statute or even in the same section.\" <i>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc. v. United States,</i> 286 U.S. 427, 433, 52 S.Ct. 607, 76 L.Ed. 1204 (1932). Thus, the \"natural presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning . . . is not rigid and readily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent.\" <i>Ibid.</i> A given term in the same statute may take on distinct characters from association with distinct statutory objects calling for different implementation strategies.</p>\n<p>The point is the same even when the terms share a common statutory definition, if it is general enough, as we recognized in <i>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> 519 U.S. 337, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997). There the question was whether the term \"employees\" in \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 covered former employees. Title VII expressly defined <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1433</span> the term \"employee,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(f), but the definition was \"consistent with either current or past employment,\" 519 U.S., at 342, 117 S.Ct. 843, and we held that \"each section\" of Title VII \"must be analyzed to determine whether the context gives the term a further meaning that would resolve the issue in dispute,\" <i>id.,</i> at 343-344, 117 S.Ct. 843.</p>\n<p>If <i>Robinson</i> were inconsistent with <i>Rowan</i> (on which the Court of Appeals relied), it would be significant that <i>Robinson</i> is the later case, but we read the two as compatible. In <i>Rowan,</i> the question was whether the value of meals and lodging given to employees by an employer for its own convenience should be counted in computing \"wages\" under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 <i>et seq.,</i> and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 <i>et seq.</i> Treasury Regulations made this value \"includable in `wages' as defined in FICA and FUTA, even though excludable from `wages' under the substantially identical\" statutory definition of \"wages\" for income-tax withholding purposes. 452 U.S., at 252, 101 S.Ct. 2288. Although we ultimately held that the income tax treatment was the proper one across the board, we did not see it this way simply because a \"substantially identical\" definition of \"wages\" appeared in each of the different statutory provisions. Instead, we relied on a manifest \"congressional concern for the interest of simplicity and ease of administration.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 255, 101 S.Ct. 2288 (internal quotation marks omitted). The FICA and FUTA regulations fell for failing to \"serve that interest,\" <i>id.,</i> at 257, 101 S.Ct. 2288, not for defying definitional identity.</p>\n<p>In fact, in a setting much like <i>Rowan,</i> we recently declined to require uniformity when resolving ambiguities in identical statutory terms. In <i>United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,</i> 532 U.S. 200, 121 S.Ct. 1433, 149 L.Ed.2d 401 (2001), we rejected the notion that using the phrase \"wages paid\" in both \"the discrete taxation and benefits eligibility contexts\" can, standing alone, \"compel symmetrical construction,\" <i>id.,</i> at 213, 121 S.Ct. 1433; we gave \"substantial judicial deference\" to the \"longstanding,\" \"reasonable,\" and differing interpretations adopted by the Internal Revenue Service in its regulations and Revenue Rulings. <i>Id.,</i> at 218-220, 121 S.Ct. 1433. There is, then, no \"effectively irrebuttable\" presumption that the same defined term in different provisions of the same statute must \"be interpreted identically.\" 411 F.3d, at 550. Context counts.</p>\n<p>It is true that the Clean Air Act did not merely repeat the term \"modification\" or the same definition of that word in its NSPS and PSD sections; the PSD language referred back to the section defining \"modification\" for NSPS purposes. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(2)(C). But that did not matter in <i>Robinson,</i> and we do not see the distinction as making any difference here. Nothing in the text or the legislative history of the technical amendments that added the cross-reference to NSPS suggests that Congress had details of regulatory implementation in mind when it imposed PSD requirements on modified sources; the cross-reference alone is certainly no unambiguous congressional code for eliminating the customary agency discretion to resolve questions about a statutory definition by looking to the surroundings of the defined term, where it occurs. See <i>New York,</i> 413 F.3d, at 19 (\"So far as appears, . . . [this] incorporatio[n] by reference [is] the equivalent of Congress's having simply repeated in the [PSD] context the definitional language used before in the NSPS context\"); compare 91 Stat. 745 (expressly incorporating in an unrelated provision of the 1977 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1434</span> amendments \"the interpretative regulation of the [EPA] Administrator . . . published in 41 Federal Register 55524-30\" with specified exceptions); <i>New York, supra,</i> at 19 (\"Congress's failure to use such an express incorporation of prior regulations for `modification' cuts against\" any suggestion that \"Congress intended to incorporate\" into the Act the \"preexisting regulatory definition\" of \"modification\"). Absent any iron rule to ignore the reasons for regulating PSD and NSPS \"modifications\" differently, EPA's construction need do no more than fall within the limits of what is reasonable, as set by the Act's common<sup>[6]</sup> definition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals's reasoning that the PSD regulations must conform to their NSPS counterparts led the court to read those PSD regulations in a way that seems to us too far a stretch for the language used. The 1980 PSD regulations on \"modification\" simply cannot be taken to track the agency's regulatory definition under the NSPS.</p>\n<p>True, the 1980 PSD regulations may be no seamless narrative, but they clearly do not define a \"major modification\" in terms of an increase in the \"hourly emissions rate.\" On its face, the definition in the PSD regulations specifies no rate at all, hourly or annual, merely requiring a physical or operational change \"that would result in a significant net emissions increase of any\" regulated pollutant. 40 CFR \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i). But even when a rate is mentioned, as in the regulatory definitions of the two terms, \"significant\" and \"net emissions increase,\" the rate is annual, not hourly. Each of the thresholds that quantify \"significant\" is described in \"tons per year,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(23)(i), and a \"net emissions increase\" is an \"increase in actual emissions\" measured against an \"average\" prior emissions rate of so many \"tons per year.\" \u00a7\u00a7 51.166(b)(3) and (21)(ii). And what is further at odds with the idea that hourly rate is relevant is the mandate that \"[a]ctual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(21)(ii), since \"actual emissions\" must be measured in a manner that looks to the number of hours the unit is or probably will be actually running. What these provisions are getting at is a measure of actual operations averaged over time, and the regulatory language simply cannot be squared with a regime under which \"hourly rate of emissions,\" 411 F.3d, at 550 (emphasis deleted), is dispositive.</p>\n<p>The reasons invoked by the Court of Appeals for its different view are no match for these textual differences. The appellate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1435</span> court cited two authorities ostensibly demonstrating that the 1980 PSD regulations \"can be interpreted consistently\" with the hourly emissions test, the first being the analysis of the District Court in this case. <i>Id.,</i> at 549, n. 7. The District Court thought that an increase in the hourly emissions rate was necessarily a prerequisite to a PSD \"major modification\" because a provision of the 1980 PSD regulations excluded an \"`increase in the hours of operation or in the production rate'\" from the scope of \"`[a] physical change or change in the method of operation.'\" 278 F.Supp.2d, at 640-641 (quoting 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(iii)(<i>f</i>) and (3)(i)(<i>a</i>) (1987)). The District Court read this exclusion to require, in effect, that a source's hours of operation \"be held constant\" when preproject emissions are being compared with postproject emissions for the purpose of calculating the \"net emissions increase.\" 278 F.Supp.2d, at 640.</p>\n<p>We think this understanding of the 1980 PSD regulations makes the mistake of overlooking the difference between the two separate components of the regulatory definition of \"major modification\": \"[1] any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that [2] would result in a significant net emissions increase of any pollutant subject to regulation under the Act.\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i); cf. <i>New York,</i> 413 F.3d, at 11 (\"[The statutory] definition requires <i>both</i> a change\u0097whether physical or operational\u0097<i>and</i> a resulting increase in emissions of a pollutant\" (emphasis in original)); <i>Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v. Reilly,</i> 893 F.2d 901, 907 (C.A.7 1990) (same). The exclusion of \"increase in . . . hours . . . or . . . production rate,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(iii)(<i>f</i>), speaks to the first of these components (\"physical change . . . or change in . . . method,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i)), but not to the second (\"significant net emissions increase,\" <i>ibid.</i>). As the preamble to the 1980 PSD regulations explains, forcing companies to obtain a PSD permit before they could simply adjust operating hours \"would severely and unduly hamper the ability of any company to take advantage of favorable market conditions.\" 45 Fed.Reg. 52704. In other words, a mere increase in the hours of operation, standing alone, is not a \"physical change or change in the method of operation.\" 40 CFR \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p>But the District Court took this language a step further. It assumed that increases in operating hours (resulting in emissions increases at the old rate per hour) must be ignored even if caused or enabled by an independent \"physical change . . . or change in the method of operation.\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i). That reading, however, turns an exception to the first component of the definition into a mandate to ignore the very facts that would count under the second, which defines \"net emissions increase\" in terms of \"actual emissions,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(3), during \"the unit's actual operating hours,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(21)(ii); see also 57 Fed.Reg. 32328 (1992) (\"[A]n increase in emissions attributable to an increase in hours of operation or production rate which is the result of a construction-related activity is not excluded from [PSD] review . . .\").<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1436</span> The Court of Appeals invoked one other source of support, the suggestion in the Reich opinions that a physical or operational change increasing a source's hours of operation, without an increase in the hourly emissions rate, cannot be a PSD \"major modification.\" Duke continues to rely on those opinions here, asserting that \"there are no contrary Agency pronouncements.\" Brief for Respondent Duke 28. The Reich letters are not, however, heavy ammunition. Their persuasiveness is elusive, neither of them containing more than one brief and conclusory statement supporting Duke's position. Nor, it seems, are they unembarrassed by any \"contrary Agency pronouncements.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. 258 (Memorandum of Don R. Clay, Acting Assistant EPA Administrator for Air and Radiation) (Sept. 9, 1988) (when \"plans to increase production rate or hours of operation are inextricably intertwined with the physical changes planned,\" they are \"precisely the type of change in hours or rate o[f] operation that would disturb a prior assessment of a source's environmental impact and should have to undergo PSD review scrutiny\" (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); see also 57 Fed. Reg. 32328. In any event, it answers the citation of the Reich letters to realize that an isolated opinion of an agency official does not authorize a court to read a regulation inconsistently with its language.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, the text of the 1980 PSD regulations on \"modification\" doomed the Court of Appeals's attempt to equate those regulations with their NSPS counterpart. As a consequence, we have to see the Court of Appeals's construction of the 1980 PSD regulations as an implicit invalidation of those regulations, a form of judicial review implicating the provisions of \u00a7 307(b) of the Act, which limit challenges to the validity of a regulation during enforcement proceedings when such review \"could have been obtained\" in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia within 60 days of EPA rulemaking. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b); see also <i>United States v. Cinergy Corp.,</i> 458 F.3d 705, 707-708 (C.A.7 2006); <i>Wisconsin Electric Power Co.,</i> 893 F.2d, at 914, n. 6. Because the Court of Appeals did not believe that its analysis reached validity, it did not consider the applicability or effect of that limitation here. We have no occasion at this point to consider the significance of \u00a7 307(b) ourselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Finally, Duke assumes for argument that the Act and the 1980 regulations may authorize EPA to construe a PSD \"modification\" as it has done, but it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1437</span> charges that the agency has taken inconsistent positions and is now \"retroactively targeting twenty years of accepted practice.\" Brief for Respondent Duke 37; see also Brief for State of Alabama et al. as <i>Amici Curiae.</i> This claim, too, has not been tackled by the District Court or the Court of Appeals; to the extent it is not procedurally foreclosed, Duke may press it on remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, concurring in part.</p>\n<p>I join all but Part III-A of the Court's opinion. I write separately to note my disagreement with the dicta in that portion of the opinion, which states that the statutory cross-reference does not mandate a singular regulatory construction.</p>\n<p>The Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) statute explicitly links the definition of the term \"modification\" to that term's definition in the New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) statute:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The term `construction' when used in connection with any source or facility, includes the modification (as defined in section 7411(a) of this title) of any source or facility.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(2)(C).</blockquote>\n<p>Section 7411(a) contains the NSPS definition of \"modification,\" which the parties agree is the relevant statutory definition of the term for both PSD and NSPS. Because of the cross-reference, the definitions of \"modification\" in PSD and NSPS are one and the same. The term \"modification\" therefore has the same meaning despite contextual variations in the two admittedly different statutory schemes. Congress' explicit linkage of PSD's definition of \"modification\" to NSPS' prevents the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from adopting differing regulatory definitions of \"modification\" for PSD and NSPS. Cf. <i>IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez,</i> 546 U.S. 21, 34, 126 S.Ct. 514, 163 L.Ed.2d 288 (2005) (concluding that an \"explicit reference\" to a previous statutory definition prohibits interpreting the same word differently).</p>\n<p>Section 7479(2)(C)'s cross-reference carries more meaning than the mere repetition of the same word in a different statutory context. When Congress repeats the same word in a different statutory context, it is possible that Congress might have intended the context to alter the meaning of the word. See <i>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc. v. United States,</i> 286 U.S. 427, 433, 52 S.Ct. 607, 76 L.Ed. 1204 (1932). No such possibility exists with \u00a7 7479(2)(C). By incorporating NSPS' definition of \"modification,\" Congress demonstrated that it did not intend for PSD's definition of \"modification\" to hinge on contextual factors unique to the PSD statutory scheme. Thus, <i>United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,</i> 532 U.S. 200, 121 S.Ct. 1433, 149 L.Ed.2d 401 (2001), which analyzes the mere repetition of the same word in a different statutory context, carries little weight in this situation.</p>\n<p>Likewise, this case differs from the circumstance we faced in <i>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> 519 U.S. 337, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997). In <i>Robinson,</i> we considered whether \"employee,\" as used in \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, included former employees. We determined that under the clear language of the statute, certain statutory provisions using the term \"employee\" made sense only with respect to former employees or current employees, but not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1438</span> both. <i>Id.,</i> at 342-343, 117 S.Ct. 843. Accordingly, upon analyzing the context of \u00a7 704(a), we were compelled to conclude that the term \"employee\" included former employees. This case does not present a similar situation. The statute here includes a statutory cross-reference, which conveys a clear congressional intent to provide a common definition for the term \"modification.\" And the contextual differences between PSD and NSPS do not compel different meanings for the term \"modification.\" <i>Robinson</i> is, therefore, inapplicable.</p>\n<p>Even if the cross-reference were merely the equivalent of repeating the words of the definition, we must still apply our usual presumption that the same words repeated in different parts of the same statute have the same meaning. See <i>Atlantic Cleaners, supra,</i> at 433, 52 S.Ct. 607; <i>ante,</i> at 1432. That presumption has not been overcome here. While the broadly stated regulatory goals of PSD and NSPS differ, these contextual differences do not compel different definitions of \"modification.\" That is, unlike in <i>Robinson,</i> reading the statutory definition in the separate contexts of PSD and NSPS does not require different interpretations of the term \"modification.\" EPA demonstrated as much when it recently proposed regulations that would unify the regulatory definitions of \"modification.\" See 70 Fed.Reg. 61083, n. 3 (2005) (terming the proposal \"an appropriate exercise of our discretion\" and stating that the unified definition better serves PSD's goals).</p>\n<p>The majority opinion does little to overcome the presumption that the same words, when repeated, carry the same meaning. Instead, it explains that this Court's cases do not compel identical language to be interpreted identically in all situations. Granting that point, the majority still has the burden of stating why our general presumption does not control the outcome here. It has not done so.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  EPA's 1975 NSPS regulations did not specify that the \"rate\" means the maximum rate possible for the technology, see 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 60.14(a)-(b) (1977), but the parties all read the regulations this way. See Brief for Petitioners 2; Brief for United States 7; Brief for Respondent Duke 32. At another point in the NSPS regulations, a different definition of \"modification\" appeared: \"`Modification' means any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, an existing facility which increases the amount of any air pollutant (to which a standard applies) emitted into the atmosphere by that facility,\" \u00a7 60.2(h); see also <i>New York v. EPA,</i> 413 F.3d 3, 11-12 (C.A.D.C.2005) <i>(per curiam)</i> (\"[N]either the 1975 regulation nor its preamble explained why EPA found it necessary to offer these two separate glosses on `modification'\").</p>\n<p>[2]  Statutory PSD superseded a regulatory PSD scheme established by EPA in 1974. See 39 Fed.Reg. 42510. Under the regulations, the term \"modification\" was defined as \"any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the emission rate of any pollutant for which a national standard has been promulgated.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 42514.</p>\n<p>[3]  Although EPA had promulgated an earlier set of PSD regulations in 1978, 43 Fed.Reg. 26380, none of the parties argues that they govern the conduct at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>[4]  The United States argues that some of Duke's projects were governed by EPA's PSD regulations promulgated in 1992 rather than the 1980 PSD regulations. Brief for United States 20, n. 4. Duke disputes this. Brief for Respondent Duke 14, n. 4. Because the United States acknowledges that the two sets of regulations \"did not materially differ with respect to the legal question at issue here,\" Brief for United States 20, n. 4, we will assume, as did the Court of Appeals and the District Court, that the 1980 PSD regulations control. 411 F.3d, at 543, n. 1; <i>United States v. Duke Energy Corp.,</i> 278 F.Supp.2d 619, 629 (M.D.N.C.2003).</p>\n<p>[5]  The Court of Appeals noted that EPA was free to abandon the requirement that a \"modification\" be accompanied by an increase in the hourly rate of emissions, provided it did so for both the NSPS and PSD programs. 411 F.3d, at 550-551. In other words, the Court of Appeals raised no question about the reasonableness of the definition of \"modification\" in the 1980 PSD regulations, apart from its deviation from the definition contained in NSPS regulations.</p>\n<p>[6]  Duke argues that the 1977 amendments intended to incorporate EPA's definition of \"modification\" under the 1974 regulatory PSD program. Brief for Respondent Duke 44; see also n. 2, <i>supra.</i> We find no support for this argument in the statutory text, which refers to the statutory NSPS definition rather than the regulatory PSD definition. Although Duke correctly points out that \"Congress instructed that the bulk of the pre-existing rules `shall remain in effect,'\" Brief for Respondent Duke 44 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7478(a)), this instruction was a temporary measure \"[u]ntil such time as an applicable implementation plan is in effect,\" \u00a7 7478(a). We therefore do not read this language as a restriction on EPA's authority to interpret the statutory PSD provisions reasonably in a manner that departs from the 1974 regulations. Duke also invokes <i>Bragdon v. Abbott,</i> 524 U.S. 624, 631, 118 S.Ct. 2196, 141 L.Ed.2d 540 (1998), for the proposition that \"use of the pre-existing term `modification' `carries the implication that Congress intended the term to be construed in accordance with pre-existing regulatory interpretations.'\" Brief for Respondent Duke 44. But this reasoning is unavailing here, given the existence of at least three distinct regulatory definitions of \"modification\" at the time of the 1977 amendments. See <i>supra,</i> at ___-___ 2-3, and nn. 1, 2.</p>\n<p>[7]  Two Courts of Appeals agree. See <i>United States v. Cinergy Corp.,</i> 458 F.3d 705, 708 (C.A.7 2006) (\"[M]erely running the plant closer to its maximum capacity is not a major modification because it does not involve either a physical change or a change in the <i>method</i> of operation. If, however, a physical change enables the plant to increase its output, then, according to the EPA's interpretation, the exclusion for merely operating the plant for longer hours is inapplicable\" (emphasis in original)); <i>Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v. Reilly,</i> 893 F.2d 901, 916, n. 11 (C.A.7 1990) (the regulatory exclusion for increases in the hours of operation \"was provided to allow facilities to take advantage of fluctuating market conditions, not construction or modification activity\"); <i>Puerto Rican Cement Co. v. EPA,</i> 889 F.2d 292, 298 (C.A.1 1989) (\"[T]here is no logical contradiction in rules that, on the one hand, permit firms using <i>existing</i> capacity simply to increase their output and, on the other, use the potential output of <i>new</i> capacity as a basis for calculating an increase in emissions levels\" (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p>[8]  Duke now offers an alternative argument for applying the hourly emissions test for the PSD program: before a project can become a \"major modification\" under the PSD regulations, 40 CFR \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i) (1987), it must meet the definition of \"modification\" under the NSPS regulations, \u00a7 60.14(a). That sounds right, but the language of the regulations does not support it. For example, it would be superfluous for PSD regulations to require a \"major modification\" to be \"a physical change in or change in the method of operation,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i), if they presupposed that the NSPS definition of \"modification,\" which contains the same prerequisite, \u00a7 60.14(a), had already been satisfied. The NSPS and PSD regulations are complementary and not related as set to subset.</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued November 1, 2006\u2014Decided April 2, 2007\nIn the 1970s, Congress added two air pollution control schemes to the\n  Clean Air Act (Act): New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and\n  Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD), each of which covers\n  modified, as well as new, stationary sources of air pollution. The\n  NSPS provisions define \u201cmodification\u201d of such a source as a physical\n  change to it, or a change in the method of its operation, that in\n  creases the amount of a pollutant discharged or emits a new one. 42\n  U. S. C. \u00a77411(a)(4). The PSD provisions require a permit before a\n  \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d can be \u201cconstructed,\u201d \u00a77475(a), and define\n  such \u201cconstruction\u201d to include a \u201cmodification (as defined in [NSPS]),\u201d\n  \u00a77479(2)(C). Despite this definitional identity, the Environmental\n  Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) regulations interpret \u201cmodification\u201d one\n  way for NSPS but differently for PSD. The NSPS regulations require\n  a source to use the best available pollution-limiting technology, see\n  Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467\n  U. S. 837, 846, when a modification would increase the discharge of\n  pollutants measured in kilograms per hour, 40 CFR \u00a760.14(a), but\n  the 1980 PSD regulations require a permit for a modification only\n  when it is a \u201cmajor\u201d one, \u00a751.166(b)(2)(i), and only when it would in\n  crease the actual annual emission of a pollutant above the actual av\n  erage for the two prior years, \u00a751.166(b)(21)(ii).\n    After respondent Duke Energy Corporation replaced or redesigned\n  the workings of some of its coal-fired electric generating units, the\n  United States filed this enforcement action, claiming, among other\n  things, that Duke violated the PSD provisions by doing the work\n  without permits. Petitioner environmental groups intervened as\n  plaintiffs and filed a complaint charging similar violations. Duke\n2       ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE v. DUKE ENERGY CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    moved for summary judgment, asserting, inter alia, that none of its\n    projects was a \u201cmajor modification\u201d requiring a PSD permit because\n    none increased hourly emissions rates. Agreeing, the District Court\n    entered summary judgment for Duke on all PSD claims. The Fourth\n    Circuit affirmed, reasoning that Congress\u2019s decision to create identi\n    cal statutory definitions of \u201cmodification\u201d in the Act\u2019s NSPS and PSD\n    provisions affirmatively mandated that this term be interpreted iden\n    tically in the regulations promulgated under those provisions. When\n    the court sua sponte requested supplemental briefing on the rele\n    vance of this Court\u2019s decision in Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452\n    U. S. 247, 250, that the Government could not adopt different inter\n    pretations of the word \u201cwages\u201d in different statutory provisions,\n    plaintiffs injected a new issue into the case, arguing that a claim that\n    the 1980 PSD regulation exceeded statutory authority would be an\n    attack on the regulation\u2019s validity that could not be raised in an en\n    forcement proceeding, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a77607(b)(2), since judicial review\n    for validity can be obtained only by a petition to the District of Colum\n    bia Circuit, generally within 60 days of EPA\u2019s rulemaking, \u00a77607(b)(1).\n    The Fourth Circuit rejected this argument, ruling that its interpretation\n    did not invalidate the PSD regulations because they can be interpreted\n    to require an increase in the hourly emissions rate as an element of a\n    major \u201cmodification.\u201d\nHeld: The Fourth Circuit\u2019s reading of the PSD regulations in an effort\n to conform them with their NSPS counterparts on \u201cmodification\u201d\n amounted to the invalidation of the PSD regulations, which must\n comport with the Clean Air Act\u2019s limits on judicial review of EPA\n regulations for validity. Pp. 8\u201317.\n     (a) Principles of statutory interpretation do not rigidly mandate\n identical regulation here. Because \u201c[m]ost words have different\n shades of meaning and consequently may be variously construed,\n [even] when [they are] used more than once in the same statute or\n . . . section,\u201d the \u201cnatural presumption that identical words used in\n different parts of the same act are intended to have the same mean\n ing . . . is not rigid and readily yields whenever there is such varia\n tion in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to\n warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of\n the act with different intent.\u201d Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v.\n United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433. A given term in the same statute\n may take on distinct characters from association with distinct statu\n tory objects calling for different ways of implementation. The point is\n the same even when the terms share a common statutory definition,\n if it is general enough. See Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337,\n 343\u2013344. Robinson is not inconsistent with Rowan, where the\n Court\u2019s invalidation of the differing interpretations of \u201cwages,\u201d 452\n                   Cite as: 549 U.

S., at 252, turned not on the fact that a \u201csubstantially identical\u201d\ndefinition of that word appeared in each of the statutory provisions at\nissue, but on the failure of the regulations in question to serve Con\ngress\u2019s manifest \u201cconcern for the interest of simplicity and ease of\nadministration,\u201d id., at 255. In fact, in a case close to Rowan\u2019s facts,\nthe Court recently declined to follow a categorical rule of resolving\nambiguities in identical statutory terms identically regardless of\ntheir surroundings, United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,\n532 U. S. 200, 213, but instead accorded \u201csubstantial judicial defer\nence\u201d to an agency\u2019s \u201clongstanding,\u201d \u201creasonable,\u201d and differing inter\npretations of the statutory term at issue, id., at 218\u2013220. It makes\nno difference here that the Clean Air Act does not merely repeat the\nsame definition in its NSPS and PSD provisions, but that the PSD\nprovisions refer back to the section defining \u201cmodification\u201d for NSPS\npurposes. Nothing in the text or legislative history of the statutory\namendment that added the NSPS cross-reference suggests that Con\ngress meant to eliminate customary agency discretion to resolve\nquestions about a statutory definition by looking to the surroundings\nin which the defined term appears. EPA\u2019s construction need do no\nmore than fall within the outer limits of what is reasonable, as set by\nthe Act\u2019s common definition. Pp. 9\u201312.\n   (b) The Fourth Circuit\u2019s construction of the 1980 PSD regulations\nto conform them to their NSPS counterparts was not a permissible\nreading of their terms. The PSD regulations clearly do not define a\n\u201cmajor modification\u201d in terms of an increase in the \u201chourly emissions\nrate.\u201d On its face, the definitional section specifies no rate at all,\nhourly or annual, merely requiring a \u201cphysical change in or change in\nthe method of operation of a major stationary source that would re\nsult in a significant net emissions increase of any\u201d regulated pollut\nant. 40 CFR \u00a751.166(b)(2)(i). But even when the regulations men\ntion a rate, it is annual, not hourly. See, e.g., \u00a751.166(b)(23)(i).\nFurther at odds with the idea that hourly rate is relevant is the man\ndate that \u201c[a]ctual emissions shall be calculated using the unit\u2019s ac\ntual operating hours,\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(21)(ii), since \u201cactual emissions\u201d\nmust be measured in a manner looking to the number of hours the\nunit is or probably will be actually running. The Court of Appeals\u2019s\nreasons for its different view are no match for these textual differ\nences. Consequently, the Court of Appeals\u2019s construction of the 1980\nPSD regulations must be seen as an implicit invalidation of those\nregulations, a form of judicial review implicating the provisions of\n\u00a77607(b), which limit challenges to the validity of a regulation during\nenforcement proceedings when such review \u201ccould have been ob\ntained\u201d in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia within 60\ndays of EPA rulemaking. Because the Court of Appeals did not be\n4       ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE v.

The NSPS provi\nsions define the term \u201cmodification,\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a77411(a)(4), while the PSD provisions use that word \u201cas\ndefined in\u201d NSPS, \u00a77479(2)(C). The Court of Appeals\nconcluded that the statute requires the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) to conform its PSD regulations\non \u201cmodification\u201d to their NSPS counterparts, and that\nEPA\u2019s 1980 PSD regulations can be given this conforming\nconstruction. We hold that the Court of Appeals\u2019s reading\nof the 1980 PSD regulations, intended to align them with\nNSPS, was inconsistent with their terms and effectively\ninvalidated them; any such result must be shown to com\nport with the Act\u2019s restrictions on judicial review of EPA\nregulations for validity.\n                       I\n  The Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1676,\n2     ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE v. DUKE ENERGY CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbroadened federal authority to combat air pollution, see\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\ncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 845\u2013846 (1984), and directed EPA\nto devise National Ambient Air Quality Standards\n(NAAQS) limiting various pollutants, which the States\nwere obliged to implement and enforce, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77409,\n7410. The amendments dealing with NSPS authorized\nEPA to require operators of stationary sources of air pol\nlutants to use the best technology for limiting pollution,\nChevron, supra, at 846; see also 1 F. Grad, Environmental\nLaw \u00a72.03, p. 2\u2013356 (2006), both in newly constructed\nsources and those undergoing \u201cmodification,\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a77411(a)(2). Section 111(a) of the 1970 amendments de\nfined this term within the NSPS scheme as \u201cany physical\nchange in, or change in the method of operation of, a sta\ntionary source which increases the amount of any air\npollutant emitted by such source or which results in the\nemission of any air pollutant not previously emitted,\u201d 42\nU. S. C. \u00a77411(a)(4).\n   EPA\u2019s 1975 regulations implementing NSPS provided\ngenerally that \u201cany physical or operational change to an\nexisting facility which results in an increase in the emis\nsion rate to the atmosphere of any pollutant to which a\nstandard applies shall be considered a modification within\nthe meaning of [S]ection 111.\u201d 40 CFR \u00a760.14(a) (1976).\nEspecially significant here is the identification of an NSPS\n\u201cmodification\u201d as a change that \u201cincrease[s] . . . the emis\nsion rate,\u201d which \u201cshall be expressed as kg/hr of any pol\nlutant discharged into the atmosphere.\u201d \u00a760.14(b).1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 EPA\u2019s 1975 NSPS regulations did not specify that the \u201crate\u201d means the\n\nmaximum rate possible for the technology, see 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a760.14(a)\u2013(b)\n(1977), but the parties all read the regulations this way. See Brief for\nPetitioners 2; Brief for United States 7; Brief for Respondent Duke 32.\nAt another point in the NSPS regulations, a different definition of \u201cmodifi\ncation\u201d appeared: \u201c \u2018Modification\u2019 means any physical change in, or change\nin the method of operation of, an existing facility which increases the\n                      Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  NSPS, however, did too little to \u201cachiev[e] the ambitious\ngoals of the 1970 Amendments,\u201d R. Belden, Clean Air Act 7\n(2001) (hereinafter Belden), and the Clean Air Act Amend\nments of 1977, 91 Stat. 685, included the PSD provisions,\nwhich aimed at giving added protection to air quality in\ncertain parts of the country \u201cnotwithstanding attainment\nand maintenance of\u201d the NAAQS. 42 U. S. C. \u00a77470(1).2\nThe 1977 amendments required a PSD permit before a\n\u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d could be \u201cconstructed\u201d in an area\ncovered by the scheme. \u00a77475(a). As originally enacted,\nPSD applied only to newly constructed sources, but soon a\ntechnical amendment added the following subparagraph:\n\u201cThe term \u2018construction\u2019 when used in connection with any\nsource or facility, includes the modification (as defined in\n[S]ection 111(a)) of any source or facility.\u201d \u00a714(a)(54), 91\nStat. 1402, 42 U. S. C. \u00a77479(2)(C); see also New York v.\nEPA, 413 F. 3d 3, 13 (CADC 2005). In other words, the\n\u201cconstruction\u201d requiring a PSD permit under the statute\nwas made to include (though it was not limited to)\na \u201cmodification\u201d as defined in the statutory NSPS\nprovisions.\n  In 1980, EPA issued PSD regulations,3 which \u201climited\nthe application of [PSD] review\u201d of modified sources to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\namount of any air pollutant (to which a standard applies) emitted into the\natmosphere by that facility,\u201d \u00a760.2(h); see also New York v. EPA, 413 F. 3d\n3, 11\u201312 (CADC 2005) (per curiam) (\u201c[N]either the 1975 regulation nor its\npreamble explained why EPA found it necessary to offer these two sepa\nrate glosses on \u2018modification\u2019 \u201d).\n   2 Statutory PSD superseded a regulatory PSD scheme established by\n\nEPA in 1974. See 39 Fed. Reg. 42510. Under the regulations, the term\n\u201cmodification\u201d was defined as \u201cany physical change in, or change in the\nmethod of operation of, a stationary source which increases the emis\nsion rate of any pollutant for which a national standard has been\npromulgated.\u201d Id., at 42514.\n   3 Although EPA had promulgated an earlier set of PSD regulations in\n\n1978, 43 Fed. Reg. 26380, none of the parties argues that they govern\nthe conduct at issue in this case.\n4    ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE v. DUKE ENERGY CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninstances of \u201c \u2018major\u2019 modificatio[n],\u201d Belden 46, defined as\n\u201cany physical change in or change in the method of opera\ntion of a major stationary source that would result in a\nsignificant net emissions increase of any pollutant subject\nto regulation under the Act.\u201d 40 CFR \u00a751.166(b)(2)(i)\n(1987). Further regulations in turn addressed various\nelements of this definition, three of which are to the point\nhere. First, the regulations specified that an operational\nchange consisting merely of \u201c[a]n increase in the hours of\noperation or in the production rate\u201d would not generally\nconstitute a \u201cphysical change or change in the method of\noperation.\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(2)(iii)(f ). For purposes of a PSD\npermit, that is, such an operational change would not\namount to a \u201cmodification\u201d as the Act defines it. Second,\nthe PSD regulations defined a \u201cnet emissions increase\u201d as\n\u201c[a]ny increase in actual emissions from a particular\nphysical change or change in the method of operation,\u201d net\nof other contemporaneous \u201cincreases and decreases in\nactual emissions at the source.\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(3). \u201cActual\nemissions\u201d were defined to \u201cequal the average rate, in tons\nper year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant\nduring a two-year period which precedes the particular\ndate and which is representative of normal source opera\ntion.\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(21)(ii). \u201c[A]ctual emissions\u201d were to be\n\u201ccalculated using the unit\u2019s actual operating hours [and]\nproduction rates.\u201d Ibid. Third, the term \u201csignificant\u201d was\ndefined as \u201ca rate of emissions that would equal or exceed\u201d\none or another enumerated threshold, each expressed in\n\u201ctons per year.\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(23)(i).\n   It would be bold to try to synthesize these statutory and\nregulatory provisions in a concise paragraph, but three\npoints are relatively clear about the regime that covers\nthis case:\n    (a) The Act defines modification of a stationary\n    source of a pollutant as a physical change to it, or a\n    change in the method of its operation, that increases\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    the amount of a pollutant discharged or emits a new\n    one.\n    (b) EPA\u2019s NSPS regulations require a source to use\n    the best available pollution-limiting technology only\n    when a modification would increase the rate of dis\n    charge of pollutants measured in kilograms per hour.\n    (c) EPA\u2019s 1980 PSD regulations require a permit for\n    a modification (with the same statutory definition)\n    only when it is a major one and only when it would in\n    crease the actual annual emission of a pollutant above\n    the actual average for the two prior years.\n   The Court of Appeals held that Congress\u2019s provision\ndefining a PSD modification by reference to an NSPS\nmodification caught not only the statutory NSPS defini\ntion, but also whatever regulatory gloss EPA puts on that\ndefinition at any given time (for the purposes of the best\ntechnology requirement). When, therefore, EPA\u2019s PSD\nregulations specify the \u201cchange\u201d that amounts to a \u201cmajor\nmodification\u201d requiring a PSD permit, they must measure\nan increase in \u201cthe amount of any air pollutant emitted,\u201d\n42 U. S. C. \u00a77411(a)(4), in terms of the hourly rate of\ndischarge, just the way NSPS regulations do. Petitioners\nand the United States say, on the contrary, that when\nEPA addresses the object of the PSD scheme it is free to\nput a different regulatory interpretation on the common\nstatutory core of \u201cmodification,\u201d by measuring increased\nemission not in terms of hourly rate but by the actual,\nannual discharge of a pollutant that will follow the modifi\ncation, regardless of rate per hour. This disagreement is\nthe nub of the case.\n                           II\n  Respondent Duke Energy Corporation runs 30 coal-fired\nelectric generating units at eight plants in North and\nSouth Carolina. United States v. Duke Energy Corp., 411\nF. 3d 539, 544 (CA4 2005). The units were placed in ser\n6     ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE v. DUKE ENERGY CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nvice between 1940 and 1975, and each includes a boiler\ncontaining thousands of steel tubes arranged in sets. Ibid.\nBetween 1988 and 2000,4 Duke replaced or redesigned 29\ntube assemblies in order to extend the life of the units and\nallow them to run longer each day. Ibid.\n  The United States filed this action in 2000, claiming,\namong other things, that Duke violated the PSD provi\nsions by doing this work without permits. Environmental\nDefense, North Carolina Sierra Club, and North Carolina\nPublic Interest Research Group Citizen Lobby/Education\nFund intervened as plaintiffs and filed a complaint charg\ning similar violations.\n  Duke moved for summary judgment, one of its positions\nbeing that none of the projects was a \u201cmajor modification\u201d\nrequiring a PSD permit because none increased hourly\nrates of emissions. The District Court agreed with Duke\u2019s\nreading of the 1980 PSD regulations. It reasoned that\ntheir express exclusion of \u201c[a]n increase in the hours of\noperation\u201d from the definition of a \u201cphysical change or\nchange in the method of operation\u201d implied that \u201cpost\nproject emissions levels must be calculated assuming\u201d pre-\nproject hours of operation. 278 F. Supp. 2d 619, 640\u2013641\n(MDNC 2003). Consequently, the District Court said, a\nPSD \u201cmajor modification\u201d can occur \u201conly if the project\nincreases the hourly rate of emissions.\u201d Id., at 641. The\nDistrict Court found further support for its construction of\nthe 1980 PSD regulations in one letter and one memoran\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The United States argues that some of Duke\u2019s projects were gov\n\nerned by EPA\u2019s PSD regulations promulgated in 1992 rather than the\n1980 PSD regulations. Brief for United States 20, n. 4. Duke disputes\nthis. Brief for Respondent Duke 14, n. 4. Because the United States\nacknowledges that the two sets of regulations \u201cdid not materially differ\nwith respect to the legal question at issue here,\u201d Brief for United States\n20, n. 4, we will assume, as did the Court of Appeals and the District\nCourt, that the 1980 PSD regulations control. 411 F. 3d, at 543, n. 1;\nUnited States v. Duke Energy Corp., 278 F. Supp. 2d 619, 629 (MDNC\n2003).\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndum written in 1981 by EPA\u2019s Director of the Division of\nStationary Source Enforcement, Edward E. Reich. Id., at\n641\u2013642.\n   The United States and intervenor-plaintiffs (collectively,\nplaintiffs) subsequently stipulated \u201cthat they do not con\ntend that the projects at issue in this case caused an in\ncrease in the maximum hourly rate of emissions at any of\nDuke Energy\u2019s units.\u201d App. 504. Rather, their claim \u201cis\nbased solely on their contention that the projects would\nhave been projected to result in an increased utilization of\nthe units at issue.\u201d Ibid. Duke, for its part, stipulated to\nplaintiffs\u2019 right to appeal the District Court\u2019s determina\ntion that projects resulting in greater operating hours are\nnot \u201cmajor modifications\u201d triggering the PSD permit re\nquirement, absent an increase in the hourly rate of emis\nsions. The District Court then entered summary judg\nment for Duke on all PSD claims.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed,\n\u201calbeit for somewhat different reasons.\u201d 411 F. 3d, at 542.\n\u201c[T]he language and various interpretations of the PSD\nregulations . . . are largely irrelevant to the proper analy\nsis of this case,\u201d reasoned the Court of Appeals, \u201cbecause\nCongress\u2019 decision to create identical statutory definitions\nof the term \u2018modification\u2019 \u201d in the NSPS and PSD provi\nsions of the Clean Air Act \u201chas affirmatively mandated\nthat this term be interpreted identically\u201d in the regula\ntions promulgated under those provisions. Id., at 547,\nn. 3, 550. The Court of Appeals relied principally on the\nauthority of Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452 U. S. 247,\n250 (1981), where we held against the Government\u2019s differ\ning interpretations of the word \u201cwages\u201d in different tax\nprovisions. 411 F. 3d, at 550. As the Court of Appeals saw\nit, Rowan establishes an \u201ceffectively irrebuttable\u201d pre\nsumption that PSD regulations must contain the same\nconditions for a \u201cmodification\u201d as the NSPS regulations,\n8     ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE v. DUKE ENERGY CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nincluding an increase in the hourly rate of emissions.5 411\nF. 3d, at 550.\n   As the Court of Appeals said, Duke had not initially\nrelied on Rowan, see 411 F. 3d, at 547, n. 4, and when the\nCourt sua sponte requested supplemental briefing on\nRowan\u2019s relevance, plaintiffs injected a new issue into the\ncase. They argued that a claim that the 1980 PSD regula\ntion exceeded statutory authority would be an attack on\nthe validity of the regulation that could not be raised in an\nenforcement proceeding. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a77607(b)(2). Un\nder \u00a7307(b) of the Act, they said, judicial review for validity\ncan be obtained only by a petition to the Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit, generally within 60\ndays of EPA\u2019s rulemaking. 42 U. S. C. \u00a77607(b).\n   The Court of Appeals rejected this argument. \u201cOur choice\nof this interpretation of the PSD regulations . . . is not an\ninvalidation of those regulations,\u201d it said, because \u201cthe\nPSD regulations can be interpreted\u201d to require an increase\nin the hourly emissions rate as an element of a major\n\u201cmodification\u201d triggering the permit requirement. 411 F. 3d,\nat 549, n. 7. To show that the 1980 PSD regulations are\nopen to this construction, the Court of Appeals cited the\nconclusions of the District Court and the Reich opinions.\n   We granted the petition for certiorari brought by inter\nvenor-plaintiffs, 547 U. S. __ (2006), and now vacate.\n                         III\n  The Court of Appeals understood that it was simply\nconstruing EPA\u2019s 1980 PSD regulations in a permissible\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The Court of Appeals noted that EPA was free to abandon the re\n\nquirement that a \u201cmodification\u201d be accompanied by an increase in the\nhourly rate of emissions, provided it did so for both the NSPS and PSD\nprograms. 411 F. 3d, at 550\u2013551. In other words, the Court of Appeals\nraised no question about the reasonableness of the definition of \u201cmodifi\ncation\u201d in the 1980 PSD regulations, apart from its deviation from the\ndefinition contained in NSPS regulations.\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nway that left them in harmony with their NSPS counter\npart and, hence, the Act\u2019s single definition of \u201cmodifica\ntion.\u201d The plaintiffs say that the Court of Appeals was\nrewriting the PSD regulations in a way neither required\nby the Act nor consistent with their own text.\n   It is true that no precise line runs between a purposeful\nbut permissible reading of the regulation adopted to bring\nit into harmony with the Court of Appeals\u2019s view of the\nstatute, and a determination that the regulation as writ\nten is invalid. But the latter occurred here, for the Court\nof Appeals\u2019s efforts to trim the PSD regulations to match\ntheir different NSPS counterparts can only be seen as an\nimplicit declaration that the PSD regulations were invalid\nas written.\n                              A\n  In applying the 1980 PSD regulations to Duke\u2019s conduct,\nthe Court of Appeals thought that, by defining the term\n\u201cmodification\u201d identically in its NSPS and PSD provisions,\nthe Act required EPA to conform its PSD interpretation of\nthat definition to any such interpretation it reasonably\nadhered to under NSPS. But principles of statutory con\nstruction are not so rigid. Although we presume that the\nsame term has the same meaning when it occurs here and\nthere in a single statute, the Court of Appeals mischarac\nterized that presumption as \u201ceffectively irrebuttable.\u201d 411\nF. 3d, at 550. We also understand that \u201c[m]ost words have\ndifferent shades of meaning and consequently may be\nvariously construed, not only when they occur in different\nstatutes, but when used more than once in the same stat\nute or even in the same section.\u201d Atlantic Cleaners &\nDyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932).\nThus, the \u201cnatural presumption that identical words used\nin different parts of the same act are intended to have the\nsame meaning . . . is not rigid and readily yields whenever\nthere is such variation in the connection in which the\n10   ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE v. DUKE ENERGY CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwords are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion\nthat they were employed in different parts of the act with\ndifferent intent.\u201d Ibid. A given term in the same statute\nmay take on distinct characters from association with\ndistinct statutory objects calling for different implementa\ntion strategies.\n   The point is the same even when the terms share a\ncommon statutory definition, if it is general enough, as we\nrecognized in Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337\n(1997). There the question was whether the term \u201cem\nployees\u201d in \u00a7704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 covered former employees. Title VII expressly de\nfined the term \u201cemployee,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e(f), but the\ndefinition was \u201cconsistent with either current or past\nemployment,\u201d 519 U. S., at 342, and we held that \u201ceach\nsection\u201d of Title VII \u201cmust be analyzed to determine\nwhether the context gives the term a further meaning that\nwould resolve the issue in dispute,\u201d id., at 343\u2013344.\n   If Robinson were inconsistent with Rowan (on which the\nCourt of Appeals relied), it would be significant that Rob\ninson is the later case, but we read the two as compatible.\nIn Rowan, the question was whether the value of meals\nand lodging given to employees by an employer for its own\nconvenience should be counted in computing \u201cwages\u201d\nunder the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), 26\nU. S. C. \u00a73101 et seq., and the Federal Unemployment Tax\nAct (FUTA), 26 U. S. C. \u00a73301 et seq. Treasury Regula\ntions made this value \u201cincludable in \u2018wages\u2019 as defined in\nFICA and FUTA, even though excludable from \u2018wages\u2019\nunder the substantially identical\u201d statutory definition of\n\u201cwages\u201d for income-tax withholding purposes. 452 U. S.,\nat 252. Although we ultimately held that the income tax\ntreatment was the proper one across the board, we did not\nsee it this way simply because a \u201csubstantially identical\u201d\ndefinition of \u201cwages\u201d appeared in each of the different\nstatutory provisions. Instead, we relied on a manifest\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201ccongressional concern for the interest of simplicity and\nease of administration.\u201d Id., at 255 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The FICA and FUTA regulations fell for\nfailing to \u201cserve that interest,\u201d id., at 257, not for defying\ndefinitional identity.\n   In fact, in a setting much like Rowan, we recently de\nclined to require uniformity when resolving ambiguities in\nidentical statutory terms. In United States v. Cleveland\nIndians Baseball Co., 532 U. S. 200 (2001), we rejected the\nnotion that using the phrase \u201cwages paid\u201d in both \u201cthe\ndiscrete taxation and benefits eligibility contexts\u201d can,\nstanding alone, \u201ccompel symmetrical construction,\u201d id., at\n213; we gave \u201csubstantial judicial deference\u201d to the \u201clong-\nstanding,\u201d \u201creasonable,\u201d and differing interpretations\nadopted by the Internal Revenue Service in its regulations\nand Revenue Rulings. Id., at 218\u2013220. There is, then, no\n\u201ceffectively irrebuttable\u201d presumption that the same de\nfined term in different provisions of the same statute must\n\u201cbe interpreted identically.\u201d 411 F. 3d, at 550. Context\ncounts.\n   It is true that the Clean Air Act did not merely repeat\nthe term \u201cmodification\u201d or the same definition of that word\nin its NSPS and PSD sections; the PSD language referred\nback to the section defining \u201cmodification\u201d for NSPS pur\nposes. 42 U. S. C. \u00a77479(2)(C). But that did not matter in\nRobinson, and we do not see the distinction as making any\ndifference here. Nothing in the text or the legislative\nhistory of the technical amendments that added the cross-\nreference to NSPS suggests that Congress had details of\nregulatory implementation in mind when it imposed PSD\nrequirements on modified sources; the cross-reference\nalone is certainly no unambiguous congressional code for\neliminating the customary agency discretion to resolve\nquestions about a statutory definition by looking to the\nsurroundings of the defined term, where it occurs. See\nNew York, 413 F. 3d, at 19 (\u201cSo far as appears, . . . [this]\n12    ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE v.

Absent any iron\nrule to ignore the reasons for regulating PSD and NSPS\n\u201cmodifications\u201d differently, EPA\u2019s construction need do no\nmore than fall within the limits of what is reasonable, as\nset by the Act\u2019s common6 definition.\n                            B\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019s reasoning that the PSD regula\ntions must conform to their NSPS counterparts led the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Duke argues that the 1977 amendments intended to incorporate\n\nEPA\u2019s definition of \u201cmodification\u201d under the 1974 regulatory PSD\nprogram. Brief for Respondent Duke 44; see also n. 2, supra. We find\nno support for this argument in the statutory text, which refers to the\nstatutory NSPS definition rather than the regulatory PSD definition.\nAlthough Duke correctly points out that \u201cCongress instructed that the\nbulk of the pre-existing rules \u2018shall remain in effect,\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respon\ndent Duke 44 (quoting 42 U. S. C. \u00a77478(a)), this instruction was a\ntemporary measure \u201c[u]ntil such time as an applicable implementation\nplan is in effect,\u201d \u00a77478(a). We therefore do not read this language as a\nrestriction on EPA\u2019s authority to interpret the statutory PSD provisions\nreasonably in a manner that departs from the 1974 regulations. Duke\nalso invokes Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S. 624, 631 (1998), for the\nproposition that \u201cuse of the pre-existing term \u2018modification\u2019 \u2018carries the\nimplication that Congress intended the term to be construed in accor\ndance with pre-existing regulatory interpretations.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respon\ndent Duke 44. But this reasoning is unavailing here, given the exis\ntence of at least three distinct regulatory definitions of \u201cmodification\u201d at\nthe time of the 1977 amendments.

S. ____ (2007)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt to read those PSD regulations in a way that seems to\nus too far a stretch for the language used. The 1980 PSD\nregulations on \u201cmodification\u201d simply cannot be taken to\ntrack the agency\u2019s regulatory definition under the NSPS.\n   True, the 1980 PSD regulations may be no seamless\nnarrative, but they clearly do not define a \u201cmajor modifica\ntion\u201d in terms of an increase in the \u201chourly emissions\nrate.\u201d On its face, the definition in the PSD regulations\nspecifies no rate at all, hourly or annual, merely requiring\na physical or operational change \u201cthat would result in a\nsignificant net emissions increase of any\u201d regulated pol\nlutant. 40 CFR \u00a751.166(b)(2)(i). But even when a rate is\nmentioned, as in the regulatory definitions of the two\nterms, \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cnet emissions increase,\u201d the rate\nis annual, not hourly. Each of the thresholds that quan\ntify \u201csignificant\u201d is described in \u201ctons per year,\u201d\n\u00a751.166(b)(23)(i), and a \u201cnet emissions increase\u201d is an\n\u201cincrease in actual emissions\u201d measured against an \u201caver\nage\u201d prior emissions rate of so many \u201ctons per year.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a751.166(b)(3) and (21)(ii). And what is further at odds\nwith the idea that hourly rate is relevant is the mandate\nthat \u201c[a]ctual emissions shall be calculated using the\nunit\u2019s actual operating hours,\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(21)(ii), since\n\u201cactual emissions\u201d must be measured in a manner that\nlooks to the number of hours the unit is or probably will be\nactually running. What these provisions are getting at is\na measure of actual operations averaged over time, and\nthe regulatory language simply cannot be squared with a\nregime under which \u201chourly rate of emissions,\u201d 411 F. 3d,\nat 550 (emphasis deleted), is dispositive.\n   The reasons invoked by the Court of Appeals for its\ndifferent view are no match for these textual differences.\nThe appellate court cited two authorities ostensibly dem\nonstrating that the 1980 PSD regulations \u201ccan be inter\npreted consistently\u201d with the hourly emissions test, the\nfirst being the analysis of the District Court in this case.\n14   ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE v. DUKE ENERGY CORP.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 549, n. 7. The District Court thought that an in\ncrease in the hourly emissions rate was necessarily a\nprerequisite to a PSD \u201cmajor modification\u201d because a\nprovision of the 1980 PSD regulations excluded an \u201c \u2018in\ncrease in the hours of operation or in the production rate\u2019 \u201d\nfrom the scope of \u201c \u2018[a] physical change or change in the\nmethod of operation.\u2019 \u201d 278 F. Supp. 2d, at 640\u2013641 (quot\ning 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a751.166(b)(2)(iii)(f) and (3)(i)(a) (1987)). The\nDistrict Court read this exclusion to require, in effect, that\na source\u2019s hours of operation \u201cbe held constant\u201d when pre-\nproject emissions are being compared with postproject\nemissions for the purpose of calculating the \u201cnet emissions\nincrease.\u201d 278 F. Supp. 2d, at 640.\n    We think this understanding of the 1980 PSD regula\ntions makes the mistake of overlooking the difference\nbetween the two separate components of the regulatory\ndefinition of \u201cmajor modification\u201d: \u201c[1] any physical change\nin or change in the method of operation of a major station\nary source that [2] would result in a significant net emis\nsions increase of any pollutant subject to regulation under\nthe Act.\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(2)(i); cf. New York, 413 F. 3d, at 11\n(\u201c[The statutory] definition requires both a change\u2014\nwhether physical or operational\u2014and a resulting increase\nin emissions of a pollutant\u201d (emphasis in original)); Wis\nconsin Electric Power Co. v. Reilly, 893 F. 2d 901, 907\n(CA7 1990) (same). The exclusion of \u201cincrease in . . . hours\n. . . or . . . production rate,\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(2)(iii)(f), speaks to\nthe first of these components (\u201cphysical change . . . or\nchange in . . . method,\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(2)(i)), but not to the\nsecond (\u201csignificant net emissions increase,\u201d ibid.). As the\npreamble to the 1980 PSD regulations explains, forcing\ncompanies to obtain a PSD permit before they could sim\nply adjust operating hours \u201cwould severely and unduly\nhamper the ability of any company to take advantage of\nfavorable market conditions.\u201d 45 Fed. Reg. 52704. In other\nwords, a mere increase in the hours of operation, standing\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nalone, is not a \u201cphysical change or change in the method of\noperation.\u201d 40 CFR \u00a751.166(b)(2)(iii).\n   But the District Court took this language a step further.\nIt assumed that increases in operating hours (resulting in\nemissions increases at the old rate per hour) must be\nignored even if caused or enabled by an independent\n\u201cphysical change . . . or change in the method of opera\ntion.\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(2)(i). That reading, however, turns an\nexception to the first component of the definition into a\nmandate to ignore the very facts that would count under\nthe second, which defines \u201cnet emissions increase\u201d in\nterms of \u201cactual emissions,\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(3), during \u201cthe\nunit\u2019s actual operating hours,\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(21)(ii); see also\n57 Fed.

DUKE ENERGY CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrely on those opinions here, asserting that \u201cthere are no\ncontrary Agency pronouncements.\u201d Brief for Respondent\nDuke 28. The Reich letters are not, however, heavy am\nmunition. Their persuasiveness is elusive, neither of them\ncontaining more than one brief and conclusory statement\nsupporting Duke\u2019s position. Nor, it seems, are they unem\nbarrassed by any \u201ccontrary Agency pronouncements.\u201d See,\ne.g., App. 258 (Memorandum of Don R. Clay, Acting Assis\ntant EPA Administrator for Air and Radiation (Sept. 9,\n1988) (when \u201cplans to increase production rate or hours of\noperation are inextricably intertwined with the physical\nchanges planned,\u201d they are \u201cprecisely the type of change in\nhours or rate o[f] operation that would disturb a prior\nassessment of a source\u2019s environmental impact and should\nhave to undergo PSD review scrutiny\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks and alterations omitted)); see also 57 Fed. Reg.\n32328. In any event, it answers the citation of the Reich\nletters to realize that an isolated opinion of an agency\nofficial does not authorize a court to read a regulation\ninconsistently with its language.8\n   In sum, the text of the 1980 PSD regulations on \u201cmodifi\ncation\u201d doomed the Court of Appeals\u2019s attempt to equate\nthose regulations with their NSPS counterpart. As a\nconsequence, we have to see the Court of Appeals\u2019s con\nstruction of the 1980 PSD regulations as an implicit in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 Duke now offers an alternative argument for applying the hourly\n\nemissions test for the PSD program: before a project can become a \u201cmajor\nmodification\u201d under the PSD regulations, 40 CFR \u00a751.166(b)(2)(i) (1987),\nit must meet the definition of \u201cmodification\u201d under the NSPS regula\ntions, \u00a760.14(a). That sounds right, but the language of the regulations\ndoes not support it. For example, it would be superfluous for PSD\nregulations to require a \u201cmajor modification\u201d to be \u201ca physical change in\nor change in the method of operation,\u201d \u00a751.166(b)(2)(i), if they presup\nposed that the NSPS definition of \u201cmodification,\u201d which contains the\nsame prerequisite, \u00a760.14(a), had already been satisfied. The NSPS\nand PSD regulations are complementary and not related as set to\nsubset.\n                  Cite as: 549 U.

Because the Court of\nAppeals did not believe that its analysis reached validity,\nit did not consider the applicability or effect of that limita\ntion here. We have no occasion at this point to consider\nthe significance of \u00a7307(b) ourselves.\n                             IV\n  Finally, Duke assumes for argument that the Act and\nthe 1980 regulations may authorize EPA to construe a\nPSD \u201cmodification\u201d as it has done, but it charges that the\nagency has taken inconsistent positions and is now \u201cretro\nactively targeting twenty years of accepted practice.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent Duke 37; see also Brief for State of\nAlabama et al. as Amici Curiae.

I write\nseparately to note my disagreement with the dicta in that\nportion of the opinion, which states that the statutory\ncross-reference does not mandate a singular regulatory\nconstruction.\n   The Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) stat\nute explicitly links the definition of the term \u201cmodifica\ntion\u201d to that term\u2019s definition in the New Source Perform\nance Standard (NSPS) statute:\n    \u201cThe term \u2018construction\u2019 when used in connection with\n    any source or facility, includes the modification (as de\n    fined in section 7411(a) of this title) of any source or\n    facility.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a77479(2)(C).\nSection 7411(a) contains the NSPS definition of \u201cmodifica\ntion,\u201d which the parties agree is the relevant statutory\ndefinition of the term for both PSD and NSPS. Because of\nthe cross-reference, the definitions of \u201cmodification\u201d in\nPSD and NSPS are one and the same. The term \u201cmodifi\ncation\u201d therefore has the same meaning despite contextual\nvariations in the two admittedly different statutory\nschemes. Congress\u2019 explicit linkage of PSD\u2019s definition of\n\u201cmodification\u201d to NSPS\u2019 prevents the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) from adopting differing regula\n2    ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE v. DUKE ENERGY CORP.\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in part\n\ntory definitions of \u201cmodification\u201d for PSD and NSPS. Cf.\nIBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34 (2005) (concluding\nthat an \u201cexplicit reference\u201d to a previous statutory defini\ntion prohibits interpreting the same word differently).\n   Section 7479(2)(C)\u2019s cross-reference carries more mean\ning than the mere repetition of the same word in a differ\nent statutory context. When Congress repeats the same\nword in a different statutory context, it is possible that\nCongress might have intended the context to alter the\nmeaning of the word. See Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc.\nv. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932). No such possi\nbility exists with \u00a77479(2)(C). By incorporating NSPS\u2019\ndefinition of \u201cmodification,\u201d Congress demonstrated that it\ndid not intend for PSD\u2019s definition of \u201cmodification\u201d to\nhinge on contextual factors unique to the PSD statutory\nscheme. Thus, United States v. Cleveland Indians Base\nball Co., 532 U. S. 200 (2001), which analyzes the mere\nrepetition of the same word in a different statutory con\ntext, carries little weight in this situation.\n   Likewise, this case differs from the circumstance we\nfaced in Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337 (1997). In\nRobinson, we considered whether \u201cemployee,\u201d as used in\n\u00a7704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in\ncluded former employees. We determined that under the\nclear language of the statute, certain statutory provisions\nusing the term \u201cemployee\u201d made sense only with respect to\nformer employees or current employees, but not both. Id.,\nat 342\u2013343. Accordingly, upon analyzing the context of\n\u00a7704(a), we were compelled to conclude that the term\n\u201cemployee\u201d included former employees. This case does not\npresent a similar situation. The statute here includes a\nstatutory cross-reference, which conveys a clear congres\nsional intent to provide a common definition for the term\n\u201cmodification.\u201d And the contextual differences between\nPSD and NSPS do not compel different meanings for the\nterm \u201cmodification.\u201d Robinson is, therefore, inapplicable.\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           3\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in part\n\n   Even if the cross-reference were merely the equivalent\nof repeating the words of the definition, we must still\napply our usual presumption that the same words re\npeated in different parts of the same statute have the\nsame meaning. See Atlantic Cleaners, supra, at 433; ante,\nat 9. That presumption has not been overcome here.\nWhile the broadly stated regulatory goals of PSD and\nNSPS differ, these contextual differences do not compel\ndifferent definitions of \u201cmodification.\u201d That is, unlike in\nRobinson, reading the statutory definition in the separate\ncontexts of PSD and NSPS does not require different\ninterpretations of the term \u201cmodification.\u201d EPA demon\nstrated as much when it recently proposed regulations\nthat would unify the regulatory definitions of \u201cmodifica\ntion.\u201d See 70 Fed. Reg. 61083, n. 3 (2005) (terming the\nproposal \u201can appropriate exercise of our discretion\u201d and\nstating that the unified definition better serves PSD\u2019s\ngoals).\n   The majority opinion does little to overcome the pre\nsumption that the same words, when repeated, carry the\nsame meaning. Instead, it explains that this Court\u2019s cases\ndo not compel identical language to be interpreted identi\ncally in all situations. Granting that point, the majority\nstill has the burden of stating why our general presump\ntion does not control the outcome here. It has not done so.\n",

The NSPS provisions define the term \"modification,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(a)(4), while the PSD provisions use that word \"as defined in\" NSPS, \u00a7 7479(2)(C). The Court of Appeals concluded that the statute requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conform its PSD regulations on \"modification\" to their NSPS counterparts, and that EPA's 1980 PSD regulations can be given this conforming construction. We hold that the Court of Appeals's reading of the 1980 PSD regulations, intended to align them with NSPS, was inconsistent with their terms and effectively invalidated them; any such result must be shown to comport with the Act's restrictions on judicial review of EPA regulations for validity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1676, broadened federal authority to combat air pollution, see <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 845-846, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), and directed EPA to devise National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) limiting various pollutants, which the States were obliged to implement and enforce, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7409, 7410. The amendments dealing with NSPS authorized EPA to require operators of stationary sources of air pollutants to use the best technology for limiting pollution, <i>Chevron, supra,</i> at 846, 104 S.Ct. 2778; see also 1 F. Grad, Environmental Law \u00a7 2.03, p. 2-356 (2006), both in newly constructed sources and those undergoing \"modification,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(a)(2). Section 111(a) of the 1970 amendments defined this term within the NSPS scheme as \"any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(a)(4).</p>\n<p>EPA's 1975 regulations implementing NSPS provided generally that \"any physical or operational change to an existing facility which results in an increase in the emission rate to the atmosphere of any pollutant to which a standard applies shall be considered a modification within the meaning of [S]ection 111.\" 40 CFR \u00a7 60.14(a) (1976). Especially significant here is the identification of an NSPS \"modification\" as a change that \"increase[s]. . . the emission rate,\" which \"shall be expressed as kg/hr of any pollutant discharged into the atmosphere.\" \u00a7 60.14(b).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1429</span> NSPS, however, did too little to \"achiev[e] the ambitious goals of the 1970 Amendments,\" R. Belden, Clean Air Act 7 (2001) (hereinafter Belden), and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, 91 Stat. 685, included the PSD provisions, which aimed at giving added protection to air quality in certain parts of the country \"notwithstanding attainment and maintenance of\" the NAAQS. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7470(1).<sup>[2]</sup> The 1977 amendments required a PSD permit before a \"major emitting facility\" could be \"constructed\" in an area covered by the scheme. \u00a7 7475(a). As originally enacted, PSD applied only to newly constructed sources, but soon a technical amendment added the following subparagraph: \"The term `construction' when used in connection with any source or facility, includes the modification (as defined in [S]ection 111(a)) of any source or facility.\" \u00a7 14(a)(54), 91 Stat. 1402, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(2)(C); see also <i>New York v. EPA,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></span>, 13 (C.A.D.C.2005). In other words, the \"construction\" requiring a PSD permit under the statute was made to include (though it was not limited to) a \"modification\" as defined in the statutory NSPS provisions.</p>\n<p>In 1980, EPA issued PSD regulations,<sup>[3]</sup> which \"limited the application of [PSD] review\" of modified sources to instances of \"`major' modificatio[n],\" Belden 46, defined as \"any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that would result in a significant net emissions increase of any pollutant subject to regulation under the Act.\" 40 CFR \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i) (1987). Further regulations in turn addressed various elements of this definition, three of which are to the point here. First, the regulations specified that an operational change consisting merely of \"[a]n increase in the hours of operation or in the production rate\" would not generally constitute a \"physical change or change in the method of operation.\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(iii)(<i>f</i>). For purposes of a PSD permit, that is, such an operational change would not amount to a \"modification\" as the Act defines it. Second, the PSD regulations defined a \"net emissions increase\" as \"[a]ny increase in actual emissions from a particular physical change or change in the method of operation,\" net of other contemporaneous \"increases and decreases in actual emissions at the source.\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(3). \"Actual emissions\" were defined to \"equal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a two-year period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation.\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(21)(ii). \"[A]ctual emissions\" were to be \"calculated using the unit's actual operating hours [and] production rates.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Third, the term \"significant\" was defined as \"a rate of emissions that would equal or exceed\" one or another enumerated threshold, each expressed in \"tons per year.\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(23)(i).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1430</span> It would be bold to try to synthesize these statutory and regulatory provisions in a concise paragraph, but three points are relatively clear about the regime that covers this case:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) The Act defines modification of a stationary source of a pollutant as a physical change to it, or a change in the method of its operation, that increases the amount of a pollutant discharged or emits a new one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) EPA's NSPS regulations require a source to use the best available pollution-limiting technology only when a modification would increase the rate of discharge of pollutants measured in kilograms per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(c) EPA's 1980 PSD regulations require a permit for a modification (with the same statutory definition) only when it is a major one and only when it would increase the actual annual emission of a pollutant above the actual average for the two prior years.</blockquote>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held that Congress's provision defining a PSD modification by reference to an NSPS modification caught not only the statutory NSPS definition, but also whatever regulatory gloss EPA puts on that definition at any given time (for the purposes of the best technology requirement). When, therefore, EPA's PSD regulations specify the \"change\" that amounts to a \"major modification\" requiring a PSD permit, they must measure an increase in \"the amount of any air pollutant emitted,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(a)(4), in terms of the hourly rate of discharge, just the way NSPS regulations do. Petitioners and the United States say, on the contrary, that when EPA addresses the object of the PSD scheme it is free to put a different regulatory interpretation on the common statutory core of \"modification,\" by measuring increased emission not in terms of hourly rate but by the actual, annual discharge of a pollutant that will follow the modification, regardless of rate per hour. This disagreement is the nub of the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Respondent Duke Energy Corporation runs 30 coal-fired electric generating units at eight plants in North and South Carolina. <i>United States v. Duke Energy Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></span>, 544 (C.A.4 2005). The units were placed in service between 1940 and 1975, and each includes a boiler containing thousands of steel tubes arranged in sets. <i>Ibid.</i> Between 1988 and 2000,<sup>[4]</sup> Duke replaced or redesigned 29 tube assemblies in order to extend the life of the units and allow them to run longer each day. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The United States filed this action in 2000, claiming, among other things, that Duke violated the PSD provisions by doing this work without permits. Environmental Defense, North Carolina Sierra Club, and North Carolina Public Interest Research Group Citizen Lobby/Education Fund intervened as plaintiffs and filed a complaint charging similar violations.</p>\n<p>Duke moved for summary judgment, one of its positions being that none of the projects was a \"major modification\" requiring <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1431</span> a PSD permit because none increased hourly rates of emissions. The District Court agreed with Duke's reading of the 1980 PSD regulations. It reasoned that their express exclusion of \"[a]n increase in the hours of operation\" from the definition of a \"physical change or change in the method of operation\" implied that \"post-project emissions levels must be calculated assuming\" preproject hours of operation. 278 F.Supp.2d 619, 640-641 (M.D.N.C.2003). Consequently, the District Court said, a PSD \"major modification\" can occur \"only if the project increases the hourly rate of emissions.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 641. The District Court found further support for its construction of the 1980 PSD regulations in one letter and one memorandum written in 1981 by EPA's Director of the Division of Stationary Source Enforcement, Edward E. Reich. <i>Id.,</i> at 641-642.</p>\n<p>The United States and intervenor-plaintiffs (collectively, plaintiffs) subsequently stipulated \"that they do not contend that the projects at issue in this case caused an increase in the maximum hourly rate of emissions at any of Duke Energy's units.\" App. 504. Rather, their claim \"is based solely on their contention that the projects would have been projected to result in an increased utilization of the units at issue.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Duke, for its part, stipulated to plaintiffs' right to appeal the District Court's determination that projects resulting in greater operating hours are not \"major modifications\" triggering the PSD permit requirement, absent an increase in the hourly rate of emissions. The District Court then entered summary judgment for Duke on all PSD claims.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, \"albeit for somewhat different reasons.\" 411 F.3d, at 542. \"[T]he language and various interpretations of the PSD regulations . . . are largely irrelevant to the proper analysis of this case,\" reasoned the Court of Appeals, \"because Congress' decision to create identical statutory definitions of the term `modification'\" in the NSPS and PSD provisions of the Clean Air Act \"has affirmatively mandated that this term be interpreted identically\" in the regulations promulgated under those provisions. <i>Id.,</i> at 547, n. 3, 550. The Court of Appeals relied principally on the authority of <i>Rowan Cos. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110515\"><a href=\"/opinion/110515/rowan-cos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>, 250, 101 S.Ct. 2288, 68 L.Ed.2d 814 (1981), where we held against the Government's differing interpretations of the word \"wages\" in different tax provisions. 411 F.3d, at 550. As the Court of Appeals saw it, <i>Rowan</i> establishes an \"effectively irrebuttable\" presumption that PSD regulations must contain the same conditions for a \"modification\" as the NSPS regulations, including an increase in the hourly rate of emissions.<sup>[5]</sup> 411 F.3d, at 550.</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals said, Duke had not initially relied on <i>Rowan,</i> see 411 F.3d, at 547, n. 4, and when the Court <i>sua sponte</i> requested supplemental briefing on <i>Rowan's</i> relevance, plaintiffs injected a new issue into the case. They argued that a claim that the 1980 PSD regulation exceeded statutory authority would be an attack on the validity of the regulation that could not be raised in an enforcement proceeding. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(2). Under \u00a7 307(b) of the Act, they said, judicial review for validity can be obtained only by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1432</span> a petition to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, generally within 60 days of EPA's rulemaking. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals rejected this argument. \"Our choice of this interpretation of the PSD regulations . . . is not an invalidation of those regulations,\" it said, because \"the PSD regulations can be interpreted\" to require an increase in the hourly emissions rate as an element of a major \"modification\" triggering the permit requirement. 411 F.3d, at 549, n. 7. To show that the 1980 PSD regulations are open to this construction, the Court of Appeals cited the conclusions of the District Court and the Reich opinions.</p>\n<p>We granted the petition for certiorari brought by intervenor-plaintiffs, 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2019, 164 L.Ed.2d 778 (2006), and now vacate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals understood that it was simply construing EPA's 1980 PSD regulations in a permissible way that left them in harmony with their NSPS counterpart and, hence, the Act's single definition of \"modification.\" The plaintiffs say that the Court of Appeals was rewriting the PSD regulations in a way neither required by the Act nor consistent with their own text.</p>\n<p>It is true that no precise line runs between a purposeful but permissible reading of the regulation adopted to bring it into harmony with the Court of Appeals's view of the statute, and a determination that the regulation as written is invalid. But the latter occurred here, for the Court of Appeals's efforts to trim the PSD regulations to match their different NSPS counterparts can only be seen as an implicit declaration that the PSD regulations were invalid as written.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In applying the 1980 PSD regulations to Duke's conduct, the Court of Appeals thought that, by defining the term \"modification\" identically in its NSPS and PSD provisions, the Act required EPA to conform its PSD interpretation of that definition to any such interpretation it reasonably adhered to under NSPS. But principles of statutory construction are not so rigid. Although we presume that the same term has the same meaning when it occurs here and there in a single statute, the Court of Appeals mischaracterized that presumption as \"effectively irrebuttable.\" 411 F.3d, at 550. We also understand that \"[m]ost words have different shades of meaning and consequently may be variously construed, not only when they occur in different statutes, but when used more than once in the same statute or even in the same section.\" <i>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101939\"><a href=\"/opinion/101939/atlantic-cleaners-dyers-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span>, 433, 52 S.Ct. 607, 76 L.Ed. 1204 (1932). Thus, the \"natural presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning . . . is not rigid and readily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent.\" <i>Ibid.</i> A given term in the same statute may take on distinct characters from association with distinct statutory objects calling for different implementation strategies.</p>\n<p>The point is the same even when the terms share a common statutory definition, if it is general enough, as we recognized in <i>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118082\"><a href=\"/opinion/118082/robinson-v-shell-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span>, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997). There the question was whether the term \"employees\" in \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 covered former employees. Title VII expressly defined <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1433</span> the term \"employee,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(f), but the definition was \"consistent with either current or past employment,\" 519 U.S., at 342, 117 S.Ct. 843, and we held that \"each section\" of Title VII \"must be analyzed to determine whether the context gives the term a further meaning that would resolve the issue in dispute,\" <i>id.,</i> at 343-344, 117 S.Ct. 843.</p>\n<p>If <i>Robinson</i> were inconsistent with <i>Rowan</i> (on which the Court of Appeals relied), it would be significant that <i>Robinson</i> is the later case, but we read the two as compatible. In <i>Rowan,</i> the question was whether the value of meals and lodging given to employees by an employer for its own convenience should be counted in computing \"wages\" under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 <i>et seq.,</i> and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 <i>et seq.</i> Treasury Regulations made this value \"includable in `wages' as defined in FICA and FUTA, even though excludable from `wages' under the substantially identical\" statutory definition of \"wages\" for income-tax withholding purposes. 452 U.S., at 252, 101 S.Ct. 2288. Although we ultimately held that the income tax treatment was the proper one across the board, we did not see it this way simply because a \"substantially identical\" definition of \"wages\" appeared in each of the different statutory provisions. Instead, we relied on a manifest \"congressional concern for the interest of simplicity and ease of administration.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 255, 101 S.Ct. 2288 (internal quotation marks omitted). The FICA and FUTA regulations fell for failing to \"serve that interest,\" <i>id.,</i> at 257, 101 S.Ct. 2288, not for defying definitional identity.</p>\n<p>In fact, in a setting much like <i>Rowan,</i> we recently declined to require uniformity when resolving ambiguities in identical statutory terms. In <i>United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118419\"><a href=\"/opinion/118419/united-states-v-cleveland-indians-baseball-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 121 S.Ct. 1433, 149 L.Ed.2d 401 (2001), we rejected the notion that using the phrase \"wages paid\" in both \"the discrete taxation and benefits eligibility contexts\" can, standing alone, \"compel symmetrical construction,\" <i>id.,</i> at 213, 121 S.Ct. 1433; we gave \"substantial judicial deference\" to the \"longstanding,\" \"reasonable,\" and differing interpretations adopted by the Internal Revenue Service in its regulations and Revenue Rulings. <i>Id.,</i> at 218-220, 121 S.Ct. 1433. There is, then, no \"effectively irrebuttable\" presumption that the same defined term in different provisions of the same statute must \"be interpreted identically.\" 411 F.3d, at 550. Context counts.</p>\n<p>It is true that the Clean Air Act did not merely repeat the term \"modification\" or the same definition of that word in its NSPS and PSD sections; the PSD language referred back to the section defining \"modification\" for NSPS purposes. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(2)(C). But that did not matter in <i>Robinson,</i> and we do not see the distinction as making any difference here. Nothing in the text or the legislative history of the technical amendments that added the cross-reference to NSPS suggests that Congress had details of regulatory implementation in mind when it imposed PSD requirements on modified sources; the cross-reference alone is certainly no unambiguous congressional code for eliminating the customary agency discretion to resolve questions about a statutory definition by looking to the surroundings of the defined term, where it occurs. See <i>New York,</i> 413 F.3d, at 19 (\"So far as appears, . . . [this] incorporatio[n] by reference [is] the equivalent of Congress's having simply repeated in the [PSD] context the definitional language used before in the NSPS context\"); compare 91 Stat. 745 (expressly incorporating in an unrelated provision of the 1977 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1434</span> amendments \"the interpretative regulation of the [EPA] Administrator . . . published in 41 Federal Register 55524-30\" with specified exceptions); <i>New York, supra,</i> at 19 (\"Congress's failure to use such an express incorporation of prior regulations for `modification' cuts against\" any suggestion that \"Congress intended to incorporate\" into the Act the \"preexisting regulatory definition\" of \"modification\"). Absent any iron rule to ignore the reasons for regulating PSD and NSPS \"modifications\" differently, EPA's construction need do no more than fall within the limits of what is reasonable, as set by the Act's common<sup>[6]</sup> definition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals's reasoning that the PSD regulations must conform to their NSPS counterparts led the court to read those PSD regulations in a way that seems to us too far a stretch for the language used. The 1980 PSD regulations on \"modification\" simply cannot be taken to track the agency's regulatory definition under the NSPS.</p>\n<p>True, the 1980 PSD regulations may be no seamless narrative, but they clearly do not define a \"major modification\" in terms of an increase in the \"hourly emissions rate.\" On its face, the definition in the PSD regulations specifies no rate at all, hourly or annual, merely requiring a physical or operational change \"that would result in a significant net emissions increase of any\" regulated pollutant. 40 CFR \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i). But even when a rate is mentioned, as in the regulatory definitions of the two terms, \"significant\" and \"net emissions increase,\" the rate is annual, not hourly. Each of the thresholds that quantify \"significant\" is described in \"tons per year,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(23)(i), and a \"net emissions increase\" is an \"increase in actual emissions\" measured against an \"average\" prior emissions rate of so many \"tons per year.\" \u00a7\u00a7 51.166(b)(3) and (21)(ii). And what is further at odds with the idea that hourly rate is relevant is the mandate that \"[a]ctual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(21)(ii), since \"actual emissions\" must be measured in a manner that looks to the number of hours the unit is or probably will be actually running. What these provisions are getting at is a measure of actual operations averaged over time, and the regulatory language simply cannot be squared with a regime under which \"hourly rate of emissions,\" 411 F.3d, at 550 (emphasis deleted), is dispositive.</p>\n<p>The reasons invoked by the Court of Appeals for its different view are no match for these textual differences. The appellate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1435</span> court cited two authorities ostensibly demonstrating that the 1980 PSD regulations \"can be interpreted consistently\" with the hourly emissions test, the first being the analysis of the District Court in this case. <i>Id.,</i> at 549, n. 7. The District Court thought that an increase in the hourly emissions rate was necessarily a prerequisite to a PSD \"major modification\" because a provision of the 1980 PSD regulations excluded an \"`increase in the hours of operation or in the production rate'\" from the scope of \"`[a] physical change or change in the method of operation.'\" 278 F.Supp.2d, at 640-641 (quoting 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(iii)(<i>f</i>) and (3)(i)(<i>a</i>) (1987)). The District Court read this exclusion to require, in effect, that a source's hours of operation \"be held constant\" when preproject emissions are being compared with postproject emissions for the purpose of calculating the \"net emissions increase.\" 278 F.Supp.2d, at 640.</p>\n<p>We think this understanding of the 1980 PSD regulations makes the mistake of overlooking the difference between the two separate components of the regulatory definition of \"major modification\": \"[1] any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that [2] would result in a significant net emissions increase of any pollutant subject to regulation under the Act.\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i); cf. <i>New York,</i> 413 F.3d, at 11 (\"[The statutory] definition requires <i>both</i> a change\u0097whether physical or operational\u0097<i>and</i> a resulting increase in emissions of a pollutant\" (emphasis in original)); <i>Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v. Reilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534850\"><a href=\"/opinion/534850/wisconsin-electric-power-company-v-william-k-reill/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></a></span>, 907 (C.A.7 1990) (same). The exclusion of \"increase in . . . hours . . . or . . . production rate,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(iii)(<i>f</i>), speaks to the first of these components (\"physical change . . . or change in . . . method,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i)), but not to the second (\"significant net emissions increase,\" <i>ibid.</i>). As the preamble to the 1980 PSD regulations explains, forcing companies to obtain a PSD permit before they could simply adjust operating hours \"would severely and unduly hamper the ability of any company to take advantage of favorable market conditions.\" 45 Fed.Reg. 52704. In other words, a mere increase in the hours of operation, standing alone, is not a \"physical change or change in the method of operation.\" 40 CFR \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p>But the District Court took this language a step further. It assumed that increases in operating hours (resulting in emissions increases at the old rate per hour) must be ignored even if caused or enabled by an independent \"physical change . . . or change in the method of operation.\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i). That reading, however, turns an exception to the first component of the definition into a mandate to ignore the very facts that would count under the second, which defines \"net emissions increase\" in terms of \"actual emissions,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(3), during \"the unit's actual operating hours,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(21)(ii); see also 57 Fed.Reg. 32328 (1992) (\"[A]n increase in emissions attributable to an increase in hours of operation or production rate which is the result of a construction-related activity is not excluded from [PSD] review . . .\").<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1436</span> The Court of Appeals invoked one other source of support, the suggestion in the Reich opinions that a physical or operational change increasing a source's hours of operation, without an increase in the hourly emissions rate, cannot be a PSD \"major modification.\" Duke continues to rely on those opinions here, asserting that \"there are no contrary Agency pronouncements.\" Brief for Respondent Duke 28. The Reich letters are not, however, heavy ammunition. Their persuasiveness is elusive, neither of them containing more than one brief and conclusory statement supporting Duke's position. Nor, it seems, are they unembarrassed by any \"contrary Agency pronouncements.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. 258 (Memorandum of Don R. Clay, Acting Assistant EPA Administrator for Air and Radiation) (Sept. 9, 1988) (when \"plans to increase production rate or hours of operation are inextricably intertwined with the physical changes planned,\" they are \"precisely the type of change in hours or rate o[f] operation that would disturb a prior assessment of a source's environmental impact and should have to undergo PSD review scrutiny\" (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); see also 57 Fed. Reg. 32328. In any event, it answers the citation of the Reich letters to realize that an isolated opinion of an agency official does not authorize a court to read a regulation inconsistently with its language.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, the text of the 1980 PSD regulations on \"modification\" doomed the Court of Appeals's attempt to equate those regulations with their NSPS counterpart. As a consequence, we have to see the Court of Appeals's construction of the 1980 PSD regulations as an implicit invalidation of those regulations, a form of judicial review implicating the provisions of \u00a7 307(b) of the Act, which limit challenges to the validity of a regulation during enforcement proceedings when such review \"could have been obtained\" in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia within 60 days of EPA rulemaking. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b); see also <i>United States v. Cinergy Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795303\"><a href=\"/opinion/795303/united-states-of-america-and-state-of-new-york-pla/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span>, 707-708 (C.A.7 2006); <i>Wisconsin Electric Power Co.,</i> 893 F.2d, at 914, n. 6. Because the Court of Appeals did not believe that its analysis reached validity, it did not consider the applicability or effect of that limitation here. We have no occasion at this point to consider the significance of \u00a7 307(b) ourselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Finally, Duke assumes for argument that the Act and the 1980 regulations may authorize EPA to construe a PSD \"modification\" as it has done, but it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1437</span> charges that the agency has taken inconsistent positions and is now \"retroactively targeting twenty years of accepted practice.\" Brief for Respondent Duke 37; see also Brief for State of Alabama et al. as <i>Amici Curiae.</i> This claim, too, has not been tackled by the District Court or the Court of Appeals; to the extent it is not procedurally foreclosed, Duke may press it on remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, concurring in part.</p>\n<p>I join all but Part III-A of the Court's opinion. I write separately to note my disagreement with the dicta in that portion of the opinion, which states that the statutory cross-reference does not mandate a singular regulatory construction.</p>\n<p>The Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) statute explicitly links the definition of the term \"modification\" to that term's definition in the New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) statute:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The term `construction' when used in connection with any source or facility, includes the modification (as defined in section 7411(a) of this title) of any source or facility.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(2)(C).</blockquote>\n<p>Section 7411(a) contains the NSPS definition of \"modification,\" which the parties agree is the relevant statutory definition of the term for both PSD and NSPS. Because of the cross-reference, the definitions of \"modification\" in PSD and NSPS are one and the same. The term \"modification\" therefore has the same meaning despite contextual variations in the two admittedly different statutory schemes. Congress' explicit linkage of PSD's definition of \"modification\" to NSPS' prevents the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from adopting differing regulatory definitions of \"modification\" for PSD and NSPS. Cf. <i>IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1991818\"><a href=\"/opinion/1991818/ibp-inc-v-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 34, 126 S.Ct. 514, 163 L.Ed.2d 288 (2005) (concluding that an \"explicit reference\" to a previous statutory definition prohibits interpreting the same word differently).</p>\n<p>Section 7479(2)(C)'s cross-reference carries more meaning than the mere repetition of the same word in a different statutory context. When Congress repeats the same word in a different statutory context, it is possible that Congress might have intended the context to alter the meaning of the word. See <i>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101939\"><a href=\"/opinion/101939/atlantic-cleaners-dyers-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span>, 433, 52 S.Ct. 607, 76 L.Ed. 1204 (1932). No such possibility exists with \u00a7 7479(2)(C). By incorporating NSPS' definition of \"modification,\" Congress demonstrated that it did not intend for PSD's definition of \"modification\" to hinge on contextual factors unique to the PSD statutory scheme. Thus, <i>United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118419\"><a href=\"/opinion/118419/united-states-v-cleveland-indians-baseball-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 121 S.Ct. 1433, 149 L.Ed.2d 401 (2001), which analyzes the mere repetition of the same word in a different statutory context, carries little weight in this situation.</p>\n<p>Likewise, this case differs from the circumstance we faced in <i>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118082\"><a href=\"/opinion/118082/robinson-v-shell-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span>, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997). In <i>Robinson,</i> we considered whether \"employee,\" as used in \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, included former employees. We determined that under the clear language of the statute, certain statutory provisions using the term \"employee\" made sense only with respect to former employees or current employees, but not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1438</span> both. <i>Id.,</i> at 342-343, 117 S.Ct. 843. Accordingly, upon analyzing the context of \u00a7 704(a), we were compelled to conclude that the term \"employee\" included former employees. This case does not present a similar situation. The statute here includes a statutory cross-reference, which conveys a clear congressional intent to provide a common definition for the term \"modification.\" And the contextual differences between PSD and NSPS do not compel different meanings for the term \"modification.\" <i>Robinson</i> is, therefore, inapplicable.</p>\n<p>Even if the cross-reference were merely the equivalent of repeating the words of the definition, we must still apply our usual presumption that the same words repeated in different parts of the same statute have the same meaning. See <i>Atlantic Cleaners, supra,</i> at 433, 52 S.Ct. 607; <i>ante,</i> at 1432. That presumption has not been overcome here. While the broadly stated regulatory goals of PSD and NSPS differ, these contextual differences do not compel different definitions of \"modification.\" That is, unlike in <i>Robinson,</i> reading the statutory definition in the separate contexts of PSD and NSPS does not require different interpretations of the term \"modification.\" EPA demonstrated as much when it recently proposed regulations that would unify the regulatory definitions of \"modification.\" See 70 Fed.Reg. 61083, n. 3 (2005) (terming the proposal \"an appropriate exercise of our discretion\" and stating that the unified definition better serves PSD's goals).</p>\n<p>The majority opinion does little to overcome the presumption that the same words, when repeated, carry the same meaning. Instead, it explains that this Court's cases do not compel identical language to be interpreted identically in all situations. Granting that point, the majority still has the burden of stating why our general presumption does not control the outcome here. It has not done so.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  EPA's 1975 NSPS regulations did not specify that the \"rate\" means the maximum rate possible for the technology, see 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 60.14(a)-(b) (1977), but the parties all read the regulations this way. See Brief for Petitioners 2; Brief for United States 7; Brief for Respondent Duke 32. At another point in the NSPS regulations, a different definition of \"modification\" appeared: \"`Modification' means any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, an existing facility which increases the amount of any air pollutant (to which a standard applies) emitted into the atmosphere by that facility,\" \u00a7 60.2(h); see also <i>New York v. EPA,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></span>, 11-12 (C.A.D.C.2005) <i>(per curiam)</i> (\"[N]either the 1975 regulation nor its preamble explained why EPA found it necessary to offer these two separate glosses on `modification'\").</p>\n<p>[2]  Statutory PSD superseded a regulatory PSD scheme established by EPA in 1974. See 39 Fed.Reg. 42510. Under the regulations, the term \"modification\" was defined as \"any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the emission rate of any pollutant for which a national standard has been promulgated.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 42514.</p>\n<p>[3]  Although EPA had promulgated an earlier set of PSD regulations in 1978, 43 Fed.Reg. 26380, none of the parties argues that they govern the conduct at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>[4]  The United States argues that some of Duke's projects were governed by EPA's PSD regulations promulgated in 1992 rather than the 1980 PSD regulations. Brief for United States 20, n. 4. Duke disputes this. Brief for Respondent Duke 14, n. 4. Because the United States acknowledges that the two sets of regulations \"did not materially differ with respect to the legal question at issue here,\" Brief for United States 20, n. 4, we will assume, as did the Court of Appeals and the District Court, that the 1980 PSD regulations control. 411 F.3d, at 543, n. 1; <i>United States v. Duke Energy Corp.,</i> 278 F.Supp.2d 619, 629 (M.D.N.C.2003).</p>\n<p>[5]  The Court of Appeals noted that EPA was free to abandon the requirement that a \"modification\" be accompanied by an increase in the hourly rate of emissions, provided it did so for both the NSPS and PSD programs. 411 F.3d, at 550-551. In other words, the Court of Appeals raised no question about the reasonableness of the definition of \"modification\" in the 1980 PSD regulations, apart from its deviation from the definition contained in NSPS regulations.</p>\n<p>[6]  Duke argues that the 1977 amendments intended to incorporate EPA's definition of \"modification\" under the 1974 regulatory PSD program. Brief for Respondent Duke 44; see also n. 2, <i>supra.</i> We find no support for this argument in the statutory text, which refers to the statutory NSPS definition rather than the regulatory PSD definition. Although Duke correctly points out that \"Congress instructed that the bulk of the pre-existing rules `shall remain in effect,'\" Brief for Respondent Duke 44 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7478(a)), this instruction was a temporary measure \"[u]ntil such time as an applicable implementation plan is in effect,\" \u00a7 7478(a). We therefore do not read this language as a restriction on EPA's authority to interpret the statutory PSD provisions reasonably in a manner that departs from the 1974 regulations. Duke also invokes <i>Bragdon v. Abbott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118241\"><a href=\"/opinion/118241/bragdon-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 631, 118 S.Ct. 2196, 141 L.Ed.2d 540 (1998), for the proposition that \"use of the pre-existing term `modification' `carries the implication that Congress intended the term to be construed in accordance with pre-existing regulatory interpretations.'\" Brief for Respondent Duke 44. But this reasoning is unavailing here, given the existence of at least three distinct regulatory definitions of \"modification\" at the time of the 1977 amendments. See <i>supra,</i> at ___-___ 2-3, and nn. 1, 2.</p>\n<p>[7]  Two Courts of Appeals agree. See <i>United States v. Cinergy Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795303\"><a href=\"/opinion/795303/united-states-of-america-and-state-of-new-york-pla/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span>, 708 (C.A.7 2006) (\"[M]erely running the plant closer to its maximum capacity is not a major modification because it does not involve either a physical change or a change in the <i>method</i> of operation. If, however, a physical change enables the plant to increase its output, then, according to the EPA's interpretation, the exclusion for merely operating the plant for longer hours is inapplicable\" (emphasis in original)); <i>Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v. Reilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534850\"><a href=\"/opinion/534850/wisconsin-electric-power-company-v-william-k-reill/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></a></span>, 916, n. 11 (C.A.7 1990) (the regulatory exclusion for increases in the hours of operation \"was provided to allow facilities to take advantage of fluctuating market conditions, not construction or modification activity\"); <i>Puerto Rican Cement Co. v. EPA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532021\"><a href=\"/opinion/532021/puerto-rican-cement-company-inc-v-united-states-en/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 298 (C.A.1 1989) (\"[T]here is no logical contradiction in rules that, on the one hand, permit firms using <i>existing</i> capacity simply to increase their output and, on the other, use the potential output of <i>new</i> capacity as a basis for calculating an increase in emissions levels\" (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p>[8]  Duke now offers an alternative argument for applying the hourly emissions test for the PSD program: before a project can become a \"major modification\" under the PSD regulations, 40 CFR \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i) (1987), it must meet the definition of \"modification\" under the NSPS regulations, \u00a7 60.14(a). That sounds right, but the language of the regulations does not support it. For example, it would be superfluous for PSD regulations to require a \"major modification\" to be \"a physical change in or change in the method of operation,\" \u00a7 51.166(b)(2)(i), if they presupposed that the NSPS definition of \"modification,\" which contains the same prerequisite, \u00a7 60.14(a), had already been satisfied. The NSPS and PSD regulations are complementary and not related as set to subset.</p>\n\n</div>",
