Respected scientists believe the two trends are related. For when carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, it acts like the ceiling of a greenhouse, trapping solar energy and retarding the escape of reflected heat. It is therefore a species\u0097the most important species\u0097of a \"greenhouse gas.\"</p>\n<p>Calling global warming \"the most pressing environmental challenge of our time,\"<sup>[1]</sup> a group of States,<sup>[2]</sup> local governments,<sup>[3]</sup> and private organizations,<sup>[4]</sup> alleged in a petition for certiorari that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has abdicated its responsibility under the Clean Air Act to regulate the emissions of four greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. Specifically, petitioners asked us to answer two questions concerning the meaning of \u00a7 202(a)(1) of the Act: whether EPA has the statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles; and if so, whether its stated reasons for refusing to do so are consistent with the statute.</p>\n<p>In response, EPA, supported by 10 intervening States<sup>[5]</sup> and six trade associations,<sup>[6]</sup> correctly argued that we may not address those two questions unless at least one petitioner has standing to invoke our jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1447</span> Notwithstanding the serious character of that jurisdictional argument and the absence of any conflicting decisions construing \u00a7 202(a)(1), the unusual importance of the underlying issue persuaded us to grant the writ. 548 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2960, 165 L.Ed.2d 949 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Section 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as added by Pub.L. 89-272, \u00a7 101(8), 79 Stat. 992, and as amended by, <i>inter alia,</i> 84 Stat. 1690 and 91 Stat. 791, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1), provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The [EPA] Administrator shall by regulation prescribe (and from time to time revise) in accordance with the provisions of this section, standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which in his judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare ....\"<sup>[7]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>The Act defines \"air pollutant\" to include \"any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical, biological, radioactive ... substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.\" \u00a7 7602(g). \"Welfare\" is also defined broadly: among other things, it includes \"effects on ... weather... and climate.\" \u00a7 7602(h).</p>\n<p>When Congress enacted these provisions, the study of climate change was in its infancy.<sup>[8]</sup> In 1959, shortly after the U.S. Weather Bureau began monitoring atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, an observatory in Mauna Loa, Hawaii, recorded a mean level of 316 parts per million. This was well above the highest carbon dioxide concentration\u0097no more than 300 parts per million\u0097revealed in the 420,000-year-old ice-core record.<sup>[9]</sup> By the time Congress drafted \u00a7 202(a)(1) in 1970, carbon dioxide levels had reached 325 parts per million.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1448</span> In the late 1970's, the Federal Government began devoting serious attention to the possibility that carbon dioxide emissions associated with human activity could provoke climate change. In 1978, Congress enacted the National Climate Program Act, 92 Stat. 601, which required the President to establish a program to \"assist the Nation and the world to understand and respond to natural and man-induced climate processes and their implications,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 3. President Carter, in turn, asked the National Research Council, the working arm of the National Academy of Sciences, to investigate the subject. The Council's response was unequivocal: \"If carbon dioxide continues to increase, the study group finds no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible.... A wait-and-see policy may mean waiting until it is too late.\"<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Congress next addressed the issue in 1987, when it enacted the Global Climate Protection Act, Title XI of Pub.L. 100-204, 101 Stat. 1407, note following 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2901. Finding that \"manmade pollution\u0097the release of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and other trace gases into the atmosphere\u0097may be producing a long-term and substantial increase in the average temperature on Earth,\" \u00a7 1102(1), 101 Stat. 1408, Congress directed EPA to propose to Congress a \"coordinated national policy on global climate change,\" \u00a7 1103(b), and ordered the Secretary of State to work \"through the channels of multilateral diplomacy\" and coordinate diplomatic efforts to combat global warming, \u00a7 1103(c). Congress emphasized that \"ongoing pollution and deforestation may be contributing now to an irreversible process\" and that \"[n]ecessary actions must be identified and implemented in time to protect the climate.\" \u00a7 1102(4).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the scientific understanding of climate change progressed. In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a multinational scientific body organized under the auspices of the United Nations, published its first comprehensive report on the topic. Drawing on expert opinions from across the globe, the IPCC concluded that \"emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of... greenhouse gases [which] will enhance the greenhouse effect, resulting on average in an additional warming of the Earth's surface.\"<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Responding to the IPCC report, the United Nations convened the \"Earth Summit\" in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. The first President Bush attended and signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a nonbinding agreement among 154 nations to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases for the purpose of \"prevent[ing] dangerous anthropogenic [<i>i.e.,</i> human-induced] interference with the [Earth's] climate system.\"<sup>[13]</sup> S. Treaty Doc. No. 102-38, Art. 2, p. 5 (1992). The Senate unanimously ratified the treaty.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1449</span> Some five years later\u0097after the IPCC issued a second comprehensive report in 1995 concluding that \"[t]he balance of evidence suggests there is a discernible human influence on global climate\"<sup>[14]</sup>\u0097the UNFCCC signatories met in Kyoto, Japan, and adopted a protocol that assigned mandatory targets for industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Because those targets did not apply to developing and heavily polluting nations such as China and India, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution expressing its sense that the United States should not enter into the Kyoto Protocol. See S. Res. 98, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (July 25, 1997) (as passed). President Clinton did not submit the protocol to the Senate for ratification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>On October 20, 1999, a group of 19 private organizations<sup>[15]</sup> filed a rulemaking petition asking EPA to regulate \"greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under \u00a7 202 of the Clean Air Act.\" App. 5. Petitioners maintained that 1998 was the \"warmest year on record\"; that carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons are \"heat trapping greenhouse gases\"; that greenhouse gas emissions have significantly accelerated climate change; and that the IPCC's 1995 report warned that \"carbon dioxide remains the most important contributor to [man-made] forcing of climate change.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted). The petition further alleged that climate change will have serious adverse effects on human health and the environment. <i>Id.,</i> at 22-35. As to EPA's statutory authority, the petition observed that the agency itself had already confirmed that it had the power to regulate carbon dioxide. See <i>id.,</i> at 18, n. 21. In 1998, Jonathan Z. Cannon, then EPA's General Counsel, prepared a legal opinion concluding that \"CO2 emissions are within the scope of EPA's authority to regulate,\" even as he recognized that EPA had so far declined to exercise that authority. <i>Id.,</i> at 54 (memorandum to Carol M. Browner, Administrator (Apr. 10, 1998) (hereinafter Cannon memorandum)). Cannon's successor, Gary S. Guzy, reiterated that opinion before a congressional committee just two weeks before the rulemaking petition was filed. See <i>id.,</i> at 61.</p>\n<p>Fifteen months after the petition's submission, EPA requested public comment on \"all the issues raised in [the] petition,\" adding a \"particular\" request for comments on \"any scientific, technical, legal, economic or other aspect of these issues that may be relevant to EPA's consideration of this petition.\" 66 Fed.Reg. 7486, 7487 (2001). EPA received more than 50,000 comments over the next five months. See 68 Fed.Reg. 52924 (2003).</p>\n<p>Before the close of the comment period, the White House sought \"assistance in identifying the areas in the science of climate change where there are the greatest certainties and uncertainties\" from the National Research Council, asking for a response \"as soon as possible.\" App. 213. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1450</span> The result was a 2001 report titled Climate Change: An Analysis of Some Key Questions (NRC Report), which, drawing heavily on the 1995 IPCC report, concluded that \"[g]reenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. Temperatures are, in fact, rising.\" NRC Report 1.</p>\n<p>On September 8, 2003, EPA entered an order denying the rulemaking petition. 68 Fed.Reg. 52922. The agency gave two reasons for its decision: (1) that contrary to the opinions of its former general counsels, the Clean Air Act does not authorize EPA to issue mandatory regulations to address global climate change, see <i>id.,</i> at 52925-52929; and (2) that even if the agency had the authority to set greenhouse gas emission standards, it would be unwise to do so at this time, <i>id.,</i> at 52929-52931.</p>\n<p>In concluding that it lacked statutory authority over greenhouse gases, EPA observed that Congress \"was well aware of the global climate change issue when it last comprehensively amended the [Clean Air Act] in 1990,\" yet it declined to adopt a proposed amendment establishing binding emissions limitations. <i>Id.,</i> at 52926. Congress instead chose to authorize further investigation into climate change. <i>Ibid.</i> (citing \u00a7\u00a7 103(g) and 602(e) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 104 Stat. 2652, 2703, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7403(g)(1) and 7671a(e)). EPA further reasoned that Congress' \"specially tailored solutions to global atmospheric issues,\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52926\u0097in particular, its 1990 enactment of a comprehensive scheme to regulate pollutants that depleted the ozone layer, see Title VI, 104 Stat. 2649, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7671-7671q\u0097counseled against reading the general authorization of \u00a7 202(a)(1) to confer regulatory authority over greenhouse gases.</p>\n<p>EPA stated that it was \"urged on in this view\" by this Court's decision in <i>FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> 529 U.S. 120, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000). In that case, relying on \"tobacco['s] unique political history,\" <i>id.,</i> at 159, 120 S.Ct. 1291, we invalidated the Food and Drug Administration's reliance on its general authority to regulate drugs as a basis for asserting jurisdiction over an \"industry constituting a significant portion of the American economy,\" <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>EPA reasoned that climate change had its own \"political history\": Congress designed the original Clean Air Act to address <i>local</i> air pollutants rather than a substance that \"is fairly consistent in its concentration throughout the <i>world's</i> atmosphere,\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52927 (emphasis added); declined in 1990 to enact proposed amendments to force EPA to set carbon dioxide emission standards for motor vehicles, <i>ibid.</i> (citing H.R. 5966, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990)); and addressed global climate change in other legislation, 68 Fed. Reg. 52927. Because of this political history, and because imposing emission limitations on greenhouse gases would have even greater economic and political repercussions than regulating tobacco, EPA was persuaded that it lacked the power to do so. <i>Id.,</i> at 52928. In essence, EPA concluded that climate change was so important that unless Congress spoke with exacting specificity, it could not have meant the agency to address it.</p>\n<p>Having reached that conclusion, EPA believed it followed that greenhouse gases cannot be \"air pollutants\" within the meaning of the Act. See <i>ibid.</i> (\"It follows from this conclusion, that [greenhouse gases], as such, are not air pollutants under the [Clean Air Act's] regulatory provisions...\"). The agency bolstered this conclusion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1451</span> by explaining that if carbon dioxide were an air pollutant, the only feasible method of reducing tailpipe emissions would be to improve fuel economy. But because Congress has already created detailed mandatory fuel economy standards subject to Department of Transportation (DOT) administration, the agency concluded that EPA regulation would either conflict with those standards or be superfluous. <i>Id.,</i> at 52929.</p>\n<p>Even assuming that it had authority over greenhouse gases, EPA explained in detail why it would refuse to exercise that authority. The agency began by recognizing that the concentration of greenhouse gases has dramatically increased as a result of human activities, and acknowledged the attendant increase in global surface air temperatures. <i>Id.,</i> at 52930. EPA nevertheless gave controlling importance to the NRC Report's statement that a causal link between the two \"`cannot be unequivocally established.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting NRC Report 17). Given that residual uncertainty, EPA concluded that regulating greenhouse gas emissions would be unwise. 68 Fed.Reg. 52930.</p>\n<p>The agency furthermore characterized any EPA regulation of motor-vehicle emissions as a \"piecemeal approach\" to climate change, <i>id.,</i> at 52931, and stated that such regulation would conflict with the President's \"comprehensive approach\" to the problem, <i>id.,</i> at 52932. That approach involves additional support for technological innovation, the creation of nonregulatory programs to encourage voluntary private-sector reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and further research on climate change\u0097not actual regulation. <i>Id.,</i> at 52932-52933. According to EPA, unilateral EPA regulation of motor-vehicle greenhouse gas emissions might also hamper the President's ability to persuade key developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. <i>Id.,</i> at 52931.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Petitioners, now joined by intervenor States and local governments, sought review of EPA's order in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.<sup>[16]</sup> Although each of the three judges on the panel wrote a separate opinion, two judges agreed \"that the EPA Administrator properly exercised his discretion under \u00a7 202(a)(1) in denying the petition for rule making.\" 415 F.3d 50, 58 (2005). The court therefore denied the petition for review.</p>\n<p>In his opinion announcing the court's judgment, Judge Randolph avoided a definitive ruling as to petitioners' standing, <i>id.,</i> at 56, reasoning that it was permissible to proceed to the merits because the standing and the merits inquiries \"overlap[ped],\" <i>ibid.</i> Assuming without deciding that the statute authorized the EPA Administrator to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that \"in his judgment\" may \"reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1), Judge Randolph concluded that the exercise of that judgment need not be based solely on scientific evidence, but may also be informed by the sort of policy judgments that motivate congressional action. 415 F.3d, at 58. Given that framework, it was reasonable for EPA to base its decision on scientific uncertainty as well as on other factors, including the concern that unilateral regulation of U.S. motor-vehicle emissions could weaken efforts to reduce <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1452</span> greenhouse gas emissions from other countries. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Judge Sentelle wrote separately because he believed petitioners failed to \"demonstrat[e] the element of injury necessary to establish standing under Article III.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 59 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring in judgment). In his view, they had alleged that global warming is \"harmful to humanity at large,\" but could not allege \"particularized injuries\" to themselves. <i>Id.,</i> at 60 (citing <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 562, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)). While he dissented on standing, however, he accepted the contrary view as the law of the case and joined Judge Randolph's judgment on the merits as the closest to that which he preferred. 415 F.3d, at 60-61.</p>\n<p>Judge Tatel dissented. Emphasizing that EPA nowhere challenged the factual basis of petitioners' affidavits, <i>id.,</i> at 66, he concluded that at least Massachusetts had \"satisfied each element of Article III standing\u0097injury, causation, and redressability,\" <i>id.,</i> at 64. In Judge Tatel's view, the \"`substantial probability,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 66, that projected rises in sea level would lead to serious loss of coastal property was a \"far cry\" from the kind of generalized harm insufficient to ground Article III jurisdiction. <i>Id.,</i> at 65. He found that petitioners' affidavits more than adequately supported the conclusion that EPA's failure to curb greenhouse gas emissions contributed to the sea level changes that threatened Massachusetts' coastal property. <i>Ibid.</i> As to redressability, he observed that one of petitioners' experts, a former EPA climatologist, stated that \"`[a]chievable reductions in emissions of CO2 and other [greenhouse gases] from U.S. motor vehicles would ... delay and moderate many of the adverse impacts of global warming.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting declaration of Michael MacCracken, former Executive Director, U.S. Global Change Research Program \u00b6 5(e) (hereinafter MacCracken Decl.), available in 2 Petitioners' Standing Appendix in No. 03-1361, etc., (CADC), p. 209 (Stdg.App.)). He further noted that the one-time director of EPA's motor-vehicle pollution control efforts stated in an affidavit that enforceable emission standards would lead to the development of new technologies that \"`would gradually be mandated by other countries around the world.'\" 415 F.3d, at 66 (quoting declaration of Michael Walsh \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 10, Stdg. App. 309-310, 311). On the merits, Judge Tatel explained at length why he believed the text of the statute provided EPA with authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and why its policy concerns did not justify its refusal to exercise that authority. 415 F.3d, at 67-82.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Article III of the Constitution limits federal-court jurisdiction to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" Those two words confine \"the business of federal courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.\" <i>Flast v. Cohen,</i> 392 U.S. 83, 95, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). It is therefore familiar learning that no justiciable \"controversy\" exists when parties seek adjudication of a political question, <i>Luther v. Borden,</i> 7 How. 1, 12 L.Ed. 581 (1849), when they ask for an advisory opinion, <i>Hayburn's Case,</i> 2 Dall. 409, 1 L.Ed. 436 (1792), see also <i>Clinton v. Jones,</i> 520 U.S. 681, 700, n. 33, 117 S.Ct. 1636, 137 L.Ed.2d 945 (1997), or when the question sought to be adjudicated has been mooted by subsequent developments, <i>California v. San Pablo &amp; Tulare R. Co.,</i> 149 U.S. 308, 13 S.Ct. 876, 37 L.Ed. 747 (1893). This case suffers from none of these defects.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1453</span> The parties' dispute turns on the proper construction of a congressional statute, a question eminently suitable to resolution in federal court. Congress has moreover authorized this type of challenge to EPA action. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). That authorization is of critical importance to the standing inquiry: \"Congress has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before.\" <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S., at 580, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). \"In exercising this power, however, Congress must at the very least identify the injury it seeks to vindicate and relate the injury to the class of persons entitled to bring suit.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We will not, therefore, \"entertain citizen suits to vindicate the public's nonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the laws.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 581, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p>EPA maintains that because greenhouse gas emissions inflict widespread harm, the doctrine of standing presents an insuperable jurisdictional obstacle. We do not agree. At bottom, \"the gist of the question of standing\" is whether petitioners have \"such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination.\" <i>Baker v. Carr,</i> 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). As Justice KENNEDY explained in his <i>Lujan</i> concurrence:</p>\n<blockquote>\"While it does not matter how many persons have been injured by the challenged action, the party bringing suit must show that the action injures him in a concrete and personal way. This requirement is not just an empty formality. It preserves the vitality of the adversarial process by assuring both that the parties before the court have an actual, as opposed to professed, stake in the outcome, and that the legal questions presented ... will be resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.\" 504 U.S., at 581, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>To ensure the proper adversarial presentation, <i>Lujan</i> holds that a litigant must demonstrate that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent, that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant, and that it is likely that a favorable decision will redress that injury. See <i>id.,</i> at 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130. However, a litigant to whom Congress has \"accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests,\" <i>id.,</i> at 572, n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130\u0097here, the right to challenge agency action unlawfully withheld, \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u0097\"can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy,\" <i>ibid.</i> When a litigant is vested with a procedural right, that litigant has standing if there is some possibility that the requested relief will prompt the injury-causing party to reconsider the decision that allegedly harmed the litigant. <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Fla. v. Veneman,</i> 289 F.3d 89, 94-95 (C.A.D.C.2002) (\"A [litigant] who alleges a deprivation of a procedural protection to which he is entitled never has to prove that if he had received the procedure the substantive result would have been altered. All that is necessary is to show that the procedural step was connected to the substantive result\").</p>\n<p>Only one of the petitioners needs to have standing to permit us to consider the petition for review. See <i>Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.,</i> 547 U.S. 47, 52, n. 2, 126 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1454</span> 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006). We stress here, as did Judge Tatel below, the special position and interest of Massachusetts. It is of considerable relevance that the party seeking review here is a sovereign State and not, as it was in <i>Lujan,</i> a private individual.</p>\n<p>Well before the creation of the modern administrative state, we recognized that States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction. As Justice Holmes explained in <i>Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co.,</i> 206 U.S. 230, 237, 27 S.Ct. 618, 51 L.Ed. 1038 (1907), a case in which Georgia sought to protect its citizens from air pollution originating outside its borders:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The case has been argued largely as if it were one between two private parties; but it is not. The very elements that would be relied upon in a suit between fellow-citizens as a ground for equitable relief are wanting here. The State owns very little of the territory alleged to be affected, and the damage to it capable of estimate in money, possibly, at least, is small. This is a suit by a State for an injury to it in its capacity of <i>quasi</i>-sovereign. In that capacity the State has an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain. It has the last word as to whether its mountains shall be stripped of their forests and its inhabitants shall breathe pure air.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Just as Georgia's \"independent interest... in all the earth and air within its domain\" supported federal jurisdiction a century ago, so too does Massachusetts' well-founded desire to preserve its sovereign territory today. Cf. <i>Alden v. Maine,</i> 527 U.S. 706, 715, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999) (observing that in the federal system, the States \"are not relegated to the role of mere provinces or political corporations, but retain the dignity, though not the full authority, of sovereignty\"). That Massachusetts does in fact own a great deal of the \"territory alleged to be affected\" only reinforces the conclusion that its stake in the outcome of this case is sufficiently concrete to warrant the exercise of federal judicial power.</p>\n<p>When a State enters the Union, it surrenders certain sovereign prerogatives. Massachusetts cannot invade Rhode Island to force reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, it cannot negotiate an emissions treaty with China or India, and in some circumstances the exercise of its police powers to reduce in-state motor-vehicle emissions might well be pre-empted. See <i>Alfred L. Snapp &amp; Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez,</i> 458 U.S. 592, 607, 102 S.Ct. 3260, 73 L.Ed.2d 995 (1982) (\"One helpful indication in determining whether an alleged injury to the health and welfare of its citizens suffices to give the State standing to sue <i>parens patriae</i> is whether the injury is one that the State, if it could, would likely attempt to address through its sovereign lawmaking powers\").</p>\n<p>These sovereign prerogatives are now lodged in the Federal Government, and Congress has ordered EPA to protect Massachusetts (among others) by prescribing standards applicable to the \"emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicle engines, which in [the Administrator's] judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1). Congress has moreover recognized a concomitant procedural right to challenge the rejection of its rulemaking petition as arbitrary and capricious. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Given that procedural right and Massachusetts' stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign interests, the Commonwealth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1455</span> is entitled to special solicitude in our standing analysis.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>With that in mind, it is clear that petitioners' submissions as they pertain to Massachusetts have satisfied the most demanding standards of the adversarial process. EPA's steadfast refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions presents a risk of harm to Massachusetts that is both \"actual\" and \"imminent.\" <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S., at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted). There is, moreover, a \"substantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested\" will prompt EPA to take steps to reduce that risk. <i>Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc.,</i> 438 U.S. 59, 79, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Injury</i></h2>\n<p>The harms associated with climate change are serious and well recognized. Indeed, the NRC Report itself\u0097which EPA regards as an \"objective and independent assessment of the relevant science,\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52930\u0097identifies a number of environmental changes that have already inflicted significant harms, including \"the global retreat of mountain glaciers, reduction in snow-cover extent, the earlier spring melting of rivers and lakes, [and] the accelerated rate of rise of sea levels during the 20th century relative to the past few thousand years ....\" NRC Report 16.</p>\n<p>Petitioners allege that this only hints at the environmental damage yet to come. According to the climate scientist Michael <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1456</span> MacCracken, \"qualified scientific experts involved in climate change research\" have reached a \"strong consensus\" that global warming threatens (among other things) a precipitate rise in sea levels by the end of the century, MacCracken Decl. \u00b6 15, Stdg. App. 207, \"severe and irreversible changes to natural ecosystems,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 5(d), at 209, a \"significant reduction in water storage in winter snowpack in mountainous regions with direct and important economic consequences,\" <i>ibid.,</i> and an increase in the spread of disease, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 28, at 218-219. He also observes that rising ocean temperatures may contribute to the ferocity of hurricanes. <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 23-25, at 216-217.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>That these climate-change risks are \"widely shared\" does not minimize Massachusetts' interest in the outcome of this litigation. See <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Akins,</i> 524 U.S. 11, 24, 118 S.Ct. 1777, 141 L.Ed.2d 10 (1998) (\"[W]here a harm is concrete, though widely shared, the Court has found `injury in fact'\"). According to petitioners' unchallenged affidavits, global sea levels rose somewhere between 10 and 20 centimeters over the 20th century as a result of global warming. MacCracken Decl. \u00b6 5(c), Stdg.App. 208. These rising seas have already begun to swallow Massachusetts' coastal land. <i>Id.,</i> at 196 (declaration of Paul H. Kirshen \u00b6 5), 216 (MacCracken Decl. \u00b6 23). Because the Commonwealth \"owns a substantial portion of the state's coastal property,\" <i>id.,</i> at 171 (declaration of Karst R. Hoogeboom \u00b6 4),<sup>[19]</sup> it has alleged a particularized injury in its capacity as a landowner. The severity of that injury will only increase over the course of the next century: If sea levels continue to rise as predicted, one Massachusetts official believes that a significant fraction of coastal property will be \"either permanently lost through inundation or temporarily lost through periodic storm surge and flooding events.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 6, at 172.<sup>[20]</sup> Remediation costs alone, petitioners allege, could run well into the hundreds of millions of dollars. <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 7, at 172; see also Kirshen Decl. \u00b6 12, at 198.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1457</span> <i>Causation</i>\n</h2>\n<p>EPA does not dispute the existence of a causal connection between man-made greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. At a minimum, therefore, EPA's refusal to regulate such emissions \"contributes\" to Massachusetts' injuries.</p>\n<p>EPA nevertheless maintains that its decision not to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles contributes so insignificantly to petitioners' injuries that the agency cannot be haled into federal court to answer for them. For the same reason, EPA does not believe that any realistic possibility exists that the relief petitioners seek would mitigate global climate change and remedy their injuries. That is especially so because predicted increases in greenhouse gas emissions from developing nations, particularly China and India, are likely to offset any marginal domestic decrease.</p>\n<p>But EPA overstates its case. Its argument rests on the erroneous assumption that a small incremental step, because it is incremental, can never be attacked in a federal judicial forum. Yet accepting that premise would doom most challenges to regulatory action. Agencies, like legislatures, do not generally resolve massive problems in one fell regulatory swoop. See <i>Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,</i> 348 U.S. 483, 489, 75 S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955) (\"[A] reform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind\"). They instead whittle away at them over time, refining their preferred approach as circumstances change and as they develop a more-nuanced understanding of how best to proceed. Cf. <i>SEC v. Chenery Corp.,</i> 332 U.S. 194, 202, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) (\"Some principles must await their own development, while others must be adjusted to meet particular, unforeseeable situations\"). That a first step might be tentative does not by itself support the notion that federal courts lack jurisdiction to determine whether that step conforms to law.</p>\n<p>And reducing domestic automobile emissions is hardly a tentative step. Even leaving aside the other greenhouse gases, the United States transportation sector emits an enormous quantity of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere\u0097according to the MacCracken affidavit, more than 1.7 billion metric tons in 1999 alone. \u00b6 30, Stdg.App. 219. That accounts for more than 6% of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions. <i>Id.,</i> at 232 (Oppenheimer Decl. \u00b6 3); see also MacCracken Decl. \u00b6 31, at 220. To put this in perspective: Considering just emissions from the transportation sector, which represent less than one-third of this country's total carbon dioxide emissions, the United States would still rank as the third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, outpaced only by the European Union and China.<sup>[22]</sup> Judged by any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1458</span> standard, U.S. motor-vehicle emissions make a meaningful contribution to greenhouse gas concentrations and hence, according to petitioners, to global warming.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Remedy</i></h2>\n<p>While it may be true that regulating motor-vehicle emissions will not by itself <i>reverse</i> global warming, it by no means follows that we lack jurisdiction to decide whether EPA has a duty to take steps to <i>slow</i> or <i>reduce</i> it. See also <i>Larson v. Valente,</i> 456 U.S. 228, 244, n. 15, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982) (\"[A] plaintiff satisfies the redressability requirement when he shows that a favorable decision will relieve a discrete injury to himself. He need not show that a favorable decision will relieve his <i>every</i> injury\"). Because of the enormity of the potential consequences associated with man-made climate change, the fact that the effectiveness of a remedy might be delayed during the (relatively short) time it takes for a new motor-vehicle fleet to replace an older one is essentially irrelevant.<sup>[23]</sup> Nor is it dispositive that developing countries such as China and India are poised to increase greenhouse gas emissions substantially over the next century: A reduction in domestic emissions would slow the pace of global emissions increases, no matter what happens elsewhere.</p>\n<p>We moreover attach considerable significance to EPA's \"agree[ment] with the President that `we must address the issue of global climate change,'\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52929 (quoting remarks announcing Clear Skies and Global Climate Initiatives, 2002 Public Papers of George W. Bush, Vol. 1, Feb. 14, p. 227 (2004)), and to EPA's ardent support for various voluntary emission-reduction programs, 68 Fed.Reg. 52932. As Judge Tatel observed in dissent below, \"EPA would presumably not bother with such efforts if it thought emissions reductions would have no discernable impact on future global warming.\" 415 F.3d, at 66.</p>\n<p>In sum\u0097at least according to petitioners' uncontested affidavits\u0097the rise in sea levels associated with global warming has already harmed and will continue to harm Massachusetts. The risk of catastrophic harm, though remote, is nevertheless real. That risk would be reduced to some extent if petitioners received the relief they seek. We therefore hold that petitioners have standing to challenge the EPA's denial of their rulemaking petition.<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1459</span> V</h2>\n<p>The scope of our review of the merits of the statutory issues is narrow. As we have repeated time and again, an agency has broad discretion to choose how best to marshal its limited resources and personnel to carry out its delegated responsibilities. See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-845, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). That discretion is at its height when the agency decides not to bring an enforcement action. Therefore, in <i>Heckler v. Chaney,</i> 470 U.S. 821, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985), we held that an agency's refusal to initiate enforcement proceedings is not ordinarily subject to judicial review. Some debate remains, however, as to the rigor with which we review an agency's denial of a petition for rulemaking.</p>\n<p>There are key differences between a denial of a petition for rulemaking and an agency's decision not to initiate an enforcement action. See <i>American Horse Protection Assn., Inc. v. Lyng,</i> 812 F.2d 1, 3-4 (C.A.D.C.1987). In contrast to nonenforcement decisions, agency refusals to initiate rulemaking \"are less frequent, more apt to involve legal as opposed to factual analysis, and subject to special formalities, including a public explanation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 4; see also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555(e). They moreover arise out of denials of petitions for rulemaking which (at least in the circumstances here) the affected party had an undoubted procedural right to file in the first instance. Refusals to promulgate rules are thus susceptible to judicial review, though such review is \"extremely limited\" and \"highly deferential.\" <i>National Customs Brokers &amp; Forwarders Assn. of America, Inc. v. United States,</i> 883 F.2d 93, 96 (C.A.D.C.1989).</p>\n<p>EPA concluded in its denial of the petition for rulemaking that it lacked authority under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1) to regulate new vehicle emissions because carbon dioxide is not an \"air pollutant\" as that term is defined in \u00a7 7602. In the alternative, it concluded that even if it possessed authority, it would decline to do so because regulation would conflict with other administration priorities. As discussed earlier, the Clean Air Act expressly permits review of such an action. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). We therefore \"may reverse any such action found to be... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" \u00a7 7607(d)(9).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p>On the merits, the first question is whether \u00a7 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a \"judgment\" that such emissions contribute to climate change. We have little trouble concluding that it does. In relevant part, \u00a7 202(a)(1) provides that EPA \"shall by regulation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1460</span> prescribe ... standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which in [the Administrator's] judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1). Because EPA believes that Congress did not intend it to regulate substances that contribute to climate change, the agency maintains that carbon dioxide is not an \"air pollutant\" within the meaning of the provision.</p>\n<p>The statutory text forecloses EPA's reading. The Clean Air Act's sweeping definition of \"air pollutant\" includes \"<i>any</i> air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including <i>any</i> physical, chemical... substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air... .\" \u00a7 7602(g) (emphasis added). On its face, the definition embraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe, and underscores that intent through the repeated use of the word \"any.\"<sup>[25]</sup> Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons are without a doubt \"physical [and] chemical ... substance[s] which [are] emitted into ... the ambient air.\" The statute is unambiguous.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>Rather than relying on statutory text, EPA invokes postenactment congressional actions and deliberations it views as tantamount to a congressional command to refrain from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Even if such postenactment legislative history could shed light on the meaning of an otherwise-unambiguous statute, EPA never identifies any action remotely suggesting that Congress meant to curtail its power to treat greenhouse gases as air pollutants. That subsequent Congresses have eschewed enacting binding emissions limitations to combat global warming tells us nothing about what Congress meant when it amended \u00a7 202(a)(1) in 1970 and 1977.<sup>[27]</sup> And unlike EPA, we have no difficulty reconciling Congress' various efforts to promote interagency collaboration and research to better understand <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1461</span> climate change<sup>[28]</sup> with the agency's pre-existing mandate to regulate \"any air pollutant\" that may endanger the public welfare. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7601(a)(1). Collaboration and research do not conflict with any thoughtful regulatory effort; they complement it.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p>EPA's reliance on <i>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> 529 U.S. 120, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121, is similarly misplaced. In holding that tobacco products are not \"drugs\" or \"devices\" subject to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), see 529 U.S., at 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291, we found critical at least two considerations that have no counterpart in this case.</p>\n<p>First, we thought it unlikely that Congress meant to ban tobacco products, which the FDCA would have required had such products been classified as \"drugs\" or \"devices.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 135-137, 120 S.Ct. 1291. Here, in contrast, EPA jurisdiction would lead to no such extreme measures. EPA would only <i>regulate</i> emissions, and even then, it would have to delay any action \"to permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance,\" \u00a7 7521(a)(2). However much a ban on tobacco products clashed with the \"common sense\" intuition that Congress never meant to remove those products from circulation, <i>Brown &amp; Williamson,</i> 529 U.S., at 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291, there is nothing counterintuitive to the notion that EPA can curtail the emission of substances that are putting the global climate out of kilter.</p>\n<p>Second, in <i>Brown &amp; Williamson</i> we pointed to an unbroken series of congressional enactments that made sense only if adopted \"against the backdrop of the FDA's consistent and repeated statements that it lacked authority under the FDCA to regulate tobacco.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 144, 120 S.Ct. 1291. We can point to no such enactments here: EPA has not identified any congressional action that conflicts in any way with the regulation of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles. Even if it had, Congress could not have acted against a regulatory \"backdrop\" of disclaimers of regulatory authority. Prior to the order that provoked this litigation, EPA had never disavowed the authority to regulate greenhouse gases, and in 1998 it in fact affirmed that it <i>had</i> such authority. See App. 54 (Cannon memorandum). There is no reason, much less a compelling reason, to accept EPA's invitation to read ambiguity into a clear statute.</p>\n<p>EPA finally argues that it cannot regulate carbon dioxide emissions from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1462</span> motor vehicles because doing so would require it to tighten mileage standards, a job (according to EPA) that Congress has assigned to DOT. See 68 Fed.Reg. 52929. But that DOT sets mileage standards in no way licenses EPA to shirk its environmental responsibilities. EPA has been charged with protecting the public's \"health\" and \"welfare,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1), a statutory obligation wholly independent of DOT's mandate to promote energy efficiency. See Energy Policy and Conservation Act, \u00a7 2(5), 89 Stat. 874, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6201(5). The two obligations may overlap, but there is no reason to think the two agencies cannot both administer their obligations and yet avoid inconsistency.</p>\n<p>While the Congresses that drafted \u00a7 202(a)(1) might not have appreciated the possibility that burning fossil fuels could lead to global warming, they did understand that without regulatory flexibility, changing circumstances and scientific developments would soon render the Clean Air Act obsolete. The broad language of \u00a7 202(a)(1) reflects an intentional effort to confer the flexibility necessary to forestall such obsolescence. See <i>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey,</i> 524 U.S. 206, 212, 118 S.Ct. 1952, 141 L.Ed.2d 215 (1998) (\"[T]he fact that a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It demonstrates breadth\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because greenhouse gases fit well within the Clean Air Act's capacious definition of \"air pollutant,\" we hold that EPA has the statutory authority to regulate the emission of such gases from new motor vehicles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII</h2>\n<p>The alternative basis for EPA's decision\u0097that even if it does have statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gases, it would be unwise to do so at this time\u0097rests on reasoning divorced from the statutory text. While the statute does condition the exercise of EPA's authority on its formation of a \"judgment,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1), that judgment must relate to whether an air pollutant \"cause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\" <i>ibid.</i> Put another way, the use of the word \"judgment\" is not a roving license to ignore the statutory text. It is but a direction to exercise discretion within defined statutory limits.</p>\n<p>If EPA makes a finding of endangerment, the Clean Air Act requires the agency to regulate emissions of the deleterious pollutant from new motor vehicles. <i>Ibid.</i> (stating that \"[EPA] shall by regulation prescribe ... standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class of new motor vehicles\"). EPA no doubt has significant latitude as to the manner, timing, content, and coordination of its regulations with those of other agencies. But once EPA has responded to a petition for rulemaking, its reasons for action or inaction must conform to the authorizing statute. Under the clear terms of the Clean Air Act, EPA can avoid taking further action only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do. <i>Ibid.</i> To the extent that this constrains agency discretion to pursue other priorities of the Administrator or the President, this is the congressional design.</p>\n<p>EPA has refused to comply with this clear statutory command. Instead, it has offered a laundry list of reasons not to regulate. For example, EPA said that a number of voluntary executive branch programs already provide an effective response to the threat of global warming, 68 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1463</span> Fed.Reg. 52932, that regulating greenhouse gases might impair the President's ability to negotiate with \"key developing nations\" to reduce emissions, <i>id.,</i> at 52931, and that curtailing motor-vehicle emissions would reflect \"an inefficient, piecemeal approach to address the climate change issue,\" <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Although we have neither the expertise nor the authority to evaluate these policy judgments, it is evident they have nothing to do with whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change. Still less do they amount to a reasoned justification for declining to form a scientific judgment. In particular, while the President has broad authority in foreign affairs, that authority does not extend to the refusal to execute domestic laws. In the Global Climate Protection Act of 1987, Congress authorized the State Department\u0097not EPA\u0097to formulate United States foreign policy with reference to environmental matters relating to climate. See \u00a7 1103(c), 101 Stat. 1409. EPA has made no showing that it issued the ruling in question here after consultation with the State Department. Congress did direct EPA to consult with other agencies in the formulation of its policies and rules, but the State Department is absent from that list. \u00a7 1103(b).</p>\n<p>Nor can EPA avoid its statutory obligation by noting the uncertainty surrounding various features of climate change and concluding that it would therefore be better not to regulate at this time. See 68 Fed.Reg. 52930-52931. If the scientific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment as to whether greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, EPA must say so. That EPA would prefer not to regulate greenhouse gases because of some residual uncertainty\u0097which, contrary to Justice SCALIA's apparent belief, <i>post,</i> at 1466-1468, is in fact all that it said, see 68 Fed.Reg. 52929 (\"We do not believe ... that it would be either effective or appropriate for EPA <i>to establish [greenhouse gas] standards for motor vehicles</i> at this time\" (emphasis added))\u0097is irrelevant. The statutory question is whether sufficient information exists to make an endangerment finding.</p>\n<p>In short, EPA has offered no reasoned explanation for its refusal to decide whether greenhouse gases cause or contribute to climate change. Its action was therefore \"arbitrary, capricious, ... or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(9)(A). We need not and do not reach the question whether on remand EPA must make an endangerment finding, or whether policy concerns can inform EPA's actions in the event that it makes such a finding. Cf. <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We hold only that EPA must ground its reasons for action or inaction in the statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VIII</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice SCALIA, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Global warming may be a \"crisis,\" even \"the most pressing environmental problem of our time.\" Pet. for Cert. 26, 22. Indeed, it may ultimately affect nearly everyone on the planet in some potentially adverse way, and it may be that governments have done too little to address it. It is not a problem, however, that has escaped the attention of policymakers in the Executive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1464</span> and Legislative Branches of our Government, who continue to consider regulatory, legislative, and treaty-based means of addressing global climate change.</p>\n<p>Apparently dissatisfied with the pace of progress on this issue in the elected branches, petitioners have come to the courts claiming broad-ranging injury, and attempting to tie that injury to the Government's alleged failure to comply with a rather narrow statutory provision. I would reject these challenges as nonjusticiable. Such a conclusion involves no judgment on whether global warming exists, what causes it, or the extent of the problem. Nor does it render petitioners without recourse. This Court's standing jurisprudence simply recognizes that redress of grievances of the sort at issue here \"is the function of Congress and the Chief Executive,\" not the federal courts. <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 576, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). I would vacate the judgment below and remand for dismissal of the petitions for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution limits the federal judicial power to the adjudication of \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" \"If a dispute is not a proper case or controversy, the courts have no business deciding it, or expounding the law in the course of doing so.\" <i>DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno,</i> 547 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 1854, 1860-1861, 164 L.Ed.2d 589 (2006). \"Standing to sue is part of the common understanding of what it takes to make a justiciable case,\" <i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 102, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998), and has been described as \"an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III,\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p>Our modern framework for addressing standing is familiar: \"A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" <i>DaimlerChrysler, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1861 (quoting <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Applying that standard here, petitioners bear the burden of alleging an injury that is fairly traceable to the Environmental Protection Agency's failure to promulgate new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards, and that is likely to be redressed by the prospective issuance of such standards.</p>\n<p>Before determining whether petitioners can meet this familiar test, however, the Court changes the rules. It asserts that \"States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,\" and that given \"Massachusetts' stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign interests, the Commonwealth is entitled to <i>special solicitude</i> in our standing analysis.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1454, 1455 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Relaxing Article III standing requirements because asserted injuries are pressed by a State, however, has no basis in our jurisprudence, and support for any such \"special solicitude\" is conspicuously absent from the Court's opinion. The general judicial review provision cited by the Court, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1), affords States no special rights or status. The Court states that \"Congress has ordered EPA to protect Massachusetts (among others)\" through the statutory provision at issue, \u00a7 7521(a)(1), and that \"Congress has... recognized a concomitant procedural right to challenge the rejection of its rule-making petition as arbitrary and capricious.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1454. The reader might think from this unfortunate phrasing that Congress said something about the rights <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1465</span> of States in this particular provision of the statute. Congress knows how to do that when it wants to, see, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 7426(b) (affording States the right to petition EPA to directly regulate certain sources of pollution), but it has done nothing of the sort here. Under the law on which petitioners rely, Congress treated public and private litigants exactly the same.</p>\n<p>Nor does the case law cited by the Court provide any support for the notion that Article III somehow implicitly treats public and private litigants differently. The Court has to go back a full century in an attempt to justify its novel standing rule, but even there it comes up short. The Court's analysis hinges on <i>Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co.,</i> 206 U.S. 230, 27 S.Ct. 618, 51 L.Ed. 1038 (1907)\u0097a case that did indeed draw a distinction between a State and private litigants, but solely with respect to available remedies. The case had nothing to do with Article III standing.</p>\n<p>In <i>Tennessee Copper,</i> the State of Georgia sought to enjoin copper companies in neighboring Tennessee from discharging pollutants that were inflicting \"a wholesale destruction of forests, orchards and crops\" in bordering Georgia counties. <i>Id.,</i> at 236, 27 S.Ct. 618. Although the State owned very little of the territory allegedly affected, the Court reasoned that Georgia\u0097in its capacity as a \"<i>quasi</i>-sovereign\"\u0097\"has an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 237, 27 S.Ct. 618. The Court explained that while \"[t]he very elements that would be relied upon in a suit between fellow-citizens as a ground for equitable relief [were] wanting,\" a State \"is not lightly to be required to give up <i>quasi</i>-sovereign rights for pay.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Thus while a complaining private litigant would have to make do with a <i>legal</i> remedy\u0097one \"for pay\"\u0097the State was entitled to <i>equitable</i> relief. See <i>id.,</i> at 237-238, 27 S.Ct. 618.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the present case, there was no question in <i>Tennessee Copper</i> about Article III injury. See <i>id.,</i> at 238-239, 27 S.Ct. 618. There was certainly no suggestion that the State could show standing where the private parties could not; there was no dispute, after all, that the private landowners had \"an action at law.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 238, 27 S.Ct. 618. <i>Tennessee Copper</i> has since stood for nothing more than a State's right, in an original jurisdiction action, to sue in a representative capacity as <i>parens patriae.</i> See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Maryland v. Louisiana,</i> 451 U.S. 725, 737, 101 S.Ct. 2114, 68 L.Ed.2d 576 (1981). Nothing about a State's ability to sue in that capacity dilutes the bedrock requirement of showing injury, causation, and redressability to satisfy Article III.</p>\n<p>A claim of <i>parens patriae</i> standing is distinct from an allegation of direct injury. See <i>Wyoming v. Oklahoma,</i> 502 U.S. 437, 448-449, 451, 112 S.Ct. 789, 117 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992). Far from being a substitute for Article III injury, <i>parens patriae</i> actions raise an additional hurdle for a state litigant: the articulation of a \"quasi-sovereign interest\" \"<i>apart</i> from the interests of particular private parties.\" <i>Alfred L. Snapp &amp; Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez,</i> 458 U.S. 592, 607, 102 S.Ct. 3260, 73 L.Ed.2d 995 (1982) (emphasis added) (cited <i>ante,</i> at 1454). Just as an association suing on behalf of its members must show not only that it represents the members but that at least one satisfies Article III requirements, so too a State asserting quasi-sovereign interests as <i>parens patriae</i> must still show that its citizens satisfy Article III. Focusing on Massachusetts's interests as quasi-sovereign makes the required showing here harder, not easier. The Court, in effect, takes what has always been regarded as a <i>necessary</i> condition for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1466</span> <i>parens patriae</i> standing\u0097a quasi-sovereign interest\u0097and converts it into a <i>sufficient</i> showing for purposes of Article III.</p>\n<p>What is more, the Court's reasoning falters on its own terms. The Court asserts that Massachusetts is entitled to \"special solicitude\" due to its \"quasi-sovereign interests,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1455, but then applies our Article III standing test to the asserted injury of the State's loss of coastal property. See <i>ante,</i> at 1456 (concluding that Massachusetts \"has alleged a particularized injury <i>in its capacity as a landowner</i>\" (emphasis added)). In the context of <i>parens patriae</i> standing, however, we have characterized state ownership of land as a \"nonsovereign interes[t]\" because a State \"is likely to have the same interests as other similarly situated proprietors.\" <i>Alfred L. Snapp &amp; Son, supra,</i> at 601, 102 S.Ct. 3260.</p>\n<p>On top of everything else, the Court overlooks the fact that our cases cast significant doubt on a State's standing to assert a quasi-sovereign interest\u0097as opposed to a direct injury\u0097against the Federal Government. As a general rule, we have held that while a State might assert a quasi-sovereign right as <i>parens patriae</i> \"for the protection of its citizens, it is no part of its duty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the Federal Government. In that field it is the United States, and not the State, which represents them.\" <i>Massachusetts v. Mellon,</i> 262 U.S. 447, 485-486, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923) (citation omitted); see also <i>Alfred L. Snapp &amp; Son, supra,</i> at 610, n. 16, 102 S.Ct. 3260.</p>\n<p>All of this presumably explains why petitioners never cited <i>Tennessee Copper</i> in their briefs before this Court or the D.C. Circuit. It presumably explains why not one of the legion of <i>amici</i> supporting petitioners ever cited the case. And it presumably explains why not one of the three judges writing below ever cited the case either. Given that one purpose of the standing requirement is \"`to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 1452-1453 (quoting <i>Baker v. Carr,</i> 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962)), it is ironic that the Court today adopts a new theory of Article III standing for States without the benefit of briefing or argument on the point.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>It is not at all clear how the Court's \"special solicitude\" for Massachusetts plays out in the standing analysis, except as an implicit concession that petitioners cannot establish standing on traditional terms. But the status of Massachusetts as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1467</span> a State cannot compensate for petitioners' failure to demonstrate injury in fact, causation, and redressability.</p>\n<p>When the Court actually applies the three-part test, it focuses, as did the dissent below, see 415 F.3d 50, 64 (C.A.D.C.2005) (opinion of Tatel, J.), on the State's asserted loss of coastal land as the injury in fact. If petitioners rely on loss of land as the Article III injury, however, they must ground the rest of the standing analysis in that specific injury. That alleged injury must be \"concrete and particularized,\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S., at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, and \"distinct and palpable,\" <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S., at 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315 (internal quotation marks omitted). Central to this concept of \"particularized\" injury is the requirement that a plaintiff be affected in a \"personal and individual way,\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S., at 560, n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 2130, and seek relief that \"directly and tangibly benefits him\" in a manner distinct from its impact on \"the public at large,\" <i>id.,</i> at 573-574, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Without \"particularized injury, there can be no confidence of `a real need to exercise the power of judicial review' or that relief can be framed `no broader than required by the precise facts to which the court's ruling would be applied.'\" <i>Warth v. Seldin,</i> 422 U.S. 490, 508, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (quoting <i>Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,</i> 418 U.S. 208, 221-222, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974)).</p>\n<p>The very concept of global warming seems inconsistent with this particularization requirement. Global warming is a phenomenon \"harmful to humanity at large,\" 415 F.3d, at 60 (Sentelle, J., dissenting in part and concurring in judgment), and the redress petitioners seek is focused no more on them than on the public generally\u0097it is literally to change the atmosphere around the world.</p>\n<p>If petitioners' particularized injury is loss of coastal land, it is also that injury that must be \"actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted), \"real and immediate,\" <i>Los Angeles v. Lyons,</i> 461 U.S. 95, 102, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted), and \"certainly impending,\" <i>Whitmore v. Arkansas,</i> 495 U.S. 149, 158, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>As to \"actual\" injury, the Court observes that \"global sea levels rose somewhere between 10 and 20 centimeters over the 20th century as a result of global warming\" and that \"[t]hese rising seas have already begun to swallow Massachusetts' coastal land.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1456. But none of petitioners' declarations supports that connection. One declaration states that \"a rise in sea level due to climate change is occurring on the coast of Massachusetts, in the metropolitan Boston area,\" but there is no elaboration. Petitioners' Standing Appendix in No. 03-1361, etc. (CADC), p. 196 (Stdg.App.). And the declarant goes on to identify a \"significan[t]\" <i>non</i>-global-warming cause of Boston's rising sea level: land subsidence. <i>Id.,</i> at 197; see also <i>id.,</i> at 216. Thus, aside from a single conclusory statement, there is nothing in petitioners' 43 standing declarations and accompanying exhibits to support an inference of actual loss of Massachusetts coastal land from 20th century global sea level increases. It is pure conjecture.</p>\n<p>The Court's attempts to identify \"imminent\" or \"certainly impending\" loss of Massachusetts coastal land fares no better. See <i>ante,</i> at 1456-1457. One of petitioners' declarants predicts global warming will cause sea level to rise by 20 to 70 centimeters <i>by the year 2100.</i> Stdg.App. 216. Another uses a computer modeling <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1468</span> program to map the Commonwealth's coastal land and its current elevation, and calculates that the high-end estimate of sea level rise would result in the loss of significant state-owned coastal land. <i>Id.,</i> at 179. But the computer modeling program has a conceded average error of about 30 centimeters and a maximum observed error of 70 centimeters. <i>Id.,</i> at 177-178. As an initial matter, if it is possible that the model underrepresents the elevation of coastal land to an extent equal to or in excess of the projected sea level rise, it is difficult to put much stock in the predicted loss of land. But even placing that problem to the side, accepting a century-long time horizon and a series of compounded estimates renders requirements of imminence and immediacy utterly toothless. See <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 565, n. 2, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (while the concept of \"`imminence'\" in standing doctrine is \"somewhat elastic,\" it can be \"stretched beyond the breaking point\"). \"Allegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Art. III. A threatened injury must be <i>certainly impending</i> to constitute injury in fact.\" <i>Whitmore, supra,</i> at 158, 110 S.Ct. 1717. (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Petitioners' reliance on Massachusetts's loss of coastal land as their injury in fact for standing purposes creates insurmountable problems for them with respect to causation and redressability. To establish standing, petitioners must show a causal connection between that specific injury and the lack of new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards, and that the promulgation of such standards would likely redress that injury. As is often the case, the questions of causation and redressability overlap. See <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S., at 753, n. 19, 104 S.Ct. 3315 (observing that the two requirements were \"initially articulated by this Court as two facets of a single causation requirement\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). And importantly, when a party is challenging the Government's allegedly unlawful regulation, or lack of regulation, of a third party, satisfying the causation and redressability requirements becomes \"substantially more difficult.\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 562, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Warth, supra,</i> at 504-505, 95 S.Ct. 2197.</p>\n<p>Petitioners view the relationship between their injuries and EPA's failure to promulgate new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards as simple and direct: Domestic motor vehicles emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and therefore also to petitioners' alleged injuries. Without the new vehicle standards, greenhouse gas emissions\u0097and therefore global warming and its attendant harms\u0097have been higher than they otherwise would have been; once EPA changes course, the trend will be reversed.</p>\n<p>The Court ignores the complexities of global warming, and does so by now disregarding the \"particularized\" injury it relied on in step one, and using the dire nature of global warming itself as a bootstrap for finding causation and redressability. First, it is important to recognize the extent of the emissions at issue here. Because local greenhouse gas emissions disperse throughout the atmosphere and remain there for anywhere from 50 to 200 years, it is global emissions data that are relevant. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-73. According to one of petitioners' declarations, domestic motor vehicles contribute about 6 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions and 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Stdg.App. 232. The amount of global emissions at issue here is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1469</span> smaller still; \u00a7 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act covers only <i>new</i> motor vehicles and <i>new</i> motor vehicle engines, so petitioners' desired emission standards might reduce only a fraction of 4 percent of global emissions.</p>\n<p>This gets us only to the relevant greenhouse gas emissions; linking them to global warming and ultimately to petitioners' alleged injuries next requires consideration of further complexities. As EPA explained in its denial of petitioners' request for rulemaking,</p>\n<blockquote>\"predicting future climate change necessarily involves a complex web of economic and physical factors including: our ability to predict future global anthropogenic emissions of [greenhouse gases] and aerosols; the fate of these emissions once they enter the atmosphere (e.g., what percentage are absorbed by vegetation or are taken up by the oceans); the impact of those emissions that remain in the atmosphere on the radiative properties of the atmosphere; changes in critically important climate feedbacks (e.g., changes in cloud cover and ocean circulation); changes in temperature characteristics (e.g., average temperatures, shifts in daytime and evening temperatures); changes in other climatic parameters (e.g., shifts in precipitation, storms); and ultimately the impact of such changes on human health and welfare (e.g., increases or decreases in agricultural productivity, human health impacts).\" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-83 through A-84.</blockquote>\n<p>Petitioners are never able to trace their alleged injuries back through this complex web to the fractional amount of global emissions that might have been limited with EPA standards. In light of the bit-part domestic new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions have played in what petitioners describe as a 150-year global phenomenon, and the myriad additional factors bearing on petitioners' alleged injury\u0097the loss of Massachusetts coastal land\u0097the connection is far too speculative to establish causation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Redressability is even more problematic. To the tenuous link between petitioners' alleged injury and the indeterminate fractional domestic emissions at issue here, add the fact that petitioners cannot meaningfully predict what will come of the 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions that originate outside the United States. As the Court acknowledges, \"developing countries such as China and India are poised to increase greenhouse gas emissions substantially over the next century,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1458, so the domestic emissions at issue here may become an increasingly marginal portion of global emissions, and any decreases produced by petitioners' desired standards are likely to be overwhelmed many times over by emissions increases elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p>Petitioners offer declarations attempting to address this uncertainty, contending that \"[i]f the U.S. takes steps to reduce motor vehicle emissions, other countries are very likely to take similar actions regarding their own motor vehicles using technology developed in response to the U.S. program.\" Stdg.App. 220; see also <i>id.,</i> at 311-312. In other words, do not worry that other countries will contribute far more to global warming than will U.S. automobile emissions; someone is bound to invent something, and places like the People's Republic of China or India will surely require use of the new technology, regardless of cost. The Court previously has explained that when the existence of an element of standing \"depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and whose <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1470</span> exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to control or to predict,\" a party must present facts supporting an assertion that the actor will proceed in such a manner. <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S., at 562, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (quoting <i>ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish,</i> 490 U.S. 605, 615, 109 S.Ct. 2037, 104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989) (opinion of KENNEDY, J.); internal quotation marks omitted). The declarations' conclusory (not to say fanciful) statements do not even come close.</p>\n<p>No matter, the Court reasons, because <i>any</i> decrease in domestic emissions will \"slow the pace of global emissions increases, no matter what happens elsewhere.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1458. Every little bit helps, so Massachusetts can sue over any little bit.</p>\n<p>The Court's sleight-of-hand is in failing to link up the different elements of the three-part standing test. What must be <i>likely</i> to be redressed is the particular injury in fact. The injury the Court looks to is the asserted loss of land. The Court contends that regulating domestic motor vehicle emissions will reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, <i>and therefore</i> redress Massachusetts's injury. But even if regulation <i>does</i> reduce emissions\u0097to some indeterminate degree, given events elsewhere in the world\u0097the Court never explains why that makes it <i>likely</i> that the injury in fact\u0097the loss of land\u0097will be redressed. Schoolchildren know that a kingdom might be lost \"all for the want of a horseshoe nail,\" but \"likely\" redressability is a different matter. The realities make it pure conjecture to suppose that EPA regulation of new automobile emissions will <i>likely</i> prevent the loss of Massachusetts coastal land.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Petitioners' difficulty in demonstrating causation and redressability is not surprising given the evident mismatch between the source of their alleged injury\u0097catastrophic global warming\u0097and the narrow subject matter of the Clean Air Act provision at issue in this suit. The mismatch suggests that petitioners' true goal for this litigation may be more symbolic than anything else. The constitutional role of the courts, however, is to decide concrete cases\u0097not to serve as a convenient forum for policy debates. See <i>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</i> 454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (\"[Standing] tends to assure that the legal questions presented to the court will be resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action\").</p>\n<p>When dealing with legal doctrine phrased in terms of what is \"fairly\" traceable or \"likely\" to be redressed, it is perhaps not surprising that the matter is subject to some debate. But in considering how loosely or rigorously to define those adverbs, it is vital to keep in mind the purpose of the inquiry. The limitation of the judicial power to cases and controversies \"is crucial in maintaining the tripartite allocation of power set forth in the Constitution.\" <i>DaimlerChrysler,</i> 547 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1860-1861 (internal quotation marks omitted). In my view, the Court today\u0097addressing Article III's \"core component of standing,\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130\u0097fails to take this limitation seriously.</p>\n<p>To be fair, it is not the first time the Court has done so. Today's decision recalls the previous high-water mark of diluted standing requirements, <i>United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP),</i> 412 U.S. 669, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1471</span> <i>SCRAP</i> involved \"[p]robably the most attenuated injury conferring Art. III standing\" and \"surely went to the very outer limit of the law\"\u0097until today. <i>Whitmore,</i> 495 U.S., at 158-159, 110 S.Ct. 1717; see also <i>Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation,</i> 497 U.S. 871, 889, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990) (<i>SCRAP</i> \"has never since been emulated by this Court\"). In <i>SCRAP,</i> the Court based an environmental group's standing to challenge a railroad freight rate surcharge on the group's allegation that increases in railroad rates would cause an increase in the use of nonrecyclable goods, resulting in the increased need for natural resources to produce such goods. According to the group, some of these resources might be taken from the Washington area, resulting in increased refuse that might find its way into area parks, harming the group's members. 412 U.S., at 688, 93 S.Ct. 2405.</p>\n<p>Over time, <i>SCRAP</i> became emblematic not of the looseness of Article III standing requirements, but of how utterly manipulable they are if not taken seriously as a matter of judicial self-restraint. <i>SCRAP</i> made standing seem a lawyer's game, rather than a fundamental limitation ensuring that courts function as courts and not intrude on the politically accountable branches. Today's decision is <i>SCRAP</i> for a new generation.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Perhaps the Court recognizes as much. How else to explain its need to devise a new doctrine of state standing to support its result? The good news is that the Court's \"special solicitude\" for Massachusetts limits the future applicability of the diluted standing requirements applied in this case. The bad news is that the Court's self-professed relaxation of those Article III requirements has caused us to transgress \"the proper\u0097and properly limited\u0097role of the courts in a democratic society.\" <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S., at 750, 104 S.Ct. 3315 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I join THE CHIEF JUSTICE's opinion in full, and would hold that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide this case because petitioners lack standing.

As the Court recognizes, the statute \"condition[s] the exercise of EPA's authority on its formation of a `judgment.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1462. There is no dispute that the Administrator has made no such judgment in this case. See <i>ante,</i> at 1463 (\"We need not and do not reach the question whether on remand EPA must make an endangerment finding\"); 68 Fed. 52929 (2003) (\"[N]o Administrator has made a finding under any of the CAA's regulatory provisions that CO2 meets the applicable statutory criteria for regulation\").</p>\n<p>The question thus arises: Does anything <i>require</i> the Administrator to make a \"judgment\" whenever a petition for rulemaking is filed? Without citation of the statute or any other authority, the Court says yes. Why is that so? When Congress wishes to make private action force an agency's hand, it knows how to do so. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Brock v. Pierce County,</i> 476 U.S. 253, 254-255, 106 S.Ct. 1834, 90 L.Ed.2d 248 (1986) (discussing the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), 92 Stat. 1926, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(b) (1976 ed., Supp. V), which \"provide[d] that the Secretary of Labor `shall' issue a final determination as to the misuse of CETA funds by a grant recipient within 120 days after receiving a complaint alleging such misuse\"). Where does the CAA say that the EPA Administrator is required to come to a decision on this question whenever a rulemaking petition is filed? The Court points to no such provision because none exists.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Court invents a multiple-choice question that the EPA Administrator must answer when a petition for rulemaking is filed. The Administrator must exercise his judgment in one of three ways: (a) by concluding that the pollutant <i>does</i> cause, or contribute to, air pollution that endangers public welfare (in which case EPA is required to regulate); (b) by concluding that the pollutant <i>does not</i> cause, or contribute to, air pollution that endangers public welfare (in which case EPA is <i>not</i> required to regulate); or (c) by \"provid[ing] some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether\" greenhouse gases endanger public welfare, <i>ante,</i> at 1462, (in which case EPA is <i>not</i> required to regulate).</p>\n<p>I am willing to assume, for the sake of argument, that the Administrator's discretion in this regard is not entirely unbounded\u0097that if he has no reasonable basis for deferring judgment he must grasp the nettle at once. The Court, however, with no basis in text or precedent, rejects all of EPA's stated \"policy judgments\" as not \"amount[ing] to a reasoned justification,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1463, effectively narrowing the universe of potential reasonable bases to a single one: Judgment can be delayed <i>only</i> if the Administrator concludes that \"the scientific uncertainty is [too] profound.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Administrator is precluded from concluding <i>for other reasons</i> \"that it would. . . be better not to regulate at this time.\" <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[1]</sup> Such other reasons\u0097perfectly valid reasons\u0097were set forth in the agency's statement.</p>\n<blockquote>\"We do not believe . . . that it would be either effective or appropriate for EPA to establish [greenhouse gas] standards for motor vehicles at this time. As described in detail below, the President has laid out a comprehensive approach <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1473</span> to climate change that calls for near-term voluntary actions and incentives along with programs aimed at reducing scientific uncertainties and encouraging technological development so that the government may effectively and efficiently address the climate change issue over the long term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[E]stablishing [greenhouse gas] emission standards for U.S. motor vehicles at this time would . . . result in an inefficient, piecemeal approach to addressing the climate change issue. The U.S. motor vehicle fleet is one of many sources of [greenhouse gas] emissions both here and abroad, and different [greenhouse gas] emission sources face different technological and financial challenges in reducing emissions. A sensible regulatory scheme would require that all significant sources and sinks of [greenhouse gas] emissions be considered in deciding how best to achieve any needed emission reductions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Unilateral EPA regulation of motor vehicle [greenhouse gas] emissions could also weaken U.S. efforts to persuade developing countries to reduce the [greenhouse gas] intensity of their economies. Considering the large populations and growing economies of some developing countries, increases in their [greenhouse gas] emissions could quickly overwhelm the effects of [greenhouse gas] reduction measures in developed countries. Any potential benefit of EPA regulation could be lost to the extent other nations decided to let their emissions significantly increase in view of U.S. emissions reductions. Unavoidably, climate change raises important foreign policy issues, and it is the President's prerogative to address them.\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52929-52931 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>The Court dismisses this analysis as \"rest[ing] on reasoning divorced from the statutory text.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1462. \"While the statute does condition the exercise of EPA's authority on its formation of a `judgment,' . . . that judgment must relate to whether an air pollutant `cause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> True but irrelevant. When the Administrator <i>makes</i> a judgment whether to regulate greenhouse gases, that judgment must relate to whether they are air pollutants that \"cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1). But the statute says <i>nothing at all</i> about the reasons for which the Administrator may <i>defer</i> making a judgment\u0097the permissible reasons for deciding not to grapple with the issue at the present time. Thus, the various \"policy\" rationales, <i>ante,</i> at 1463, that the Court criticizes are not \"divorced from the statutory text,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1462, except in the sense that the statutory text is silent, as texts are often silent about permissible reasons for the exercise of agency discretion. The reasons the EPA gave are surely considerations executive agencies <i>regularly</i> take into account (and <i>ought</i> to take into account) when deciding whether to consider entering a new field: the impact such entry would have on other Executive Branch programs and on foreign policy. There is no basis in law for the Court's imposed limitation.</p>\n<p>EPA's interpretation of the discretion conferred by the statutory reference to \"its judgment\" is not only reasonable, it is the most natural reading of the text. The Court nowhere explains why this interpretation is incorrect, let alone why it is not entitled to deference under <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1474</span> <i>Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). As the Administrator acted within the law in declining to make a \"judgment\" for the policy reasons above set forth, I would uphold the decision to deny the rulemaking petition on that ground alone.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Even on the Court's own terms, however, the same conclusion follows. As mentioned above, the Court gives EPA the option of determining that the science is too uncertain to allow it to form a \"judgment\" as to whether greenhouse gases endanger public welfare. Attached to this option (on what basis is unclear) is an essay requirement: \"If,\" the Court says, \"the scientific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment as to whether greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, EPA must say so.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1463. But EPA <i>has</i> said precisely that\u0097and at great length, based on information contained in a 2001 report by the National Research Council (NRC) entitled Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\"As the NRC noted in its report, concentrations of [greenhouse gases (GHGs)] are increasing in the atmosphere as a result of human activities (pp. 9-12). It also noted that `[a] diverse array of evidence points to a warming of global surface air temperatures' (p. 16). The report goes on to state, however, that `[b]ecause of the large and still uncertain level of natural variability inherent in the climate record and the uncertainties in the time histories of the various forcing agents (and particularly aerosols), a [causal] linkage between the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the observed climate changes during the 20th century cannot be unequivocally established. The fact that the magnitude of the observed warming is large in comparison to natural variability as simulated in climate models is suggestive of such a linkage, but it does not constitute proof of one because the model simulations could be deficient in natural variability on the decadal to century time scale' (p. 17).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The NRC also observed that `there is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how the climate system varies naturally and reacts to emissions of [GHGs] and aerosols' (p. 1). As a result of that uncertainty, the NRC cautioned that `current estimate of the magnitude of future warming should be regarded as tentative and subject to future adjustments (either upward or downward).' <i>Id.</i> It further advised that `[r]educing the wide range of uncertainty inherent in current model predictions of global climate change will require major advances in understanding and modeling of both (1) the factors that determine atmospheric concentrations of [GHGs] and aerosols and (2) the so-called \"feedbacks\" that determine the sensitivity of the climate system to a prescribed increase in [GHGs].' <i>Id.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The science of climate change is extraordinarily complex and still evolving. Although there have been substantial advances in climate change science, there continue to be important uncertainties in our understanding of the factors that may affect future climate change and how it should be addressed. As the NRC explained, predicting future climate change necessarily involves a complex web of economic and physical factors including: Our ability to predict future global anthropogenic emissions of GHGs and aerosols; the fate of these emissions once they enter the atmosphere (<i>e.g.,</i> what percentage are absorbed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1475</span> by vegetation or are taken up by the oceans); the impact of those emissions that remain in the atmosphere on the radiative properties of the atmosphere; changes in critically important climate feedbacks (<i>e.g.,</i> changes in cloud cover and ocean circulation); changes in temperature characteristics (<i>e.g.,</i> average temperatures, shifts in daytime and evening temperatures); changes in other climatic parameters (<i>e.g.,</i> shifts in precipitation, storms); and ultimately the impact of such changes on human health and welfare (<i>e.g.,</i> increases or decreases in agricultural productivity, human health impacts). The NRC noted, in particular, that `[t]he understanding of the relationships between weather/climate and human health is in its infancy and therefore the health consequences of climate change are poorly understood' (p. 20). Substantial scientific uncertainties limit our ability to assess each of these factors and to separate out those changes resulting from natural variability from those that are directly the result of increases in anthropogenic GHGs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Reducing the wide range of uncertainty inherent in current model predictions will require major advances in understanding and modeling of the factors that determine atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and the processes that determine the sensitivity of the climate system.\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52930.</blockquote>\n<p>I simply cannot conceive of what else the Court would like EPA to say.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Even before reaching its discussion of the word \"judgment,\" the Court makes another significant error when it concludes that \"\u00a7 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act <i>authorizes</i> EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a `judgment' that such emissions contribute to climate change.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1459 (emphasis added). For such authorization, the Court relies on what it calls \"the Clean Air Act's capacious definition of `air pollutant.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1460.</p>\n<p>\"Air pollutant\" is defined by the Act as \"any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical,. . . substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(g). The Court is correct that \"[c]arbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1462, fit within the second half of that definition: They are \"physical, chemical,. . . substance[s] or matter which [are] emitted into or otherwise ente[r] the ambient air.\" But the Court mistakenly believes this to be the end of the analysis. In order to be an \"air pollutant\" under the Act's definition, the \"substance or matter [being] emitted into . . . the ambient air\" must also meet the <i>first</i> half of the definition\u0097namely, it must be an \"air pollution agent or combination of such agents.\" The Court simply pretends this half of the definition does not exist.</p>\n<p>The Court's analysis faithfully follows the argument advanced by petitioners, which focuses on the word \"including\" in the statutory definition of \"air pollutant.\" See Brief for Petitioners 13-14. As that argument goes, anything that <i>follows</i> the word \"including\" must necessarily be a subset of whatever <i>precedes</i> it. Thus, if greenhouse gases qualify under the phrase following the word \"including,\" they must qualify under the phrase preceding it. Since greenhouse gases come within the capacious phrase \"any physical, chemical,. . . substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1476</span> they must also be \"air pollution agent[s] or combination[s] of such agents,\" and therefore meet the definition of \"air pollutant[s].\"</p>\n<p>That is certainly one possible interpretation of the statutory definition. The word \"including\" can indeed indicate that what follows will be an \"illustrative\" sampling of the general category that precedes the word. <i>Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co.,</i> 314 U.S. 95, 100, 62 S.Ct. 1, 86 L.Ed. 65 (1941). Often, however, the examples standing alone are broader than the general category, and must be viewed as limited in light of that category. The Government provides a helpful (and unanswered) example: \"The phrase `any American automobile, including any truck or minivan,' would not naturally be construed to encompass a foreign-manufactured [truck or] minivan.\" Brief for Federal Respondent 34. The general principle enunciated\u0097that the speaker is talking about <i>American</i> automobiles\u0097carries forward to the illustrative examples (trucks and minivans), and limits them accordingly, even though in isolation they are broader. Congress often uses the word \"including\" in this manner. In 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782(a), for example, it refers to \"a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal, including criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation.\" Certainly this provision would not encompass criminal investigations underway in a <i>domestic</i> tribunal. See also, <i>e.g.,</i> 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 54(a) (\"The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall, at the request of a Member of the House of Representatives, furnish to the Member, for official use only, one set of a privately published annotated version of the United States Code, including supplements and pocket parts\"); 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2304(b)(1) (\"the relevant findings of appropriate international organizations, including nongovernmental organizations\").</p>\n<p>In short, the word \"including\" does not require the Court's (or the petitioners') result. It is perfectly reasonable to view the definition of \"air pollutant\" in its entirety: An air pollutant <i>can</i> be \"any physical, chemical, . . . substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air,\" but only if it retains the general characteristic of being an \"air pollution agent or combination of such agents.\" This is precisely the conclusion EPA reached: \"[A] substance does not meet the CAA definition of `air pollutant' simply because it is a `physical, chemical,. . . substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.' It must also be an `air pollution agent.'\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52929, n. 3. See also <i>id.,</i> at 52928 (\"The root of the definition indicates that for a substance to be an `air pollutant,' it must be an `agent' of `air pollution'\"). Once again, in the face of textual ambiguity, the Court's application of <i>Chevron</i> deference to EPA's interpretation of the word \"including\" is nowhere to be found.<sup>[2]</sup> Evidently, the Court defers only to those reasonable interpretations that it favors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Using (as we ought to) EPA's interpretation of the definition of \"air pollutant,\" we must next determine whether greenhouse gases are \"agent[s]\" of \"air pollution.\" If so, the statute would authorize <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1477</span> regulation; if not, EPA would lack authority.</p>\n<p>Unlike \"air pollutants,\" the term \"air pollution\" is not itself defined by the CAA; thus, once again we must accept EPA's interpretation of that ambiguous term, provided its interpretation is a \"permissible construction of the statute.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S., at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. In this case, the petition for rulemaking asked EPA for \"regulation of [greenhouse gas] emissions from motor vehicles to reduce the risk of global climate change.\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52925. Thus, in deciding whether it had authority to regulate, EPA had to determine whether the concentration of greenhouse gases assertedly responsible for \"global climate change\" qualifies as \"air pollution.\" EPA began with the commonsense observation that the \"[p]roblems associated with atmospheric concentrations of CO2,\" <i>id.,</i> at 52927, bear little resemblance to what would naturally be termed \"air pollution\":</p>\n<blockquote>\"EPA's prior use of the CAA's general regulatory provisions provides an important context. Since the inception of the Act, EPA has used these provisions to address air pollution problems that occur primarily at ground level or near the surface of the earth. For example, national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) established under CAA section 109 address concentrations of substances in the ambient air and the related public health and welfare problems. This has meant setting NAAQS for concentrations of ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter and other substances in the air near the surface of the earth, not higher in the atmosphere. . . . CO2, by contrast, is fairly consistent in concentration throughout the world's atmosphere up to approximately the lower stratosphere.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 52926-52927.</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, regulating the buildup of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, which is alleged to be causing global climate change, is not akin to regulating the concentration of some substance that is <i>polluting</i> the <i>air.</i></p>\n<p>We need look no further than the dictionary for confirmation that this interpretation of \"air pollution\" is eminently reasonable. The definition of \"pollute,\" of course, is \"[t]o make or render impure or unclean.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 1910 (2d ed.1949). And the first three definitions of \"air\" are as follows: (1) \"[t]he invisible, odorless, and tasteless mixture of gases which surrounds the earth\"; (2) \"[t]he body of the earth's atmosphere; esp., the part of it near the earth, as distinguished from the upper rarefied part\"; (3) \"[a] portion of air or of the air considered with respect to physical characteristics or as affecting the senses.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 54. EPA's conception of \"air pollution\"\u0097focusing on impurities in the \"ambient air\" \"at ground level or near the surface of the earth\"\u0097is perfectly consistent with the natural meaning of that term.</p>\n<p>In the end, EPA concluded that since \"CAA authorization to regulate is generally based on a finding that an air pollutant causes or contributes to air pollution,\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52928, the concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases allegedly affecting the global climate are beyond the scope of CAA's authorization to regulate. \"[T]he term `air pollution' as used in the regulatory provisions cannot be interpreted to encompass global climate change.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Once again, the Court utterly fails to explain why this interpretation is incorrect, let alone so unreasonable as to be unworthy of <i>Chevron</i> deference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Court's alarm over global warming may or may not be justified, but it ought <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1478</span> not distort the outcome of this litigation. This is a straightforward administrative-law case, in which Congress has passed a malleable statute giving broad discretion, not to us but to an executive agency. No matter how important the underlying policy issues at stake, this Court has no business substituting its own desired outcome for the reasoned judgment of the responsible agency.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Pet. for Cert. 22.</p>\n<p>[2]  California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.</p>\n<p>[3]  District of Columbia, American Samoa, New York City, and Baltimore.</p>\n<p>[4]  Center for Biological Diversity, Center for Food Safety, Conservation Law Foundation, Environmental Advocates, Environmental Defense, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, International Center for Technology Assessment, National Environmental Trust, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, and U.S. Public Interest Research Group.</p>\n<p>[5]  Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah.</p>\n<p>[6]  Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, National Automobile Dealers Association, Engine Manufacturers Association, Truck Manufacturers Association, CO2 Litigation Group, and Utility Air Regulatory Group.</p>\n<p>[7]  The 1970 version of \u00a7 202(a)(1) used the phrase \"which endangers the public health or welfare\" rather than the more-protective \"which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" See \u00a7 6(a) of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1690.

He therefore asserts that the Commonwealth's injury is \"conjectur[al].\" See <i>ibid.</i> Yet the likelihood that Massachusetts' coastline will recede has nothing to do with whether petitioners have determined the precise metes and bounds of their soon-to-be-flooded land. Petitioners maintain that the seas are rising and will continue to rise, and have alleged that such a rise will lead to the loss of Massachusetts' sovereign territory. No one, save perhaps the dissenters, disputes those allegations.

Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP),</i> 412 U.S. 669, 687-688, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973). He does not, however, disavow this portion of Justice Stewart's opinion for the Court:\n</p>\n<p>\"Unlike the specific and geographically limited federal action of which the petitioner complained in <i>Sierra Club</i> [v. <i>Morton,</i> 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972)], the challenged agency action in this case is applicable to substantially all of the Nation's railroads, and thus allegedly has an adverse environmental impact on all the natural resources of the country. Rather than a limited group of persons who used a picturesque valley in California, all persons who utilize the scenic resources of the country, and indeed all who breathe its air, could claim harm similar to that alleged by the environmental groups here. But we have already made it clear that standing is not to be denied simply because many people suffer the same injury. Indeed some of the cases on which we relied in <i>Sierra Club</i> demonstrated the patent fact that persons across the Nation could be adversely affected by major governmental actions. <i>To deny standing to persons who are in fact injured simply because many others are also injured, would mean that the most injurious and widespread Government actions could be questioned by nobody.</i> We cannot accept that conclusion.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citations omitted and emphasis added).</p>\n<p>It is moreover quite wrong to analogize the legal claim advanced by Massachusetts and the other public and private entities who challenge EPA's parsimonious construction of the Clean Air Act to a mere \"lawyer's game.\" See <i>post,</i> at 1471.</p>\n<p>[25]  See <i>Department of Housing and Urban Development v. Rucker,</i> 535 U.S. 125, 131, 122 S.Ct. 1230, 152 L.Ed.2d 258 (2002) (observing that \"`any' ... has an expansive meaning, that is, one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind\" (some internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>[26]  In dissent, Justice SCALIA maintains that because greenhouse gases permeate the world's atmosphere rather than a limited area near the earth's surface, EPA's exclusion of greenhouse gases from the category of air pollution \"agent[s]\" is entitled to deference under <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i> 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). See <i>post,</i> at 1469-1470. EPA's distinction, however, finds no support in the text of the statute, which uses the phrase \"the ambient air\" without distinguishing between atmospheric layers. Moreover, it is a plainly unreasonable reading of a sweeping statutory provision designed to capture \"<i>any</i> physical, chemical ... substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(g). Justice SCALIA does not (and cannot) explain why Congress would define \"air pollutant\" so carefully and so broadly, yet confer on EPA the authority to narrow that definition whenever expedient by asserting that a particular substance is not an \"agent.\" At any rate, no party to this dispute contests that greenhouse gases both \"ente[r] the ambient air\" and tend to warm the atmosphere. They are therefore unquestionably \"agent[s]\" of air pollution.</p>\n<p>[27]  See <i>United States v. Price,</i> 361 U.S. 304, 313, 80 S.Ct. 326, 4 L.Ed.2d 334 (1960) (holding that \"the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one\"); see also <i>Cobell v. Norton,</i> 428 F.3d 1070, 1075 (C.A.D.C.2005) (\"[P]ost-enactment legislative history is not only oxymoronic but inherently entitled to little weight\").</p>\n<p>[28]  See, <i>e.g.,</i> National Climate Program Act, \u00a7 5, 92 Stat. 601, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2901 <i>et seq.</i> (calling for the establishment of a National Climate Program and for additional climate change research); Global Climate Protection Act of 1987, \u00a7 1103, 101 Stat. 1408-1409 (directing EPA and the Secretary of State to \"jointly\" develop a \"coordinated national policy on global climate change\" and report to Congress); Global Change Research Act of 1990, Tit.

The point is that nothing in our cases (or Hart &amp; Wechsler) suggests that the prudential requirements for <i>parens patriae</i> standing, see <i>Republic of Venezuela v. Philip Morris Inc.,</i> 287 F.3d 192, 199, n. (CADC 2002) (observing that \"<i>parens patriae</i> is merely a species of prudential standing\" (internal quotation marks omitted)), can somehow substitute for, or alter the content of, the \"irreducible constitutional minimum\" requirements of injury in fact, causation, and redressability under Article III. <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).\n</p>\n<p><i>Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co.,</i> 324 U.S. 439, 65 S.Ct. 716, 89 L.Ed. 1051 (1945), is not to the contrary. As the caption makes clear enough, the fact that a State may assert rights under a federal statute as <i>parens patriae</i> in no way refutes our clear ruling that \"[a] State does not have standing as <i>parens patriae</i> to bring an action against the Federal Government.\" <i>Alfred L. Snapp &amp; Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez,</i> 458 U.S. 592, 610, n. 16, 102 S.Ct. 3260, 73 L.Ed.2d 995 (1982).</p>\n<p>[2]  The difficulty with <i>SCRAP,</i> and the reason it has not been followed, is not the portion cited by the Court. See <i>ante,</i> at 1458-1459, n. 24. Rather, it is the <i>attenuated</i> nature of the injury there, and here, that is so troubling. Even in <i>SCRAP,</i> the Court noted that what was required was \"something more than an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable,\" 412 U.S., at 688, 93 S.Ct. 2405, and we have since understood the allegation there to have been \"that the string of occurrences alleged would happen <i>immediately,</i>\" <i>Whitmore v. Arkansas,</i> 495 U.S. 149, 159, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990) (emphasis added). That is hardly the case here.\n</p>\n<p>The Court says it is \"quite wrong\" to compare petitioners' challenging \"EPA's parsimonious construction of the Clean Air Act to a mere `lawyer's game.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1458-1459, n. 24. Of course it is not the legal challenge that is merely \"an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable,\" <i>SCRAP, supra,</i> at 688, 93 S.Ct. 2405, but the assertions made in support of standing.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Court's way of putting it is, of course, not quite accurate. The issue is whether it would be better <i>to defer the decision about whether to exercise judgment.</i> This has the <i>effect</i> of deferring regulation but is quite a different determination.</p>\n<p>[2]  Not only is EPA's interpretation reasonable, it is far more plausible than the Court's alternative. As the Court correctly points out, \"all airborne compounds of whatever stripe,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1460, would qualify as \"physical, chemical, . . . substance[s] or matter which [are] emitted into or otherwise ente[r] the ambient air,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(g). It follows that <i>everything</i> airborne, from Frisbees to flatulence, qualifies as an \"air pollutant.\" This reading of the statute defies common sense.</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued November 29, 2006\u2014Decided April 2, 2007\nBased on respected scientific opinion that a well-documented rise in\n  global temperatures and attendant climatological and environmental\n  changes have resulted from a significant increase in the atmospheric\n  concentration of \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d a group of private organizations\n  petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to begin regu\n  lating the emissions of four such gases, including carbon dioxide, un\n  der \u00a7202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, which requires that the EPA\n  \u201cshall by regulation prescribe . . . standards applicable to the emis\n  sion of any air pollutant from any class . . . of new motor vehicles . . .\n  which in [the EPA Administrator\u2019s] judgment cause[s], or contrib\n  ute[s] to, air pollution . . . reasonably . . . anticipated to endanger\n  public health or welfare,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a77521(a)(1). The Act defines\n  \u201cair pollutant\u201d to include \u201cany air pollution agent . . . , including any\n  physical, chemical . . . substance . . . emitted into . . . the ambient\n  air.\u201d \u00a77602(g). EPA ultimately denied the petition, reasoning that\n  (1) the Act does not authorize it to issue mandatory regulations to\n  address global climate change, and (2) even if it had the authority to\n  set greenhouse gas emission standards, it would have been unwise to\n  do so at that time because a causal link between greenhouse gases\n  and the increase in global surface air temperatures was not un\n  equivocally established. The agency further characterized any EPA\n  regulation of motor-vehicle emissions as a piecemeal approach to cli\n  mate change that would conflict with the President\u2019s comprehensive\n  approach involving additional support for technological innovation,\n  the creation of nonregulatory programs to encourage voluntary pri\n  vate-sector reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and further re\n  search on climate change, and might hamper the President\u2019s ability\n2                       MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    to persuade key developing nations to reduce emissions.\n       Petitioners, now joined by intervenor Massachusetts and other\n    state and local governments, sought review in the D. C. Circuit. Al\n    though each of the three judges on the panel wrote separately, two of\n    them agreed that the EPA Administrator properly exercised his dis\n    cretion in denying the rulemaking petition. One judge concluded that\n    the Administrator\u2019s exercise of \u201cjudgment\u201d as to whether a pollutant\n    could \u201creasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or wel\n    fare,\u201d \u00a77521(a)(1), could be based on scientific uncertainty as well as\n    other factors, including the concern that unilateral U. S. regulation of\n    motor-vehicle emissions could weaken efforts to reduce other coun\n    tries\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions. The second judge opined that peti\n    tioners had failed to demonstrate the particularized injury to them\n    that is necessary to establish standing under Article III, but accepted\n    the contrary view as the law of the case and joined the judgment on\n    the merits as the closest to that which he preferred. The court there\n    fore denied review.\nHeld:\n    1. Petitioners have standing to challenge the EPA\u2019s denial of their\n rulemaking petition. Pp. 12\u201323.\n       (a) This case suffers from none of the defects that would preclude\n it from being a justiciable Article III \u201cControvers[y].\u201d See, e.g., Lu\n ther v. Borden, 7 How. 1. Moreover, the proper construction of a con\n gressional statute is an eminently suitable question for federal-court\n resolution, and Congress has authorized precisely this type of chal\n lenge to EPA action, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a77607(b)(1). Contrary to EPA\u2019s\n argument, standing doctrine presents no insuperable jurisdictional\n obstacle here. To demonstrate standing, a litigant must show that it\n has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual\n or imminent, that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant, and\n that a favorable decision will likely redress that injury. See Lujan v.\n Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560\u2013561. However, a litigant to\n whom Congress has \u201caccorded a procedural right to protect his con\n crete interests,\u201d id., at 573, n. 7\u2014here, the right to challenge agency\n action unlawfully withheld, \u00a77607(b)(1)\u2014\u201ccan assert that right with\n out meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immedi\n acy,\u201d ibid. Only one petitioner needs to have standing to authorize\n review. See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional\n Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 52, n. 2. Massachusetts has a special posi\n tion and interest here. It is a sovereign State and not, as in Lujan, a\n private individual, and it actually owns a great deal of the territory\n alleged to be affected. The sovereign prerogatives to force reductions\n in greenhouse gas emissions, to negotiate emissions treaties with de\n veloping countries, and (in some circumstances) to exercise the police\n                   Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\npower to reduce motor-vehicle emissions are now lodged in the Fed\neral Government. Because congress has ordered EPA to protect Mas\nsachusetts (among others) by prescribing applicable standards,\n\u00a77521(a)(1), and has given Massachusetts a concomitant procedural\nright to challenge the rejection of its rulemaking petition as arbitrary\nand capricious, \u00a77607(b)(1), petitioners\u2019 submissions as they pertain\nto Massachusetts have satisfied the most demanding standards of the\nadversarial process. EPA\u2019s steadfast refusal to regulate greenhouse\ngas emissions presents a risk of harm to Massachusetts that is both\n\u201cactual\u201d and \u201cimminent,\u201d Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560, and there is a\n\u201csubstantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested\u201d will prompt\nEPA to take steps to reduce that risk, Duke Power Co. v. Carolina\nEnvironmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 79. Pp. 12\u201317.\n     (b) The harms associated with climate change are serious and\nwell recognized. The Government\u2019s own objective assessment of the\nrelevant science and a strong consensus among qualified experts in\ndicate that global warming threatens, inter alia, a precipitate rise in\nsea levels, severe and irreversible changes to natural ecosystems, a\nsignificant reduction in winter snowpack with direct and important\neconomic consequences, and increases in the spread of disease and\nthe ferocity of weather events. That these changes are widely shared\ndoes not minimize Massachusetts\u2019 interest in the outcome of this liti\ngation. See Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Akins, 524 U. S. 11, 24. Ac\ncording to petitioners\u2019 uncontested affidavits, global sea levels rose\nbetween 10 and 20 centimeters over the 20th century as a result of\nglobal warming and have already begun to swallow Massachusetts\u2019\ncoastal land. Remediation costs alone, moreover, could reach hun\ndreds of millions of dollars. Pp. 17\u201319.\n     (c) Given EPA\u2019s failure to dispute the existence of a causal con\nnection between man-made greenhouse gas emissions and global\nwarming, its refusal to regulate such emissions, at a minimum, \u201ccon\ntributes\u201d to Massachusetts\u2019 injuries. EPA overstates its case in argu\ning that its decision not to regulate contributes so insignificantly to\npetitioners\u2019 injuries that it cannot be haled into federal court, and\nthat there is no realistic possibility that the relief sought would miti\ngate global climate change and remedy petitioners\u2019 injuries, espe\ncially since predicted increases in emissions from China, India, and\nother developing nations will likely offset any marginal domestic de\ncrease EPA regulation could bring about. Agencies, like legislatures,\ndo not generally resolve massive problems in one fell swoop, see Wil\nliamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 489, but instead\nwhittle away over time, refining their approach as circumstances\nchange and they develop a more nuanced understanding of how best\nto proceed, cf. SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U. S. 194, 202\u2013203. That a\n4                        MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    first step might be tentative does not by itself negate federal-court ju\n    risdiction. And reducing domestic automobile emissions is hardly\n    tentative. Leaving aside the other greenhouse gases, the record indi\n    cates that the U. S. transportation sector emits an enormous quantity\n    of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Pp. 20\u201321.\n          (d) While regulating motor-vehicle emissions may not by itself\n    reverse global warming, it does not follow that the Court lacks juris\n    diction to decide whether EPA has a duty to take steps to slow or re\n    duce it. See Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 243, n. 15. Because of\n    the enormous potential consequences, the fact that a remedy\u2019s effec\n    tiveness might be delayed during the (relatively short) time it takes\n    for a new motor-vehicle fleet to replace an older one is essentially ir\n    relevant. Nor is it dispositive that developing countries are poised to\n    substantially increase greenhouse gas emissions: A reduction in do\n    mestic emissions would slow the pace of global emissions increases,\n    no matter what happens elsewhere. The Court attaches considerable\n    significance to EPA\u2019s espoused belief that global climate change must\n    be addressed. Pp. 21\u201323.\n       2. The scope of the Court\u2019s review of the merits of the statutory is\n    sues is narrow. Although an agency\u2019s refusal to initiate enforcement\n    proceedings is not ordinarily subject to judicial review, Heckler v.\n    Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, there are key differences between nonen\n    forcement and denials of rulemaking petitions that are, as in the pre\n    sent circumstances, expressly authorized. EPA concluded alterna\n    tively in its petition denial that it lacked authority under \u00a77521(a)(1)\n    to regulate new vehicle emissions because carbon dioxide is not an\n    \u201cair pollutant\u201d under \u00a77602, and that, even if it possessed authority,\n    it would decline to exercise it because regulation would conflict with\n    other administration priorities. Because the Act expressly permits\n    review of such an action, \u00a77607(b)(1), this Court \u201cmay reverse [it if it\n    finds it to be] arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other\n    wise not in accordance with law,\u201d \u00a77607(d)(9). Pp. 24\u201325.\n       3. Because greenhouse gases fit well within the Act\u2019s capacious\n    definition of \u201cair pollutant,\u201d EPA has statutory authority to regulate\n    emission of such gases from new motor vehicles. That definition\u2014\n    which includes \u201cany air pollution agent . . . , including any physical,\n    chemical, . . . substance . . . emitted into . . . the ambient air . . . ,\u201d\n    \u00a77602(g) (emphasis added)\u2014embraces all airborne compounds of\n    whatever stripe. Moreover, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse\n    gases are undoubtedly \u201cphysical [and] chemical . . . substance[s].\u201d\n    Ibid. EPA\u2019s reliance on postenactment congressional actions and de\n    liberations it views as tantamount to a command to refrain from\n    regulating greenhouse gas emissions is unavailing. Even if pos\n    tenactment legislative history could shed light on the meaning of an\n                   Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                     5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\notherwise-unambiguous statute, EPA identifies nothing suggesting\nthat Congress meant to curtail EPA\u2019s power to treat greenhouse\ngases as air pollutants. The Court has no difficulty reconciling Con\ngress\u2019 various efforts to promote interagency collaboration and re\nsearch to better understand climate change with the agency\u2019s pre\nexisting mandate to regulate \u201cany air pollutant\u201d that may endanger\nthe public welfare. FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529\nU. S. 120, 133, distinguished. Also unpersuasive is EPA\u2019s argument\nthat its regulation of motor-vehicle carbon dioxide emissions would\nrequire it to tighten mileage standards, a job (according to EPA) that\nCongress has assigned to the Department of Transportation. The\nfact that DOT\u2019s mandate to promote energy efficiency by setting\nmileage standards may overlap with EPA\u2019s environmental responsi\nbilities in no way licenses EPA to shirk its duty to protect the public\n\u201chealth\u201d and \u201cwelfare,\u201d \u00a77521(a)(1).

EPA\u2019s alternative basis for its decision\u2014that even if it has statu\ntory authority to regulate greenhouse gases, it would be unwise to do\nso at this time\u2014rests on reasoning divorced from the statutory text.\nWhile the statute conditions EPA action on its formation of a \u201cjudg\nment,\u201d that judgment must relate to whether an air pollutant\n\u201ccause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be\nanticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d \u00a77601(a)(1). Under\nthe Act\u2019s clear terms, EPA can avoid promulgating regulations only if\nit determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate\nchange or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it\ncannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they\ndo. It has refused to do so, offering instead a laundry list of reasons\nnot to regulate, including the existence of voluntary Executive\nBranch programs providing a response to global warming and im\npairment of the President\u2019s ability to negotiate with developing na\ntions to reduce emissions. These policy judgments have nothing to do\nwith whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change\nand do not amount to a reasoned justification for declining to form a\nscientific judgment. Nor can EPA avoid its statutory obligation by\nnoting the uncertainty surrounding various features of climate\nchange and concluding that it would therefore be better not to regu\nlate at this time. If the scientific uncertainty is so profound that it\nprecludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment, it must say so.\nThe statutory question is whether sufficient information exists for it\nto make an endangerment finding. Instead, EPA rejected the rule-\nmaking petition based on impermissible considerations. Its action\nwas therefore \u201carbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance\nwith law,\u201d \u00a77607(d)(9). On remand, EPA must ground its reasons for\naction or inaction in the statute.

Respected scientists\nbelieve the two trends are related. For when carbon diox\nide is released into the atmosphere, it acts like the ceiling\nof a greenhouse, trapping solar energy and retarding the\nescape of reflected heat. It is therefore a species\u2014the\nmost important species\u2014of a \u201cgreenhouse gas.\u201d\n  Calling global warming \u201cthe most pressing environ\nmental challenge of our time,\u201d1 a group of States,2 local\ngovernments,3 and private organizations,4 alleged in a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Pet.  for Cert. 22.\n  2 California,   Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey,\nNew Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.\n   3 District of Columbia, American Samoa, New York City, and Baltimore.\n   4 Center for Biological Diversity, Center for Food Safety, Conserva\n\ntion Law Foundation, Environmental Advocates, Environmental\nDefense, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, International Center for\nTechnology Assessment, National Environmental Trust, Natural\nResources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists,\nand U.

Specifically, petitioners\nasked us to answer two questions concerning the meaning\nof \u00a7202(a)(1) of the Act: whether EPA has the statutory\nauthority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new\nmotor vehicles; and if so, whether its stated reasons for\nrefusing to do so are consistent with the statute.\n   In response, EPA, supported by 10 intervening States5\nand six trade associations,6 correctly argued that we may\nnot address those two questions unless at least one peti\ntioner has standing to invoke our jurisdiction under Arti\ncle III of the Constitution. Notwithstanding the serious\ncharacter of that jurisdictional argument and the absence\nof any conflicting decisions construing \u00a7202(a)(1), the\nunusual importance of the underlying issue persuaded us\nto grant the writ. 548 U.

EPA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndrafted \u00a7202(a)(1) in 1970, carbon dioxide levels had\nreached 325 parts per million.10\n   In the late 1970\u2019s, the Federal Government began devot\ning serious attention to the possibility that carbon dioxide\nemissions associated with human activity could provoke\nclimate change. In 1978, Congress enacted the National\nClimate Program Act, 92 Stat. 601, which required the\nPresident to establish a program to \u201cassist the Nation and\nthe world to understand and respond to natural and man-\ninduced climate processes and their implications,\u201d id., \u00a73.\nPresident Carter, in turn, asked the National Research\nCouncil, the working arm of the National Academy of\nSciences, to investigate the subject. The Council\u2019s re\nsponse was unequivocal: \u201cIf carbon dioxide continues to\nincrease, the study group finds no reason to doubt that\nclimate changes will result and no reason to believe that\nthese changes will be negligible. . . . A wait-and-see policy\nmay mean waiting until it is too late.\u201d11\n   Congress next addressed the issue in 1987, when it\nenacted the Global Climate Protection Act, Title XI of Pub.\nL. 100\u2013204, 101 Stat. 1407, note following 15 U.

In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change (IPCC), a multinational scientific body\norganized under the auspices of the United Nations, pub\nlished its first comprehensive report on the topic. Draw\ning on expert opinions from across the globe, the IPCC\nconcluded that \u201cemissions resulting from human activities\nare substantially increasing the atmospheric concentra\ntions of . . . greenhouse gases [which] will enhance the\ngreenhouse effect, resulting on average in an additional\nwarming of the Earth\u2019s surface.\u201d12\n   Responding to the IPCC report, the United Nations\nconvened the \u201cEarth Summit\u201d in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe first President Bush attended and signed the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC), a nonbinding agreement among 154 nations to\nreduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and\nother greenhouse gases for the purpose of \u201cprevent[ing]\ndangerous anthropogenic [i.e., human-induced] interfer\nence with the [Earth\u2019s] climate system.\u201d13 S.

Because those targets did not\napply to developing and heavily polluting nations such as\nChina and India, the Senate unanimously passed a resolu\ntion expressing its sense that the United States should not\nenter into the Kyoto Protocol.

As to\nEPA\u2019s statutory authority, the petition observed that the\nagency itself had already confirmed that it had the power\nto regulate carbon dioxide. See id., at 18, n. 21. In 1998,\nJonathan Z. Cannon, then EPA\u2019s General Counsel, pre\npared a legal opinion concluding that \u201cCO2 emissions are\nwithin the scope of EPA\u2019s authority to regulate,\u201d even as\nhe recognized that EPA had so far declined to exercise\nthat authority. Id., at 54 (memorandum to Carol M.\nBrowner, Administrator (Apr. 10, 1998) (hereinafter Can\nnon memorandum)). Cannon\u2019s successor, Gary S. Guzy,\nreiterated that opinion before a congressional committee\njust two weeks before the rulemaking petition was filed.\nSee id., at 61.\n   Fifteen months after the petition\u2019s submission, EPA\nrequested public comment on \u201call the issues raised in [the]\npetition,\u201d adding a \u201cparticular\u201d request for comments on\n\u201cany scientific, technical, legal, economic or other aspect of\nthese issues that may be relevant to EPA\u2019s consideration\nof this petition.\u201d 66 Fed.

Temperatures are,\nin fact, rising.\u201d NRC Report 1.\n  On September 8, 2003, EPA entered an order denying the\nrulemaking petition. 68 Fed. Reg. 52922. The agency gave\ntwo reasons for its decision: (1) that contrary to the opin\nions of its former general counsels, the Clean Air Act does\nnot authorize EPA to issue mandatory regulations to\naddress global climate change, see id., at 52925\u201352929;\nand (2) that even if the agency had the authority to set\ngreenhouse gas emission standards, it would be unwise to\ndo so at this time, id., at 52929\u201352931.\n  In concluding that it lacked statutory authority over\ngreenhouse gases, EPA observed that Congress \u201cwas well\naware of the global climate change issue when it last\ncomprehensively amended the [Clean Air Act] in 1990,\u201d\nyet it declined to adopt a proposed amendment establish\ning binding emissions limitations. Id., at 52926. Congress\ninstead chose to authorize further investigation into cli\nmate change. Ibid.

Reg. 52927 (emphasis\nadded); declined in 1990 to enact proposed amendments to\nforce EPA to set carbon dioxide emission standards for\nmotor vehicles, ibid. (citing H. R. 5966, 101st Cong., 2d\nSess. (1990)); and addressed global climate change in\nother legislation, 68 Fed. Reg. 52927. Because of this\npolitical history, and because imposing emission limita\ntions on greenhouse gases would have even greater eco\nnomic and political repercussions than regulating tobacco,\nEPA was persuaded that it lacked the power to do so. Id.,\nat 52928. In essence, EPA concluded that climate change\nwas so important that unless Congress spoke with exact\ning specificity, it could not have meant the agency to\naddress it.\n   Having reached that conclusion, EPA believed it fol\nlowed that greenhouse gases cannot be \u201cair pollutants\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the Act. See ibid. (\u201cIt follows from\nthis conclusion, that [greenhouse gases], as such, are not\nair pollutants under the [Clean Air Act\u2019s] regulatory pro\nvisions . . .\u201d). The agency bolstered this conclusion by\nexplaining that if carbon dioxide were an air pollutant, the\nonly feasible method of reducing tailpipe emissions would\nbe to improve fuel economy. But because Congress has\nalready created detailed mandatory fuel economy stan\ndards subject to Department of Transportation (DOT)\nadministration, the agency concluded that EPA regulation\nwould either conflict with those standards or be superflu\nous. Id., at 52929.\n   Even assuming that it had authority over greenhouse\ngases, EPA explained in detail why it would refuse to exer\n10                    MASSACHUSETTS v.

The agency began by recognizing that\nthe concentration of greenhouse gases has dramatically\nincreased as a result of human activities, and acknowledged\nthe attendant increase in global surface air temperatures.\nId., at 52930. EPA nevertheless gave controlling impor\ntance to the NRC Report\u2019s statement that a causal link\nbetween the two \u201c \u2018cannot be unequivocally established.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (quoting NRC Report 17). Given that residual uncer\ntainty, EPA concluded that regulating greenhouse gas\nemissions would be unwise. 68 Fed. Reg. 52930.\n   The agency furthermore characterized any EPA regula\ntion of motor-vehicle emissions as a \u201cpiecemeal approach\u201d to\nclimate change, id., at 52931, and stated that such regula\ntion would conflict with the President\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive\napproach\u201d to the problem, id., at 52932. That approach\ninvolves additional support for technological innovation, the\ncreation of nonregulatory programs to encourage voluntary\nprivate-sector reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and\nfurther research on climate change\u2014not actual regulation.\nId., at 52932\u201352933. According to EPA, unilateral EPA\nregulation of motor-vehicle greenhouse gas emissions might\nalso hamper the President\u2019s ability to persuade key devel\noping countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Id., at\n52931.\n                            III\n  Petitioners, now joined by intervenor States and local\ngovernments, sought review of EPA\u2019s order in the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Cir\ncuit.16 Although each of the three judges on the panel\nwrote a separate opinion, two judges agreed \u201cthat the EPA\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 See 42 U.

The court therefore denied the petition\nfor review.\n  In his opinion announcing the court\u2019s judgment, Judge\nRandolph avoided a definitive ruling as to petitioners\u2019\nstanding, id., at 56, reasoning that it was permissible to\nproceed to the merits because the standing and the merits\ninquiries \u201coverlap[ped],\u201d ibid. Assuming without deciding\nthat the statute authorized the EPA Administrator to\nregulate greenhouse gas emissions that \u201cin his judgment\u201d\nmay \u201creasonably be anticipated to endanger public health\nor welfare,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a77521(a)(1), Judge Randolph con\ncluded that the exercise of that judgment need not be\nbased solely on scientific evidence, but may also be in\nformed by the sort of policy judgments that motivate\ncongressional action. 415 F. 3d, at 58. Given that frame\nwork, it was reasonable for EPA to base its decision on\nscientific uncertainty as well as on other factors, including\nthe concern that unilateral regulation of U. S. motor-\nvehicle emissions could weaken efforts to reduce green\nhouse gas emissions from other countries. Ibid.\n  Judge Sentelle wrote separately because he believed\npetitioners failed to \u201cdemonstrat[e] the element of injury\nnecessary to establish standing under Article III.\u201d Id., at\n59 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring in judg\nment). In his view, they had alleged that global warming\nis \u201charmful to humanity at large,\u201d but could not allege\n\u201cparticularized injuries\u201d to themselves. Id., at 60 (citing\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 562 (1992)).\nWhile he dissented on standing, however, he accepted the\ncontrary view as the law of the case and joined Judge\nRandolph\u2019s judgment on the merits as the closest to that\nwhich he preferred. 415 F. 3d, at 60\u201361.\n  Judge Tatel dissented. Emphasizing that EPA nowhere\nchallenged the factual basis of petitioners\u2019 affidavits, id.,\n12                MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 66, he concluded that at least Massachusetts had \u201csatis\nfied each element of Article III standing\u2014injury, causa\ntion, and redressability,\u201d id., at 64. In Judge Tatel\u2019s view,\nthe \u201c \u2018substantial probability,\u2019 \u201d id., at 66, that projected\nrises in sea level would lead to serious loss of coastal\nproperty was a \u201cfar cry\u201d from the kind of generalized harm\ninsufficient to ground Article III jurisdiction. Id., at 65.\nHe found that petitioners\u2019 affidavits more than adequately\nsupported the conclusion that EPA\u2019s failure to curb green\nhouse gas emissions contributed to the sea level changes\nthat threatened Massachusetts\u2019 coastal property. Ibid. As\nto redressability, he observed that one of petitioners\u2019\nexperts, a former EPA climatologist, stated that\n\u201c \u2018[a]chievable reductions in emissions of CO2 and other\n[greenhouse gases] from U. S. motor vehicles would . . .\ndelay and moderate many of the adverse impacts of global\nwarming.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting declaration of Michael Mac-\nCracken, former Executive Director, U. S.

He further noted\nthat the one-time director of EPA\u2019s motor-vehicle pollution\ncontrol efforts stated in an affidavit that enforceable emis\nsion standards would lead to the development of new\ntechnologies that \u201c \u2018would gradually be mandated by other\ncountries around the world.\u2019 \u201d 415 F. 3d, at 66 (quoting\ndeclaration of Michael Walsh \u00b6\u00b67\u20138, 10, Stdg.

On the merits, Judge Tatel explained at length\nwhy he believed the text of the statute provided EPA with\nauthority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and why\nits policy concerns did not justify its refusal to exercise\nthat authority. 415 F. 3d, at 67\u201382.\n                             IV\n  Article III of the Constitution limits federal-court juris\ndiction to \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d Those two words\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 95 (1968). It is there\nfore familiar learning that no justiciable \u201ccontroversy\u201d\nexists when parties seek adjudication of a political ques\ntion, Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1 (1849), when they ask for\nan advisory opinion, Hayburn\u2019s Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792),\nsee also Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 700, n. 33 (1997),\nor when the question sought to be adjudicated has been\nmooted by subsequent developments, California v. San\nPablo & Tulare R. Co., 149 U. S. 308 (1893). This case\nsuffers from none of these defects.\n   The parties\u2019 dispute turns on the proper construction of a\ncongressional statute, a question eminently suitable to\nresolution in federal court. Congress has moreover author\nized this type of challenge to EPA action. See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a77607(b)(1). That authorization is of critical importance to\nthe standing inquiry: \u201cCongress has the power to define\ninjuries and articulate chains of causation that will give\nrise to a case or controversy where none existed before.\u201d\nLujan, 504 U. S., at 580 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment). \u201cIn exercising this power,\nhowever, Congress must at the very least identify the\ninjury it seeks to vindicate and relate the injury to the\nclass of persons entitled to bring suit.\u201d Ibid. We will not,\ntherefore, \u201centertain citizen suits to vindicate the public\u2019s\nnonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the\nlaws.\u201d Id., at 581.\n   EPA maintains that because greenhouse gas emissions\ninflict widespread harm, the doctrine of standing presents\nan insuperable jurisdictional obstacle. We do not agree.\nAt bottom, \u201cthe gist of the question of standing\u201d is whether\npetitioners have \u201csuch a personal stake in the outcome of\nthe controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness\nwhich sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the\n14                 MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt so largely depends for illumination.\u201d Baker v. Carr,\n369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962). As JUSTICE KENNEDY explained\nin his Lujan concurrence:\n     \u201cWhile it does not matter how many persons have\n     been injured by the challenged action, the party bring\n     ing suit must show that the action injures him in a\n     concrete and personal way. This requirement is not\n     just an empty formality. It preserves the vitality of\n     the adversarial process by assuring both that the par\n     ties before the court have an actual, as opposed to pro\n     fessed, stake in the outcome, and that the legal ques\n     tions presented . . . will be resolved, not in the rarified\n     atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete\n     factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of\n     the consequences of judicial action.\u201d 504 U. S., at 581\n     (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   To ensure the proper adversarial presentation, Lujan\nholds that a litigant must demonstrate that it has suffered\na concrete and particularized injury that is either actual\nor imminent, that the injury is fairly traceable to the\ndefendant, and that it is likely that a favorable decision\nwill redress that injury. See id., at 560\u2013561. However, a\nlitigant to whom Congress has \u201caccorded a procedural\nright to protect his concrete interests,\u201d id., at 572, n. 7\u2014\nhere, the right to challenge agency action unlawfully\nwithheld, \u00a77607(b)(1)\u2014\u201ccan assert that right without\nmeeting all the normal standards for redressability and\nimmediacy,\u201d ibid. When a litigant is vested with a proce\ndural right, that litigant has standing if there is some\npossibility that the requested relief will prompt the injury-\ncausing party to reconsider the decision that allegedly\nharmed the litigant. Ibid.; see also Sugar Cane Growers\nCooperative of Fla. v. Veneman, 289 F. 3d 89, 94\u201395\n(CADC 2002) (\u201cA [litigant] who alleges a deprivation of a\nprocedural protection to which he is entitled never has to\n                  Cite as: 549 U.

All that is necessary\nis to show that the procedural step was connected to the\nsubstantive result\u201d).\n   Only one of the petitioners needs to have standing to\npermit us to consider the petition for review. See Rumsfeld\nv. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547\nU. S. 47, 52, n. 2 (2006). We stress here, as did Judge Tatel\nbelow, the special position and interest of Massachusetts.\nIt is of considerable relevance that the party seeking re\nview here is a sovereign State and not, as it was in Lujan,\na private individual.\n   Well before the creation of the modern administrative\nstate, we recognized that States are not normal litigants\nfor the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction. As Jus\ntice Holmes explained in Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co.,\n206 U. S. 230, 237 (1907), a case in which Georgia sought\nto protect its citizens from air pollution originating outside\nits borders:\n       \u201cThe case has been argued largely as if it were one\n    between two private parties; but it is not. The very\n    elements that would be relied upon in a suit between\n    fellow-citizens as a ground for equitable relief are\n    wanting here. The State owns very little of the terri\n    tory alleged to be affected, and the damage to it capa\n    ble of estimate in money, possibly, at least, is small.\n    This is a suit by a State for an injury to it in its capac\n    ity of quasi-sovereign. In that capacity the State has\n    an interest independent of and behind the titles of its\n    citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain. It\n    has the last word as to whether its mountains shall be\n    stripped of their forests and its inhabitants shall\n    breathe pure air.\u201d\nJust as Georgia\u2019s \u201cindependent interest . . . in all the earth\nand air within its domain\u201d supported federal jurisdiction a\n16                MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncentury ago, so too does Massachusetts\u2019 well-founded\ndesire to preserve its sovereign territory today. Cf. Alden\nv. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 715 (1999) (observing that in the\nfederal system, the States \u201care not relegated to the role of\nmere provinces or political corporations, but retain the\ndignity, though not the full authority, of sovereignty\u201d).\nThat Massachusetts does in fact own a great deal of the\n\u201cterritory alleged to be affected\u201d only reinforces the con\nclusion that its stake in the outcome of this case is suffi\nciently concrete to warrant the exercise of federal judicial\npower.\n   When a State enters the Union, it surrenders certain\nsovereign prerogatives. Massachusetts cannot invade\nRhode Island to force reductions in greenhouse gas emis\nsions, it cannot negotiate an emissions treaty with China\nor India, and in some circumstances the exercise of its\npolice powers to reduce in-state motor-vehicle emissions\nmight well be pre-empted. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son,\nInc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U. S. 592, 607 (1982)\n(\u201cOne helpful indication in determining whether an al\nleged injury to the health and welfare of its citizens suf\nfices to give the State standing to sue parens patriae is\nwhether the injury is one that the State, if it could, would\nlikely attempt to address through its sovereign lawmaking\npowers\u201d).\n   These sovereign prerogatives are now lodged in the\nFederal Government, and Congress has ordered EPA to\nprotect Massachusetts (among others) by prescribing stan\ndards applicable to the \u201cemission of any air pollutant from\nany class or classes of new motor vehicle engines, which in\n[the Administrator\u2019s] judgment cause, or contribute to, air\npollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger\npublic health or welfare.\u201d 42 U.

Ten\n\nnessee Copper Co., 206 U. S. 230 (1907), see post, at 3\u20134 (dissenting\nopinion), and \u201cdevis[ing] a new doctrine of state standing,\u201d id., at 15.\nBut no less an authority than Hart & Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts\nand the Federal System understands Tennessee Copper as a standing\ndecision. R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart & Wechsler\u2019s The\nFederal Courts and the Federal System 290 (5th ed. 2003). Indeed, it\ndevotes an entire section to chronicling the long development of cases\npermitting States \u201cto litigate as parens patriae to protect quasi-\nsovereign interests\u2014i.e., public or governmental interests that concern\nthe state as a whole.\u201d Id., at 289; see, e.g., Missouri v. Illinois, 180\nU. S. 208, 240\u2013241 (1901) (finding federal jurisdiction appropriate not\nonly \u201cin cases involving boundaries and jurisdiction over lands and\ntheir inhabitants, and in cases directly affecting the property rights\nand interests of a state,\u201d but also when the \u201csubstantial impairment of\nthe health and prosperity of the towns and cities of the state\u201d are at\nstake).\n   Drawing on Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447 (1923), and Alfred\nL. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U. S. 592 (1982)\n(citing Missouri v. Illinois, 180 U. S. 208 (1901)), THE CHIEF JUSTICE\nclaims that we \u201coverloo[k] the fact that our cases cast significant doubt\non a State\u2019s standing to assert a quasi-sovereign interest . . . against\nthe Federal Government.\u201d Post, at 5. Not so. Mellon itself disavowed\nany such broad reading when it noted that the Court had been \u201ccalled\nupon to adjudicate, not rights of person or property, not rights of\ndominion over physical domain, [and] not quasi sovereign rights actu\nally invaded or threatened.\u201d 262 U. S., at 484\u2013485 (emphasis added).\nIn any event, we held in Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U. S. 439,\n447 (1945), that there is a critical difference between allowing a State\n\u201cto protect her citizens from the operation of federal statutes\u201d (which is\nwhat Mellon prohibits) and allowing a State to assert its rights under\nfederal law (which it has standing to do). Massachusetts does not here\ndispute that the Clean Air Act applies to its citizens; it rather seeks to\nassert its rights under the Act. See also Nebraska v. Wyoming, 515\nU. S. 1, 20 (1995) (holding that Wyoming had standing to bring a cross-\nclaim against the United States to vindicate its \u201c \u2018quasi-sovereign\u2019\ninterests which are \u2018independent of and behind the titles of its citizens,\nin all the earth and air within its domain\u2019 \u201d (quoting Tennessee Copper,\n206 U. S., at 237)).\n18                MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   With that in mind, it is clear that petitioners\u2019 submis\nsions as they pertain to Massachusetts have satisfied the\nmost demanding standards of the adversarial process.\nEPA\u2019s steadfast refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emis\nsions presents a risk of harm to Massachusetts that is\nboth \u201cactual\u201d and \u201cimminent.\u201d Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560\n(internal quotation marks omitted). There is, moreover, a\n\u201csubstantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested\u201d\nwill prompt EPA to take steps to reduce that risk. Duke\nPower Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc.,\n438 U. S. 59, 79 (1978).\nThe Injury\n  The harms associated with climate change are serious\nand well recognized. Indeed, the NRC Report itself\u2014\nwhich EPA regards as an \u201cobjective and independent\nassessment of the relevant science,\u201d 68 Fed. Reg. 52930\u2014\nidentifies a number of environmental changes that have\nalready inflicted significant harms, including \u201cthe global\nretreat of mountain glaciers, reduction in snow-cover\nextent, the earlier spring melting of rivers and lakes, [and]\nthe accelerated rate of rise of sea levels during the 20th\ncentury relative to the past few thousand years . . . .\u201d\nNRC Report 16.\n  Petitioners allege that this only hints at the environ\nmental damage yet to come. According to the climate\nscientist Michael MacCracken, \u201cqualified scientific experts\ninvolved in climate change research\u201d have reached a\n\u201cstrong consensus\u201d that global warming threatens (among\nother things) a precipitate rise in sea levels by the end of\nthe century, MacCracken Decl. \u00b615, Stdg.

See Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Akins,\n524 U. S. 11, 24 (1998) (\u201c[W]here a harm is concrete,\nthough widely shared, the Court has found \u2018injury in\nfact\u2019 \u201d). According to petitioners\u2019 unchallenged affidavits,\nglobal sea levels rose somewhere between 10 and 20 cen\ntimeters over the 20th century as a result of global warm\ning. MacCracken Decl. \u00b65(c), Stdg. App. 208. These rising\nseas have already begun to swallow Massachusetts\u2019\ncoastal land. Id., at 196 (declaration of Paul H. Kirshen\n\u00b65), 216 (MacCracken Decl. \u00b623). Because the Common\nwealth \u201cowns a substantial portion of the state\u2019s coastal\nproperty,\u201d id., at 171 (declaration of Karst R. Hoogeboom\n\u00b64),19 it has alleged a particularized injury in its capacity\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   18 In this regard, MacCracken\u2019s 2004 affidavit\u2014drafted more than a\n\nyear in advance of Hurricane Katrina\u2014was eerily prescient. Immedi\nately after discussing the \u201cparticular concern\u201d that climate change\nmight cause an \u201cincrease in the wind speed and peak rate of precipita\ntion of major tropical cyclones (i.e., hurricanes and typhoons),\u201d Mac-\nCracken noted that \u201c[s]oil compaction, sea level rise and recurrent\nstorms are destroying approximately 20\u201330 square miles of Louisiana\nwetlands each year. These wetlands serve as a \u2018shock absorber\u2019 for\nstorm surges that could inundate New Orleans, significantly enhancing\nthe risk to a major urban population.\u201d \u00b6\u00b624\u201325, Stdg. App. 217.\n   19 \u201cFor example, the [Massachusetts Department of Conservation and\n\nRecreation] owns, operates and maintains approximately 53 coastal\nstate parks, beaches, reservations, and wildlife sanctuaries. [It] also\nowns, operates and maintains sporting and recreational facilities in\ncoastal areas, including numerous pools, skating rinks, playgrounds,\nplaying fields, former coastal fortifications, public stages, museums,\nbike trails, tennis courts, boathouses and boat ramps and landings.\nAssociated with these coastal properties and facilities is a significant\namount of infrastructure, which the Commonwealth also owns, oper\nates and maintains, including roads, parkways, stormwater pump\nstations, pier[s], sea wal[l] revetments and dams.\u201d Hoogeboom Decl.\n\u00b64, at 171.\n20                    MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nas a landowner. The severity of that injury will only\nincrease over the course of the next century: If sea levels\ncontinue to rise as predicted, one Massachusetts official\nbelieves that a significant fraction of coastal property will\nbe \u201ceither permanently lost through inundation or temporar\nily lost through periodic storm surge and flooding events.\u201d\nId., \u00b66, at 172.20 Remediation costs alone, petitioners allege,\ncould run well into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Id.,\n\u00b67, at 172; see also Kirshen Decl. \u00b612, at 198.21\nCausation\n   EPA does not dispute the existence of a causal connec\ntion between man-made greenhouse gas emissions and\nglobal warming. At a minimum, therefore, EPA\u2019s refusal\nto regulate such emissions \u201ccontributes\u201d to Massachusetts\u2019\ninjuries.\n   EPA nevertheless maintains that its decision not to\nregulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehi\ncles contributes so insignificantly to petitioners\u2019 injuries\nthat the agency cannot be haled into federal court to an\nswer for them. For the same reason, EPA does not believe\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 See also id., at 179 (declaration of Christian Jacqz) (discussing\n\npossible loss of roughly 14 acres of land per miles of coastline by 2100);\nKirshen Decl. \u00b610, at 198 (alleging that \u201c[w]hen such a rise in sea level\noccurs, a 10-year flood will have the magnitude of the present 100-year\nflood and a 100-year flood will have the magnitude of the present 500\nyear flood\u201d).\n   21 In dissent, THE CHIEF JUSTICE dismisses petitioners\u2019 submissions as\n\n\u201cconclusory,\u201d presumably because they do not quantify Massachusetts\u2019\nland loss with the exactitude he would prefer. Post, at 8. He therefore\nasserts that the Commonwealth\u2019s injury is \u201cconjectur[al].\u201d See ibid.\nYet the likelihood that Massachusetts\u2019 coastline will recede has nothing\nto do with whether petitioners have determined the precise metes and\nbounds of their soon-to-be-flooded land. Petitioners maintain that the\nseas are rising and will continue to rise, and have alleged that such a\nrise will lead to the loss of Massachusetts\u2019 sovereign territory. No one,\nsave perhaps the dissenters, disputes those allegations. Our cases\nrequire nothing more.\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat any realistic possibility exists that the relief petition\ners seek would mitigate global climate change and remedy\ntheir injuries. That is especially so because predicted\nincreases in greenhouse gas emissions from developing\nnations, particularly China and India, are likely to offset\nany marginal domestic decrease.\n  But EPA overstates its case. Its argument rests on the\nerroneous assumption that a small incremental step,\nbecause it is incremental, can never be attacked in a fed\neral judicial forum. Yet accepting that premise would\ndoom most challenges to regulatory action. Agencies, like\nlegislatures, do not generally resolve massive problems in\none fell regulatory swoop. See Williamson v. Lee Optical\nof Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 489 (1955) (\u201c[A] reform may\ntake one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of\nthe problem which seems most acute to the legislative\nmind\u201d). They instead whittle away at them over time,\nrefining their preferred approach as circumstances change\nand as they develop a more-nuanced understanding of how\nbest to proceed. Cf. SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U. S. 194,\n202 (1947) (\u201cSome principles must await their own devel\nopment, while others must be adjusted to meet particular,\nunforeseeable situations\u201d). That a first step might be\ntentative does not by itself support the notion that federal\ncourts lack jurisdiction to determine whether that step\nconforms to law.\n  And reducing domestic automobile emissions is hardly a\ntentative step. Even leaving aside the other greenhouse\ngases, the United States transportation sector emits an\nenormous quantity of carbon dioxide into the atmos\nphere\u2014according to the MacCracken affidavit, more than\n1.7 billion metric tons in 1999 alone. \u00b630, Stdg. App. 219.\nThat accounts for more than 6% of worldwide carbon\ndioxide emissions. Id., at 232 (Oppenheimer Decl. \u00b63); see\nalso MacCracken Decl. \u00b631, at 220.

S. motor-vehicle\nemissions make a meaningful contribution to greenhouse\ngas concentrations and hence, according to petitioners, to\nglobal warming.\nThe Remedy\n   While it may be true that regulating motor-vehicle\nemissions will not by itself reverse global warming, it by no\nmeans follows that we lack jurisdiction to decide whether\nEPA has a duty to take steps to slow or reduce it. See also\nLarson v. Valente, 456 U.

He need not show that a favorable\ndecision will relieve his every injury\u201d). Because of the\nenormity of the potential consequences associated with\nman-made climate change, the fact that the effectiveness\nof a remedy might be delayed during the (relatively short)\ntime it takes for a new motor-vehicle fleet to replace an\nolder one is essentially irrelevant.23 Nor is it dispositive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  22 See  UNFCCC, National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data for the Period\n1990\u20132004 and Status of Reporting 14 (2006) (hereinafter Inventory Data)\n(reflecting emissions from Annex I countries); UNFCCC, Sixth Compilation\nand Synthesis of Initial National Communications from Parties not In\ncluded in Annex I to the Convention 7\u20138 (2005) (reflecting emissions from\nnon-Annex I countries); see also Dept. of Energy, Energy Information\nAdmin., International Energy Annual 2004, H.1co2 World Carbon Dioxide\nEmissions from the Consumption and Flaring of Fossil Fuels, 1980\u20132004\n(Table), http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/tableh1co2.xls.\n   23 See also Mountain States Legal Foundation v.

Students Challenging Regulatory\nAgency Procedures (SCRAP), 412 U. S. 669, 687\u2013688 (1973). He does\nnot, however, disavow this portion of Justice Stewart\u2019s opinion for the\nCourt:\n\u201cUnlike the specific and geographically limited federal action of which\nthe petitioner complained in Sierra Club [v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727\n(1972)], the challenged agency action in this case is applicable to\nsubstantially all of the Nation\u2019s railroads, and thus allegedly has an\nadverse environmental impact on all the natural resources of the\n24                    MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA \n\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\n                              V\n\n   The scope of our review of the merits of the statutory\nissues is narrow. As we have repeated time and again, an\nagency has broad discretion to choose how best to marshal\nits limited resources and personnel to carry out its dele\ngated responsibilities. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu\nral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842\u2013845\n(1984). That discretion is at its height when the agency\ndecides not to bring an enforcement action. Therefore, in\nHeckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821 (1985), we held that an\nagency\u2019s refusal to initiate enforcement proceedings is not\nordinarily subject to judicial review. Some debate re\nmains, however, as to the rigor with which we review an\nagency\u2019s denial of a petition for rulemaking.\n   There are key differences between a denial of a petition\nfor rulemaking and an agency\u2019s decision not to initiate an\nenforcement action. See American Horse Protection Assn.,\nInc. v. Lyng, 812 F. 2d 1, 3\u20134 (CADC 1987). In contrast to\nnonenforcement decisions, agency refusals to initiate\nrulemaking \u201care less frequent, more apt to involve legal as\nopposed to factual analysis, and subject to special formali\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncountry. Rather than a limited group of persons who used a pictur\nesque valley in California, all persons who utilize the scenic resources\nof the country, and indeed all who breathe its air, could claim harm\nsimilar to that alleged by the environmental groups here. But we have\nalready made it clear that standing is not to be denied simply because\nmany people suffer the same injury. Indeed some of the cases on which\nwe relied in Sierra Club demonstrated the patent fact that persons\nacross the Nation could be adversely affected by major governmental\nactions. To deny standing to persons who are in fact injured simply\nbecause many others are also injured, would mean that the most injuri\nous and widespread Government actions could be questioned by nobody.\nWe cannot accept that conclusion.\u201d Ibid. (citations omitted and empha\nsis added).\nIt is moreover quite wrong to analogize the legal claim advanced by\nMassachusetts and the other public and private entities who challenge\nEPA\u2019s parsimonious construction of the Clean Air Act to a mere \u201claw\nyer\u2019s game.\u201d See post, at 14.\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

They moreover arise out of denials of\npetitions for rulemaking which (at least in the circum\nstances here) the affected party had an undoubted proce\ndural right to file in the first instance. Refusals to prom\nulgate rules are thus susceptible to judicial review, though\nsuch review is \u201cextremely limited\u201d and \u201chighly deferen\ntial.\u201d National Customs Brokers & Forwarders Assn of\nAmerica, Inc. v. United States, 883 F. 2d 93, 96 (CADC\n1989).\n   EPA concluded in its denial of the petition for rulemak\ning that it lacked authority under 42 U. S. C. \u00a77521(a)(1)\nto regulate new vehicle emissions because carbon dioxide\nis not an \u201cair pollutant\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a77602.\nIn the alternative, it concluded that even if it possessed\nauthority, it would decline to do so because regulation\nwould conflict with other administration priorities. As\ndiscussed earlier, the Clean Air Act expressly permits\nreview of such an action. \u00a77607(b)(1). We therefore \u201cmay\nreverse any such action found to be . . . arbitrary, capri\ncious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accor\ndance with law.\u201d \u00a77607(d)(9).\n                              VI\n   On the merits, the first question is whether \u00a7202(a)(1) of\nthe Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse\ngas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it\nforms a \u201cjudgment\u201d that such emissions contribute to\nclimate change. We have little trouble concluding that it\ndoes. In relevant part, \u00a7202(a)(1) provides that EPA \u201cshall\nby regulation prescribe . . . standards applicable to the\nemission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of\nnew motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which in\n[the Administrator\u2019s] judgment cause, or contribute to, air\npollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endan\nger public health or welfare.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a77521(a)(1).\n26                    MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nBecause EPA believes that Congress did not intend it to\nregulate substances that contribute to climate change, the\nagency maintains that carbon dioxide is not an \u201cair pollut\nant\u201d within the meaning of the provision.\n  The statutory text forecloses EPA\u2019s reading. The Clean\nAir Act\u2019s sweeping definition of \u201cair pollutant\u201d includes\n\u201cany air pollution agent or combination of such agents,\nincluding any physical, chemical . . . substance or matter\nwhich is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient\nair . . . .\u201d \u00a77602(g) (emphasis added). On its face, the\ndefinition embraces all airborne compounds of whatever\nstripe, and underscores that intent through the repeated\nuse of the word \u201cany.\u201d25 Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous\noxide, and hydrofluorocarbons are without a doubt \u201cphysi\ncal [and] chemical . . . substance[s] which [are] emitted\ninto . . . the ambient air.\u201d The statute is unambiguous.26\n  Rather than relying on statutory text, EPA invokes\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  25 See Department of Housing and Urban Development v. Rucker, 535\n\nU.

S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. 467 U. S.\n837 (1984). See post, at 11\u201313. EPA\u2019s distinction, however, finds no\nsupport in the text of the statute, which uses the phrase \u201cthe ambient\nair\u201d without distinguishing between atmospheric layers. Moreover, it is\na plainly unreasonable reading of a sweeping statutory provision\ndesigned to capture \u201cany physical, chemical . . . substance or matter\nwhich is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a77602(g). JUSTICE SCALIA does not (and cannot) explain why Congress\nwould define \u201cair pollutant\u201d so carefully and so broadly, yet confer on\nEPA the authority to narrow that definition whenever expedient by\nasserting that a particular substance is not an \u201cagent.\u201d At any rate, no\nparty to this dispute contests that greenhouse gases both \u201cente[r] the\nambient air\u201d and tend to warm the atmosphere. They are therefore\nunquestionably \u201cagent[s]\u201d of air pollution.\n                      Cite as: 549 U.

Even if\nsuch postenactment legislative history could shed light on\nthe meaning of an otherwise-unambiguous statute, EPA\nnever identifies any action remotely suggesting that Con\ngress meant to curtail its power to treat greenhouse gases\nas air pollutants. That subsequent Congresses have es\nchewed enacting binding emissions limitations to combat\nglobal warming tells us nothing about what Congress\nmeant when it amended \u00a7202(a)(1) in 1970 and 1977.27\nAnd unlike EPA, we have no difficulty reconciling Con\ngress\u2019 various efforts to promote interagency collaboration\nand research to better understand climate change28 with\nthe agency\u2019s pre-existing mandate to regulate \u201cany air\npollutant\u201d that may endanger the public welfare.

S. 120, is similarly misplaced. In holding that\ntobacco products are not \u201cdrugs\u201d or \u201cdevices\u201d subject to\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation pursuant\nto the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), see 529 U. S.,\nat 133, we found critical at least two considerations that\nhave no counterpart in this case.\n  First, we thought it unlikely that Congress meant to ban\ntobacco products, which the FDCA would have required\nhad such products been classified as \u201cdrugs\u201d or \u201cdevices.\u201d\nId., at 135\u2013137. Here, in contrast, EPA jurisdiction would\nlead to no such extreme measures. EPA would only regu\nlate emissions, and even then, it would have to delay any\naction \u201cto permit the development and application of the\nrequisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to\nthe cost of compliance,\u201d \u00a77521(a)(2). However much a ban\non tobacco products clashed with the \u201ccommon sense\u201d\nintuition that Congress never meant to remove those\nproducts from circulation, Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S.,\nat 133, there is nothing counterintuitive to the notion that\nEPA can curtail the emission of substances that are put\nting the global climate out of kilter.\n  Second, in Brown & Williamson we pointed to an unbro\nken series of congressional enactments that made sense\nonly if adopted \u201cagainst the backdrop of the FDA\u2019s consis\ntent and repeated statements that it lacked authority under\nthe FDCA to regulate tobacco.\u201d Id., at 144. We can point to\nno such enactments here: EPA has not identified any con\ngressional action that conflicts in any way with the regula\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  29 We are moreover puzzled by EPA\u2019s roundabout argument that be\ncause later Congresses chose to address stratospheric ozone pollution in\na specific legislative provision, it somehow follows that greenhouse\ngases cannot be air pollutants within the meaning of the Clean Air Act.\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)          29\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles. Even if\nit had, Congress could not have acted against a regulatory\n\u201cbackdrop\u201d of disclaimers of regulatory authority. Prior to\nthe order that provoked this litigation, EPA had never\ndisavowed the authority to regulate greenhouse gases, and\nin 1998 it in fact affirmed that it had such authority. See\nApp. 54 (Cannon memorandum). There is no reason, much\nless a compelling reason, to accept EPA\u2019s invitation to read\nambiguity into a clear statute.\n   EPA finally argues that it cannot regulate carbon diox\nide emissions from motor vehicles because doing so would\nrequire it to tighten mileage standards, a job (according to\nEPA) that Congress has assigned to DOT. See 68 Fed.\nReg. 52929. But that DOT sets mileage standards in no\nway licenses EPA to shirk its environmental responsibili\nties. EPA has been charged with protecting the public\u2019s\n\u201chealth\u201d and \u201cwelfare,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a77521(a)(1), a statutory\nobligation wholly independent of DOT\u2019s mandate to pro\nmote energy efficiency. See Energy Policy and Conserva\ntion Act, \u00a72(5), 89 Stat. 874, 42 U. S. C. \u00a76201(5). The two\nobligations may overlap, but there is no reason to think\nthe two agencies cannot both administer their obligations\nand yet avoid inconsistency.\n   While the Congresses that drafted \u00a7202(a)(1) might not\nhave appreciated the possibility that burning fossil fuels\ncould lead to global warming, they did understand that\nwithout regulatory flexibility, changing circumstances and\nscientific developments would soon render the Clean Air\nAct obsolete. The broad language of \u00a7202(a)(1) reflects an\nintentional effort to confer the flexibility necessary to\nforestall such obsolescence. See Pennsylvania Dept. of\nCorrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212 (1998) (\u201c[T]he\nfact that a statute can be applied in situations not ex\npressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate\nambiguity.

Put another way, the use of the word \u201cjudg\nment\u201d is not a roving license to ignore the statutory text.\nIt is but a direction to exercise discretion within defined\nstatutory limits.\n   If EPA makes a finding of endangerment, the Clean Air\nAct requires the agency to regulate emissions of the dele\nterious pollutant from new motor vehicles. Ibid. (stating\nthat \u201c[EPA] shall by regulation prescribe . . . standards\napplicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any\nclass of new motor vehicles\u201d). EPA no doubt has signifi\ncant latitude as to the manner, timing, content, and coor\ndination of its regulations with those of other agencies.\nBut once EPA has responded to a petition for rulemaking,\nits reasons for action or inaction must conform to the\nauthorizing statute. Under the clear terms of the Clean\nAir Act, EPA can avoid taking further action only if it\ndetermines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to\nclimate change or if it provides some reasonable explana\ntion as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion\nto determine whether they do. Ibid. To the extent that\nthis constrains agency discretion to pursue other priorities\nof the Administrator or the President, this is the congres\nsional design.\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)          31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   EPA has refused to comply with this clear statutory\ncommand. Instead, it has offered a laundry list of reasons\nnot to regulate. For example, EPA said that a number of\nvoluntary executive branch programs already provide an\neffective response to the threat of global warming, 68 Fed.\nReg. 52932, that regulating greenhouse gases might im\npair the President\u2019s ability to negotiate with \u201ckey develop\ning nations\u201d to reduce emissions, id., at 52931, and that\ncurtailing motor-vehicle emissions would reflect \u201can ineffi\ncient, piecemeal approach to address the climate change\nissue,\u201d ibid.\n   Although we have neither the expertise nor the author\nity to evaluate these policy judgments, it is evident they\nhave nothing to do with whether greenhouse gas emis\nsions contribute to climate change. Still less do they\namount to a reasoned justification for declining to form a\nscientific judgment. In particular, while the President has\nbroad authority in foreign affairs, that authority does not\nextend to the refusal to execute domestic laws. In the\nGlobal Climate Protection Act of 1987, Congress author\nized the State Department\u2014not EPA\u2014to formulate United\nStates foreign policy with reference to environmental mat\nters relating to climate. See \u00a71103(c), 101 Stat. 1409. EPA\nhas made no showing that it issued the ruling in question\nhere after consultation with the State Department. Con\ngress did direct EPA to consult with other agencies in the\nformulation of its policies and rules, but the State Depart\nment is absent from that list. \u00a71103(b).\n   Nor can EPA avoid its statutory obligation by noting the\nuncertainty surrounding various features of climate change\nand concluding that it would therefore be better not to\nregulate at this time. See 68 Fed. Reg. 52930\u201352931. If the\nscientific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes EPA\nfrom making a reasoned judgment as to whether green\nhouse gases contribute to global warming, EPA must say\nso. That EPA would prefer not to regulate greenhouse\n32                 MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngases because of some residual uncertainty\u2014which, con\ntrary to JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s apparent belief, post, at 5\u20138, is\nin fact all that it said, see 68 Fed. Reg. 52929 (\u201cWe do not\nbelieve . . . that it would be either effective or appropriate\nfor EPA to establish [greenhouse gas] standards for motor\nvehicles at this time\u201d (emphasis added))\u2014is irrelevant.\nThe statutory question is whether sufficient information\nexists to make an endangerment finding.\n   In short, EPA has offered no reasoned explanation for\nits refusal to decide whether greenhouse gases cause or\ncontribute to climate change. Its action was therefore\n\u201carbitrary, capricious, . . . or otherwise not in accordance\nwith law.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a77607(d)(9)(A). We need not and do\nnot reach the question whether on remand EPA must\nmake an endangerment finding, or whether policy con\ncerns can inform EPA\u2019s actions in the event that it makes\nsuch a finding. Cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re\nsources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843\u2013844\n(1984).

Indeed, it may ultimately affect nearly everyone on\nthe planet in some potentially adverse way, and it may be\nthat governments have done too little to address it. It is\nnot a problem, however, that has escaped the attention of\npolicymakers in the Executive and Legislative Branches of\nour Government, who continue to consider regulatory,\nlegislative, and treaty-based means of addressing global\nclimate change.\n   Apparently dissatisfied with the pace of progress on this\nissue in the elected branches, petitioners have come to the\ncourts claiming broad-ranging injury, and attempting to\ntie that injury to the Government\u2019s alleged failure to\ncomply with a rather narrow statutory provision. I would\nreject these challenges as nonjusticiable. Such a conclu\nsion involves no judgment on whether global warming\nexists, what causes it, or the extent of the problem. Nor\ndoes it render petitioners without recourse. This Court\u2019s\nstanding jurisprudence simply recognizes that redress of\ngrievances of the sort at issue here \u201cis the function of\nCongress and the Chief Executive,\u201d not the federal courts.\nLujan v.

Citizens for\nBetter Environment, 523 U.

S. 737, 751 (1984) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). Applying that standard here, petitioners\nbear the burden of alleging an injury that is fairly trace\nable to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s failure to\npromulgate new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission\nstandards, and that is likely to be redressed by the pro\nspective issuance of such standards.\n   Before determining whether petitioners can meet this\nfamiliar test, however, the Court changes the rules. It\nasserts that \u201cStates are not normal litigants for the pur\nposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,\u201d and that given\n\u201cMassachusetts\u2019 stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign\ninterests, the Commonwealth is entitled to special solici\ntude in our standing analysis.\u201d Ante, at 15, 17 (emphasis\nadded).\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n  Relaxing Article III standing requirements because\nasserted injuries are pressed by a State, however, has no\nbasis in our jurisprudence, and support for any such \u201cspe\ncial solicitude\u201d is conspicuously absent from the Court\u2019s\nopinion. The general judicial review provision cited by the\nCourt, 42 U. S. C. \u00a77607(b)(1), affords States no special\nrights or status. The Court states that \u201cCongress has\nordered EPA to protect Massachusetts (among others)\u201d\nthrough the statutory provision at issue, \u00a77521(a)(1), and\nthat \u201cCongress has . . . recognized a concomitant proce\ndural right to challenge the rejection of its rulemaking\npetition as arbitrary and capricious.\u201d Ante, at 16. The\nreader might think from this unfortunate phrasing that\nCongress said something about the rights of States in this\nparticular provision of the statute. Congress knows how\nto do that when it wants to, see, e.g., \u00a77426(b) (affording\nStates the right to petition EPA to directly regulate cer\ntain sources of pollution), but it has done nothing of the\nsort here. Under the law on which petitioners rely, Con\ngress treated public and private litigants exactly the same.\n  Nor does the case law cited by the Court provide any\nsupport for the notion that Article III somehow implicitly\ntreats public and private litigants differently. The Court\nhas to go back a full century in an attempt to justify its\nnovel standing rule, but even there it comes up short. The\nCourt\u2019s analysis hinges on Georgia v. Tennessee Copper\nCo., 206 U. S. 230 (1907)\u2014a case that did indeed draw a\ndistinction between a State and private litigants, but\nsolely with respect to available remedies. The case had\nnothing to do with Article III standing.\n  In Tennessee Copper, the State of Georgia sought to\nenjoin copper companies in neighboring Tennessee from\ndischarging pollutants that were inflicting \u201ca wholesale\ndestruction of forests, orchards and crops\u201d in bordering\nGeorgia counties. Id., at 236. Although the State owned\nvery little of the territory allegedly affected, the Court\n4                  MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nreasoned that Georgia\u2014in its capacity as a \u201cquasi\nsovereign\u201d\u2014\u201chas an interest independent of and behind\nthe titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its\ndomain.\u201d Id., at 237. The Court explained that while\n\u201c[t]he very elements that would be relied upon in a suit\nbetween fellow-citizens as a ground for equitable relief\n[were] wanting,\u201d a State \u201cis not lightly to be required to\ngive up quasi-sovereign rights for pay.\u201d Ibid. Thus while\na complaining private litigant would have to make do with\na legal remedy\u2014one \u201cfor pay\u201d\u2014the State was entitled to\nequitable relief. See id., at 237\u2013238.\n   In contrast to the present case, there was no question in\nTennessee Copper about Article III injury. See id., at 238\u2013\n239. There was certainly no suggestion that the State\ncould show standing where the private parties could not;\nthere was no dispute, after all, that the private landown\ners had \u201can action at law.\u201d Id., at 238. Tennessee Copper\nhas since stood for nothing more than a State\u2019s right, in an\noriginal jurisdiction action, to sue in a representative\ncapacity as parens patriae. See, e.g., Maryland v. Louisi\nana, 451 U. S. 725, 737 (1981). Nothing about a State\u2019s\nability to sue in that capacity dilutes the bedrock require\nment of showing injury, causation, and redressability to\nsatisfy Article III.\n   A claim of parens patriae standing is distinct from an\nallegation of direct injury. See Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502\nU. S. 437, 448\u2013449, 451 (1992). Far from being a substi\ntute for Article III injury, parens patriae actions raise an\nadditional hurdle for a state litigant: the articulation of a\n\u201cquasi-sovereign interest\u201d \u201capart from the interests of\nparticular private parties.\u201d Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v.\nPuerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U. S. 592, 607 (1982) (em\nphasis added) (cited ante, at 16). Just as an association\nsuing on behalf of its members must show not only that it\nrepresents the members but that at least one satisfies\nArticle III requirements, so too a State asserting quasi\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsovereign interests as parens patriae must still show that\nits citizens satisfy Article III. Focusing on Massachu\nsetts\u2019s interests as quasi-sovereign makes the required\nshowing here harder, not easier. The Court, in effect,\ntakes what has always been regarded as a necessary condi\ntion for parens patriae standing\u2014a quasi-sovereign inter\nest\u2014and converts it into a sufficient showing for purposes\nof Article III.\n   What is more, the Court\u2019s reasoning falters on its own\nterms. The Court asserts that Massachusetts is entitled\nto \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d due to its \u201cquasi-sovereign inter\nests,\u201d ante, at 17, but then applies our Article III standing\ntest to the asserted injury of the State\u2019s loss of coastal\nproperty. See ante, at 19 (concluding that Massachusetts\n\u201chas alleged a particularized injury in its capacity as a\nlandowner\u201d (emphasis added)). In the context of parens\npatriae standing, however, we have characterized state\nownership of land as a \u201cnonsovereign interes[t]\u201d because a\nState \u201cis likely to have the same interests as other simi\nlarly situated proprietors.\u201d Alfred L. Snapp & Son, supra,\nat 601.\n   On top of everything else, the Court overlooks the fact\nthat our cases cast significant doubt on a State\u2019s standing\nto assert a quasi-sovereign interest\u2014as opposed to a direct\ninjury\u2014against the Federal Government. As a general\nrule, we have held that while a State might assert a quasi-\nsovereign right as parens patriae \u201cfor the protection of its\ncitizens, it is no part of its duty or power to enforce their\nrights in respect of their relations with the Federal Gov\nernment. In that field it is the United States, and not the\nState, which represents them.\u201d Massachusetts v. Mellon,\n262 U. S. 447, 485\u2013486 (1923) (citation omitted); see also\nAlfred L. Snapp & Son, supra, at 610, n. 16.\n   All of this presumably explains why petitioners never\ncited Tennessee Copper in their briefs before this Court or\nthe D. C. Circuit. It presumably explains why not one of\n6                     MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe legion of amici supporting petitioners ever cited the\ncase. And it presumably explains why not one of the three\njudges writing below ever cited the case either. Given that\none purpose of the standing requirement is \u201c \u2018to assure\nthat concrete adverseness which sharpens the presenta\ntion of issues upon which the court so largely depends for\nillumination,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 13\u201314 (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369\nU. S. 186, 204 (1962)), it is ironic that the Court today\nadopts a new theory of Article III standing for States\nwithout the benefit of briefing or argument on the point.1\n                              II\n  It is not at all clear how the Court\u2019s \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d\nfor Massachusetts plays out in the standing analysis,\nexcept as an implicit concession that petitioners cannot\nestablish standing on traditional terms. But the status of\nMassachusetts as a State cannot compensate for petition\ners\u2019 failure to demonstrate injury in fact, causation, and\nredressability.\n  When the Court actually applies the three-part test, it\nfocuses, as did the dissent below, see 415 F. 3d 50, 64\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Court seems to think we do not recognize that Tennessee Copper\n\nis a case about parens patriae standing, ante, at 17, n. 17, but we have\nno doubt about that. The point is that nothing in our cases (or Hart &\nWechsler) suggests that the prudential requirements for parens patriae\nstanding, see Republic of Venezuela v. Philip Morris Inc., 287 F. 3d 192,\n199, n. (CADC 2002) (observing that \u201cparens patriae is merely a species\nof prudential standing\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), can\nsomehow substitute for, or alter the content of, the \u201cirreducible consti\ntutional minimum\u201d requirements of injury in fact, causation, and\nredressability under Article III. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU. S. 555, 560 (1992).\n   Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U. S. 439 (1945), is not to the\ncontrary. As the caption makes clear enough, the fact that a State may\nassert rights under a federal statute as parens patriae in no way refutes\nour clear ruling that \u201c[a] State does not have standing as parens patriae\nto bring an action against the Federal Government.\u201d Alfred L.

J., dissenting\n\n(CADC 2005) (opinion of Tatel, J.), on the State\u2019s asserted\nloss of coastal land as the injury in fact. If petitioners rely\non loss of land as the Article III injury, however, they\nmust ground the rest of the standing analysis in that\nspecific injury. That alleged injury must be \u201cconcrete and\nparticularized,\u201d Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 560,\nand \u201cdistinct and palpable,\u201d Allen, 468 U. S., at 751 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted). Central to this concept\nof \u201cparticularized\u201d injury is the requirement that a plain\ntiff be affected in a \u201cpersonal and individual way,\u201d Defend\ners of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 560, n. 1, and seek relief that\n\u201cdirectly and tangibly benefits him\u201d in a manner distinct\nfrom its impact on \u201cthe public at large,\u201d id., at 573\u2013574.\nWithout \u201cparticularized injury, there can be no confidence\nof \u2018a real need to exercise the power of judicial review\u2019 or\nthat relief can be framed \u2018no broader than required by the\nprecise facts to which the court\u2019s ruling would be applied.\u2019 \u201d\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 508 (1975) (quoting\nSchlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S.\n208, 221\u2013222 (1974)).\n   The very concept of global warming seems inconsistent\nwith this particularization requirement. Global warming\nis a phenomenon \u201charmful to humanity at large,\u201d 415\nF. 3d, at 60 (Sentelle, J., dissenting in part and concurring\nin judgment), and the redress petitioners seek is focused\nno more on them than on the public generally\u2014it is liter\nally to change the atmosphere around the world.\n   If petitioners\u2019 particularized injury is loss of coastal\nland, it is also that injury that must be \u201cactual or immi\nnent, not conjectural or hypothetical,\u201d Defenders of Wild\nlife, supra, at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted),\n\u201creal and immediate,\u201d Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95,\n102 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted), and \u201ccer\ntainly impending,\u201d Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149,\n158 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   As to \u201cactual\u201d injury, the Court observes that \u201cglobal sea\n8                  MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nlevels rose somewhere between 10 and 20 centimeters over\nthe 20th century as a result of global warming\u201d and that\n\u201c[t]hese rising seas have already begun to swallow Massa\nchusetts\u2019 coastal land.\u201d Ante, at 19. But none of petition\ners\u2019 declarations supports that connection. One declara\ntion states that \u201ca rise in sea level due to climate change is\noccurring on the coast of Massachusetts, in the metropoli\ntan Boston area,\u201d but there is no elaboration. Petitioners\u2019\nStanding Appendix in No. 03\u20131361, etc. (CADC), p. 196\n(Stdg. App.). And the declarant goes on to identify a \u201csig\nnifican[t]\u201d non-global-warming cause of Boston\u2019s rising sea\nlevel: land subsidence. Id., at 197; see also id., at 216.\nThus, aside from a single conclusory statement, there is\nnothing in petitioners\u2019 43 standing declarations and ac\ncompanying exhibits to support an inference of actual loss\nof Massachusetts coastal land from 20th century global\nsea level increases. It is pure conjecture.\n   The Court\u2019s attempts to identify \u201cimminent\u201d or \u201ccer\ntainly impending\u201d loss of Massachusetts coastal land fares\nno better. See ante, at 19\u201320. One of petitioners\u2019 decla\nrants predicts global warming will cause sea level to rise\nby 20 to 70 centimeters by the year 2100. Stdg. App. 216.\nAnother uses a computer modeling program to map the\nCommonwealth\u2019s coastal land and its current elevation,\nand calculates that the high-end estimate of sea level rise\nwould result in the loss of significant state-owned coastal\nland. Id., at 179. But the computer modeling program\nhas a conceded average error of about 30 centimeters and\na maximum observed error of 70 centimeters. Id., at 177\u2013\n178. As an initial matter, if it is possible that the model\nunderrepresents the elevation of coastal land to an extent\nequal to or in excess of the projected sea level rise, it is\ndifficult to put much stock in the predicted loss of land.\nBut even placing that problem to the side, accepting a\ncentury-long time horizon and a series of compounded\nestimates renders requirements of imminence and imme\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

As is often the\ncase, the questions of causation and redressability overlap.\nSee Allen, 468 U. S., at 753, n. 19 (observing that the two\nrequirements were \u201cinitially articulated by this Court as\ntwo facets of a single causation requirement\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). And importantly, when a\nparty is challenging the Government\u2019s allegedly unlawful\nregulation, or lack of regulation, of a third party, satisfy\ning the causation and redressability requirements be\ncomes \u201csubstantially more difficult.\u201d Defenders of Wildlife,\nsupra, at 562 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nWarth, supra, at 504\u2013505.\n   Petitioners view the relationship between their injuries\nand EPA\u2019s failure to promulgate new motor vehicle green\nhouse gas emission standards as simple and direct: Do\nmestic motor vehicles emit carbon dioxide and other\ngreenhouse gases. Worldwide emissions of greenhouse\ngases contribute to global warming and therefore also to\npetitioners\u2019 alleged injuries. Without the new vehicle\n10                MASSACHUSETTS v.

J., dissenting\n\nstandards, greenhouse gas emissions\u2014and therefore\nglobal warming and its attendant harms\u2014have been\nhigher than they otherwise would have been; once EPA\nchanges course, the trend will be reversed.\n  The Court ignores the complexities of global warming,\nand does so by now disregarding the \u201cparticularized\u201d\ninjury it relied on in step one, and using the dire nature of\nglobal warming itself as a bootstrap for finding causation\nand redressability. First, it is important to recognize the\nextent of the emissions at issue here. Because local\ngreenhouse gas emissions disperse throughout the atmos\nphere and remain there for anywhere from 50 to 200\nyears, it is global emissions data that are relevant. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. A\u201373. According to one of petition\ners\u2019 declarations, domestic motor vehicles contribute about\n6 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions and 4 percent\nof global greenhouse gas emissions. Stdg. App. 232. The\namount of global emissions at issue here is smaller still;\n\u00a7202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act covers only new motor\nvehicles and new motor vehicle engines, so petitioners\u2019\ndesired emission standards might reduce only a fraction of\n4 percent of global emissions.\n  This gets us only to the relevant greenhouse gas emis\nsions; linking them to global warming and ultimately to\npetitioners\u2019 alleged injuries next requires consideration of\nfurther complexities. As EPA explained in its denial of\npetitioners\u2019 request for rulemaking,\n     \u201cpredicting future climate change necessarily involves\n     a complex web of economic and physical factors in\n     cluding: our ability to predict future global anthropo\n     genic emissions of [greenhouse gases] and aerosols;\n     the fate of these emissions once they enter the atmos\n     phere (e.g., what percentage are absorbed by vegeta\n     tion or are taken up by the oceans); the impact of\n     those emissions that remain in the atmosphere on the\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

J., dissenting\n\n    radiative properties of the atmosphere; changes in\n    critically important climate feedbacks (e.g., changes in\n    cloud cover and ocean circulation); changes in tem\n    perature characteristics (e.g., average temperatures,\n    shifts in daytime and evening temperatures); changes\n    in other climatic parameters (e.g., shifts in precipita\n    tion, storms); and ultimately the impact of such\n    changes on human health and welfare (e.g., increases\n    or decreases in agricultural productivity, human\n    health impacts).\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u201383 through\n    A\u201384.\n  Petitioners are never able to trace their alleged injuries\nback through this complex web to the fractional amount of\nglobal emissions that might have been limited with EPA\nstandards. In light of the bit-part domestic new motor\nvehicle greenhouse gas emissions have played in what\npetitioners describe as a 150-year global phenomenon, and\nthe myriad additional factors bearing on petitioners\u2019 al\nleged injury\u2014the loss of Massachusetts coastal land\u2014the\nconnection is far too speculative to establish causation.\n                             IV\n   Redressability is even more problematic. To the tenu\nous link between petitioners\u2019 alleged injury and the inde\nterminate fractional domestic emissions at issue here, add\nthe fact that petitioners cannot meaningfully predict what\nwill come of the 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emis\nsions that originate outside the United States. As the\nCourt acknowledges, \u201cdeveloping countries such as China\nand India are poised to increase greenhouse gas emissions\nsubstantially over the next century,\u201d ante, at 23, so the\ndomestic emissions at issue here may become an increas\ningly marginal portion of global emissions, and any de\ncreases produced by petitioners\u2019 desired standards are\nlikely to be overwhelmed many times over by emissions\nincreases elsewhere in the world.\n12                MASSACHUSETTS v. EPA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   Petitioners offer declarations attempting to address this\nuncertainty, contending that \u201c[i]f the U. S. takes steps to\nreduce motor vehicle emissions, other countries are very\nlikely to take similar actions regarding their own motor\nvehicles using technology developed in response to the\nU. S. program.\u201d Stdg. App. 220; see also id., at 311\u2013312.\nIn other words, do not worry that other countries will\ncontribute far more to global warming than will U. S.\nautomobile emissions; someone is bound to invent some\nthing, and places like the People\u2019s Republic of China or\nIndia will surely require use of the new technology, re\ngardless of cost. The Court previously has explained that\nwhen the existence of an element of standing \u201cdepends on\nthe unfettered choices made by independent actors not\nbefore the courts and whose exercise of broad and legiti\nmate discretion the courts cannot presume either to con\ntrol or to predict,\u201d a party must present facts supporting\nan assertion that the actor will proceed in such a manner.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 562 (quoting ASARCO\nInc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 615 (1989) (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.); internal quotation marks omitted). The\ndeclarations\u2019 conclusory (not to say fanciful) statements do\nnot even come close.\n   No matter, the Court reasons, because any decrease in\ndomestic emissions will \u201cslow the pace of global emissions\nincreases, no matter what happens elsewhere.\u201d Ante, at\n23. Every little bit helps, so Massachusetts can sue over\nany little bit.\n   The Court\u2019s sleight-of-hand is in failing to link up the\ndifferent elements of the three-part standing test. What\nmust be likely to be redressed is the particular injury in\nfact. The injury the Court looks to is the asserted loss of\nland. The Court contends that regulating domestic motor\nvehicle emissions will reduce carbon dioxide in the atmos\nphere, and therefore redress Massachusetts\u2019s injury. But\neven if regulation does reduce emissions\u2014to some inde\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nterminate degree, given events elsewhere in the world\u2014\nthe Court never explains why that makes it likely that the\ninjury in fact\u2014the loss of land\u2014will be redressed. School\nchildren know that a kingdom might be lost \u201call for the\nwant of a horseshoe nail,\u201d but \u201clikely\u201d redressability is a\ndifferent matter. The realities make it pure conjecture to\nsuppose that EPA regulation of new automobile emissions\nwill likely prevent the loss of Massachusetts coastal land.\n                              V\n   Petitioners\u2019 difficulty in demonstrating causation and\nredressability is not surprising given the evident mis\nmatch between the source of their alleged injury\u2014\ncatastrophic global warming\u2014and the narrow subject\nmatter of the Clean Air Act provision at issue in this suit.\nThe mismatch suggests that petitioners\u2019 true goal for this\nlitigation may be more symbolic than anything else. The\nconstitutional role of the courts, however, is to decide\nconcrete cases\u2014not to serve as a convenient forum for\npolicy debates. See Valley Forge Christian College v.\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State,\nInc., 454 U. S. 464, 472 (1982) (\u201c[Standing] tends to assure\nthat the legal questions presented to the court will be\nresolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating\nsociety, but in a concrete factual context conducive to\na realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial\naction\u201d).\n   When dealing with legal doctrine phrased in terms of\nwhat is \u201cfairly\u201d traceable or \u201clikely\u201d to be redressed, it is\nperhaps not surprising that the matter is subject to some\ndebate. But in considering how loosely or rigorously to\ndefine those adverbs, it is vital to keep in mind the pur\npose of the inquiry.

Students\nChallenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), 412\nU. S. 669 (1973). SCRAP involved \u201c[p]robably the most\nattenuated injury conferring Art.

According to the group, some of these\nresources might be taken from the Washington area,\nresulting in increased refuse that might find its way into\narea parks, harming the group\u2019s members. 412 U. S., at\n688.\n   Over time, SCRAP became emblematic not of the loose\nness of Article III standing requirements, but of how\nutterly manipulable they are if not taken seriously as a\nmatter of judicial self-restraint. SCRAP made standing\nseem a lawyer\u2019s game, rather than a fundamental limita\ntion ensuring that courts function as courts and not in\ntrude on the politically accountable branches.

The good news is that the Court\u2019s\n\u201cspecial solicitude\u201d for Massachusetts limits the future\napplicability of the diluted standing requirements applied\nin this case. The bad news is that the Court\u2019s self-\nprofessed relaxation of those Article III requirements has\ncaused us to transgress \u201cthe proper\u2014and properly lim\nited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u201d Allen, 468\nU.

Without citation of the statute or\nany other authority, the Court says yes. Why is that so?\nWhen Congress wishes to make private action force an\nagency\u2019s hand, it knows how to do so. See, e.g., Brock v.\nPierce County, 476 U. S. 253, 254\u2013255 (1986) (discussing\nthe Comprehensive Employment and Training Act\n(CETA), 92 Stat. 1926, 29 U. S.

Where does the CAA\nsay that the EPA Administrator is required to come to a\ndecision on this question whenever a rulemaking petition\nis filed? The Court points to no such provision because\nnone exists.\n   Instead, the Court invents a multiple-choice question\nthat the EPA Administrator must answer when a petition\nfor rulemaking is filed. The Administrator must exercise\nhis judgment in one of three ways: (a) by concluding that\nthe pollutant does cause, or contribute to, air pollution\nthat endangers public welfare (in which case EPA is re\nquired to regulate); (b) by concluding that the pollutant\ndoes not cause, or contribute to, air pollution that endan\ngers public welfare (in which case EPA is not required to\nregulate); or (c) by \u201cprovid[ing] some reasonable explana\ntion as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion\nto determine whether\u201d greenhouse gases endanger public\nwelfare, ante, at 30, (in which case EPA is not required to\nregulate).\n   I am willing to assume, for the sake of argument, that\n                     Cite as: 549 U.

The\nCourt, however, with no basis in text or precedent, rejects\nall of EPA\u2019s stated \u201cpolicy judgments\u201d as not \u201camount[ing]\nto a reasoned justification,\u201d ante, at 31, effectively narrow\ning the universe of potential reasonable bases to a single\none: Judgment can be delayed only if the Administrator\nconcludes that \u201cthe scientific uncertainty is [too] pro\nfound.\u201d Ibid.

As de\n     scribed in detail below, the President has laid out a\n     comprehensive approach to climate change that calls\n     for near-term voluntary actions and incentives along\n     with programs aimed at reducing scientific uncertain\n     ties and encouraging technological development so\n     that the government may effectively and efficiently\n     address the climate change issue over the long term.\n          .           .           .          .            .\n        \u201c[E]stablishing [greenhouse gas] emission standards\n     for U.

Con\n    sidering the large populations and growing economies\n    of some developing countries, increases in their\n    [greenhouse gas] emissions could quickly overwhelm\n    the effects of [greenhouse gas] reduction measures in\n    developed countries. Any potential benefit of EPA\n    regulation could be lost to the extent other nations de\n    cided to let their emissions significantly increase in\n    view of U. S. emissions reductions. Unavoidably, cli\n    mate change raises important foreign policy issues,\n    and it is the President\u2019s prerogative to address them.\u201d\n    68 Fed.

Thus, the various \u201cpolicy\u201d rationales, ante,\nat 31, that the Court criticizes are not \u201cdivorced from the\nstatutory text,\u201d ante, at 30, except in the sense that the\nstatutory text is silent, as texts are often silent about\npermissible reasons for the exercise of agency discretion.\nThe reasons the EPA gave are surely considerations ex\necutive agencies regularly take into account (and ought to\ntake into account) when deciding whether to consider\nentering a new field: the impact such entry would have on\nother Executive Branch programs and on foreign policy.\nThere is no basis in law for the Court\u2019s imposed limitation.\n  EPA\u2019s interpretation of the discretion conferred by the\nstatutory reference to \u201cits judgment\u201d is not only reason\nable, it is the most natural reading of the text. The Court\nnowhere explains why this interpretation is incorrect, let\nalone why it is not entitled to deference under Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837 (1984). As the Administrator acted within\nthe law in declining to make a \u201cjudgment\u201d for the policy\nreasons above set forth, I would uphold the decision to\ndeny the rulemaking petition on that ground alone.\n                              B\n  Even on the Court\u2019s own terms, however, the same\nconclusion follows. As mentioned above, the Court gives\nEPA the option of determining that the science is too\nuncertain to allow it to form a \u201cjudgment\u201d as to whether\ngreenhouse gases endanger public welfare. Attached to\nthis option (on what basis is unclear) is an essay require\nment: \u201cIf,\u201d the Court says, \u201cthe scientific uncertainty is so\nprofound that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned\njudgment as to whether greenhouse gases contribute to\nglobal warming, EPA must say so.\u201d Ante, at 31.

The report goes on to state, however, that\n    \u2018[b]ecause of the large and still uncertain level of\n    natural variability inherent in the climate record and\n    the uncertainties in the time histories of the various\n    forcing agents (and particularly aerosols), a [causal]\n    linkage between the buildup of greenhouse gases in\n    the atmosphere and the observed climate changes\n    during the 20th century cannot be unequivocally es\n    tablished. The fact that the magnitude of the ob\n    served warming is large in comparison to natural\n    variability as simulated in climate models is sugges\n    tive of such a linkage, but it does not constitute proof\n    of one because the model simulations could be defi\n    cient in natural variability on the decadal to century\n    time scale\u2019 (p. 17).\n       \u201cThe NRC also observed that \u2018there is considerable\n    uncertainty in current understanding of how the cli\n    mate system varies naturally and reacts to emissions\n    of [GHGs] and aerosols\u2019 (p. 1). As a result of that un\n    certainty, the NRC cautioned that \u2018current estimate of\n    the magnitude of future warming should be regarded\n    as tentative and subject to future adjustments (either\n    upward or downward).\u2019 Id. It further advised that\n    \u2018[r]educing the wide range of uncertainty inherent in\n    current model predictions of global climate change\n    will require major advances in understanding and\n    modeling of both (1) the factors that determine at\n             Cite as: 549 U.

Although there have been\nsubstantial advances in climate change science, there\ncontinue to be important uncertainties in our under\nstanding of the factors that may affect future climate\nchange and how it should be addressed. As the NRC\nexplained, predicting future climate change necessar\nily involves a complex web of economic and physical\nfactors including: Our ability to predict future global\nanthropogenic emissions of GHGs and aerosols; the\nfate of these emissions once they enter the atmos\nphere (e.g., what percentage are absorbed by vegeta\ntion or are taken up by the oceans); the impact of\nthose emissions that remain in the atmosphere on the\nradiative properties of the atmosphere; changes in\ncritically important climate feedbacks (e.g., changes in\ncloud cover and ocean circulation); changes in tem\nperature characteristics (e.g., average temperatures,\nshifts in daytime and evening temperatures); changes\nin other climatic parameters (e.g., shifts in precipita\ntion, storms); and ultimately the impact of such\nchanges on human health and welfare (e.g., increases\nor decreases in agricultural productivity, human\nhealth impacts). The NRC noted, in particular, that\n\u2018[t]he understanding of the relationships between\nweather/climate and human health is in its infancy\nand therefore the health consequences of climate\nchange are poorly understood\u2019 (p. 20). Substantial\nscientific uncertainties limit our ability to assess each\nof these factors and to separate out those changes re\nsulting from natural variability from those that are\ndirectly the result of increases in anthropogenic\n8                  MASSACHUSETTS v.

For such authorization, the Court relies on\nwhat it calls \u201cthe Clean Air Act\u2019s capacious definition of\n\u2018air pollutant.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 30.\n   \u201cAir pollutant\u201d is defined by the Act as \u201cany air pollution\nagent or combination of such agents, including any physi\ncal, chemical, . . . substance or matter which is emitted\ninto or otherwise enters the ambient air.\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a77602(g). The Court is correct that \u201c[c]arbon dioxide,\nmethane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons,\u201d ante, at\n26, fit within the second half of that definition: They are\n\u201cphysical, chemical, . . . substance[s] or matter which [are]\nemitted into or otherwise ente[r] the ambient air.\u201d But the\nCourt mistakenly believes this to be the end of the analy\nsis. In order to be an \u201cair pollutant\u201d under the Act\u2019s defi\nnition, the \u201csubstance or matter [being] emitted into . . .\nthe ambient air\u201d must also meet the first half of the defini\ntion\u2014namely, it must be an \u201cair pollution agent or combi\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnation of such agents.\u201d The Court simply pretends this\nhalf of the definition does not exist.\n   The Court\u2019s analysis faithfully follows the argument\nadvanced by petitioners, which focuses on the word \u201cin\ncluding\u201d in the statutory definition of \u201cair pollutant.\u201d See\nBrief for Petitioners 13\u201314. As that argument goes, any\nthing that follows the word \u201cincluding\u201d must necessarily\nbe a subset of whatever precedes it. Thus, if greenhouse\ngases qualify under the phrase following the word \u201cinclud\ning,\u201d they must qualify under the phrase preceding it.\nSince greenhouse gases come within the capacious phrase\n\u201cany physical, chemical, . . . substance or matter which is\nemitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air,\u201d they\nmust also be \u201cair pollution agent[s] or combination[s] of\nsuch agents,\u201d and therefore meet the definition of \u201cair\npollutant[s].\u201d\n   That is certainly one possible interpretation of the\nstatutory definition. The word \u201cincluding\u201d can indeed\nindicate that what follows will be an \u201cillustrative\u201d sam\npling of the general category that precedes the word.\nFederal Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co.,\n314 U. S. 95, 100 (1941). Often, however, the examples\nstanding alone are broader than the general category, and\nmust be viewed as limited in light of that category. The\nGovernment provides a helpful (and unanswered) exam\nple: \u201cThe phrase \u2018any American automobile, including any\ntruck or minivan,\u2019 would not naturally be construed to\nencompass a foreign-manufactured [truck or] minivan.\u201d\nBrief for Federal Respondent 34. The general principle\nenunciated\u2014that the speaker is talking about American\nautomobiles\u2014carries forward to the illustrative examples\n(trucks and minivans), and limits them accordingly, even\nthough in isolation they are broader. Congress often uses\nthe word \u201cincluding\u201d in this manner. In 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71782(a), for example, it refers to \u201ca proceeding in a for\neign or international tribunal, including criminal investi\n10                    MASSACHUSETTS v.

See also, e.g., 2\nU. S. C. \u00a754(a) (\u201cThe Clerk of the House of Representatives\nshall, at the request of a Member of the House of Repre\nsentatives, furnish to the Member, for official use only, one\nset of a privately published annotated version of the\nUnited States Code, including supplements and pocket\nparts\u201d); 22 U. S. C. \u00a72304(b)(1) (\u201cthe relevant findings of\nappropriate international organizations, including non\ngovernmental organizations\u201d).\n    In short, the word \u201cincluding\u201d does not require the\nCourt\u2019s (or the petitioners\u2019) result. It is perfectly reason\nable to view the definition of \u201cair pollutant\u201d in its entirety:\nAn air pollutant can be \u201cany physical, chemical, . . . sub\nstance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters\nthe ambient air,\u201d but only if it retains the general charac\nteristic of being an \u201cair pollution agent or combination of\nsuch agents.\u201d       This is precisely the conclusion EPA\nreached: \u201c[A] substance does not meet the CAA definition\nof \u2018air pollutant\u2019 simply because it is a \u2018physical, chemical,\n. . . substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise\nenters the ambient air.\u2019 It must also be an \u2018air pollution\nagent.\u2019 \u201d 68 Fed. Reg. 52929, n. 3. See also id., at 52928\n(\u201cThe root of the definition indicates that for a substance\nto be an \u2018air pollutant,\u2019 it must be an \u2018agent\u2019 of \u2018air pollu\ntion\u2019 \u201d). Once again, in the face of textual ambiguity, the\nCourt\u2019s application of Chevron deference to EPA\u2019s inter\npretation of the word \u201cincluding\u201d is nowhere to be found.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Not only is EPA\u2019s interpretation reasonable, it is far more plausible\n\nthan the Court\u2019s alternative.

S. C. \u00a77602(g). It follows\nthat everything airborne, from Frisbees to flatulence, qualifies as an\n\u201cair pollutant.\u201d This reading of the statute defies common sense.\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

Reg. 52925. Thus, in\ndeciding whether it had authority to regulate, EPA had to\ndetermine whether the concentration of greenhouse gases\nassertedly responsible for \u201cglobal climate change\u201d quali\nfies as \u201cair pollution.\u201d EPA began with the commonsense\nobservation that the \u201c[p]roblems associated with atmos\npheric concentrations of CO2,\u201d id., at 52927, bear little\nresemblance to what would naturally be termed \u201cair\npollution\u201d:\n      \u201cEPA\u2019s prior use of the CAA\u2019s general regulatory\n    provisions provides an important context. Since the\n    inception of the Act, EPA has used these provisions to\n    address air pollution problems that occur primarily at\n    ground level or near the surface of the earth. For ex\n    ample, national ambient air quality standards\n    (NAAQS) established under CAA section 109 address\n    concentrations of substances in the ambient air and\n    the related public health and welfare problems.

CO2, by contrast, is\n     fairly consistent in concentration throughout the\n     world\u2019s atmosphere up to approximately the lower\n     stratosphere.\u201d Id., at 52926\u201352927.\nIn other words, regulating the buildup of CO2 and other\ngreenhouse gases in the upper reaches of the atmosphere,\nwhich is alleged to be causing global climate change, is not\nakin to regulating the concentration of some substance\nthat is polluting the air.\n   We need look no further than the dictionary for confir\nmation that this interpretation of \u201cair pollution\u201d is emi\nnently reasonable. The definition of \u201cpollute,\u201d of course, is\n\u201c[t]o make or render impure or unclean.\u201d Webster\u2019s New\nInternational Dictionary 1910 (2d ed. 1949). And the first\nthree definitions of \u201cair\u201d are as follows: (1) \u201c[t]he invisible,\nodorless, and tasteless mixture of gases which surrounds\nthe earth\u201d; (2) \u201c[t]he body of the earth\u2019s atmosphere; esp.,\nthe part of it near the earth, as distinguished from the\nupper rarefied part\u201d; (3) \u201c[a] portion of air or of the air\nconsidered with respect to physical characteristics or as\naffecting the senses.\u201d Id., at 54.

The Council's response was unequivocal: \"If carbon dioxide continues to increase, the study group finds no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible.... A wait-and-see policy may mean waiting until it is too late.\"<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Congress next addressed the issue in 1987, when it enacted the Global Climate Protection Act, Title XI of Pub.L. 100-204, 101 Stat. 1407, note following 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2901. Finding that \"manmade pollution\u0097the release of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and other trace gases into the atmosphere\u0097may be producing a long-term and substantial increase in the average temperature on Earth,\" \u00a7 1102(1), 101 Stat. 1408, Congress directed EPA to propose to Congress a \"coordinated national policy on global climate change,\" \u00a7 1103(b), and ordered the Secretary of State to work \"through the channels of multilateral diplomacy\" and coordinate diplomatic efforts to combat global warming, \u00a7 1103(c). Congress emphasized that \"ongoing pollution and deforestation may be contributing now to an irreversible process\" and that \"[n]ecessary actions must be identified and implemented in time to protect the climate.\" \u00a7 1102(4).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the scientific understanding of climate change progressed. In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a multinational scientific body organized under the auspices of the United Nations, published its first comprehensive report on the topic. Drawing on expert opinions from across the globe, the IPCC concluded that \"emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of... greenhouse gases [which] will enhance the greenhouse effect, resulting on average in an additional warming of the Earth's surface.\"<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Responding to the IPCC report, the United Nations convened the \"Earth Summit\" in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. The first President Bush attended and signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a nonbinding agreement among 154 nations to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases for the purpose of \"prevent[ing] dangerous anthropogenic [<i>i.e.,</i> human-induced] interference with the [Earth's] climate system.\"<sup>[13]</sup> S. Treaty Doc. No. 102-38, Art. 2, p. 5 (1992). The Senate unanimously ratified the treaty.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1449</span> Some five years later\u0097after the IPCC issued a second comprehensive report in 1995 concluding that \"[t]he balance of evidence suggests there is a discernible human influence on global climate\"<sup>[14]</sup>\u0097the UNFCCC signatories met in Kyoto, Japan, and adopted a protocol that assigned mandatory targets for industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Because those targets did not apply to developing and heavily polluting nations such as China and India, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution expressing its sense that the United States should not enter into the Kyoto Protocol. See S. Res. 98, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (July 25, 1997) (as passed). President Clinton did not submit the protocol to the Senate for ratification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>On October 20, 1999, a group of 19 private organizations<sup>[15]</sup> filed a rulemaking petition asking EPA to regulate \"greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under \u00a7 202 of the Clean Air Act.\" App. 5. Petitioners maintained that 1998 was the \"warmest year on record\"; that carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons are \"heat trapping greenhouse gases\"; that greenhouse gas emissions have significantly accelerated climate change; and that the IPCC's 1995 report warned that \"carbon dioxide remains the most important contributor to [man-made] forcing of climate change.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted). The petition further alleged that climate change will have serious adverse effects on human health and the environment. <i>Id.,</i> at 22-35. As to EPA's statutory authority, the petition observed that the agency itself had already confirmed that it had the power to regulate carbon dioxide. See <i>id.,</i> at 18, n. 21. In 1998, Jonathan Z. Cannon, then EPA's General Counsel, prepared a legal opinion concluding that \"CO2 emissions are within the scope of EPA's authority to regulate,\" even as he recognized that EPA had so far declined to exercise that authority. <i>Id.,</i> at 54 (memorandum to Carol M. Browner, Administrator (Apr. 10, 1998) (hereinafter Cannon memorandum)). Cannon's successor, Gary S. Guzy, reiterated that opinion before a congressional committee just two weeks before the rulemaking petition was filed. See <i>id.,</i> at 61.</p>\n<p>Fifteen months after the petition's submission, EPA requested public comment on \"all the issues raised in [the] petition,\" adding a \"particular\" request for comments on \"any scientific, technical, legal, economic or other aspect of these issues that may be relevant to EPA's consideration of this petition.\" 66 Fed.Reg. 7486, 7487 (2001). EPA received more than 50,000 comments over the next five months. See 68 Fed.Reg. 52924 (2003).</p>\n<p>Before the close of the comment period, the White House sought \"assistance in identifying the areas in the science of climate change where there are the greatest certainties and uncertainties\" from the National Research Council, asking for a response \"as soon as possible.\" App. 213. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1450</span> The result was a 2001 report titled Climate Change: An Analysis of Some Key Questions (NRC Report), which, drawing heavily on the 1995 IPCC report, concluded that \"[g]reenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. Temperatures are, in fact, rising.\" NRC Report 1.</p>\n<p>On September 8, 2003, EPA entered an order denying the rulemaking petition. 68 Fed.Reg. 52922. The agency gave two reasons for its decision: (1) that contrary to the opinions of its former general counsels, the Clean Air Act does not authorize EPA to issue mandatory regulations to address global climate change, see <i>id.,</i> at 52925-52929; and (2) that even if the agency had the authority to set greenhouse gas emission standards, it would be unwise to do so at this time, <i>id.,</i> at 52929-52931.</p>\n<p>In concluding that it lacked statutory authority over greenhouse gases, EPA observed that Congress \"was well aware of the global climate change issue when it last comprehensively amended the [Clean Air Act] in 1990,\" yet it declined to adopt a proposed amendment establishing binding emissions limitations. <i>Id.,</i> at 52926. Congress instead chose to authorize further investigation into climate change. <i>Ibid.</i> (citing \u00a7\u00a7 103(g) and 602(e) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 104 Stat. 2652, 2703, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7403(g)(1) and 7671a(e)). EPA further reasoned that Congress' \"specially tailored solutions to global atmospheric issues,\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52926\u0097in particular, its 1990 enactment of a comprehensive scheme to regulate pollutants that depleted the ozone layer, see Title VI, 104 Stat. 2649, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7671-7671q\u0097counseled against reading the general authorization of \u00a7 202(a)(1) to confer regulatory authority over greenhouse gases.</p>\n<p>EPA stated that it was \"urged on in this view\" by this Court's decision in <i>FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118347\"><a href=\"/opinion/118347/fda-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000). In that case, relying on \"tobacco['s] unique political history,\" <i>id.,</i> at 159, 120 S.Ct. 1291, we invalidated the Food and Drug Administration's reliance on its general authority to regulate drugs as a basis for asserting jurisdiction over an \"industry constituting a significant portion of the American economy,\" <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>EPA reasoned that climate change had its own \"political history\": Congress designed the original Clean Air Act to address <i>local</i> air pollutants rather than a substance that \"is fairly consistent in its concentration throughout the <i>world's</i> atmosphere,\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52927 (emphasis added); declined in 1990 to enact proposed amendments to force EPA to set carbon dioxide emission standards for motor vehicles, <i>ibid.</i> (citing H.R. 5966, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990)); and addressed global climate change in other legislation, 68 Fed. Reg. 52927. Because of this political history, and because imposing emission limitations on greenhouse gases would have even greater economic and political repercussions than regulating tobacco, EPA was persuaded that it lacked the power to do so. <i>Id.,</i> at 52928. In essence, EPA concluded that climate change was so important that unless Congress spoke with exacting specificity, it could not have meant the agency to address it.</p>\n<p>Having reached that conclusion, EPA believed it followed that greenhouse gases cannot be \"air pollutants\" within the meaning of the Act. See <i>ibid.</i> (\"It follows from this conclusion, that [greenhouse gases], as such, are not air pollutants under the [Clean Air Act's] regulatory provisions...\"). The agency bolstered this conclusion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1451</span> by explaining that if carbon dioxide were an air pollutant, the only feasible method of reducing tailpipe emissions would be to improve fuel economy. But because Congress has already created detailed mandatory fuel economy standards subject to Department of Transportation (DOT) administration, the agency concluded that EPA regulation would either conflict with those standards or be superfluous. <i>Id.,</i> at 52929.</p>\n<p>Even assuming that it had authority over greenhouse gases, EPA explained in detail why it would refuse to exercise that authority. The agency began by recognizing that the concentration of greenhouse gases has dramatically increased as a result of human activities, and acknowledged the attendant increase in global surface air temperatures. <i>Id.,</i> at 52930. EPA nevertheless gave controlling importance to the NRC Report's statement that a causal link between the two \"`cannot be unequivocally established.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting NRC Report 17). Given that residual uncertainty, EPA concluded that regulating greenhouse gas emissions would be unwise. 68 Fed.Reg. 52930.</p>\n<p>The agency furthermore characterized any EPA regulation of motor-vehicle emissions as a \"piecemeal approach\" to climate change, <i>id.,</i> at 52931, and stated that such regulation would conflict with the President's \"comprehensive approach\" to the problem, <i>id.,</i> at 52932. That approach involves additional support for technological innovation, the creation of nonregulatory programs to encourage voluntary private-sector reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and further research on climate change\u0097not actual regulation. <i>Id.,</i> at 52932-52933. According to EPA, unilateral EPA regulation of motor-vehicle greenhouse gas emissions might also hamper the President's ability to persuade key developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. <i>Id.,</i> at 52931.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Petitioners, now joined by intervenor States and local governments, sought review of EPA's order in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.<sup>[16]</sup> Although each of the three judges on the panel wrote a separate opinion, two judges agreed \"that the EPA Administrator properly exercised his discretion under \u00a7 202(a)(1) in denying the petition for rule making.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span>, 58 (2005). The court therefore denied the petition for review.</p>\n<p>In his opinion announcing the court's judgment, Judge Randolph avoided a definitive ruling as to petitioners' standing, <i>id.,</i> at 56, reasoning that it was permissible to proceed to the merits because the standing and the merits inquiries \"overlap[ped],\" <i>ibid.</i> Assuming without deciding that the statute authorized the EPA Administrator to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that \"in his judgment\" may \"reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1), Judge Randolph concluded that the exercise of that judgment need not be based solely on scientific evidence, but may also be informed by the sort of policy judgments that motivate congressional action. 415 F.3d, at 58. Given that framework, it was reasonable for EPA to base its decision on scientific uncertainty as well as on other factors, including the concern that unilateral regulation of U.S. motor-vehicle emissions could weaken efforts to reduce <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1452</span> greenhouse gas emissions from other countries. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Judge Sentelle wrote separately because he believed petitioners failed to \"demonstrat[e] the element of injury necessary to establish standing under Article III.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 59 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring in judgment). In his view, they had alleged that global warming is \"harmful to humanity at large,\" but could not allege \"particularized injuries\" to themselves. <i>Id.,</i> at 60 (citing <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 562, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)). While he dissented on standing, however, he accepted the contrary view as the law of the case and joined Judge Randolph's judgment on the merits as the closest to that which he preferred. 415 F.3d, at 60-61.</p>\n<p>Judge Tatel dissented. Emphasizing that EPA nowhere challenged the factual basis of petitioners' affidavits, <i>id.,</i> at 66, he concluded that at least Massachusetts had \"satisfied each element of Article III standing\u0097injury, causation, and redressability,\" <i>id.,</i> at 64. In Judge Tatel's view, the \"`substantial probability,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 66, that projected rises in sea level would lead to serious loss of coastal property was a \"far cry\" from the kind of generalized harm insufficient to ground Article III jurisdiction. <i>Id.,</i> at 65. He found that petitioners' affidavits more than adequately supported the conclusion that EPA's failure to curb greenhouse gas emissions contributed to the sea level changes that threatened Massachusetts' coastal property. <i>Ibid.</i> As to redressability, he observed that one of petitioners' experts, a former EPA climatologist, stated that \"`[a]chievable reductions in emissions of CO2 and other [greenhouse gases] from U.S. motor vehicles would ... delay and moderate many of the adverse impacts of global warming.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting declaration of Michael MacCracken, former Executive Director, U.S. Global Change Research Program \u00b6 5(e) (hereinafter MacCracken Decl.), available in 2 Petitioners' Standing Appendix in No. 03-1361, etc., (CADC), p. 209 (Stdg.App.)). He further noted that the one-time director of EPA's motor-vehicle pollution control efforts stated in an affidavit that enforceable emission standards would lead to the development of new technologies that \"`would gradually be mandated by other countries around the world.'\" 415 F.3d, at 66 (quoting declaration of Michael Walsh \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 10, Stdg. App. 309-310, 311). On the merits, Judge Tatel explained at length why he believed the text of the statute provided EPA with authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and why its policy concerns did not justify its refusal to exercise that authority. 415 F.3d, at 67-82.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Article III of the Constitution limits federal-court jurisdiction to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" Those two words confine \"the business of federal courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.\" <i>Flast v.

It is therefore familiar learning that no justiciable \"controversy\" exists when parties seek adjudication of a political question, <i>Luther v.

This case suffers from none of these defects.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1453</span> The parties' dispute turns on the proper construction of a congressional statute, a question eminently suitable to resolution in federal court. Congress has moreover authorized this type of challenge to EPA action. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). That authorization is of critical importance to the standing inquiry: \"Congress has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before.\" <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S., at 580, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). \"In exercising this power, however, Congress must at the very least identify the injury it seeks to vindicate and relate the injury to the class of persons entitled to bring suit.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We will not, therefore, \"entertain citizen suits to vindicate the public's nonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the laws.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 581, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p>EPA maintains that because greenhouse gas emissions inflict widespread harm, the doctrine of standing presents an insuperable jurisdictional obstacle. We do not agree. At bottom, \"the gist of the question of standing\" is whether petitioners have \"such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination.\" <i>Baker v. Carr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106366\"><a href=\"/opinion/106366/baker-v-carr/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). As Justice KENNEDY explained in his <i>Lujan</i> concurrence:</p>\n<blockquote>\"While it does not matter how many persons have been injured by the challenged action, the party bringing suit must show that the action injures him in a concrete and personal way. This requirement is not just an empty formality. It preserves the vitality of the adversarial process by assuring both that the parties before the court have an actual, as opposed to professed, stake in the outcome, and that the legal questions presented ... will be resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.\" 504 U.S., at 581, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>To ensure the proper adversarial presentation, <i>Lujan</i> holds that a litigant must demonstrate that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent, that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant, and that it is likely that a favorable decision will redress that injury. See <i>id.,</i> at 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130. However, a litigant to whom Congress has \"accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests,\" <i>id.,</i> at 572, n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130\u0097here, the right to challenge agency action unlawfully withheld, \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u0097\"can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy,\" <i>ibid.</i> When a litigant is vested with a procedural right, that litigant has standing if there is some possibility that the requested relief will prompt the injury-causing party to reconsider the decision that allegedly harmed the litigant. <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Fla. v. Veneman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185684\"><a href=\"/opinion/185684/sugar-cane-growers-v-veneman-ann-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 94-95 (C.A.D.C.2002) (\"A [litigant] who alleges a deprivation of a procedural protection to which he is entitled never has to prove that if he had received the procedure the substantive result would have been altered. All that is necessary is to show that the procedural step was connected to the substantive result\").</p>\n<p>Only one of the petitioners needs to have standing to permit us to consider the petition for review. See <i>Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145672\"><a href=\"/opinion/145672/rumsfeld-v-forum-for-academic-and-institutional-ri/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 52, n. 2, 126 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1454</span> 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006). We stress here, as did Judge Tatel below, the special position and interest of Massachusetts. It is of considerable relevance that the party seeking review here is a sovereign State and not, as it was in <i>Lujan,</i> a private individual.</p>\n<p>Well before the creation of the modern administrative state, we recognized that States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction. As Justice Holmes explained in <i>Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96680\"><a href=\"/opinion/96680/georgia-v-tennesssee-copper-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 237, 27 S.Ct. 618, 51 L.Ed. 1038 (1907), a case in which Georgia sought to protect its citizens from air pollution originating outside its borders:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The case has been argued largely as if it were one between two private parties; but it is not. The very elements that would be relied upon in a suit between fellow-citizens as a ground for equitable relief are wanting here. The State owns very little of the territory alleged to be affected, and the damage to it capable of estimate in money, possibly, at least, is small. This is a suit by a State for an injury to it in its capacity of <i>quasi</i>-sovereign. In that capacity the State has an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain. It has the last word as to whether its mountains shall be stripped of their forests and its inhabitants shall breathe pure air.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Just as Georgia's \"independent interest... in all the earth and air within its domain\" supported federal jurisdiction a century ago, so too does Massachusetts' well-founded desire to preserve its sovereign territory today. Cf. <i>Alden v. Maine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118318\"><a href=\"/opinion/118318/alden-v-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 715, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999) (observing that in the federal system, the States \"are not relegated to the role of mere provinces or political corporations, but retain the dignity, though not the full authority, of sovereignty\"). That Massachusetts does in fact own a great deal of the \"territory alleged to be affected\" only reinforces the conclusion that its stake in the outcome of this case is sufficiently concrete to warrant the exercise of federal judicial power.</p>\n<p>When a State enters the Union, it surrenders certain sovereign prerogatives. Massachusetts cannot invade Rhode Island to force reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, it cannot negotiate an emissions treaty with China or India, and in some circumstances the exercise of its police powers to reduce in-state motor-vehicle emissions might well be pre-empted. See <i>Alfred L. Snapp &amp; Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110789\"><a href=\"/opinion/110789/alfred-l-snapp-son-inc-v-puerto-rico-ex-rel-barez/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 607, 102 S.Ct. 3260, 73 L.Ed.2d 995 (1982) (\"One helpful indication in determining whether an alleged injury to the health and welfare of its citizens suffices to give the State standing to sue <i>parens patriae</i> is whether the injury is one that the State, if it could, would likely attempt to address through its sovereign lawmaking powers\").</p>\n<p>These sovereign prerogatives are now lodged in the Federal Government, and Congress has ordered EPA to protect Massachusetts (among others) by prescribing standards applicable to the \"emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicle engines, which in [the Administrator's] judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1). Congress has moreover recognized a concomitant procedural right to challenge the rejection of its rulemaking petition as arbitrary and capricious. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Given that procedural right and Massachusetts' stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign interests, the Commonwealth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1455</span> is entitled to special solicitude in our standing analysis.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>With that in mind, it is clear that petitioners' submissions as they pertain to Massachusetts have satisfied the most demanding standards of the adversarial process. EPA's steadfast refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions presents a risk of harm to Massachusetts that is both \"actual\" and \"imminent.\" <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S., at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted). There is, moreover, a \"substantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested\" will prompt EPA to take steps to reduce that risk. <i>Duke Power Co. v.

He also observes that rising ocean temperatures may contribute to the ferocity of hurricanes. <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 23-25, at 216-217.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>That these climate-change risks are \"widely shared\" does not minimize Massachusetts' interest in the outcome of this litigation.

Akins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commn-v-akins/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 24, 118 S.Ct. 1777, 141 L.Ed.2d 10 (1998) (\"[W]here a harm is concrete, though widely shared, the Court has found `injury in fact'\"). According to petitioners' unchallenged affidavits, global sea levels rose somewhere between 10 and 20 centimeters over the 20th century as a result of global warming. MacCracken Decl. \u00b6 5(c), Stdg.App. 208. These rising seas have already begun to swallow Massachusetts' coastal land. <i>Id.,</i> at 196 (declaration of Paul H. Kirshen \u00b6 5), 216 (MacCracken Decl. \u00b6 23). Because the Commonwealth \"owns a substantial portion of the state's coastal property,\" <i>id.,</i> at 171 (declaration of Karst R. Hoogeboom \u00b6 4),<sup>[19]</sup> it has alleged a particularized injury in its capacity as a landowner. The severity of that injury will only increase over the course of the next century: If sea levels continue to rise as predicted, one Massachusetts official believes that a significant fraction of coastal property will be \"either permanently lost through inundation or temporarily lost through periodic storm surge and flooding events.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 6, at 172.<sup>[20]</sup> Remediation costs alone, petitioners allege, could run well into the hundreds of millions of dollars. <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 7, at 172; see also Kirshen Decl. \u00b6 12, at 198.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1457</span> <i>Causation</i>\n</h2>\n<p>EPA does not dispute the existence of a causal connection between man-made greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. At a minimum, therefore, EPA's refusal to regulate such emissions \"contributes\" to Massachusetts' injuries.</p>\n<p>EPA nevertheless maintains that its decision not to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles contributes so insignificantly to petitioners' injuries that the agency cannot be haled into federal court to answer for them. For the same reason, EPA does not believe that any realistic possibility exists that the relief petitioners seek would mitigate global climate change and remedy their injuries. That is especially so because predicted increases in greenhouse gas emissions from developing nations, particularly China and India, are likely to offset any marginal domestic decrease.</p>\n<p>But EPA overstates its case. Its argument rests on the erroneous assumption that a small incremental step, because it is incremental, can never be attacked in a federal judicial forum. Yet accepting that premise would doom most challenges to regulatory action. Agencies, like legislatures, do not generally resolve massive problems in one fell regulatory swoop. See <i>Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105285\"><a href=\"/opinion/105285/williamson-v-lee-optical-of-okla-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 489, 75 S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955) (\"[A] reform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind\"). They instead whittle away at them over time, refining their preferred approach as circumstances change and as they develop a more-nuanced understanding of how best to proceed. Cf. <i>SEC v. Chenery Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104462\"><a href=\"/opinion/104462/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 202, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) (\"Some principles must await their own development, while others must be adjusted to meet particular, unforeseeable situations\"). That a first step might be tentative does not by itself support the notion that federal courts lack jurisdiction to determine whether that step conforms to law.</p>\n<p>And reducing domestic automobile emissions is hardly a tentative step. Even leaving aside the other greenhouse gases, the United States transportation sector emits an enormous quantity of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere\u0097according to the MacCracken affidavit, more than 1.7 billion metric tons in 1999 alone. \u00b6 30, Stdg.App. 219. That accounts for more than 6% of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions. <i>Id.,</i> at 232 (Oppenheimer Decl. \u00b6 3); see also MacCracken Decl. \u00b6 31, at 220. To put this in perspective: Considering just emissions from the transportation sector, which represent less than one-third of this country's total carbon dioxide emissions, the United States would still rank as the third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, outpaced only by the European Union and China.<sup>[22]</sup> Judged by any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1458</span> standard, U.S. motor-vehicle emissions make a meaningful contribution to greenhouse gas concentrations and hence, according to petitioners, to global warming.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Remedy</i></h2>\n<p>While it may be true that regulating motor-vehicle emissions will not by itself <i>reverse</i> global warming, it by no means follows that we lack jurisdiction to decide whether EPA has a duty to take steps to <i>slow</i> or <i>reduce</i> it. See also <i>Larson v. Valente,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110697\"><a href=\"/opinion/110697/larson-v-valente/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 244, n. 15, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982) (\"[A] plaintiff satisfies the redressability requirement when he shows that a favorable decision will relieve a discrete injury to himself. He need not show that a favorable decision will relieve his <i>every</i> injury\"). Because of the enormity of the potential consequences associated with man-made climate change, the fact that the effectiveness of a remedy might be delayed during the (relatively short) time it takes for a new motor-vehicle fleet to replace an older one is essentially irrelevant.<sup>[23]</sup> Nor is it dispositive that developing countries such as China and India are poised to increase greenhouse gas emissions substantially over the next century: A reduction in domestic emissions would slow the pace of global emissions increases, no matter what happens elsewhere.</p>\n<p>We moreover attach considerable significance to EPA's \"agree[ment] with the President that `we must address the issue of global climate change,'\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52929 (quoting remarks announcing Clear Skies and Global Climate Initiatives, 2002 Public Papers of George W. Bush, Vol. 1, Feb. 14, p. 227 (2004)), and to EPA's ardent support for various voluntary emission-reduction programs, 68 Fed.Reg. 52932. As Judge Tatel observed in dissent below, \"EPA would presumably not bother with such efforts if it thought emissions reductions would have no discernable impact on future global warming.\" 415 F.3d, at 66.</p>\n<p>In sum\u0097at least according to petitioners' uncontested affidavits\u0097the rise in sea levels associated with global warming has already harmed and will continue to harm Massachusetts. The risk of catastrophic harm, though remote, is nevertheless real. That risk would be reduced to some extent if petitioners received the relief they seek. We therefore hold that petitioners have standing to challenge the EPA's denial of their rulemaking petition.<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1459</span> V</h2>\n<p>The scope of our review of the merits of the statutory issues is narrow. As we have repeated time and again, an agency has broad discretion to choose how best to marshal its limited resources and personnel to carry out its delegated responsibilities. See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 842-845, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). That discretion is at its height when the agency decides not to bring an enforcement action. Therefore, in <i>Heckler v. Chaney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span>, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985), we held that an agency's refusal to initiate enforcement proceedings is not ordinarily subject to judicial review. Some debate remains, however, as to the rigor with which we review an agency's denial of a petition for rulemaking.</p>\n<p>There are key differences between a denial of a petition for rulemaking and an agency's decision not to initiate an enforcement action. See <i>American Horse Protection Assn., Inc. v. Lyng,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483532\"><a href=\"/opinion/483532/american-horse-protection-association-inc-v-richar/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3-4 (C.A.D.C.1987). In contrast to nonenforcement decisions, agency refusals to initiate rulemaking \"are less frequent, more apt to involve legal as opposed to factual analysis, and subject to special formalities, including a public explanation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 4; see also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555(e). They moreover arise out of denials of petitions for rulemaking which (at least in the circumstances here) the affected party had an undoubted procedural right to file in the first instance. Refusals to promulgate rules are thus susceptible to judicial review, though such review is \"extremely limited\" and \"highly deferential.\" <i>National Customs Brokers &amp; Forwarders Assn. of America, Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528186\"><a href=\"/opinion/528186/national-customs-brokers-forwarders-association-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 96 (C.A.D.C.1989).</p>\n<p>EPA concluded in its denial of the petition for rulemaking that it lacked authority under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1) to regulate new vehicle emissions because carbon dioxide is not an \"air pollutant\" as that term is defined in \u00a7 7602. In the alternative, it concluded that even if it possessed authority, it would decline to do so because regulation would conflict with other administration priorities. As discussed earlier, the Clean Air Act expressly permits review of such an action. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). We therefore \"may reverse any such action found to be... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" \u00a7 7607(d)(9).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p>On the merits, the first question is whether \u00a7 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a \"judgment\" that such emissions contribute to climate change. We have little trouble concluding that it does. In relevant part, \u00a7 202(a)(1) provides that EPA \"shall by regulation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1460</span> prescribe ... standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which in [the Administrator's] judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1). Because EPA believes that Congress did not intend it to regulate substances that contribute to climate change, the agency maintains that carbon dioxide is not an \"air pollutant\" within the meaning of the provision.</p>\n<p>The statutory text forecloses EPA's reading. The Clean Air Act's sweeping definition of \"air pollutant\" includes \"<i>any</i> air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including <i>any</i> physical, chemical... substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air... .\" \u00a7 7602(g) (emphasis added). On its face, the definition embraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe, and underscores that intent through the repeated use of the word \"any.\"<sup>[25]</sup> Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons are without a doubt \"physical [and] chemical ... substance[s] which [are] emitted into ... the ambient air.\" The statute is unambiguous.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>Rather than relying on statutory text, EPA invokes postenactment congressional actions and deliberations it views as tantamount to a congressional command to refrain from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Even if such postenactment legislative history could shed light on the meaning of an otherwise-unambiguous statute, EPA never identifies any action remotely suggesting that Congress meant to curtail its power to treat greenhouse gases as air pollutants. That subsequent Congresses have eschewed enacting binding emissions limitations to combat global warming tells us nothing about what Congress meant when it amended \u00a7 202(a)(1) in 1970 and 1977.<sup>[27]</sup> And unlike EPA, we have no difficulty reconciling Congress' various efforts to promote interagency collaboration and research to better understand <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1461</span> climate change<sup>[28]</sup> with the agency's pre-existing mandate to regulate \"any air pollutant\" that may endanger the public welfare. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7601(a)(1). Collaboration and research do not conflict with any thoughtful regulatory effort; they complement it.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p>EPA's reliance on <i>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118347\"><a href=\"/opinion/118347/fda-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121, is similarly misplaced. In holding that tobacco products are not \"drugs\" or \"devices\" subject to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), see 529 U.S., at 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291, we found critical at least two considerations that have no counterpart in this case.</p>\n<p>First, we thought it unlikely that Congress meant to ban tobacco products, which the FDCA would have required had such products been classified as \"drugs\" or \"devices.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 135-137, 120 S.Ct. 1291. Here, in contrast, EPA jurisdiction would lead to no such extreme measures. EPA would only <i>regulate</i> emissions, and even then, it would have to delay any action \"to permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance,\" \u00a7 7521(a)(2). However much a ban on tobacco products clashed with the \"common sense\" intuition that Congress never meant to remove those products from circulation, <i>Brown &amp; Williamson,</i> 529 U.S., at 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291, there is nothing counterintuitive to the notion that EPA can curtail the emission of substances that are putting the global climate out of kilter.</p>\n<p>Second, in <i>Brown &amp; Williamson</i> we pointed to an unbroken series of congressional enactments that made sense only if adopted \"against the backdrop of the FDA's consistent and repeated statements that it lacked authority under the FDCA to regulate tobacco.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 144, 120 S.Ct. 1291. We can point to no such enactments here: EPA has not identified any congressional action that conflicts in any way with the regulation of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles. Even if it had, Congress could not have acted against a regulatory \"backdrop\" of disclaimers of regulatory authority. Prior to the order that provoked this litigation, EPA had never disavowed the authority to regulate greenhouse gases, and in 1998 it in fact affirmed that it <i>had</i> such authority. See App. 54 (Cannon memorandum). There is no reason, much less a compelling reason, to accept EPA's invitation to read ambiguity into a clear statute.</p>\n<p>EPA finally argues that it cannot regulate carbon dioxide emissions from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1462</span> motor vehicles because doing so would require it to tighten mileage standards, a job (according to EPA) that Congress has assigned to DOT. See 68 Fed.Reg. 52929. But that DOT sets mileage standards in no way licenses EPA to shirk its environmental responsibilities. EPA has been charged with protecting the public's \"health\" and \"welfare,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1), a statutory obligation wholly independent of DOT's mandate to promote energy efficiency. See Energy Policy and Conservation Act, \u00a7 2(5), 89 Stat. 874, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6201(5). The two obligations may overlap, but there is no reason to think the two agencies cannot both administer their obligations and yet avoid inconsistency.</p>\n<p>While the Congresses that drafted \u00a7 202(a)(1) might not have appreciated the possibility that burning fossil fuels could lead to global warming, they did understand that without regulatory flexibility, changing circumstances and scientific developments would soon render the Clean Air Act obsolete. The broad language of \u00a7 202(a)(1) reflects an intentional effort to confer the flexibility necessary to forestall such obsolescence. See <i>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118228\"><a href=\"/opinion/118228/pennsylvania-dept-of-corrections-v-yeskey/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 212, 118 S.Ct. 1952, 141 L.Ed.2d 215 (1998) (\"[T]he fact that a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It demonstrates breadth\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because greenhouse gases fit well within the Clean Air Act's capacious definition of \"air pollutant,\" we hold that EPA has the statutory authority to regulate the emission of such gases from new motor vehicles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII</h2>\n<p>The alternative basis for EPA's decision\u0097that even if it does have statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gases, it would be unwise to do so at this time\u0097rests on reasoning divorced from the statutory text. While the statute does condition the exercise of EPA's authority on its formation of a \"judgment,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1), that judgment must relate to whether an air pollutant \"cause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\" <i>ibid.</i> Put another way, the use of the word \"judgment\" is not a roving license to ignore the statutory text. It is but a direction to exercise discretion within defined statutory limits.</p>\n<p>If EPA makes a finding of endangerment, the Clean Air Act requires the agency to regulate emissions of the deleterious pollutant from new motor vehicles. <i>Ibid.</i> (stating that \"[EPA] shall by regulation prescribe ... standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class of new motor vehicles\"). EPA no doubt has significant latitude as to the manner, timing, content, and coordination of its regulations with those of other agencies. But once EPA has responded to a petition for rulemaking, its reasons for action or inaction must conform to the authorizing statute. Under the clear terms of the Clean Air Act, EPA can avoid taking further action only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do. <i>Ibid.</i> To the extent that this constrains agency discretion to pursue other priorities of the Administrator or the President, this is the congressional design.</p>\n<p>EPA has refused to comply with this clear statutory command. Instead, it has offered a laundry list of reasons not to regulate. For example, EPA said that a number of voluntary executive branch programs already provide an effective response to the threat of global warming, 68 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1463</span> Fed.Reg. 52932, that regulating greenhouse gases might impair the President's ability to negotiate with \"key developing nations\" to reduce emissions, <i>id.,</i> at 52931, and that curtailing motor-vehicle emissions would reflect \"an inefficient, piecemeal approach to address the climate change issue,\" <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Although we have neither the expertise nor the authority to evaluate these policy judgments, it is evident they have nothing to do with whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change. Still less do they amount to a reasoned justification for declining to form a scientific judgment. In particular, while the President has broad authority in foreign affairs, that authority does not extend to the refusal to execute domestic laws. In the Global Climate Protection Act of 1987, Congress authorized the State Department\u0097not EPA\u0097to formulate United States foreign policy with reference to environmental matters relating to climate. See \u00a7 1103(c), 101 Stat. 1409. EPA has made no showing that it issued the ruling in question here after consultation with the State Department. Congress did direct EPA to consult with other agencies in the formulation of its policies and rules, but the State Department is absent from that list. \u00a7 1103(b).</p>\n<p>Nor can EPA avoid its statutory obligation by noting the uncertainty surrounding various features of climate change and concluding that it would therefore be better not to regulate at this time. See 68 Fed.Reg. 52930-52931. If the scientific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment as to whether greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, EPA must say so. That EPA would prefer not to regulate greenhouse gases because of some residual uncertainty\u0097which, contrary to Justice SCALIA's apparent belief, <i>post,</i> at 1466-1468, is in fact all that it said, see 68 Fed.Reg. 52929 (\"We do not believe ... that it would be either effective or appropriate for EPA <i>to establish [greenhouse gas] standards for motor vehicles</i> at this time\" (emphasis added))\u0097is irrelevant. The statutory question is whether sufficient information exists to make an endangerment finding.</p>\n<p>In short, EPA has offered no reasoned explanation for its refusal to decide whether greenhouse gases cause or contribute to climate change. Its action was therefore \"arbitrary, capricious, ... or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(9)(A). We need not and do not reach the question whether on remand EPA must make an endangerment finding, or whether policy concerns can inform EPA's actions in the event that it makes such a finding. Cf. <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843-844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We hold only that EPA must ground its reasons for action or inaction in the statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VIII</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice SCALIA, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Global warming may be a \"crisis,\" even \"the most pressing environmental problem of our time.\" Pet. for Cert. 26, 22.

It is not a problem, however, that has escaped the attention of policymakers in the Executive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1464</span> and Legislative Branches of our Government, who continue to consider regulatory, legislative, and treaty-based means of addressing global climate change.</p>\n<p>Apparently dissatisfied with the pace of progress on this issue in the elected branches, petitioners have come to the courts claiming broad-ranging injury, and attempting to tie that injury to the Government's alleged failure to comply with a rather narrow statutory provision. I would reject these challenges as nonjusticiable. Such a conclusion involves no judgment on whether global warming exists, what causes it, or the extent of the problem. Nor does it render petitioners without recourse. This Court's standing jurisprudence simply recognizes that redress of grievances of the sort at issue here \"is the function of Congress and the Chief Executive,\" not the federal courts. <i>Lujan v.

Applying that standard here, petitioners bear the burden of alleging an injury that is fairly traceable to the Environmental Protection Agency's failure to promulgate new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards, and that is likely to be redressed by the prospective issuance of such standards.</p>\n<p>Before determining whether petitioners can meet this familiar test, however, the Court changes the rules. It asserts that \"States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,\" and that given \"Massachusetts' stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign interests, the Commonwealth is entitled to <i>special solicitude</i> in our standing analysis.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1454, 1455 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Relaxing Article III standing requirements because asserted injuries are pressed by a State, however, has no basis in our jurisprudence, and support for any such \"special solicitude\" is conspicuously absent from the Court's opinion. The general judicial review provision cited by the Court, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1), affords States no special rights or status. The Court states that \"Congress has ordered EPA to protect Massachusetts (among others)\" through the statutory provision at issue, \u00a7 7521(a)(1), and that \"Congress has... recognized a concomitant procedural right to challenge the rejection of its rule-making petition as arbitrary and capricious.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1454. The reader might think from this unfortunate phrasing that Congress said something about the rights <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1465</span> of States in this particular provision of the statute. Congress knows how to do that when it wants to, see, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 7426(b) (affording States the right to petition EPA to directly regulate certain sources of pollution), but it has done nothing of the sort here. Under the law on which petitioners rely, Congress treated public and private litigants exactly the same.</p>\n<p>Nor does the case law cited by the Court provide any support for the notion that Article III somehow implicitly treats public and private litigants differently. The Court has to go back a full century in an attempt to justify its novel standing rule, but even there it comes up short. The Court's analysis hinges on <i>Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96680\"><a href=\"/opinion/96680/georgia-v-tennesssee-copper-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 27 S.Ct. 618, 51 L.Ed. 1038 (1907)\u0097a case that did indeed draw a distinction between a State and private litigants, but solely with respect to available remedies. The case had nothing to do with Article III standing.</p>\n<p>In <i>Tennessee Copper,</i> the State of Georgia sought to enjoin copper companies in neighboring Tennessee from discharging pollutants that were inflicting \"a wholesale destruction of forests, orchards and crops\" in bordering Georgia counties. <i>Id.,</i> at 236, 27 S.Ct. 618. Although the State owned very little of the territory allegedly affected, the Court reasoned that Georgia\u0097in its capacity as a \"<i>quasi</i>-sovereign\"\u0097\"has an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 237, 27 S.Ct. 618. The Court explained that while \"[t]he very elements that would be relied upon in a suit between fellow-citizens as a ground for equitable relief [were] wanting,\" a State \"is not lightly to be required to give up <i>quasi</i>-sovereign rights for pay.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Thus while a complaining private litigant would have to make do with a <i>legal</i> remedy\u0097one \"for pay\"\u0097the State was entitled to <i>equitable</i> relief. See <i>id.,</i> at 237-238, 27 S.Ct. 618.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the present case, there was no question in <i>Tennessee Copper</i> about Article III injury. See <i>id.,</i> at 238-239, 27 S.Ct. 618. There was certainly no suggestion that the State could show standing where the private parties could not; there was no dispute, after all, that the private landowners had \"an action at law.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 238, 27 S.Ct. 618. <i>Tennessee Copper</i> has since stood for nothing more than a State's right, in an original jurisdiction action, to sue in a representative capacity as <i>parens patriae.</i> See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Maryland v. Louisiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110488\"><a href=\"/opinion/110488/maryland-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 737, 101 S.Ct. 2114, 68 L.Ed.2d 576 (1981). Nothing about a State's ability to sue in that capacity dilutes the bedrock requirement of showing injury, causation, and redressability to satisfy Article III.</p>\n<p>A claim of <i>parens patriae</i> standing is distinct from an allegation of direct injury. See <i>Wyoming v. Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112681\"><a href=\"/opinion/112681/wyoming-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span>, 448-449, 451, 112 S.Ct. 789, 117 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992). Far from being a substitute for Article III injury, <i>parens patriae</i> actions raise an additional hurdle for a state litigant: the articulation of a \"quasi-sovereign interest\" \"<i>apart</i> from the interests of particular private parties.\" <i>Alfred L. Snapp &amp; Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110789\"><a href=\"/opinion/110789/alfred-l-snapp-son-inc-v-puerto-rico-ex-rel-barez/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 607, 102 S.Ct. 3260, 73 L.Ed.2d 995 (1982) (emphasis added) (cited <i>ante,</i> at 1454). Just as an association suing on behalf of its members must show not only that it represents the members but that at least one satisfies Article III requirements, so too a State asserting quasi-sovereign interests as <i>parens patriae</i> must still show that its citizens satisfy Article III. Focusing on Massachusetts's interests as quasi-sovereign makes the required showing here harder, not easier. The Court, in effect, takes what has always been regarded as a <i>necessary</i> condition for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1466</span> <i>parens patriae</i> standing\u0097a quasi-sovereign interest\u0097and converts it into a <i>sufficient</i> showing for purposes of Article III.</p>\n<p>What is more, the Court's reasoning falters on its own terms. The Court asserts that Massachusetts is entitled to \"special solicitude\" due to its \"quasi-sovereign interests,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1455, but then applies our Article III standing test to the asserted injury of the State's loss of coastal property. See <i>ante,</i> at 1456 (concluding that Massachusetts \"has alleged a particularized injury <i>in its capacity as a landowner</i>\" (emphasis added)). In the context of <i>parens patriae</i> standing, however, we have characterized state ownership of land as a \"nonsovereign interes[t]\" because a State \"is likely to have the same interests as other similarly situated proprietors.\" <i>Alfred L. Snapp &amp; Son, supra,</i> at 601, 102 S.Ct. 3260.</p>\n<p>On top of everything else, the Court overlooks the fact that our cases cast significant doubt on a State's standing to assert a quasi-sovereign interest\u0097as opposed to a direct injury\u0097against the Federal Government. As a general rule, we have held that while a State might assert a quasi-sovereign right as <i>parens patriae</i> \"for the protection of its citizens, it is no part of its duty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the Federal Government. In that field it is the United States, and not the State, which represents them.\" <i>Massachusetts v.

Snapp &amp; Son, supra,</i> at 610, n. 16, 102 S.Ct. 3260.</p>\n<p>All of this presumably explains why petitioners never cited <i>Tennessee Copper</i> in their briefs before this Court or the D.C. Circuit. It presumably explains why not one of the legion of <i>amici</i> supporting petitioners ever cited the case. And it presumably explains why not one of the three judges writing below ever cited the case either. Given that one purpose of the standing requirement is \"`to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 1452-1453 (quoting <i>Baker v. Carr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106366\"><a href=\"/opinion/106366/baker-v-carr/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962)), it is ironic that the Court today adopts a new theory of Article III standing for States without the benefit of briefing or argument on the point.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>It is not at all clear how the Court's \"special solicitude\" for Massachusetts plays out in the standing analysis, except as an implicit concession that petitioners cannot establish standing on traditional terms. But the status of Massachusetts as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1467</span> a State cannot compensate for petitioners' failure to demonstrate injury in fact, causation, and redressability.</p>\n<p>When the Court actually applies the three-part test, it focuses, as did the dissent below, see <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span>, 64 (C.A.D.C.2005) (opinion of Tatel, J.), on the State's asserted loss of coastal land as the injury in fact. If petitioners rely on loss of land as the Article III injury, however, they must ground the rest of the standing analysis in that specific injury. That alleged injury must be \"concrete and particularized,\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S., at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, and \"distinct and palpable,\" <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S., at 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315 (internal quotation marks omitted). Central to this concept of \"particularized\" injury is the requirement that a plaintiff be affected in a \"personal and individual way,\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S., at 560, n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 2130, and seek relief that \"directly and tangibly benefits him\" in a manner distinct from its impact on \"the public at large,\" <i>id.,</i> at 573-574, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Without \"particularized injury, there can be no confidence of `a real need to exercise the power of judicial review' or that relief can be framed `no broader than required by the precise facts to which the court's ruling would be applied.'\" <i>Warth v. Seldin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109301\"><a href=\"/opinion/109301/warth-v-seldin/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 508, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (quoting <i>Schlesinger v.

Global warming is a phenomenon \"harmful to humanity at large,\" 415 F.3d, at 60 (Sentelle, J., dissenting in part and concurring in judgment), and the redress petitioners seek is focused no more on them than on the public generally\u0097it is literally to change the atmosphere around the world.</p>\n<p>If petitioners' particularized injury is loss of coastal land, it is also that injury that must be \"actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted), \"real and immediate,\" <i>Los Angeles v.

But none of petitioners' declarations supports that connection. One declaration states that \"a rise in sea level due to climate change is occurring on the coast of Massachusetts, in the metropolitan Boston area,\" but there is no elaboration. Petitioners' Standing Appendix in No. 03-1361, etc. (CADC), p. 196 (Stdg.App.). And the declarant goes on to identify a \"significan[t]\" <i>non</i>-global-warming cause of Boston's rising sea level: land subsidence. <i>Id.,</i> at 197; see also <i>id.,</i> at 216. Thus, aside from a single conclusory statement, there is nothing in petitioners' 43 standing declarations and accompanying exhibits to support an inference of actual loss of Massachusetts coastal land from 20th century global sea level increases. It is pure conjecture.</p>\n<p>The Court's attempts to identify \"imminent\" or \"certainly impending\" loss of Massachusetts coastal land fares no better. See <i>ante,</i> at 1456-1457. One of petitioners' declarants predicts global warming will cause sea level to rise by 20 to 70 centimeters <i>by the year 2100.</i> Stdg.App. 216. Another uses a computer modeling <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1468</span> program to map the Commonwealth's coastal land and its current elevation, and calculates that the high-end estimate of sea level rise would result in the loss of significant state-owned coastal land. <i>Id.,</i> at 179. But the computer modeling program has a conceded average error of about 30 centimeters and a maximum observed error of 70 centimeters. <i>Id.,</i> at 177-178. As an initial matter, if it is possible that the model underrepresents the elevation of coastal land to an extent equal to or in excess of the projected sea level rise, it is difficult to put much stock in the predicted loss of land. But even placing that problem to the side, accepting a century-long time horizon and a series of compounded estimates renders requirements of imminence and immediacy utterly toothless. See <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 565, n. 2, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (while the concept of \"`imminence'\" in standing doctrine is \"somewhat elastic,\" it can be \"stretched beyond the breaking point\"). \"Allegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Art. III. A threatened injury must be <i>certainly impending</i> to constitute injury in fact.\" <i>Whitmore, supra,</i> at 158, 110 S.Ct. 1717. (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Petitioners' reliance on Massachusetts's loss of coastal land as their injury in fact for standing purposes creates insurmountable problems for them with respect to causation and redressability. To establish standing, petitioners must show a causal connection between that specific injury and the lack of new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards, and that the promulgation of such standards would likely redress that injury. As is often the case, the questions of causation and redressability overlap. See <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S., at 753, n. 19, 104 S.Ct. 3315 (observing that the two requirements were \"initially articulated by this Court as two facets of a single causation requirement\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). And importantly, when a party is challenging the Government's allegedly unlawful regulation, or lack of regulation, of a third party, satisfying the causation and redressability requirements becomes \"substantially more difficult.\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 562, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Warth, supra,</i> at 504-505, 95 S.Ct. 2197.</p>\n<p>Petitioners view the relationship between their injuries and EPA's failure to promulgate new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards as simple and direct: Domestic motor vehicles emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and therefore also to petitioners' alleged injuries. Without the new vehicle standards, greenhouse gas emissions\u0097and therefore global warming and its attendant harms\u0097have been higher than they otherwise would have been; once EPA changes course, the trend will be reversed.</p>\n<p>The Court ignores the complexities of global warming, and does so by now disregarding the \"particularized\" injury it relied on in step one, and using the dire nature of global warming itself as a bootstrap for finding causation and redressability. First, it is important to recognize the extent of the emissions at issue here. Because local greenhouse gas emissions disperse throughout the atmosphere and remain there for anywhere from 50 to 200 years, it is global emissions data that are relevant. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-73. According to one of petitioners' declarations, domestic motor vehicles contribute about 6 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions and 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Stdg.App. 232. The amount of global emissions at issue here is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1469</span> smaller still; \u00a7 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act covers only <i>new</i> motor vehicles and <i>new</i> motor vehicle engines, so petitioners' desired emission standards might reduce only a fraction of 4 percent of global emissions.</p>\n<p>This gets us only to the relevant greenhouse gas emissions; linking them to global warming and ultimately to petitioners' alleged injuries next requires consideration of further complexities. As EPA explained in its denial of petitioners' request for rulemaking,</p>\n<blockquote>\"predicting future climate change necessarily involves a complex web of economic and physical factors including: our ability to predict future global anthropogenic emissions of [greenhouse gases] and aerosols; the fate of these emissions once they enter the atmosphere (e.g., what percentage are absorbed by vegetation or are taken up by the oceans); the impact of those emissions that remain in the atmosphere on the radiative properties of the atmosphere; changes in critically important climate feedbacks (e.g., changes in cloud cover and ocean circulation); changes in temperature characteristics (e.g., average temperatures, shifts in daytime and evening temperatures); changes in other climatic parameters (e.g., shifts in precipitation, storms); and ultimately the impact of such changes on human health and welfare (e.g., increases or decreases in agricultural productivity, human health impacts).\" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-83 through A-84.</blockquote>\n<p>Petitioners are never able to trace their alleged injuries back through this complex web to the fractional amount of global emissions that might have been limited with EPA standards. In light of the bit-part domestic new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions have played in what petitioners describe as a 150-year global phenomenon, and the myriad additional factors bearing on petitioners' alleged injury\u0097the loss of Massachusetts coastal land\u0097the connection is far too speculative to establish causation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Redressability is even more problematic. To the tenuous link between petitioners' alleged injury and the indeterminate fractional domestic emissions at issue here, add the fact that petitioners cannot meaningfully predict what will come of the 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions that originate outside the United States. As the Court acknowledges, \"developing countries such as China and India are poised to increase greenhouse gas emissions substantially over the next century,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1458, so the domestic emissions at issue here may become an increasingly marginal portion of global emissions, and any decreases produced by petitioners' desired standards are likely to be overwhelmed many times over by emissions increases elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p>Petitioners offer declarations attempting to address this uncertainty, contending that \"[i]f the U.S. takes steps to reduce motor vehicle emissions, other countries are very likely to take similar actions regarding their own motor vehicles using technology developed in response to the U.S. program.\" Stdg.App. 220; see also <i>id.,</i> at 311-312. In other words, do not worry that other countries will contribute far more to global warming than will U.S. automobile emissions; someone is bound to invent something, and places like the People's Republic of China or India will surely require use of the new technology, regardless of cost. The Court previously has explained that when the existence of an element of standing \"depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and whose <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1470</span> exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to control or to predict,\" a party must present facts supporting an assertion that the actor will proceed in such a manner. <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S., at 562, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (quoting <i>ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112268\"><a href=\"/opinion/112268/asarco-inc-v-kadish/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span>, 615, 109 S.Ct. 2037, 104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989) (opinion of KENNEDY, J.); internal quotation marks omitted). The declarations' conclusory (not to say fanciful) statements do not even come close.</p>\n<p>No matter, the Court reasons, because <i>any</i> decrease in domestic emissions will \"slow the pace of global emissions increases, no matter what happens elsewhere.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1458. Every little bit helps, so Massachusetts can sue over any little bit.</p>\n<p>The Court's sleight-of-hand is in failing to link up the different elements of the three-part standing test. What must be <i>likely</i> to be redressed is the particular injury in fact. The injury the Court looks to is the asserted loss of land. The Court contends that regulating domestic motor vehicle emissions will reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, <i>and therefore</i> redress Massachusetts's injury. But even if regulation <i>does</i> reduce emissions\u0097to some indeterminate degree, given events elsewhere in the world\u0097the Court never explains why that makes it <i>likely</i> that the injury in fact\u0097the loss of land\u0097will be redressed. Schoolchildren know that a kingdom might be lost \"all for the want of a horseshoe nail,\" but \"likely\" redressability is a different matter. The realities make it pure conjecture to suppose that EPA regulation of new automobile emissions will <i>likely</i> prevent the loss of Massachusetts coastal land.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Petitioners' difficulty in demonstrating causation and redressability is not surprising given the evident mismatch between the source of their alleged injury\u0097catastrophic global warming\u0097and the narrow subject matter of the Clean Air Act provision at issue in this suit. The mismatch suggests that petitioners' true goal for this litigation may be more symbolic than anything else. The constitutional role of the courts, however, is to decide concrete cases\u0097not to serve as a convenient forum for policy debates. See <i>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (\"[Standing] tends to assure that the legal questions presented to the court will be resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action\").</p>\n<p>When dealing with legal doctrine phrased in terms of what is \"fairly\" traceable or \"likely\" to be redressed, it is perhaps not surprising that the matter is subject to some debate. But in considering how loosely or rigorously to define those adverbs, it is vital to keep in mind the purpose of the inquiry. The limitation of the judicial power to cases and controversies \"is crucial in maintaining the tripartite allocation of power set forth in the Constitution.\" <i>DaimlerChrysler,</i> 547 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 1860-1861 (internal quotation marks omitted). In my view, the Court today\u0097addressing Article III's \"core component of standing,\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130\u0097fails to take this limitation seriously.</p>\n<p>To be fair, it is not the first time the Court has done so. Today's decision recalls the previous high-water mark of diluted standing requirements, <i>United States v.

III standing\" and \"surely went to the very outer limit of the law\"\u0097until today. <i>Whitmore,</i> 495 U.S., at 158-159, 110 S.Ct. 1717; see also <i>Lujan v.

In <i>SCRAP,</i> the Court based an environmental group's standing to challenge a railroad freight rate surcharge on the group's allegation that increases in railroad rates would cause an increase in the use of nonrecyclable goods, resulting in the increased need for natural resources to produce such goods. According to the group, some of these resources might be taken from the Washington area, resulting in increased refuse that might find its way into area parks, harming the group's members. 412 U.S., at 688, 93 S.Ct. 2405.</p>\n<p>Over time, <i>SCRAP</i> became emblematic not of the looseness of Article III standing requirements, but of how utterly manipulable they are if not taken seriously as a matter of judicial self-restraint. <i>SCRAP</i> made standing seem a lawyer's game, rather than a fundamental limitation ensuring that courts function as courts and not intrude on the politically accountable branches. Today's decision is <i>SCRAP</i> for a new generation.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Perhaps the Court recognizes as much. How else to explain its need to devise a new doctrine of state standing to support its result? The good news is that the Court's \"special solicitude\" for Massachusetts limits the future applicability of the diluted standing requirements applied in this case. The bad news is that the Court's self-professed relaxation of those Article III requirements has caused us to transgress \"the proper\u0097and properly limited\u0097role of the courts in a democratic society.\" <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S., at 750, 104 S.Ct. 3315 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I join THE CHIEF JUSTICE's opinion in full, and would hold that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide this case because petitioners lack standing. The Court having decided otherwise, it is appropriate for me to note my dissent on the merits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The provision of law at the heart of this case is \u00a7 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), which provides that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \"shall by regulation prescribe. . . standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which <i>in his</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1472</span> <i>judgment</i> cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1) (emphasis added). As the Court recognizes, the statute \"condition[s] the exercise of EPA's authority on its formation of a `judgment.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1462. There is no dispute that the Administrator has made no such judgment in this case. See <i>ante,</i> at 1463 (\"We need not and do not reach the question whether on remand EPA must make an endangerment finding\"); 68 Fed. 52929 (2003) (\"[N]o Administrator has made a finding under any of the CAA's regulatory provisions that CO2 meets the applicable statutory criteria for regulation\").</p>\n<p>The question thus arises: Does anything <i>require</i> the Administrator to make a \"judgment\" whenever a petition for rulemaking is filed? Without citation of the statute or any other authority, the Court says yes. Why is that so? When Congress wishes to make private action force an agency's hand, it knows how to do so. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Brock v. Pierce County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111668\"><a href=\"/opinion/111668/brock-v-pierce-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, 254-255, 106 S.Ct. 1834, 90 L.Ed.2d 248 (1986) (discussing the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), 92 Stat. 1926, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(b) (1976 ed., Supp. V), which \"provide[d] that the Secretary of Labor `shall' issue a final determination as to the misuse of CETA funds by a grant recipient within 120 days after receiving a complaint alleging such misuse\"). Where does the CAA say that the EPA Administrator is required to come to a decision on this question whenever a rulemaking petition is filed? The Court points to no such provision because none exists.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Court invents a multiple-choice question that the EPA Administrator must answer when a petition for rulemaking is filed. The Administrator must exercise his judgment in one of three ways: (a) by concluding that the pollutant <i>does</i> cause, or contribute to, air pollution that endangers public welfare (in which case EPA is required to regulate); (b) by concluding that the pollutant <i>does not</i> cause, or contribute to, air pollution that endangers public welfare (in which case EPA is <i>not</i> required to regulate); or (c) by \"provid[ing] some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether\" greenhouse gases endanger public welfare, <i>ante,</i> at 1462, (in which case EPA is <i>not</i> required to regulate).</p>\n<p>I am willing to assume, for the sake of argument, that the Administrator's discretion in this regard is not entirely unbounded\u0097that if he has no reasonable basis for deferring judgment he must grasp the nettle at once. The Court, however, with no basis in text or precedent, rejects all of EPA's stated \"policy judgments\" as not \"amount[ing] to a reasoned justification,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1463, effectively narrowing the universe of potential reasonable bases to a single one: Judgment can be delayed <i>only</i> if the Administrator concludes that \"the scientific uncertainty is [too] profound.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Administrator is precluded from concluding <i>for other reasons</i> \"that it would. . . be better not to regulate at this time.\" <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[1]</sup> Such other reasons\u0097perfectly valid reasons\u0097were set forth in the agency's statement.</p>\n<blockquote>\"We do not believe . . . that it would be either effective or appropriate for EPA to establish [greenhouse gas] standards for motor vehicles at this time. As described in detail below, the President has laid out a comprehensive approach <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1473</span> to climate change that calls for near-term voluntary actions and incentives along with programs aimed at reducing scientific uncertainties and encouraging technological development so that the government may effectively and efficiently address the climate change issue over the long term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[E]stablishing [greenhouse gas] emission standards for U.S. motor vehicles at this time would . . . result in an inefficient, piecemeal approach to addressing the climate change issue. The U.S. motor vehicle fleet is one of many sources of [greenhouse gas] emissions both here and abroad, and different [greenhouse gas] emission sources face different technological and financial challenges in reducing emissions. A sensible regulatory scheme would require that all significant sources and sinks of [greenhouse gas] emissions be considered in deciding how best to achieve any needed emission reductions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Unilateral EPA regulation of motor vehicle [greenhouse gas] emissions could also weaken U.S. efforts to persuade developing countries to reduce the [greenhouse gas] intensity of their economies. Considering the large populations and growing economies of some developing countries, increases in their [greenhouse gas] emissions could quickly overwhelm the effects of [greenhouse gas] reduction measures in developed countries. Any potential benefit of EPA regulation could be lost to the extent other nations decided to let their emissions significantly increase in view of U.S. emissions reductions. Unavoidably, climate change raises important foreign policy issues, and it is the President's prerogative to address them.\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52929-52931 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>The Court dismisses this analysis as \"rest[ing] on reasoning divorced from the statutory text.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1462. \"While the statute does condition the exercise of EPA's authority on its formation of a `judgment,' . . . that judgment must relate to whether an air pollutant `cause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> True but irrelevant. When the Administrator <i>makes</i> a judgment whether to regulate greenhouse gases, that judgment must relate to whether they are air pollutants that \"cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1). But the statute says <i>nothing at all</i> about the reasons for which the Administrator may <i>defer</i> making a judgment\u0097the permissible reasons for deciding not to grapple with the issue at the present time. Thus, the various \"policy\" rationales, <i>ante,</i> at 1463, that the Court criticizes are not \"divorced from the statutory text,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1462, except in the sense that the statutory text is silent, as texts are often silent about permissible reasons for the exercise of agency discretion. The reasons the EPA gave are surely considerations executive agencies <i>regularly</i> take into account (and <i>ought</i> to take into account) when deciding whether to consider entering a new field: the impact such entry would have on other Executive Branch programs and on foreign policy. There is no basis in law for the Court's imposed limitation.</p>\n<p>EPA's interpretation of the discretion conferred by the statutory reference to \"its judgment\" is not only reasonable, it is the most natural reading of the text. The Court nowhere explains why this interpretation is incorrect, let alone why it is not entitled to deference under <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1474</span> <i>Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). As the Administrator acted within the law in declining to make a \"judgment\" for the policy reasons above set forth, I would uphold the decision to deny the rulemaking petition on that ground alone.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Even on the Court's own terms, however, the same conclusion follows. As mentioned above, the Court gives EPA the option of determining that the science is too uncertain to allow it to form a \"judgment\" as to whether greenhouse gases endanger public welfare. Attached to this option (on what basis is unclear) is an essay requirement: \"If,\" the Court says, \"the scientific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment as to whether greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, EPA must say so.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1463. But EPA <i>has</i> said precisely that\u0097and at great length, based on information contained in a 2001 report by the National Research Council (NRC) entitled Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\"As the NRC noted in its report, concentrations of [greenhouse gases (GHGs)] are increasing in the atmosphere as a result of human activities (pp. 9-12). It also noted that `[a] diverse array of evidence points to a warming of global surface air temperatures' (p. 16). The report goes on to state, however, that `[b]ecause of the large and still uncertain level of natural variability inherent in the climate record and the uncertainties in the time histories of the various forcing agents (and particularly aerosols), a [causal] linkage between the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the observed climate changes during the 20th century cannot be unequivocally established. The fact that the magnitude of the observed warming is large in comparison to natural variability as simulated in climate models is suggestive of such a linkage, but it does not constitute proof of one because the model simulations could be deficient in natural variability on the decadal to century time scale' (p. 17).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The NRC also observed that `there is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how the climate system varies naturally and reacts to emissions of [GHGs] and aerosols' (p. 1). As a result of that uncertainty, the NRC cautioned that `current estimate of the magnitude of future warming should be regarded as tentative and subject to future adjustments (either upward or downward).' <i>Id.</i> It further advised that `[r]educing the wide range of uncertainty inherent in current model predictions of global climate change will require major advances in understanding and modeling of both (1) the factors that determine atmospheric concentrations of [GHGs] and aerosols and (2) the so-called \"feedbacks\" that determine the sensitivity of the climate system to a prescribed increase in [GHGs].' <i>Id.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The science of climate change is extraordinarily complex and still evolving. Although there have been substantial advances in climate change science, there continue to be important uncertainties in our understanding of the factors that may affect future climate change and how it should be addressed. As the NRC explained, predicting future climate change necessarily involves a complex web of economic and physical factors including: Our ability to predict future global anthropogenic emissions of GHGs and aerosols; the fate of these emissions once they enter the atmosphere (<i>e.g.,</i> what percentage are absorbed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1475</span> by vegetation or are taken up by the oceans); the impact of those emissions that remain in the atmosphere on the radiative properties of the atmosphere; changes in critically important climate feedbacks (<i>e.g.,</i> changes in cloud cover and ocean circulation); changes in temperature characteristics (<i>e.g.,</i> average temperatures, shifts in daytime and evening temperatures); changes in other climatic parameters (<i>e.g.,</i> shifts in precipitation, storms); and ultimately the impact of such changes on human health and welfare (<i>e.g.,</i> increases or decreases in agricultural productivity, human health impacts). The NRC noted, in particular, that `[t]he understanding of the relationships between weather/climate and human health is in its infancy and therefore the health consequences of climate change are poorly understood' (p. 20). Substantial scientific uncertainties limit our ability to assess each of these factors and to separate out those changes resulting from natural variability from those that are directly the result of increases in anthropogenic GHGs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Reducing the wide range of uncertainty inherent in current model predictions will require major advances in understanding and modeling of the factors that determine atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and the processes that determine the sensitivity of the climate system.\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52930.</blockquote>\n<p>I simply cannot conceive of what else the Court would like EPA to say.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Even before reaching its discussion of the word \"judgment,\" the Court makes another significant error when it concludes that \"\u00a7 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act <i>authorizes</i> EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a `judgment' that such emissions contribute to climate change.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1459 (emphasis added). For such authorization, the Court relies on what it calls \"the Clean Air Act's capacious definition of `air pollutant.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1460.</p>\n<p>\"Air pollutant\" is defined by the Act as \"any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical,. . . substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(g). The Court is correct that \"[c]arbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1462, fit within the second half of that definition: They are \"physical, chemical,. . . substance[s] or matter which [are] emitted into or otherwise ente[r] the ambient air.\" But the Court mistakenly believes this to be the end of the analysis. In order to be an \"air pollutant\" under the Act's definition, the \"substance or matter [being] emitted into . . . the ambient air\" must also meet the <i>first</i> half of the definition\u0097namely, it must be an \"air pollution agent or combination of such agents.\" The Court simply pretends this half of the definition does not exist.</p>\n<p>The Court's analysis faithfully follows the argument advanced by petitioners, which focuses on the word \"including\" in the statutory definition of \"air pollutant.\" See Brief for Petitioners 13-14. As that argument goes, anything that <i>follows</i> the word \"including\" must necessarily be a subset of whatever <i>precedes</i> it. Thus, if greenhouse gases qualify under the phrase following the word \"including,\" they must qualify under the phrase preceding it. Since greenhouse gases come within the capacious phrase \"any physical, chemical,. . . substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1476</span> they must also be \"air pollution agent[s] or combination[s] of such agents,\" and therefore meet the definition of \"air pollutant[s].\"</p>\n<p>That is certainly one possible interpretation of the statutory definition. The word \"including\" can indeed indicate that what follows will be an \"illustrative\" sampling of the general category that precedes the word. <i>Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103553\"><a href=\"/opinion/103553/fed-land-bank-v-bismarck-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 100, 62 S.Ct. 1, 86 L.Ed. 65 (1941). Often, however, the examples standing alone are broader than the general category, and must be viewed as limited in light of that category. The Government provides a helpful (and unanswered) example: \"The phrase `any American automobile, including any truck or minivan,' would not naturally be construed to encompass a foreign-manufactured [truck or] minivan.\" Brief for Federal Respondent 34. The general principle enunciated\u0097that the speaker is talking about <i>American</i> automobiles\u0097carries forward to the illustrative examples (trucks and minivans), and limits them accordingly, even though in isolation they are broader. Congress often uses the word \"including\" in this manner. In 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782(a), for example, it refers to \"a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal, including criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation.\" Certainly this provision would not encompass criminal investigations underway in a <i>domestic</i> tribunal. See also, <i>e.g.,</i> 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 54(a) (\"The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall, at the request of a Member of the House of Representatives, furnish to the Member, for official use only, one set of a privately published annotated version of the United States Code, including supplements and pocket parts\"); 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2304(b)(1) (\"the relevant findings of appropriate international organizations, including nongovernmental organizations\").</p>\n<p>In short, the word \"including\" does not require the Court's (or the petitioners') result. It is perfectly reasonable to view the definition of \"air pollutant\" in its entirety: An air pollutant <i>can</i> be \"any physical, chemical, . . . substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air,\" but only if it retains the general characteristic of being an \"air pollution agent or combination of such agents.\" This is precisely the conclusion EPA reached: \"[A] substance does not meet the CAA definition of `air pollutant' simply because it is a `physical, chemical,. . . substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.' It must also be an `air pollution agent.'\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52929, n. 3. See also <i>id.,</i> at 52928 (\"The root of the definition indicates that for a substance to be an `air pollutant,' it must be an `agent' of `air pollution'\"). Once again, in the face of textual ambiguity, the Court's application of <i>Chevron</i> deference to EPA's interpretation of the word \"including\" is nowhere to be found.<sup>[2]</sup> Evidently, the Court defers only to those reasonable interpretations that it favors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Using (as we ought to) EPA's interpretation of the definition of \"air pollutant,\" we must next determine whether greenhouse gases are \"agent[s]\" of \"air pollution.\" If so, the statute would authorize <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1477</span> regulation; if not, EPA would lack authority.</p>\n<p>Unlike \"air pollutants,\" the term \"air pollution\" is not itself defined by the CAA; thus, once again we must accept EPA's interpretation of that ambiguous term, provided its interpretation is a \"permissible construction of the statute.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S., at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. In this case, the petition for rulemaking asked EPA for \"regulation of [greenhouse gas] emissions from motor vehicles to reduce the risk of global climate change.\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52925. Thus, in deciding whether it had authority to regulate, EPA had to determine whether the concentration of greenhouse gases assertedly responsible for \"global climate change\" qualifies as \"air pollution.\" EPA began with the commonsense observation that the \"[p]roblems associated with atmospheric concentrations of CO2,\" <i>id.,</i> at 52927, bear little resemblance to what would naturally be termed \"air pollution\":</p>\n<blockquote>\"EPA's prior use of the CAA's general regulatory provisions provides an important context. Since the inception of the Act, EPA has used these provisions to address air pollution problems that occur primarily at ground level or near the surface of the earth. For example, national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) established under CAA section 109 address concentrations of substances in the ambient air and the related public health and welfare problems. This has meant setting NAAQS for concentrations of ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter and other substances in the air near the surface of the earth, not higher in the atmosphere. . . . CO2, by contrast, is fairly consistent in concentration throughout the world's atmosphere up to approximately the lower stratosphere.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 52926-52927.</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, regulating the buildup of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, which is alleged to be causing global climate change, is not akin to regulating the concentration of some substance that is <i>polluting</i> the <i>air.</i></p>\n<p>We need look no further than the dictionary for confirmation that this interpretation of \"air pollution\" is eminently reasonable. The definition of \"pollute,\" of course, is \"[t]o make or render impure or unclean.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 1910 (2d ed.1949). And the first three definitions of \"air\" are as follows: (1) \"[t]he invisible, odorless, and tasteless mixture of gases which surrounds the earth\"; (2) \"[t]he body of the earth's atmosphere; esp., the part of it near the earth, as distinguished from the upper rarefied part\"; (3) \"[a] portion of air or of the air considered with respect to physical characteristics or as affecting the senses.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 54. EPA's conception of \"air pollution\"\u0097focusing on impurities in the \"ambient air\" \"at ground level or near the surface of the earth\"\u0097is perfectly consistent with the natural meaning of that term.</p>\n<p>In the end, EPA concluded that since \"CAA authorization to regulate is generally based on a finding that an air pollutant causes or contributes to air pollution,\" 68 Fed.Reg. 52928, the concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases allegedly affecting the global climate are beyond the scope of CAA's authorization to regulate. \"[T]he term `air pollution' as used in the regulatory provisions cannot be interpreted to encompass global climate change.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Once again, the Court utterly fails to explain why this interpretation is incorrect, let alone so unreasonable as to be unworthy of <i>Chevron</i> deference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Court's alarm over global warming may or may not be justified, but it ought <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1478</span> not distort the outcome of this litigation. This is a straightforward administrative-law case, in which Congress has passed a malleable statute giving broad discretion, not to us but to an executive agency. No matter how important the underlying policy issues at stake, this Court has no business substituting its own desired outcome for the reasoned judgment of the responsible agency.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Pet. for Cert. 22.</p>\n<p>[2]  California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.</p>\n<p>[3]  District of Columbia, American Samoa, New York City, and Baltimore.</p>\n<p>[4]  Center for Biological Diversity, Center for Food Safety, Conservation Law Foundation, Environmental Advocates, Environmental Defense, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, International Center for Technology Assessment, National Environmental Trust, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, and U.S. Public Interest Research Group.</p>\n<p>[5]  Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah.</p>\n<p>[6]  Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, National Automobile Dealers Association, Engine Manufacturers Association, Truck Manufacturers Association, CO2 Litigation Group, and Utility Air Regulatory Group.</p>\n<p>[7]  The 1970 version of \u00a7 202(a)(1) used the phrase \"which endangers the public health or welfare\" rather than the more-protective \"which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" See \u00a7 6(a) of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1690.

Immediately after discussing the \"particular concern\" that climate change might cause an \"increase in the wind speed and peak rate of precipitation of major tropical cyclones (i.e., hurricanes and typhoons),\" MacCracken noted that \"[s]oil compaction, sea level rise and recurrent storms are destroying approximately 20-30 square miles of Louisiana wetlands each year. These wetlands serve as a `shock absorber' for storm surges that could inundate New Orleans, significantly enhancing the risk to a major urban population.\" \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, Stdg.App. 217.</p>\n<p>[19]  \"For example, the [Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation] owns, operates and maintains approximately 53 coastal state parks, beaches, reservations, and wildlife sanctuaries. [It] also owns, operates and maintains sporting and recreational facilities in coastal areas, including numerous pools, skating rinks, playgrounds, playing fields, former coastal fortifications, public stages, museums, bike trails, tennis courts, boathouses and boat ramps and landings. Associated with these coastal properties and facilities is a significant amount of infrastructure, which the Commonwealth also owns, operates and maintains, including roads, parkways, stormwater pump stations, pier[s], sea wal[l] revetments and dams.\" Hoogeboom Decl. \u00b6 4, at 171.</p>\n<p>[20]  See also <i>id.,</i> at 179 (declaration of Christian Jacqz) (discussing possible loss of roughly 14 acres of land per miles of coastline by 2100); Kirshen Decl. \u00b6 10, at 198 (alleging that \"[w]hen such a rise in sea level occurs, a 10-year flood will have the magnitude of the present 100-year flood and a 100-year flood will have the magnitude of the present 500-year flood\").</p>\n<p>[21]  In dissent, THE CHIEF JUSTICE dismisses petitioners' submissions as \"conclusory,\" presumably because they do not quantify Massachusetts' land loss with the exactitude he would prefer. <i>Post,</i> at 1467-1468. He therefore asserts that the Commonwealth's injury is \"conjectur[al].\" See <i>ibid.</i> Yet the likelihood that Massachusetts' coastline will recede has nothing to do with whether petitioners have determined the precise metes and bounds of their soon-to-be-flooded land. Petitioners maintain that the seas are rising and will continue to rise, and have alleged that such a rise will lead to the loss of Massachusetts' sovereign territory. No one, save perhaps the dissenters, disputes those allegations.

He does not, however, disavow this portion of Justice Stewart's opinion for the Court:\n</p>\n<p>\"Unlike the specific and geographically limited federal action of which the petitioner complained in <i>Sierra Club</i> [v. <i>Morton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108502\"><a href=\"/opinion/108502/sierra-club-v-morton/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972)], the challenged agency action in this case is applicable to substantially all of the Nation's railroads, and thus allegedly has an adverse environmental impact on all the natural resources of the country. Rather than a limited group of persons who used a picturesque valley in California, all persons who utilize the scenic resources of the country, and indeed all who breathe its air, could claim harm similar to that alleged by the environmental groups here. But we have already made it clear that standing is not to be denied simply because many people suffer the same injury. Indeed some of the cases on which we relied in <i>Sierra Club</i> demonstrated the patent fact that persons across the Nation could be adversely affected by major governmental actions. <i>To deny standing to persons who are in fact injured simply because many others are also injured, would mean that the most injurious and widespread Government actions could be questioned by nobody.</i> We cannot accept that conclusion.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citations omitted and emphasis added).</p>\n<p>It is moreover quite wrong to analogize the legal claim advanced by Massachusetts and the other public and private entities who challenge EPA's parsimonious construction of the Clean Air Act to a mere \"lawyer's game.\" See <i>post,</i> at 1471.</p>\n<p>[25]  See <i>Department of Housing and Urban Development v.

Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). See <i>post,</i> at 1469-1470. EPA's distinction, however, finds no support in the text of the statute, which uses the phrase \"the ambient air\" without distinguishing between atmospheric layers. Moreover, it is a plainly unreasonable reading of a sweeping statutory provision designed to capture \"<i>any</i> physical, chemical ... substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(g). Justice SCALIA does not (and cannot) explain why Congress would define \"air pollutant\" so carefully and so broadly, yet confer on EPA the authority to narrow that definition whenever expedient by asserting that a particular substance is not an \"agent.\" At any rate, no party to this dispute contests that greenhouse gases both \"ente[r] the ambient air\" and tend to warm the atmosphere. They are therefore unquestionably \"agent[s]\" of air pollution.</p>\n<p>[27]  See <i>United States v.

The point is that nothing in our cases (or Hart &amp; Wechsler) suggests that the prudential requirements for <i>parens patriae</i> standing, see <i>Republic of Venezuela v. Philip Morris Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777320\"><a href=\"/opinion/777320/republic-of-venezuela-v-philip-morris-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 199, n. (CADC 2002) (observing that \"<i>parens patriae</i> is merely a species of prudential standing\" (internal quotation marks omitted)), can somehow substitute for, or alter the content of, the \"irreducible constitutional minimum\" requirements of injury in fact, causation, and redressability under Article III. <i>Lujan v.

As the caption makes clear enough, the fact that a State may assert rights under a federal statute as <i>parens patriae</i> in no way refutes our clear ruling that \"[a] State does not have standing as <i>parens patriae</i> to bring an action against the Federal Government.\" <i>Alfred L.

See <i>ante,</i> at 1458-1459, n. 24. Rather, it is the <i>attenuated</i> nature of the injury there, and here, that is so troubling. Even in <i>SCRAP,</i> the Court noted that what was required was \"something more than an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable,\" 412 U.S., at 688, 93 S.Ct. 2405, and we have since understood the allegation there to have been \"that the string of occurrences alleged would happen <i>immediately,</i>\" <i>Whitmore v.

That is hardly the case here.\n</p>\n<p>The Court says it is \"quite wrong\" to compare petitioners' challenging \"EPA's parsimonious construction of the Clean Air Act to a mere `lawyer's game.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1458-1459, n. 24. Of course it is not the legal challenge that is merely \"an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable,\" <i>SCRAP, supra,</i> at 688, 93 S.Ct. 2405, but the assertions made in support of standing.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Court's way of putting it is, of course, not quite accurate. The issue is whether it would be better <i>to defer the decision about whether to exercise judgment.</i> This has the <i>effect</i> of deferring regulation but is quite a different determination.</p>\n<p>[2]  Not only is EPA's interpretation reasonable, it is far more plausible than the Court's alternative. As the Court correctly points out, \"all airborne compounds of whatever stripe,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1460, would qualify as \"physical, chemical, . . . substance[s] or matter which [are] emitted into or otherwise ente[r] the ambient air,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(g). It follows that <i>everything</i> airborne, from Frisbees to flatulence, qualifies as an \"air pollutant.\" This reading of the statute defies common sense.</p>\n\n</div>",
