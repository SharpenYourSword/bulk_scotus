Hufstedler, Morrison &amp; Foerster LLP, Los Angeles, CA, for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Legislature of Guam authorized Guam's Governor to issue bonds to fund the Territory's continuing obligations. Concluding that the bonds would violate the debt-limitation provision of the Organic Act of Guam, \u00a7 11, 64 Stat. 387, as amended, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423a, the attorney general<sup>[1]</sup> of Guam refused to sign contracts necessary to issue the bonds. In response, the Governor sought a declaration from the Guam Supreme Court that issuance of the bonds would not violate the Organic Act's debt limitation. The Guam Supreme Court held that \u00a7 1423a limits Guam's allowed indebtedness to 10 percent of the appraised valuation, not the assessed valuation, of taxable property in Guam. We granted certiorari to decide whether Guam's debt limitation must be calculated according to the assessed or the appraised valuation of property in Guam. We hold that it must be calculated based on the assessed valuation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 2003, Guam lacked sufficient revenues to pay its obligations. To supplement revenues, the Guam Legislature authorized the Governor to issue bonds worth approximately $400 million. See Guam <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1417</span> Pub.L. 27-019. The Governor signed the new legislation and prepared to issue the bonds. However, under Guam law, Guam's attorney general must review and approve all government contracts prior to their execution. Guam Code Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a7 22601 (1996). The attorney general concluded that issuance of the bonds would raise the Territory's debt above the level authorized by Guam's Organic Act. See 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423a (prohibiting debt \"in excess of 10 per centum of the aggregate tax valuation of the property in Guam\"). He therefore refused to approve the bond contracts.</p>\n<p>In response, the Governor sought a declaration from the Guam Supreme Court that issuance of the authorized bonds would not cause Guam's debt to exceed the debt limitation. That determination turned, in part, on the meaning of the phrase \"aggregate tax valuation\" in Guam's Organic Act. The attorney general calculated the debt limitation as 10 percent of the assessed valuation of property in Guam. But the Governor calculated the debt limitation as 10 percent of the appraised valuation. Because Guam assesses property at 35 percent of its appraised value, Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7 24102(f), the attorney general's interpretation resulted in a much lower debt limit. The Guam Supreme Court agreed with the Governor and held that 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423a sets the debt limitation at 10 percent of the appraised valuation of property in Guam.</p>\n<p>The attorney general filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See \u00a7 1424-2 (granting Ninth Circuit jurisdiction over appeals from Guam). The Court of Appeals granted the petition in October 2003. While the appeal was pending, Congress amended \u00a7 1424-2 and removed the language that vested jurisdiction in the Ninth Circuit over appeals from Guam. See \u00a7 2, 118 Stat. 2208, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1424-2 (West Supp.2006). In <i>Santos v. Guam,</i> 436 F.3d 1051 (Jan. 3, 2006), the Court of Appeals addressed the effect of the amendment on its jurisdiction. The court held that Congress had stripped its jurisdiction not only prospectively, but also for pending appeals. <i>Id.,</i> at 1054. Citing <i>Santos,</i> the Ninth Circuit dismissed the attorney general's appeal in this case on March 6, 2006. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.</p>\n<p>The attorney general then filed a petition for certiorari in this Court. By statute, certiorari petitions must be filed \"within 90 days after the entry of . . . judgment\" in a lower court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(c). The attorney general filed his petition more than 90 days after the judgment from which he appeals\u0097that of the Guam Supreme Court\u0097was entered. Accordingly, when we granted certiorari in this case, 548 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 36, 165 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2006), we directed the parties to address both the question presented by petitioner and whether the filing of a petition for certiorari or the pendency of a writ of certiorari before the Court of Appeals suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court's judgment for purposes of the 90-day period set out in \u00a7 2101(c).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Only \"a genuinely final judgment\" will trigger \u00a7 2101(c)'s 90-day period for filing a petition for certiorari in this Court. <i>Hibbs v. Winn,</i> 542 U.S. 88, 98, 124 S.Ct. 2276, 159 L.Ed.2d 172 (2004). In most cases, the 90-day period begins to run immediately upon entry of a lower court's judgment. In some cases, though, the actions of a party or a lower court suspend the finality of a judgment and thereby reset the 90-day \"clock.\" <i>Ibid.</i> For instance, the timely filing of a petition for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1418</span> rehearing with the lower court or a lower court's appropriate decision to rehear an appeal may suspend the finality of a judgment by \"rais[ing] the question whether the court will modify the judgment and alter the parties' rights.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citing <i>Missouri v. Jenkins,</i> 495 U.S. 33, 46, 110 S.Ct. 1651, 109 L.Ed.2d 31 (1990)). So long as that question remains open, \"`there is no \"judgment\" to be reviewed,'\" <i>Hibbs, supra,</i> at 98, 124 S.Ct. 2276 (quoting <i>Jenkins, supra,</i> at 46, 110 S.Ct. 1651), and \u00a7 2101(c)'s 90-day period does not run.</p>\n<p>The same reasoning applies here. In 2003, the Court of Appeals appropriately exercised discretionary jurisdiction over the attorney general's appeal. See 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1424-2. By granting the petition for certiorari, the Ninth Circuit raised the possibility that it might \"modify the judgment\" or \"alter the parties' rights.\" <i>Hibbs, supra,</i> at 98, 124 S.Ct. 2276. Thus, the Court of Appeals' grant of certiorari suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court's judgment and prevented the 90-day clock from running while the case was pending before the Court of Appeals. And until the Ninth Circuit issued its order dismissing the case, the appeal remained pending, and the finality of the judgment remained suspended.</p>\n<p>The Governor argues that the judgment was made final earlier\u0097either when Congress enacted the statute depriving the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction or when the Court of Appeals decided in <i>Santos</i> that the statute applied to pending cases. But when Congress removed the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction over appeals from Guam, it did not dismiss this appeal. Likewise, when the Ninth Circuit determined in <i>Santos,</i> that Congress had stripped its jurisdiction over pending appeals, the court did not finally determine the rights of the parties in this case. The jurisdiction-stripping statute and <i>Santos</i> may have signaled the Court of Appeals' ultimate dismissal of the appeal, but neither created a final judgment in the still-pending case. The attorney general's appeal remained pending until the Ninth Circuit issued its dismissal order. And the pendency of the appeal continued to \"raise the question whether\" any further action by the court might affect the relationship of the parties. <i>Hibbs, supra,</i> at 98, 124 S.Ct. 2276. Accordingly, we hold that the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court did not become final, for purposes of this Court's review, until the Court of Appeals issued its order dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p>We emphasize that our holding is limited to the unique procedural circumstances presented here. Specifically, our holding does not extend to improperly filed appeals or filings used as delaying tactics. See <i>Morse v. United States,</i> 270 U.S. 151, 46 S.Ct. 241, 70 L.Ed. 518 (1926) (holding that second application for leave to file motion for new trial did not suspend the finality of the lower court's judgment).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Having determined that we have jurisdiction, we turn to the merits. As always, we begin with the text of the statute. See <i>Nebraska Dept. of Revenue v. Loewenstein,</i> 513 U.S. 123, 128, 115 S.Ct. 557, 130 L.Ed.2d 470 (1994). Guam's Organic Act states that \"no public indebtedness of Guam shall be authorized or allowed in excess of 10 per centum of the aggregate tax valuation of the property in Guam.\" 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423a. The present dispute centers on the meaning of the term \"tax valuation.\" In its unmodified form, the word \"valuation\" means \"[t]he estimated worth of a thing.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1721 (4th ed.1951) (hereinafter Black's). But as the parties' competing interpretations demonstrate, there are different <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1419</span> sorts of valuations. An appraised valuation is the market value of property. See <i>id.,</i> at 129, 115 S.Ct. 557 (defining \"appraise\" as \"to fix and state the true value of a thing\"). By contrast, an \"assessed valuation\" is the \"[v]alue on each unit of which a prescribed amount must be paid as property taxes.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 149, 115 S.Ct. 557. These two kinds of valuation are related in practice because a property's assessed valuation generally equals some percentage of its appraised valuation. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7 24102(f) (defining \"value\" as \"thirty-five per cent (35%) of the appraised value\"). The assessed valuation therefore could, but typically does not, equal the market value of the property.</p>\n<p>Though it has no established definition, the term \"tax valuation\" most naturally means the value to which the tax rate is applied.<sup>[2]</sup> Were it otherwise, the modifier \"tax\" would have almost no meaning or a meaning inconsistent with ordinary usage. \"Tax valuation\" therefore means \"assessed valuation\"\u0097a term consistently defined as a valuation of property for purposes of taxation. See Black's 149; see also <i>id.,</i> at 116 (6th ed.1990) (defining \"assessed valuation\" as \"[t]he worth or value of property established by taxing authorities on the basis of which the tax rate is applied\").</p>\n<p>One would not normally refer to a property's appraised valuation as its \"tax valuation.\" Appraised valuation is simply market value. And market value may or may not relate to taxation. Usually market value becomes relevant to taxation only because a specified percentage of market value is the assessed value to which taxing authorities apply the tax rate. It would strain the text to conclude that \"tax valuation\" means a valuation a step removed from taxation.</p>\n<p>The Guam Supreme Court reached a contrary conclusion by interpreting the word \"tax\" to limit the kinds of property that qualify for inclusion in the debt-limitation calculation. But that interpretation impermissibly rearranges the statutory language. The word \"tax\" modifies \"valuation,\" not \"property.\" The phrase \"tax valuation\" therefore refers to the type of valuation to be conducted, not the object that is valued.</p>\n<p>The Guam Supreme Court also contrasted 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423a's language with explicit references to \"assessed valuation\" in the debt-limitation provision for the Virgin Islands. See \u00a7 1403 (\"aggregate assessed valuation\"). The court reasoned that, by using language in \u00a7 1423a that differed from that used in the Virgin Islands' debt-limitation provision, Congress expressed its intent to base Guam's debt limitation on something other than assessed value. We disagree. Certainly, Congress could have used the term \"assessed valuation.\" But if Congress had meant actual, market, or appraised value, it could have used any one of those terms as well. See <i>N.W. Halsey &amp; Co. v. Belle Plaine,</i> 128 Iowa 467, 104 N.W. 494 (1905) (interpreting debt-limitation provision using phrase \"actual value\"). Or it could have left the word \"valuation\" unmodified: State courts interpreting other debt-limitation provisions have understood \"valuation,\" standing alone, to mean the market or cash value of property. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Board of Education, Rich Cty. School Dist. v. Passey,</i> 122 Utah 102, 104-106, 246 P.2d 1078, 1079 (1952). At least <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1420</span> in this context, Congress' rejection of \"assessed\" tells us no more than does its rejection of \"actual\" or \"appraised.\"</p>\n<p>Our interpretation comports with most States' practice of tying the debt limitations of municipalities to assessed valuation. See 15 E. McQuillin, Law of Municipal Corporations \u00a7 41:7, p. 422 (3d ed. rev.2005) (\"Most of the constitutional and statutory provisions make the assessed value of the taxable property of the municipality the basis for ascertaining the amount of indebtedness which may be incurred. . .\"). States that depart from the majority approach use clear language to do so. See <i>id.,</i> at 424-425. (\"The standard is generally the assessed value of the property for taxation, rather than the actual value, where the two are different; but where the constitution or statute uses the term `actual value,' such value governs rather than the taxable value\" (citing <i>N.W. Halsey &amp; Co., supra</i><i>;</i> footnote omitted)). Congress has not used such language here. Indeed, as discussed earlier, only a strained reading of \"tax valuation\" would suggest a departure from the majority approach.</p>\n<p>The Governor suggests that our interpretation would result in no debt limitation at all because Guam may arbitrarily set its assessment rate above 100 percent of market value. For two reasons, we think the Governor has overstated this concern. First, most States have long based their debt limitations on assessed value without incident. Second, a strong political check exists; property-owning voters will not fail to notice if the government sets the assessment rate above market value.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Governor mistakenly argues that we owe deference to the Guam Supreme Court's interpretation of its Organic Act. It may be true that we accord deference to territorial courts over matters of purely local concern. See <i>Pernell v. Southall Realty,</i> 416 U.S. 363, 366, 94 S.Ct. 1723, 40 L.Ed.2d 198 (1974) (reviewing District of Columbia Court of Appeals' interpretation of D.C.Code provision). This case does not fit that mold, however. The debt-limitation provision protects both Guamanians and the United States from the potential consequences of territorial insolvency. Thus, this case is not a matter of purely local concern. Of course, decisions of the Supreme Court of Guam, as with other territorial courts, are instructive and are entitled to respect when they indicate how statutory issues, including the Organic Act, apply to matters of local concern. On the other hand, the Organic Act is a federal statute, which we are bound to construe according to its terms.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court and remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice GINSBURG, and Justice ALITO join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I agree that the petition for writ of certiorari was timely, and join Part II of the Court's opinion. I disagree, however, that the phrase \"tax valuation\" in the Organic Act of Guam, \u00a7 11, 64 Stat. 387, as amended, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423a, refers unambiguously to assessed value. If I could not go beyond statutory text and the sources relied upon by the Court, a coin toss would be my only way to judgment. But I look to congressional purpose, which points to appraised value as the meaning of the term, leaving me in respectful dissent.</p>\n<p>The words \"tax valuation\" can plausibly be read in either of the ways the parties <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1421</span> suggest: as synonymous with assessed value (the way the attorney general and the Court read them), because it is the assessed value to which the tax rate is immediately applied, Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7\u00a7 24102(f), 24103 (1996), or as meaning appraised value, because the appraisal is a \"valuation\" for \"tax\" purposes. The Court concedes that the term \"tax valuation\" has no canonical definition, <i>ante,</i> at 1419,<sup>[1]</sup> and says that the term \"valuation,\" standing alone, means \"`[t]he estimated worth of a thing,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 1418 (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1721 (4th ed.1951); alteration in original). Though taking property's \"estimated worth\" to be its \"tax valuation\" would make practical sense, the Court believes that construction would read the word \"tax\" out of the statute. I do not see the objection, though. Even if we say \"valuation\" means actual value, the word \"tax\" has a job to do, by specifying that the valuation in question be the valuation used for tax purposes, thus ruling out an appraisal made solely for the purpose of calculating the debt limitation, with its temptation to indulge in creative accounting when money is tight.<sup>[2]</sup> But as I said, seeing the legitimacy of this reading just leaves us with two textually plausible constructions.</p>\n<p>I see no tie-breaker in comparing Guam's debt limitation with those of other Territories. In each Territory mentioned by the parties, when Congress imposed a territorial debt limitation the assessed value was equal to the actual value of the property.<sup>[3]</sup> Thus the attorney general can stress the significance of assessed value and argue that because the debt limitation in the other Territories was based on the assessed value, the same should be true for Guam. And the Governor can argue that because the debt limitation in the other Territories was based on the actual value, that should go for Guam, too. Nor is the tie to be broken by arguing that pegging the territorial debt limit to \"tax valuation\" suggests that this Territory was meant to be treated more conservatively than a limit turning on full value; the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1422</span> suggestion is balanced by the question (without any answer proposed to us), why Congress would have wished a more restrictive (or nominally more restrictive) regime for certain Territories.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Comparing state practices is no help, either. The Court says that \"States that depart from the majority approach\" of linking debt limitations to assessed value \"use clear language to do so,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1420, but in the preceding paragraph the majority recognizes that state courts \"have understood `valuation,' standing alone, to mean the market or cash value of property,\" <i>ibid.</i> So it seems a stretch to suggest that state laws offer a clear rule that Congress may be presumed to have understood as background; better to read the state cases as products of the specific wording of their particular limitations and the state history of property taxation. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Phelps v. Minneapolis,</i> 174 Minn. 509, 511-514, 219 N.W. 872, 873-874 (1928) (relying on text of limitation, other related provisions, and history of property taxation); <i>N.W. Halsey &amp; Co. v. Belle Plaine,</i> 128 Iowa 467, 470-474, 104 N.W. 494, 495-497 (1905) (same). It almost goes without saying that neither side has cited a state case involving language and background the same as Guam's.</p>\n<p>In sum, the congressional mind does not emerge from the words \"tax valuation\" or any settled construction of that phrase. Fortunately, though, the purpose of the legislation does point to a likely reading. The statute itself makes clear that what Congress meant to provide was a practical guarantee against crushing debt on the shoulders of future generations, and insolvency with the inevitable call for a bailout by Congress. See <i>United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc.,</i> 508 U.S. 439, 455, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 124 L.Ed.2d 402 (1993) (\"`[L]ook to the [law's] . . . object and policy'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Heirs of Boisdore,</i> 8 How. 113, 122, 12 L.Ed. 1009 (1849))).</p>\n<p>The attorney general claims that her reading is a better fit with these objectives because it ties the legislature's ability to incur debt to its willingness to tax. But this is hardly so. Under the attorney general's approach (now the Court's), the Guam Legislature could double the debt limitation without increasing taxes by a single penny, simply by doubling the assessment rate and cutting the tax rate by half.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Although it is arguable that tying the debt ceiling to the assessed value may to some vague degree enhance legislative accountability by requiring action to raise the debt ceiling as debt piles up, I know of no independent suggestion that the debt limit was designed to operate as a political discouragement, not as a hard cap. It would, after all, have been strange for Congress to set a debt cap to constrain the Guam Legislature, only to leave the limiting figure subject to easy manipulation by the legislature. While I know that actual valuation can be manipulated, too, manipulation of that figure could only be done by officials acting in bad faith and subject to an obvious political or judicial challenge. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1423</span> The Court's approach, by contrast, gives the legislature a green light to subvert its own stated limit with a clear conscience.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The more practical understanding of what must have been intended is a statute tying the debt limitation to Guam's capacity to tax property. The actual, market value of property is the only economic index of Guam's ability to collect property taxes to pay its bills,<sup>[7]</sup> the only figure under consideration that is fixed in the real world, and the only figure that provides a genuine limitation. This was the figure employed or required by Congress in each of the other Territories mentioned above, see n. 3, <i>supra,</i> and I presume that its practical significance was in Congress's mind when it set the debt caps for each of them. I see no reason not to attribute the same practical assessment to Congress in this instance.</p>\n<p>I would affirm.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  At the time suit was filed, Douglas Moylan served as Guam's attorney general. Alicia Limtiaco has since been elected to the position, and she continues the case in Moylan's place.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Guam Legislature passed a law attempting to define the term \"tax valuation.\" See Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7 24102<i>(l),</i> available at http://www.guamcourts.org/justicedocs/index.html (as visited Mar. 16, 2007). But that term appears in Guam's Organic Act, which is a federal statute. As the Guam Supreme Court correctly determined, Guam's territorial legislature cannot redefine terms used in a federal statute.</p>\n<p>[1]  The phrase \"tax valuation\" had been used in debt limitations for other Territories, see ch. 34, 41 Stat. 1096 (Puerto Rico); ch. 203, 42 Stat. 599 (Philippines), but in each of those Territories the issue in this case was irrelevant because assessed and appraised values were equal. See <i>infra</i> this page and 3, and nn. 3-4.</p>\n<p>[2]  Though the Court finds the appraised value to be \"a step removed from taxation,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1419, the connection of the appraised value to the tax ultimately imposed is direct enough. It is true that the tax computation requires multiplying the appraised value by two percentages (first 35 percent to get the assessed value, Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7 24102(f) (1996), and then the 0.25 percent tax rate, \u00a7 24103) while the assessed value must only be multiplied by a single percentage. But as a practical matter, tying the tax to the assessed value ties it to the appraised value: multiplying the appraised value by 0.0875 percent (35 percent times 0.25 percent) will give you the tax every time.</p>\n<p>[3]  48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401a (\"[A]ll taxes on real property in the Virgin Islands shall be computed on the basis of the actual value of such property\"); Haw.Rev.Stat., ch. 98, \u00a7 1212 (1905), Lodging of Respondent (Doc. 2b) (\"[A]ll real property and all personal property within the Territory shall be subject to an annual tax of one per cent. upon the full cash value of the same\"); An Act to Provide Revenue for the People of Porto Rico, and for Other Purposes, Tit. I, \u00a7 8 (1901), reprinted in Acts and Resolves of the First Legislative Assembly of Porto Rico 47 (1901), Lodging of Respondent (Doc. 2a) (\"All taxable property shall be valued and assessed at its actual market value\"); A Compilation of the Acts of the Philippine Commission, Tit. 10, ch. 56, \u00a7 336(a) (1908), Lodging of Respondent (Doc. 4) (\"[T]he board shall proceed to assess the value of each separate parcel of real estate and the improvements thereon, if any, at their true value in money\").</p>\n<p>[4]  The percentage of the valuation at which the various debt limitations were set likewise provides no basis for inferring that Congress had different intentions for different Territories. When the Organic Act of Guam was passed in 1950, each of the debt limitations in the Territories mentioned in n. 3, <i>supra,</i> was also set at 10 percent of the relevant valuation. See 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403 (Virgin Islands); 42 Stat. 116 (Hawaii); ch. 34, 41 Stat. 1096 (Puerto Rico); ch. 203, 42 Stat. 599 (Philippines).</p>\n<p>[5]  The specter of mischief extends to an attempt to set the assessment rate above 100 percent. The Court contends that political or practical constraints would foreclose this maneuver. See <i>ante,</i> at 1420. After today's decision, I suppose we may find out.</p>\n<p>[6]  The attorney general's position would be strengthened if the assessment rate appeared in the Organic Act itself, for then the legislature would lack the power to change it. This state of affairs would be analogous to an assessment rate appearing in a state constitution. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Colo. Const., Art. X, \u00a7 3(1)(b); La. Const., Art. VII, \u00a7 18(B).

Argued January 8, 2007\u2014Decided March 27, 2007\nThe Guam Legislature authorized the Governor to issue bonds to fund\n  the Territory\u2019s continuing obligations, but Guam\u2019s attorney general\n  refused to sign the necessary contracts, concluding that issuance\n  would violate the debt-limitation provision of Guam\u2019s Organic Act,\n  which limits the Territory\u2019s public indebtedness to 10% of the \u201caggre\n  gate tax valuation of the property in Guam,\u201d 48 U. S. C. \u00a71423a. The\n  Governor sought a declaration from the Guam Supreme Court that\n  issuance would not violate the provision, calculating the debt limita\n  tion based on the appraised value of property in Guam. Agreeing, the\n  Supreme Court rejected the attorney general\u2019s argument to base the\n  limitation on assessed value. The Ninth Circuit granted the attorney\n  general\u2019s certiorari petition, but while the appeal was pending, Con\n  gress removed the Circuit\u2019s jurisdiction over appeals from Guam. Re\n  lying on its holding in Santos v. Guam, that Congress had stripped it\n  of jurisdiction over pending appeals, the court dismissed the appeal.\n  The attorney general then filed a petition for certiorari in this Court,\n  even though it was more than 90 days after the Guam Supreme\n  Court\u2019s judgment.\nHeld:\n    1. The Guam Supreme Court\u2019s judgment did not become final, for\n purposes of this Court\u2019s review, until the Ninth Circuit issued its or\n der dismissing the appeal. Certiorari petitions must be filed \u201cwithin\n 90 days after the entry of,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72101(c), a lower court\u2019s \u201cgenu\n inely final judgment,\u201d Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 98. In some cases,\n the actions of a party or a lower court suspend the finality of a judg\n ment by \u201crais[ing] the question whether the court will modify the\n judgment and alter the parties\u2019 rights.\u201d Ibid. By granting the peti\n tion for certiorari, the Ninth Circuit raised that possibility and thus\n2                        LIMTIACO v. CAMACHO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court\u2019s judgment. Un\n    til the Circuit issued its order dismissing the case, the appeal re\n    mained pending, and the finality of the judgment remained sus\n    pended. Contrary to the Governor\u2019s arguments, the judgment was\n    not made final either when Congress enacted the jurisdiction-\n    depriving statute or when the Ninth Circuit decided Santos. This\n    holding is limited to the unique procedural circumstances here. Pp.\n    3\u20135.\n       2. Guam\u2019s debt limitation must be calculated according to the as\n    sessed valuation of property in the Territory. The term \u201ctax valua\n    tion\u201d most naturally means the value to which the tax rate is applied.\n    It therefore means \u201cassessed valuation\u201d\u2014a term consistently defined\n    as a valuation of property for tax purposes. Appraised value is sim\n    ply market value, which may or may not relate to taxation. The\n    Guam Supreme Court\u2019s contrary interpretation\u2014that \u201ctax\u201d limits the\n    kinds of property qualifying for inclusion in the debt-limitation calcu\n    lation\u2014impermissibly rearranges the statutory language. \u201cTax\u201d\n    modifies \u201cvaluation,\u201d not \u201cproperty.\u201d Thus, \u201ctax valuation\u201d refers to\n    the type of valuation to be conducted, not the object that is valued.\n    The court also erred in reasoning that, because the Virgin Islands\u2019\n    debt-limitation provision explicitly refers to \u201cassessed value,\u201d Con\n    gress must have intended to base Guam\u2019s limitation on some other\n    value. Congress\u2019 rejection of \u201cassessed\u201d says no more than its rejec\n    tion of \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cappraised,\u201d terms it could have used had it meant\n    actual, market, or appraised value. This Court\u2019s interpretation com\n    ports with most States\u2019 practice of fixing the debt limitations of mu\n    nicipalities to assessed valuation. States use clear language when\n    departing from this approach, but Congress has not done so here.\n    The Governor\u2019s additional arguments\u2014that this interpretation would\n    result in no debt limitation at all because Guam may arbitrarily set\n    its assessment rate above 100 percent of market value, and that this\n    Court owes deference to the Guam Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of\n    the Organic Act\u2014are not persuasive.

LIMTIACO, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF \n\n     GUAM, PETITIONER v. FELIX P. CAMACHO, \n\n                GOVERNOR OF GUAM\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF GUAM\n                                 [March 27, 2007]\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Legislature of Guam authorized Guam\u2019s Governor\nto issue bonds to fund the Territory\u2019s continuing obliga\ntions. Concluding that the bonds would violate the debt-\nlimitation provision of the Organic Act of Guam, \u00a711, 64\nStat. 387, as amended, 48 U. S. C. \u00a71423a, the attorney\ngeneral1 of Guam refused to sign contracts necessary to\nissue the bonds. In response, the Governor sought a dec\nlaration from the Guam Supreme Court that issuance of\nthe bonds would not violate the Organic Act\u2019s debt limita\ntion. The Guam Supreme Court held that \u00a71423a limits\nGuam\u2019s allowed indebtedness to 10 percent of the ap\npraised valuation, not the assessed valuation, of taxable\nproperty in Guam.       We granted certiorari to decide\nwhether Guam\u2019s debt limitation must be calculated ac\ncording to the assessed or the appraised valuation of\nproperty in Guam. We hold that it must be calculated\nbased on the assessed valuation.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 At the time suit was filed, Douglas Moylan served as Guam\u2019s attor\n\nney general. Alicia Limtiaco has since been elected to the position, and\nshe continues the case in Moylan\u2019s place.\n2                  LIMTIACO v. CAMACHO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n  In 2003, Guam lacked sufficient revenues to pay its\nobligations. To supplement revenues, the Guam Legisla\nture authorized the Governor to issue bonds worth ap\nproximately $400 million. See Guam Pub. L. 27\u2013019. The\nGovernor signed the new legislation and prepared to issue\nthe bonds. However, under Guam law, Guam\u2019s attorney\ngeneral must review and approve all government contracts\nprior to their execution. Guam Code Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a722601\n(1996). The attorney general concluded that issuance of\nthe bonds would raise the Territory\u2019s debt above the level\nauthorized by Guam\u2019s Organic Act. See 48 U. S. C. \u00a71423a\n(prohibiting debt \u201cin excess of 10 per centum of the aggre\ngate tax valuation of the property in Guam\u201d). He there\nfore refused to approve the bond contracts.\n  In response, the Governor sought a declaration from the\nGuam Supreme Court that issuance of the authorized\nbonds would not cause Guam\u2019s debt to exceed the debt\nlimitation. That determination turned, in part, on the\nmeaning of the phrase \u201caggregate tax valuation\u201d in\nGuam\u2019s Organic Act. The attorney general calculated the\ndebt limitation as 10 percent of the assessed valuation of\nproperty in Guam. But the Governor calculated the debt\nlimitation as 10 percent of the appraised valuation. Be\ncause Guam assesses property at 35 percent of its ap\npraised value, Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a724102(f), the\nattorney general\u2019s interpretation resulted in a much lower\ndebt limit. The Guam Supreme Court agreed with the\nGovernor and held that 48 U. S. C. \u00a71423a sets the debt\nlimitation at 10 percent of the appraised valuation of\nproperty in Guam.\n  The attorney general filed a petition for certiorari in the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See\n\u00a71424\u20132 (granting Ninth Circuit jurisdiction over appeals\nfrom Guam). The Court of Appeals granted the petition in\nOctober 2003. While the appeal was pending, Congress\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\namended \u00a71424\u20132 and removed the language that vested\njurisdiction in the Ninth Circuit over appeals from Guam.\nSee \u00a72, 118 Stat. 2208, 48 U. S. C. A. \u00a71424\u20132 (West Supp.\n2006). In Santos v. Guam, 436 F. 3d 1051 (Jan. 3, 2006),\nthe Court of Appeals addressed the effect of the amend\nment on its jurisdiction. The court held that Congress had\nstripped its jurisdiction not only prospectively, but also for\npending appeals. Id., at 1054. Citing Santos, the Ninth\nCircuit dismissed the attorney general\u2019s appeal in this\ncase on March 6, 2006. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.\n  The attorney general then filed a petition for certiorari\nin this Court. By statute, certiorari petitions must be filed\n\u201cwithin 90 days after the entry of . . . judgment\u201d in a lower\ncourt. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72101(c). The attorney general filed his\npetition more than 90 days after the judgment from which\nhe appeals\u2014that of the Guam Supreme Court\u2014was en\ntered. Accordingly, when we granted certiorari in this\ncase, 548 U. S. ___ (2006), we directed the parties to ad\ndress both the question presented by petitioner and\nwhether the filing of a petition for certiorari or the pend\nency of a writ of certiorari before the Court of Appeals\nsuspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court\u2019s\njudgment for purposes of the 90-day period set out in\n\u00a72101(c).\n                              II\n  Only \u201ca genuinely final judgment\u201d will trigger \u00a72101(c)\u2019s\n90-day period for filing a petition for certiorari in this\nCourt. Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 98 (2004). In most\ncases, the 90-day period begins to run immediately upon\nentry of a lower court\u2019s judgment. In some cases, though,\nthe actions of a party or a lower court suspend the finality\nof a judgment and thereby reset the 90-day \u201cclock.\u201d Ibid.\nFor instance, the timely filing of a petition for rehearing\nwith the lower court or a lower court\u2019s appropriate deci\nsion to rehear an appeal may suspend the finality of a\n4                  LIMTIACO v. CAMACHO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudgment by \u201crais[ing] the question whether the court will\nmodify the judgment and alter the parties\u2019 rights.\u201d Ibid.\n(citing Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 46 (1990)). So\nlong as that question remains open, \u201c \u2018there is no \u201cjudg\nment\u201d to be reviewed,\u2019 \u201d Hibbs, supra, at 98 (quoting Jen\nkins, supra, at 46), and \u00a72101(c)\u2019s 90-day period does not\nrun.\n   The same reasoning applies here. In 2003, the Court of\nAppeals appropriately exercised discretionary jurisdiction\nover the attorney general\u2019s appeal. See 48 U. S. C. \u00a71424\u2013\n2. By granting the petition for certiorari, the Ninth Cir\ncuit raised the possibility that it might \u201cmodify the judg\nment\u201d or \u201calter the parties\u2019 rights.\u201d Hibbs, supra, at 98.\nThus, the Court of Appeals\u2019 grant of certiorari suspended\nthe finality of the Guam Supreme Court\u2019s judgment and\nprevented the 90-day clock from running while the case\nwas pending before the Court of Appeals. And until the\nNinth Circuit issued its order dismissing the case, the\nappeal remained pending, and the finality of the judgment\nremained suspended.\n   The Governor argues that the judgment was made final\nearlier\u2014either when Congress enacted the statute depriv\ning the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction or when the Court\nof Appeals decided in Santos that the statute applied to\npending cases. But when Congress removed the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s jurisdiction over appeals from Guam, it did not\ndismiss this appeal. Likewise, when the Ninth Circuit\ndetermined in Santos, that Congress had stripped its\njurisdiction over pending appeals, the court did not finally\ndetermine the rights of the parties in this case. The juris\ndiction-stripping statute and Santos may have signaled\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 ultimate dismissal of the appeal, but\nneither created a final judgment in the still-pending case.\nThe attorney general\u2019s appeal remained pending until the\nNinth Circuit issued its dismissal order. And the pend\nency of the appeal continued to \u201craise the question\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether\u201d any further action by the court might affect the\nrelationship of the parties. Hibbs, supra, at 98. Accord\ningly, we hold that the judgment of the Guam Supreme\nCourt did not become final, for purposes of this Court\u2019s\nreview, until the Court of Appeals issued its order dismiss\ning the appeal.\n   We emphasize that our holding is limited to the unique\nprocedural circumstances presented here. Specifically, our\nholding does not extend to improperly filed appeals or\nfilings used as delaying tactics. See Morse v. United\nStates, 270 U. S. 151 (1926) (holding that second applica\ntion for leave to file motion for new trial did not suspend\nthe finality of the lower court\u2019s judgment).\n                              III\n   Having determined that we have jurisdiction, we turn to\nthe merits. As always, we begin with the text of the stat\nute. See Nebraska Dept. of Revenue v. Loewenstein, 513\nU. S. 123, 128 (1994). Guam\u2019s Organic Act states that \u201cno\npublic indebtedness of Guam shall be authorized or al\nlowed in excess of 10 per centum of the aggregate tax\nvaluation of the property in Guam.\u201d 48 U. S. C. \u00a71423a.\nThe present dispute centers on the meaning of the term\n\u201ctax valuation.\u201d In its unmodified form, the word \u201cvalua\ntion\u201d means \u201c[t]he estimated worth of a thing.\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 1721 (4th ed. 1951) (hereinafter Black\u2019s).\nBut as the parties\u2019 competing interpretations demonstrate,\nthere are different sorts of valuations. An appraised\nvaluation is the market value of property. See id., at 129\n(defining \u201cappraise\u201d as \u201cto fix and state the true value of a\nthing\u201d). By contrast, an \u201cassessed valuation\u201d is the\n\u201c[v]alue on each unit of which a prescribed amount must\nbe paid as property taxes.\u201d Id., at 149. These two kinds of\nvaluation are related in practice because a property\u2019s\nassessed valuation generally equals some percentage of its\nappraised valuation. See, e.g., Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11,\n6                     LIMTIACO v. CAMACHO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a724102(f) (defining \u201cvalue\u201d as \u201cthirty-five per cent (35%) of\nthe appraised value\u201d). The assessed valuation therefore\ncould, but typically does not, equal the market value of the\nproperty.\n  Though it has no established definition, the term \u201ctax\nvaluation\u201d most naturally means the value to which the\ntax rate is applied.2 Were it otherwise, the modifier \u201ctax\u201d\nwould have almost no meaning or a meaning inconsistent\nwith ordinary usage. \u201cTax valuation\u201d therefore means\n\u201cassessed valuation\u201d\u2014a term consistently defined as a\nvaluation of property for purposes of taxation. See Black\u2019s\n149; see also id., at 116 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \u201cassessed\nvaluation\u201d as \u201c[t]he worth or value of property established\nby taxing authorities on the basis of which the tax rate is\napplied\u201d).\n  One would not normally refer to a property\u2019s appraised\nvaluation as its \u201ctax valuation.\u201d Appraised valuation is\nsimply market value. And market value may or may not\nrelate to taxation. Usually market value becomes relevant\nto taxation only because a specified percentage of market\nvalue is the assessed value to which taxing authorities\napply the tax rate. It would strain the text to conclude\nthat \u201ctax valuation\u201d means a valuation a step removed\nfrom taxation.\n  The Guam Supreme Court reached a contrary conclu\nsion by interpreting the word \u201ctax\u201d to limit the kinds of\nproperty that qualify for inclusion in the debt-limitation\ncalculation. But that interpretation impermissibly rear\nranges the statutory language. The word \u201ctax\u201d modifies\n\u201cvaluation,\u201d not \u201cproperty.\u201d The phrase \u201ctax valuation\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Guam Legislature passed a law attempting to define the term\n\n\u201ctax valuation.\u201d See Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a724102(l), available at\nhttp://www.guamcourts.org/justicedocs/index.html (as visited Mar. 16,\n2007). But that term appears in Guam\u2019s Organic Act, which is a federal\nstatute. As the Guam Supreme Court correctly determined, Guam\u2019s\nterritorial legislature cannot redefine terms used in a federal statute.\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntherefore refers to the type of valuation to be conducted,\nnot the object that is valued.\n   The Guam Supreme Court also contrasted 48 U. S. C.\n\u00a71423a\u2019s language with explicit references to \u201cassessed\nvaluation\u201d in the debt-limitation provision for the Virgin\nIslands. See \u00a71403 (\u201caggregate assessed valuation\u201d). The\ncourt reasoned that, by using language in \u00a71423a that\ndiffered from that used in the Virgin Islands\u2019 debt-\nlimitation provision, Congress expressed its intent to base\nGuam\u2019s debt limitation on something other than assessed\nvalue. We disagree. Certainly, Congress could have used\nthe term \u201cassessed valuation.\u201d But if Congress had meant\nactual, market, or appraised value, it could have used any\none of those terms as well. See N. W. Halsey & Co. v. Belle\nPlaine, 128 Iowa 467, 104 N. W. 494 (1905) (interpreting\ndebt-limitation provision using phrase \u201cactual value\u201d). Or\nit could have left the word \u201cvaluation\u201d unmodified: State\ncourts interpreting other debt-limitation provisions have\nunderstood \u201cvaluation,\u201d standing alone, to mean the mar\nket or cash value of property. See, e.g., Board of Educa\ntion, Rich Cty. School Dist. v. Passey, 122 Utah 102, 104\u2013\n106, 246 P. 2d 1078, 1079 (1952). At least in this context,\nCongress\u2019 rejection of \u201cassessed\u201d tells us no more than\ndoes its rejection of \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cappraised.\u201d\n   Our interpretation comports with most States\u2019 practice\nof tying the debt limitations of municipalities to assessed\nvaluation. See 15 E. McQuillin, Law of Municipal Corpo\nrations \u00a741:7, p. 422 (3d ed. rev. 2005) (\u201cMost of the consti\ntutional and statutory provisions make the assessed value\nof the taxable property of the municipality the basis for\nascertaining the amount of indebtedness which may be\nincurred . . .\u201d). States that depart from the majority ap\nproach use clear language to do so. See id., at 424\u2013425.\n(\u201cThe standard is generally the assessed value of the\nproperty for taxation, rather than the actual value, where\nthe two are different; but where the constitution or statute\n8                  LIMTIACO v. CAMACHO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nuses the term \u2018actual value,\u2019 such value governs rather\nthan the taxable value\u201d (citing N. W. Halsey & Co., supra;\nfootnote omitted)). Congress has not used such language\nhere. Indeed, as discussed earlier, only a strained reading\nof \u201ctax valuation\u201d would suggest a departure from the\nmajority approach.\n   The Governor suggests that our interpretation would\nresult in no debt limitation at all because Guam may\narbitrarily set its assessment rate above 100 percent of\nmarket value. For two reasons, we think the Governor\nhas overstated this concern. First, most States have long\nbased their debt limitations on assessed value without\nincident. Second, a strong political check exists; property-\nowning voters will not fail to notice if the government sets\nthe assessment rate above market value.\n   Finally, the Governor mistakenly argues that we owe\ndeference to the Guam Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of\nits Organic Act. It may be true that we accord deference\nto territorial courts over matters of purely local concern.\nSee Pernell v. Southall Realty, 416 U. S. 363, 366 (1974)\n(reviewing District of Columbia Court of Appeals\u2019 interpre\ntation of D. C. Code provision). This case does not fit that\nmold, however. The debt-limitation provision protects\nboth Guamanians and the United States from the poten\ntial consequences of territorial insolvency. Thus, this case\nis not a matter of purely local concern. Of course, deci\nsions of the Supreme Court of Guam, as with other territo\nrial courts, are instructive and are entitled to respect\nwhen they indicate how statutory issues, including the\nOrganic Act, apply to matters of local concern. On the\nother hand, the Organic Act is a federal statute, which we\nare bound to construe according to its terms.\n                          IV\n  For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of\nthe Guam Supreme Court and remand the case for pro\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

LIMTIACO, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF \n\n     GUAM, PETITIONER v. FELIX P. CAMACHO, \n\n                GOVERNOR OF GUAM\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF GUAM\n                           [March 27, 2007]\n\n   JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE\nGINSBURG, and JUSTICE ALITO join, concurring in part and\ndissenting in part.\n   I agree that the petition for writ of certiorari was timely,\nand join Part II of the Court\u2019s opinion. I disagree, how\never, that the phrase \u201ctax valuation\u201d in the Organic Act of\nGuam, \u00a711, 64 Stat. 387, as amended, 48 U. S. C. \u00a71423a,\nrefers unambiguously to assessed value. If I could not go\nbeyond statutory text and the sources relied upon by the\nCourt, a coin toss would be my only way to judgment. But\nI look to congressional purpose, which points to appraised\nvalue as the meaning of the term, leaving me in respectful\ndissent.\n   The words \u201ctax valuation\u201d can plausibly be read in\neither of the ways the parties suggest: as synonymous\nwith assessed value (the way the attorney general and the\nCourt read them), because it is the assessed value to\nwhich the tax rate is immediately applied, Guam Code\nAnn., Tit. 11, \u00a7\u00a724102(f), 24103 (1996), or as meaning\nappraised value, because the appraisal is a \u201cvaluation\u201d for\n\u201ctax\u201d purposes. The Court concedes that the term \u201ctax\nvaluation\u201d has no canonical definition, ante, at 6,1 and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The phrase \u201ctax valuation\u201d had been used in debt limitations for\n\nother Territories, see ch. 34, 41 Stat. 1096 (Puerto Rico); ch. 203, 42\n2                      LIMTIACO v. CAMACHO\n\n                          Opinion of SOUTER, J.\n\nsays that the term \u201cvaluation,\u201d standing alone, means\n\u201c \u2018[t]he estimated worth of a thing,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 5 (quoting\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1721 (4th ed. 1951); alteration in\noriginal). Though taking property\u2019s \u201cestimated worth\u201d to\nbe its \u201ctax valuation\u201d would make practical sense, the\nCourt believes that construction would read the word \u201ctax\u201d\nout of the statute. I do not see the objection, though.\nEven if we say \u201cvaluation\u201d means actual value, the word\n\u201ctax\u201d has a job to do, by specifying that the valuation in\nquestion be the valuation used for tax purposes, thus\nruling out an appraisal made solely for the purpose of\ncalculating the debt limitation, with its temptation to\nindulge in creative accounting when money is tight.2 But\nas I said, seeing the legitimacy of this reading just leaves\nus with two textually plausible constructions.\n    I see no tie-breaker in comparing Guam\u2019s debt limita\ntion with those of other Territories. In each Territory\nmentioned by the parties, when Congress imposed a terri\ntorial debt limitation the assessed value was equal to the\nactual value of the property.3 Thus the attorney general\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStat. 599 (Philippines), but in each of those Territories the issue in this\ncase was irrelevant because assessed and appraised values were equal.\nSee infra this page and 3, and nn. 3\u20134.\n   2 Though the Court finds the appraised value to be \u201ca step removed\n\nfrom taxation,\u201d ante, at 6, the connection of the appraised value to the\ntax ultimately imposed is direct enough. It is true that the tax compu\ntation requires multiplying the appraised value by two percentages\n(first 35 percent to get the assessed value, Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11,\n\u00a724102(f) (1996), and then the 0.25 percent tax rate, \u00a724103) while the\nassessed value must only be multiplied by a single percentage. But as\na practical matter, tying the tax to the assessed value ties it to the\nappraised value: multiplying the appraised value by 0.0875 percent (35\npercent times 0.25 percent) will give you the tax every time.\n   3 48 U. S. C. \u00a71401a (\u201c[A]ll taxes on real property in the Virgin Is\n\nlands shall be computed on the basis of the actual value of such prop\nerty\u201d); Haw. Rev.

And the Governor can argue that because the\ndebt limitation in the other Territories was based on the\nactual value, that should go for Guam, too. Nor is the tie\nto be broken by arguing that pegging the territorial debt\nlimit to \u201ctax valuation\u201d suggests that this Territory was\nmeant to be treated more conservatively than a limit\nturning on full value; the suggestion is balanced by the\nquestion (without any answer proposed to us), why Con\ngress would have wished a more restrictive (or nominally\nmore restrictive) regime for certain Territories.4\n  Comparing state practices is no help, either. The Court\nsays that \u201cStates that depart from the majority approach\u201d\nof linking debt limitations to assessed value \u201cuse clear\nlanguage to do so,\u201d ante, at 7, but in the preceding para\ngraph the majority recognizes that state courts \u201chave\nunderstood \u2018valuation,\u2019 standing alone, to mean the mar\nket or cash value of property,\u201d ibid. So it seems a stretch\nto suggest that state laws offer a clear rule that Congress\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncash value of the same\u201d); An Act to Provide Revenue for the People of\nPorto Rico, and for Other Purposes, Tit. I, \u00a78 (1901), reprinted in Acts\nand Resolves of the First Legislative Assembly of Porto Rico 47 (1901),\nLodging of Respondent (Doc. 2a) (\u201cAll taxable property shall be valued\nand assessed at its actual market value\u201d); A Compilation of the Acts of\nthe Philippine Commission, Tit. 10, ch. 56, \u00a7336(a) (1908), Lodging of\nRespondent (Doc. 4) (\u201c[T]he board shall proceed to assess the value of\neach separate parcel of real estate and the improvements thereon, if\nany, at their true value in money\u201d).\n   4 The percentage of the valuation at which the various debt limita\n\ntions were set likewise provides no basis for inferring that Congress\nhad different intentions for different Territories. When the Organic Act\nof Guam was passed in 1950, each of the debt limitations in the Terri\ntories mentioned in n. 3, supra, was also set at 10 percent of the rele\nvant valuation. See 48 U. S. C. \u00a71403 (Virgin Islands); 42 Stat. 116\n(Hawaii); ch. 34, 41 Stat. 1096 (Puerto Rico); ch. 203, 42 Stat. 599\n(Philippines).\n4                     LIMTIACO v. CAMACHO\n\n                        Opinion of SOUTER, J.\n\nmay be presumed to have understood as background;\nbetter to read the state cases as products of the specific\nwording of their particular limitations and the state his\ntory of property taxation. See, e.g., Phelps v. Minneapolis,\n174 Minn. 509, 511\u2013514, 219 N. W. 872, 873\u2013874 (1928)\n(relying on text of limitation, other related provisions, and\nhistory of property taxation); N. W. Halsey & Co. v. Belle\nPlaine, 128 Iowa 467, 470\u2013474, 104 N. W. 494, 495\u2013497\n(1905) (same). It almost goes without saying that neither\nside has cited a state case involving language and back\nground the same as Guam\u2019s.\n   In sum, the congressional mind does not emerge from\nthe words \u201ctax valuation\u201d or any settled construction of\nthat phrase. Fortunately, though, the purpose of the\nlegislation does point to a likely reading. The statute\nitself makes clear that what Congress meant to provide\nwas a practical guarantee against crushing debt on the\nshoulders of future generations, and insolvency with the\ninevitable call for a bailout by Congress. See United\nStates Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of\nAmerica, Inc., 508 U. S. 439, 455 (1993) (\u201c \u2018[L]ook to the\n[law\u2019s] . . . object and policy\u2019 \u201d (quoting United States v.\nHeirs of Boisdor\u00e9, 8 How. 113, 122 (1849))).\n   The attorney general claims that her reading is a better\nfit with these objectives because it ties the legislature\u2019s\nability to incur debt to its willingness to tax. But this is\nhardly so. Under the attorney general\u2019s approach (now\nthe Court\u2019s), the Guam Legislature could double the debt\nlimitation without increasing taxes by a single penny,\nsimply by doubling the assessment rate and cutting the\ntax rate by half.5\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 The\n        specter of mischief extends to an attempt to set the assessment\nrate above 100 percent. The Court contends that political or practical\nconstraints would foreclose this maneuver. See ante, at 8. After\ntoday\u2019s decision, I suppose we may find out.\n                      Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                        5\n\n                           Opinion of SOUTER, J.\n\n   Although it is arguable that tying the debt ceiling to the\nassessed value may to some vague degree enhance legisla\ntive accountability by requiring action to raise the debt\nceiling as debt piles up, I know of no independent sugges\ntion that the debt limit was designed to operate as a politi\ncal discouragement, not as a hard cap. It would, after all,\nhave been strange for Congress to set a debt cap to con\nstrain the Guam Legislature, only to leave the limiting\nfigure subject to easy manipulation by the legislature.\nWhile I know that actual valuation can be manipulated,\ntoo, manipulation of that figure could only be done by\nofficials acting in bad faith and subject to an obvious\npolitical or judicial challenge. The Court\u2019s approach, by\ncontrast, gives the legislature a green light to subvert its\nown stated limit with a clear conscience.6\n   The more practical understanding of what must have\nbeen intended is a statute tying the debt limitation to\nGuam\u2019s capacity to tax property. The actual, market\nvalue of property is the only economic index of Guam\u2019s\nability to collect property taxes to pay its bills,7 the only\nfigure under consideration that is fixed in the real world,\nand the only figure that provides a genuine limitation.\nThis was the figure employed or required by Congress in\neach of the other Territories mentioned above, see n. 3,\nsupra, and I presume that its practical significance was in\nCongress\u2019s mind when it set the debt caps for each of\nthem. I see no reason not to attribute the same practical\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The attorney general\u2019s position would be strengthened if the as\n\nsessment rate appeared in the Organic Act itself, for then the legisla\nture would lack the power to change it. This state of affairs would be\nanalogous to an assessment rate appearing in a state constitution. See,\ne.g., Colo. Const., Art. X, \u00a73(1)(b); La. Const., Art. VII, \u00a718(B). But the\nOrganic Act set no assessment rate, leaving that up to the Guam\nLegislature.\n   7 It is not, of course, the only index of Guam\u2019s capacity to pay its bills;\n\nincome taxation is an obvious source of revenue, see 48 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71421i(a)\u2013(b) (authorizing Guam to collect income tax).\n6                 LIMTIACO v.

Hufstedler, Morrison &amp; Foerster LLP, Los Angeles, CA, for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Legislature of Guam authorized Guam's Governor to issue bonds to fund the Territory's continuing obligations. Concluding that the bonds would violate the debt-limitation provision of the Organic Act of Guam, \u00a7 11, 64 Stat. 387, as amended, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423a, the attorney general<sup>[1]</sup> of Guam refused to sign contracts necessary to issue the bonds. In response, the Governor sought a declaration from the Guam Supreme Court that issuance of the bonds would not violate the Organic Act's debt limitation. The Guam Supreme Court held that \u00a7 1423a limits Guam's allowed indebtedness to 10 percent of the appraised valuation, not the assessed valuation, of taxable property in Guam. We granted certiorari to decide whether Guam's debt limitation must be calculated according to the assessed or the appraised valuation of property in Guam. We hold that it must be calculated based on the assessed valuation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 2003, Guam lacked sufficient revenues to pay its obligations. To supplement revenues, the Guam Legislature authorized the Governor to issue bonds worth approximately $400 million. See Guam <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1417</span> Pub.L. 27-019. The Governor signed the new legislation and prepared to issue the bonds. However, under Guam law, Guam's attorney general must review and approve all government contracts prior to their execution. Guam Code Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a7 22601 (1996). The attorney general concluded that issuance of the bonds would raise the Territory's debt above the level authorized by Guam's Organic Act. See 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423a (prohibiting debt \"in excess of 10 per centum of the aggregate tax valuation of the property in Guam\"). He therefore refused to approve the bond contracts.</p>\n<p>In response, the Governor sought a declaration from the Guam Supreme Court that issuance of the authorized bonds would not cause Guam's debt to exceed the debt limitation. That determination turned, in part, on the meaning of the phrase \"aggregate tax valuation\" in Guam's Organic Act. The attorney general calculated the debt limitation as 10 percent of the assessed valuation of property in Guam. But the Governor calculated the debt limitation as 10 percent of the appraised valuation. Because Guam assesses property at 35 percent of its appraised value, Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7 24102(f), the attorney general's interpretation resulted in a much lower debt limit. The Guam Supreme Court agreed with the Governor and held that 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423a sets the debt limitation at 10 percent of the appraised valuation of property in Guam.</p>\n<p>The attorney general filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See \u00a7 1424-2 (granting Ninth Circuit jurisdiction over appeals from Guam). The Court of Appeals granted the petition in October 2003. While the appeal was pending, Congress amended \u00a7 1424-2 and removed the language that vested jurisdiction in the Ninth Circuit over appeals from Guam. See \u00a7 2, 118 Stat. 2208, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1424-2 (West Supp.2006). In <i>Santos v. Guam,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793225\"><a href=\"/opinion/793225/anthony-duenas-santos-v-the-people-of-the-territor/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1051</span></a></span> (Jan. 3, 2006), the Court of Appeals addressed the effect of the amendment on its jurisdiction. The court held that Congress had stripped its jurisdiction not only prospectively, but also for pending appeals. <i>Id.,</i> at 1054. Citing <i>Santos,</i> the Ninth Circuit dismissed the attorney general's appeal in this case on March 6, 2006. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.</p>\n<p>The attorney general then filed a petition for certiorari in this Court. By statute, certiorari petitions must be filed \"within 90 days after the entry of . . . judgment\" in a lower court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(c). The attorney general filed his petition more than 90 days after the judgment from which he appeals\u0097that of the Guam Supreme Court\u0097was entered. Accordingly, when we granted certiorari in this case, 548 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 36, 165 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2006), we directed the parties to address both the question presented by petitioner and whether the filing of a petition for certiorari or the pendency of a writ of certiorari before the Court of Appeals suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court's judgment for purposes of the 90-day period set out in \u00a7 2101(c).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Only \"a genuinely final judgment\" will trigger \u00a7 2101(c)'s 90-day period for filing a petition for certiorari in this Court. <i>Hibbs v. Winn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136987\"><a href=\"/opinion/136987/hibbs-v-winn/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span>, 98, 124 S.Ct. 2276, 159 L.Ed.2d 172 (2004). In most cases, the 90-day period begins to run immediately upon entry of a lower court's judgment. In some cases, though, the actions of a party or a lower court suspend the finality of a judgment and thereby reset the 90-day \"clock.\" <i>Ibid.</i> For instance, the timely filing of a petition for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1418</span> rehearing with the lower court or a lower court's appropriate decision to rehear an appeal may suspend the finality of a judgment by \"rais[ing] the question whether the court will modify the judgment and alter the parties' rights.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citing <i>Missouri v. Jenkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112414\"><a href=\"/opinion/112414/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 46, 110 S.Ct. 1651, 109 L.Ed.2d 31 (1990)). So long as that question remains open, \"`there is no \"judgment\" to be reviewed,'\" <i>Hibbs, supra,</i> at 98, 124 S.Ct. 2276 (quoting <i>Jenkins, supra,</i> at 46, 110 S.Ct. 1651), and \u00a7 2101(c)'s 90-day period does not run.</p>\n<p>The same reasoning applies here. In 2003, the Court of Appeals appropriately exercised discretionary jurisdiction over the attorney general's appeal. See 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1424-2. By granting the petition for certiorari, the Ninth Circuit raised the possibility that it might \"modify the judgment\" or \"alter the parties' rights.\" <i>Hibbs, supra,</i> at 98, 124 S.Ct. 2276. Thus, the Court of Appeals' grant of certiorari suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court's judgment and prevented the 90-day clock from running while the case was pending before the Court of Appeals. And until the Ninth Circuit issued its order dismissing the case, the appeal remained pending, and the finality of the judgment remained suspended.</p>\n<p>The Governor argues that the judgment was made final earlier\u0097either when Congress enacted the statute depriving the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction or when the Court of Appeals decided in <i>Santos</i> that the statute applied to pending cases. But when Congress removed the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction over appeals from Guam, it did not dismiss this appeal. Likewise, when the Ninth Circuit determined in <i>Santos,</i> that Congress had stripped its jurisdiction over pending appeals, the court did not finally determine the rights of the parties in this case. The jurisdiction-stripping statute and <i>Santos</i> may have signaled the Court of Appeals' ultimate dismissal of the appeal, but neither created a final judgment in the still-pending case. The attorney general's appeal remained pending until the Ninth Circuit issued its dismissal order. And the pendency of the appeal continued to \"raise the question whether\" any further action by the court might affect the relationship of the parties. <i>Hibbs, supra,</i> at 98, 124 S.Ct. 2276. Accordingly, we hold that the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court did not become final, for purposes of this Court's review, until the Court of Appeals issued its order dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p>We emphasize that our holding is limited to the unique procedural circumstances presented here. Specifically, our holding does not extend to improperly filed appeals or filings used as delaying tactics. See <i>Morse v.

But as the parties' competing interpretations demonstrate, there are different <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1419</span> sorts of valuations. An appraised valuation is the market value of property. See <i>id.,</i> at 129, 115 S.Ct. 557 (defining \"appraise\" as \"to fix and state the true value of a thing\"). By contrast, an \"assessed valuation\" is the \"[v]alue on each unit of which a prescribed amount must be paid as property taxes.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 149, 115 S.Ct. 557. These two kinds of valuation are related in practice because a property's assessed valuation generally equals some percentage of its appraised valuation. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7 24102(f) (defining \"value\" as \"thirty-five per cent (35%) of the appraised value\"). The assessed valuation therefore could, but typically does not, equal the market value of the property.</p>\n<p>Though it has no established definition, the term \"tax valuation\" most naturally means the value to which the tax rate is applied.<sup>[2]</sup> Were it otherwise, the modifier \"tax\" would have almost no meaning or a meaning inconsistent with ordinary usage. \"Tax valuation\" therefore means \"assessed valuation\"\u0097a term consistently defined as a valuation of property for purposes of taxation. See Black's 149; see also <i>id.,</i> at 116 (6th ed.1990) (defining \"assessed valuation\" as \"[t]he worth or value of property established by taxing authorities on the basis of which the tax rate is applied\").</p>\n<p>One would not normally refer to a property's appraised valuation as its \"tax valuation.\" Appraised valuation is simply market value. And market value may or may not relate to taxation. Usually market value becomes relevant to taxation only because a specified percentage of market value is the assessed value to which taxing authorities apply the tax rate. It would strain the text to conclude that \"tax valuation\" means a valuation a step removed from taxation.</p>\n<p>The Guam Supreme Court reached a contrary conclusion by interpreting the word \"tax\" to limit the kinds of property that qualify for inclusion in the debt-limitation calculation. But that interpretation impermissibly rearranges the statutory language. The word \"tax\" modifies \"valuation,\" not \"property.\" The phrase \"tax valuation\" therefore refers to the type of valuation to be conducted, not the object that is valued.</p>\n<p>The Guam Supreme Court also contrasted 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423a's language with explicit references to \"assessed valuation\" in the debt-limitation provision for the Virgin Islands. See \u00a7 1403 (\"aggregate assessed valuation\"). The court reasoned that, by using language in \u00a7 1423a that differed from that used in the Virgin Islands' debt-limitation provision, Congress expressed its intent to base Guam's debt limitation on something other than assessed value. We disagree. Certainly, Congress could have used the term \"assessed valuation.\" But if Congress had meant actual, market, or appraised value, it could have used any one of those terms as well. See <i>N.W. Halsey &amp; Co. v. Belle Plaine,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></span> (1905) (interpreting debt-limitation provision using phrase \"actual value\"). Or it could have left the word \"valuation\" unmodified: State courts interpreting other debt-limitation provisions have understood \"valuation,\" standing alone, to mean the market or cash value of property. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Board of Education, Rich Cty. School Dist. v. Passey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1178729\"><a href=\"/opinion/1178729/board-of-education-rich-county-school-dist-v-passe/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Utah</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>, 104-106, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1178729\"><a href=\"/opinion/1178729/board-of-education-rich-county-school-dist-v-passe/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1078</span></a></span>, 1079 (1952). At least <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1420</span> in this context, Congress' rejection of \"assessed\" tells us no more than does its rejection of \"actual\" or \"appraised.\"</p>\n<p>Our interpretation comports with most States' practice of tying the debt limitations of municipalities to assessed valuation. See 15 E. McQuillin, Law of Municipal Corporations \u00a7 41:7, p. 422 (3d ed. rev.2005) (\"Most of the constitutional and statutory provisions make the assessed value of the taxable property of the municipality the basis for ascertaining the amount of indebtedness which may be incurred. . .\"). States that depart from the majority approach use clear language to do so. See <i>id.,</i> at 424-425. (\"The standard is generally the assessed value of the property for taxation, rather than the actual value, where the two are different; but where the constitution or statute uses the term `actual value,' such value governs rather than the taxable value\" (citing <i>N.W. Halsey &amp; Co., supra</i><i>;</i> footnote omitted)). Congress has not used such language here. Indeed, as discussed earlier, only a strained reading of \"tax valuation\" would suggest a departure from the majority approach.</p>\n<p>The Governor suggests that our interpretation would result in no debt limitation at all because Guam may arbitrarily set its assessment rate above 100 percent of market value. For two reasons, we think the Governor has overstated this concern. First, most States have long based their debt limitations on assessed value without incident. Second, a strong political check exists; property-owning voters will not fail to notice if the government sets the assessment rate above market value.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Governor mistakenly argues that we owe deference to the Guam Supreme Court's interpretation of its Organic Act. It may be true that we accord deference to territorial courts over matters of purely local concern. See <i>Pernell v. Southall Realty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109014\"><a href=\"/opinion/109014/pernell-v-southall-realty/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span>, 366, 94 S.Ct. 1723, 40 L.Ed.2d 198 (1974) (reviewing District of Columbia Court of Appeals' interpretation of D.C.Code provision). This case does not fit that mold, however. The debt-limitation provision protects both Guamanians and the United States from the potential consequences of territorial insolvency. Thus, this case is not a matter of purely local concern. Of course, decisions of the Supreme Court of Guam, as with other territorial courts, are instructive and are entitled to respect when they indicate how statutory issues, including the Organic Act, apply to matters of local concern. On the other hand, the Organic Act is a federal statute, which we are bound to construe according to its terms.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court and remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice GINSBURG, and Justice ALITO join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I agree that the petition for writ of certiorari was timely, and join Part II of the Court's opinion. I disagree, however, that the phrase \"tax valuation\" in the Organic Act of Guam, \u00a7 11, 64 Stat. 387, as amended, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423a, refers unambiguously to assessed value. If I could not go beyond statutory text and the sources relied upon by the Court, a coin toss would be my only way to judgment. But I look to congressional purpose, which points to appraised value as the meaning of the term, leaving me in respectful dissent.</p>\n<p>The words \"tax valuation\" can plausibly be read in either of the ways the parties <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1421</span> suggest: as synonymous with assessed value (the way the attorney general and the Court read them), because it is the assessed value to which the tax rate is immediately applied, Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7\u00a7 24102(f), 24103 (1996), or as meaning appraised value, because the appraisal is a \"valuation\" for \"tax\" purposes. The Court concedes that the term \"tax valuation\" has no canonical definition, <i>ante,</i> at 1419,<sup>[1]</sup> and says that the term \"valuation,\" standing alone, means \"`[t]he estimated worth of a thing,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 1418 (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1721 (4th ed.1951); alteration in original). Though taking property's \"estimated worth\" to be its \"tax valuation\" would make practical sense, the Court believes that construction would read the word \"tax\" out of the statute. I do not see the objection, though. Even if we say \"valuation\" means actual value, the word \"tax\" has a job to do, by specifying that the valuation in question be the valuation used for tax purposes, thus ruling out an appraisal made solely for the purpose of calculating the debt limitation, with its temptation to indulge in creative accounting when money is tight.<sup>[2]</sup> But as I said, seeing the legitimacy of this reading just leaves us with two textually plausible constructions.</p>\n<p>I see no tie-breaker in comparing Guam's debt limitation with those of other Territories. In each Territory mentioned by the parties, when Congress imposed a territorial debt limitation the assessed value was equal to the actual value of the property.<sup>[3]</sup> Thus the attorney general can stress the significance of assessed value and argue that because the debt limitation in the other Territories was based on the assessed value, the same should be true for Guam. And the Governor can argue that because the debt limitation in the other Territories was based on the actual value, that should go for Guam, too. Nor is the tie to be broken by arguing that pegging the territorial debt limit to \"tax valuation\" suggests that this Territory was meant to be treated more conservatively than a limit turning on full value; the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1422</span> suggestion is balanced by the question (without any answer proposed to us), why Congress would have wished a more restrictive (or nominally more restrictive) regime for certain Territories.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Comparing state practices is no help, either. The Court says that \"States that depart from the majority approach\" of linking debt limitations to assessed value \"use clear language to do so,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1420, but in the preceding paragraph the majority recognizes that state courts \"have understood `valuation,' standing alone, to mean the market or cash value of property,\" <i>ibid.</i> So it seems a stretch to suggest that state laws offer a clear rule that Congress may be presumed to have understood as background; better to read the state cases as products of the specific wording of their particular limitations and the state history of property taxation. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Phelps v. Minneapolis,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Minn.</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></span>, 511-514, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></span>, 873-874 (1928) (relying on text of limitation, other related provisions, and history of property taxation); <i>N.W. Halsey &amp; Co. v. Belle Plaine,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></span>, 470-474, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></span>, 495-497 (1905) (same). It almost goes without saying that neither side has cited a state case involving language and background the same as Guam's.</p>\n<p>In sum, the congressional mind does not emerge from the words \"tax valuation\" or any settled construction of that phrase. Fortunately, though, the purpose of the legislation does point to a likely reading. The statute itself makes clear that what Congress meant to provide was a practical guarantee against crushing debt on the shoulders of future generations, and insolvency with the inevitable call for a bailout by Congress. See <i>United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112877\"><a href=\"/opinion/112877/united-states-nat-bank-of-ore-v-independent-ins-ag/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span>, 455, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 124 L.Ed.2d 402 (1993) (\"`[L]ook to the [law's] . . . object and policy'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Heirs of Boisdore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86514\"><a href=\"/opinion/86514/united-states-v-boisdores-heirs/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 122, 12 L.Ed. 1009 (1849))).</p>\n<p>The attorney general claims that her reading is a better fit with these objectives because it ties the legislature's ability to incur debt to its willingness to tax. But this is hardly so. Under the attorney general's approach (now the Court's), the Guam Legislature could double the debt limitation without increasing taxes by a single penny, simply by doubling the assessment rate and cutting the tax rate by half.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Although it is arguable that tying the debt ceiling to the assessed value may to some vague degree enhance legislative accountability by requiring action to raise the debt ceiling as debt piles up, I know of no independent suggestion that the debt limit was designed to operate as a political discouragement, not as a hard cap. It would, after all, have been strange for Congress to set a debt cap to constrain the Guam Legislature, only to leave the limiting figure subject to easy manipulation by the legislature. While I know that actual valuation can be manipulated, too, manipulation of that figure could only be done by officials acting in bad faith and subject to an obvious political or judicial challenge. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1423</span> The Court's approach, by contrast, gives the legislature a green light to subvert its own stated limit with a clear conscience.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The more practical understanding of what must have been intended is a statute tying the debt limitation to Guam's capacity to tax property. The actual, market value of property is the only economic index of Guam's ability to collect property taxes to pay its bills,<sup>[7]</sup> the only figure under consideration that is fixed in the real world, and the only figure that provides a genuine limitation. This was the figure employed or required by Congress in each of the other Territories mentioned above, see n. 3, <i>supra,</i> and I presume that its practical significance was in Congress's mind when it set the debt caps for each of them. I see no reason not to attribute the same practical assessment to Congress in this instance.</p>\n<p>I would affirm.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  At the time suit was filed, Douglas Moylan served as Guam's attorney general. Alicia Limtiaco has since been elected to the position, and she continues the case in Moylan's place.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Guam Legislature passed a law attempting to define the term \"tax valuation.\" See Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7 24102<i>(l),</i> available at http://www.guamcourts.org/justicedocs/index.html (as visited Mar. 16, 2007). But that term appears in Guam's Organic Act, which is a federal statute. As the Guam Supreme Court correctly determined, Guam's territorial legislature cannot redefine terms used in a federal statute.</p>\n<p>[1]  The phrase \"tax valuation\" had been used in debt limitations for other Territories, see ch. 34, 41 Stat. 1096 (Puerto Rico); ch. 203, 42 Stat. 599 (Philippines), but in each of those Territories the issue in this case was irrelevant because assessed and appraised values were equal. See <i>infra</i> this page and 3, and nn. 3-4.</p>\n<p>[2]  Though the Court finds the appraised value to be \"a step removed from taxation,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1419, the connection of the appraised value to the tax ultimately imposed is direct enough. It is true that the tax computation requires multiplying the appraised value by two percentages (first 35 percent to get the assessed value, Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7 24102(f) (1996), and then the 0.25 percent tax rate, \u00a7 24103) while the assessed value must only be multiplied by a single percentage. But as a practical matter, tying the tax to the assessed value ties it to the appraised value: multiplying the appraised value by 0.0875 percent (35 percent times 0.25 percent) will give you the tax every time.</p>\n<p>[3]  48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401a (\"[A]ll taxes on real property in the Virgin Islands shall be computed on the basis of the actual value of such property\"); Haw.Rev.Stat., ch. 98, \u00a7 1212 (1905), Lodging of Respondent (Doc. 2b) (\"[A]ll real property and all personal property within the Territory shall be subject to an annual tax of one per cent. upon the full cash value of the same\"); An Act to Provide Revenue for the People of Porto Rico, and for Other Purposes, Tit. I, \u00a7 8 (1901), reprinted in Acts and Resolves of the First Legislative Assembly of Porto Rico 47 (1901), Lodging of Respondent (Doc. 2a) (\"All taxable property shall be valued and assessed at its actual market value\"); A Compilation of the Acts of the Philippine Commission, Tit. 10, ch. 56, \u00a7 336(a) (1908), Lodging of Respondent (Doc. 4) (\"[T]he board shall proceed to assess the value of each separate parcel of real estate and the improvements thereon, if any, at their true value in money\").</p>\n<p>[4]  The percentage of the valuation at which the various debt limitations were set likewise provides no basis for inferring that Congress had different intentions for different Territories. When the Organic Act of Guam was passed in 1950, each of the debt limitations in the Territories mentioned in n. 3, <i>supra,</i> was also set at 10 percent of the relevant valuation. See 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403 (Virgin Islands); 42 Stat. 116 (Hawaii); ch. 34, 41 Stat. 1096 (Puerto Rico); ch. 203, 42 Stat. 599 (Philippines).</p>\n<p>[5]  The specter of mischief extends to an attempt to set the assessment rate above 100 percent. The Court contends that political or practical constraints would foreclose this maneuver. See <i>ante,</i> at 1420. After today's decision, I suppose we may find out.</p>\n<p>[6]  The attorney general's position would be strengthened if the assessment rate appeared in the Organic Act itself, for then the legislature would lack the power to change it. This state of affairs would be analogous to an assessment rate appearing in a state constitution. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Colo. Const., Art. X, \u00a7 3(1)(b); La. Const., Art. VII, \u00a7 18(B). But the Organic Act set no assessment rate, leaving that up to the Guam Legislature.</p>\n<p>[7]  It is not, of course, the only index of Guam's capacity to pay its bills; income taxation is an obvious source of revenue, see 48 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1421i(a)-(b) (authorizing Guam to collect income tax).</p>\n\n</div>",
