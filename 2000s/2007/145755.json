Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), our decision in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), is retroactive to cases already final on direct review. We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Respondent Marvin Bockting lived in Las Vegas, Nevada, with his wife, Laura Bockting, their 3-year-old daughter Honesty, and Laura's 6-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, Autumn. One night, while respondent was at work, Autumn awoke from a dream crying, but she refused to tell her mother what was wrong, explaining: \"`[D]addy said you would make him leave and that he would beat my butt if I told you.'\" App. 119. After her mother reassured her, Autumn said that respondent had frequently forced her to engage in numerous and varied sexual acts with him. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The next day, Laura Bockting confronted respondent and asked him to leave the house. He did so but denied any wrongdoing. Two days later, Laura called a rape crisis hotline and brought Autumn to the hospital for an examination. At the hospital, Detective Charles Zinovitch from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sexual Assault Unit attempted to interview Autumn but found her too distressed to discuss the assaults. Detective Zinovitch then ordered a rape examination, which revealed strong physical evidence of sexual assaults. See Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order in <i>Nevada v. Bockting,</i> Case No. C-83110 (D.Nev., Sept. 5, 1994); App. 47, 119.</p>\n<p>Two days later, Detective Zinovitch interviewed Autumn in the presence of her mother, and at that time, Autumn provided a detailed description of acts of sexual assault carried out by respondent; Autumn also demonstrated those acts using anatomically correct dolls. <i>Id.,</i> at 47-48; 119. Respondent was then arrested, and a state grand jury indicted him on four counts of sexual assault on a minor under 14 years of age.</p>\n<p>At respondent's preliminary hearing, Autumn testified that she understood the difference between a truth and a lie, but she became upset when asked about the assaults. Although she initially agreed that respondent had touched her in a way that \"[she] didn't think he was supposed to touch [her],\" <i>id.,</i> at 14, she later stated that she could not remember how respondent had touched her or what she had told her mother or the detective, <i>id.,</i> at 19-21. The trial court, however, found the testimony of Laura Bockting and Detective Zinovitch to be sufficient to hold respondent for trial.</p>\n<p>At trial, the court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether Autumn could testify. After it became apparent that Autumn was too distressed to be sworn in, <i>id.,</i> at 25-26, the State moved under Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 51.385 (2003)<sup>[1]</sup> to allow Laura Bockting and Detective <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1178</span> Zinovitch to recount Autumn's statements regarding the sexual assaults. App. 25-27. Under the Nevada statute, out-of-court statements made by a child under 10 years of age describing acts of sexual assault or physical abuse of the child may be admitted if the court finds that the child is unavailable or unable to testify and that \"the time, content and circumstances of the statement provide sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\" \u00a7 51.385(1)(a). Over defense counsel's objection that admission of this testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause, <i>id.,</i> at 27-28, the trial court found sufficient evidence of reliability to satisfy \u00a7 51.385.</p>\n<p>As a result of this ruling, Laura Bockting and Detective Zinovitch were permitted at trial to recount Autumn's out-of-court statements about the assaults. Laura Bockting also testified that respondent was the only male who had had the opportunity to assault Autumn. In addition, the prosecution introduced evidence regarding Autumn's medical exam. Respondent testified in his own defense and denied the assaults, and the defense brought out the fact that Autumn, unlike many children her age, had acquired some knowledge about sexual acts, since she had seen respondent and her mother engaging in sexual intercourse and had become familiar with sexual terms. <i>Id.,</i> at 118.</p>\n<p>The jury found respondent guilty of three counts of sexual assault on a minor under the age of 14, and the trial court imposed two consecutive life sentences and another concurrent life sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondent took an appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court, which handed down its final decision in 1993, more than a decade before <i>Crawford.</i><sup>[2]</sup> In analyzing respondent's contention that the admission of Autumn's out-of-court statements had violated his Confrontation Clause rights, the Nevada Supreme Court looked to <i>Ohio v. Roberts,</i> 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), which was then the governing precedent of this Court. See <i>Bockting v. State,</i> 109 Nev. 103, 847 P.2d 1364 (1993) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>. Roberts</i> had held that the Confrontation Clause permitted the admission of a hearsay statement made by a declarant who was unavailable to testify if the statement bore sufficient indicia of reliability, either because the statement fell within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or because there were \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\" relating to the statement in question. 448 U.S., at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. Applying <i>Roberts,</i> the Nevada Supreme Court held that the admission of Autumn's statements was constitutional because the circumstances surrounding the making of the statements provided particularized guarantees of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1179</span> trustworthiness. The Court cited the \"natural spontaneity\" of Autumn's initial statements to her mother, her reiteration of the same account to Detective Zinovitch several days later, her use of anatomically correct dolls to demonstrate the assaults, and her detailed descriptions of sexual acts with which a 6-year-old would generally not be familiar. <i>Bockting, supra,</i> at 109-112, 847 P.2d, at 1368-1370.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Respondent then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, arguing that the Nevada Supreme Court's decision violated his Confrontation Clause rights. The District Court denied the petition, holding that respondent was not entitled to relief under the habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), because the Nevada Supreme Court's decision was not \"contrary to\" and did not \"involv[e] an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" Order in <i>Bockting v. Bayer,</i> No. CV-N-98-0764-ECR (Mar. 19, 2002), App. 69-70. Respondent then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p>While this appeal was pending, we issued our opinion in <i>Crawford,</i> in which we overruled <i>Roberts</i> and held that \"[t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial\" are admissible \"only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine [the witness].\" 541 U.S., at 59, 124 S.Ct. 1354. See also <i>Davis v. Washington,</i> 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006). We noted that the outcome in <i>Roberts</i>\u0097as well as the outcome in all similar cases decided by this Court\u0097was consistent with the rule announced in <i>Crawford,</i> but we concluded that the interpretation of the Confrontation Clause set out in <i>Roberts</i> was unsound in several respects. See <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 60, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (\"Although the results of our decisions have generally been faithful to the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause, the same cannot be said of our rationales\"). First, we observed that <i>Roberts</i> potentially excluded too much testimony because it imposed Confrontation Clause restrictions on nontestimonial hearsay not governed by that Clause. 541 U.S., at 60, 124 S.Ct. 1354. At the same time, we noted, the <i>Roberts</i> test was too \"malleable\" in permitting the admission of <i>ex parte</i> testimonial statements. 541 U.S., at 60, 124 S.Ct. 1354. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Where testimonial statements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment's protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much less to amorphous notions of `reliability.' ... Admitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right to confrontation. To be sure, the Clause's ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 61, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>On appeal from the denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus, respondent contended that if the rule in <i>Crawford</i> had been applied to his case, Autumn's out-of-court statements could not have been admitted into evidence and the jury would not have convicted him. Respondent further <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1180</span> argued that <i>Crawford</i> should have been applied to his case because the <i>Crawford</i> rule was either (1) an old rule in existence at the time of his conviction or (2) a \"`watershed'\" rule that implicated \"the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\" <i>Saffle v. Parks,</i> 494 U.S. 484, 495, 110 S.Ct. 1257, 108 L.Ed.2d 415 (1990) (quoting <i>Teague,</i> 489 U.S., at 311, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court, holding that <i>Crawford</i> applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. <i>Bockting v. Bayer,</i> 399 F.3d 1010, as amended, 408 F.3d 1127 (2005). In the panel's lead opinion, Judge McKeown concluded that <i>Crawford</i> announced a new rule of criminal procedure, 399 F.3d, at 1014-1016, but that the decision was nevertheless retroactive on collateral review because it announced a watershed rule that \"rework[ed] our understanding of bedrock criminal procedure,\" <i>id.,</i> at 1016.<sup>[3]</sup> Judge Noonan concurred, but his preferred analysis differed from Judge McKeown's. Judge Noonan believed that <i>Crawford</i> did not announce a new rule, 399 F.3d, at 1022-1024, but \"[a]s an alternative to [this] analysis and in order to provide a precedent for [the] court,\" he \"also concur[red] in Judge McKeown's analysis and opinion,\" <i>id.,</i> at 1024. Judge Wallace, concurring and dissenting, agreed with Judge McKeown that <i>Crawford</i> announced a new procedural rule but arguing that <i>Crawford</i> did not rise to the level of a watershed rule under this Court's jurisprudence. The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, with nine judges dissenting. 418 F.3d 1055 (2005).</p>\n<p>The panel's decision that <i>Crawford</i> is retroactive to cases on collateral review conflicts with the decision of every other Court of Appeals and State Supreme Court that has addressed this issue.<sup>[4]</sup> We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2017, 164 L.Ed.2d 778 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In <i>Teague</i> and subsequent cases, we have laid out the framework to be used in determining whether a rule announced in one of our opinions should be applied retroactively to judgments in criminal cases that are already final on direct review. Under the <i>Teague</i> framework, an old rule applies both on direct and collateral review, but a new rule is generally applicable only to cases that are still on direct review. See <i>Griffith v. Kentucky,</i> 479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987). A new rule applies retroactively in a collateral proceeding only if (1) the rule is substantive or (2) the rule is a \"`watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\" <i>Saffle, supra,</i> at 495, 110 S.Ct. 1257 (quoting <i>Teague,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1181</span> <i>supra,</i> at 311, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In this case, it is undisputed that respondent's conviction became final on direct appeal well before <i>Crawford</i> was decided. We therefore turn to the question whether <i>Crawford</i> applied an old rule or announced a new one. A new rule is defined as \"a rule that ... was not `<i>dictated</i> by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final.'\" <i>Saffle, supra,</i> at 488, 110 S.Ct. 1257 (quoting <i>Teague, supra,</i> at 301, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion); emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>Applying this definition, it is clear that <i>Crawford</i> announced a new rule. The <i>Crawford</i> rule was not \"dictated\" by prior precedent. Quite the opposite is true: The <i>Crawford</i> rule is flatly inconsistent with the prior governing precedent, <i>Roberts,</i> which <i>Crawford</i> overruled. See <i>Davis,</i> 547 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2266. \"The explicit overruling of an earlier holding no doubt creates a new rule.\" <i>Saffle, supra,</i> at 488, 110 S.Ct. 1257.</p>\n<p>In concluding that <i>Crawford</i> merely applied an old rule, Judge Noonan relied on our observation in <i>Crawford</i> that the holdings in our prior decisions, including those that applied the <i>Roberts</i> rule, had been generally consistent with the rule announced in <i>Crawford</i> (and with the Framers' understanding of the meaning of the Confrontation Clause, which provided the basis for the <i>Crawford</i> decision). See 541 U.S., at 57-59, 124 S.Ct. 1354. But the <i>Crawford</i> Court was quick to note that \"the rationales\" of our prior decisions had been inconsistent with the <i>Crawford</i> rule. <i>Id.,</i> at 60, 124 S.Ct. 1354. \"`The \"new rule\" principle ... validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts even though they are shown to be contrary to later decisions.'\" <i>Lockhart v. Fretwell,</i> 506 U.S. 364, 372-373, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993) (quoting <i>Butler v. McKellar,</i> 494 U.S. 407, 414, 110 S.Ct. 1212, 108 L.Ed.2d 347 (1990)). And it is stating the obvious to say that, prior to <i>Crawford,</i> \"reasonable jurists,\" <i>Graham v. Collins,</i> 506 U.S. 461, 467, 113 S.Ct. 892, 122 L.Ed.2d 260 (1993), could have reached the conclusion that the <i>Roberts</i> rule was the rule that governed the admission of hearsay statements made by an unavailable declarant.</p>\n<p>Because the <i>Crawford</i> rule was not dictated by the governing precedent existing at the time when respondent's conviction became final, the <i>Crawford</i> rule is a new rule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Because <i>Crawford</i> announced a \"new rule\" and because it is clear and undisputed that the rule is procedural and not substantive, that rule cannot be applied in this collateral attack on respondent's conviction unless it is a \"`watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\" <i>Saffle,</i> 494 U.S., at 495, 110 S.Ct. 1257 (quoting <i>Teague,</i> 489 U.S., at 311, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion)). This exception is \"extremely narrow,\" <i>Schriro v. Summerlin,</i> 542 U.S. 348, 352, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004). We have observed that it is \"`unlikely'\" that any such rules \"`ha[ve] yet to emerge,'\" <i>ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Tyler v. Cain,</i> 533 U.S. 656, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001); internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>O'Dell v. Netherland,</i> 521 U.S. 151, 157, 117 S.Ct. 1969, 138 L.Ed.2d 351 (1997); <i>Graham, supra,</i> at 478, 113 S.Ct. 892; <i>Teague, supra,</i> at 313, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion). And in the years since <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1182</span> <i>Teague,</i> we have rejected every claim that a new rule satisfied the requirements for watershed status. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Summerlin, supra</i> (rejecting retroactivity for <i>Ring v. Arizona,</i> 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002)); <i>Beard v. Banks,</i> 542 U.S. 406, 124 S.Ct. 2504, 159 L.Ed.2d 494 (2004) (rejecting retroactivity for <i>Mills v. Maryland,</i> 486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988)); <i>O'Dell, supra</i> (rejecting retroactivity for <i>Simmons v. South Carolina,</i> 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994)); <i>Gilmore v. Taylor,</i> 508 U.S. 333, 113 S.Ct. 2112, 124 L.Ed.2d 306 (1993) (rejecting retroactivity for a new rule relating to jury instructions on homicide); <i>Sawyer v. Smith,</i> 497 U.S. 227, 110 S.Ct. 2822, 111 L.Ed.2d 193 (1990) (rejecting retroactivity for <i>Caldwell v. Mississippi,</i> 472 U.S. 320, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985)).</p>\n<p>In order to qualify as watershed, a new rule must meet two requirements. First, the rule must be necessary to prevent \"an `\"impermissibly large risk\"'\" of an inaccurate conviction. <i>Summerlin, supra,</i> at 356, 124 S.Ct. 2519; see also <i>Tyler,</i> 533 U.S., at 665, 121 S.Ct. 2478. Second, the rule must \"alter our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). We consider each of these requirements in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The <i>Crawford</i> rule does not satisfy the first requirement relating to an impermissibly large risk of an inaccurate conviction. To be sure, the <i>Crawford</i> rule reflects the Framers' preferred mechanism (cross-examination) for ensuring that inaccurate out-of-court testimonial statements are not used to convict an accused. But in order for a new rule to meet the accuracy requirement at issue here, \"[i]t is ... not enough ... to say that [the] rule is aimed at improving the accuracy of trial,\" <i>Sawyer,</i> 497 U.S., at 242, 110 S.Ct. 2822 or that the rule \"is directed toward the enhancement of reliability and accuracy in some sense,\" <i>id.,</i> at 243, 110 S.Ct. 2822. Instead, the question is whether the new rule remedied \"an `\"impermissibly large risk\"'\" of an inaccurate conviction. <i>Summerlin, supra,</i> at 366, 124 S.Ct. 2519.</p>\n<p>Guidance in answering this question is provided by <i>Gideon v. Wainwright,</i> 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), to which we have repeatedly referred in discussing the meaning of the <i>Teague</i> exception at issue here. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Beard, supra,</i> at 417, 124 S.Ct. 2504; <i>Saffle, supra,</i> at 495, 110 S.Ct. 1257; <i>Gilmore, supra,</i> at 364, 113 S.Ct. 2112 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). In <i>Gideon,</i> the only case that we have identified as qualifying under this exception, the Court held that counsel must be appointed for any indigent defendant charged with a felony. When a defendant who wishes to be represented by counsel is denied representation, <i>Gideon</i> held, the risk of an unreliable verdict is intolerably high. See <i>Mickens v. Taylor,</i> 535 U.S. 162, 166, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002); <i>United States v. Cronic,</i> 466 U.S. 648, 658-659, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984); <i>Gideon, supra,</i> at 344-345, 83 S.Ct. 792. The new rule announced in <i>Gideon</i> eliminated this risk.</p>\n<p>The <i>Crawford</i> rule is in no way comparable to the <i>Gideon</i> rule. The <i>Crawford</i> rule is much more limited in scope, and the relationship of that rule to the accuracy of the factfinding process is far less direct and profound. <i>Crawford</i> overruled <i>Roberts</i> because <i>Roberts</i> was inconsistent with the original understanding of the meaning of the Confrontation Clause, not because the Court reached the conclusion that the overall effect of the <i>Crawford</i> rule would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1183</span> be to improve the accuracy of fact finding in criminal trials. Indeed, in <i>Crawford</i> we recognized that even under the <i>Roberts</i> rule, this Court had never specifically approved the introduction of testimonial hearsay statements. 542 U.S., at 57-60, 124 S.Ct. 2373. Accordingly, it is not surprising that the overall effect of <i>Crawford</i> with regard to the accuracy of fact-finding in criminal cases is not easy to assess.</p>\n<p>With respect to <i>testimonial</i> out-of-court statements, <i>Crawford</i> is more restrictive than was <i>Roberts,</i> and this may improve the accuracy of fact-finding in some criminal cases. Specifically, under <i>Roberts,</i> there may have been cases in which courts erroneously determined that testimonial statements were reliable. But see 418 F.3d, at 1058 (O'Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (observing that it is unlikely that this occurred \"in anything but the exceptional case\"). But whatever improvement in reliability <i>Crawford</i> produced in this respect must be considered together with <i>Crawford's</i> elimination of Confrontation Clause protection against the admission of unreliable out-of-court nontestimonial statements. Under <i>Roberts,</i> an out-of-court nontestimonial statement not subject to prior cross-examination could not be admitted without a judicial determination regarding reliability. Under <i>Crawford,</i> on the other hand, the Confrontation Clause has no application to such statements and therefore permits their admission even if they lack indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p>It is thus unclear whether <i>Crawford,</i> on the whole, decreased or increased the number of unreliable out-of-court statements that may be admitted in criminal trials. But the question here is not whether <i>Crawford</i> resulted in some net improvement in the accuracy of fact finding in criminal cases. Rather, \"the question is whether testimony admissible under <i>Roberts</i> is so much more unreliable than that admissible under <i>Crawford</i> that the <i>Crawford</i> rule is `one without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is <i>seriously</i> diminished.'\" 399 F.3d, at 1028 (Wallace, J., concurring and dissenting) (quoting <i>Summerlin,</i> 542 U.S., at 352, 124 S.Ct. 2519) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). <i>Crawford</i> did not effect a change of this magnitude.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The <i>Crawford</i> rule also did not \"alter our understanding of the <i>bedrock procedural elements</i> essential to the fairness of a proceeding.\" <i>Sawyer, supra,</i> at 242, 110 S.Ct. 2822 (internal quotations marks omitted and emphasis in original). Contrary to the suggestion of the Court of Appeals, see 399 F.3d, at 1019 (relying on the conclusion that \"the right of cross-examination as an adjunct to the constitutional right of confrontation\" is a \"bedrock procedural rul[e]\"), this requirement cannot be met simply by showing that a new procedural rule is <i>based on</i> a \"bedrock\" right. We have frequently held that the <i>Teague</i> bar to retroactivity applies to new rules that are based on \"bedrock\" constitutional rights. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Beard,</i> 542 U.S., at 418, 124 S.Ct. 2504.

BOCKTING\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 05\u2013595.      Argued November 1, 2006\u2014Decided February 28, 2007\nAt respondent\u2019s trial for sexual assault on his 6-year-old stepdaughter,\n  the court determined that the child was too distressed to testify and\n  allowed respondent\u2019s wife and a police detective to recount her out-of\n  court statements about the assaults, as permitted by Nevada law, re\n  jecting respondent\u2019s claim that admitting this testimony would vio\n  late the Confrontation Clause. He was convicted and sentenced to\n  prison. On direct appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court found the\n  child\u2019s statements constitutional under Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56,\n  then this Court\u2019s governing precedent, which had held that the Con\n  frontation Clause permitted the admission of a hearsay statement\n  made by a declarant unavailable to testify if the statement bore suffi\n  cient indicia of reliability, id., at 66. Respondent renewed his Con\n  frontation Clause claim in a subsequent federal habeas petition,\n  which the District Court denied. While his appeal was pending in\n  the Ninth Circuit, this Court overruled Roberts in Crawford v. Wash\n  ington, 541 U. S. 36, holding that \u201ctestimonial statements of wit\n  nesses absent from trial\u201d are admissible \u201conly where the declarant is\n  unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportu\n  nity to cross-examine [the witness],\u201d id., at 59, and concluding that\n  Roberts\u2019 interpretation of the Confrontation Clause was unsound, id.,\n  at 60. Respondent contended that had Crawford been applied to his\n  case, the child\u2019s statements would not have been admitted, and that\n  it should have been applied because it was either an old rule in exis\n  tence at the time of his conviction or a \u201c \u2018watershed rul[e] of criminal\n  procedure\u2019 implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the\n  criminal proceeding,\u201d Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 495 (quoting\n  Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 311 (plurality opinion)). The Ninth\n2                      WHORTON v. BOCKTING\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    Circuit reversed, holding that Crawford was a new rule, but a water\n    shed rule that applies retroactively to cases on collateral review.\nHeld: Crawford announced a new rule of criminal procedure that does\n not fall within the Teague exception for watershed rules. Pp. 8\u201314.\n    (a) Under Teague\u2019s framework, an old rule applies both on direct\n and collateral review, but a new rule generally applies only to cases\n still on direct review and applies retroactively in a collateral proceed\n ing only if it (1) is substantive or (2) is a watershed rule that impli\n cates \u201cthe fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceed\n ing.\u201d Respondent\u2019s conviction became final on direct appeal well\n before Crawford was decided, and Crawford announced a new rule,\n i.e., \u201ca rule that . . . was not \u2018dictated by precedent existing at the\n time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final,\u2019 \u201d Saffle, supra, at 488.\n It is flatly inconsistent with Roberts, which it overruled. \u201cThe explicit\n overruling of an earlier holding no doubt creates a new rule.\u201d Saffle,\n supra, at 488. Prior to Crawford, \u201creasonable jurists,\u201d Graham v.\n Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 467, could have concluded that Roberts gov\n erned the admission of testimonial hearsay statements made by an\n unavailable declarant. Pp. 8\u20139.\n    (b) Because Crawford announced a new rule and because that rule\n is procedural and not substantive, it cannot be applied here unless it\n is a \u201cwatershed rul[e]\u201d that implicates \u201cthe fundamental fairness and\n accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\u201d This exception is \u201cextremely\n narrow,\u201d Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U. S. 348, 351, and since Teague,\n this Court has rejected every claim that a new rule has satisfied the\n requirements necessary to qualify as a watershed. The Crawford\n rule does not meet those two requirements. Pp. 10\u201314.\n       (1) First, the rule does not implicate \u201cthe fundamental fairness\n and accuracy of the criminal proceeding\u201d because it is not necessary\n to prevent \u201can \u2018 \u201cimpermissibly large risk\u201d \u2019 \u201d of an inaccurate convic\n tion, Summerlin, supra, at 356. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335,\n the only case that this Court has identified as qualifying under this\n exception, provides guidance. There, the Court held that counsel\n must be appointed for an indigent defendant charged with a felony\n because, when such a defendant is denied representation, the risk of\n an unreliable verdict is intolerably high. The Crawford rule is not\n comparable to the Gideon rule. It is much more limited in scope, and\n its relationship to the accuracy of the factfinding process is far less\n direct and profound. Crawford overruled Roberts because Roberts\n was inconsistent with the original understanding of the Confronta\n tion Clause, not because the Crawford rule\u2019s overall effect would be to\n improve the accuracy of factfinding in criminal trials. With respect to\n testimonial out-of-court statements, Crawford is more restrictive\n than Roberts, which may improve the accuracy of factfinding in some\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  criminal cases. But whatever improvement in reliability Crawford\n  produced must be considered together with Crawford\u2019s elimination of\n  Confrontation Clause protection against the admission of unreliable\n  out-of-court nontestimonial statements. It is thus unclear whether\n  Crawford decreased or increased the number of unreliable out-of\n  court statements that may be admitted in criminal trials. But the\n  question is not whether Crawford resulted in some net improvement\n  in the accuracy of factfinding in criminal cases, but, as the dissent be\n  low noted, whether testimony admissible under Roberts is so much\n  more unreliable that, without the Crawford rule, \u201c \u2018the likelihood of\n  an accurate conviction is seriously diminished,\u2019 \u201d Summerlin, supra,\n  at 352. Crawford did not effect a change of this magnitude. Pp. 11\u2013\n  13.\n       (2) Second, the Crawford rule did not \u201calter [this Court\u2019s] under\n  standing of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness\n  of a proceeding,\u201d Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 242. The Court has\n  \u201cnot hesitated to hold that less sweeping and fundamental rules\u201d\n  than Gideon\u2019s do not qualify. Beard v. Banks, 542 U. S. 406, 418.\n  The Crawford rule, while certainly important, is not in the same\n  category with Gideon, which effected a profound and \u201c \u2018sweeping\u2019 \u201d\n  change.

Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), our\ndecision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), is\nretroactive to cases already final on direct review. We\nhold that it is not.\n                                          I\n\n                                          A\n\n  Respondent Marvin Bockting lived in Las Vegas, Ne\nvada, with his wife, Laura Bockting, their 3-year-old\ndaughter Honesty, and Laura\u2019s 6-year-old daughter from a\nprevious relationship, Autumn. One night, while respon\ndent was at work, Autumn awoke from a dream crying,\nbut she refused to tell her mother what was wrong, ex\nplaining: \u201c \u2018[D]addy said you would make him leave and\nthat he would beat my butt if I told you.\u2019 \u201d App. 119. After\nher mother reassured her, Autumn said that respondent\nhad frequently forced her to engage in numerous and\nvaried sexual acts with him. Ibid.\n2                 WHORTON v. BOCKTING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The next day, Laura Bockting confronted respondent\nand asked him to leave the house. He did so but denied\nany wrongdoing. Two days later, Laura called a rape\ncrisis hotline and brought Autumn to the hospital for an\nexamination. At the hospital, Detective Charles Zinovitch\nfrom the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sex\nual Assault Unit attempted to interview Autumn but\nfound her too distressed to discuss the assaults. Detective\nZinovitch then ordered a rape examination, which re\nvealed strong physical evidence of sexual assaults. See\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order in\nNevada v. Bockting, Case No. C\u201383110 (D. Nev., Sept. 5,\n1994); App. 47, 119.\n   Two days later, Detective Zinovitch interviewed Autumn\nin the presence of her mother, and at that time, Autumn\nprovided a detailed description of acts of sexual assault\ncarried out by respondent; Autumn also demonstrated\nthose acts using anatomically correct dolls. Id., at 47\u201348;\n119. Respondent was then arrested, and a state grand\njury indicted him on four counts of sexual assault on a\nminor under 14 years of age.\n   At respondent\u2019s preliminary hearing, Autumn testified\nthat she understood the difference between a truth and a\nlie, but she became upset when asked about the assaults.\nAlthough she initially agreed that respondent had touched\nher in a way that \u201c[she] didn\u2019t think he was supposed to\ntouch [her],\u201d id., at 14, she later stated that she could not\nremember how respondent had touched her or what she\nhad told her mother or the detective, id., at 19\u201321. The\ntrial court, however, found the testimony of Laura Bock\nting and Detective Zinovitch to be sufficient to hold re\nspondent for trial.\n   At trial, the court held a hearing outside the presence of\nthe jury to determine whether Autumn could testify. After\nit became apparent that Autumn was too distressed to be\nsworn in, id., at 25\u201326, the State moved under Nev. Rev.\n                      Cite as: 549 U.

App. 25\u201327. Under the Nevada\nstatute, out-of-court statements made by a child under 10\nyears of age describing acts of sexual assault or physical\nabuse of the child may be admitted if the court finds that\nthe child is unavailable or unable to testify and that \u201cthe\ntime, content and circumstances of the statement provide\nsufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d\n\u00a751.385(1)(a). Over defense counsel\u2019s objection that ad\nmission of this testimony would violate the Confrontation\nClause, id., at 27\u201328, the trial court found sufficient evi\ndence of reliability to satisfy \u00a751.385.\n   As a result of this ruling, Laura Bockting and Detective\nZinovitch were permitted at trial to recount Autumn\u2019s out-\nof-court statements about the assaults. Laura Bockting\nalso testified that respondent was the only male who had\nhad the opportunity to assault Autumn. In addition, the\nprosecution introduced evidence regarding Autumn\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Section  51.385 provides, in relevant part:\n   \u201c1. [A] statement made by a child under the age of 10 years describ\ning any act of sexual conduct performed with or on the child or any act\nof physical abuse of the child is admissible in a criminal proceeding\nregarding that act of sexual conduct or physical abuse if:\n   \u201c(a) The court finds, in a hearing out of the presence of the jury, that\nthe time, content and circumstances of the statement provide sufficient\ncircumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness; and\n   \u201c(b) The child testifies at the proceeding or is unavailable or unable to\ntestify.\n   \u201c2. In determining the trustworthiness of a statement, the court shall\nconsider, without limitation, whether:\n   \u201c(a) The statement was spontaneous;\n   \u201c(b) The child was subjected to repetitive questioning;\n   \u201c(c) The child had a motive to fabricate;\n   \u201c(d) The child used terminology unexpected of a child of similar age;\nand\n   \u201c(e) The child was in a stable mental state.\u201d\n4                     WHORTON v. BOCKTING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmedical exam. Respondent testified in his own defense\nand denied the assaults, and the defense brought out the\nfact that Autumn, unlike many children her age, had\nacquired some knowledge about sexual acts, since she had\nseen respondent and her mother engaging in sexual inter\ncourse and had become familiar with sexual terms. Id., at\n118.\n   The jury found respondent guilty of three counts of\nsexual assault on a minor under the age of 14, and the\ntrial court imposed two consecutive life sentences and\nanother concurrent life sentence.\n                               B\n   Respondent took an appeal to the Nevada Supreme\nCourt, which handed down its final decision in 1993, more\nthan a decade before Crawford.2 In analyzing respon\ndent\u2019s contention that the admission of Autumn\u2019s out-of\ncourt statements had violated his Confrontation Clause\nrights, the Nevada Supreme Court looked to Ohio v. Rob\nerts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), which was then the governing\nprecedent of this Court. See Bockting v. State, 109 Nev.\n103, 847 P. 2d 1364 (1993) (per curiam). Roberts had held\nthat the Confrontation Clause permitted the admission of\na hearsay statement made by a declarant who was un\navailable to testify if the statement bore sufficient indicia\nof reliability, either because the statement fell within a\nfirmly rooted hearsay exception or because there were\n\u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d relating to\nthe statement in question. 448 U. S., at 66. Applying\nRoberts, the Nevada Supreme Court held that the admis\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The State Supreme Court initially dismissed respondent\u2019s appeal in\n\n1989, Bockting v. State, 105 Nev. 1023, 810 P. 2d 317 (unpublished\ntable opinion), but we granted respondent\u2019s petition for a writ of certio\nrari and vacated and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of\nIdaho v.

S. ____ (2007)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsion of Autumn\u2019s statements was constitutional because\nthe circumstances surrounding the making of the state\nments provided particularized guarantees of trustworthi\nness. The Court cited the \u201cnatural spontaneity\u201d of Au\ntumn\u2019s initial statements to her mother, her reiteration of\nthe same account to Detective Zinovitch several days later,\nher use of anatomically correct dolls to demonstrate the\nassaults, and her detailed descriptions of sexual acts with\nwhich a 6-year-old would generally not be familiar. Bock\nting, supra, at 109\u2013112, 847 P. 2d, at 1368\u20131370.\n                             C\n   Respondent then filed a petition for a writ of habeas\ncorpus with the United States District Court for the Dis\ntrict of Nevada, arguing that the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision violated his Confrontation Clause rights. The\nDistrict Court denied the petition, holding that respondent\nwas not entitled to relief under the habeas statute, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d), because the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d and did not \u201cinvolv[e] an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.\u201d Order in Bockting v. Bayer, No. CV\u2013N\u201398\u20130764\u2013\nECR (Mar. 19, 2002), App. 69\u201370. Respondent then ap\npealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit.\n   While this appeal was pending, we issued our opinion in\nCrawford, in which we overruled Roberts and held that\n\u201c[t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial\u201d\nare admissible \u201conly where the declarant is unavailable,\nand only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity\nto cross-examine [the witness].\u201d 541 U. S., at 59. See also\nDavis v. Washington, 547 U. S. ___ (2006). We noted that\nthe outcome in Roberts\u2014as well as the outcome in all\nsimilar cases decided by this Court\u2014was consistent with\nthe rule announced in Crawford, but we concluded that\n6                 WHORTON v. BOCKTING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe interpretation of the Confrontation Clause set out in\nRoberts was unsound in several respects. See Crawford,\nsupra, at 60 (\u201cAlthough the results of our decisions have\ngenerally been faithful to the original meaning of the\nConfrontation Clause, the same cannot be said of our\nrationales\u201d). First, we observed that Roberts potentially\nexcluded too much testimony because it imposed Confron\ntation Clause restrictions on nontestimonial hearsay not\ngoverned by that Clause. 541 U. S., at 60. At the same\ntime, we noted, the Roberts test was too \u201cmalleable\u201d in\npermitting the admission of ex parte testimonial state\nments. 541 U. S., at 60. We concluded:\n       \u201cWhere testimonial statements are involved, we do\n    not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth\n    Amendment\u2019s protection to the vagaries of the rules of\n    evidence, much less to amorphous notions of \u2018reliabil\n    ity.\u2019 . . . Admitting statements deemed reliable by a\n    judge is fundamentally at odds with the right to con\n    frontation. To be sure, the Clause\u2019s ultimate goal is to\n    ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural\n    rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands\n    not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be\n    assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the cru\n    cible of cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a\n    judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable\n    evidence (a point on which there could be little dis\n    sent), but about how reliability can best be deter\n    mined.\u201d Id., at 61.\n                           D\n  On appeal from the denial of his petition for writ of\nhabeas corpus, respondent contended that if the rule in\nCrawford had been applied to his case, Autumn\u2019s out-of\ncourt statements could not have been admitted into evi\ndence and the jury would not have convicted him. Re\nspondent further argued that Crawford should have been\n                   Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\napplied to his case because the Crawford rule was either\n(1) an old rule in existence at the time of his conviction or\n(2) a \u201c \u2018watershed\u2019 \u201d rule that implicated \u201cthe fundamental\nfairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\u201d Saffle\nv. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 495 (1990) (quoting Teague, 489\nU. S., at 311 (plurality opinion)).\n   A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed the Dis\ntrict Court, holding that Crawford applies retroactively to\ncases on collateral review. Bockting v. Bayer, 399 F. 3d\n1010, as amended, 408 F. 3d 1127 (2005). In the panel\u2019s\nlead opinion, Judge McKeown concluded that Crawford\nannounced a new rule of criminal procedure, 399 F. 3d, at\n1014\u20131016, but that the decision was nevertheless retro\nactive on collateral review because it announced a water\nshed rule that \u201crework[ed] our understanding of bedrock\ncriminal procedure,\u201d id., at 1016.3 Judge Noonan con\ncurred, but his preferred analysis differed from Judge\nMcKeown\u2019s. Judge Noonan believed that Crawford did not\nannounce a new rule, 399 F. 3d, at 1022\u20131024, but \u201c[a]s an\nalternative to [this] analysis and in order to provide a\nprecedent for [the] court,\u201d he \u201calso concur[red] in Judge\nMcKeown\u2019s analysis and opinion,\u201d id., at 1024. Judge\nWallace, concurring and dissenting, agreed with Judge\nMcKeown that Crawford announced a new procedural rule\nbut arguing that Crawford did not rise to the level of a\nwatershed rule under this Court\u2019s jurisprudence. The\nNinth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, with nine judges\ndissenting. 418 F. 3d 1055 (2005).\n   The panel\u2019s decision that Crawford is retroactive to\ncases on collateral review conflicts with the decision of\nevery other Court of Appeals and State Supreme Court\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Judge McKeown then held respondent merited habeas corpus relief\nunder the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,\nbecause that statute incorporates our Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288\n(1989) retroactivity analysis. 399 F. 3d, at 1021\u20131022.\n8                     WHORTON v. BOCKTING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthat has addressed this issue.4 We granted certiorari to\nresolve this conflict. 547 U. S. ___ (2006).\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   In Teague and subsequent cases, we have laid out the\nframework to be used in determining whether a rule an\nnounced in one of our opinions should be applied retroac\ntively to judgments in criminal cases that are already final\non direct review. Under the Teague framework, an old\nrule applies both on direct and collateral review, but a new\nrule is generally applicable only to cases that are still on\ndirect review. See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314\n(1987). A new rule applies retroactively in a collateral\nproceeding only if (1) the rule is substantive or (2) the rule\nis a \u201c \u2018watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure\u2019 implicating\nthe fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal\nproceeding.\u201d Saffle, supra, at 495 (quoting Teague, supra,\nat 311 (plurality opinion)).\n                              B\n   In this case, it is undisputed that respondent\u2019s convic\ntion became final on direct appeal well before Crawford\nwas decided. We therefore turn to the question whether\nCrawford applied an old rule or announced a new one. A\nnew rule is defined as \u201ca rule that . . . was not \u2018dictated by\nprecedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See, e.g., Lave v. Dretke, 444 F. 3d 333 (CA5 2006); Espy v. Massac,\n\n443 F. 3d 1362 (CA11 2006); Murillo v. Frank, 402 F. 3d 786 (CA7\n2005); Dorchy v. Jones, 398 F. 3d 783 (CA6 2005); Brown v.

Crosby, 916 So. 2d 728 (Fla. 2005); In re Markel, 154 Wash.\n2d 262, 111 P. 3d 249 (2005).\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbecame final.\u2019 \u201d Saffle, supra, at 488 (quoting Teague,\nsupra, at 301 (plurality opinion); emphasis in original).\n  Applying this definition, it is clear that Crawford an\nnounced a new rule. The Crawford rule was not \u201cdictated\u201d\nby prior precedent. Quite the opposite is true: The Craw\nford rule is flatly inconsistent with the prior governing\nprecedent, Roberts, which Crawford overruled. See Davis,\n547 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at ___). \u201cThe explicit overruling\nof an earlier holding no doubt creates a new rule.\u201d Saffle,\nsupra, at 488.\n  In concluding that Crawford merely applied an old rule,\nJudge Noonan relied on our observation in Crawford that\nthe holdings in our prior decisions, including those that\napplied the Roberts rule, had been generally consistent\nwith the rule announced in Crawford (and with the Fram\ners\u2019 understanding of the meaning of the Confrontation\nClause, which provided the basis for the Crawford deci\nsion). See 541 U. S., at 57\u201359. But the Crawford Court\nwas quick to note that \u201cthe rationales\u201d of our prior deci\nsions had been inconsistent with the Crawford rule. Id.,\nat 60. \u201c \u2018The \u201cnew rule\u201d principle . . . validates reasonable,\ngood-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by\nstate courts even though they are shown to be contrary to\nlater decisions.\u2019 \u201d Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364, 372\u2013\n373 (1993) (quoting Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 414\n(1990)). And it is stating the obvious to say that, prior to\nCrawford, \u201creasonable jurists,\u201d Graham v. Collins, 506\nU. S. 461, 467 (1993), could have reached the conclusion\nthat the Roberts rule was the rule that governed the ad\nmission of hearsay statements made by an unavailable\ndeclarant.\n  Because the Crawford rule was not dictated by the\ngoverning precedent existing at the time when respon\ndent\u2019s conviction became final, the Crawford rule is a new\nrule.\n10                 WHORTON v. BOCKTING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   Because Crawford announced a \u201cnew rule\u201d and because\nit is clear and undisputed that the rule is procedural and\nnot substantive, that rule cannot be applied in this collat\neral attack on respondent\u2019s conviction unless it is a \u201c \u2018wa\ntershed rul[e] of criminal procedure\u2019 implicating the fun\ndamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal\nproceeding.\u201d Saffle, 494 U. S., at 495 (quoting Teague, 489\nU. S., at 311 (plurality opinion)). This exception is \u201cex\ntremely narrow,\u201d Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U. S. 348, 352\n(2004). We have observed that it is \u201c \u2018unlikely\u2019 \u201d that any\nsuch rules \u201c \u2018ha[ve] yet to emerge,\u2019 \u201d ibid. (quoting Tyler v.\nCain, 533 U. S. 656 (2001); internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also O\u2019Dell v. Netherland, 521 U. S. 151, 157\n(1997); Graham, supra, at 478; Teague, supra, at 313\n(plurality opinion). And in the years since Teague, we\nhave rejected every claim that a new rule satisfied the\nrequirements for watershed status. See, e.g., Summerlin,\nsupra (rejecting retroactivity for Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S.\n584 (2002)); Beard v. Banks, 542 U. S. 406 (2004) (reject\ning retroactivity for Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367\n(1988)); O\u2019Dell, supra (rejecting retroactivity for Simmons\nv. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994)); Gilmore v. Tay\nlor, 508 U. S. 333 (1993) (rejecting retroactivity for a new\nrule relating to jury instructions on homicide); Sawyer v.\nSmith, 497 U. S. 227 (1990) (rejecting retroactivity for\nCaldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985)).\n   In order to qualify as watershed, a new rule must meet\ntwo requirements. First, the rule must be necessary to\nprevent \u201can \u2018 \u201cimpermissibly large risk\u201d \u2019 \u201d of an inaccurate\nconviction. Summerlin, supra, at 356; see also Tyler, 533\nU. S., at 665. Second, the rule must \u201calter our under\nstanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to\nthe fairness of a proceeding.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks and emphasis omitted). We consider each of these\n                   Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)              11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirements in turn.\n                                   B\n    The Crawford rule does not satisfy the first requirement\nrelating to an impermissibly large risk of an inaccurate\nconviction. To be sure, the Crawford rule reflects the\nFramers\u2019 preferred mechanism (cross-examination) for\nensuring that inaccurate out-of-court testimonial state\nments are not used to convict an accused. But in order for\na new rule to meet the accuracy requirement at issue here,\n\u201c[i]t is . . . not enough . . . to say that [the] rule is aimed at\nimproving the accuracy of trial,\u201d Sawyer, 497 U. S., at 242\nor that the rule \u201cis directed toward the enhancement of\nreliability and accuracy in some sense,\u201d id., at 243. In\nstead, the question is whether the new rule remedied \u201can\n\u2018 \u201cimpermissibly large risk\u201d \u2019 \u201d of an inaccurate conviction.\nSummerlin, supra, at 366.\n    Guidance in answering this question is provided by\nGideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963), to which we\nhave repeatedly referred in discussing the meaning of the\nTeague exception at issue here. See, e.g., Beard, supra, at\n417; Saffle, supra, at 495; Gilmore, supra, at 364 (Black\nmun, J., dissenting). In Gideon, the only case that we\nhave identified as qualifying under this exception, the\nCourt held that counsel must be appointed for any indi\ngent defendant charged with a felony. When a defendant\nwho wishes to be represented by counsel is denied repre\nsentation, Gideon held, the risk of an unreliable verdict is\nintolerably high. See Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U. S. 162,\n166 (2002); United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658\u2013\n659 (1984); Gideon, supra, at 344\u2013345. The new rule\nannounced in Gideon eliminated this risk.\n    The Crawford rule is in no way comparable to the\nGideon rule. The Crawford rule is much more limited in\nscope, and the relationship of that rule to the accuracy of\nthe factfinding process is far less direct and profound.\n12                WHORTON v. BOCKTING\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nCrawford overruled Roberts because Roberts was inconsis\ntent with the original understanding of the meaning of the\nConfrontation Clause, not because the Court reached the\nconclusion that the overall effect of the Crawford rule\nwould be to improve the accuracy of fact finding in crimi\nnal trials. Indeed, in Crawford we recognized that even\nunder the Roberts rule, this Court had never specifically\napproved the introduction of testimonial hearsay state\nments. 542 U. S., at 57\u201360. Accordingly, it is not surpris\ning that the overall effect of Crawford with regard to the\naccuracy of fact-finding in criminal cases is not easy to\nassess.\n   With respect to testimonial out-of-court statements,\nCrawford is more restrictive than was Roberts, and this\nmay improve the accuracy of fact-finding in some criminal\ncases. Specifically, under Roberts, there may have been\ncases in which courts erroneously determined that testi\nmonial statements were reliable. But see 418 F. 3d, at\n1058 (O\u2019Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing\nen banc) (observing that it is unlikely that this occurred\n\u201cin anything but the exceptional case\u201d). But whatever\nimprovement in reliability Crawford produced in this\nrespect must be considered together with Crawford\u2019s\nelimination of Confrontation Clause protection against the\nadmission of unreliable out-of-court nontestimonial state\nments. Under Roberts, an out-of-court nontestimonial\nstatement not subject to prior cross-examination could not\nbe admitted without a judicial determination regarding\nreliability. Under Crawford, on the other hand, the Con\nfrontation Clause has no application to such statements\nand therefore permits their admission even if they lack\nindicia of reliability.\n   It is thus unclear whether Crawford, on the whole,\ndecreased or increased the number of unreliable out-of\ncourt statements that may be admitted in criminal trials.\nBut the question here is not whether Crawford resulted in\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsome net improvement in the accuracy of fact finding in\ncriminal cases. Rather, \u201cthe question is whether testi\nmony admissible under Roberts is so much more unreli\nable than that admissible under Crawford that the Craw\nford rule is \u2018 one without which the likelihood of an\naccurate conviction is seriously diminished.\u2019 \u201d 399 F. 3d, at\n1028 (Wallace, J., concurring and dissenting) (quoting\nSummerlin, 542 U. S., at 352 (internal quotation marks\nomitted; emphasis in original). Crawford did not effect a\nchange of this magnitude.\n                              C\n   The Crawford rule also did not \u201calter our understanding\nof the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fair\nness of a proceeding.\u201d Sawyer, supra, at 242 (internal\nquotations marks omitted and emphasis in original).\nContrary to the suggestion of the Court of Appeals, see\n399 F. 3d, at 1019 (relying on the conclusion that \u201cthe\nright of cross-examination as an adjunct to the constitu\ntional right of confrontation\u201d is a \u201cbedrock procedural\nrul[e]\u201d), this requirement cannot be met simply by show\ning that a new procedural rule is based on a \u201cbedrock\u201d\nright. We have frequently held that the Teague bar to\nretroactivity applies to new rules that are based on \u201cbed\nrock\u201d constitutional rights. See, e.g., Beard, 542 U. S., at\n418. Similarly, \u201c[t]hat a new procedural rule is \u2018funda\nmental\u2019 in some abstract sense is not enough.\u201d Summerlin,\n542 U. S., at 352.\n   Instead, in order to meet this requirement, a new rule\nmust itself constitute a previously unrecognized bedrock\nprocedural element that is essential to the fairness of a\nproceeding. In applying this requirement, we again have\nlooked to the example of Gideon, and \u201cwe have not hesi\ntated to hold that less sweeping and fundamental rules\u201d\ndo not qualify. Beard, supra, at 418.\n   In this case, it is apparent that the rule announced in\n14                WHORTON v. BOCKTING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCrawford, while certainly important, is not in the same\ncategory with Gideon. Gideon effected a profound and\n\u201c \u2018sweeping\u2019 \u201d change. Beard, supra, at 418 (quoting O\u2019Dell,\n521 U. S., at 167). The Crawford rule simply lacks the\n\u201cprimacy\u201d and \u201ccentrality\u201d of the Gideon rule, Saffle, 494\nU. S., at 495, and does not qualify as a rule that \u201calter[ed]\nour understanding of the bedrock procedural elements\nessential to the fairness of a proceeding,\u201d Sawyer, 497\nU. S., at 242 (internal quotation marks and emphasis\nomitted).\n                          IV\n  In sum, we hold that Crawford announced a \u201cnew rule\u201d\nof criminal procedure and that this rule does not fall\nwithin the Teague exception for watershed rules. We\ntherefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nand remand the case for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n",

One night, while respondent was at work, Autumn awoke from a dream crying, but she refused to tell her mother what was wrong, explaining: \"`[D]addy said you would make him leave and that he would beat my butt if I told you.'\" App. 119. After her mother reassured her, Autumn said that respondent had frequently forced her to engage in numerous and varied sexual acts with him. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The next day, Laura Bockting confronted respondent and asked him to leave the house. He did so but denied any wrongdoing. Two days later, Laura called a rape crisis hotline and brought Autumn to the hospital for an examination. At the hospital, Detective Charles Zinovitch from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sexual Assault Unit attempted to interview Autumn but found her too distressed to discuss the assaults. Detective Zinovitch then ordered a rape examination, which revealed strong physical evidence of sexual assaults. See Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order in <i>Nevada v.

Under the Nevada statute, out-of-court statements made by a child under 10 years of age describing acts of sexual assault or physical abuse of the child may be admitted if the court finds that the child is unavailable or unable to testify and that \"the time, content and circumstances of the statement provide sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\" \u00a7 51.385(1)(a). Over defense counsel's objection that admission of this testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause, <i>id.,</i> at 27-28, the trial court found sufficient evidence of reliability to satisfy \u00a7 51.385.</p>\n<p>As a result of this ruling, Laura Bockting and Detective Zinovitch were permitted at trial to recount Autumn's out-of-court statements about the assaults. Laura Bockting also testified that respondent was the only male who had had the opportunity to assault Autumn. In addition, the prosecution introduced evidence regarding Autumn's medical exam. Respondent testified in his own defense and denied the assaults, and the defense brought out the fact that Autumn, unlike many children her age, had acquired some knowledge about sexual acts, since she had seen respondent and her mother engaging in sexual intercourse and had become familiar with sexual terms. <i>Id.,</i> at 118.</p>\n<p>The jury found respondent guilty of three counts of sexual assault on a minor under the age of 14, and the trial court imposed two consecutive life sentences and another concurrent life sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondent took an appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court, which handed down its final decision in 1993, more than a decade before <i>Crawford.</i><sup>[2]</sup> In analyzing respondent's contention that the admission of Autumn's out-of-court statements had violated his Confrontation Clause rights, the Nevada Supreme Court looked to <i>Ohio v. Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), which was then the governing precedent of this Court. See <i>Bockting v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2614932\"><a href=\"/opinion/2614932/bockting-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Nev.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2614932\"><a href=\"/opinion/2614932/bockting-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span> (1993) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>. Roberts</i> had held that the Confrontation Clause permitted the admission of a hearsay statement made by a declarant who was unavailable to testify if the statement bore sufficient indicia of reliability, either because the statement fell within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or because there were \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\" relating to the statement in question. 448 U.S., at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. Applying <i>Roberts,</i> the Nevada Supreme Court held that the admission of Autumn's statements was constitutional because the circumstances surrounding the making of the statements provided particularized guarantees of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1179</span> trustworthiness. The Court cited the \"natural spontaneity\" of Autumn's initial statements to her mother, her reiteration of the same account to Detective Zinovitch several days later, her use of anatomically correct dolls to demonstrate the assaults, and her detailed descriptions of sexual acts with which a 6-year-old would generally not be familiar. <i>Bockting, supra,</i> at 109-112, 847 P.2d, at 1368-1370.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Respondent then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, arguing that the Nevada Supreme Court's decision violated his Confrontation Clause rights. The District Court denied the petition, holding that respondent was not entitled to relief under the habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), because the Nevada Supreme Court's decision was not \"contrary to\" and did not \"involv[e] an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" Order in <i>Bockting v. Bayer,</i> No. CV-N-98-0764-ECR (Mar. 19, 2002), App. 69-70. Respondent then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p>While this appeal was pending, we issued our opinion in <i>Crawford,</i> in which we overruled <i>Roberts</i> and held that \"[t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial\" are admissible \"only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine [the witness].\" 541 U.S., at 59, 124 S.Ct. 1354. See also <i>Davis v. Washington,</i> 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006). We noted that the outcome in <i>Roberts</i>\u0097as well as the outcome in all similar cases decided by this Court\u0097was consistent with the rule announced in <i>Crawford,</i> but we concluded that the interpretation of the Confrontation Clause set out in <i>Roberts</i> was unsound in several respects. See <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 60, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (\"Although the results of our decisions have generally been faithful to the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause, the same cannot be said of our rationales\"). First, we observed that <i>Roberts</i> potentially excluded too much testimony because it imposed Confrontation Clause restrictions on nontestimonial hearsay not governed by that Clause. 541 U.S., at 60, 124 S.Ct. 1354. At the same time, we noted, the <i>Roberts</i> test was too \"malleable\" in permitting the admission of <i>ex parte</i> testimonial statements. 541 U.S., at 60, 124 S.Ct. 1354. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Where testimonial statements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment's protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much less to amorphous notions of `reliability.' ... Admitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right to confrontation. To be sure, the Clause's ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 61, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>On appeal from the denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus, respondent contended that if the rule in <i>Crawford</i> had been applied to his case, Autumn's out-of-court statements could not have been admitted into evidence and the jury would not have convicted him. Respondent further <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1180</span> argued that <i>Crawford</i> should have been applied to his case because the <i>Crawford</i> rule was either (1) an old rule in existence at the time of his conviction or (2) a \"`watershed'\" rule that implicated \"the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\" <i>Saffle v.

Bayer,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></span>, as amended, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1127</span></span> (2005). In the panel's lead opinion, Judge McKeown concluded that <i>Crawford</i> announced a new rule of criminal procedure, 399 F.3d, at 1014-1016, but that the decision was nevertheless retroactive on collateral review because it announced a watershed rule that \"rework[ed] our understanding of bedrock criminal procedure,\" <i>id.,</i> at 1016.<sup>[3]</sup> Judge Noonan concurred, but his preferred analysis differed from Judge McKeown's. Judge Noonan believed that <i>Crawford</i> did not announce a new rule, 399 F.3d, at 1022-1024, but \"[a]s an alternative to [this] analysis and in order to provide a precedent for [the] court,\" he \"also concur[red] in Judge McKeown's analysis and opinion,\" <i>id.,</i> at 1024. Judge Wallace, concurring and dissenting, agreed with Judge McKeown that <i>Crawford</i> announced a new procedural rule but arguing that <i>Crawford</i> did not rise to the level of a watershed rule under this Court's jurisprudence. The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, with nine judges dissenting. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791444\"><a href=\"/opinion/791444/marvin-howard-bockting-v-robert-bayer/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1055</span></a></span> (2005).</p>\n<p>The panel's decision that <i>Crawford</i> is retroactive to cases on collateral review conflicts with the decision of every other Court of Appeals and State Supreme Court that has addressed this issue.<sup>[4]</sup> We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2017, 164 L.Ed.2d 778 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In <i>Teague</i> and subsequent cases, we have laid out the framework to be used in determining whether a rule announced in one of our opinions should be applied retroactively to judgments in criminal cases that are already final on direct review. Under the <i>Teague</i> framework, an old rule applies both on direct and collateral review, but a new rule is generally applicable only to cases that are still on direct review. See <i>Griffith v. Kentucky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111785\"><a href=\"/opinion/111785/griffith-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987). A new rule applies retroactively in a collateral proceeding only if (1) the rule is substantive or (2) the rule is a \"`watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\" <i>Saffle, supra,</i> at 495, 110 S.Ct. 1257 (quoting <i>Teague,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1181</span> <i>supra,</i> at 311, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In this case, it is undisputed that respondent's conviction became final on direct appeal well before <i>Crawford</i> was decided. We therefore turn to the question whether <i>Crawford</i> applied an old rule or announced a new one. A new rule is defined as \"a rule that ... was not `<i>dictated</i> by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final.'\" <i>Saffle, supra,</i> at 488, 110 S.Ct. 1257 (quoting <i>Teague, supra,</i> at 301, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion); emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>Applying this definition, it is clear that <i>Crawford</i> announced a new rule. The <i>Crawford</i> rule was not \"dictated\" by prior precedent. Quite the opposite is true: The <i>Crawford</i> rule is flatly inconsistent with the prior governing precedent, <i>Roberts,</i> which <i>Crawford</i> overruled. See <i>Davis,</i> 547 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2266. \"The explicit overruling of an earlier holding no doubt creates a new rule.\" <i>Saffle, supra,</i> at 488, 110 S.Ct. 1257.</p>\n<p>In concluding that <i>Crawford</i> merely applied an old rule, Judge Noonan relied on our observation in <i>Crawford</i> that the holdings in our prior decisions, including those that applied the <i>Roberts</i> rule, had been generally consistent with the rule announced in <i>Crawford</i> (and with the Framers' understanding of the meaning of the Confrontation Clause, which provided the basis for the <i>Crawford</i> decision). See 541 U.S., at 57-59, 124 S.Ct. 1354. But the <i>Crawford</i> Court was quick to note that \"the rationales\" of our prior decisions had been inconsistent with the <i>Crawford</i> rule. <i>Id.,</i> at 60, 124 S.Ct. 1354. \"`The \"new rule\" principle ... validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts even though they are shown to be contrary to later decisions.'\" <i>Lockhart v.

First, the rule must be necessary to prevent \"an `\"impermissibly large risk\"'\" of an inaccurate conviction. <i>Summerlin, supra,</i> at 356, 124 S.Ct. 2519; see also <i>Tyler,</i> 533 U.S., at 665, 121 S.Ct. 2478. Second, the rule must \"alter our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). We consider each of these requirements in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The <i>Crawford</i> rule does not satisfy the first requirement relating to an impermissibly large risk of an inaccurate conviction. To be sure, the <i>Crawford</i> rule reflects the Framers' preferred mechanism (cross-examination) for ensuring that inaccurate out-of-court testimonial statements are not used to convict an accused. But in order for a new rule to meet the accuracy requirement at issue here, \"[i]t is ... not enough ... to say that [the] rule is aimed at improving the accuracy of trial,\" <i>Sawyer,</i> 497 U.S., at 242, 110 S.Ct. 2822 or that the rule \"is directed toward the enhancement of reliability and accuracy in some sense,\" <i>id.,</i> at 243, 110 S.Ct. 2822. Instead, the question is whether the new rule remedied \"an `\"impermissibly large risk\"'\" of an inaccurate conviction. <i>Summerlin, supra,</i> at 366, 124 S.Ct. 2519.</p>\n<p>Guidance in answering this question is provided by <i>Gideon v. Wainwright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106545\"><a href=\"/opinion/106545/gideon-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), to which we have repeatedly referred in discussing the meaning of the <i>Teague</i> exception at issue here. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Beard, supra,</i> at 417, 124 S.Ct. 2504; <i>Saffle, supra,</i> at 495, 110 S.Ct. 1257; <i>Gilmore, supra,</i> at 364, 113 S.Ct. 2112 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). In <i>Gideon,</i> the only case that we have identified as qualifying under this exception, the Court held that counsel must be appointed for any indigent defendant charged with a felony. When a defendant who wishes to be represented by counsel is denied representation, <i>Gideon</i> held, the risk of an unreliable verdict is intolerably high. See <i>Mickens v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 166, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002); <i>United States v. Cronic,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111169\"><a href=\"/opinion/111169/united-states-v-cronic/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span>, 658-659, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984); <i>Gideon, supra,</i> at 344-345, 83 S.Ct. 792. The new rule announced in <i>Gideon</i> eliminated this risk.</p>\n<p>The <i>Crawford</i> rule is in no way comparable to the <i>Gideon</i> rule. The <i>Crawford</i> rule is much more limited in scope, and the relationship of that rule to the accuracy of the factfinding process is far less direct and profound. <i>Crawford</i> overruled <i>Roberts</i> because <i>Roberts</i> was inconsistent with the original understanding of the meaning of the Confrontation Clause, not because the Court reached the conclusion that the overall effect of the <i>Crawford</i> rule would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1183</span> be to improve the accuracy of fact finding in criminal trials. Indeed, in <i>Crawford</i> we recognized that even under the <i>Roberts</i> rule, this Court had never specifically approved the introduction of testimonial hearsay statements. 542 U.S., at 57-60, 124 S.Ct. 2373. Accordingly, it is not surprising that the overall effect of <i>Crawford</i> with regard to the accuracy of fact-finding in criminal cases is not easy to assess.</p>\n<p>With respect to <i>testimonial</i> out-of-court statements, <i>Crawford</i> is more restrictive than was <i>Roberts,</i> and this may improve the accuracy of fact-finding in some criminal cases. Specifically, under <i>Roberts,</i> there may have been cases in which courts erroneously determined that testimonial statements were reliable. But see 418 F.3d, at 1058 (O'Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (observing that it is unlikely that this occurred \"in anything but the exceptional case\"). But whatever improvement in reliability <i>Crawford</i> produced in this respect must be considered together with <i>Crawford's</i> elimination of Confrontation Clause protection against the admission of unreliable out-of-court nontestimonial statements. Under <i>Roberts,</i> an out-of-court nontestimonial statement not subject to prior cross-examination could not be admitted without a judicial determination regarding reliability. Under <i>Crawford,</i> on the other hand, the Confrontation Clause has no application to such statements and therefore permits their admission even if they lack indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p>It is thus unclear whether <i>Crawford,</i> on the whole, decreased or increased the number of unreliable out-of-court statements that may be admitted in criminal trials. But the question here is not whether <i>Crawford</i> resulted in some net improvement in the accuracy of fact finding in criminal cases. Rather, \"the question is whether testimony admissible under <i>Roberts</i> is so much more unreliable than that admissible under <i>Crawford</i> that the <i>Crawford</i> rule is `one without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is <i>seriously</i> diminished.'\" 399 F.3d, at 1028 (Wallace, J., concurring and dissenting) (quoting <i>Summerlin,</i> 542 U.S., at 352, 124 S.Ct. 2519) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). <i>Crawford</i> did not effect a change of this magnitude.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The <i>Crawford</i> rule also did not \"alter our understanding of the <i>bedrock procedural elements</i> essential to the fairness of a proceeding.\" <i>Sawyer, supra,</i> at 242, 110 S.Ct. 2822 (internal quotations marks omitted and emphasis in original). Contrary to the suggestion of the Court of Appeals, see 399 F.3d, at 1019 (relying on the conclusion that \"the right of cross-examination as an adjunct to the constitutional right of confrontation\" is a \"bedrock procedural rul[e]\"), this requirement cannot be met simply by showing that a new procedural rule is <i>based on</i> a \"bedrock\" right. We have frequently held that the <i>Teague</i> bar to retroactivity applies to new rules that are based on \"bedrock\" constitutional rights. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Beard,</i> 542 U.S., at 418, 124 S.Ct. 2504. Similarly, \"[t]hat a new procedural rule is `fundamental' in some abstract sense is not enough.\" <i>Summerlin,</i> 542 U.S., at 352, 124 S.Ct. 2519.</p>\n<p>Instead, in order to meet this requirement, a new rule must itself constitute a previously unrecognized bedrock procedural element that is essential to the fairness of a proceeding. In applying this requirement, we again have looked to the example of <i>Gideon,</i> and \"we have not hesitated to hold that less sweeping and fundamental rules\" do not qualify. <i>Beard, supra,</i> at 418, 124 S.Ct. 2504.</p>\n<p>In this case, it is apparent that the rule announced in <i>Crawford,</i> while certainly important, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1184</span> is not in the same category with <i>Gideon. Gideon</i> effected a profound and \"`sweeping'\" change. <i>Beard, supra,</i> at 418, 124 S.Ct. 2504 (quoting <i>O'Dell,</i> 521 U.S., at 167, 117 S.Ct. 1969). The <i>Crawford</i> rule simply lacks the \"primacy\" and \"centrality\" of the <i>Gideon</i> rule, <i>Saffle,</i> 494 U.S., at 495, 110 S.Ct. 1257, and does not qualify as a rule that \"alter[ed] our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding,\" <i>Sawyer,</i> 497 U.S., at 242, 110 S.Ct. 2822 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>In sum, we hold that <i>Crawford</i> announced a \"new rule\" of criminal procedure and that this rule does not fall within the <i>Teague</i> exception for watershed rules. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 51.385 provides, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>\"1. [A] statement made by a child under the age of 10 years describing any act of sexual conduct performed with or on the child or any act of physical abuse of the child is admissible in a criminal proceeding regarding that act of sexual conduct or physical abuse if:</p>\n<p>\"(a) The court finds, in a hearing out of the presence of the jury, that the time, content and circumstances of the statement provide sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness; and</p>\n<p>\"(b) The child testifies at the proceeding or is unavailable or unable to testify.</p>\n<p>\"2. In determining the trustworthiness of a statement, the court shall consider, without limitation, whether:</p>\n<p>\"(a) The statement was spontaneous;</p>\n<p>\"(b) The child was subjected to repetitive questioning;</p>\n<p>\"(c) The child had a motive to fabricate;</p>\n<p>\"(d) The child used terminology unexpected of a child of similar age; and</p>\n<p>\"(e) The child was in a stable mental state.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The State Supreme Court initially dismissed respondent's appeal in 1989, <i>Bockting v.
