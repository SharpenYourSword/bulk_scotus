Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, seeking damages for an arrest that violated the Fourth Amendment. We decide whether his suit is timely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On January 17, 1994, John Handy was shot to death in the city of Chicago. Sometime around 8 p.m. two days later, Chicago police officers located petitioner, then 15 years of age, and transported him to a police station for questioning. After interrogations that lasted into the early morning hours the next day, petitioner agreed to confess to Handy's murder. An assistant state's attorney prepared a statement to this effect, and petitioner signed it, at the same time waiving his <i>Miranda</i> rights.</p>\n<p>Prior to trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County, petitioner unsuccessfully attempted to suppress his station house statements as the product of an unlawful arrest. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 26 years in prison. On direct appeal, the Appellate Court of Illinois held that officers had arrested petitioner without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. <i>People v. Wallace,</i> 299 Ill.App.3d 9, 17-18, 233 Ill. Dec. 444, 701 N.E.2d 87, 94 (1998). According to that court (whose determination we are not reviewing here), even assuming petitioner willingly accompanied police to the station, his presence there \"escalated to an involuntary seizure prior to his formal arrest.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18, 233 Ill.Dec. 444, 701 N.E.2d, at 94. After another round of appeals, the Appellate Court concluded on August 31, 2001, that the effect of petitioner's illegal arrest had not been sufficiently attenuated to render his statements admissible, see <i>Brown v. Illinois,</i> 422 U.S. 590, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975), and remanded for a new trial. Judgt. order reported <i>sub nom. People v. Wallace,</i> 324 Ill.App.3d 1139, 282 Ill.Dec. 137, 805 N.E.2d 756 (2001). On April 10, 2002, prosecutors dropped the charges against petitioner.</p>\n<p>On April 2, 2003, petitioner filed this \u00a7 1983 suit against the city of Chicago and several Chicago police officers, seeking damages arising from, <i>inter alia,</i> his unlawful arrest.<sup>[1]</sup> The District Court granted summary judgment to respondents and the Court of Appeals affirmed. According to the Seventh Circuit, petitioner's \u00a7 1983 suit was time barred because his cause of action accrued at the time of his arrest, and not when his conviction was later set aside. <i>Wallace v. Chicago,</i> 440 F.3d 421, 427 (2006). We granted certiorari, 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2891, 165 L.Ed.2d 915 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Section 1983 provides a federal cause of action, but in several respects relevant here federal law looks to the law of the State in which the cause of action arose. This is so for the length of the statute of limitations: It is that which the State provides for personal-injury torts. <i>Owens v. Okure,</i> 488 U.S. 235, 249-250, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989); <i>Wilson v. Garcia,</i> 471 U.S. 261, 279-280, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1095</span> The parties agree that under Illinois law, this period is two years. Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 735, \u00a7 5/13-202 (West 2003). Thus, if the statute on petitioner's cause of action began to run at the time of his unlawful arrest, or even at the time he was ordered held by a magistrate, his \u00a7 1983 suit was plainly dilatory, even according him tolling for the two-plus years of his minority, see \u00a7 5/13-211. But if, as the dissenting judge argued below, the commencement date for running of the statute is governed by this Court's decision in <i>Heck v. Humphrey,</i> 512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), that date <i>may</i> be the date on which petitioner's conviction was vacated, in which case the \u00a7 1983 suit would have been timely filed.</p>\n<p>While we have never stated so expressly, the accrual date of a \u00a7 1983 cause of action is a question of federal law that is <i>not</i> resolved by reference to state law. The parties agree, the Seventh Circuit in this case so held, see 440 F.3d, at 424, and we are aware of no federal court of appeals holding to the contrary. Aspects of \u00a7 1983 which are not governed by reference to state law are governed by federal rules conforming in general to common-law tort principles. See <i>Heck, supra,</i> at 483, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <i>Carey v. Piphus,</i> 435 U.S. 247, 257-258, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978). Under those principles, it is \"the standard rule that [accrual occurs] when the plaintiff has `a complete and present cause of action.'\" <i>Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal.,</i> 522 U.S. 192, 201, 118 S.Ct. 542, 139 L.Ed.2d 553 (1997) (quoting <i>Rawlings v. Ray,</i> 312 U.S. 96, 98, 61 S.Ct. 473, 85 L.Ed. 605 (1941)), that is, when \"the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief,\" <i>Bay Area Laundry, supra,</i> at 201, 118 S.Ct. 542. There can be no dispute that petitioner could have filed suit as soon as the allegedly wrongful arrest occurred, subjecting him to the harm of involuntary detention, so the statute of limitations would normally commence to run from that date.</p>\n<p>There is, however, a refinement to be considered, arising from the common law's distinctive treatment of the torts of false arrest and false imprisonment, \"[t]he. . . cause[s] of action [that] provid[e] the closest analogy to claims of the type considered here,\" <i>Heck, supra,</i> at 484, 114 S.Ct. 2364. See 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Torts \u00a7 47, p. 88 (2001). False arrest and false imprisonment overlap; the former is a species of the latter. \"Every confinement of the person is an imprisonment, whether it be in a common prison or in a private house, or in the stocks, or even by forcibly detaining one in the public streets; and when a man is lawfully in a house, it is imprisonment to prevent him from leaving the room in which he is.\" M. Newell, Law of Malicious Prosecution, False Imprisonment, and Abuse of Legal Process \u00a7 2, p. 57 (1892) (footnotes omitted). See also 7 S. Speiser, C. Krause, &amp; A. Gans, American Law of Torts \u00a7 27:2, pp. 940-942 (1990). We shall thus refer to the two torts together as false imprisonment. That tort provides the proper analogy to the cause of action asserted against the present respondents for the following reason: The sort of unlawful detention remediable by the tort of false imprisonment is detention <i>without legal process,</i> see, <i>e.g.,</i> W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7 11, p. 54, \u00a7 119, pp. 885-886 (5th ed.1984); 7 Speiser, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 27:2, at 943-944, and the allegations before us arise from respondents' detention of petitioner <i>without legal process</i> in January 1994. They did not have a warrant for his arrest.</p>\n<p>The running of the statute of limitations on false imprisonment is subject to a distinctive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1096</span> rule\u0097dictated, perhaps, by the reality that the victim may not be able to sue while he is still imprisoned: \"Limitations begin to run against an action for false imprisonment when the alleged false imprisonment ends.\" 2 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions \u00a7 187d(4), p. 878 (4th rev. ed.1916); see also 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 899, Comment <i>c</i> (1977); A. Underhill, Principles of Law of Torts 202 (1881). Thus, to determine the beginning of the limitations period in this case, we must determine when petitioner's false imprisonment came to an end.</p>\n<p>Reflective of the fact that false imprisonment consists of detention without legal process, a false imprisonment ends once the victim becomes held <i>pursuant to such process</i>\u0097when, for example, he is bound over by a magistrate or arraigned on charges. Dobbs, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 39, at 74, n. 2; Keeton, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 119, at 888; H. Stephen, Actions for Malicious Prosecution 120-123 (1888). Thereafter, unlawful detention forms part of the damages for the \"entirely distinct\" tort of malicious prosecution, which remedies detention accompanied, not by absence of legal process, but by <i>wrongful institution</i> of legal process.<sup>[2]</sup> Keeton, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 119, at 885-886; see 1 F. Harper, F. James, &amp; O. Gray, Law of Torts \u00a7 3.9, p. 3:36 (3d ed.1996); 7 Speiser, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 27:2, at 943-945. \"If there is a false arrest claim, damages for that claim cover the time of detention up until issuance of process or arraignment, but not more. From that point on, any damages recoverable must be based on a malicious prosecution claim and on the wrongful use of judicial process rather than detention itself.\" Keeton, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 119, at 888; see also <i>Heck, supra,</i> at 484, 114 S.Ct. 2364; 8 Speiser, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 28:15, at 80. Thus, petitioner's contention that his false imprisonment ended upon his release from custody, after the State dropped the charges against him, must be rejected. It ended much earlier, when legal process was initiated against him, and the statute would have begun to run from that date, but for its tolling by reason of petitioner's minority.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Petitioner asserts that the date of his release from custody must be the relevant date in the circumstances of the present suit, since he is seeking damages up to that time. The theory of his complaint is that the initial Fourth Amendment violation set the wheels in motion for his subsequent conviction and detention: The unlawful arrest led to the coerced confession, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1097</span> which was introduced at his trial, producing his conviction and incarceration. As we have just explained, at common law damages for detention after issuance of process or arraignment would be attributable to a tort other than the unlawful arrest alleged in petitioner's complaint\u0097and probably a tort chargeable to defendants other than the respondents here. Even assuming, however, that all damages for detention pursuant to legal process could be regarded as consequential damages attributable to the unlawful arrest, that would not alter the commencement date for the statute of limitations. \"Under the traditional rule of accrual . . . the tort cause of action accrues, and the statute of limitations commences to run, when the wrongful act or omission results in damages. The cause of action accrues even though the full extent of the injury is not then known or predictable.\" 1 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions \u00a7 7.4.1, pp. 526-527 (1991) (footnotes omitted); see also 54 C.J.S., Limitations of Actions \u00a7 112, p. 150 (2005). Were it otherwise, the statute would begin to run only after a plaintiff became satisfied that he had been harmed enough, placing the supposed statute of repose in the sole hands of the party seeking relief.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the statute of limitations on petitioner's \u00a7 1983 claim commenced to run when he appeared before the examining magistrate and was bound over for trial. Since more than two years elapsed between that date and the filing of this suit\u0097even leaving out of the count the period before he reached his majority\u0097the action was time barred.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>This would end the matter, were it not for petitioner's contention that <i>Heck v. Humphrey,</i> 512 U.S., at 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, compels the conclusion that his suit could not accrue until the State dropped its charges against him. In <i>Heck,</i> a state prisoner filed suit under \u00a7 1983 raising claims which, if true, would have established the invalidity of his outstanding conviction. We analogized his suit to one for malicious prosecution, an element of which is the favorable termination of criminal proceedings. <i>Id.,</i> at 484, 114 S.Ct. 2364. We said:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[I]n order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has <i>not</i> been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 486-487[, 114 S.Ct. 2364] (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>We rested this conclusion upon \"the hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 486, 114 S.Ct. 2364. \"`Congress,'\" we said, \"`has determined that habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or length of their confinement, and that specific determination must override the general terms of \u00a7 1983.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 482, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (quoting <i>Preiser v. Rodriguez,</i> 411 U.S. 475, 490, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973)).</p>\n<p>As the above excerpts show, the <i>Heck</i> rule for deferred accrual is called into play only when there exists \"a conviction or sentence that has <i>not</i> been . . . invalidated,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1098</span> that is to say, an \"outstanding criminal judgment.\" It delays what would otherwise be the accrual date of a tort action until the setting aside <i>of an extant conviction</i> which success in that tort action would impugn. We assume that, for purposes of the present tort action, the <i>Heck</i> principle would be applied not to the date of accrual but to the date on which the statute of limitations began to run, that is, the date petitioner became held pursuant to legal process. See <i>supra,</i> at 1095-1096. Even at that later time, there was in existence no criminal conviction that the cause of action would impugn; indeed, there may not even have been an indictment.</p>\n<p>What petitioner seeks, in other words, is the adoption of a principle that goes well beyond <i>Heck:</i> that an action which would impugn <i>an anticipated future conviction</i> cannot be brought until that conviction occurs and is set aside. The impracticality of such a rule should be obvious. In an action for false arrest it would require the plaintiff (and if he brings suit promptly, the court) to speculate about whether a prosecution will be brought, whether it will result in conviction, and whether the pending civil action will impugn that verdict, see <i>Heck,</i> 512 U.S., at 487, n. 7, 114 S.Ct. 2364 \u0097 all this at a time when it can hardly be known what evidence the prosecution has in its possession. And what if the plaintiff (or the court) guesses wrong, and the anticipated future conviction never occurs, because of acquittal or dismissal? Does that event (instead of the <i>Heck</i>-required setting aside of the extant conviction) trigger accrual of the cause of action? Or what if prosecution never occurs\u0097what will the trigger be then?</p>\n<p>We are not disposed to embrace this bizarre extension of <i>Heck.</i> If a plaintiff files a false arrest claim before he has been convicted (or files any other claim related to rulings that will likely be made in a pending or anticipated criminal trial), it is within the power of the district court, and in accord with common practice, to stay the civil action until the criminal case or the likelihood of a criminal case is ended. See <i>id.,</i> at 487-488, n. 8, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (noting that \"abstention may be an appropriate response to the parallel state-court proceedings\"); <i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 517 U.S. 706, 730, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996). If the plaintiff is ultimately convicted, and if the stayed civil suit would impugn that conviction, <i>Heck</i> will require dismissal; otherwise, the civil action will proceed, absent some other bar to suit. <i>Edwards v. Balisok,</i> 520 U.S. 641, 649, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <i>Heck,</i> 512 U.S., at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p>There is, however, one complication that we must address here. It arises from the fact that \u00a7 1983 actions, unlike the tort of malicious prosecution which <i>Heck</i> took as its model, see <i>id.,</i> at 484, 114 S.Ct. 2364, sometimes accrue before the setting aside of\u0097indeed, even before the existence of\u0097 the related criminal conviction. That of course is the case here, and it raises the question whether, assuming that the <i>Heck</i> bar takes effect when the later conviction is obtained, the statute of limitations on the once valid cause of action is tolled as long as the <i>Heck</i> bar subsists. In the context of the present case: If petitioner's conviction on April 19, 1996, caused the statute of limitations on his (possibly) impugning but yet-to-be-filed cause of action to be tolled until that conviction was set aside, his filing here would have been timely.</p>\n<p>We have generally referred to state law for tolling rules, just as we have for the length of statutes of limitation. <i>Hardin v. Straub,</i> 490 U.S. 536, 538-539, 109 S.Ct. 1998, 104 L.Ed.2d 582 (1989); <i>Board</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1099</span> <i>of Regents of Univ. of State of N.Y. v. Tomanio,</i> 446 U.S. 478, 484-486, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980). Petitioner has not brought to our attention, nor are we aware of, Illinois cases providing tolling in even remotely comparable circumstances. (Indeed, petitioner did not even argue for such tolling below, though he supported its suggestion at oral argument.) Nor would we be inclined to adopt a federal tolling rule to this effect. Under such a regime, it would not be known whether tolling is appropriate by reason of the <i>Heck</i> bar until it is established that the newly entered conviction would be impugned by the not-yet-filed, and thus utterly indeterminate, \u00a7 1983 claim.<sup>[4]</sup> It would hardly be desirable to place the question of tolling <i>vel non</i> in this jurisprudential limbo, leaving it to be determined by those later events, and then pronouncing it retroactively. Defendants need to be on notice to preserve beyond the normal limitations period evidence that will be needed for their defense; and a statute that becomes retroactively extended, by the action of the plaintiff in crafting a conviction-impugning cause of action, is hardly a statute of repose.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Justice BREYER argues in dissent that equitable tolling should apply \"so long as the issues that [a \u00a7 1983] claim would raise are being pursued in state court.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1104. We know of no support (nor <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1100</span> does the dissent suggest any) for the far-reaching proposition that equitable tolling is appropriate to avoid the risk of concurrent litigation. As best we can tell, the only rationale for such a rule is the concern that \"petitioner would have had to divide his attention between criminal and civil cases.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1102. But when has it been the law that a criminal defendant, or a potential criminal defendant, is absolved from all other responsibilities that the law would otherwise place upon him? If a defendant has a breach-of-contract claim against the prime contractor for his new home, is he entitled to tolling for that as well while his criminal case is pending? Equitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual circumstances, not a cure-all for an entirely common state of affairs. Besides its never-heard-of-before quality, the dissent's proposal suffers from a more ironic flaw. Although the dissent criticizes us for having to develop a system of stays and dismissals, it should be obvious that the omnibus tolling solution will require the same. Despite the existence of the new tolling rule, some (if not most) plaintiffs will nevertheless file suit before or during state criminal proceedings. How does the dissent propose to handle such suits? Finally, the dissent's contention that law enforcement officers would prefer the possibility of a later \u00a7 1983 suit to the more likely reality of an immediate filing, <i>post</i> at 1104, is both implausible and contradicted by those who know best. As no fewer than 11 States have informed us in this litigation, \"States and municipalities have a strong interest in timely notice of alleged misconduct by their agents.\" Brief for State of Illinois et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 18.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We hold that the statute of limitations upon a \u00a7 1983 claim seeking damages for a false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, where the arrest is followed by criminal proceedings, begins to run at the time the claimant becomes detained pursuant to legal process. Since in the present case this occurred (with appropriate tolling for the plaintiff's minority) more than two years before the complaint was filed, the suit was out of time. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice SOUTER joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>While I do not disagree with the Court's conclusion, I reach it by a more direct route. The alleged Fourth Amendment violation at issue in this case had two distinct consequences for petitioner: First, it provided him with a federal cause of action for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and second, it provided him with an objection to the admissibility of certain evidence in his state criminal trial. The crux of petitioner's argument before this Court is that <i>Heck v. Humphrey,</i> 512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), provides the appropriate rule of accrual for his \u00a7 1983 claim. As both he and the majority note, <i>Heck</i> held that</p>\n<blockquote>\"in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. . . . Thus, when a state prisoner seeks damages in a \u00a7 1983 suit, the district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1101</span> plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 486-487[, 114 S.Ct. 2364] (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Relying on this principle, petitioner contends that his federal cause of action did not accrue until after the criminal charges against him were dropped.</p>\n<p>Unlike the majority, my analysis would not depend on any common-law tort analogies.<sup>[1]</sup> Instead, I would begin where all nine Justices began in <i>Heck.</i> That case, we unanimously agreed, required the Court to reconcile \u00a7 1983 with the federal habeas corpus statute.<sup>[2]</sup> In concluding that Heck's damages claim was not cognizable under \u00a7 1983, we found that the writ of habeas corpus, and not \u00a7 1983, affords the \"`appropriate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or length of their confinement.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 482, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (quoting <i>Preiser v. Rodriguez,</i> 411 U.S. 475, 490, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973)). Given our holding in <i>Stone v. Powell,</i> 428 U.S. 465, 481-482, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), however, that writ cannot provide a remedy for this petitioner. And because a habeas remedy was never available to him in the first place, <i>Heck</i> cannot postpone the accrual of petitioner's \u00a7 1983 Fourth Amendment claim.<sup>[3]</sup> So while it may well be appropriate to stay the trial of claims of this kind until after the completion of state proceedings, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 517 U.S. 706, 731, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996); cf. <i>Younger v. Harris,</i> 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), I am aware of no legal basis for holding that the cause of action has not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1102</span> accrued once the Fourth Amendment violation has been completed.</p>\n<p>The Court regrettably lets the perfect become the enemy of the good. It eschews my reasoning because \"[f]ederal habeas petitioners have <i>sometimes</i> succeeded in arguing that <i>Stone's</i> general prohibition does not apply.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1099, n. 5 (emphasis added). However, in the vast run of cases, a State will provide a habeas petitioner with \"an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim,\" <i>Stone,</i> 428 U.S., at 482, 96 S.Ct. 3037, and <i>Heck</i> will not apply. It is always possible to find aberrant examples in the law, but we should not craft rules for the needle rather than the haystack in an area like this.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that the accrual date of a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim is not postponed by the presence of a possible bar to suit under <i>Heck v. Humphrey,</i> 512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). I also agree with the rest of the Court and with Justice STEVENS that had petitioner timely filed his \u00a7 1983 case, the Federal District Court might have found it appropriate to stay the trial of his claims until the completion of state proceedings. <i>E.g., </i><i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 517 U.S. 706, 731, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996). In the absence of a stay, a litigant like petitioner would have had to divide his attention between criminal and civil cases with attendant risks of loss of time and energy as well as of inconsistent findings.</p>\n<p>The Court's holding, however, simply leads to the question of what is to happen when, for example, the possibility of a <i>Heck</i> problem prevents the court from considering the merits of a \u00a7 1983 claim. And I disagree with the Court's insistence upon a rule of law that would require immediate filing, followed by an uncertain system of stays, dismissals, and possible refiling. <i>Ante,</i> at 1099, n. 4 (majority opinion); <i>ante,</i> at 1101-1102 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). I disagree because there is a well-established legal tool better able to deal with the problems presented by this type of suit.</p>\n<p>Where a \"plaintiff because of disability, irremediable lack of information, or other circumstances beyond his control just cannot reasonably be expected to sue in time,\" courts have applied a doctrine of \"equitable tolling.\" <i>Miller v. Runyon,</i> 77 F.3d 189, 191 (C.A.7 1996) (Posner, C.J.). The doctrine tolls the running of the limitations period until the disabling circumstance can be overcome. (This is why the limitations period does not run against a falsely arrested person until his false imprisonment ends. His action has certainly accrued because, as the majority recognizes, he can file his claim immediately if he is able to do so. <i>Ante,</i> at 1095-1096, n. 3.) 77 F.3d, at 191; see also <i>Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.,</i> 920 F.2d 446, 450-453 (C.A.7 1990).</p>\n<p>In particular, equitable tolling could apply where a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff reasonably claims that the unlawful behavior of which he complains was, or will be, necessary to a criminal conviction. It could toll the running of the limitations period: (1) from the time charges are brought until the time they are dismissed or the defendant is acquitted or convicted, and (2) thereafter during any period in which the criminal defendant challenges a conviction (on direct appeal, on state collateral challenge, or on federal habeas) and reasonably asserts the behavior underlying the \u00a7 1983 action as a ground for overturning the conviction.</p>\n<p>I find it difficult to understand why the Court rejects the use of \"equitable tolling\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1103</span> in regard to typical \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs. <i>Ante,</i> at 1098-1099. The Court's alternative\u0097file all \u00a7 1983 claims (including potentially <i>Heck</i>-barred claims) at once and then seek stays or be subject to dismissal and refiling\u0097suffers serious practical disadvantages. For one thing, that approach would force all potential criminal defendants to file all potential \u00a7 1983 actions soon lest they lose those claims due to protracted criminal proceedings. For another, it would often require a federal court, seeking to determine whether to dismiss an action as <i>Heck</i> barred or to grant a stay, to consider issues likely being litigated in the criminal proceeding (Was the Constitution violated? Was the violation-related evidence necessary for conviction?). The federal court's decision as to whether a claim was <i>Heck</i> barred (say, whether the alleged constitutional violation was central to the state criminal conviction) might later bind a state court on conviction review. Because of this, even a claim without a likely <i>Heck</i> bar might linger on a federal docket because the federal court (or the plaintiff who has been forced to early file) wishes to avoid interfering with any state proceedings and therefore must postpone reaching, not only the merits of the \u00a7 1983 claim, but the threshold <i>Heck</i> inquiry as well.</p>\n<p>Principles of equitable tolling avoid these difficulties. Since equitable tolling obviates the need for immediate filing, it permits the criminal proceedings to winnow the constitutional wheat from chaff, and thereby increase the likelihood that the constitutionally meritless claims will never (in a \u00a7 1983 action) see the light of day. See <i>Allen v. McCurry,</i> 449 U.S. 90, 95-96, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980) (federal court gives preclusive effect to constitutional determinations as to issues already litigated in state court). Moreover, an appropriate equitable tolling principle would apply not only to state criminal proceedings as here, but also to state appellate proceedings, state collateral attacks, and federal <i>habeas</i> proceedings.</p>\n<p>Of course, \u00a7 1983 ordinarily borrows its limitations principles from state law. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(a). And I do not know whether or which States have comparable equitable tolling principles in place. If a given state court lacks the necessary tolling provision, however, \u00a7 1983, in my view, permits the federal courts to devise and impose such principles. See <i>Hardin v. Straub,</i> 490 U.S. 536, 538-540, 109 S.Ct. 1998, 104 L.Ed.2d 582 (1989) (\"[G]aps in federal civil rights acts should be filled by state law, as long as that law is not inconsistent with federal law\" and its \"chief goals of compensation and deterrence or its subsidiary goals of uniformity and federalism\" (footnote omitted)); <i>Heck v. Humphrey,</i> 997 F.2d 355, 358 (C.A.7 1993) (Posner, J.) (articulating why federal tolling regime may apply to \u00a7 1983 claims), aff'd on other grounds, 512 U.S., at 489, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Cf. <i>Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N.Y. v. Tomanio,</i> 446 U.S. 478, 490, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980).</p>\n<p>The use of equitable tolling in cases of potential temporal conflict between civil \u00a7 1983 and related criminal proceedings is consistent with, indeed, it would further, \u00a7 1983's basic purposes. It would provide for orderly adjudication, minimize the risk of inconsistent legal determinations, avoid clogging the courts with potentially unnecessary \"protective\" filings, and, above all, assure a plaintiff who possesses a meritorious \u00a7 1983 claim that his pursuit of criminal remedies designed to free him from unlawful confinement will not compromise his later ability to obtain civil \u00a7 1983 redress as well.</p>\n<p>The Court is wrong in concluding that the principle I have described would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1104</span> \"place\" the tolling \"question\" in \"jurisprudential limbo.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1099. Under the approach I propose, <i>supra,</i> at 1102-1103, a potential \u00a7 1983 plaintiff knows his claim is being tolled so long as the issues that claim would raise are being pursued in state court. Such a rule is prophylactic (it will sometimes toll claims that would not be barred by <i>Heck</i>), but under such an approach neither the plaintiff, nor the defendant, nor the federal court need speculate as to whether the claims are in any way barred until the state court has had the opportunity to consider the claims in the criminal context.</p>\n<p>A tolling principle certainly seems to me to create greater order than the rule the majority sets out, whereby all criminal defendants must file their \u00a7 1983 suits immediately, some will be stayed, some dismissed, and then some may be refiled and entitled to tolling, <i>ante,</i> at 1099, n. 4. The majority acknowledges that tolling may be necessary to protect the plaintiff who previously filed and was dismissed. <i>Ibid.</i> Why not simply apply that tolling principle across the board?</p>\n<p>The majority is also wrong when it suggests that the proposed equitable tolling rule would create a significant problem of lack of notice. <i>Ante,</i> at 1100. Because the rule would toll only while the potential \u00a7 1983 plaintiff is challenging the alleged misconduct in a state court, the State itself would have notice of the plaintiff's claims. For similar reasons, the potential individual \u00a7 1983 defendants, the state officers, would also likely have notice of the charge. But even if they do not, I believe that many would prefer to forgo immediate notice, for it comes with a pricetag attached\u0097the price consists of being immediately sued by the filing of a \u00a7 1983 lawsuit, rife with stays and delays, which otherwise, in the course of time (as claims are winnowed in state court) might never have been filed.</p>\n<p>The Court's suggested limitations system, like an equitable tolling rule, will produce some instances in which a plaintiff will file a \u00a7 1983 lawsuit at an initially uncertain future date. <i>Ante,</i> at 1099, n. 4. And, under both approaches, in the many \u00a7 1983 suits that do not involve any <i>Heck</i> bar, a defendant can and will file immediately and his suit would proceed (for there is no tolling unless the potential \u00a7 1983 plaintiff is asserting in a conviction challenge that a constitutional violation did impugn his conviction). My problem with the Court's approach lies in its insistence that all potential plaintiffs (including those whose suits may be <i>Heck</i> barred) file immediately\u0097even though their suits cannot then proceed. With tolling, only rarely would a plaintiff choose to file a potentially <i>Heck</i>-barred \u00a7 1983 suit while his criminal case is pending; and in those cases the district court could, if it wished, stay the action, or simply dismiss the suit without prejudice, secure in the knowledge that the suit could be timely filed at a later date.</p>\n<p>The Court's refusal to admit the equitable tolling possibility means that large numbers of defendants will be sued immediately by all potential \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs with arguable <i>Heck</i> issues, no matter how meritless the claims; these suits may be endlessly stayed or dismissed and then, at some point in the future, some defendants will also be sued again. With equitable tolling, however, defendants will be sued once, in suits with constitutional claims that a state court has not already found meritless, at a time when the suit can be promptly litigated. Given the practical difficulties of the Court's approach, I would not rule out now, in advance, the use of an equitable tolling rule along the lines I have described.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1105</span> Because this matter has not been fully argued, I would vacate the Seventh Circuit's determination and remand for consideration of the issues I here raise. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  All of petitioner's other state and federal claims were resolved adversely to him and are not before us. We expressly limited our grant of certiorari to the Fourth Amendment false-arrest claim. See 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2891 (2006). The city of Chicago is no longer a party to this suit.</p>\n<p>[2]  We have never explored the contours of a Fourth Amendment malicious-prosecution suit under \u00a7 1983, see <i>Albright v. Oliver,</i> 510 U.S. 266, 270-271, 275, 114 S.Ct. 807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994) (plurality opinion), and we do not do so here. See generally 1 M. Schwartz, Section 1983 Litigation \u00a7 3.18[C], pp. 3-605 to 3-629 (4th ed.2004) (noting a range of approaches in the lower courts). Assuming without deciding that such a claim is cognizable under \u00a7 1983, petitioner has not made one. Petitioner did not include such a claim in his complaint. He in fact abandoned a state-law malicious-prosecution claim in the District Court, and stated, in his opposition to respondents' first motion for summary judgment, that \"Plaintiff does not seek to raise . . . a malicious prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983,\" Record, Doc. 17, p. 3, n. 5. In this Court, he has told us that respondents are \"mistaken in characterizing petitioner's cause of action as involving `unwarranted prosecution.'\" Reply Brief 12.</p>\n<p>[3]  This is not to say, of course, that petitioner could not have filed suit immediately upon his false arrest. While the statute of limitations did not begin to run until petitioner became detained pursuant to legal process, he was injured and suffered damages at the moment of his arrest, and was entitled to bring suit at that time. See <i>Adler v. Beverly Hills Hospital,</i> 594 S.W.2d 153, 156 (Tex.Civ.App.1980) (\"We may concede that a person falsely imprisoned has the right to sue on the first day for his detention\").</p>\n<p>[4]  Had petitioner filed suit upon his arrest and had his suit then been dismissed under <i>Heck,</i> the statute of limitations, absent tolling, would have run by the time he obtained reversal of his conviction. If under those circumstances he were not allowed to refile his suit, <i>Heck</i> would produce immunity from \u00a7 1983 liability, a result surely not intended. Because in the present case petitioner did not file his suit within the limitations period, we need not decide, had he done so, how much time he would have had to refile the suit once the <i>Heck</i> bar was removed.</p>\n<p>[5]  Justice STEVENS reaches the same result by arguing that, under <i>Stone v. Powell,</i> 428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), the <i>Heck</i> bar can never come into play in a \u00a7 1983 suit seeking damages for a Fourth Amendment violation, so that \"a habeas remedy was never available to [petitioner] in the first place.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1101 (opinion concurring in judgment). This reads <i>Stone</i> to say more than it does. Under <i>Stone,</i> Fourth Amendment violations are <i>generally</i> not cognizable on federal habeas, but they <i>are</i> cognizable when the State has failed to provide the habeas petitioner \"an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim.\" 428 U.S., at 482, 96 S.Ct. 3037. Federal habeas petitioners have sometimes succeeded in arguing that <i>Stone's</i> general prohibition does not apply. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Herrera v. Lemaster,</i> 225 F.3d 1176, 1178 (2000), aff'd on this point, 301 F.3d 1192, 1195, n. 4 (C.A.10 2002) (en banc); <i>United States ex rel. Bostick v. Peters,</i> 3 F.3d 1023, 1029 (C.A.7 1993); <i>Agee v. White,</i> 809 F.2d 1487, 1490 (C.A.11 1987); <i>Doescher v. Estelle,</i> 666 F.2d 285, 287 (C.A.5 1982); <i>Boyd v. Mintz,</i> 631 F.2d 247, 250-251 (C.A.3 1980); see also 2 R. Hertz &amp; J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 27.1-27.3, pp. 1373-1389 (5th ed.2005). At the time of a Fourth Amendment wrong, and at the time of conviction, it cannot be known whether a prospective \u00a7 1983 plaintiff will receive a full and fair opportunity to litigate his Fourth Amendment claim. It thus remains the case that a conflict with the federal habeas statute is possible, that a Fourth Amendment claim can necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction, and that if it does it must, under <i>Heck,</i> be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p>Insofar as Justice STEVENS simply suggests that <i>Heck</i> has no bearing here because <i>petitioner</i> received a full and fair opportunity to litigate his Fourth Amendment claim in state court, the argument is equally untenable. At the time that petitioner became detained pursuant to legal process, it was impossible to predict whether this would be true. And even at the point when his limitations period ended, state proceedings on his conviction were ongoing; full and fair opportunity up to that point was not enough. <i>Stone</i> requires full and fair opportunity to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim \"at trial <i>and on direct review.</i>\" 428 U.S., at 494-495, n. 37, 96 S.Ct. 3037 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[1]  See <i>Heck,</i> 512 U.S., at 492, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment) (\"Common-law tort rules can provide a `starting point for the inquiry under \u00a7 1983,' <i>Carey v.

Argued November 6, 2006\u2014Decided February 21, 2007\n\n\nIn January 1994, Chicago police arrested petitioner, a minor, for mur\n  der. He was tried and convicted, but the charges were ultimately\n  dropped in April 2002. In April 2003, he filed this suit under 42\n  U. S. C. \u00a71983 against the city and several of its officers, seeking\n  damages for, inter alia, his unlawful arrest in violation of the Fourth\n  Amendment. The District Court granted respondents summary\n  judgment, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed, ruling that the \u00a71983\n  suit was time barred because petitioner\u2019s cause of action accrued at\n  the time of his arrest, not when his conviction was later set aside.\nHeld: The statute of limitations upon a \u00a71983 claim seeking damages\n for a false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, where the\n arrest is followed by criminal proceedings, begins to run at the time\n the claimant becomes detained pursuant to legal process. Pp. 2\u201312.\n    (a) The statute of limitations in a \u00a71983 suit is that provided by the\n State for personal-injury torts, e.g., Owens v. Okure, 488 U. S. 235,\n 249\u2013250; here, two years under Illinois law. For false imprisonment\n and its subspecies false arrest, \u201c[t]he . . . cause[s] of action provid[ing]\n the closest analogy to claims of the type considered here,\u201d Heck v.\n Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 484, the statute of limitations begins to\n run when the alleged false imprisonment ends, see, e.g., 4 Restate\n ment (Second) of Torts \u00a7899, Comment c, that is, in the present con\n text, when the victim becomes held pursuant to legal process, see,\n e.g., Heck, supra, at 484. Thus, petitioner\u2019s false imprisonment did\n not end, as he contends, when he was released from custody after the\n State dropped the charges against him, but rather when he appeared\n before the examining magistrate and was bound over for trial. Since\n2                           WALLACE v. KATO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    more than two years elapsed between that date and the filing of this\n    suit\u2014even leaving out of the count the period before he reached his\n    majority\u2014the action was time barred. Pp. 2\u20137.\n       (b) Petitioner\u2019s contention that Heck compels the conclusion that\n    his suit could not accrue until the State dropped its charges against\n    him is rejected. The Heck Court held that \u201cin order to recover dam\n    ages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for\n    other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a\n    conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a71983 plaintiff must prove that the\n    conviction or sentence has been [set aside]. A claim for damages\n    bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has not\n    been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a71983.\u201d 512 U. S., at\n    486\u2013487. Even assuming that the Heck deferred-accrual rule would\n    be applied to the date petitioner was first held pursuant to legal\n    process, there was in existence at that time no criminal conviction\n    that the cause of action would impugn. What petitioner seeks is the\n    adoption of a principle going well beyond Heck: that an action which\n    would impugn an anticipated future conviction cannot be brought un\n    til that conviction occurs and is set aside. The impracticality of such\n    a speculative rule is obvious.\n       The fact that \u00a71983 actions sometimes accrue before the setting\n    aside of\u2014indeed, even before the existence of\u2014the related criminal\n    conviction raises the question whether, assuming the Heck bar takes\n    effect when the later conviction is obtained, the statute of limitations\n    on the once valid cause of action is tolled as long as the Heck bar sub\n    sists. However, this Court generally refers to state-law tolling rules,\n    e.g., Hardin v. Straub, 490 U. S. 536, 538\u2013539, and is unaware of Il\n    linois cases providing tolling in even remotely comparable circum\n    stances. Moreover, a federal tolling rule to this effect would create a\n    jurisprudential limbo in which it would not be known whether tolling\n    is appropriate by reason of the Heck bar until it is established that\n    the newly entered conviction would be impugned by the not-yet-filed,\n    and thus utterly indeterminate, \u00a71983 claim.

Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71983, seeking damages for an arrest that violated the\nFourth Amendment. We decide whether his suit is timely.\n                               I\n   On January 17, 1994, John Handy was shot to death in\nthe city of Chicago. Sometime around 8 p.m. two days\nlater, Chicago police officers located petitioner, then 15\nyears of age, and transported him to a police station for\nquestioning. After interrogations that lasted into the\nearly morning hours the next day, petitioner agreed to\nconfess to Handy\u2019s murder. An assistant state\u2019s attorney\nprepared a statement to this effect, and petitioner signed\nit, at the same time waiving his Miranda rights.\n   Prior to trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County, peti\ntioner unsuccessfully attempted to suppress his station\nhouse statements as the product of an unlawful arrest. He\nwas convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 26\nyears in prison. On direct appeal, the Appellate Court of\nIllinois held that officers had arrested petitioner without\nprobable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n2                        WALLACE v. KATO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nPeople v. Wallace, 299 Ill. App. 3d 9, 17\u201318, 701 N. E. 2d\n87, 94 (1998). According to that court (whose determina\ntion we are not reviewing here), even assuming petitioner\nwillingly accompanied police to the station, his presence\nthere \u201cescalated to an involuntary seizure prior to his\nformal arrest.\u201d Id., at 18, 701 N. E. 2d, at 94. After an\nother round of appeals, the Appellate Court concluded on\nAugust 31, 2001, that the effect of petitioner\u2019s illegal\narrest had not been sufficiently attenuated to render his\nstatements admissible, see Brown v. Illinois, 422 U. S. 590\n(1975), and remanded for a new trial. Judgt. order re\nported sub nom. People v. Wallace, 324 Ill. App. 3d 1139,\n805 N. E. 2d 756 (2001). On April 10, 2002, prosecutors\ndropped the charges against petitioner.\n   On April 2, 2003, petitioner filed this \u00a71983 suit against\nthe city of Chicago and several Chicago police officers,\nseeking damages arising from, inter alia, his unlawful\narrest.1 The District Court granted summary judgment to\nrespondents and the Court of Appeals affirmed. According\nto the Seventh Circuit, petitioner\u2019s \u00a71983 suit was time\nbarred because his cause of action accrued at the time of\nhis arrest, and not when his conviction was later set aside.\nWallace v. Chicago, 440 F. 3d 421, 427 (2006). We granted\ncertiorari, 547 U. S. ___ (2006).\n                              II\n  Section 1983 provides a federal cause of action, but in\nseveral respects relevant here federal law looks to the law\nof the State in which the cause of action arose. This is so\nfor the length of the statute of limitations: It is that which\nthe State provides for personal-injury torts. Owens v.\nOkure, 488 U. S. 235, 249\u2013250 (1989); Wilson v. Garcia,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 All\n       of petitioner\u2019s other state and federal claims were resolved ad\nversely to him and are not before us. We expressly limited our grant of\ncertiorari to the Fourth Amendment false-arrest claim. See 547 U. S.\n___ (2006). The city of Chicago is no longer a party to this suit.\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n471 U. S. 261, 279\u2013280 (1985). The parties agree that\nunder Illinois law, this period is two years. Ill. Comp.\nStat., ch. 735, \u00a75/13\u2013202 (West 2003). Thus, if the statute\non petitioner\u2019s cause of action began to run at the time of\nhis unlawful arrest, or even at the time he was ordered\nheld by a magistrate, his \u00a71983 suit was plainly dilatory,\neven according him tolling for the two-plus years of his\nminority, see \u00a75/13\u2013211. But if, as the dissenting judge\nargued below, the commencement date for running of the\nstatute is governed by this Court\u2019s decision in Heck v.\nHumphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), that date may be the\ndate on which petitioner\u2019s conviction was vacated, in\nwhich case the \u00a71983 suit would have been timely filed.\n   While we have never stated so expressly, the accrual\ndate of a \u00a71983 cause of action is a question of federal law\nthat is not resolved by reference to state law. The parties\nagree, the Seventh Circuit in this case so held, see 440\nF. 3d, at 424, and we are aware of no federal court of\nappeals holding to the contrary. Aspects of \u00a71983 which\nare not governed by reference to state law are governed by\nfederal rules conforming in general to common-law tort\nprinciples. See Heck, supra, at 483; Carey v. Piphus, 435\nU. S. 247, 257\u2013258 (1978). Under those principles, it is\n\u201cthe standard rule that [accrual occurs] when the plaintiff\nhas \u2018a complete and present cause of action.\u2019 \u201d Bay Area\nLaundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar\nCorp. of Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997) (quoting Rawlings\nv. Ray, 312 U. S. 96, 98 (1941)), that is, when \u201cthe plaintiff\ncan file suit and obtain relief,\u201d Bay Area Laundry, supra,\nat 201. There can be no dispute that petitioner could have\nfiled suit as soon as the allegedly wrongful arrest oc\ncurred, subjecting him to the harm of involuntary deten\ntion, so the statute of limitations would normally com\nmence to run from that date.\n   There is, however, a refinement to be considered, arising\nfrom the common law\u2019s distinctive treatment of the torts of\n4                    WALLACE v. KATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfalse arrest and false imprisonment, \u201c[t]he . . . cause[s] of\naction [that] provid[e] the closest analogy to claims of the\ntype considered here,\u201d Heck, supra, at 484. See 1 D.\nDobbs, Law of Torts \u00a747, p. 88 (2001). False arrest and\nfalse imprisonment overlap; the former is a species of the\nlatter. \u201cEvery confinement of the person is an imprison\nment, whether it be in a common prison or in a private\nhouse, or in the stocks, or even by forcibly detaining one in\nthe public streets; and when a man is lawfully in a house,\nit is imprisonment to prevent him from leaving the room\nin which he is.\u201d M. Newell, Law of Malicious Prosecution,\nFalse Imprisonment, and Abuse of Legal Process \u00a72, p. 57\n(1892) (footnotes omitted). See also 7 S. Speiser, C.\nKrause, & A. Gans, American Law of Torts \u00a727:2, pp. 940\u2013\n942 (1990). We shall thus refer to the two torts together\nas false imprisonment. That tort provides the proper\nanalogy to the cause of action asserted against the present\nrespondents for the following reason: The sort of unlawful\ndetention remediable by the tort of false imprisonment is\ndetention without legal process, see, e.g., W. Keeton, D.\nDobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law\nof Torts \u00a711, p. 54, \u00a7119, pp. 885\u2013886 (5th ed. 1984); 7\nSpeiser, supra, \u00a727:2, at 943\u2013944, and the allegations\nbefore us arise from respondents\u2019 detention of petitioner\nwithout legal process in January 1994. They did not have\na warrant for his arrest.\n   The running of the statute of limitations on false im\nprisonment is subject to a distinctive rule\u2014dictated, per\nhaps, by the reality that the victim may not be able to sue\nwhile he is still imprisoned: \u201cLimitations begin to run\nagainst an action for false imprisonment when the alleged\nfalse imprisonment ends.\u201d 2 H. Wood, Limitation of Ac\ntions \u00a7187d(4), p. 878 (4th rev. ed. 1916); see also 4 Re\nstatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7899, Comment c (1977); A.\nUnderhill, Principles of Law of Torts 202 (1881). Thus, to\ndetermine the beginning of the limitations period in this\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncase, we must determine when petitioner\u2019s false impris\nonment came to an end.\n  Reflective of the fact that false imprisonment consists of\ndetention without legal process, a false imprisonment ends\nonce the victim becomes held pursuant to such process\u2014\nwhen, for example, he is bound over by a magistrate or\narraigned on charges. Dobbs, supra, \u00a739, at 74, n. 2;\nKeeton, supra, \u00a7119, at 888; H. Stephen, Actions for Mali\ncious Prosecution 120\u2013123 (1888). Thereafter, unlawful\ndetention forms part of the damages for the \u201centirely\ndistinct\u201d tort of malicious prosecution, which remedies\ndetention accompanied, not by absence of legal process,\nbut by wrongful institution of legal process.2 Keeton,\nsupra, \u00a7119, at 885\u2013886; see 1 F. Harper, F. James, & O.\nGray, Law of Torts \u00a73.9, p. 3:36 (3d ed. 1996); 7 Speiser,\nsupra, \u00a727:2, at 943\u2013945. \u201cIf there is a false arrest claim,\ndamages for that claim cover the time of detention up\nuntil issuance of process or arraignment, but not more.\nFrom that point on, any damages recoverable must be\nbased on a malicious prosecution claim and on the wrong\nful use of judicial process rather than detention itself.\u201d\nKeeton, supra, \u00a7119, at 888; see also Heck, supra, at 484; 8\nSpeiser, supra, \u00a728:15, at 80. Thus, petitioner\u2019s contention\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 We  have never explored the contours of a Fourth Amendment mali\ncious-prosecution suit under \u00a71983, see Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S.\n266, 270\u2013271, 275 (1994) (plurality opinion), and we do not do so here.\nSee generally 1 M. Schwartz, Section 1983 Litigation \u00a73.18[C], pp. 3\u2013\n605 to 3\u2013629 (4th ed. 2004) (noting a range of approaches in the lower\ncourts). Assuming without deciding that such a claim is cognizable\nunder \u00a71983, petitioner has not made one. Petitioner did not include\nsuch a claim in his complaint. He in fact abandoned a state-law mali\ncious-prosecution claim in the District Court, and stated, in his opposi\ntion to respondents\u2019 first motion for summary judgment, that \u201cPlaintiff\ndoes not seek to raise . . . a malicious prosecution claim under \u00a71983,\u201d\nRecord, Doc. 17, p. 3, n. 5. In this Court, he has told us that respon\ndents are \u201cmistaken in characterizing petitioner\u2019s cause of action as\ninvolving \u2018unwarranted prosecution.\u2019 \u201d Reply Brief 12.\n6                          WALLACE v. KATO\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthat his false imprisonment ended upon his release from\ncustody, after the State dropped the charges against him,\nmust be rejected. It ended much earlier, when legal proc\ness was initiated against him, and the statute would have\nbegun to run from that date, but for its tolling by reason of\npetitioner\u2019s minority.3\n   Petitioner asserts that the date of his release from\ncustody must be the relevant date in the circumstances of\nthe present suit, since he is seeking damages up to that\ntime. The theory of his complaint is that the initial\nFourth Amendment violation set the wheels in motion for\nhis subsequent conviction and detention: The unlawful\narrest led to the coerced confession, which was introduced\nat his trial, producing his conviction and incarceration. As\nwe have just explained, at common law damages for de\ntention after issuance of process or arraignment would be\nattributable to a tort other than the unlawful arrest al\nleged in petitioner\u2019s complaint\u2014and probably a tort\nchargeable to defendants other than the respondents here.\nEven assuming, however, that all damages for detention\npursuant to legal process could be regarded as consequen\ntial damages attributable to the unlawful arrest, that\nwould not alter the commencement date for the statute of\nlimitations. \u201cUnder the traditional rule of accrual . . . the\ntort cause of action accrues, and the statute of limitations\ncommences to run, when the wrongful act or omission\nresults in damages. The cause of action accrues even\nthough the full extent of the injury is not then known or\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 This\n         is not to say, of course, that petitioner could not have filed suit\nimmediately upon his false arrest. While the statute of limitations did\nnot begin to run until petitioner became detained pursuant to legal\nprocess, he was injured and suffered damages at the moment of his\narrest, and was entitled to bring suit at that time. See Adler v. Beverly\nHills Hospital, 594 S. W. 2d 153, 156 (Tex. Civ. App. 1980) (\u201cWe may\nconcede that a person falsely imprisoned has the right to sue on the\nfirst day for his detention\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npredictable.\u201d 1 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions \u00a77.4.1,\npp. 526\u2013527 (1991) (footnotes omitted); see also 54 C. J. S.,\nLimitations of Actions \u00a7112, p. 150 (2005). Were it other\nwise, the statute would begin to run only after a plaintiff\nbecame satisfied that he had been harmed enough, placing\nthe supposed statute of repose in the sole hands of the\nparty seeking relief.\n   We conclude that the statute of limitations on peti\ntioner\u2019s \u00a71983 claim commenced to run when he appeared\nbefore the examining magistrate and was bound over for\ntrial. Since more than two years elapsed between that\ndate and the filing of this suit\u2014even leaving out of the\ncount the period before he reached his majority\u2014the\naction was time barred.\n                             III\n   This would end the matter, were it not for petitioner\u2019s\ncontention that Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S., at 477,\ncompels the conclusion that his suit could not accrue until\nthe State dropped its charges against him. In Heck, a\nstate prisoner filed suit under \u00a71983 raising claims which,\nif true, would have established the invalidity of his out\nstanding conviction. We analogized his suit to one for\nmalicious prosecution, an element of which is the favor\nable termination of criminal proceedings. Id., at 484. We\nsaid:\n    \u201c[I]n order to recover damages for allegedly unconsti\n    tutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm\n    caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a\n    conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a71983 plaintiff must\n    prove that the conviction or sentence has been re\n    versed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order,\n    declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to\n    make such determination, or called into question by a\n    federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a72254. A claim for damages bearing that re\n8                     WALLACE v. KATO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    lationship to a conviction or sentence that has not\n    been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a71983.\u201d\n    Id., at 486\u2013487 (footnote omitted).\nWe rested this conclusion upon \u201cthe hoary principle that\ncivil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challeng\ning the validity of outstanding criminal judgments.\u201d Id.,\nat 486. \u201c \u2018Congress,\u2019 \u201d we said, \u201c \u2018has determined that ha\nbeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for state prisoners\nattacking the validity of the fact or length of their con\nfinement, and that specific determination must override\nthe general terms of \u00a71983.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 482 (quoting Preiser\nv. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 490 (1973)).\n   As the above excerpts show, the Heck rule for deferred\naccrual is called into play only when there exists \u201ca convic\ntion or sentence that has not been . . . invalidated,\u201d that is\nto say, an \u201coutstanding criminal judgment.\u201d It delays\nwhat would otherwise be the accrual date of a tort action\nuntil the setting aside of an extant conviction which suc\ncess in that tort action would impugn. We assume that,\nfor purposes of the present tort action, the Heck principle\nwould be applied not to the date of accrual but to the date\non which the statute of limitations began to run, that is,\nthe date petitioner became held pursuant to legal process.\nSee supra, at 4\u20135. Even at that later time, there was in\nexistence no criminal conviction that the cause of action\nwould impugn; indeed, there may not even have been an\nindictment.\n   What petitioner seeks, in other words, is the adoption of\na principle that goes well beyond Heck: that an action\nwhich would impugn an anticipated future conviction\ncannot be brought until that conviction occurs and is set\naside. The impracticality of such a rule should be obvious.\nIn an action for false arrest it would require the plaintiff\n(and if he brings suit promptly, the court) to speculate\nabout whether a prosecution will be brought, whether it\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwill result in conviction, and whether the pending civil\naction will impugn that verdict, see Heck, 512 U. S., at\n487, n. 7\u2014all this at a time when it can hardly be known\nwhat evidence the prosecution has in its possession. And\nwhat if the plaintiff (or the court) guesses wrong, and the\nanticipated future conviction never occurs, because of\nacquittal or dismissal? Does that event (instead of the\nHeck-required setting aside of the extant conviction) trig\nger accrual of the cause of action? Or what if prosecution\nnever occurs\u2014what will the trigger be then?\n   We are not disposed to embrace this bizarre extension of\nHeck. If a plaintiff files a false arrest claim before he has\nbeen convicted (or files any other claim related to rulings\nthat will likely be made in a pending or anticipated crimi\nnal trial), it is within the power of the district court, and\nin accord with common practice, to stay the civil action\nuntil the criminal case or the likelihood of a criminal case\nis ended. See id., at 487\u2013488, n. 8 (noting that \u201cabstention\nmay be an appropriate response to the parallel state-court\nproceedings\u201d); Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S.\n706, 730 (1996). If the plaintiff is ultimately convicted,\nand if the stayed civil suit would impugn that conviction,\nHeck will require dismissal; otherwise, the civil action will\nproceed, absent some other bar to suit. Edwards v. Bali\nsok, 520 U. S. 641, 649 (1997); Heck, 512 U. S., at 487.\n   There is, however, one complication that we must ad\ndress here. It arises from the fact that \u00a71983 actions,\nunlike the tort of malicious prosecution which Heck took\nas its model, see id., at 484, sometimes accrue before the\nsetting aside of\u2014indeed, even before the existence of\u2014the\nrelated criminal conviction. That of course is the case\nhere, and it raises the question whether, assuming that\nthe Heck bar takes effect when the later conviction is\nobtained, the statute of limitations on the once valid cause\nof action is tolled as long as the Heck bar subsists. In the\ncontext of the present case: If petitioner\u2019s conviction on\n10                       WALLACE v. KATO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nApril 19, 1996, caused the statute of limitations on his\n(possibly) impugning but yet-to-be-filed cause of action to\nbe tolled until that conviction was set aside, his filing here\nwould have been timely.\n   We have generally referred to state law for tolling rules,\njust as we have for the length of statutes of limitation.\nHardin v. Straub, 490 U. S. 536, 538\u2013539 (1989); Board of\nRegents of Univ. of State of N. Y. v. Tomanio, 446 U. S.\n478, 484\u2013486 (1980). Petitioner has not brought to our\nattention, nor are we aware of, Illinois cases providing\ntolling in even remotely comparable circumstances. (In\ndeed, petitioner did not even argue for such tolling below,\nthough he supported its suggestion at oral argument.)\nNor would we be inclined to adopt a federal tolling rule to\nthis effect. Under such a regime, it would not be known\nwhether tolling is appropriate by reason of the Heck bar\nuntil it is established that the newly entered conviction\nwould be impugned by the not-yet-filed, and thus utterly\nindeterminate, \u00a71983 claim.4 It would hardly be desirable\nto place the question of tolling vel non in this jurispruden\ntial limbo, leaving it to be determined by those later\nevents, and then pronouncing it retroactively. Defendants\nneed to be on notice to preserve beyond the normal limita\ntions period evidence that will be needed for their defense;\nand a statute that becomes retroactively extended, by the\naction of the plaintiff in crafting a conviction-impugning\ncause of action, is hardly a statute of repose.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Had petitioner filed suit upon his arrest and had his suit then been\n\ndismissed under Heck, the statute of limitations, absent tolling, would\nhave run by the time he obtained reversal of his conviction. If under\nthose circumstances he were not allowed to refile his suit, Heck would\nproduce immunity from \u00a71983 liability, a result surely not intended.\nBecause in the present case petitioner did not file his suit within the\nlimitations period, we need not decide, had he done so, how much time\nhe would have had to refile the suit once the Heck bar was removed.\n  5 JUSTICE STEVENS reaches the same result by arguing that, under\n\nStone v.

As\nbest we can tell, the only rationale for such a rule is the\nconcern that \u201cpetitioner would have had to divide his\nattention between criminal and civil cases.\u201d Post, at 1.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nplay in a \u00a71983 suit seeking damages for a Fourth Amendment viola\ntion, so that \u201ca habeas remedy was never available to [petitioner] in the\nfirst place.\u201d Post, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment). This reads\nStone to say more than it does. Under Stone, Fourth Amendment\nviolations are generally not cognizable on federal habeas, but they are\ncognizable when the State has failed to provide the habeas petitioner\n\u201can opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment\nclaim.\u201d 428 U. S., at 482. Federal habeas petitioners have sometimes\nsucceeded in arguing that Stone\u2019s general prohibition does not apply.\nSee, e.g., Herrera v. LeMaster, 225 F. 3d 1176, 1178 (2000), aff\u2019d on this\npoint, 301 F. 3d 1192, 1195, n. 4 (CA10 2002) (en banc); United States\nex rel. Bostick v. Peters, 3 F. 3d 1023, 1029 (CA7 1993); Agee v.

At the time of a\nFourth Amendment wrong, and at the time of conviction, it cannot be\nknown whether a prospective \u00a71983 plaintiff will receive a full and fair\nopportunity to litigate his Fourth Amendment claim. It thus remains\nthe case that a conflict with the federal habeas statute is possible, that\na Fourth Amendment claim can necessarily imply the invalidity of a\nconviction, and that if it does it must, under Heck, be dismissed.\n   Insofar as JUSTICE STEVENS simply suggests that Heck has no bearing\nhere because petitioner received a full and fair opportunity to litigate\nhis Fourth Amendment claim in state court, the argument is equally\nuntenable. At the time that petitioner became detained pursuant to\nlegal process, it was impossible to predict whether this would be true.\nAnd even at the point when his limitations period ended, state proceed\nings on his conviction were ongoing; full and fair opportunity up to that\npoint was not enough. Stone requires full and fair opportunity to\nlitigate a Fourth Amendment claim \u201cat trial and on direct review.\u201d 428\nU.

If a defendant has a breach-of-contract claim against\nthe prime contractor for his new home, is he entitled to\ntolling for that as well while his criminal case is pending?\nEquitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual\ncircumstances, not a cure-all for an entirely common state\nof affairs. Besides its never-heard-of-before quality, the\ndissent\u2019s proposal suffers from a more ironic flaw. Al\nthough the dissent criticizes us for having to develop a\nsystem of stays and dismissals, it should be obvious that\nthe omnibus tolling solution will require the same. De\nspite the existence of the new tolling rule, some (if not\nmost) plaintiffs will nevertheless file suit before or during\nstate criminal proceedings. How does the dissent propose\nto handle such suits? Finally, the dissent\u2019s contention\nthat law enforcement officers would prefer the possibility\nof a later \u00a71983 suit to the more likely reality of an imme\ndiate filing, post at 5, is both implausible and contradicted\nby those who know best.

The alleged Fourth\nAmendment violation at issue in this case had two distinct\nconsequences for petitioner: First, it provided him with a\nfederal cause of action for damages under 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71983, and second, it provided him with an objection to the\nadmissibility of certain evidence in his state criminal trial.\nThe crux of petitioner\u2019s argument before this Court is that\nHeck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), provides the\nappropriate rule of accrual for his \u00a71983 claim. As both he\nand the majority note, Heck held that\n     \u201cin order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitu\n    tional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm\n    caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a\n    conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a71983 plaintiff must\n    prove that the conviction or sentence has been re\n    versed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order,\n    declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to\n    make such determination, or called into question by a\n    federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a72254. . . . Thus, when a state prisoner seeks\n    damages in a \u00a71983 suit, the district court must con\n    sider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff\n2                           WALLACE v. KATO\n\n                   STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n       would necessarily imply the invalidity of his convic\n       tion or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be\n       dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that\n       the conviction or sentence has already been invali\n       dated.\u201d Id., at 486\u2013487 (footnote omitted).\nRelying on this principle, petitioner contends that his\nfederal cause of action did not accrue until after the crimi\nnal charges against him were dropped.\n  Unlike the majority, my analysis would not depend on\nany common-law tort analogies.1 Instead, I would begin\nwhere all nine Justices began in Heck. That case, we\nunanimously agreed, required the Court to reconcile \u00a71983\nwith the federal habeas corpus statute.2 In concluding\nthat Heck\u2019s damages claim was not cognizable under\n\u00a71983, we found that the writ of habeas corpus, and not\n\u00a71983, affords the \u201c \u2018appropriate remedy for state prisoners\nattacking the validity of the fact or length of their con\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 SeeHeck, 512 U.

Given our holding in Stone v.\nPowell, 428 U. S. 465, 481\u2013482 (1976), however, that writ\ncannot provide a remedy for this petitioner.

S. C. \u00a71983 claim is not postponed by the presence of a\npossible bar to suit under Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S.\n477 (1994). I also agree with the rest of the Court and\nwith JUSTICE STEVENS that had petitioner timely filed his\n\u00a71983 case, the Federal District Court might have found it\nappropriate to stay the trial of his claims until the comple\ntion of state proceedings. E.g., Quackenbush v. Allstate\nIns. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 731 (1996). In the absence of a\nstay, a litigant like petitioner would have had to divide his\nattention between criminal and civil cases with attendant\nrisks of loss of time and energy as well as of inconsistent\nfindings.\n   The Court\u2019s holding, however, simply leads to the ques\ntion of what is to happen when, for example, the possibil\nity of a Heck problem prevents the court from considering\nthe merits of a \u00a71983 claim. And I disagree with the\nCourt\u2019s insistence upon a rule of law that would require\nimmediate filing, followed by an uncertain system of stays,\ndismissals, and possible refiling. Ante, at 9\u201310, n. 4 (ma\njority opinion); ante, at 3 (STEVENS, J., concurring in\njudgment).

Runyon, 77 F. 3d 189, 191 (CA7 1996) (Posner,\nC. J.). The doctrine tolls the running of the limitations\nperiod until the disabling circumstance can be overcome.\n(This is why the limitations period does not run against a\nfalsely arrested person until his false imprisonment ends.\nHis action has certainly accrued because, as the majority\nrecognizes, he can file his claim immediately if he is able\nto do so. Ante, at 4, 6, n. 3.) 77 F. 3d, at 191; see also\nCada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 920 F. 2d 446, 450\u2013453\n(CA7 1990).\n   In particular, equitable tolling could apply where a\n\u00a71983 plaintiff reasonably claims that the unlawful behav\nior of which he complains was, or will be, necessary to a\ncriminal conviction. It could toll the running of the limita\ntions period: (1) from the time charges are brought until\nthe time they are dismissed or the defendant is acquitted\nor convicted, and (2) thereafter during any period in which\nthe criminal defendant challenges a conviction (on direct\nappeal, on state collateral challenge, or on federal habeas)\nand reasonably asserts the behavior underlying the \u00a71983\naction as a ground for overturning the conviction.\n   I find it difficult to understand why the Court rejects the\nuse of \u201cequitable tolling\u201d in regard to typical \u00a71983 plain\ntiffs. Ante, at 10. The Court\u2019s alternative\u2014file all \u00a71983\nclaims (including potentially Heck-barred claims) at once\nand then seek stays or be subject to dismissal and refil\ning\u2014suffers serious practical disadvantages. For one\nthing, that approach would force all potential criminal\ndefendants to file all potential \u00a71983 actions soon lest they\nlose those claims due to protracted criminal proceedings.\nFor another, it would often require a federal court, seeking\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

The federal court\u2019s decision as to whether a claim\nwas Heck barred (say, whether the alleged constitutional\nviolation was central to the state criminal conviction)\nmight later bind a state court on conviction review. Be\ncause of this, even a claim without a likely Heck bar might\nlinger on a federal docket because the federal court (or the\nplaintiff who has been forced to early file) wishes to avoid\ninterfering with any state proceedings and therefore must\npostpone reaching, not only the merits of the \u00a71983 claim,\nbut the threshold Heck inquiry as well.\n   Principles of equitable tolling avoid these difficulties.\nSince equitable tolling obviates the need for immediate\nfiling, it permits the criminal proceedings to winnow the\nconstitutional wheat from chaff, and thereby increase the\nlikelihood that the constitutionally meritless claims will\nnever (in a \u00a71983 action) see the light of day. See Allen v.\nMcCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 95\u201396 (1980) (federal court gives\npreclusive effect to constitutional determinations as to\nissues already litigated in state court). Moreover, an\nappropriate equitable tolling principle would apply not\nonly to state criminal proceedings as here, but also to state\nappellate proceedings, state collateral attacks, and federal\nhabeas proceedings.\n   Of course, \u00a71983 ordinarily borrows its limitations\nprinciples from state law. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988(a). And I do\nnot know whether or which States have comparable equi\ntable tolling principles in place. If a given state court\nlacks the necessary tolling provision, however, \u00a71983, in\nmy view, permits the federal courts to devise and impose\nsuch principles. See Hardin v. Straub, 490 U. S. 536, 538\u2013\n540 (1989) (\u201c[G]aps in federal civil rights acts should be\nfilled by state law, as long as that law is not inconsistent\n4                    WALLACE v.

Board of Regents of Univ.\nof State of N. Y. v. Tomanio, 446 U. S. 478, 490 (1980).\n   The use of equitable tolling in cases of potential tempo\nral conflict between civil \u00a71983 and related criminal pro\nceedings is consistent with, indeed, it would further,\n\u00a71983\u2019s basic purposes. It would provide for orderly adju\ndication, minimize the risk of inconsistent legal determina\ntions, avoid clogging the courts with potentially unneces\nsary \u201cprotective\u201d filings, and, above all, assure a plaintiff\nwho possesses a meritorious \u00a71983 claim that his pursuit\nof criminal remedies designed to free him from unlawful\nconfinement will not compromise his later ability to obtain\ncivil \u00a71983 redress as well.\n   The Court is wrong in concluding that the principle I\nhave described would \u201cplace\u201d the tolling \u201cquestion\u201d in\n\u201cjurisprudential limbo.\u201d Ante, at 10. Under the approach\nI propose, supra, at 2, a potential \u00a71983 plaintiff knows his\nclaim is being tolled so long as the issues that claim would\nraise are being pursued in state court. Such a rule is\nprophylactic (it will sometimes toll claims that would not\nbe barred by Heck), but under such an approach neither\nthe plaintiff, nor the defendant, nor the federal court need\nspeculate as to whether the claims are in any way barred\nuntil the state court has had the opportunity to consider\nthe claims in the criminal context.\n   A tolling principle certainly seems to me to create\ngreater order than the rule the majority sets out, whereby\nall criminal defendants must file their \u00a71983 suits imme\ndiately, some will be stayed, some dismissed, and then\nsome may be refiled and entitled to tolling, ante, at 10,\nn. 4. The majority acknowledges that tolling may be\n                  Cite as: 549 U.

Why not simply apply that tolling\nprinciple across the board?\n   The majority is also wrong when it suggests that the\nproposed equitable tolling rule would create a significant\nproblem of lack of notice. Ante, at 12. Because the rule\nwould toll only while the potential \u00a71983 plaintiff is chal\nlenging the alleged misconduct in a state court, the State\nitself would have notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claims. For similar\nreasons, the potential individual \u00a71983 defendants, the\nstate officers, would also likely have notice of the charge.\nBut even if they do not, I believe that many would prefer to\nforgo immediate notice, for it comes with a pricetag at\ntached\u2014the price consists of being immediately sued by the\nfiling of a \u00a71983 lawsuit, rife with stays and delays, which\notherwise, in the course of time (as claims are winnowed in\nstate court) might never have been filed.\n   The Court\u2019s suggested limitations system, like an equita\nble tolling rule, will produce some instances in which a\nplaintiff will file a \u00a71983 lawsuit at an initially uncertain\nfuture date. Ante, at 10, n. 4. And, under both approaches,\nin the many \u00a71983 suits that do not involve any Heck bar, a\ndefendant can and will file immediately and his suit would\nproceed (for there is no tolling unless the potential \u00a71983\nplaintiff is asserting in a conviction challenge that a consti\ntutional violation did impugn his conviction). My problem\nwith the Court\u2019s approach lies in its insistence that all\npotential plaintiffs (including those whose suits may be\nHeck barred) file immediately\u2014even though their suits\ncannot then proceed. With tolling, only rarely would a\nplaintiff choose to file a potentially Heck-barred \u00a71983 suit\nwhile his criminal case is pending; and in those cases the\ndistrict court could, if it wished, stay the action, or simply\ndismiss the suit without prejudice, secure in the knowl\nedge that the suit could be timely filed at a later date.\n   The Court\u2019s refusal to admit the equitable tolling possi\n6                    WALLACE v. KATO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nbility means that large numbers of defendants will be sued\nimmediately by all potential \u00a71983 plaintiffs with arguable\nHeck issues, no matter how meritless the claims; these\nsuits may be endlessly stayed or dismissed and then, at\nsome point in the future, some defendants will also be sued\nagain. With equitable tolling, however, defendants will be\nsued once, in suits with constitutional claims that a state\ncourt has not already found meritless, at a time when the\nsuit can be promptly litigated. Given the practical difficul\nties of the Court\u2019s approach, I would not rule out now, in\nadvance, the use of an equitable tolling rule along the lines\nI have described.\n   Because this matter has not been fully argued, I would\nvacate the Seventh Circuit\u2019s determination and remand\nfor consideration of the issues I here raise. For these\nreasons, I respectfully dissent.\n",

We decide whether his suit is timely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On January 17, 1994, John Handy was shot to death in the city of Chicago. Sometime around 8 p.m. two days later, Chicago police officers located petitioner, then 15 years of age, and transported him to a police station for questioning. After interrogations that lasted into the early morning hours the next day, petitioner agreed to confess to Handy's murder. An assistant state's attorney prepared a statement to this effect, and petitioner signed it, at the same time waiving his <i>Miranda</i> rights.</p>\n<p>Prior to trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County, petitioner unsuccessfully attempted to suppress his station house statements as the product of an unlawful arrest. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 26 years in prison. On direct appeal, the Appellate Court of Illinois held that officers had arrested petitioner without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. <i>People v.

After another round of appeals, the Appellate Court concluded on August 31, 2001, that the effect of petitioner's illegal arrest had not been sufficiently attenuated to render his statements admissible, see <i>Brown v.

On April 10, 2002, prosecutors dropped the charges against petitioner.</p>\n<p>On April 2, 2003, petitioner filed this \u00a7 1983 suit against the city of Chicago and several Chicago police officers, seeking damages arising from, <i>inter alia,</i> his unlawful arrest.<sup>[1]</sup> The District Court granted summary judgment to respondents and the Court of Appeals affirmed. According to the Seventh Circuit, petitioner's \u00a7 1983 suit was time barred because his cause of action accrued at the time of his arrest, and not when his conviction was later set aside. <i>Wallace v.

This is so for the length of the statute of limitations: It is that which the State provides for personal-injury torts. <i>Owens v. Okure,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112166\"><a href=\"/opinion/112166/owens-v-okure/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span>, 249-250, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989); <i>Wilson v.

Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 735, \u00a7 5/13-202 (West 2003). Thus, if the statute on petitioner's cause of action began to run at the time of his unlawful arrest, or even at the time he was ordered held by a magistrate, his \u00a7 1983 suit was plainly dilatory, even according him tolling for the two-plus years of his minority, see \u00a7 5/13-211. But if, as the dissenting judge argued below, the commencement date for running of the statute is governed by this Court's decision in <i>Heck v. Humphrey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117864\"><a href=\"/opinion/117864/heck-v-humphrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span>, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), that date <i>may</i> be the date on which petitioner's conviction was vacated, in which case the \u00a7 1983 suit would have been timely filed.</p>\n<p>While we have never stated so expressly, the accrual date of a \u00a7 1983 cause of action is a question of federal law that is <i>not</i> resolved by reference to state law. The parties agree, the Seventh Circuit in this case so held, see 440 F.3d, at 424, and we are aware of no federal court of appeals holding to the contrary. Aspects of \u00a7 1983 which are not governed by reference to state law are governed by federal rules conforming in general to common-law tort principles. See <i>Heck, supra,</i> at 483, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <i>Carey v. Piphus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109815\"><a href=\"/opinion/109815/carey-v-piphus/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>, 257-258, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978). Under those principles, it is \"the standard rule that [accrual occurs] when the plaintiff has `a complete and present cause of action.'\" <i>Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118159\"><a href=\"/opinion/118159/bay-area-laundry-and-dry-cleaning-pension-trust-fu/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 201, 118 S.Ct. 542, 139 L.Ed.2d 553 (1997) (quoting <i>Rawlings v. Ray,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103441\"><a href=\"/opinion/103441/rawlings-v-ray/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 98, 61 S.Ct. 473, 85 L.Ed. 605 (1941)), that is, when \"the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief,\" <i>Bay Area Laundry, supra,</i> at 201, 118 S.Ct. 542. There can be no dispute that petitioner could have filed suit as soon as the allegedly wrongful arrest occurred, subjecting him to the harm of involuntary detention, so the statute of limitations would normally commence to run from that date.</p>\n<p>There is, however, a refinement to be considered, arising from the common law's distinctive treatment of the torts of false arrest and false imprisonment, \"[t]he. . . cause[s] of action [that] provid[e] the closest analogy to claims of the type considered here,\" <i>Heck, supra,</i> at 484, 114 S.Ct. 2364. See 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Torts \u00a7 47, p. 88 (2001). False arrest and false imprisonment overlap; the former is a species of the latter. \"Every confinement of the person is an imprisonment, whether it be in a common prison or in a private house, or in the stocks, or even by forcibly detaining one in the public streets; and when a man is lawfully in a house, it is imprisonment to prevent him from leaving the room in which he is.\" M. Newell, Law of Malicious Prosecution, False Imprisonment, and Abuse of Legal Process \u00a7 2, p. 57 (1892) (footnotes omitted). See also 7 S. Speiser, C. Krause, &amp; A. Gans, American Law of Torts \u00a7 27:2, pp. 940-942 (1990). We shall thus refer to the two torts together as false imprisonment. That tort provides the proper analogy to the cause of action asserted against the present respondents for the following reason: The sort of unlawful detention remediable by the tort of false imprisonment is detention <i>without legal process,</i> see, <i>e.g.,</i> W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7 11, p. 54, \u00a7 119, pp. 885-886 (5th ed.1984); 7 Speiser, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 27:2, at 943-944, and the allegations before us arise from respondents' detention of petitioner <i>without legal process</i> in January 1994. They did not have a warrant for his arrest.</p>\n<p>The running of the statute of limitations on false imprisonment is subject to a distinctive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1096</span> rule\u0097dictated, perhaps, by the reality that the victim may not be able to sue while he is still imprisoned: \"Limitations begin to run against an action for false imprisonment when the alleged false imprisonment ends.\" 2 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions \u00a7 187d(4), p. 878 (4th rev. ed.1916); see also 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 899, Comment <i>c</i> (1977); A. Underhill, Principles of Law of Torts 202 (1881). Thus, to determine the beginning of the limitations period in this case, we must determine when petitioner's false imprisonment came to an end.</p>\n<p>Reflective of the fact that false imprisonment consists of detention without legal process, a false imprisonment ends once the victim becomes held <i>pursuant to such process</i>\u0097when, for example, he is bound over by a magistrate or arraigned on charges. Dobbs, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 39, at 74, n. 2; Keeton, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 119, at 888; H. Stephen, Actions for Malicious Prosecution 120-123 (1888). Thereafter, unlawful detention forms part of the damages for the \"entirely distinct\" tort of malicious prosecution, which remedies detention accompanied, not by absence of legal process, but by <i>wrongful institution</i> of legal process.<sup>[2]</sup> Keeton, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 119, at 885-886; see 1 F. Harper, F. James, &amp; O. Gray, Law of Torts \u00a7 3.9, p. 3:36 (3d ed.1996); 7 Speiser, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 27:2, at 943-945. \"If there is a false arrest claim, damages for that claim cover the time of detention up until issuance of process or arraignment, but not more. From that point on, any damages recoverable must be based on a malicious prosecution claim and on the wrongful use of judicial process rather than detention itself.\" Keeton, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 119, at 888; see also <i>Heck, supra,</i> at 484, 114 S.Ct. 2364; 8 Speiser, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 28:15, at 80. Thus, petitioner's contention that his false imprisonment ended upon his release from custody, after the State dropped the charges against him, must be rejected. It ended much earlier, when legal process was initiated against him, and the statute would have begun to run from that date, but for its tolling by reason of petitioner's minority.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Petitioner asserts that the date of his release from custody must be the relevant date in the circumstances of the present suit, since he is seeking damages up to that time. The theory of his complaint is that the initial Fourth Amendment violation set the wheels in motion for his subsequent conviction and detention: The unlawful arrest led to the coerced confession, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1097</span> which was introduced at his trial, producing his conviction and incarceration. As we have just explained, at common law damages for detention after issuance of process or arraignment would be attributable to a tort other than the unlawful arrest alleged in petitioner's complaint\u0097and probably a tort chargeable to defendants other than the respondents here. Even assuming, however, that all damages for detention pursuant to legal process could be regarded as consequential damages attributable to the unlawful arrest, that would not alter the commencement date for the statute of limitations. \"Under the traditional rule of accrual . . . the tort cause of action accrues, and the statute of limitations commences to run, when the wrongful act or omission results in damages. The cause of action accrues even though the full extent of the injury is not then known or predictable.\" 1 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions \u00a7 7.4.1, pp. 526-527 (1991) (footnotes omitted); see also 54 C.J.S., Limitations of Actions \u00a7 112, p. 150 (2005). Were it otherwise, the statute would begin to run only after a plaintiff became satisfied that he had been harmed enough, placing the supposed statute of repose in the sole hands of the party seeking relief.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the statute of limitations on petitioner's \u00a7 1983 claim commenced to run when he appeared before the examining magistrate and was bound over for trial. Since more than two years elapsed between that date and the filing of this suit\u0097even leaving out of the count the period before he reached his majority\u0097the action was time barred.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>This would end the matter, were it not for petitioner's contention that <i>Heck v. Humphrey,</i> 512 U.S., at 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, compels the conclusion that his suit could not accrue until the State dropped its charges against him. In <i>Heck,</i> a state prisoner filed suit under \u00a7 1983 raising claims which, if true, would have established the invalidity of his outstanding conviction. We analogized his suit to one for malicious prosecution, an element of which is the favorable termination of criminal proceedings. <i>Id.,</i> at 484, 114 S.Ct. 2364. We said:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[I]n order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has <i>not</i> been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 486-487[, 114 S.Ct. 2364] (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>We rested this conclusion upon \"the hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 486, 114 S.Ct. 2364. \"`Congress,'\" we said, \"`has determined that habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or length of their confinement, and that specific determination must override the general terms of \u00a7 1983.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 482, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (quoting <i>Preiser v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108772\"><a href=\"/opinion/108772/preiser-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, 490, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973)).</p>\n<p>As the above excerpts show, the <i>Heck</i> rule for deferred accrual is called into play only when there exists \"a conviction or sentence that has <i>not</i> been . . . invalidated,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1098</span> that is to say, an \"outstanding criminal judgment.\" It delays what would otherwise be the accrual date of a tort action until the setting aside <i>of an extant conviction</i> which success in that tort action would impugn. We assume that, for purposes of the present tort action, the <i>Heck</i> principle would be applied not to the date of accrual but to the date on which the statute of limitations began to run, that is, the date petitioner became held pursuant to legal process. See <i>supra,</i> at 1095-1096. Even at that later time, there was in existence no criminal conviction that the cause of action would impugn; indeed, there may not even have been an indictment.</p>\n<p>What petitioner seeks, in other words, is the adoption of a principle that goes well beyond <i>Heck:</i> that an action which would impugn <i>an anticipated future conviction</i> cannot be brought until that conviction occurs and is set aside. The impracticality of such a rule should be obvious. In an action for false arrest it would require the plaintiff (and if he brings suit promptly, the court) to speculate about whether a prosecution will be brought, whether it will result in conviction, and whether the pending civil action will impugn that verdict, see <i>Heck,</i> 512 U.S., at 487, n. 7, 114 S.Ct. 2364 \u0097 all this at a time when it can hardly be known what evidence the prosecution has in its possession. And what if the plaintiff (or the court) guesses wrong, and the anticipated future conviction never occurs, because of acquittal or dismissal? Does that event (instead of the <i>Heck</i>-required setting aside of the extant conviction) trigger accrual of the cause of action? Or what if prosecution never occurs\u0097what will the trigger be then?</p>\n<p>We are not disposed to embrace this bizarre extension of <i>Heck.</i> If a plaintiff files a false arrest claim before he has been convicted (or files any other claim related to rulings that will likely be made in a pending or anticipated criminal trial), it is within the power of the district court, and in accord with common practice, to stay the civil action until the criminal case or the likelihood of a criminal case is ended. See <i>id.,</i> at 487-488, n. 8, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (noting that \"abstention may be an appropriate response to the parallel state-court proceedings\"); <i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 730, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996). If the plaintiff is ultimately convicted, and if the stayed civil suit would impugn that conviction, <i>Heck</i> will require dismissal; otherwise, the civil action will proceed, absent some other bar to suit. <i>Edwards v. Balisok,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118112\"><a href=\"/opinion/118112/edwards-v-balisok/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 649, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <i>Heck,</i> 512 U.S., at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p>There is, however, one complication that we must address here. It arises from the fact that \u00a7 1983 actions, unlike the tort of malicious prosecution which <i>Heck</i> took as its model, see <i>id.,</i> at 484, 114 S.Ct. 2364, sometimes accrue before the setting aside of\u0097indeed, even before the existence of\u0097 the related criminal conviction. That of course is the case here, and it raises the question whether, assuming that the <i>Heck</i> bar takes effect when the later conviction is obtained, the statute of limitations on the once valid cause of action is tolled as long as the <i>Heck</i> bar subsists. In the context of the present case: If petitioner's conviction on April 19, 1996, caused the statute of limitations on his (possibly) impugning but yet-to-be-filed cause of action to be tolled until that conviction was set aside, his filing here would have been timely.</p>\n<p>We have generally referred to state law for tolling rules, just as we have for the length of statutes of limitation. <i>Hardin v. Straub,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112265\"><a href=\"/opinion/112265/hardin-v-straub/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span>, 538-539, 109 S.Ct. 1998, 104 L.Ed.2d 582 (1989); <i>Board</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1099</span> <i>of Regents of Univ. of State of N.Y. v. Tomanio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110261\"><a href=\"/opinion/110261/board-of-regents-of-univ-of-state-of-ny-v-tomanio/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 484-486, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980). Petitioner has not brought to our attention, nor are we aware of, Illinois cases providing tolling in even remotely comparable circumstances. (Indeed, petitioner did not even argue for such tolling below, though he supported its suggestion at oral argument.) Nor would we be inclined to adopt a federal tolling rule to this effect. Under such a regime, it would not be known whether tolling is appropriate by reason of the <i>Heck</i> bar until it is established that the newly entered conviction would be impugned by the not-yet-filed, and thus utterly indeterminate, \u00a7 1983 claim.<sup>[4]</sup> It would hardly be desirable to place the question of tolling <i>vel non</i> in this jurisprudential limbo, leaving it to be determined by those later events, and then pronouncing it retroactively. Defendants need to be on notice to preserve beyond the normal limitations period evidence that will be needed for their defense; and a statute that becomes retroactively extended, by the action of the plaintiff in crafting a conviction-impugning cause of action, is hardly a statute of repose.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Justice BREYER argues in dissent that equitable tolling should apply \"so long as the issues that [a \u00a7 1983] claim would raise are being pursued in state court.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1104. We know of no support (nor <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1100</span> does the dissent suggest any) for the far-reaching proposition that equitable tolling is appropriate to avoid the risk of concurrent litigation. As best we can tell, the only rationale for such a rule is the concern that \"petitioner would have had to divide his attention between criminal and civil cases.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1102. But when has it been the law that a criminal defendant, or a potential criminal defendant, is absolved from all other responsibilities that the law would otherwise place upon him? If a defendant has a breach-of-contract claim against the prime contractor for his new home, is he entitled to tolling for that as well while his criminal case is pending? Equitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual circumstances, not a cure-all for an entirely common state of affairs. Besides its never-heard-of-before quality, the dissent's proposal suffers from a more ironic flaw. Although the dissent criticizes us for having to develop a system of stays and dismissals, it should be obvious that the omnibus tolling solution will require the same. Despite the existence of the new tolling rule, some (if not most) plaintiffs will nevertheless file suit before or during state criminal proceedings. How does the dissent propose to handle such suits? Finally, the dissent's contention that law enforcement officers would prefer the possibility of a later \u00a7 1983 suit to the more likely reality of an immediate filing, <i>post</i> at 1104, is both implausible and contradicted by those who know best. As no fewer than 11 States have informed us in this litigation, \"States and municipalities have a strong interest in timely notice of alleged misconduct by their agents.\" Brief for State of Illinois et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 18.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We hold that the statute of limitations upon a \u00a7 1983 claim seeking damages for a false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, where the arrest is followed by criminal proceedings, begins to run at the time the claimant becomes detained pursuant to legal process. Since in the present case this occurred (with appropriate tolling for the plaintiff's minority) more than two years before the complaint was filed, the suit was out of time. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice SOUTER joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>While I do not disagree with the Court's conclusion, I reach it by a more direct route. The alleged Fourth Amendment violation at issue in this case had two distinct consequences for petitioner: First, it provided him with a federal cause of action for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and second, it provided him with an objection to the admissibility of certain evidence in his state criminal trial. The crux of petitioner's argument before this Court is that <i>Heck v. Humphrey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117864\"><a href=\"/opinion/117864/heck-v-humphrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span>, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), provides the appropriate rule of accrual for his \u00a7 1983 claim. As both he and the majority note, <i>Heck</i> held that</p>\n<blockquote>\"in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. . . . Thus, when a state prisoner seeks damages in a \u00a7 1983 suit, the district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1101</span> plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 486-487[, 114 S.Ct. 2364] (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Relying on this principle, petitioner contends that his federal cause of action did not accrue until after the criminal charges against him were dropped.</p>\n<p>Unlike the majority, my analysis would not depend on any common-law tort analogies.<sup>[1]</sup> Instead, I would begin where all nine Justices began in <i>Heck.</i> That case, we unanimously agreed, required the Court to reconcile \u00a7 1983 with the federal habeas corpus statute.<sup>[2]</sup> In concluding that Heck's damages claim was not cognizable under \u00a7 1983, we found that the writ of habeas corpus, and not \u00a7 1983, affords the \"`appropriate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or length of their confinement.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 482, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (quoting <i>Preiser v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108772\"><a href=\"/opinion/108772/preiser-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, 490, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973)). Given our holding in <i>Stone v. Powell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109540\"><a href=\"/opinion/109540/stone-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 481-482, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), however, that writ cannot provide a remedy for this petitioner. And because a habeas remedy was never available to him in the first place, <i>Heck</i> cannot postpone the accrual of petitioner's \u00a7 1983 Fourth Amendment claim.<sup>[3]</sup> So while it may well be appropriate to stay the trial of claims of this kind until after the completion of state proceedings, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 731, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996); cf. <i>Younger v.

It eschews my reasoning because \"[f]ederal habeas petitioners have <i>sometimes</i> succeeded in arguing that <i>Stone's</i> general prohibition does not apply.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1099, n. 5 (emphasis added). However, in the vast run of cases, a State will provide a habeas petitioner with \"an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim,\" <i>Stone,</i> 428 U.S., at 482, 96 S.Ct. 3037, and <i>Heck</i> will not apply. It is always possible to find aberrant examples in the law, but we should not craft rules for the needle rather than the haystack in an area like this.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that the accrual date of a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim is not postponed by the presence of a possible bar to suit under <i>Heck v. Humphrey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117864\"><a href=\"/opinion/117864/heck-v-humphrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span>, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). I also agree with the rest of the Court and with Justice STEVENS that had petitioner timely filed his \u00a7 1983 case, the Federal District Court might have found it appropriate to stay the trial of his claims until the completion of state proceedings. <i>E.g., </i><i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 731, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996). In the absence of a stay, a litigant like petitioner would have had to divide his attention between criminal and civil cases with attendant risks of loss of time and energy as well as of inconsistent findings.</p>\n<p>The Court's holding, however, simply leads to the question of what is to happen when, for example, the possibility of a <i>Heck</i> problem prevents the court from considering the merits of a \u00a7 1983 claim. And I disagree with the Court's insistence upon a rule of law that would require immediate filing, followed by an uncertain system of stays, dismissals, and possible refiling. <i>Ante,</i> at 1099, n. 4 (majority opinion); <i>ante,</i> at 1101-1102 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). I disagree because there is a well-established legal tool better able to deal with the problems presented by this type of suit.</p>\n<p>Where a \"plaintiff because of disability, irremediable lack of information, or other circumstances beyond his control just cannot reasonably be expected to sue in time,\" courts have applied a doctrine of \"equitable tolling.\" <i>Miller v. Runyon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"713067\"><a href=\"/opinion/713067/john-t-miller-and-amf-ohare-midway-local-7011-loca/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span>, 191 (C.A.7 1996) (Posner, C.J.). The doctrine tolls the running of the limitations period until the disabling circumstance can be overcome. (This is why the limitations period does not run against a falsely arrested person until his false imprisonment ends. His action has certainly accrued because, as the majority recognizes, he can file his claim immediately if he is able to do so. <i>Ante,</i> at 1095-1096, n. 3.) 77 F.3d, at 191; see also <i>Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></span>, 450-453 (C.A.7 1990).</p>\n<p>In particular, equitable tolling could apply where a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff reasonably claims that the unlawful behavior of which he complains was, or will be, necessary to a criminal conviction. It could toll the running of the limitations period: (1) from the time charges are brought until the time they are dismissed or the defendant is acquitted or convicted, and (2) thereafter during any period in which the criminal defendant challenges a conviction (on direct appeal, on state collateral challenge, or on federal habeas) and reasonably asserts the behavior underlying the \u00a7 1983 action as a ground for overturning the conviction.</p>\n<p>I find it difficult to understand why the Court rejects the use of \"equitable tolling\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1103</span> in regard to typical \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs. <i>Ante,</i> at 1098-1099. The Court's alternative\u0097file all \u00a7 1983 claims (including potentially <i>Heck</i>-barred claims) at once and then seek stays or be subject to dismissal and refiling\u0097suffers serious practical disadvantages. For one thing, that approach would force all potential criminal defendants to file all potential \u00a7 1983 actions soon lest they lose those claims due to protracted criminal proceedings. For another, it would often require a federal court, seeking to determine whether to dismiss an action as <i>Heck</i> barred or to grant a stay, to consider issues likely being litigated in the criminal proceeding (Was the Constitution violated? Was the violation-related evidence necessary for conviction?). The federal court's decision as to whether a claim was <i>Heck</i> barred (say, whether the alleged constitutional violation was central to the state criminal conviction) might later bind a state court on conviction review. Because of this, even a claim without a likely <i>Heck</i> bar might linger on a federal docket because the federal court (or the plaintiff who has been forced to early file) wishes to avoid interfering with any state proceedings and therefore must postpone reaching, not only the merits of the \u00a7 1983 claim, but the threshold <i>Heck</i> inquiry as well.</p>\n<p>Principles of equitable tolling avoid these difficulties. Since equitable tolling obviates the need for immediate filing, it permits the criminal proceedings to winnow the constitutional wheat from chaff, and thereby increase the likelihood that the constitutionally meritless claims will never (in a \u00a7 1983 action) see the light of day. See <i>Allen v. McCurry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 95-96, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980) (federal court gives preclusive effect to constitutional determinations as to issues already litigated in state court). Moreover, an appropriate equitable tolling principle would apply not only to state criminal proceedings as here, but also to state appellate proceedings, state collateral attacks, and federal <i>habeas</i> proceedings.</p>\n<p>Of course, \u00a7 1983 ordinarily borrows its limitations principles from state law. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(a). And I do not know whether or which States have comparable equitable tolling principles in place. If a given state court lacks the necessary tolling provision, however, \u00a7 1983, in my view, permits the federal courts to devise and impose such principles. See <i>Hardin v. Straub,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112265\"><a href=\"/opinion/112265/hardin-v-straub/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span>, 538-540, 109 S.Ct. 1998, 104 L.Ed.2d 582 (1989) (\"[G]aps in federal civil rights acts should be filled by state law, as long as that law is not inconsistent with federal law\" and its \"chief goals of compensation and deterrence or its subsidiary goals of uniformity and federalism\" (footnote omitted)); <i>Heck v. Humphrey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610636\"><a href=\"/opinion/610636/roy-heck-v-james-humphrey-dearborn-county-prosecut/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span>, 358 (C.A.7 1993) (Posner, J.) (articulating why federal tolling regime may apply to \u00a7 1983 claims), aff'd on other grounds, 512 U.S., at 489, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Cf. <i>Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N.Y. v. Tomanio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110261\"><a href=\"/opinion/110261/board-of-regents-of-univ-of-state-of-ny-v-tomanio/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 490, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980).</p>\n<p>The use of equitable tolling in cases of potential temporal conflict between civil \u00a7 1983 and related criminal proceedings is consistent with, indeed, it would further, \u00a7 1983's basic purposes. It would provide for orderly adjudication, minimize the risk of inconsistent legal determinations, avoid clogging the courts with potentially unnecessary \"protective\" filings, and, above all, assure a plaintiff who possesses a meritorious \u00a7 1983 claim that his pursuit of criminal remedies designed to free him from unlawful confinement will not compromise his later ability to obtain civil \u00a7 1983 redress as well.</p>\n<p>The Court is wrong in concluding that the principle I have described would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1104</span> \"place\" the tolling \"question\" in \"jurisprudential limbo.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1099. Under the approach I propose, <i>supra,</i> at 1102-1103, a potential \u00a7 1983 plaintiff knows his claim is being tolled so long as the issues that claim would raise are being pursued in state court. Such a rule is prophylactic (it will sometimes toll claims that would not be barred by <i>Heck</i>), but under such an approach neither the plaintiff, nor the defendant, nor the federal court need speculate as to whether the claims are in any way barred until the state court has had the opportunity to consider the claims in the criminal context.</p>\n<p>A tolling principle certainly seems to me to create greater order than the rule the majority sets out, whereby all criminal defendants must file their \u00a7 1983 suits immediately, some will be stayed, some dismissed, and then some may be refiled and entitled to tolling, <i>ante,</i> at 1099, n. 4. The majority acknowledges that tolling may be necessary to protect the plaintiff who previously filed and was dismissed. <i>Ibid.</i> Why not simply apply that tolling principle across the board?</p>\n<p>The majority is also wrong when it suggests that the proposed equitable tolling rule would create a significant problem of lack of notice. <i>Ante,</i> at 1100. Because the rule would toll only while the potential \u00a7 1983 plaintiff is challenging the alleged misconduct in a state court, the State itself would have notice of the plaintiff's claims. For similar reasons, the potential individual \u00a7 1983 defendants, the state officers, would also likely have notice of the charge. But even if they do not, I believe that many would prefer to forgo immediate notice, for it comes with a pricetag attached\u0097the price consists of being immediately sued by the filing of a \u00a7 1983 lawsuit, rife with stays and delays, which otherwise, in the course of time (as claims are winnowed in state court) might never have been filed.</p>\n<p>The Court's suggested limitations system, like an equitable tolling rule, will produce some instances in which a plaintiff will file a \u00a7 1983 lawsuit at an initially uncertain future date. <i>Ante,</i> at 1099, n. 4. And, under both approaches, in the many \u00a7 1983 suits that do not involve any <i>Heck</i> bar, a defendant can and will file immediately and his suit would proceed (for there is no tolling unless the potential \u00a7 1983 plaintiff is asserting in a conviction challenge that a constitutional violation did impugn his conviction). My problem with the Court's approach lies in its insistence that all potential plaintiffs (including those whose suits may be <i>Heck</i> barred) file immediately\u0097even though their suits cannot then proceed. With tolling, only rarely would a plaintiff choose to file a potentially <i>Heck</i>-barred \u00a7 1983 suit while his criminal case is pending; and in those cases the district court could, if it wished, stay the action, or simply dismiss the suit without prejudice, secure in the knowledge that the suit could be timely filed at a later date.</p>\n<p>The Court's refusal to admit the equitable tolling possibility means that large numbers of defendants will be sued immediately by all potential \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs with arguable <i>Heck</i> issues, no matter how meritless the claims; these suits may be endlessly stayed or dismissed and then, at some point in the future, some defendants will also be sued again. With equitable tolling, however, defendants will be sued once, in suits with constitutional claims that a state court has not already found meritless, at a time when the suit can be promptly litigated. Given the practical difficulties of the Court's approach, I would not rule out now, in advance, the use of an equitable tolling rule along the lines I have described.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1105</span> Because this matter has not been fully argued, I would vacate the Seventh Circuit's determination and remand for consideration of the issues I here raise. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  All of petitioner's other state and federal claims were resolved adversely to him and are not before us. We expressly limited our grant of certiorari to the Fourth Amendment false-arrest claim. See 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2891 (2006). The city of Chicago is no longer a party to this suit.</p>\n<p>[2]  We have never explored the contours of a Fourth Amendment malicious-prosecution suit under \u00a7 1983, see <i>Albright v. Oliver,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112924\"><a href=\"/opinion/112924/albright-v-oliver/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 270-271, 275, 114 S.Ct. 807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994) (plurality opinion), and we do not do so here. See generally 1 M. Schwartz, Section 1983 Litigation \u00a7 3.18[C], pp. 3-605 to 3-629 (4th ed.2004) (noting a range of approaches in the lower courts). Assuming without deciding that such a claim is cognizable under \u00a7 1983, petitioner has not made one. Petitioner did not include such a claim in his complaint. He in fact abandoned a state-law malicious-prosecution claim in the District Court, and stated, in his opposition to respondents' first motion for summary judgment, that \"Plaintiff does not seek to raise . . . a malicious prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983,\" Record, Doc. 17, p. 3, n. 5. In this Court, he has told us that respondents are \"mistaken in characterizing petitioner's cause of action as involving `unwarranted prosecution.'\" Reply Brief 12.</p>\n<p>[3]  This is not to say, of course, that petitioner could not have filed suit immediately upon his false arrest. While the statute of limitations did not begin to run until petitioner became detained pursuant to legal process, he was injured and suffered damages at the moment of his arrest, and was entitled to bring suit at that time. See <i>Adler v. Beverly Hills Hospital,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1632275\"><a href=\"/opinion/1632275/adler-v-beverly-hills-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 156 (Tex.Civ.App.1980) (\"We may concede that a person falsely imprisoned has the right to sue on the first day for his detention\").</p>\n<p>[4]  Had petitioner filed suit upon his arrest and had his suit then been dismissed under <i>Heck,</i> the statute of limitations, absent tolling, would have run by the time he obtained reversal of his conviction. If under those circumstances he were not allowed to refile his suit, <i>Heck</i> would produce immunity from \u00a7 1983 liability, a result surely not intended. Because in the present case petitioner did not file his suit within the limitations period, we need not decide, had he done so, how much time he would have had to refile the suit once the <i>Heck</i> bar was removed.</p>\n<p>[5]  Justice STEVENS reaches the same result by arguing that, under <i>Stone v. Powell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109540\"><a href=\"/opinion/109540/stone-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), the <i>Heck</i> bar can never come into play in a \u00a7 1983 suit seeking damages for a Fourth Amendment violation, so that \"a habeas remedy was never available to [petitioner] in the first place.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1101 (opinion concurring in judgment). This reads <i>Stone</i> to say more than it does. Under <i>Stone,</i> Fourth Amendment violations are <i>generally</i> not cognizable on federal habeas, but they <i>are</i> cognizable when the State has failed to provide the habeas petitioner \"an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim.\" 428 U.S., at 482, 96 S.Ct. 3037. Federal habeas petitioners have sometimes succeeded in arguing that <i>Stone's</i> general prohibition does not apply. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Herrera v.

At the time of a Fourth Amendment wrong, and at the time of conviction, it cannot be known whether a prospective \u00a7 1983 plaintiff will receive a full and fair opportunity to litigate his Fourth Amendment claim. It thus remains the case that a conflict with the federal habeas statute is possible, that a Fourth Amendment claim can necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction, and that if it does it must, under <i>Heck,</i> be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p>Insofar as Justice STEVENS simply suggests that <i>Heck</i> has no bearing here because <i>petitioner</i> received a full and fair opportunity to litigate his Fourth Amendment claim in state court, the argument is equally untenable. At the time that petitioner became detained pursuant to legal process, it was impossible to predict whether this would be true. And even at the point when his limitations period ended, state proceedings on his conviction were ongoing; full and fair opportunity up to that point was not enough. <i>Stone</i> requires full and fair opportunity to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim \"at trial <i>and on direct review.</i>\" 428 U.S., at 494-495, n. 37, 96 S.Ct. 3037 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[1]  See <i>Heck,</i> 512 U.S., at 492, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment) (\"Common-law tort rules can provide a `starting point for the inquiry under \u00a7 1983,' <i>Carey v.
