Clarke, Portland, OR, for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question we address today concerns a large state-court punitive damages award. We are asked whether the Constitution's Due Process Clause permits a jury to base that award in part upon its desire to <i>punish</i> the defendant for harming persons who are not before the court (<i>e.g.,</i> victims whom the parties do not represent). We hold that such an award would amount to a taking of \"property\" from the defendant without due process.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>This lawsuit arises out of the death of Jesse Williams, a heavy cigarette smoker. Respondent, Williams' widow, represents his estate in this state lawsuit for negligence and deceit against Philip Morris, the manufacturer of Marlboro, the brand that Williams favored. A jury found that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1061</span> Williams' death was caused by smoking; that Williams smoked in significant part because he thought it was safe to do so; and that Philip Morris knowingly and falsely led him to believe that this was so. The jury ultimately found that Philip Morris was negligent (as was Williams) and that Philip Morris had engaged in deceit. In respect to deceit, the claim at issue here, it awarded compensatory damages of about $821,000 (about $21,000 economic and $800,000 noneconomic) along with $79.5 million in punitive damages.</p>\n<p>The trial judge subsequently found the $79.5 million punitive damages award \"excessive,\" see, <i>e.g., </i><i>BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore,</i> 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996), and reduced it to $32 million. Both sides appealed. The Oregon Court of Appeals rejected Philip Morris' arguments and restored the $79.5 million jury award. Subsequently, Philip Morris sought review in the Oregon Supreme Court (which denied review) and then here. We remanded the case in light of <i>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell,</i> 538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003). 540 U.S. 801, 124 S.Ct. 56, 157 L.Ed.2d 12 (2003). The Oregon Court of Appeals adhered to its original views. And Philip Morris sought, and this time obtained, review in the Oregon Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Philip Morris then made two arguments relevant here. First, it said that the trial court should have accepted, but did not accept, a proposed \"punitive damages\" instruction that specified the jury could not seek to punish Philip Morris for injury to other persons not before the court. In particular, Philip Morris pointed out that the plaintiff's attorney had told the jury to \"think about how many other Jesse Williams in the last 40 years in the State of Oregon there have been. ... In Oregon, how many people do we see outside, driving home ... smoking cigarettes? ... [C]igarettes ... are going to kill ten [of every hundred]. [And] the market share of Marlboros [<i>i.e.,</i> Philip Morris] is one-third [<i>i.e.,</i> one of every three killed].\" App. 197a, 199a. In light of this argument, Philip Morris asked the trial court to tell the jury that \"you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what [the] reasonable relationship is\" between any punitive award and \"the harm caused to Jesse Williams\" by Philip Morris' misconduct, \"[but] you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons, who may bring lawsuits of their own in which other juries can resolve their claims ....\" <i>Id.,</i> at 280a. The judge rejected this proposal and instead told the jury that \"[p]unitive damages are awarded against a defendant to punish misconduct and to deter misconduct,\" and \"are not intended to compensate the plaintiff or anyone else for damages caused by the defendant's conduct.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 283a. In Philip Morris' view, the result was a significant likelihood that a portion of the $79.5 million award represented punishment for its having harmed others, a punishment that the Due Process Clause would here forbid.</p>\n<p>Second, Philip Morris pointed to the roughly 100-to-1 ratio the $79.5 million punitive damages award bears to $821,000 in compensatory damages. Philip Morris noted that this Court in <i>BMW</i> emphasized the constitutional need for punitive damages awards to reflect (1) the \"reprehensibility\" of the defendant's conduct, (2) a \"reasonable relationship\" to the harm the plaintiff (or related victim) suffered, and (3) the presence (or absence) of \"sanctions,\" <i>e.g.,</i> criminal penalties, that state law provided for comparable conduct, 517 U.S., at 575-585, 116 S.Ct. 1589. And in <i>State Farm,</i> this Court said that the longstanding historical practice of setting punitive damages at two, three, or four times <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1062</span> the size of compensatory damages, while \"not binding,\" is \"instructive,\" and that \"[s]ingle-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process.\" 538 U.S., at 425, 123 S.Ct. 1513. Philip Morris claimed that, in light of this case law, the punitive award was \"grossly excessive.\" See <i>TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp.,</i> 509 U.S. 443, 458, 113 S.Ct. 2711, 125 L.Ed.2d 366 (1993) (plurality opinion); <i>BMW, supra,</i> at 574-575, 116 S.Ct. 1589; <i>State Farm, supra,</i> at 416-417, 123 S.Ct. 1513.</p>\n<p>The Oregon Supreme Court rejected these and other Philip Morris arguments. In particular, it rejected Philip Morris' claim that the Constitution prohibits a state jury \"from using punitive damages to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties.\" 340 Or. 35, 51-52, 127 P.3d 1165, 1175 (2006). And in light of Philip Morris' reprehensible conduct, it found that the $79.5 million award was not \"grossly excessive.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 63-64, 127 P.3d, at 1181-1182.</p>\n<p>Philip Morris then sought certiorari. It asked us to consider, among other things, (1) its claim that Oregon had unconstitutionally permitted it to be punished for harming nonparty victims; and (2) whether Oregon had in effect disregarded \"the constitutional requirement that punitive damages be reasonably related to the plaintiff's harm.\" Pet. for Cert. (I). We granted certiorari limited to these two questions.</p>\n<p>For reasons we shall set forth, we consider only the first of these questions. We vacate the Oregon Supreme Court's judgment, and we remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This Court has long made clear that \"[p]unitive damages may properly be imposed to further a State's legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition.\" <i>BMW, supra,</i> at 568, 116 S.Ct. 1589. See also <i>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,</i> 418 U.S. 323, 350, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974); <i>Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,</i> 453 U.S. 247, 266-267, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981); <i>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip,</i> 499 U.S. 1, 22, 111 S.Ct. 1032, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991). At the same time, we have emphasized the need to avoid an arbitrary determination of an award's amount. Unless a State insists upon proper standards that will cabin the jury's discretionary authority, its punitive damages system may deprive a defendant of \"fair notice ... of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose,\" <i>BMW, supra,</i> at 574, 116 S.Ct. 1589; it may threaten \"arbitrary punishments,\" <i>i.e.,</i> punishments that reflect not an \"application of law\" but \"a decisionmaker's caprice,\" <i>State Farm, supra,</i> at 416, 418, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (internal quotation marks omitted); and, where the amounts are sufficiently large, it may impose one State's (or one jury's) \"policy choice,\" say as to the conditions under which (or even whether) certain products can be sold, upon \"neighboring States\" with different public policies, <i>BMW, supra,</i> at 571-572, 116 S.Ct. 1589.</p>\n<p>For these and similar reasons, this Court has found that the Constitution imposes certain limits, in respect both to procedures for awarding punitive damages and to amounts forbidden as \"grossly excessive.\" See <i>Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg,</i> 512 U.S. 415, 432, 114 S.Ct. 2331, 129 L.Ed.2d 336 (1994) (requiring judicial review of the size of punitive awards); <i>Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc.,</i> 532 U.S. 424, 443, 121 S.Ct. 1678, 149 L.Ed.2d 674 (2001) (review must be <i>de novo</i>); <i>BMW, supra,</i> at 574-585, 116 S.Ct. 1589 (excessiveness decision depends upon the reprehensibility of the defendant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1063</span> conduct, whether the award bears a reasonable relationship to the actual and potential harm caused by the defendant to the plaintiff, and the difference between the award and sanctions \"authorized or imposed in comparable cases\"); <i>State Farm, supra,</i> at 425, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (excessiveness more likely where ratio exceeds single digits). Because we shall not decide whether the award here at issue is \"grossly excessive,\" we need now only consider the Constitution's procedural limitations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In our view, the Constitution's Due Process Clause forbids a State to use a punitive damages award to punish a defendant for injury that it inflicts upon nonparties or those whom they directly represent, <i>i.e.,</i> injury that it inflicts upon those who are, essentially, strangers to the litigation. For one thing, the Due Process Clause prohibits a State from punishing an individual without first providing that individual with \"an opportunity to present every available defense.\" <i>Lindsey v. Normet,</i> 405 U.S. 56, 66, 92 S.Ct. 862, 31 L.Ed.2d 36 (1972) (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet a defendant threatened with punishment for injuring a nonparty victim has no opportunity to defend against the charge, by showing, for example in a case such as this, that the other victim was not entitled to damages because he or she knew that smoking was dangerous or did not rely upon the defendant's statements to the contrary.</p>\n<p>For another, to permit punishment for injuring a nonparty victim would add a near standardless dimension to the punitive damages equation. How many such victims are there? How seriously were they injured? Under what circumstances did injury occur? The trial will not likely answer such questions as to nonparty victims. The jury will be left to speculate. And the fundamental due process concerns to which our punitive damages cases refer\u0097risks of arbitrariness, uncertainty and lack of notice\u0097will be magnified. <i>State Farm,</i> 538 U.S., at 416, 418, 123 S.Ct. 1513; <i>BMW,</i> 517 U.S., at 574, 116 S.Ct. 1589.</p>\n<p>Finally, we can find no authority supporting the use of punitive damages awards for the purpose of punishing a defendant for harming others. We have said that it may be appropriate to consider the reasonableness of a punitive damages award in light of the <i>potential</i> harm the defendant's conduct could have caused. But we have made clear that the potential harm at issue was harm potentially caused <i>the plaintiff.</i> See <i>State Farm, supra,</i> at 424, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (\"[W]e have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, <i>to the plaintiff</i> and the punitive damages award\" (emphasis added)). See also <i>TXO,</i> 509 U.S., at 460-462, 113 S.Ct. 2711 (plurality opinion) (using same kind of comparison as basis for finding a punitive award not unconstitutionally excessive). We did use the term \"error-free\" (in <i>BMW</i>) to describe a lower court punitive damages calculation that likely included harm to others in the equation. 517 U.S., at 568, n. 11, 116 S.Ct. 1589. But context makes clear that the term \"error-free\" in the <i>BMW</i> footnote referred to errors relevant to the case at hand. Although elsewhere in <i>BMW</i> we noted that there was no suggestion that the plaintiff \"or any other BMW purchaser was threatened with any additional potential harm\" by the defendant's conduct, we did not purport to decide the question of harm to others. <i>Id.,</i> at 582, 116 S.Ct. 1589. Rather, the opinion appears to have left the question open.</p>\n<p>Respondent argues that she is free to show harm to other victims because it is relevant to a different part of the punitive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1064</span> damages constitutional equation, namely, reprehensibility. That is to say, harm to others shows more reprehensible conduct. Philip Morris, in turn, does not deny that a plaintiff may show harm to others in order to demonstrate reprehensibility. Nor do we. Evidence of actual harm to nonparties can help to show that the conduct that harmed the plaintiff also posed a substantial risk of harm to the general public, and so was particularly reprehensible\u0097although counsel may argue in a particular case that conduct resulting in no harm to others nonetheless posed a grave risk to the public, or the converse. Yet for the reasons given above, a jury may not go further than this and use a punitive damages verdict to punish a defendant directly on account of harms it is alleged to have visited on nonparties.</p>\n<p>Given the risks of unfairness that we have mentioned, it is constitutionally important for a court to provide assurance that the jury will ask the right question, not the wrong one. And given the risks of arbitrariness, the concern for adequate notice, and the risk that punitive damages awards can, in practice, impose one State's (or one jury's) policies (<i>e.g.,</i> banning cigarettes) upon other States\u0097all of which accompany awards that, today, may be many times the size of such awards in the 18th and 19th centuries, see <i>id.,</i> at 594-595, 116 S.Ct. 1589 (BREYER, J., concurring)\u0097it is particularly important that States avoid procedure that unnecessarily deprives juries of proper legal guidance. We therefore conclude that the Due Process Clause requires States to provide assurance that juries are not asking the wrong question, <i>i.e.,</i> seeking, not simply to determine reprehensibility, but also to punish for harm caused strangers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Respondent suggests as well that the Oregon Supreme Court, in essence, agreed with us, that it did not authorize punitive damages awards based upon punishment for harm caused to nonparties. We concede that one might read some portions of the Oregon Supreme Court's opinion as focusing only upon reprehensibility. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 340 Ore., at 51, 127 P.3d, at 1175 (\"[T]he jury could consider whether Williams and his misfortune were merely exemplars of the harm that Philip Morris was prepared to inflict on the smoking public at large\"). But the Oregon court's opinion elsewhere makes clear that that court held more than these few phrases might suggest.</p>\n<p>The instruction that Philip Morris said the trial court should have given distinguishes between using harm to others as part of the \"reasonable relationship\" equation (which it would allow) and using it directly as a basis for punishment. The instruction asked the trial court to tell the jury that \"you <i>may</i> consider the extent of harm suffered by others <i>in determining what [the] reasonable relationship is</i>\" between Philip Morris' punishable misconduct and harm caused to Jesse Williams, \"<i>[but] you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons, who may bring lawsuits of their own</i> in which other juries can resolve their claims ....\" App. 280a (emphasis added). And as the Oregon Supreme Court explicitly recognized, Philip Morris argued that the Constitution \"prohibits the state, acting through a civil jury, from using punitive damages to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties.\" 340 Ore., at 51-52, 127 P.3d, at 1175.</p>\n<p>The court rejected that claim. In doing so, it pointed out (1) that this Court in <i>State Farm</i> had held only that a jury could not base its award upon \"dissimilar\" acts of a defendant. 340 Ore., at 52-53, 127 P.3d, at 1175-1176. It added (2) that \"[i]f <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1065</span> a jury cannot punish for the conduct, then it is difficult to see why it may consider it at all.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 52, n. 3, 127 P.3d, at 1175, n. 3. And it stated (3) that \"[i]t is unclear to us how a jury could `consider' harm to others, yet withhold that consideration from the punishment calculus.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Oregon court's first statement is correct. We did not previously hold explicitly that a jury may not punish for the harm caused others. But we do so hold now. We do not agree with the Oregon court's second statement. We have explained why we believe the Due Process Clause prohibits a State's inflicting punishment for harm caused strangers to the litigation. At the same time we recognize that conduct that risks harm to many is likely more reprehensible than conduct that risks harm to only a few. And a jury consequently may take this fact into account in determining reprehensibility. Cf., <i>e.g., </i><i>Witte v. United States,</i> 515 U.S. 389, 400, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (recidivism statutes taking into account a criminal defendant's other misconduct do not impose an \"`additional penalty for the earlier crimes,' but instead ... `a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one'\" (quoting <i>Gryger v. Burke,</i> 334 U.S. 728, 732, 68 S.Ct. 1256, 92 L.Ed. 1683 (1948))).</p>\n<p>The Oregon court's third statement raises a practical problem. How can we know whether a jury, in taking account of harm caused others under the rubric of reprehensibility, also seeks to <i>punish</i> the defendant for having caused injury to others? Our answer is that state courts cannot authorize procedures that create an unreasonable and unnecessary risk of any such confusion occurring. In particular, we believe that where the risk of that misunderstanding is a significant one\u0097because, for instance, of the sort of evidence that was introduced at trial or the kinds of argument the plaintiff made to the jury\u0097a court, upon request, must protect against that risk. Although the States have some flexibility to determine what <i>kind</i> of procedures they will implement, federal constitutional law obligates them to provide <i>some</i> form of protection in appropriate cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>As the preceding discussion makes clear, we believe that the Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong constitutional standard when considering Philip Morris' appeal. We remand this case so that the Oregon Supreme Court can apply the standard we have set forth. Because the application of this standard may lead to the need for a new trial, or a change in the level of the punitive damages award, we shall not consider whether the award is constitutionally \"grossly excessive.\" We vacate the Oregon Supreme Court's judgment and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes both substantive and procedural constraints on the power of the States to impose punitive damages on tortfeasors. See <i>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell,</i> 538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003); <i>Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc.,</i> 532 U.S. 424, 121 S.Ct. 1678, 149 L.Ed.2d 674 (2001); <i>BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore,</i> 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996); <i>Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg,</i> 512 U.S. 415, 114 S.Ct. 2331, 129 L.Ed.2d 336 (1994); <i>TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp.,</i> 509 U.S. 443, 113 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1066</span> 2711, 125 L.Ed.2d 366 (1993). I remain firmly convinced that the cases announcing those constraints were correctly decided. In my view the Oregon Supreme Court faithfully applied the reasoning in those opinions to the egregious facts disclosed by this record. I agree with Justice GINSBURG's explanation of why no procedural error even arguably justifying reversal occurred at the trial in this case. See <i>post,</i> p. 1068-1069.</p>\n<p>Of greater importance to me, however, is the Court's imposition of a novel limit on the State's power to impose punishment in civil litigation. Unlike the Court, I see no reason why an interest in punishing a wrongdoer \"for harming persons who are not before the court,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1060, should not be taken into consideration when assessing the appropriate sanction for reprehensible conduct.</p>\n<p>Whereas compensatory damages are measured by the harm the defendant has caused the plaintiff, punitive damages are a sanction for the public harm the defendant's conduct has caused or threatened. There is little difference between the justification for a criminal sanction, such as a fine or a term of imprisonment, and an award of punitive damages. See <i>Cooper Industries,</i> 532 U.S., at 432, 121 S.Ct. 1678. In our early history either type of sanction might have been imposed in litigation prosecuted by a private citizen. See <i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 127-128, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). And while in neither context would the sanction typically include a pecuniary award measured by the harm that the conduct had caused to any third parties, in both contexts the harm to third parties would surely be a relevant factor to consider in evaluating the reprehensibility of the defendant's wrongdoing. We have never held otherwise.</p>\n<p>In the case before us, evidence attesting to the possible harm the defendant's extensive deceitful conduct caused other Oregonians was properly presented to the jury. No evidence was offered to establish an appropriate measure of damages to compensate such third parties for their injuries, and no one argued that the punitive damages award would serve any such purpose. To award compensatory damages to remedy such third-party harm might well constitute a taking of property from the defendant without due process, see <i>ante,</i> at 1060. But a punitive damages award, instead of serving a compensatory purpose, serves the entirely different purposes of retribution and deterrence that underlie every criminal sanction. <i>State Farm,</i> 538 U.S., at 416, 123 S.Ct. 1513. This justification for punitive damages has even greater salience when, as in this case, see Ore.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 31.735(1) (2003), the award is payable in whole or in part to the State rather than to the private litigant.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>While apparently recognizing the novelty of its holding, <i>ante,</i> at 1065, the majority relies on a distinction between taking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1067</span> third-party harm into account in order to assess the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct\u0097which is permitted\u0097from doing so in order to punish the defendant \"directly\"\u0097which is forbidden. <i>Ante,</i> at 1064. This nuance eludes me. When a jury increases a punitive damages award because injuries to third parties enhanced the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, the jury is by definition punishing the defendant\u0097directly\u0097for third-party harm.<sup>[2]</sup> A murderer who kills his victim by throwing a bomb that injures dozens of bystanders should be punished more severely than one who harms no one other than his intended victim. Similarly, there is no reason why the measure of the appropriate punishment for engaging in a campaign of deceit in distributing a poisonous and addictive substance to thousands of cigarette smokers statewide should not include consideration of the harm to those \"bystanders\" as well as the harm to the individual plaintiff. The Court endorses a contrary conclusion without providing us with any reasoned justification.</p>\n<p>It is far too late in the day to argue that the Due Process Clause merely guarantees fair procedure and imposes no substantive limits on a State's lawmaking power. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Moore v. East Cleveland,</i> 431 U.S. 494, 544, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (White, J., dissenting); <i>Poe v. Ullman,</i> 367 U.S. 497, 540-541, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting); <i>Whitney v. California,</i> 274 U.S. 357, 373, 47 S.Ct. 641, 71 L.Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). It remains true, however, that the Court should be \"reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended.\" <i>Collins v. Harker Heights,</i> 503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992).

I write separately to reiterate my view that \"`the Constitution does not constrain the size of punitive damages awards.'\" <i>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell,</i> 538 U.S. 408, 429-430, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting <i>Cooper Industries, Inc. v.

It matters not that the Court styles today's holding as \"procedural\" because the \"procedural\" rule is simply a confusing implementation of the substantive due process regime this Court has created for punitive damages. See <i>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip,</i> 499 U.S. 1, 26-27, 111 S.Ct. 1032, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (\"In 1868 ... punitive damages were undoubtedly an established part of the American common law of torts. It is ... clear that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1068</span> no particular procedures were deemed necessary to circumscribe a jury's discretion regarding the award of such damages, or their amount\"). Today's opinion proves once again that this Court's punitive damages jurisprudence is \"insusceptible of principled application.\" <i>BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore,</i> 517 U.S. 559, 599, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996) (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice SCALIA and Justice THOMAS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The purpose of punitive damages, it can hardly be denied, is not to compensate, but to punish. Punish for what? Not for harm actually caused \"strangers to the litigation,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1063, the Court states, but for the <i>reprehensibility</i> of defendant's conduct, <i>ante,</i> at 1063-1064. \"[C]onduct that risks harm to many,\" the Court observes, \"is likely more reprehensible than conduct that risks harm to only a few.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1065. The Court thus conveys that, when punitive damages are at issue, a jury is properly instructed to consider the extent of harm suffered by others as a measure of reprehensibility, but not to mete out punishment for injuries in fact sustained by nonparties. <i>Ante,</i> at 1063-1065. The Oregon courts did not rule otherwise. They have endeavored to follow our decisions, most recently in <i>BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore,</i> 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996), and <i>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell,</i> 538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003), and have \"deprive[d] [no jury] of proper legal guidance,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1064. Vacation of the Oregon Supreme Court's judgment, I am convinced, is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>The right question regarding reprehensibility, the Court acknowledges, <i>ante,</i> at ____8, would train on \"the harm that Philip Morris was prepared to inflict on the smoking public at large.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting 340 Or. 35, 51, 127 P.3d 1165, 1175 (2006)). See also 340 Ore., at 55, 127 P.3d, at 1177 (\"[T]he jury, <i>in assessing the reprehensibility of Philip Morris's actions,</i> could consider evidence of similar harm to other Oregonians caused (or threatened) by the same conduct.\" (emphasis added)). The Court identifies no evidence introduced and no charge delivered inconsistent with that inquiry.</p>\n<p>The Court's order vacating the Oregon Supreme Court's judgment is all the more inexplicable considering that Philip Morris did not preserve any objection to the charges in fact delivered to the jury, to the evidence introduced at trial, or to opposing counsel's argument. The sole objection Philip Morris preserved was to the trial court's refusal to give defendant's requested charge number 34. See <i>id.,</i> at 54, 127 P.3d, at 1176. The proposed instruction read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"If you determine that some amount of punitive damages should be imposed on the defendant, it will then be your task to set an amount that is appropriate. This should be such amount as you believe is necessary to achieve the objectives of deterrence and punishment. While there is no set formula to be applied in reaching an appropriate amount, I will now advise you of some of the factors that you may wish to consider in this connection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) The size of any punishment should bear a reasonable relationship to the harm caused to Jesse Williams by the defendant's punishable misconduct. Although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what that reasonable relationship is, you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1069</span> persons, who may bring lawsuits of their own in which other juries can resolve their claims and award punitive damages for those harms, as such other juries see fit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) The size of the punishment may appropriately reflect the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct\u0097that is, how far the defendant has departed from accepted societal norms of conduct.\" App. 280a.</blockquote>\n<p>Under that charge, just what use could the jury properly make of \"the extent of harm suffered by others\"? The answer slips from my grasp. A judge seeking to enlighten rather than confuse surely would resist delivering the requested charge.</p>\n<p>The Court ventures no opinion on the propriety of the charge proposed by Philip Morris, though Philip Morris preserved no other objection to the trial proceedings. Rather than addressing the one objection Philip Morris properly preserved, the Court reaches outside the bounds of the case as postured when the trial court entered its judgment. I would accord more respectful treatment to the proceedings and dispositions of state courts that sought diligently to adhere to our changing, less than crystalline precedent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, and in light of the abundant evidence of \"the potential harm [Philip Morris'] conduct could have caused,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1063 (emphasis deleted), I would affirm the decision of the Oregon Supreme Court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Court's holding in <i>Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc.,</i> 492 U.S. 257, 109 S.Ct. 2909, 106 L.Ed.2d 219 (1989), distinguished, for the purposes of appellate review under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, between criminal sanctions and civil fines awarded entirely to the plaintiff. The fact that part of the award in this case is payable to the State lends further support to my conclusion that it should be treated as the functional equivalent of a criminal sanction. See <i>id.,</i> at 263-264, 109 S.Ct. 2909. I continue to agree with Justice O'Connor and those scholars who have concluded that the Excessive Fines Clause is applicable to punitive damages awards regardless of who receives the ultimate payout. See <i>id.,</i> at 286-299, 109 S.Ct. 2909 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>[2]  It is no answer to refer, as the majority does, to recidivism statutes. <i>Ante,</i> at 1065. In that context, we have distinguished between taking prior crimes into account as an aggravating factor in penalizing the conduct before the court versus doing so to punish for the earlier crimes. <i>Ibid.</i> But if enhancing a penalty for a present crime because of prior conduct that has already been punished is permissible, it is certainly proper to enhance a penalty because the conduct before the court, which has never been punished, injured multiple victims.</p>\n\n</div>",

WILLIAMS, PERSONAL REPRE\n   SENTATIVE OF ESTATE OF WILLIAMS, DECEASED \n\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OREGON\n\n No. 05\u20131256. Argued October 31, 2006\u2014Decided February 20, 2007\nIn this state negligence and deceit lawsuit, a jury found that Jesse Wil\n  liams\u2019 death was caused by smoking and that petitioner Philip Mor\n  ris, which manufactured the cigarettes he favored, knowingly and\n  falsely led him to believe that smoking was safe. In respect to deceit,\n  it awarded $821,000 in compensatory damages and $79.5 million in\n  punitive damages to respondent, the personal representative of Wil\n  liams\u2019 estate. The trial court reduced the latter award, but it was re\n  stored by the Oregon Court of Appeals. The State Supreme Court re\n  jected Philip Morris\u2019 arguments that the trial court should have\n  instructed the jury that it could not punish Philip Morris for injury to\n  persons not before the court, and that the roughly 100-to-1 ratio the\n  $79.5 million award bore to the compensatory damages amount indi\n  cated a \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d punitive award.\n  Held:\n    1. A punitive damages award based in part on a jury\u2019s desire to\n  punish a defendant for harming nonparties amounts to a taking of\n  property from the defendant without due process. Pp. 4\u201310.\n       (a) While \u201c[p]unitive damages may properly be imposed to fur\n  ther a State\u2019s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and\n  deterring its repetition,\u201d BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517\n  U. S. 559, 568, unless a State insists upon proper standards to cabin\n  the jury\u2019s discretionary authority, its punitive damages system may\n  deprive a defendant of \u201cfair notice . . . of the severity of the penalty\n  that a State may impose,\u201d id., at 574; may threaten \u201carbitrary pun\n  ishments,\u201d State Farm Mut.

Thus,\n2                  PHILIP MORRIS USA v. WILLIAMS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the Constitution imposes limits on both the procedures for awarding\n    punitive damages and amounts forbidden as \u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d See\n    Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U. S. 415, 432. The Constitution\u2019s\n    procedural limitations are considered here. Pp. 4\u20135.\n         (b) The Due Process Clause forbids a State to use a punitive\n    damages award to punish a defendant for injury inflicted on strang\n    ers to the litigation. For one thing, a defendant threatened with pun\n    ishment for such injury has no opportunity to defend against the\n    charge. See Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U. S. 56, 66. For another, per\n    mitting such punishment would add a near standardless dimension\n    to the punitive damages equation and magnify the fundamental due\n    process concerns of this Court\u2019s pertinent cases\u2014arbitrariness, un\n    certainty, and lack of notice. Finally, the Court finds no authority to\n    support using punitive damages awards to punish a defendant for\n    harming others. BMW, supra, at 568, n.11, distinguished. Respon\n    dent argues that showing harm to others is relevant to a different\n    part of the punitive damages constitutional equation, namely, repre\n    hensibility. While evidence of actual harm to nonparties can help to\n    show that the conduct that harmed the plaintiff also posed a substan\n    tial risk to the general public, and so was particularly reprehensible,\n    a jury may not go further and use a punitive damages verdict to pun\n    ish a defendant directly for harms to those nonparties. Given the\n    risks of unfairness, it is constitutionally important for a court to pro\n    vide assurance that a jury is asking the right question; and given the\n    risks of arbitrariness, inadequate notice, and imposing one State\u2019s po\n    licies on other States, it is particularly important that States avoid\n    procedure that unnecessarily deprives juries of proper legal guidance.\n    Pp. 5\u20138.\n         (c) The Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s opinion focused on more than\n    reprehensibility. In rejecting Philip Morris\u2019 claim that the Constitu\n    tion prohibits using punitive damages to punish a defendant for\n    harm to nonparties, it made three statements. The first\u2014that this\n    Court held in State Farm only that a jury could not base an award on\n    dissimilar acts of a defendant\u2014was correct, but this Court now ex\n    plicitly holds that a jury may not punish for harm to others. This\n    Court disagrees with the second statement\u2014that if a jury cannot\n    punish for the conduct, there is no reason to consider it\u2014since the\n    Due Process Clause prohibits a State\u2019s inflicting punishment for\n    harm to nonparties, but permits a jury to consider such harm in de\n    termining reprehensibility. The third statement\u2014that it is unclear\n    how a jury could consider harm to nonparties and then withhold that\n    consideration from the punishment calculus\u2014raises the practical\n    problem of how to know whether a jury punished the defendant for\n    causing injury to others rather than just took such injury into ac\n                     Cite as: 549 U.

The answer is that state\n  courts cannot authorize procedures that create an unreasonable and\n  unnecessary risk of any such confusion occurring. Although States\n  have some flexibility in determining what kind of procedures to im\n  plement to protect against that risk, federal constitutional law obli\n  gates them to provide some form of protection where the risk of mis\n  understanding is a significant one. Pp. 8\u201310.\n     2. Because the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s application of the correct\n  standard may lead to a new trial, or a change in the level of the puni\n  tive damages award, this Court will not consider the question\n  whether the award is constitutionally \u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d P. 10.\n340 Ore. 35, 127 P. 3d 1165, vacated and remanded.\n\n  BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

We are asked whether the\nConstitution\u2019s Due Process Clause permits a jury to base\nthat award in part upon its desire to punish the defendant\nfor harming persons who are not before the court (e.g.,\nvictims whom the parties do not represent). We hold that\nsuch an award would amount to a taking of \u201cproperty\u201d\nfrom the defendant without due process.\n                               I\n   This lawsuit arises out of the death of Jesse Williams, a\nheavy cigarette smoker. Respondent, Williams\u2019 widow,\nrepresents his estate in this state lawsuit for negligence\nand deceit against Philip Morris, the manufacturer of\nMarlboro, the brand that Williams favored. A jury found\nthat Williams\u2019 death was caused by smoking; that Wil\nliams smoked in significant part because he thought it was\nsafe to do so; and that Philip Morris knowingly and falsely\nled him to believe that this was so. The jury ultimately\n2             PHILIP MORRIS USA v. WILLIAMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfound that Philip Morris was negligent (as was Williams)\nand that Philip Morris had engaged in deceit. In respect\nto deceit, the claim at issue here, it awarded compensatory\ndamages of about $821,000 (about $21,000 economic and\n$800,000 noneconomic) along with $79.5 million in puni\ntive damages.\n   The trial judge subsequently found the $79.5 million\npunitive damages award \u201cexcessive,\u201d see, e.g., BMW of\nNorth America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559 (1996), and\nreduced it to $32 million. Both sides appealed. The Ore\ngon Court of Appeals rejected Philip Morris\u2019 arguments\nand restored the $79.5 million jury award. Subsequently,\nPhilip Morris sought review in the Oregon Supreme Court\n(which denied review) and then here. We remanded the\ncase in light of State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v.\nCampbell, 538 U. S. 408 (2003). 540 U. S. 801 (2003). The\nOregon Court of Appeals adhered to its original views.\nAnd Philip Morris sought, and this time obtained, review\nin the Oregon Supreme Court.\n   Philip Morris then made two arguments relevant here.\nFirst, it said that the trial court should have accepted, but\ndid not accept, a proposed \u201cpunitive damages\u201d instruction\nthat specified the jury could not seek to punish Philip\nMorris for injury to other persons not before the court. In\nparticular, Philip Morris pointed out that the plaintiff\u2019s\nattorney had told the jury to \u201cthink about how many other\nJesse Williams in the last 40 years in the State of Oregon\nthere have been. . . . In Oregon, how many people do we\nsee outside, driving home . . . smoking cigarettes? . . .\n[C]igarettes . . . are going to kill ten [of every hundred].\n[And] the market share of Marlboros [i.e., Philip Morris] is\none-third [i.e., one of every three killed].\u201d App. 197a, 199a.\nIn light of this argument, Philip Morris asked the trial\ncourt to tell the jury that \u201cyou may consider the extent of\nharm suffered by others in determining what [the] reason\nable relationship is\u201d between any punitive award and \u201cthe\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nharm caused to Jesse Williams\u201d by Philip Morris\u2019 miscon\nduct, \u201c[but] you are not to punish the defendant for the\nimpact of its alleged misconduct on other persons, who\nmay bring lawsuits of their own in which other juries can\nresolve their claims . . . .\u201d Id., at 280a. The judge rejected\nthis proposal and instead told the jury that \u201c[p]unitive\ndamages are awarded against a defendant to punish mis\nconduct and to deter misconduct,\u201d and \u201care not intended to\ncompensate the plaintiff or anyone else for damages\ncaused by the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d Id., at 283a. In Philip\nMorris\u2019 view, the result was a significant likelihood that a\nportion of the $79.5 million award represented punish\nment for its having harmed others, a punishment that the\nDue Process Clause would here forbid.\n   Second, Philip Morris pointed to the roughly 100-to-1\nratio the $79.5 million punitive damages award bears to\n$821,000 in compensatory damages. Philip Morris noted\nthat this Court in BMW emphasized the constitutional\nneed for punitive damages awards to reflect (1) the \u201crep\nrehensibility\u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct, (2) a \u201creasonable\nrelationship\u201d to the harm the plaintiff (or related victim)\nsuffered, and (3) the presence (or absence) of \u201csanctions,\u201d\ne.g., criminal penalties, that state law provided for compa\nrable conduct, 517 U. S., at 575\u2013585. And in State Farm,\nthis Court said that the longstanding historical practice of\nsetting punitive damages at two, three, or four times the\nsize of compensatory damages, while \u201cnot binding,\u201d is\n\u201cinstructive,\u201d and that \u201c[s]ingle-digit multipliers are more\nlikely to comport with due process.\u201d 538 U. S., at 425.\nPhilip Morris claimed that, in light of this case law, the\npunitive award was \u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d See TXO Produc\ntion Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 458\n(1993) (plurality opinion); BMW, supra, at 574\u2013575; State\nFarm, supra, at 416\u2013417.\n   The Oregon Supreme Court rejected these and other\nPhilip Morris arguments. In particular, it rejected Philip\n4             PHILIP MORRIS USA v. WILLIAMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMorris\u2019 claim that the Constitution prohibits a state jury\n\u201cfrom using punitive damages to punish a defendant for\nharm to nonparties.\u201d 340 Ore. 35, 51\u201352, 127 P. 3d 1165,\n1175 (2006). And in light of Philip Morris\u2019 reprehensible\nconduct, it found that the $79.5 million award was not\n\u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d Id., at 63\u201364, 127 P. 3d, at 1181\u20131182.\n   Philip Morris then sought certiorari. It asked us to\nconsider, among other things, (1) its claim that Oregon\nhad unconstitutionally permitted it to be punished for\nharming nonparty victims; and (2) whether Oregon had in\neffect disregarded \u201cthe constitutional requirement that\npunitive damages be reasonably related to the plaintiff\u2019s\nharm.\u201d Pet. for Cert. (I). We granted certiorari limited to\nthese two questions.\n   For reasons we shall set forth, we consider only the first\nof these questions. We vacate the Oregon Supreme\nCourt\u2019s judgment, and we remand the case for further\nproceedings.\n                              II\n   This Court has long made clear that \u201c[p]unitive dam\nages may properly be imposed to further a State\u2019s legiti\nmate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deter\nring its repetition.\u201d BMW, supra, at 568.

S. 415, 432 (1994) (requiring judicial review\nof the size of punitive awards); Cooper Industries, Inc. v.\nLeatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.

Be\ncause we shall not decide whether the award here at issue\nis \u201cgrossly excessive,\u201d we need now only consider the\nConstitution\u2019s procedural limitations.\n                             III\n   In our view, the Constitution\u2019s Due Process Clause\nforbids a State to use a punitive damages award to punish\na defendant for injury that it inflicts upon nonparties or\nthose whom they directly represent, i.e., injury that it\ninflicts upon those who are, essentially, strangers to the\nlitigation. For one thing, the Due Process Clause prohibits\na State from punishing an individual without first provid\ning that individual with \u201can opportunity to present every\navailable defense.\u201d Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U. S. 56, 66\n(1972) (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet a defen\n6             PHILIP MORRIS USA v. WILLIAMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndant threatened with punishment for injuring a nonparty\nvictim has no opportunity to defend against the charge, by\nshowing, for example in a case such as this, that the other\nvictim was not entitled to damages because he or she\nknew that smoking was dangerous or did not rely upon the\ndefendant\u2019s statements to the contrary.\n   For another, to permit punishment for injuring a non\nparty victim would add a near standardless dimension to\nthe punitive damages equation. How many such victims\nare there? How seriously were they injured? Under what\ncircumstances did injury occur? The trial will not likely\nanswer such questions as to nonparty victims. The jury\nwill be left to speculate. And the fundamental due process\nconcerns to which our punitive damages cases refer\u2014risks\nof arbitrariness, uncertainty and lack of notice\u2014will be\nmagnified. State Farm, 538 U. S., at 416, 418; BMW, 517\nU. S., at 574.\n   Finally, we can find no authority supporting the use of\npunitive damages awards for the purpose of punishing a\ndefendant for harming others. We have said that it may\nbe appropriate to consider the reasonableness of a punitive\ndamages award in light of the potential harm the defen\ndant\u2019s conduct could have caused. But we have made clear\nthat the potential harm at issue was harm potentially\ncaused the plaintiff. See State Farm, supra, at 424 (\u201c[W]e\nhave been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional\nlimits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the\nplaintiff and the punitive damages award\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). See also TXO, 509 U. S., at 460\u2013462 (plurality\nopinion) (using same kind of comparison as basis for find\ning a punitive award not unconstitutionally excessive).\nWe did use the term \u201cerror-free\u201d (in BMW) to describe a\nlower court punitive damages calculation that likely in\ncluded harm to others in the equation. 517 U. S., at 568,\nn. 11. But context makes clear that the term \u201cerror-free\u201d\nin the BMW footnote referred to errors relevant to the case\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat hand. Although elsewhere in BMW we noted that there\nwas no suggestion that the plaintiff \u201cor any other BMW\npurchaser was threatened with any additional potential\nharm\u201d by the defendant\u2019s conduct, we did not purport to\ndecide the question of harm to others. Id., at 582. Rather,\nthe opinion appears to have left the question open.\n   Respondent argues that she is free to show harm to\nother victims because it is relevant to a different part of\nthe punitive damages constitutional equation, namely,\nreprehensibility. That is to say, harm to others shows\nmore reprehensible conduct. Philip Morris, in turn, does\nnot deny that a plaintiff may show harm to others in order\nto demonstrate reprehensibility. Nor do we. Evidence of\nactual harm to nonparties can help to show that the con\nduct that harmed the plaintiff also posed a substantial\nrisk of harm to the general public, and so was particularly\nreprehensible\u2014although counsel may argue in a particu\nlar case that conduct resulting in no harm to others none\ntheless posed a grave risk to the public, or the converse.\nYet for the reasons given above, a jury may not go further\nthan this and use a punitive damages verdict to punish a\ndefendant directly on account of harms it is alleged to\nhave visited on nonparties.\n   Given the risks of unfairness that we have mentioned, it\nis constitutionally important for a court to provide assur\nance that the jury will ask the right question, not the\nwrong one. And given the risks of arbitrariness, the con\ncern for adequate notice, and the risk that punitive dam\nages awards can, in practice, impose one State\u2019s (or one\njury\u2019s) policies (e.g., banning cigarettes) upon other\nStates\u2014all of which accompany awards that, today, may\nbe many times the size of such awards in the 18th and\n19th centuries, see id., at 594\u2013595 (BREYER, J., concur\nring)\u2014it is particularly important that States avoid proce\ndure that unnecessarily deprives juries of proper legal\nguidance. We therefore conclude that the Due Process\n8             PHILIP MORRIS USA v. WILLIAMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nClause requires States to provide assurance that juries are\nnot asking the wrong question, i.e., seeking, not simply to\ndetermine reprehensibility, but also to punish for harm\ncaused strangers.\n                             IV\n   Respondent suggests as well that the Oregon Supreme\nCourt, in essence, agreed with us, that it did not authorize\npunitive damages awards based upon punishment for\nharm caused to nonparties. We concede that one might\nread some portions of the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s opinion\nas focusing only upon reprehensibility. See, e.g., 340 Ore.,\nat 51, 127 P. 3d, at 1175 (\u201c[T]he jury could consider\nwhether Williams and his misfortune were merely exem\nplars of the harm that Philip Morris was prepared to\ninflict on the smoking public at large\u201d). But the Oregon\ncourt\u2019s opinion elsewhere makes clear that that court held\nmore than these few phrases might suggest.\n   The instruction that Philip Morris said the trial court\nshould have given distinguishes between using harm to\nothers as part of the \u201creasonable relationship\u201d equation\n(which it would allow) and using it directly as a basis for\npunishment. The instruction asked the trial court to tell\nthe jury that \u201cyou may consider the extent of harm suf\nfered by others in determining what [the] reasonable rela\ntionship is\u201d between Philip Morris\u2019 punishable misconduct\nand harm caused to Jesse Williams, \u201c[but] you are not to\npunish the defendant for the impact of its alleged miscon\nduct on other persons, who may bring lawsuits of their own\nin which other juries can resolve their claims . . . .\u201d App.\n280a (emphasis added). And as the Oregon Supreme\nCourt explicitly recognized, Philip Morris argued that the\nConstitution \u201cprohibits the state, acting through a civil\njury, from using punitive damages to punish a defendant\nfor harm to nonparties.\u201d 340 Ore., at 51\u201352, 127 P. 3d, at\n1175.\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The court rejected that claim. In doing so, it pointed out\n(1) that this Court in State Farm had held only that a jury\ncould not base its award upon \u201cdissimilar\u201d acts of a defen\ndant. 340 Ore., at 52\u201353, 127 P. 3d, at 1175\u20131176. It\nadded (2) that \u201c[i]f a jury cannot punish for the conduct,\nthen it is difficult to see why it may consider it at all.\u201d Id.,\nat 52, n. 3, 127 P. 3d, at 1175, n. 3. And it stated (3) that\n\u201c[i]t is unclear to us how a jury could \u2018consider\u2019 harm to\nothers, yet withhold that consideration from the punish\nment calculus.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Oregon court\u2019s first statement is correct. We did\nnot previously hold explicitly that a jury may not punish\nfor the harm caused others. But we do so hold now. We\ndo not agree with the Oregon court\u2019s second statement.\nWe have explained why we believe the Due Process Clause\nprohibits a State\u2019s inflicting punishment for harm caused\nstrangers to the litigation. At the same time we recognize\nthat conduct that risks harm to many is likely more rep\nrehensible than conduct that risks harm to only a few.\nAnd a jury consequently may take this fact into account in\ndetermining reprehensibility. Cf., e.g., Witte v. United\nStates, 515 U. S. 389, 400 (1995) (recidivism statutes\ntaking into account a criminal defendant\u2019s other miscon\nduct do not impose an \u201c \u2018additional penalty for the earlier\ncrimes,\u2019 but instead . . . \u2018a stiffened penalty for the latest\ncrime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense\nbecause a repetitive one\u2019 \u201d (quoting Gryger v. Burke, 334\nU. S. 728, 732 (1948))).\n   The Oregon court\u2019s third statement raises a practical\nproblem. How can we know whether a jury, in taking\naccount of harm caused others under the rubric of repre\nhensibility, also seeks to punish the defendant for having\ncaused injury to others? Our answer is that state courts\ncannot authorize procedures that create an unreasonable\nand unnecessary risk of any such confusion occurring. In\nparticular, we believe that where the risk of that misun\n10            PHILIP MORRIS USA v. WILLIAMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nderstanding is a significant one\u2014because, for instance, of\nthe sort of evidence that was introduced at trial or the\nkinds of argument the plaintiff made to the jury\u2014a court,\nupon request, must protect against that risk. Although\nthe States have some flexibility to determine what kind of\nprocedures they will implement, federal constitutional law\nobligates them to provide some form of protection in ap\npropriate cases.\n                             V\n   As the preceding discussion makes clear, we believe that\nthe Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong constitu\ntional standard when considering Philip Morris\u2019 appeal.\nWe remand this case so that the Oregon Supreme Court\ncan apply the standard we have set forth. Because the\napplication of this standard may lead to the need for a new\ntrial, or a change in the level of the punitive damages\naward, we shall not consider whether the award is consti\ntutionally \u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d We vacate the Oregon\nSupreme Court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for fur\nther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 549 U.

See State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v.\nCampbell, 538 U. S. 408 (2003); Cooper Industries, Inc. v.\nLeatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U. S. 424 (2001); BMW\nof North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.

I remain firmly convinced that the cases\nannouncing those constraints were correctly decided. In\nmy view the Oregon Supreme Court faithfully applied the\nreasoning in those opinions to the egregious facts disclosed\nby this record. I agree with JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s explana\ntion of why no procedural error even arguably justifying\nreversal occurred at the trial in this case. See post, p. ___.\n   Of greater importance to me, however, is the Court\u2019s\nimposition of a novel limit on the State\u2019s power to impose\npunishment in civil litigation. Unlike the Court, I see no\nreason why an interest in punishing a wrongdoer \u201cfor\nharming persons who are not before the court,\u201d ante, at 1,\nshould not be taken into consideration when assessing the\n2             PHILIP MORRIS USA v. WILLIAMS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nappropriate sanction for reprehensible conduct.\n   Whereas compensatory damages are measured by the\nharm the defendant has caused the plaintiff, punitive\ndamages are a sanction for the public harm the defen\ndant\u2019s conduct has caused or threatened. There is little\ndifference between the justification for a criminal sanc\ntion, such as a fine or a term of imprisonment, and an\naward of punitive damages. See Cooper Industries, 532\nU. S., at 432. In our early history either type of sanction\nmight have been imposed in litigation prosecuted by a\nprivate citizen. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Envi\nronment, 523 U. S. 83, 127\u2013128 (1998) (STEVENS, J., con\ncurring in judgment). And while in neither context would\nthe sanction typically include a pecuniary award meas\nured by the harm that the conduct had caused to any third\nparties, in both contexts the harm to third parties would\nsurely be a relevant factor to consider in evaluating the\nreprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing. We have\nnever held otherwise.\n   In the case before us, evidence attesting to the possible\nharm the defendant\u2019s extensive deceitful conduct caused\nother Oregonians was properly presented to the jury. No\nevidence was offered to establish an appropriate measure\nof damages to compensate such third parties for their\ninjuries, and no one argued that the punitive damages\naward would serve any such purpose. To award compen\nsatory damages to remedy such third-party harm might\nwell constitute a taking of property from the defendant\nwithout due process, see ante, at 1. But a punitive dam\nages award, instead of serving a compensatory purpose,\nserves the entirely different purposes of retribution and\ndeterrence that underlie every criminal sanction. State\nFarm, 538 U. S., at 416. This justification for punitive\ndamages has even greater salience when, as in this case,\nsee Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a731.735(1) (2003), the award is payable\nin whole or in part to the State rather than to the private\n                      Cite as: 549 U.

Ante, at 7. This nuance\neludes me. When a jury increases a punitive damages\naward because injuries to third parties enhanced the\nreprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the jury is by\ndefinition punishing the defendant\u2014directly\u2014for third-\nparty harm.2 A murderer who kills his victim by throwing\na bomb that injures dozens of bystanders should be pun\nished more severely than one who harms no one other\nthan his intended victim. Similarly, there is no reason\nwhy the measure of the appropriate punishment for en\ngaging in a campaign of deceit in distributing a poisonous\nand addictive substance to thousands of cigarette smokers\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Court\u2019s holding in Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v.\n\nKelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257 (1989), distinguished, for the pur\nposes of appellate review under the Excessive Fines Clause of the\nEighth Amendment, between criminal sanctions and civil fines\nawarded entirely to the plaintiff. The fact that part of the award in this\ncase is payable to the State lends further support to my conclusion that\nit should be treated as the functional equivalent of a criminal sanction.\nSee id., at 263\u2013264. I continue to agree with Justice O\u2019Connor and\nthose scholars who have concluded that the Excessive Fines Clause is\napplicable to punitive damages awards regardless of who receives the\nultimate payout. See id., at 286\u2013299 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part).\n   2 It is no answer to refer, as the majority does, to recidivism statutes.\n\nAnte, at 9. In that context, we have distinguished between taking prior\ncrimes into account as an aggravating factor in penalizing the conduct\nbefore the court versus doing so to punish for the earlier crimes. Ibid.\nBut if enhancing a penalty for a present crime because of prior conduct\nthat has already been punished is permissible, it is certainly proper to\nenhance a penalty because the conduct before the court, which has\nnever been punished, injured multiple victims.\n4             PHILIP MORRIS USA v.

The Court endorses a contrary conclusion with\nout providing us with any reasoned justification.\n   It is far too late in the day to argue that the Due Process\nClause merely guarantees fair procedure and imposes no\nsubstantive limits on a State\u2019s lawmaking power. See,\ne.g., Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 544 (1977)\n(White, J., dissenting); Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 540\u2013\n541 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting); Whitney v. California,\n274 U.

Clarke, Portland, OR, for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question we address today concerns a large state-court punitive damages award. We are asked whether the Constitution's Due Process Clause permits a jury to base that award in part upon its desire to <i>punish</i> the defendant for harming persons who are not before the court (<i>e.g.,</i> victims whom the parties do not represent). We hold that such an award would amount to a taking of \"property\" from the defendant without due process.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>This lawsuit arises out of the death of Jesse Williams, a heavy cigarette smoker. Respondent, Williams' widow, represents his estate in this state lawsuit for negligence and deceit against Philip Morris, the manufacturer of Marlboro, the brand that Williams favored. A jury found that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1061</span> Williams' death was caused by smoking; that Williams smoked in significant part because he thought it was safe to do so; and that Philip Morris knowingly and falsely led him to believe that this was so. The jury ultimately found that Philip Morris was negligent (as was Williams) and that Philip Morris had engaged in deceit. In respect to deceit, the claim at issue here, it awarded compensatory damages of about $821,000 (about $21,000 economic and $800,000 noneconomic) along with $79.5 million in punitive damages.</p>\n<p>The trial judge subsequently found the $79.5 million punitive damages award \"excessive,\" see, <i>e.g., </i><i>BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118026\"><a href=\"/opinion/118026/bmw-of-north-america-inc-v-gore/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span>, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996), and reduced it to $32 million. Both sides appealed. The Oregon Court of Appeals rejected Philip Morris' arguments and restored the $79.5 million jury award. Subsequently, Philip Morris sought review in the Oregon Supreme Court (which denied review) and then here. We remanded the case in light of <i>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127910\"><a href=\"/opinion/127910/state-farm-mut-automobile-ins-co-v-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003). <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></span>, 124 S.Ct. 56, 157 L.Ed.2d 12 (2003). The Oregon Court of Appeals adhered to its original views. And Philip Morris sought, and this time obtained, review in the Oregon Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Philip Morris then made two arguments relevant here. First, it said that the trial court should have accepted, but did not accept, a proposed \"punitive damages\" instruction that specified the jury could not seek to punish Philip Morris for injury to other persons not before the court. In particular, Philip Morris pointed out that the plaintiff's attorney had told the jury to \"think about how many other Jesse Williams in the last 40 years in the State of Oregon there have been. ... In Oregon, how many people do we see outside, driving home ... smoking cigarettes? ... [C]igarettes ... are going to kill ten [of every hundred]. [And] the market share of Marlboros [<i>i.e.,</i> Philip Morris] is one-third [<i>i.e.,</i> one of every three killed].\" App. 197a, 199a. In light of this argument, Philip Morris asked the trial court to tell the jury that \"you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what [the] reasonable relationship is\" between any punitive award and \"the harm caused to Jesse Williams\" by Philip Morris' misconduct, \"[but] you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons, who may bring lawsuits of their own in which other juries can resolve their claims ....\" <i>Id.,</i> at 280a. The judge rejected this proposal and instead told the jury that \"[p]unitive damages are awarded against a defendant to punish misconduct and to deter misconduct,\" and \"are not intended to compensate the plaintiff or anyone else for damages caused by the defendant's conduct.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 283a. In Philip Morris' view, the result was a significant likelihood that a portion of the $79.5 million award represented punishment for its having harmed others, a punishment that the Due Process Clause would here forbid.</p>\n<p>Second, Philip Morris pointed to the roughly 100-to-1 ratio the $79.5 million punitive damages award bears to $821,000 in compensatory damages. Philip Morris noted that this Court in <i>BMW</i> emphasized the constitutional need for punitive damages awards to reflect (1) the \"reprehensibility\" of the defendant's conduct, (2) a \"reasonable relationship\" to the harm the plaintiff (or related victim) suffered, and (3) the presence (or absence) of \"sanctions,\" <i>e.g.,</i> criminal penalties, that state law provided for comparable conduct, 517 U.S., at 575-585, 116 S.Ct. 1589. And in <i>State Farm,</i> this Court said that the longstanding historical practice of setting punitive damages at two, three, or four times <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1062</span> the size of compensatory damages, while \"not binding,\" is \"instructive,\" and that \"[s]ingle-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process.\" 538 U.S., at 425, 123 S.Ct. 1513. Philip Morris claimed that, in light of this case law, the punitive award was \"grossly excessive.\" See <i>TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112900\"><a href=\"/opinion/112900/txo-production-corp-v-alliance-resources-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 458, 113 S.Ct. 2711, 125 L.Ed.2d 366 (1993) (plurality opinion); <i>BMW, supra,</i> at 574-575, 116 S.Ct. 1589; <i>State Farm, supra,</i> at 416-417, 123 S.Ct. 1513.</p>\n<p>The Oregon Supreme Court rejected these and other Philip Morris arguments. In particular, it rejected Philip Morris' claim that the Constitution prohibits a state jury \"from using punitive damages to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"835685\"><a href=\"/opinion/835685/williams-v-philip-morris-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 51-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"835685\"><a href=\"/opinion/835685/williams-v-philip-morris-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1165</span></a></span>, 1175 (2006).

It asked us to consider, among other things, (1) its claim that Oregon had unconstitutionally permitted it to be punished for harming nonparty victims; and (2) whether Oregon had in effect disregarded \"the constitutional requirement that punitive damages be reasonably related to the plaintiff's harm.\" Pet. for Cert. (I). We granted certiorari limited to these two questions.</p>\n<p>For reasons we shall set forth, we consider only the first of these questions. We vacate the Oregon Supreme Court's judgment, and we remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This Court has long made clear that \"[p]unitive damages may properly be imposed to further a State's legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition.\" <i>BMW, supra,</i> at 568, 116 S.Ct. 1589.

At the same time, we have emphasized the need to avoid an arbitrary determination of an award's amount. Unless a State insists upon proper standards that will cabin the jury's discretionary authority, its punitive damages system may deprive a defendant of \"fair notice ... of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose,\" <i>BMW, supra,</i> at 574, 116 S.Ct. 1589; it may threaten \"arbitrary punishments,\" <i>i.e.,</i> punishments that reflect not an \"application of law\" but \"a decisionmaker's caprice,\" <i>State Farm, supra,</i> at 416, 418, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (internal quotation marks omitted); and, where the amounts are sufficiently large, it may impose one State's (or one jury's) \"policy choice,\" say as to the conditions under which (or even whether) certain products can be sold, upon \"neighboring States\" with different public policies, <i>BMW, supra,</i> at 571-572, 116 S.Ct. 1589.</p>\n<p>For these and similar reasons, this Court has found that the Constitution imposes certain limits, in respect both to procedures for awarding punitive damages and to amounts forbidden as \"grossly excessive.\" See <i>Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117862\"><a href=\"/opinion/117862/honda-motor-co-v-oberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 432, 114 S.Ct. 2331, 129 L.Ed.2d 336 (1994) (requiring judicial review of the size of punitive awards); <i>Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118424\"><a href=\"/opinion/118424/cooper-industries-inc-v-leatherman-tool-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 443, 121 S.Ct. 1678, 149 L.Ed.2d 674 (2001) (review must be <i>de novo</i>); <i>BMW, supra,</i> at 574-585, 116 S.Ct. 1589 (excessiveness decision depends upon the reprehensibility of the defendant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1063</span> conduct, whether the award bears a reasonable relationship to the actual and potential harm caused by the defendant to the plaintiff, and the difference between the award and sanctions \"authorized or imposed in comparable cases\"); <i>State Farm, supra,</i> at 425, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (excessiveness more likely where ratio exceeds single digits). Because we shall not decide whether the award here at issue is \"grossly excessive,\" we need now only consider the Constitution's procedural limitations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In our view, the Constitution's Due Process Clause forbids a State to use a punitive damages award to punish a defendant for injury that it inflicts upon nonparties or those whom they directly represent, <i>i.e.,</i> injury that it inflicts upon those who are, essentially, strangers to the litigation. For one thing, the Due Process Clause prohibits a State from punishing an individual without first providing that individual with \"an opportunity to present every available defense.\" <i>Lindsey v. Normet,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108466\"><a href=\"/opinion/108466/lindsey-v-normet/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 66, 92 S.Ct. 862, 31 L.Ed.2d 36 (1972) (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet a defendant threatened with punishment for injuring a nonparty victim has no opportunity to defend against the charge, by showing, for example in a case such as this, that the other victim was not entitled to damages because he or she knew that smoking was dangerous or did not rely upon the defendant's statements to the contrary.</p>\n<p>For another, to permit punishment for injuring a nonparty victim would add a near standardless dimension to the punitive damages equation. How many such victims are there? How seriously were they injured? Under what circumstances did injury occur? The trial will not likely answer such questions as to nonparty victims. The jury will be left to speculate. And the fundamental due process concerns to which our punitive damages cases refer\u0097risks of arbitrariness, uncertainty and lack of notice\u0097will be magnified. <i>State Farm,</i> 538 U.S., at 416, 418, 123 S.Ct. 1513; <i>BMW,</i> 517 U.S., at 574, 116 S.Ct. 1589.</p>\n<p>Finally, we can find no authority supporting the use of punitive damages awards for the purpose of punishing a defendant for harming others. We have said that it may be appropriate to consider the reasonableness of a punitive damages award in light of the <i>potential</i> harm the defendant's conduct could have caused. But we have made clear that the potential harm at issue was harm potentially caused <i>the plaintiff.</i> See <i>State Farm, supra,</i> at 424, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (\"[W]e have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, <i>to the plaintiff</i> and the punitive damages award\" (emphasis added)). See also <i>TXO,</i> 509 U.S., at 460-462, 113 S.Ct. 2711 (plurality opinion) (using same kind of comparison as basis for finding a punitive award not unconstitutionally excessive). We did use the term \"error-free\" (in <i>BMW</i>) to describe a lower court punitive damages calculation that likely included harm to others in the equation. 517 U.S., at 568, n. 11, 116 S.Ct. 1589. But context makes clear that the term \"error-free\" in the <i>BMW</i> footnote referred to errors relevant to the case at hand. Although elsewhere in <i>BMW</i> we noted that there was no suggestion that the plaintiff \"or any other BMW purchaser was threatened with any additional potential harm\" by the defendant's conduct, we did not purport to decide the question of harm to others. <i>Id.,</i> at 582, 116 S.Ct. 1589. Rather, the opinion appears to have left the question open.</p>\n<p>Respondent argues that she is free to show harm to other victims because it is relevant to a different part of the punitive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1064</span> damages constitutional equation, namely, reprehensibility. That is to say, harm to others shows more reprehensible conduct. Philip Morris, in turn, does not deny that a plaintiff may show harm to others in order to demonstrate reprehensibility. Nor do we. Evidence of actual harm to nonparties can help to show that the conduct that harmed the plaintiff also posed a substantial risk of harm to the general public, and so was particularly reprehensible\u0097although counsel may argue in a particular case that conduct resulting in no harm to others nonetheless posed a grave risk to the public, or the converse. Yet for the reasons given above, a jury may not go further than this and use a punitive damages verdict to punish a defendant directly on account of harms it is alleged to have visited on nonparties.</p>\n<p>Given the risks of unfairness that we have mentioned, it is constitutionally important for a court to provide assurance that the jury will ask the right question, not the wrong one. And given the risks of arbitrariness, the concern for adequate notice, and the risk that punitive damages awards can, in practice, impose one State's (or one jury's) policies (<i>e.g.,</i> banning cigarettes) upon other States\u0097all of which accompany awards that, today, may be many times the size of such awards in the 18th and 19th centuries, see <i>id.,</i> at 594-595, 116 S.Ct. 1589 (BREYER, J., concurring)\u0097it is particularly important that States avoid procedure that unnecessarily deprives juries of proper legal guidance. We therefore conclude that the Due Process Clause requires States to provide assurance that juries are not asking the wrong question, <i>i.e.,</i> seeking, not simply to determine reprehensibility, but also to punish for harm caused strangers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Respondent suggests as well that the Oregon Supreme Court, in essence, agreed with us, that it did not authorize punitive damages awards based upon punishment for harm caused to nonparties. We concede that one might read some portions of the Oregon Supreme Court's opinion as focusing only upon reprehensibility. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 340 Ore., at 51, 127 P.3d, at 1175 (\"[T]he jury could consider whether Williams and his misfortune were merely exemplars of the harm that Philip Morris was prepared to inflict on the smoking public at large\"). But the Oregon court's opinion elsewhere makes clear that that court held more than these few phrases might suggest.</p>\n<p>The instruction that Philip Morris said the trial court should have given distinguishes between using harm to others as part of the \"reasonable relationship\" equation (which it would allow) and using it directly as a basis for punishment. The instruction asked the trial court to tell the jury that \"you <i>may</i> consider the extent of harm suffered by others <i>in determining what [the] reasonable relationship is</i>\" between Philip Morris' punishable misconduct and harm caused to Jesse Williams, \"<i>[but] you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons, who may bring lawsuits of their own</i> in which other juries can resolve their claims ....\" App. 280a (emphasis added). And as the Oregon Supreme Court explicitly recognized, Philip Morris argued that the Constitution \"prohibits the state, acting through a civil jury, from using punitive damages to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties.\" 340 Ore., at 51-52, 127 P.3d, at 1175.</p>\n<p>The court rejected that claim. In doing so, it pointed out (1) that this Court in <i>State Farm</i> had held only that a jury could not base its award upon \"dissimilar\" acts of a defendant. 340 Ore., at 52-53, 127 P.3d, at 1175-1176. It added (2) that \"[i]f <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1065</span> a jury cannot punish for the conduct, then it is difficult to see why it may consider it at all.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 52, n. 3, 127 P.3d, at 1175, n. 3. And it stated (3) that \"[i]t is unclear to us how a jury could `consider' harm to others, yet withhold that consideration from the punishment calculus.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Oregon court's first statement is correct. We did not previously hold explicitly that a jury may not punish for the harm caused others. But we do so hold now. We do not agree with the Oregon court's second statement. We have explained why we believe the Due Process Clause prohibits a State's inflicting punishment for harm caused strangers to the litigation. At the same time we recognize that conduct that risks harm to many is likely more reprehensible than conduct that risks harm to only a few. And a jury consequently may take this fact into account in determining reprehensibility. Cf., <i>e.g., </i><i>Witte v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117954\"><a href=\"/opinion/117954/witte-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 400, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (recidivism statutes taking into account a criminal defendant's other misconduct do not impose an \"`additional penalty for the earlier crimes,' but instead ... `a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one'\" (quoting <i>Gryger v. Burke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104578\"><a href=\"/opinion/104578/gryger-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span>, 732, 68 S.Ct. 1256, 92 L.Ed. 1683 (1948))).</p>\n<p>The Oregon court's third statement raises a practical problem. How can we know whether a jury, in taking account of harm caused others under the rubric of reprehensibility, also seeks to <i>punish</i> the defendant for having caused injury to others? Our answer is that state courts cannot authorize procedures that create an unreasonable and unnecessary risk of any such confusion occurring. In particular, we believe that where the risk of that misunderstanding is a significant one\u0097because, for instance, of the sort of evidence that was introduced at trial or the kinds of argument the plaintiff made to the jury\u0097a court, upon request, must protect against that risk. Although the States have some flexibility to determine what <i>kind</i> of procedures they will implement, federal constitutional law obligates them to provide <i>some</i> form of protection in appropriate cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>As the preceding discussion makes clear, we believe that the Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong constitutional standard when considering Philip Morris' appeal. We remand this case so that the Oregon Supreme Court can apply the standard we have set forth. Because the application of this standard may lead to the need for a new trial, or a change in the level of the punitive damages award, we shall not consider whether the award is constitutionally \"grossly excessive.\" We vacate the Oregon Supreme Court's judgment and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes both substantive and procedural constraints on the power of the States to impose punitive damages on tortfeasors.

I remain firmly convinced that the cases announcing those constraints were correctly decided. In my view the Oregon Supreme Court faithfully applied the reasoning in those opinions to the egregious facts disclosed by this record. I agree with Justice GINSBURG's explanation of why no procedural error even arguably justifying reversal occurred at the trial in this case. See <i>post,</i> p. 1068-1069.</p>\n<p>Of greater importance to me, however, is the Court's imposition of a novel limit on the State's power to impose punishment in civil litigation. Unlike the Court, I see no reason why an interest in punishing a wrongdoer \"for harming persons who are not before the court,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1060, should not be taken into consideration when assessing the appropriate sanction for reprehensible conduct.</p>\n<p>Whereas compensatory damages are measured by the harm the defendant has caused the plaintiff, punitive damages are a sanction for the public harm the defendant's conduct has caused or threatened. There is little difference between the justification for a criminal sanction, such as a fine or a term of imprisonment, and an award of punitive damages. See <i>Cooper Industries,</i> 532 U.S., at 432, 121 S.Ct. 1678. In our early history either type of sanction might have been imposed in litigation prosecuted by a private citizen. See <i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 127-128, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). And while in neither context would the sanction typically include a pecuniary award measured by the harm that the conduct had caused to any third parties, in both contexts the harm to third parties would surely be a relevant factor to consider in evaluating the reprehensibility of the defendant's wrongdoing. We have never held otherwise.</p>\n<p>In the case before us, evidence attesting to the possible harm the defendant's extensive deceitful conduct caused other Oregonians was properly presented to the jury. No evidence was offered to establish an appropriate measure of damages to compensate such third parties for their injuries, and no one argued that the punitive damages award would serve any such purpose. To award compensatory damages to remedy such third-party harm might well constitute a taking of property from the defendant without due process, see <i>ante,</i> at 1060. But a punitive damages award, instead of serving a compensatory purpose, serves the entirely different purposes of retribution and deterrence that underlie every criminal sanction. <i>State Farm,</i> 538 U.S., at 416, 123 S.Ct. 1513. This justification for punitive damages has even greater salience when, as in this case, see Ore.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 31.735(1) (2003), the award is payable in whole or in part to the State rather than to the private litigant.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>While apparently recognizing the novelty of its holding, <i>ante,</i> at 1065, the majority relies on a distinction between taking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1067</span> third-party harm into account in order to assess the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct\u0097which is permitted\u0097from doing so in order to punish the defendant \"directly\"\u0097which is forbidden. <i>Ante,</i> at 1064. This nuance eludes me. When a jury increases a punitive damages award because injuries to third parties enhanced the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, the jury is by definition punishing the defendant\u0097directly\u0097for third-party harm.<sup>[2]</sup> A murderer who kills his victim by throwing a bomb that injures dozens of bystanders should be punished more severely than one who harms no one other than his intended victim. Similarly, there is no reason why the measure of the appropriate punishment for engaging in a campaign of deceit in distributing a poisonous and addictive substance to thousands of cigarette smokers statewide should not include consideration of the harm to those \"bystanders\" as well as the harm to the individual plaintiff. The Court endorses a contrary conclusion without providing us with any reasoned justification.</p>\n<p>It is far too late in the day to argue that the Due Process Clause merely guarantees fair procedure and imposes no substantive limits on a State's lawmaking power.

It matters not that the Court styles today's holding as \"procedural\" because the \"procedural\" rule is simply a confusing implementation of the substantive due process regime this Court has created for punitive damages. See <i>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.

It is ... clear that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1068</span> no particular procedures were deemed necessary to circumscribe a jury's discretion regarding the award of such damages, or their amount\"). Today's opinion proves once again that this Court's punitive damages jurisprudence is \"insusceptible of principled application.\" <i>BMW of North America, Inc. v.

Punish for what? Not for harm actually caused \"strangers to the litigation,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1063, the Court states, but for the <i>reprehensibility</i> of defendant's conduct, <i>ante,</i> at 1063-1064. \"[C]onduct that risks harm to many,\" the Court observes, \"is likely more reprehensible than conduct that risks harm to only a few.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1065. The Court thus conveys that, when punitive damages are at issue, a jury is properly instructed to consider the extent of harm suffered by others as a measure of reprehensibility, but not to mete out punishment for injuries in fact sustained by nonparties. <i>Ante,</i> at 1063-1065. The Oregon courts did not rule otherwise. They have endeavored to follow our decisions, most recently in <i>BMW of North America, Inc. v.

Vacation of the Oregon Supreme Court's judgment, I am convinced, is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>The right question regarding reprehensibility, the Court acknowledges, <i>ante,</i> at ____8, would train on \"the harm that Philip Morris was prepared to inflict on the smoking public at large.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"835685\"><a href=\"/opinion/835685/williams-v-philip-morris-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"835685\"><a href=\"/opinion/835685/williams-v-philip-morris-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1165</span></a></span>, 1175 (2006)). See also 340 Ore., at 55, 127 P.3d, at 1177 (\"[T]he jury, <i>in assessing the reprehensibility of Philip Morris's actions,</i> could consider evidence of similar harm to other Oregonians caused (or threatened) by the same conduct.\" (emphasis added)). The Court identifies no evidence introduced and no charge delivered inconsistent with that inquiry.</p>\n<p>The Court's order vacating the Oregon Supreme Court's judgment is all the more inexplicable considering that Philip Morris did not preserve any objection to the charges in fact delivered to the jury, to the evidence introduced at trial, or to opposing counsel's argument. The sole objection Philip Morris preserved was to the trial court's refusal to give defendant's requested charge number 34. See <i>id.,</i> at 54, 127 P.3d, at 1176. The proposed instruction read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"If you determine that some amount of punitive damages should be imposed on the defendant, it will then be your task to set an amount that is appropriate. This should be such amount as you believe is necessary to achieve the objectives of deterrence and punishment. While there is no set formula to be applied in reaching an appropriate amount, I will now advise you of some of the factors that you may wish to consider in this connection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) The size of any punishment should bear a reasonable relationship to the harm caused to Jesse Williams by the defendant's punishable misconduct. Although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what that reasonable relationship is, you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1069</span> persons, who may bring lawsuits of their own in which other juries can resolve their claims and award punitive damages for those harms, as such other juries see fit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) The size of the punishment may appropriately reflect the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct\u0097that is, how far the defendant has departed from accepted societal norms of conduct.\" App. 280a.</blockquote>\n<p>Under that charge, just what use could the jury properly make of \"the extent of harm suffered by others\"? The answer slips from my grasp. A judge seeking to enlighten rather than confuse surely would resist delivering the requested charge.</p>\n<p>The Court ventures no opinion on the propriety of the charge proposed by Philip Morris, though Philip Morris preserved no other objection to the trial proceedings. Rather than addressing the one objection Philip Morris properly preserved, the Court reaches outside the bounds of the case as postured when the trial court entered its judgment. I would accord more respectful treatment to the proceedings and dispositions of state courts that sought diligently to adhere to our changing, less than crystalline precedent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, and in light of the abundant evidence of \"the potential harm [Philip Morris'] conduct could have caused,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1063 (emphasis deleted), I would affirm the decision of the Oregon Supreme Court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Court's holding in <i>Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112324\"><a href=\"/opinion/112324/browning-ferris-industries-of-vt-inc-v-kelco-dispo/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2909, 106 L.Ed.2d 219 (1989), distinguished, for the purposes of appellate review under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, between criminal sanctions and civil fines awarded entirely to the plaintiff. The fact that part of the award in this case is payable to the State lends further support to my conclusion that it should be treated as the functional equivalent of a criminal sanction. See <i>id.,</i> at 263-264, 109 S.Ct. 2909. I continue to agree with Justice O'Connor and those scholars who have concluded that the Excessive Fines Clause is applicable to punitive damages awards regardless of who receives the ultimate payout. See <i>id.,</i> at 286-299, 109 S.Ct. 2909 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>[2]  It is no answer to refer, as the majority does, to recidivism statutes. <i>Ante,</i> at 1065. In that context, we have distinguished between taking prior crimes into account as an aggravating factor in penalizing the conduct before the court versus doing so to punish for the earlier crimes. <i>Ibid.</i> But if enhancing a penalty for a present crime because of prior conduct that has already been punished is permissible, it is certainly proper to enhance a penalty because the conduct before the court, which has never been punished, injured multiple victims.</p>\n\n</div>",
