Laurence, Deputy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*860</span> Attorney General, Counsel of Record, San Francisco, CA, for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>California's determinate sentencing law (DSL) assigns to the trial judge, not to the jury, authority to find the facts that expose a defendant to an elevated \"upper term\" sentence. The facts so found are neither inherent in the jury's verdict nor embraced by the defendant's plea, and they need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt. The question presented is whether the DSL, by placing sentence-elevating factfinding within the judge's province, violates a defendant's right to trial by jury safeguarded by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p>As this Court's decisions instruct, the Federal Constitution's jury-trial guarantee proscribes a sentencing scheme that allows a judge to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum based on a fact, other than a prior conviction, not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <i>Ring v. Arizona,</i> 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002); <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). \"[T]he relevant `statutory maximum,'\" this Court has clarified, \"is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <i>without</i> any additional findings.\" <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 303-304, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis in original). In petitioner's case, the jury's verdict alone limited the permissible sentence to 12 years. Additional factfinding by the trial judge, however, yielded an upper term sentence of 16 years. The California Court of Appeal affirmed the harsher sentence. We reverse that disposition because the four-year elevation based on judicial factfinding denied petitioner his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Petitioner John Cunningham was tried and convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14. Under the DSL, that offense is punishable by imprisonment for a lower term sentence of 6 years, a middle term sentence of 12 years, or an upper term sentence of 16 years. Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 288.5(a) (West 1999) (hereinafter Penal Code). As further explained below, see <i>infra,</i> at 861-863, the DSL obliged the trial judge to sentence Cunningham to the 12-year middle term unless the judge found one or more additional facts in aggravation. Based on a post-trial sentencing hearing, the trial judge found by a preponderance of the evidence six aggravating circumstances, among them, the particular vulnerability of Cunningham's victim, and Cunningham's violent conduct, which indicated a serious danger to the community. Tr. of Sentencing (Aug. 1, 2003), App. 22.<sup>[1]</sup> In mitigation, the judge found one fact: Cunningham had no record of prior criminal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*861</span> conduct. <i>Ibid.</i> Concluding that the aggravators outweighed the sole mitigator, the judge sentenced Cunningham to the upper term of 16 years. <i>Id.,</i> at 23.</p>\n<p>A panel of the California Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction and sentence; one judge dissented in part, urging that this Court's precedent precluded the judge-determined four-year increase in Cunningham's sentence. No. A103501 (Apr. 18, 2005), App. 43-48; <i>id.,</i> at 48-50 (Jones, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).<sup>[2]</sup> The California Supreme Court denied review. No. S133971 (June 29, 2005) (en banc), <i>id.,</i> at 52. In a reasoned decision published nine days earlier, that court considered the question here presented and held that the DSL survived Sixth Amendment inspection. <i>People v. Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th 1238, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d 534 (June 20, 2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Enacted in 1977, the DSL replaced an indeterminate sentencing regime in force in California for some 60 years. See <i>id.,</i> at 1246, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 537; Cassou &amp; Taugher, Determinate Sentencing in California: The New Numbers Game, 9 Pac. L.J. 5, 6-22 (1978) (hereinafter Cassou &amp; Taugher). Under the prior regime, courts imposed open-ended prison terms (often one year to life), and the parole boardthe Adult Authoritydetermined the amount of time a felon would ultimately spend in prison. <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1246, 1256, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 537, 544; <i>In re Roberts,</i> 36 Cal.4th 575, 588, n. 6, 31 Cal.Rptr.3d 458, 115 P.3d 1121, 1129, n. 6 (2005); Cassou &amp; Taugher 5-9. In contrast, the DSL fixed the terms of imprisonment for most offenses, and eliminated the possibility of early release on parole. See Penal Code § 3000 <i>et seq.</i> (West Supp.2006); 3 B. Witkin &amp; N. Epstein, California Criminal Law § 610, p. 809 (3d ed.2000); Brief for Respondent 7.<sup>[3]</sup> Through the DSL, California's lawmakers aimed to promote uniform and proportionate punishment. Penal Code § 1170(a)(1); <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1246, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 537.</p>\n<p>For most offenses, including Cunningham's, the DSL regime is implemented in the following manner. The statute defining the offense prescribes three precise terms of imprisonmenta lower, middle, and upper term sentence. <i>E.g.,</i> Penal Code § 288.5(a) (West 1999) (a person convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child \"shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of 6, 12, or 16 years\"). See also <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1247, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 538. Penal Code § 1170(b) (West Supp.2006) controls the trial judge's choice; it provides that \"the court shall order imposition of the middle term, unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.\" \"[C]ircumstances in aggravation or mitigation\" are to be determined by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*862</span> the court after consideration of several items: the trial record; the probation officer's report; statements in aggravation or mitigation submitted by the parties, the victim, or the victim's family; \"and any further evidence introduced at the sentencing hearing.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The DSL directed the State's Judicial Council<sup>[4]</sup> to adopt Rules guiding the sentencing judge's decision whether to \"[i]mpose the lower or upper prison term.\" Penal Code § 1170.3(a)(2) (West 2004).<sup>[5]</sup> Restating § 1170(b), the Council's Rules provide that \"[t]he middle term shall be selected unless imposition of the upper or lower term is justified by circumstances in aggravation or mitigation.\" Rule 4.420(a). \"Circumstances in aggravation,\" as crisply defined by the Judicial Council, means \"<i>facts</i> which justify the imposition of the upper prison term.\" Rule 4.405(d) (emphasis added). Facts aggravating an offense, the Rules instruct, \"shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence,\" Rule 4.420(b),<sup>[6]</sup> and must be \"stated orally on the record.\" Rule 4.420(e).</p>\n<p>The Rules provide a nonexhaustive list of aggravating circumstances, including \"[f]acts relating to the crime,\" Rule 4.421(a),<sup>[7]</sup> \"[f]acts relating to the defendant,\" Rule 4.421(b),<sup>[8]</sup> and \"[a]ny other facts statutorily declared to be circumstances in aggravation,\" Rule 4.421(c). Beyond the enumerated circumstances, \"the judge is free to consider any `additional criteria reasonably related to the decision being made.'\" <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1247, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 538 (quoting Rule 4.408(a)). \"A fact that is an element of the crime,\" however, \"shall not be used to impose the upper term.\" Rule 4.420(d). In sum, California's DSL, and the rules governing its application, direct the sentencing court to start with the middle term, and to move from that term only when the court itself finds and places on the record factswhether related to the offense or the offenderbeyond the elements of the charged offense.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO maintains, however, that a circumstance in aggravation need not be a fact at all. In his view, a policy judgment, or even a judge's \"subjective belief\" regarding the appropriate sentence, qualifies as an aggravating circumstance. <i>Post,</i> at 879-880 (dissenting opinion). California's Rules, however, constantly refer to \"facts.\" As just noted, the Rules define \"circumstances in aggravation\" as \"<i>facts</i> which justify the imposition of the upper <span class=\"star-pagination\">*863</span> prison term.\" Rule 4.405(d) (emphasis added).<sup>[9]</sup> And \"circumstances in aggravation,\" the Rules unambiguously declare, \"shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence,\" Rule 4.420(b), a clear factfinding directive to which there is no exception. See <i>People v. Hall,</i> 8 Cal.4th 950, 957, 35 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 883 P.2d 974, 978 (1994) (\"Selection of the upper term is justified <i>only</i> if circumstances in aggravation are established by a preponderance of evidence ....\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>While the Rules list \"[g]eneral objectives of sentencing,\" Rule 4.410(a), nowhere are these objectives cast as \"circumstances in aggravation\" that alone authorize an upper term sentence. The Rules also state that \"[t]he enumeration ... of some criteria for the making of discretionary sentencing decisions does not prohibit the application of additional criteria reasonably related to the decision being made.\" Rule 4.408(a). California courts have not read this language to unmoor \"circumstances in aggravation\" from any factfinding anchor.</p>\n<p>In line with the Rules, the California Supreme Court has repeatedly referred to circumstances in aggravation as facts. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1256, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544 (\"The Legislature did not identify all of the particular <i>facts</i> that could justify the upper term.\" (emphasis added)); <i>People v. Wiley,</i> 9 Cal.4th 580, 587, 38 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, 889 P.2d 541, 545 (1995) (\"[T]rial courts are assigned the task of deciding whether to impose an upper or lower term of imprisonment based upon their determination whether there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime, <i>a determination that invariably requires numerous factual findings.</i>\" (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>It is unsurprising, then, that State's counsel, at oral argument, acknowledged that he knew of no case in which a California trial judge had gone beyond the middle term based not on any fact the judge found, but solely on the basis of a policy judgment or subjective belief. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 49-50.</p>\n<p>Notably, the Penal Code permits elevation of a sentence above the upper term based on specified statutory enhancements relating to the defendant's criminal history or circumstances of the crime. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Penal Code § 667 <i>et seq.</i> (West Supp. 2006); § 12022 <i>et seq.</i> See also <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1257, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 545. Unlike aggravating circumstances, statutory enhancements must be charged in the indictment, and the underlying facts must be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Penal Code § 1170.1(e); <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1257, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 545. A fact underlying an enhancement cannot do double duty; it cannot be used to impose an upper term sentence and, on top of that, an enhanced term. Penal Code § 1170(b). Where permitted by statute, however, a judge may use a fact qualifying as an enhancer to impose an upper term rather than an enhanced sentence. <i>Ibid.;</i> Rule 4.420(c).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This Court has repeatedly held that, under the Sixth Amendment, any fact that exposes a defendant to a greater potential sentence must be found by a jury, not a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*864</span> judge, and established beyond a reasonable doubt, not merely by a preponderance of the evidence. While this rule is rooted in longstanding common-law practice, its explicit statement in our decisions is recent. In <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), we examined the Sixth Amendment's historical and doctrinal foundations, and recognized that judicial factfinding operating to increase a defendant's otherwise maximum punishment posed a grave constitutional question. <i>Id.,</i> at 239-252, 119 S.Ct. 1215. While the Court construed the statute at issue to avoid the question, the <i>Jones</i> opinion presaged our decision, some 15 months later, in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p>Charles Apprendi was convicted of possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose, a second-degree offense under New Jersey law punishable by five to ten years' imprisonment. <i>Id.,</i> at 468, 120 S.Ct. 2348. A separate \"hate crime\" statute authorized an \"extended term\" of imprisonment: Ten to twenty years could be imposed if the trial judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \"`[t]he defendant in committing the crime acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 468-469, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (quoting N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:44-3(e) (West Supp.1999-2000)). The judge in Apprendi's case so found, and therefore sentenced the defendant to 12 years' imprisonment. This Court held that the Sixth Amendment proscribed the enhanced sentence. 530 U.S., at 471, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Other than a prior conviction, see <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 239-247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), we held in <i>Apprendi,</i> \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. See also <i>Harris v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 545, 557-566, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (plurality opinion) (\"<i>Apprendi</i> said that any fact extending the defendant's sentence beyond the maximum authorized by the jury's verdict would have been considered an element of an aggravated crimeand thus the domain of the juryby those who framed the Bill of Rights.\").</p>\n<p>We have since reaffirmed the rule of <i>Apprendi,</i> applying it to facts subjecting a defendant to the death penalty, <i>Ring v. Arizona,</i> 536 U.S. 584, 602, 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), facts permitting a sentence in excess of the \"standard range\" under Washington's Sentencing Reform Act, <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 304-305, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and facts triggering a sentence range elevation under the then-mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines, <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 243-244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <i>Blakely</i> and <i>Booker</i> bear most closely on the question presented in this case.</p>\n<p>Ralph Howard Blakely was convicted of second-degree kidnapping with a firearm, a class B felony under Washington law. <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 298-299, 124 S.Ct. 2531. While the overall statutory maximum for a class B felony was ten years, the State's Sentencing Reform Act (Reform Act) added an important qualification: If no facts beyond those reflected in the jury's verdict were found by the trial judge, a defendant could not receive a sentence above a \"standard range\" of 49 to 53 months. <i>Id.,</i> at 299-300, 124 S.Ct. 2531. The Reform Act permitted but did not require a judge to exceed that standard range if she found \"`substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*865</span> sentence.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 9.94A.120(2) (2000)). The Reform Act set out a nonexhaustive list of aggravating facts on which such a sentence elevation could be based. It also clarified that a fact taken into account in fixing the standard range<i>i.e.,</i> any fact found by the jurycould under no circumstances count in the determination whether to impose an exceptional sentence. 542 U.S., at 299-300, 124 S.Ct. 2531. Blakely was sentenced to 90 months' imprisonment, more than three years above the standard range, based on the trial judge's finding that he had acted with deliberate cruelty. <i>Id.,</i> at 300, 124 S.Ct. 2531.</p>\n<p>Applying the rule of <i>Apprendi,</i> this Court held Blakely's sentence unconstitutional. The State in <i>Blakely</i> had endeavored to distinguish <i>Apprendi</i> on the ground that \"[u]nder the Washington guidelines, an exceptional sentence is within the court's discretion as a result of a guilty verdict.\" Brief for Respondent in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> O.T.2003, No. 02-1632, p. 15. We rejected that argument. The judge could not have sentenced Blakely above the standard range without finding the additional fact of deliberate cruelty. Consequently, that fact was subject to the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee. 542 U.S., at 304-314, 124 S.Ct. 2531. It did not matter, we explained, that Blakely's sentence, though outside the standard range, was within the 10-year maximum for class B felonies:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Our precedents make clear ... that the `statutory maximum' for <i>Apprendi</i> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <i>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant</i> .... In other words, the relevant `statutory maximum' is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <i>without</i> any additional findings. When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury's verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts `which the law makes essential to the punishment,' ... and the judge exceeds his proper authority.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis in original) (quoting 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure § 87, p. 55 (2d ed. 1872)).</blockquote>\n<p>Because the judge in Blakely's case could not have imposed a sentence outside the standard range without finding an additional fact, the top of that range53 months, and not 10 yearswas the relevant statutory maximum. 542 U.S., at 304, 124 S.Ct. 2531.</p>\n<p>The State had additionally argued in <i>Blakely</i> that <i>Apprendi's</i> rule was satisfied because Washington's Reform Act did not specify an exclusive catalog of potential facts on which a judge might base a departure from the standard range. This Court rejected that argument as well. \"Whether the judge's authority to impose an enhanced sentence depends on finding a specified fact ... one of several specified facts ... or <i>any</i> aggravating fact (as here),\" we observed, \"it remains the case that the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.\" 542 U.S., at 305, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis in original). Further, we held it irrelevant that the Reform Act ultimately left the decision whether or not to depart to the judge's discretion: \"Whether the judicially determined facts <i>require</i> a sentence enhancement or merely <i>allow</i> it,\" we noted, \"the verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.\" <i>Ibid.,</i> n. 8 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>Freddie Booker was convicted of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and was sentenced under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The facts found by Booker's jury yielded a base Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months' imprisonment, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*866</span> a range the judge could not exceed without undertaking additional factfinding. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 227, 233-234, 125 S.Ct. 738. The judge did so, finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Booker possessed an amount of drugs in excess of the amount determined by the jury's verdict. That finding boosted Booker into a higher Guidelines range. Booker was sentenced at the bottom of the higher range, to 360 months in prison. <i>Id.,</i> at 227, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>In an opinion written by Justice STEVENS for a five-Member majority, the Court held Booker's sentence impermissible under the Sixth Amendment. In the majority's judgment, there was \"no distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue in <i>[Blakely].</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738. Both systems were \"mandatory and impose[d] binding requirements on all sentencing judges.\" <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[10]</sup> Justice STEVENS' opinion for the Court, it bears emphasis, next expressed a view on which there was no disagreement among the Justices. He acknowledged that the Federal Guidelines would not implicate the Sixth Amendment were they advisory:</p>\n<blockquote>\"If the Guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment. We have never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range. Indeed, everyone agrees that the constitutional issues presented by [this case] would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the [federal Sentencing Reform Act] the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges.... For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The Guidelines as written, however, are not advisory; they are mandatory and binding on all judges.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>In an opinion written by Justice BREYER, also garnering a five-Member majority, the Court faced the remedial question, which turned on an assessment of legislative intent: What alteration would Congress have intended had it known that the Guidelines were vulnerable to a Sixth Amendment challenge? Three choices were apparent: the Court could invalidate in its entirety the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984(SRA), the law comprehensively delineating the federal sentencing system; or it could preserve the SRA, and the mandatory Guidelines regime the SRA established, by attaching a jury-trial requirement to any fact increasing a defendant's base Guidelines range; finally, the Court could render the Guidelines advisory by severing two provisions of the SRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1) and 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). 543 U.S., at 246-249, 125 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*867</span> S.Ct. 738.<sup>[11]</sup> Recognizing that \"reasonable minds can, and do, differ\" on the remedial question, the majority concluded that the advisory Guidelines solution came closest to the congressional mark. <i>Id.,</i> at 248-258, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>Under the system described in Justice BREYER's opinion for the Court in <i>Booker,</i> judges would no longer be tied to the sentencing range indicated in the Guidelines. But they would be obliged to \"take account of\" that range along with the sentencing goals Congress enumerated in the SRA at 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). 543 U.S., at 259, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738.<sup>[12]</sup> Having severed § 3742(e), the provision of the SRA governing appellate review of sentences under the mandatory Guidelines scheme, see <i>supra,</i> at 867, and n. 11, the Court installed, as consistent with the Act and the sound administration of justice, a \"reasonableness\" standard of review. 543 U.S., at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738. Without attempting an elaborate discussion of that standard, Justice BREYER's remedial opinion for the Court observed: \"Section 3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing. Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is reasonable.\" <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[13]</sup> The Court emphasized the provisional character of the <i>Booker</i> remedy. Recognizing that authority <span class=\"star-pagination\">*868</span> to speak \"the last word\" resides in Congress, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The ball now lies in Congress' court. The National Legislature is equipped to devise and install, long term, the sentencing system, compatible with the Constitution, that Congress judges best for the federal system of justice.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 265, 125 S.Ct. 738.</blockquote>\n<p>We turn now to the instant case in light of both parts of the Court's <i>Booker</i> opinion, and our earlier decisions in point.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Under California's DSL, an upper term sentence may be imposed only when the trial judge finds an aggravating circumstance. See <i>supra,</i> at 861-862. An element of the charged offense, essential to a jury's determination of guilt, or admitted in a defendant's guilty plea, does not qualify as such a circumstance. See <i>supra,</i> at 862-863. Instead, aggravating circumstances depend on facts found discretely and solely by the judge. In accord with <i>Blakely,</i> therefore, the middle term prescribed in California's statutes, not the upper term, is the relevant statutory maximum. 542 U.S., at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (\"[T]he `statutory maximum' for <i>Apprendi</i> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <i>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.</i>\" (emphasis in original)). Because circumstances in aggravation are found by the judge, not the jury, and need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt, see <i>supra,</i> at 862, the DSL violates <i>Apprendi's</i> bright-line rule: Except for a prior conviction, \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p>While \"[t]hat should be the end of the matter,\" <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 313, 124 S.Ct. 2531, in <i>People v. Black</i><i>,</i> the California Supreme Court held otherwise. In that court's view, the DSL survived examination under our precedent intact. See 35 Cal.4th, at 1254-1261, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 543-548. The <i>Black</i> court acknowledged that California's system appears on surface inspection to be in tension with the rule of <i>Apprendi.</i> But in \"operation and effect,\" the court said, the DSL \"simply authorize[s] a sentencing court to engage in the type of factfinding that traditionally has been incident to the judge's selection of an appropriate sentence within a statutorily prescribed sentencing range.\" 35 Cal.4th, at 1254, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 543. Therefore, the court concluded, \"the upper term is the `statutory maximum' and a trial court's imposition of an upper term sentence does not violate a defendant's right to a jury trial under the principles set forth in <i>Apprendi, Blakely,</i> and <i>Booker.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> But see <i>id.,</i> at 1270, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d 534, 29 Cal. Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 554 (Kennard, J., concurring and dissenting) (\"Nothing in the high court's majority opinions in <i>Apprendi, Blakely,</i> and <i>Booker</i> suggests that the constitutionality of a state's sentencing scheme turns on whether, in the words of the majority here, it involves the type of factfinding `that traditionally has been performed by a judge.'\" (quoting <i>id.,</i> at 1253, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d 534, 29 Cal. Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 542)).</p>\n<p>The <i>Black</i> court's conclusion that the upper term, and not the middle term, qualifies as the relevant statutory maximum, rested on several considerations. First, the court reasoned that, given the ample discretion afforded trial judges to identify aggravating facts warranting an upper term sentence, the DSL</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*869</span> \"does not represent a legislative effort to shift the proof of particular facts from elements of a crime (to be proved to a jury) to sentencing factors (to be decided by a judge).... Instead, it afforded the sentencing judge the discretion to decide, with the guidance of rules and statutes, whether the facts of the case and the history of the defendant justify the higher sentence. Such a system does not diminish the traditional power of the jury.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1256, 29 Cal. Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>We cautioned in <i>Blakely,</i> however, that broad discretion to decide what facts may support an enhanced sentence, or to determine whether an enhanced sentence is warranted in any particular case, does not shield a sentencing system from the force of our decisions. If the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence, if, instead, the judge must find an additional fact to impose the longer term, the Sixth Amendment requirement is not satisfied. <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 305, and n. 8, 124 S.Ct. 2531.</p>\n<p>The <i>Black</i> court also urged that the DSL is not cause for concern because it reduced the penalties for most crimes over the prior indeterminate sentencing regime. 35 Cal.4th, at 1256-1258, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544-545. But see <i>id.,</i> at 1271-1272, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 555 (Kennard, J., concurring and dissenting) (\"This aspect of our sentencing law does not differ significantly from the Washington sentencing scheme [the high court invalidated in <i>Blakely.</i>]\"); <i>supra,</i> at 865. Furthermore, California's system is not unfair to defendants, for they \"cannot reasonably expect a guarantee that the upper term will not be imposed\" given judges' broad discretion to impose an upper term sentence or to keep their punishment at the middle term. 35 Cal.4th, at 1258-1259, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 545-546. The <i>Black</i> court additionally noted that the DSL requires statutory enhancements (as distinguished from aggravators)<i>e.g.,</i> the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon, infliction of great bodily injury, Penal Code §§ 12022, 12022.7-.8 (West 2000 and Supp.2006)to be charged in the indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 35 Cal.4th, at 1257, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 545.</p>\n<p>The <i>Black</i> court's examination of the DSL, in short, satisfied it that California's sentencing system does not implicate significantly the concerns underlying the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee. Our decisions, however, leave no room for such an examination. Asking whether a defendant's basic jury-trial right is preserved, though some facts essential to punishment are reserved for determination by the judge, we have said, is the <i>very</i> inquiry <i>Apprendi's</i> \"bright-line rule\" was designed to exclude. See <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 307-308, 124 S.Ct. 2531. But see <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1260, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 547 (stating, remarkably, that \"[t]he high court precedents do not draw a bright line\").<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>Ultimately, the <i>Black</i> court relied on an equation of California's DSL system to the post-<i>Booker</i> federal system. \"The level of discretion available to a California judge in selecting which of the three available terms to impose,\" the court said, \"appears <span class=\"star-pagination\">*870</span> comparable to the level of discretion that the high court has chosen to permit federal judges in post-<i>Booker</i> sentencing.\" 35 Cal.4th, at 1261, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 548. The same equation drives Justice ALITO's dissent. See <i>post,</i> at 873 (\"The California sentencing law ... is indistinguishable in any constitutionally significant respect from the advisory Guidelines scheme that the Court approved in <i>[Booker].</i>\").</p>\n<p>The attempted comparison is unavailing. As earlier explained, see <i>supra,</i> at 866-867, this Court in <i>Booker</i> held the Federal Sentencing Guidelines incompatible with the Sixth Amendment because the Guidelines were \"mandatory and imposed binding requirements on all sentencing judges.\" 543 U.S., at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738. \"[M]erely advisory provisions,\" recommending but not requiring \"the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts,\" all Members of the Court agreed, \"would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.\" <i>Ibid.</i> To remedy the constitutional infirmity found in <i>Booker,</i> the Court's majority excised provisions that rendered the system mandatory, leaving the Guidelines in place as advisory only. <i>Id.,</i> at 245-246, 125 S.Ct. 738. See also <i>supra,</i> at 866-867.</p>\n<p>California's DSL does not resemble the advisory system the <i>Booker</i> Court had in view. Under California's system, judges are not free to exercise their \"discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range.\" <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738. California's Legislature has adopted sentencing triads, three fixed sentences with no ranges between them. Cunningham's sentencing judge had no discretion to select a sentence within a range of 6 to 16 years. His instruction was to select 12 years, nothing less and nothing more, unless he found facts allowing the imposition of a sentence of 6 or 16 years. Factfinding to elevate a sentence from 12 to 16 years, our decisions make plain, falls within the province of the jury employing a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, not the bailiwick of a judge determining where the preponderance of the evidence lies.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the <i>Black</i> court attempted to rescue the DSL's judicial factfinding authority by typing it simply a reasonableness constraint, equivalent to the constraint operative in the federal system post-<i>Booker.</i> See 35 Cal.4th, at 1261, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 548 (\"Because an aggravating factor under California law may include any factor that the judge reasonably deems relevant, the [DSL's] requirement that an upper term sentence be imposed only if an aggravating factor exists is comparable to <i>Booker's</i> requirement that a federal judge's sentencing decision not be unreasonable.\"). Reasonableness, however, is not, as the <i>Black</i> court would have it, the touchstone of Sixth Amendment analysis. The reasonableness requirement <i>Booker</i> anticipated for the federal system operates <i>within</i> the Sixth Amendment constraints delineated in our precedent, not as a substitute for those constraints. Because the DSL allocates to judges sole authority to find facts permitting the imposition of an upper term sentence, the system violates the Sixth Amendment. It is comforting, but beside the point, that California's system requires judge-determined DSL sentences to be reasonable. <i>Booker's</i> remedy for the Federal Guidelines, in short, is not a recipe for rendering our Sixth Amendment case law toothless.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*871</span> To summarize: Contrary to the <i>Black</i> court's holding, our decisions from <i>Apprendi</i> to <i>Booker</i> point to the middle term specified in California's statutes, not the upper term, as the relevant statutory maximum. Because the DSL authorizes the judge, not the jury, to find the facts permitting an upper term sentence, the system cannot withstand measurement against our Sixth Amendment precedent.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>As to the adjustment of California's sentencing system in light of our decision, \"[t]he ball ... lies in [California's] court.\" <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 265, 125 S.Ct. 738; cf. <i>supra,</i> at 868. We note that several States have modified their systems in the wake of <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Blakely</i> to retain determinate sentencing. They have done so by calling upon the juryeither at trial or in a separate sentencing proceedingto find any fact necessary to the imposition of an elevated sentence.<sup>[17]</sup> As earlier noted, California already employs juries in this manner to determine statutory sentencing enhancements. See <i>supra,</i> at 863, 869. Other States have chosen to permit judges genuinely \"to exercise broad discretion ... within a statutory range,\"<sup>[18]</sup> which, \"everyone agrees,\" encounters no Sixth Amendment shoal. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738. California may follow the paths taken by its sister States or otherwise alter its system, so long as the State observes Sixth Amendment limitations declared in this Court's decisions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the California Court of Appeal is reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*872</span> Justice KENNEDY, with whom Justice BREYER joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The dissenting opinion by Justice ALITO, which I join in full, well explains why the Court continues in a wrong and unfortunate direction in the cases following <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 326-334, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (BREYER, J., dissenting in part); <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 314-324, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (O'Connor, J., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 326-328, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting); see also <i>Apprendi, supra,</i> at 523-554, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 526 U.S. 227, 264-272, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). The discussion in his dissenting opinion is fully sufficient to show why, in my respectful view, the Court's analysis and holding are mistaken. It does seem appropriate to add this brief, further comment.</p>\n<p>In my view the <i>Apprendi</i> line of cases remains incorrect. Yet there may be a principled rationale permitting those cases to control within the central sphere of their concern, while reducing the collateral, widespread harm to the criminal justice system and the corrections process now resulting from the Court's wooden, unyielding insistence on expanding the <i>Apprendi</i> doctrine far beyond its necessary boundaries. The Court could distinguish between sentencing enhancements based on the nature of the offense, where the <i>Apprendi</i> principle would apply, and sentencing enhancements based on the nature of the offender, where it would not. California attempted to make this initial distinction. Compare Cal. Rule of Court 4.421(a) (Criminal Cases) (West 2006) (listing aggravating \"[f]acts relating to the crime\"), with Rule 4.421(b) (listing aggravating \"[f]acts relating to the defendant\"). The Court should not foreclose its efforts.</p>\n<p>California, as the Court notes, experimented earlier with an indeterminate sentencing system. <i>Ante,</i> at 858. The State reposed vast power and discretion in a nonjudicial agency to set a release date for convicted felons. That system, it seems, would have been untouched by <i>Apprendi.</i> When the State sought to reform its system, it might have chosen to give its judges the authority to sentence to a maximum but to depart downward for unexplained reasons. That too, by considerable irony, would be untouched by <i>Apprendi.</i> Instead, California sought to use a system based on guided discretion. <i>Apprendi,</i> the Court holds today, forecloses this option.</p>\n<p>As dissenting opinions have suggested before, the Constitution ought not to be interpreted to strike down all aspects of sentencing systems that grant judicial discretion with some legislative direction and control. Judges and legislators must have the capacity to develop consistent standards, standards that individual juries empaneled for only a short time cannot elaborate in any permanent way. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 314, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (opinion of O'Connor, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 326-327, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (explaining that \"[s]entencing guidelines are a prime example of [the] collaborative process\" between courts and legislatures). Judges and sentencing officials have a broad view and long-term commitment to correctional systems. Juries do not. Judicial officers and corrections professionals, under the guidance and control of the legislature, should be encouraged to participate in an ongoing manner to improve the various sentencing schemes in our country.</p>\n<p>This system of guided discretion would be permitted to a large extent if the Court confined the <i>Apprendi</i> rule to sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*873</span> enhancements based on the nature of the offense. These would include, for example, the fact that a weapon was used; violence was employed; a stated amount of drugs or other contraband was involved; or the crime was motivated by the victim's race, gender, or other status protected by statute. Juries could consider these matters without serious disruption because these factors often are part of the statutory definition of an aggravated crime in any event and because the evidence to support these enhancements is likely to be a central part of the prosecution's case.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, judicial determination is appropriate with regard to factors exhibited by the defendant. These would include, for example, prior convictions; cooperation or noncooperation with law enforcement; remorse or the lack of it; or other aspects of the defendant's history bearing upon his background and contribution to the community. This is so even if the relevant facts were to be found by the judge by a preponderance of the evidence. These are facts that should be taken into account at sentencing but have little if any significance for whether the defendant committed the crime. See Berman &amp; Bibas, Making Sentencing Sensible, 4 Ohio St. J.Crim. L. 37, 55-57 (2006).</p>\n<p>The line between offense and offender would not always be clear, but in most instances the nature of the offense is defined in a manner that ensures the problem of categories would not be difficult. <i>Apprendi</i> suffers from a similar line-drawing problem between facts that must be considered by the jury and other considerations that a judge can take into account. The main part of the <i>Apprendi</i> holding could be retained with far less systemic disruption. It is to be regretted that the Court's decision today appears to foreclose consideration of this approach or other reasonable efforts to develop systems of guided discretion within the general constraint that <i>Apprendi</i> imposes.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, with whom Justice KENNEDY and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The California sentencing law that the Court strikes down today is indistinguishable in any constitutionally significant respect from the advisory Guidelines scheme that the Court approved in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Both sentencing schemes grant trial judges considerable discretion in sentencing; both subject the exercise of that discretion to appellate review for \"reasonableness\"; and boththe California law explicitly, and the federal scheme implicitlyrequire a sentencing judge to find some factor to justify a sentence above the minimum that could be imposed based solely on the jury's verdict. Because this Court has held unequivocally that the post-<i>Booker</i> federal sentencing system satisfies the requirements of the Sixth Amendment, the same should be true with regard to the California system. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and the cases that have followed in its wake, the Court has held that under certain circumstances a criminal defendant possesses the Sixth Amendment right to have a jury find facts that result in an increased sentence. The Court, however, has never suggested that all factual findings that affect a defendant's sentence must be made by a jury. On the contrary, in <i>Apprendi</i> and later cases, the Court has consistently stated that when a trial court makes a fully discretionary sentencing decision (such as a sentencing decision under the pre-Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*874</span> federal sentencing system), the Sixth Amendment permits the court to base the sentence on its own factual findings. See <i>id.,</i> at 481, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 305, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738; see also <i>Harris v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 545, 558, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Applying this rule, the <i>Booker</i> Court unanimously agreed that judicial factfinding under a purely advisory guidelines system would likewise comport with the Sixth Amendment. Writing for the five Justices who struck down the mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines system, Justice STEVENS stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"If the Guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment. We have never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range .... For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.\" <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738.<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>In a similar vein, the remedial portion of the Court's opinion in <i>Booker,</i> written by Justice BREYER, held that the Sixth Amendment permits a system of advisory guidelines with reasonableness review.<sup>[3]</sup> Justice BREYER's opinion avoided a blanket invalidation of the Guidelines by excising the provision of the Sentencing Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), that required a sentencing judge to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range. See <i>Booker,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*875</span> 543 U.S., at 259, 125 S.Ct. 738. As Justice BREYER explained, \"the existence of § 3553(b)(1) is a necessary condition of the constitutional violation. That is to say, without this provision ... the statute falls outside the scope of <i>Apprendi's</i> requirement.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Under the post-<i>Booker</i> federal sentencing system, \"[t]he district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. In addition, sentencing courts must take account of the general sentencing goals set forth by Congress, including avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities, providing restitution to victims, reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment, affording adequate deterrence, protecting the public, and effectively providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training and medical care. See <i>id.,</i> at 260, 125 S.Ct. 738 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV)).</p>\n<p>It is significant that <i>Booker,</i> while rendering the Guidelines advisory, did not reinstitute the pre-Guidelines federal sentencing system, under which \"well-established doctrine bar[red] review of the exercise of sentencing discretion\" within the broad sentencing ranges imposed by the criminal statutes. <i>Dorszynski v. United States,</i> 418 U.S. 424, 443, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 41 L.Ed.2d 855 (1974). Rather, <i>Booker</i> conditioned a district court's sentencing discretion on appellate review for \"reasonableness\" in light of the Guidelines and the § 3553(a) factors. See <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738 (\"Section 3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing. Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable\").</p>\n<p>Although the <i>Booker</i> Court did not spell out in detail how sentencing judges are to proceed under the new advisory Guidelines regime, it seems clear that this regime permitsand, indeed, requiressentencing judges to make factual findings and to base their sentences on those findings. The federal criminal statutes generally set out wide sentencing ranges, and thus in each case a sentencing judge must use some criteria in selecting the sentence to be imposed. In doing this, federal judges have generally made and relied upon factual determinations about the nature of the offense and the offenderand it is impossible to imagine how federal judges could reasonably carry out their sentencing responsibilities without making such factual determinations.</p>\n<p>Under the mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines regime, these factual determinations were relatively formal and precise. (For example, a trial judge under that regime might have found based on a post-trial proceeding that a drug offense involved six kilograms of cocaine or that the loss caused by a mail fraud offense was $2.5 million.) By contrast, under the pre-Sentencing Reform Act federal system, the factual determinations were often relatively informal and imprecise. (A trial judge might have concluded from the presentence report that an offense involved \"a large quantity of drugs\" or that a mail fraud scheme caused \"a great loss.\") Under both systems, however, the judges made factual determinations about the nature of the offense and the offender and determined the sentence accordingly. And as the Courts of Appeals have unanimously concluded, the post-<i>Booker</i> federal sentencing regime also permits trial judges to make such factual findings and to rely on those findings in selecting the sentences that are appropriate in particular cases.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*876</span> Under the post-<i>Booker</i> system, if a defendant believes that his or her sentence was based on an erroneous factual determination, it seems clear that the defendant may challenge that finding on appeal. As noted, the post-<i>Booker</i> system permits a defendant to obtain appellate review of the reasonableness of a sentence, and a sentence that the sentencing court justifies solely on the basis of an erroneous finding of fact can hardly be regarded as reasonable. Thus, under the post-<i>Booker</i> system, there will be casesand, in all likelihood, a good many casesin which the question whether a defendant will be required to serve a greater or lesser sentence depends on whether a court of appeals sustains a finding of fact made by the sentencing judge.</p>\n<p>A simple example illustrates this point. Suppose that a defendant is found guilty of 10 counts of mail fraud in that the defendant made 10 mailings in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. See 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (2000 ed., Supp. IV). Under the mail fraud statute, the district court would have discretion to sentence the defendant to any sentence ranging from probation up to 50 years of imprisonment (5 years on each count). Suppose that the sentencing judge imposes the maximum sentence allowed by statute50 years of imprisonmentwithout identifying a single fact about the offense or the offender as a justification for this lengthy sentence. Surely that would be an unreasonable sentence that could not be sustained on appeal.</p>\n<p>Suppose, alternatively, that the sentencing court finds that the mail fraud scheme caused a loss of $1 million and that the victims were elderly people of limited means, and suppose that the court, based on these findings, imposes a sentence of 10 years of imprisonment. If the defendant challenges the sentence on appeal on the ground that these findings are erroneous, the question whether the defendant will be required to serve 10 years or some lesser sentence may well depend on the validity of the district court's findings of fact.</p>\n<p><i>Booker,</i> then, approved a sentencing system that (1) requires a sentencing judge to \"consult\" and \"take into account\" legislatively defined sentencing factors and guidelines; (2) subjects a sentencing judge's exercise of sentencing discretion to appellate review for \"reasonableness\"; and (3) requires sentencing judges to make factual findings in order to support the exercise of this discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The California sentencing law that the Court strikes down today is not meaningfully different from the federal scheme upheld in <i>Booker.</i></p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the California law gives a judge at least as much sentencing discretion as does the post-<i>Booker</i> federal scheme. California's system of sentencing triads and separate \"enhancements\"<sup>[5]</sup> was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*877</span> enacted to achieve sentences \"in proportion to the seriousness of the offense as determined by the Legislature to be imposed by the court with specified discretion.\" Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 1170(a)(1) (West Supp.2006). This \"specified discretion\" is quite broad. Under the statute, a sentencing court \"shall order imposition of the middle term\" of the base-term triad, \"unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.\" § 1170(b). While the court may not rely on any fact that is an essential element of the crime or of a proven enhancement, the \"sentencing judge retains considerable discretion to identify aggravating factors.\" <i>People v. Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th 1238, 1247, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d 534, 538 (2005).</p>\n<p>In exercising its sentencing discretion, a California court can look to any of the 16 specific aggravating circumstances, see Cal. Rule of Court (Criminal Cases) 4.421 (West 2006), or 15 specific mitigating circumstances, see Rule 4.423, itemized in the California Rules of Court. A California trial court can also consider the \"[g]eneral objectives of sentencing,\" including protecting society, punishing the defendant, encouraging the defendant to lead a law-abiding life and deterring the defendant from committing future offenses, deterring others from criminal conduct by demonstrating its consequences, preventing the defendant from committing new crimes by means of incarceration, securing restitution for crime victims, and achieving uniformity in sentencing.<sup>[6]</sup> Rule 4.410(a). And if a California trial court finds that its sentencing authority is unduly restricted by these factors, which the California Supreme Court has recognized \"are largely the articulation of considerations sentencing judges have always used in making these decisions,\" <i>People v. Hernandez,</i> 46 Cal.3d 194, 205, 249 Cal.Rptr. 850, 757 P.2d 1013, 1019, (1988) (in bank), overruled on other grounds, <i>People v. King,</i> 5 Cal.4th 59, 78, n. 5, 19 Cal.Rptr.2d 233, 851 P.2d 27, 39, n. 5 (1993) (in banc), a California sentencing judge is also authorized to consider any \"additional criteria reasonably related to the decision being made.\" Rule 4.408(a); see also <i>Black, supra,</i> at 1256, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544 (\"The Legislature did not identify all of the particular facts that could justify the upper term\").<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*878</span> In short, under California law, the \"`circumstances' the sentencing judge may look to in aggravation or in mitigation of the crime include ... `practically everything which has a legitimate bearing' on the matter in issue.\" <i>People v. Guevara,</i> 88 Cal.App.3d 86, 93, 151 Cal.Rptr. 511, 516 (1979); see also Rule 4.410(b) (\"The sentencing judge should be guided by statutory statements of policy, the criteria in these rules, and the facts and circumstances of the case\"). Indeed, as one California court has explained, sentencing discretion may even be guided by a \"judge's subjective determination of ... the appropriate aggregate sentence\" based on his \"experiences with prior cases and the record in the defendant's case.\" <i>People v. Stevens,</i> 205 Cal.App.3d 1452, 1457, 253 Cal.Rptr. 173, 177 (1988). \"A judge's subjective belief regarding the length of the sentence to be imposed is not improper as long as it is channeled by the guided discretion outlined in the myriad of statutory sentencing criteria.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The California schemelike the federal \"advisory Guidelines\"does require that this discretion be exercised <i>reasonably.</i> Indeed, the California Supreme Court, authoritatively construing the California statute,<sup>[8]</sup> has explained that § 1170(b)'s \"requirement that an aggravating factor exist is merely a requirement that the decision to impose the upper term be <i>reasonable.</i>\" <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1255, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544 (emphasis in original); see also <i>id.,</i> at 1257-1258, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 545 (\"The jury's verdict of guilty on an offense authorizes the judge to sentence a defendant to any of the three terms specified by statute as the potential punishments for that offense, as long as the judge exercises his or her discretion in a reasonable manner that is consistent with the requirements and guidelines contained in statutes and court rules\"). Even when a court imposes the \"presumptive\" middle term, its decision is reviewable for abuse of discretionthat is, its decision to sentence at the \"standard\" term must be reasonable. See <i>People v. Cattaneo,</i> 217 Cal.App.3d 1577, 1587-1588, 266 Cal.Rptr. 710, 716 (1990).</p>\n<p>Moreover, the California system, like the post-<i>Booker</i> federal regime, recognizes that a sentencing judge must have the ability to look at <i>all</i> the relevant facts even those outside the trial record and jury verdictin exercising his or her discretion. \"The judicial factfinding that occurs during that selection process is the same type of judicial factfinding that traditionally has been a part of the sentencing process.\" <i>Black, supra,</i> at 1258, 113 P.3d, at 545.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Despite these similarities between the California system and the \"advisory Guidelines\" scheme approved in <i>Booker,</i> the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*879</span> Court nevertheless holds that the California regime runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment. The Court reasons as follows: (1) California requires that some aggravating fact, apart from the elements of the offense found by the jury, must support an upper term sentence; (2) <i>Blakely</i> defined the \"statutory maximum\" to be \"the maximum sentence a judge may impose <i>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant,</i>\" 542 U.S., at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis in original); and therefore (3) the California regime violates \"<i>Apprendi's</i> bright-line rule,\" <i>id.,</i> at 308, 124 S.Ct. 2531, that \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p>This argument is flawed. For one thing, it is not at all clear that a California court must find some case-specific, adjudicative \"fact\" (as opposed to identifying a relevant policy consideration) before imposing an upper term sentence. What a California sentencing court must find is a <i>\"circumstanc[e] in aggravation,\"</i> Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 1170(b) (emphasis added), which, California's Court Rules make clear, can include any \"criteria reasonably related to the decision being made.\" Rule 4.408(a).</p>\n<p>California courts are thus empowered to take into account the full panoply of factual and policy considerations that have traditionally been considered by judges operating under fully discretionary sentencing regimesthe constitutionality of which the Court has repeatedly reaffirmed. California law explicitly authorizes a sentencing court to take into account, for example, broad sentencing objectives like punishment, deterrence, restitution, and uniformity, see Rule 4.410, and even a judge's \"subjective belief\" as to the appropriateness of the sentence, see <i>Stevens, supra,</i> at 1457, 253 Cal.Rptr., at 177, as long as the final result is reasonable.<sup>[9]</sup> Policy considerations like these have always been outside the province of the jury and do not implicate the Sixth Amendment concerns expressed in <i>Apprendi.</i></p>\n<p>In short, the requirement that a California court find some \"circumstanc[e] in aggravation\" before imposing an upper term sentence is not the same as a requirement that it find an aggravating <i>fact.</i> And if a California sentencing court need not find a fact beyond those \"reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant,\" <i>Blakely,</i> supra, at 303 (emphasis deleted), then <i>Apprendi's</i> \"bright-line rule\" plainly does not apply.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>But even if the California law did require that a sentencing court find some <span class=\"star-pagination\">*880</span> aggravating \"fact\" before imposing an upper term sentence, that would not make this case constitutionally distinguishable from <i>Booker.</i> As previously explained, the \"advisory Guidelines,\" bounded by reasonableness review, effectively (albeit less explicitly) impose the same requirement on federal judges. <i>Booker's</i> reasonableness review necessarily supposes that some sentences will be unreasonable in the absence of additional facts justifying them. (Recall the prior hypothetical case in which it was posited that the district court imposed a sentence of 50 years of imprisonment for mail fraud without citing a single aggravating fact about the offense or the offender.) Thus, although the post-<i>Booker</i> Guidelines are labeled \"advisory,\" reasonableness review imposes a very real constraint on a judge's ability to sentence across the full statutory range without finding some aggravating fact.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court downplays the significance of <i>Booker</i> reasonableness review on the ground that <i>Booker</i>-style \"reasonableness... operates <i>within</i> the Sixth Amendment constraints delineated in our precedent, not as a substitute for those constraints.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 870 (emphasis in original). But this begs the question, which concerns the scope of those \"Sixth Amendment constraints.\" That question is answered by the Court's remedial holding in <i>Booker,</i> which necessarily stands for the proposition that it is consistent with the Sixth Amendment for the imposition of an enhanced sentence to be conditioned on a factual finding made by a sentencing judge and not by a jury.</p>\n<p>The Court relies heavily on <i>Blakely's</i> admonition that \"the `statutory maximum' for <i>Apprendi</i> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <i>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.</i>\" 542 U.S., at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis in original). But the Court fails to recognize how this statement must be understood in the wake of <i>Booker.</i></p>\n<p>For each statutory offense, there must be a sentence that represents the least onerous sentence that can be regarded as reasonable in light of the bare statutory elements found by the jury. To return to our prior example of a mail fraud offense, there must be some sentence that represents the least onerous sentence that would be appropriate in a case in which the statutory elements of mail fraud are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*881</span> satisfied but in which the offense and the offender are as little deserving of punishment as can be imagined. (Whether this sentence is the statutory minimum (probation, see 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (2000 ed., Supp. IV)) or the minimum under the advisory Guidelines (also probation, see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 2B1.1 and Sentencing Table (Nov.2006)) is irrelevant for present purposes; what is relevant is that there must be <i>some</i> minimum reasonable sentence.) This sentence is \"the maximum sentence\" that could reasonably be imposed \"solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\" <i>Blakely,</i> supra, at 303 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p><i>Booker's</i> reasonableness review necessarily anticipates that the imposition of sentences above this level may be conditioned upon findings of fact made by a judge and not by the jury. <i>Booker</i> held that a system of \"advisory Guidelines\" with reasonableness review is consistent with the Sixth Amendment, and the same analysis should govern California's \"requirement that the decision to impose the upper term be <i>reasonable.</i>\" <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1255, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544 (emphasis in original). That the California requirement is explicit, while the federal aggravating factor requirement is (at least for now) implicit, should not be constitutionally dispositive.</p>\n<p>Unless the Court is prepared to overrule the remedial decision in <i>Booker,</i> the California sentencing scheme at issue in this case should be held to be consistent with the Sixth Amendment. I would therefore affirm the decision of the California Court of Appeal.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The particular vulnerability of the victim is listed in Cal. Rule of Court 4.421(a)(3) (Criminal Cases) (West 2006) (hereinafter Rule), as a fact \"relating to the crime.\" Violent conduct indicating a serious danger to society is listed in Rule 4.421(b)(1) as a fact \"relating to the defendant.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  In addition to a Sixth Amendment challenge, Cunningham disputed the substance of five of the six findings made by the trial judge. The appellate panel affirmed the trial judge's vulnerable victim and violent conduct findings, but rejected the finding that Cunningham abused a position of trust (because that finding overlapped with the vulnerable victim finding). The panel did not decide whether the judge's other findings were warranted, concluding that he properly relied on at least two aggravating facts in imposing the upper term, and that it was not \"reasonably probable\" that a different sentence would have been imposed absent any improper findings. App. 43-46; <i>id.,</i> at 51 (May 4, 2005, order modifying opinion and denying rehearing).</p>\n<p>[3]  Murder and certain other grave offenses still carry lengthy indeterminate terms with the possibility of early release on parole. Brief for Respondent 7, n. 2. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Penal Code § 190 (West Supp.2006).</p>\n<p>[4]  The Judicial Council includes the chief justice and another justice of the California Supreme Court, three judges sitting on the Courts of Appeal, ten judges from the Superior Courts, and other nonvoting members. Cal. Const., Art. 6, § 6(a) (West Supp.2006). The California Constitution grants the Council authority, <i>inter alia,</i> \"to adopt rules for court administration, practice and procedure, and perform other functions prescribed by statute.\" Art. 6, § 6(d).</p>\n<p>[5]  The Rules were amended on January 1, 2007. Those amendments made technical changes, none of them material to the constitutional question before us. We refer in this opinion to the prior text of the Rules, upon which the parties and principal authorities rely.</p>\n<p>[6]  The judge must provide a statement of reasons for a sentence only when a lower or upper term sentence is imposed. Rules 4.406(b), 4.420(e).</p>\n<p>[7]  <i>E.g.,</i> Rule 4.421(a)(1) (\"[T]he fact that ... [t]he crime involved great violence, great bodily harm, threat of great bodily harm, or other acts disclosing a high degree of cruelty, viciousness, or callousness.\").</p>\n<p>[8]  <i>E.g.,</i> Rule 4.421(b)(1) (\"[T]he fact that ... [t]he defendant has engaged in violent conduct which indicates a serious danger to society.\").</p>\n<p>[9]  See also, <i>e.g.,</i> Rule 4.420(b) (\"Selection of the upper term is justified only if, after a consideration of all the relevant <i>facts,</i> the circumstances in aggravation outweigh the circumstances in mitigation.\" (emphasis added)); Rule 4.420(e) (court must provide \"a concise statement of the ultimate <i>facts</i> that the court deemed to constitute circumstances in aggravation or mitigation\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>[10]  California's DSL, we note in this context, resembles pre-<i>Booker</i> federal sentencing in the same ways Washington's sentencing system did: The key California Penal Code provision states that the sentencing court \"<i>shall order</i> imposition of the middle term\" absent \"circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime,\" § 1170(b) (emphasis added), and any move to the upper or lower term must be justified by \"a concise statement of <i>the ultimate facts</i>\" on which the departure rests, Rule 4.420(e) (emphasis added). But see <i>post,</i> at 876-877 (ALITO, J., dissenting) (characterizing California's DSL as indistinguishable from post-<i>Booker</i> sentencing).</p>\n<p>[11]  Title 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1) mandated the imposition of a Guidelines sentence unless the district court found \"an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.\" Section 3742(e) directed the court of appeals to determine, <i>inter alia,</i> whether the district court correctly applied the Guidelines, § 3742(e)(2), and, if the sentence imposed fell outside the applicable Guidelines range, whether the sentencing judge had provided a written statement of reasons, whether § 3553(b) and the facts of the case warranted the departure, and whether the degree of departure was reasonable, § 3742(e)(3).</p>\n<p>[12]  Section 3553(a) instructs sentencing judges to consider \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" \"the kinds of sentences available,\" and the Guidelines and policy statements issued by the United States Sentencing Commission. § 3553(a)(1), (3)-(5). Avoidance of unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution, are also listed as concerns to which the judge should respond. § 3553(a)(6)-(7).\n</p>\n<p>In a further enumeration, § 3553(a) calls for the imposition of \"a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" to \"reflect the seriousness of the offense,\" \"promote respect for the law,\" \"provide just punishment for the offense,\" \"afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" \"protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\" and \"provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\" § 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p>[13]  While this case does not call for elaboration of the reasonableness check on federal sentencing post-<i>Booker,</i> we note that the Court has granted review in two cases raising questions trained on that matter: <i>Claiborne v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (cert. granted, Nov. 3, 2006); and <i>Rita v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 551, 855, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (cert.granted, Nov. 3, 2006). In <i>Claiborne,</i> the Court will consider whether it is consistent with the advisory cast of the Guidelines system post-<i>Booker</i> to require that extraordinary circumstances attend a sentence varying substantially from the Guidelines. <i>Rita</i> includes the question whether is it consistent with <i>Booker</i> to accord a presumption of reasonableness to a within-Guidelines sentence.\n</p>\n<p>In this regard, we note Justice ALITO's view that California's DSL is essentially the same as post-<i>Booker</i> federal sentencing. <i>Post,</i> at 873-878. To maintain that position, his dissent previews, without benefit of briefing or argument, how \"reasonableness review,\" post-<i>Booker,</i> works. <i>Post,</i> at 880-881. It is neither necessary nor proper now to join issue with Justice ALITO on this matter.</p>\n<p>[14]  Justice KENNEDY urges a distinction between facts concerning the offense, where <i>Apprendi</i> would apply, and facts concerning the offender, where it would not. <i>Post,</i> at 872 (dissenting opinion). <i>Apprendi</i> itself, however, leaves no room for the bifurcated approach Justice KENNEDY proposes. See 530 U.S., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (\"<i>[A]ny</i> fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>[15]  Justice ALITO, however, would do just that. His opinion reads the remedial portion of the Court's opinion in <i>Booker</i> to override <i>Blakely,</i> and to render academic the entire first part of <i>Booker</i> itself. <i>Post,</i> at 880-881. There would have been no majority in <i>Booker</i> for the revision of <i>Blakely</i> essayed in his dissent. Grounded in a notion of how federal reasonableness review operates in practice, Justice ALITO \"necessarily anticipates\" a question that will be aired later this Term in <i>Rita</i> and <i>Claiborne.</i> See <i>supra,</i> at 867, n. 13. While we do not forecast the Court's responses in those cases, we affirm the continuing vitality of our prior decisions in point.</p>\n<p>[16]  Respondent and its <i>amici</i> argue that whatever this Court makes of California's sentencing law, the <i>Black</i> court's \"construction\" of that law as consistent with the Sixth Amendment is authoritative. Brief for Respondent 6, 18, 33; Brief for Hawaii et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 17, 29. We disagree. The <i>Black</i> court did not modify California law so as to align it with this Court's Sixth Amendment precedent. See 35 Cal.4th, at 1273, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 555-556 (Kennard, J., concurring and dissenting). Rather, it construed this Court's decisions in an endeavor to render them consistent with California law. The <i>Black</i> court's interpretation of federal constitutional law plainly does not qualify for this Court's deference.</p>\n<p>[17]  States that have so altered their systems are Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington. Alaska Stat. §§ 12.55.155(f), 12.55.125(c) (2004); Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 13-702.01 (West Supp.2006); Kan. Stat. Ann. §§21-4716(b), 21-4718(b) (2005 Supp.); Minn.Stat. § 244.10, subd. 5 (2005 Supp.); N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 15A-1340.16(a1) (Lexis 2005); 2005 Ore. Sess. Laws, ch. 463, §§ 3(1), 4(1); Wash. Rev.Code §§ 9.94A.535, 9.94A.537 (2006). The Colorado Supreme Court has adopted this approach as an interim solution. <i>Lopez v. People,</i> 113 P.3d 713, 716 (Colo.2005) (en banc). See also Stemen &amp; Wilhelm, Finding the Jury: State Legislative Responses to <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 18 Fed. Sentencing Rptr. 7 (Oct.2005) (majority of affected States have retained determinate sentencing systems).</p>\n<p>[18]  See Ind.Code Ann. § 35-50-2-1.3(a) (West 2006); Tenn.Code Ann. § 40-35-210(c) (2005 Supp.).</p>\n<p>[1]  The Court's recognition of this is hardly surprising since, as Judge McConnell has pointed out, \"fully discretionary sentencing... was the system [that was] in place when the Sixth Amendment was adopted\" and that \"prevailed in the federal courts from the Founding until enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 ... without anyone ever suggesting a conflict with the Sixth Amendment.\" McConnell, The <i>Booker</i> Mess, 83 Denver U.L.Rev. 665, 679 (2006). Indeed, the original federal criminal statute enacted by the First Congress set forth indeterminate sentencing ranges for a variety of offenses, leaving the determination of the precise sentence to the judge's discretion. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, § 2, 1 Stat. 112 (crime of misprision of treason punishable by imprisonment not exceeding seven years and fine not exceeding $1,000); § 6, <i>id.,</i> at 113 (crime of misprision of a felony punishable by imprisonment not exceeding three years and fine not exceeding $500); § 15, <i>id.,</i> at 115-116 (crime of falsifying federal records punishable by imprisonment not exceeding seven years, fine not exceeding $5,000, and whipping not exceeding 39 stripes); see generally Little &amp; Chen, The Lost History of <i>Apprendi</i> and the <i>Blakely</i> Petition for Rehearing, 17 Fed. Sentencing Rep. 69 (2004).</p>\n<p>[2]  The four Justices who would have upheld the constitutionality of the mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines system did not, of course, disagree with this basic point. Indeed, they were of the view that \"[h]istory does not support a `right to jury trial' in respect to sentencing facts.\" <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 328, 125 S.Ct. 738 (BREYER, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>[3]  While the dissenters from the remedial portion of the Court's opinion disagreed with Justice BREYER's severability analysis, they did not suggest that the resulting \"advisory Guidelines\" structure was unconstitutional. Rather, they recognizedas Justice STEVENS explained in his portion of the Court's opinionthat \"[i]f the Guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>[4]  Every Court of Appeals to address the issue has held that a district court sentencing post-<i>Booker</i> may rely on facts found by the judge by a preponderance of the evidence. See <i>United States v. Kilby,</i> 443 F.3d 1135, 1141 (C.A.9 2006); <i>United States v. Cooper,</i> 437 F.3d 324, 330 (C.A.3 2006); <i>United States v. Vaughn,</i> 430 F.3d 518, 525-526 (C.A.2 2005); <i>United States v. Morris,</i> 429 F.3d 65, 72 (C.A.4 2005); <i>United States v. Price,</i> 418 F.3d 771, 788 (C.A.7 2005); <i>United States v. Magallanez,</i> 408 F.3d 672, 684-685 (C.A.10 2005); <i>United States v. Pirani,</i> 406 F.3d 543, 551, n. 4 (C.A.8 2005) (en banc); <i>United States v. Yagar,</i> 404 F.3d 967, 972 (C.A.6 2005); <i>United States v. Mares,</i> 402 F.3d 511, 519, and n. 6 (C.A.5 2005); <i>United States v. Duncan,</i> 400 F.3d 1297, 1304-1305 (C.A.11 2005); <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 74 (C.A.1 2005).</p>\n<p>[5]  These enhancements, which add additional years onto the base-triad term selected by the court, see <i>ante,</i> at 863-864, must be pleaded and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. They are not at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>[6]  These factors are similar to the federal sentencing policies set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which directs a court to consider, among other things, the need to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and to protect the public.</p>\n<p>[7]  As the California Supreme Court explained in <i>Black,</i>\n</p>\n<p>\"In adopting the sentencing rules, the Judicial Council considered and rejected proposals that the rules provide an exclusive list of sentencing criteria and that the criteria be assigned specific weights, on the ground that the Legislature intended to give the sentencing judge discretion in selecting among the lower, middle, and upper terms. The report on which the Judicial Council acted in adopting the rules explains that `an exclusive listing would be inconsistent with the statutory mandate to adopt \"rules providing criteria for the consideration of the trial judge\" [§ 1170.3] since this language does not purport to limit the discretion afforded the court in each of the five enumerated sentencing decisions, but calls for criteria which will assist the courts in the exercise of that discretion.' (Judicial Council of Cal., Advisory Com. Rep., Sentencing Rules and Sentencing Reporting System (1977) p. 6.) `Any attempt to impose a weighting system on trial courts ... would be an infringement on the sentencing power of the court.' (<i>Id.,</i> p. 8.) `The substantive law, and section 1170(a)(1), give discretion to the trial court; the rules can guide, but cannot compel, the exercise of that discretion.' (<i>Id.,</i> p. 11.)\" 35 Cal.4th, at 1256, n. 11, 29 Cal. Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544, n. 11.</p>\n<p>[8]  The Court correctly notes that we need not defer to the California Supreme Court's construction of federal law, including its judgment as to whether California law is consistent with our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence. See <i>ante,</i> at 871, n. 16. But the California Supreme Court's exposition of California law is authoritative and binding on this Court. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Mullaney v. Wilbur,</i> 421 U.S. 684, 691, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975) (\"[S]tate courts are the ultimate expositors of state law [and] we are bound by their constructions except in extreme circumstances\"); <i>Wainwright v. Goode,</i> 464 U.S. 78, 84, 104 S.Ct. 378, 78 L.Ed.2d 187 (1983) (per curiam) (\"[T]he views of the State's highest court with respect to state law are binding on the federal courts\"); <i>Ring v. Arizona,</i> 536 U.S. 584, 603, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002) (recognizing the Arizona Supreme Court's construction of Arizona sentencing law as authoritative).</p>\n<p>[9]  The State of California acknowledged in its brief that \"[t]he court can rely on essentially any reason placing the defendant's particular offense outside the mean when selecting\" which term of the triad to impose. Brief for Respondent 32. As California's counsel acknowledged at oral argument, a concern for deterrence in light of an uptick in crime in a particular community, for example, could be a \"circumstance in aggravation\" supporting imposition of an upper term sentence under California law, even though that concern is not based on judge-found, case-specific facts. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32-40.</p>\n<p>[10]  It is true that California's Court Rules also itemize more concrete aggravating circumstances that they label \"[f]acts relating to the crime\" and \"[f]acts relating to the defendant.\" See Cal. Rules of Court (Criminal Cases) 4.421 and 4.423 (West 2006). But these lists are not exhaustive, and they do not impair a court's ability to take into account more general sentencing objectives in deciding whether to sentence a defendant to the upper term. The Rules' provision that \"[c]ircumstances in aggravation and mitigation shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence,\" Rule 4.420(b), is clearly meant to cover the types of crime- and defendant-specific adjudicative facts set forth in the Rules immediately following; there is nothing to suggest that this provision excludes consideration of more general sentencing objectives that are not conducive to such trial-type proof. As the Rules explicitly recognize, these different categories of sentencing considerations are not mutually exclusive. See Rule 4.410(b) (\"The sentencing judge should be guided by statutory statements of policy, the criteria in these rules, and the facts and circumstances of the case\").</p>\n<p>[11]  The Court believes that in order to reach this conclusion, I must \"previe[w] ... how `reasonableness review,' post-<i>Booker,</i> works,\" <i>ante,</i> at 867, n. 13, and perhaps even prejudge this Court's forthcoming decisions in <i>Rita</i> and <i>Claiborne, ante,</i> at 870-871, n. 15. But my point is much more modest. We need not map all the murky contours of the post-<i>Booker</i> landscape in order to conclude that reasonableness review must mean <i>something.</i> If reasonableness review is more than just an empty exercise, there inevitably will be <i>some</i> sentences that, absent any judge-found aggravating fact, will be unreasonable. One need not embrace any presumption of reasonableness or unreasonableness to accept this simple point. If this is the caseand I cannot see how it is not, given the Court's endorsement of reasonableness review in <i>Booker</i> then there is no meaningful Sixth Amendment difference between California's sentencing system and the post-<i>Booker</i> \"advisory Guidelines.\" Under both, a sentencing judge operating under a reasonableness constraint must find facts beyond the jury's verdict in order to justify the imposition of at least some sentences at the high end of the statutory range.</p>\n\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b>127 S.Ct. 856 (2007)</b></center>\n<center><h1>John CUNNINGHAM, Petitioner,<br>\nv.<br>\nCALIFORNIA.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 05-6551.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued October 11, 2006.</center>\n<center>Decided January 22, 2007.</center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*859</span> Peter Gold, San Francisco, CA, appointed by this court, for petitioner.</p>\n<p>Jeffrey M.

The facts so found are neither inherent in the jury's verdict nor embraced by the defendant's plea, and they need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt. The question presented is whether the DSL, by placing sentence-elevating factfinding within the judge's province, violates a defendant's right to trial by jury safeguarded by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p>As this Court's decisions instruct, the Federal Constitution's jury-trial guarantee proscribes a sentencing scheme that allows a judge to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum based on a fact, other than a prior conviction, not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. <i>Apprendi v.

In petitioner's case, the jury's verdict alone limited the permissible sentence to 12 years. Additional factfinding by the trial judge, however, yielded an upper term sentence of 16 years. The California Court of Appeal affirmed the harsher sentence. We reverse that disposition because the four-year elevation based on judicial factfinding denied petitioner his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Petitioner John Cunningham was tried and convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14. Under the DSL, that offense is punishable by imprisonment for a lower term sentence of 6 years, a middle term sentence of 12 years, or an upper term sentence of 16 years. Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 288.5(a) (West 1999) (hereinafter Penal Code). As further explained below, see <i>infra,</i> at 861-863, the DSL obliged the trial judge to sentence Cunningham to the 12-year middle term unless the judge found one or more additional facts in aggravation. Based on a post-trial sentencing hearing, the trial judge found by a preponderance of the evidence six aggravating circumstances, among them, the particular vulnerability of Cunningham's victim, and Cunningham's violent conduct, which indicated a serious danger to the community. Tr. of Sentencing (Aug. 1, 2003), App. 22.<sup>[1]</sup> In mitigation, the judge found one fact: Cunningham had no record of prior criminal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*861</span> conduct. <i>Ibid.</i> Concluding that the aggravators outweighed the sole mitigator, the judge sentenced Cunningham to the upper term of 16 years. <i>Id.,</i> at 23.</p>\n<p>A panel of the California Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction and sentence; one judge dissented in part, urging that this Court's precedent precluded the judge-determined four-year increase in Cunningham's sentence.

L.J. 5, 6-22 (1978) (hereinafter Cassou &amp; Taugher). Under the prior regime, courts imposed open-ended prison terms (often one year to life), and the parole boardthe Adult Authoritydetermined the amount of time a felon would ultimately spend in prison. <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1246, 1256, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 537, 544; <i>In re Roberts,</i> 36 Cal.4th 575, 588, n. 6, 31 Cal.Rptr.3d 458, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576220\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576220/in-re-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></a></span>, 1129, n. 6 (2005); Cassou &amp; Taugher 5-9. In contrast, the DSL fixed the terms of imprisonment for most offenses, and eliminated the possibility of early release on parole. See Penal Code § 3000 <i>et seq.</i> (West Supp.2006); 3 B. Witkin &amp; N. Epstein, California Criminal Law § 610, p. 809 (3d ed.2000); Brief for Respondent 7.<sup>[3]</sup> Through the DSL, California's lawmakers aimed to promote uniform and proportionate punishment. Penal Code § 1170(a)(1); <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1246, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 537.</p>\n<p>For most offenses, including Cunningham's, the DSL regime is implemented in the following manner. The statute defining the offense prescribes three precise terms of imprisonmenta lower, middle, and upper term sentence. <i>E.g.,</i> Penal Code § 288.5(a) (West 1999) (a person convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child \"shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of 6, 12, or 16 years\"). See also <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1247, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 538. Penal Code § 1170(b) (West Supp.2006) controls the trial judge's choice; it provides that \"the court shall order imposition of the middle term, unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.\" \"[C]ircumstances in aggravation or mitigation\" are to be determined by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*862</span> the court after consideration of several items: the trial record; the probation officer's report; statements in aggravation or mitigation submitted by the parties, the victim, or the victim's family; \"and any further evidence introduced at the sentencing hearing.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The DSL directed the State's Judicial Council<sup>[4]</sup> to adopt Rules guiding the sentencing judge's decision whether to \"[i]mpose the lower or upper prison term.\" Penal Code § 1170.3(a)(2) (West 2004).<sup>[5]</sup> Restating § 1170(b), the Council's Rules provide that \"[t]he middle term shall be selected unless imposition of the upper or lower term is justified by circumstances in aggravation or mitigation.\" Rule 4.420(a). \"Circumstances in aggravation,\" as crisply defined by the Judicial Council, means \"<i>facts</i> which justify the imposition of the upper prison term.\" Rule 4.405(d) (emphasis added). Facts aggravating an offense, the Rules instruct, \"shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence,\" Rule 4.420(b),<sup>[6]</sup> and must be \"stated orally on the record.\" Rule 4.420(e).</p>\n<p>The Rules provide a nonexhaustive list of aggravating circumstances, including \"[f]acts relating to the crime,\" Rule 4.421(a),<sup>[7]</sup> \"[f]acts relating to the defendant,\" Rule 4.421(b),<sup>[8]</sup> and \"[a]ny other facts statutorily declared to be circumstances in aggravation,\" Rule 4.421(c). Beyond the enumerated circumstances, \"the judge is free to consider any `additional criteria reasonably related to the decision being made.'\" <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1247, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 538 (quoting Rule 4.408(a)). \"A fact that is an element of the crime,\" however, \"shall not be used to impose the upper term.\" Rule 4.420(d). In sum, California's DSL, and the rules governing its application, direct the sentencing court to start with the middle term, and to move from that term only when the court itself finds and places on the record factswhether related to the offense or the offenderbeyond the elements of the charged offense.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO maintains, however, that a circumstance in aggravation need not be a fact at all. In his view, a policy judgment, or even a judge's \"subjective belief\" regarding the appropriate sentence, qualifies as an aggravating circumstance. <i>Post,</i> at 879-880 (dissenting opinion). California's Rules, however, constantly refer to \"facts.\" As just noted, the Rules define \"circumstances in aggravation\" as \"<i>facts</i> which justify the imposition of the upper <span class=\"star-pagination\">*863</span> prison term.\" Rule 4.405(d) (emphasis added).<sup>[9]</sup> And \"circumstances in aggravation,\" the Rules unambiguously declare, \"shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence,\" Rule 4.420(b), a clear factfinding directive to which there is no exception. See <i>People v. Hall,</i> 8 Cal.4th 950, 957, 35 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1388919\"><a href=\"/opinion/1388919/people-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span>, 978 (1994) (\"Selection of the upper term is justified <i>only</i> if circumstances in aggravation are established by a preponderance of evidence ....\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>While the Rules list \"[g]eneral objectives of sentencing,\" Rule 4.410(a), nowhere are these objectives cast as \"circumstances in aggravation\" that alone authorize an upper term sentence. The Rules also state that \"[t]he enumeration ... of some criteria for the making of discretionary sentencing decisions does not prohibit the application of additional criteria reasonably related to the decision being made.\" Rule 4.408(a). California courts have not read this language to unmoor \"circumstances in aggravation\" from any factfinding anchor.</p>\n<p>In line with the Rules, the California Supreme Court has repeatedly referred to circumstances in aggravation as facts. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1256, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544 (\"The Legislature did not identify all of the particular <i>facts</i> that could justify the upper term.\" (emphasis added)); <i>People v. Wiley,</i> 9 Cal.4th 580, 587, 38 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1436452\"><a href=\"/opinion/1436452/people-v-wiley/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span>, 545 (1995) (\"[T]rial courts are assigned the task of deciding whether to impose an upper or lower term of imprisonment based upon their determination whether there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime, <i>a determination that invariably requires numerous factual findings.</i>\" (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>It is unsurprising, then, that State's counsel, at oral argument, acknowledged that he knew of no case in which a California trial judge had gone beyond the middle term based not on any fact the judge found, but solely on the basis of a policy judgment or subjective belief. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 49-50.</p>\n<p>Notably, the Penal Code permits elevation of a sentence above the upper term based on specified statutory enhancements relating to the defendant's criminal history or circumstances of the crime. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Penal Code § 667 <i>et seq.</i> (West Supp. 2006); § 12022 <i>et seq.</i> See also <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1257, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 545. Unlike aggravating circumstances, statutory enhancements must be charged in the indictment, and the underlying facts must be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Penal Code § 1170.1(e); <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1257, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 545. A fact underlying an enhancement cannot do double duty; it cannot be used to impose an upper term sentence and, on top of that, an enhanced term. Penal Code § 1170(b). Where permitted by statute, however, a judge may use a fact qualifying as an enhancer to impose an upper term rather than an enhanced sentence. <i>Ibid.;</i> Rule 4.420(c).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This Court has repeatedly held that, under the Sixth Amendment, any fact that exposes a defendant to a greater potential sentence must be found by a jury, not a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*864</span> judge, and established beyond a reasonable doubt, not merely by a preponderance of the evidence. While this rule is rooted in longstanding common-law practice, its explicit statement in our decisions is recent. In <i>Jones v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), we examined the Sixth Amendment's historical and doctrinal foundations, and recognized that judicial factfinding operating to increase a defendant's otherwise maximum punishment posed a grave constitutional question. <i>Id.,</i> at 239-252, 119 S.Ct. 1215. While the Court construed the statute at issue to avoid the question, the <i>Jones</i> opinion presaged our decision, some 15 months later, in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p>Charles Apprendi was convicted of possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose, a second-degree offense under New Jersey law punishable by five to ten years' imprisonment. <i>Id.,</i> at 468, 120 S.Ct. 2348. A separate \"hate crime\" statute authorized an \"extended term\" of imprisonment: Ten to twenty years could be imposed if the trial judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \"`[t]he defendant in committing the crime acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 468-469, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (quoting N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:44-3(e) (West Supp.1999-2000)). The judge in Apprendi's case so found, and therefore sentenced the defendant to 12 years' imprisonment. This Court held that the Sixth Amendment proscribed the enhanced sentence. 530 U.S., at 471, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Other than a prior conviction, see <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 239-247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), we held in <i>Apprendi,</i> \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.

While the overall statutory maximum for a class B felony was ten years, the State's Sentencing Reform Act (Reform Act) added an important qualification: If no facts beyond those reflected in the jury's verdict were found by the trial judge, a defendant could not receive a sentence above a \"standard range\" of 49 to 53 months. <i>Id.,</i> at 299-300, 124 S.Ct. 2531. The Reform Act permitted but did not require a judge to exceed that standard range if she found \"`substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*865</span> sentence.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 9.94A.120(2) (2000)). The Reform Act set out a nonexhaustive list of aggravating facts on which such a sentence elevation could be based. It also clarified that a fact taken into account in fixing the standard range<i>i.e.,</i> any fact found by the jurycould under no circumstances count in the determination whether to impose an exceptional sentence. 542 U.S., at 299-300, 124 S.Ct. 2531. Blakely was sentenced to 90 months' imprisonment, more than three years above the standard range, based on the trial judge's finding that he had acted with deliberate cruelty. <i>Id.,</i> at 300, 124 S.Ct. 2531.</p>\n<p>Applying the rule of <i>Apprendi,</i> this Court held Blakely's sentence unconstitutional. The State in <i>Blakely</i> had endeavored to distinguish <i>Apprendi</i> on the ground that \"[u]nder the Washington guidelines, an exceptional sentence is within the court's discretion as a result of a guilty verdict.\" Brief for Respondent in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> O.T.2003, No. 02-1632, p. 15. We rejected that argument. The judge could not have sentenced Blakely above the standard range without finding the additional fact of deliberate cruelty. Consequently, that fact was subject to the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee. 542 U.S., at 304-314, 124 S.Ct. 2531. It did not matter, we explained, that Blakely's sentence, though outside the standard range, was within the 10-year maximum for class B felonies:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Our precedents make clear ... that the `statutory maximum' for <i>Apprendi</i> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <i>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant</i> .... In other words, the relevant `statutory maximum' is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <i>without</i> any additional findings. When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury's verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts `which the law makes essential to the punishment,' ... and the judge exceeds his proper authority.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis in original) (quoting 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure § 87, p. 55 (2d ed. 1872)).</blockquote>\n<p>Because the judge in Blakely's case could not have imposed a sentence outside the standard range without finding an additional fact, the top of that range53 months, and not 10 yearswas the relevant statutory maximum. 542 U.S., at 304, 124 S.Ct. 2531.</p>\n<p>The State had additionally argued in <i>Blakely</i> that <i>Apprendi's</i> rule was satisfied because Washington's Reform Act did not specify an exclusive catalog of potential facts on which a judge might base a departure from the standard range. This Court rejected that argument as well. \"Whether the judge's authority to impose an enhanced sentence depends on finding a specified fact ... one of several specified facts ... or <i>any</i> aggravating fact (as here),\" we observed, \"it remains the case that the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.\" 542 U.S., at 305, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis in original). Further, we held it irrelevant that the Reform Act ultimately left the decision whether or not to depart to the judge's discretion: \"Whether the judicially determined facts <i>require</i> a sentence enhancement or merely <i>allow</i> it,\" we noted, \"the verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.\" <i>Ibid.,</i> n. 8 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>Freddie Booker was convicted of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and was sentenced under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The facts found by Booker's jury yielded a base Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months' imprisonment, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*866</span> a range the judge could not exceed without undertaking additional factfinding. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 227, 233-234, 125 S.Ct. 738. The judge did so, finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Booker possessed an amount of drugs in excess of the amount determined by the jury's verdict. That finding boosted Booker into a higher Guidelines range. Booker was sentenced at the bottom of the higher range, to 360 months in prison. <i>Id.,</i> at 227, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>In an opinion written by Justice STEVENS for a five-Member majority, the Court held Booker's sentence impermissible under the Sixth Amendment. In the majority's judgment, there was \"no distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue in <i>[Blakely].</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738. Both systems were \"mandatory and impose[d] binding requirements on all sentencing judges.\" <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[10]</sup> Justice STEVENS' opinion for the Court, it bears emphasis, next expressed a view on which there was no disagreement among the Justices. He acknowledged that the Federal Guidelines would not implicate the Sixth Amendment were they advisory:</p>\n<blockquote>\"If the Guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment. We have never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range. Indeed, everyone agrees that the constitutional issues presented by [this case] would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the [federal Sentencing Reform Act] the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges.... For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The Guidelines as written, however, are not advisory; they are mandatory and binding on all judges.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>In an opinion written by Justice BREYER, also garnering a five-Member majority, the Court faced the remedial question, which turned on an assessment of legislative intent: What alteration would Congress have intended had it known that the Guidelines were vulnerable to a Sixth Amendment challenge? Three choices were apparent: the Court could invalidate in its entirety the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984(SRA), the law comprehensively delineating the federal sentencing system; or it could preserve the SRA, and the mandatory Guidelines regime the SRA established, by attaching a jury-trial requirement to any fact increasing a defendant's base Guidelines range; finally, the Court could render the Guidelines advisory by severing two provisions of the SRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1) and 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). 543 U.S., at 246-249, 125 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*867</span> S.Ct. 738.<sup>[11]</sup> Recognizing that \"reasonable minds can, and do, differ\" on the remedial question, the majority concluded that the advisory Guidelines solution came closest to the congressional mark. <i>Id.,</i> at 248-258, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>Under the system described in Justice BREYER's opinion for the Court in <i>Booker,</i> judges would no longer be tied to the sentencing range indicated in the Guidelines. But they would be obliged to \"take account of\" that range along with the sentencing goals Congress enumerated in the SRA at 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). 543 U.S., at 259, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738.<sup>[12]</sup> Having severed § 3742(e), the provision of the SRA governing appellate review of sentences under the mandatory Guidelines scheme, see <i>supra,</i> at 867, and n. 11, the Court installed, as consistent with the Act and the sound administration of justice, a \"reasonableness\" standard of review. 543 U.S., at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738. Without attempting an elaborate discussion of that standard, Justice BREYER's remedial opinion for the Court observed: \"Section 3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing. Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is reasonable.\" <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[13]</sup> The Court emphasized the provisional character of the <i>Booker</i> remedy. Recognizing that authority <span class=\"star-pagination\">*868</span> to speak \"the last word\" resides in Congress, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The ball now lies in Congress' court. The National Legislature is equipped to devise and install, long term, the sentencing system, compatible with the Constitution, that Congress judges best for the federal system of justice.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 265, 125 S.Ct. 738.</blockquote>\n<p>We turn now to the instant case in light of both parts of the Court's <i>Booker</i> opinion, and our earlier decisions in point.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Under California's DSL, an upper term sentence may be imposed only when the trial judge finds an aggravating circumstance. See <i>supra,</i> at 861-862. An element of the charged offense, essential to a jury's determination of guilt, or admitted in a defendant's guilty plea, does not qualify as such a circumstance. See <i>supra,</i> at 862-863. Instead, aggravating circumstances depend on facts found discretely and solely by the judge. In accord with <i>Blakely,</i> therefore, the middle term prescribed in California's statutes, not the upper term, is the relevant statutory maximum. 542 U.S., at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (\"[T]he `statutory maximum' for <i>Apprendi</i> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <i>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.</i>\" (emphasis in original)). Because circumstances in aggravation are found by the judge, not the jury, and need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt, see <i>supra,</i> at 862, the DSL violates <i>Apprendi's</i> bright-line rule: Except for a prior conviction, \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p>While \"[t]hat should be the end of the matter,\" <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 313, 124 S.Ct. 2531, in <i>People v. Black</i><i>,</i> the California Supreme Court held otherwise. In that court's view, the DSL survived examination under our precedent intact. See 35 Cal.4th, at 1254-1261, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 543-548. The <i>Black</i> court acknowledged that California's system appears on surface inspection to be in tension with the rule of <i>Apprendi.</i> But in \"operation and effect,\" the court said, the DSL \"simply authorize[s] a sentencing court to engage in the type of factfinding that traditionally has been incident to the judge's selection of an appropriate sentence within a statutorily prescribed sentencing range.\" 35 Cal.4th, at 1254, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 543. Therefore, the court concluded, \"the upper term is the `statutory maximum' and a trial court's imposition of an upper term sentence does not violate a defendant's right to a jury trial under the principles set forth in <i>Apprendi, Blakely,</i> and <i>Booker.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> But see <i>id.,</i> at 1270, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2570337\"><a href=\"/opinion/2570337/people-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span>, 29 Cal. Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 554 (Kennard, J., concurring and dissenting) (\"Nothing in the high court's majority opinions in <i>Apprendi, Blakely,</i> and <i>Booker</i> suggests that the constitutionality of a state's sentencing scheme turns on whether, in the words of the majority here, it involves the type of factfinding `that traditionally has been performed by a judge.'\" (quoting <i>id.,</i> at 1253, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2570337\"><a href=\"/opinion/2570337/people-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span>, 29 Cal. Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 542)).</p>\n<p>The <i>Black</i> court's conclusion that the upper term, and not the middle term, qualifies as the relevant statutory maximum, rested on several considerations. First, the court reasoned that, given the ample discretion afforded trial judges to identify aggravating facts warranting an upper term sentence, the DSL</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*869</span> \"does not represent a legislative effort to shift the proof of particular facts from elements of a crime (to be proved to a jury) to sentencing factors (to be decided by a judge).... Instead, it afforded the sentencing judge the discretion to decide, with the guidance of rules and statutes, whether the facts of the case and the history of the defendant justify the higher sentence. Such a system does not diminish the traditional power of the jury.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1256, 29 Cal. Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>We cautioned in <i>Blakely,</i> however, that broad discretion to decide what facts may support an enhanced sentence, or to determine whether an enhanced sentence is warranted in any particular case, does not shield a sentencing system from the force of our decisions. If the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence, if, instead, the judge must find an additional fact to impose the longer term, the Sixth Amendment requirement is not satisfied. <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 305, and n. 8, 124 S.Ct. 2531.</p>\n<p>The <i>Black</i> court also urged that the DSL is not cause for concern because it reduced the penalties for most crimes over the prior indeterminate sentencing regime. 35 Cal.4th, at 1256-1258, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544-545. But see <i>id.,</i> at 1271-1272, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 555 (Kennard, J., concurring and dissenting) (\"This aspect of our sentencing law does not differ significantly from the Washington sentencing scheme [the high court invalidated in <i>Blakely.</i>]\"); <i>supra,</i> at 865. Furthermore, California's system is not unfair to defendants, for they \"cannot reasonably expect a guarantee that the upper term will not be imposed\" given judges' broad discretion to impose an upper term sentence or to keep their punishment at the middle term. 35 Cal.4th, at 1258-1259, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 545-546. The <i>Black</i> court additionally noted that the DSL requires statutory enhancements (as distinguished from aggravators)<i>e.g.,</i> the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon, infliction of great bodily injury, Penal Code §§ 12022, 12022.7-.8 (West 2000 and Supp.2006)to be charged in the indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 35 Cal.4th, at 1257, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 545.</p>\n<p>The <i>Black</i> court's examination of the DSL, in short, satisfied it that California's sentencing system does not implicate significantly the concerns underlying the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee. Our decisions, however, leave no room for such an examination. Asking whether a defendant's basic jury-trial right is preserved, though some facts essential to punishment are reserved for determination by the judge, we have said, is the <i>very</i> inquiry <i>Apprendi's</i> \"bright-line rule\" was designed to exclude. See <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 307-308, 124 S.Ct. 2531. But see <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1260, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 547 (stating, remarkably, that \"[t]he high court precedents do not draw a bright line\").<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>Ultimately, the <i>Black</i> court relied on an equation of California's DSL system to the post-<i>Booker</i> federal system. \"The level of discretion available to a California judge in selecting which of the three available terms to impose,\" the court said, \"appears <span class=\"star-pagination\">*870</span> comparable to the level of discretion that the high court has chosen to permit federal judges in post-<i>Booker</i> sentencing.\" 35 Cal.4th, at 1261, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 548. The same equation drives Justice ALITO's dissent. See <i>post,</i> at 873 (\"The California sentencing law ... is indistinguishable in any constitutionally significant respect from the advisory Guidelines scheme that the Court approved in <i>[Booker].</i>\").</p>\n<p>The attempted comparison is unavailing. As earlier explained, see <i>supra,</i> at 866-867, this Court in <i>Booker</i> held the Federal Sentencing Guidelines incompatible with the Sixth Amendment because the Guidelines were \"mandatory and imposed binding requirements on all sentencing judges.\" 543 U.S., at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738. \"[M]erely advisory provisions,\" recommending but not requiring \"the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts,\" all Members of the Court agreed, \"would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.\" <i>Ibid.</i> To remedy the constitutional infirmity found in <i>Booker,</i> the Court's majority excised provisions that rendered the system mandatory, leaving the Guidelines in place as advisory only. <i>Id.,</i> at 245-246, 125 S.Ct. 738. See also <i>supra,</i> at 866-867.</p>\n<p>California's DSL does not resemble the advisory system the <i>Booker</i> Court had in view. Under California's system, judges are not free to exercise their \"discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range.\" <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738. California's Legislature has adopted sentencing triads, three fixed sentences with no ranges between them. Cunningham's sentencing judge had no discretion to select a sentence within a range of 6 to 16 years. His instruction was to select 12 years, nothing less and nothing more, unless he found facts allowing the imposition of a sentence of 6 or 16 years. Factfinding to elevate a sentence from 12 to 16 years, our decisions make plain, falls within the province of the jury employing a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, not the bailiwick of a judge determining where the preponderance of the evidence lies.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the <i>Black</i> court attempted to rescue the DSL's judicial factfinding authority by typing it simply a reasonableness constraint, equivalent to the constraint operative in the federal system post-<i>Booker.</i> See 35 Cal.4th, at 1261, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 548 (\"Because an aggravating factor under California law may include any factor that the judge reasonably deems relevant, the [DSL's] requirement that an upper term sentence be imposed only if an aggravating factor exists is comparable to <i>Booker's</i> requirement that a federal judge's sentencing decision not be unreasonable.\"). Reasonableness, however, is not, as the <i>Black</i> court would have it, the touchstone of Sixth Amendment analysis. The reasonableness requirement <i>Booker</i> anticipated for the federal system operates <i>within</i> the Sixth Amendment constraints delineated in our precedent, not as a substitute for those constraints. Because the DSL allocates to judges sole authority to find facts permitting the imposition of an upper term sentence, the system violates the Sixth Amendment. It is comforting, but beside the point, that California's system requires judge-determined DSL sentences to be reasonable. <i>Booker's</i> remedy for the Federal Guidelines, in short, is not a recipe for rendering our Sixth Amendment case law toothless.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*871</span> To summarize: Contrary to the <i>Black</i> court's holding, our decisions from <i>Apprendi</i> to <i>Booker</i> point to the middle term specified in California's statutes, not the upper term, as the relevant statutory maximum. Because the DSL authorizes the judge, not the jury, to find the facts permitting an upper term sentence, the system cannot withstand measurement against our Sixth Amendment precedent.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>As to the adjustment of California's sentencing system in light of our decision, \"[t]he ball ... lies in [California's] court.\" <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 265, 125 S.Ct. 738; cf. <i>supra,</i> at 868. We note that several States have modified their systems in the wake of <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Blakely</i> to retain determinate sentencing. They have done so by calling upon the juryeither at trial or in a separate sentencing proceedingto find any fact necessary to the imposition of an elevated sentence.<sup>[17]</sup> As earlier noted, California already employs juries in this manner to determine statutory sentencing enhancements. See <i>supra,</i> at 863, 869. Other States have chosen to permit judges genuinely \"to exercise broad discretion ... within a statutory range,\"<sup>[18]</sup> which, \"everyone agrees,\" encounters no Sixth Amendment shoal. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738. California may follow the paths taken by its sister States or otherwise alter its system, so long as the State observes Sixth Amendment limitations declared in this Court's decisions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the California Court of Appeal is reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*872</span> Justice KENNEDY, with whom Justice BREYER joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The dissenting opinion by Justice ALITO, which I join in full, well explains why the Court continues in a wrong and unfortunate direction in the cases following <i>Apprendi v.

The discussion in his dissenting opinion is fully sufficient to show why, in my respectful view, the Court's analysis and holding are mistaken. It does seem appropriate to add this brief, further comment.</p>\n<p>In my view the <i>Apprendi</i> line of cases remains incorrect. Yet there may be a principled rationale permitting those cases to control within the central sphere of their concern, while reducing the collateral, widespread harm to the criminal justice system and the corrections process now resulting from the Court's wooden, unyielding insistence on expanding the <i>Apprendi</i> doctrine far beyond its necessary boundaries. The Court could distinguish between sentencing enhancements based on the nature of the offense, where the <i>Apprendi</i> principle would apply, and sentencing enhancements based on the nature of the offender, where it would not. California attempted to make this initial distinction. Compare Cal. Rule of Court 4.421(a) (Criminal Cases) (West 2006) (listing aggravating \"[f]acts relating to the crime\"), with Rule 4.421(b) (listing aggravating \"[f]acts relating to the defendant\"). The Court should not foreclose its efforts.</p>\n<p>California, as the Court notes, experimented earlier with an indeterminate sentencing system. <i>Ante,</i> at 858. The State reposed vast power and discretion in a nonjudicial agency to set a release date for convicted felons. That system, it seems, would have been untouched by <i>Apprendi.</i> When the State sought to reform its system, it might have chosen to give its judges the authority to sentence to a maximum but to depart downward for unexplained reasons. That too, by considerable irony, would be untouched by <i>Apprendi.</i> Instead, California sought to use a system based on guided discretion. <i>Apprendi,</i> the Court holds today, forecloses this option.</p>\n<p>As dissenting opinions have suggested before, the Constitution ought not to be interpreted to strike down all aspects of sentencing systems that grant judicial discretion with some legislative direction and control. Judges and legislators must have the capacity to develop consistent standards, standards that individual juries empaneled for only a short time cannot elaborate in any permanent way. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 314, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (opinion of O'Connor, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 326-327, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (explaining that \"[s]entencing guidelines are a prime example of [the] collaborative process\" between courts and legislatures). Judges and sentencing officials have a broad view and long-term commitment to correctional systems. Juries do not. Judicial officers and corrections professionals, under the guidance and control of the legislature, should be encouraged to participate in an ongoing manner to improve the various sentencing schemes in our country.</p>\n<p>This system of guided discretion would be permitted to a large extent if the Court confined the <i>Apprendi</i> rule to sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*873</span> enhancements based on the nature of the offense. These would include, for example, the fact that a weapon was used; violence was employed; a stated amount of drugs or other contraband was involved; or the crime was motivated by the victim's race, gender, or other status protected by statute. Juries could consider these matters without serious disruption because these factors often are part of the statutory definition of an aggravated crime in any event and because the evidence to support these enhancements is likely to be a central part of the prosecution's case.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, judicial determination is appropriate with regard to factors exhibited by the defendant. These would include, for example, prior convictions; cooperation or noncooperation with law enforcement; remorse or the lack of it; or other aspects of the defendant's history bearing upon his background and contribution to the community. This is so even if the relevant facts were to be found by the judge by a preponderance of the evidence. These are facts that should be taken into account at sentencing but have little if any significance for whether the defendant committed the crime. See Berman &amp; Bibas, Making Sentencing Sensible, 4 Ohio St. J.Crim. L. 37, 55-57 (2006).</p>\n<p>The line between offense and offender would not always be clear, but in most instances the nature of the offense is defined in a manner that ensures the problem of categories would not be difficult. <i>Apprendi</i> suffers from a similar line-drawing problem between facts that must be considered by the jury and other considerations that a judge can take into account. The main part of the <i>Apprendi</i> holding could be retained with far less systemic disruption. It is to be regretted that the Court's decision today appears to foreclose consideration of this approach or other reasonable efforts to develop systems of guided discretion within the general constraint that <i>Apprendi</i> imposes.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, with whom Justice KENNEDY and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The California sentencing law that the Court strikes down today is indistinguishable in any constitutionally significant respect from the advisory Guidelines scheme that the Court approved in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"143790\"><a href=\"/opinion/143790/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Both sentencing schemes grant trial judges considerable discretion in sentencing; both subject the exercise of that discretion to appellate review for \"reasonableness\"; and boththe California law explicitly, and the federal scheme implicitlyrequire a sentencing judge to find some factor to justify a sentence above the minimum that could be imposed based solely on the jury's verdict. Because this Court has held unequivocally that the post-<i>Booker</i> federal sentencing system satisfies the requirements of the Sixth Amendment, the same should be true with regard to the California system. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and the cases that have followed in its wake, the Court has held that under certain circumstances a criminal defendant possesses the Sixth Amendment right to have a jury find facts that result in an increased sentence. The Court, however, has never suggested that all factual findings that affect a defendant's sentence must be made by a jury. On the contrary, in <i>Apprendi</i> and later cases, the Court has consistently stated that when a trial court makes a fully discretionary sentencing decision (such as a sentencing decision under the pre-Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*874</span> federal sentencing system), the Sixth Amendment permits the court to base the sentence on its own factual findings. See <i>id.,</i> at 481, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 305, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738; see also <i>Harris v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, 558, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Applying this rule, the <i>Booker</i> Court unanimously agreed that judicial factfinding under a purely advisory guidelines system would likewise comport with the Sixth Amendment. Writing for the five Justices who struck down the mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines system, Justice STEVENS stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"If the Guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment. We have never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range .... For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.\" <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738.<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>In a similar vein, the remedial portion of the Court's opinion in <i>Booker,</i> written by Justice BREYER, held that the Sixth Amendment permits a system of advisory guidelines with reasonableness review.<sup>[3]</sup> Justice BREYER's opinion avoided a blanket invalidation of the Guidelines by excising the provision of the Sentencing Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), that required a sentencing judge to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range. See <i>Booker,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*875</span> 543 U.S., at 259, 125 S.Ct. 738. As Justice BREYER explained, \"the existence of § 3553(b)(1) is a necessary condition of the constitutional violation. That is to say, without this provision ... the statute falls outside the scope of <i>Apprendi's</i> requirement.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Under the post-<i>Booker</i> federal sentencing system, \"[t]he district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. In addition, sentencing courts must take account of the general sentencing goals set forth by Congress, including avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities, providing restitution to victims, reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment, affording adequate deterrence, protecting the public, and effectively providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training and medical care. See <i>id.,</i> at 260, 125 S.Ct. 738 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV)).</p>\n<p>It is significant that <i>Booker,</i> while rendering the Guidelines advisory, did not reinstitute the pre-Guidelines federal sentencing system, under which \"well-established doctrine bar[red] review of the exercise of sentencing discretion\" within the broad sentencing ranges imposed by the criminal statutes. <i>Dorszynski v.

Rather, <i>Booker</i> conditioned a district court's sentencing discretion on appellate review for \"reasonableness\" in light of the Guidelines and the § 3553(a) factors. See <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738 (\"Section 3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing. Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable\").</p>\n<p>Although the <i>Booker</i> Court did not spell out in detail how sentencing judges are to proceed under the new advisory Guidelines regime, it seems clear that this regime permitsand, indeed, requiressentencing judges to make factual findings and to base their sentences on those findings. The federal criminal statutes generally set out wide sentencing ranges, and thus in each case a sentencing judge must use some criteria in selecting the sentence to be imposed. In doing this, federal judges have generally made and relied upon factual determinations about the nature of the offense and the offenderand it is impossible to imagine how federal judges could reasonably carry out their sentencing responsibilities without making such factual determinations.</p>\n<p>Under the mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines regime, these factual determinations were relatively formal and precise. (For example, a trial judge under that regime might have found based on a post-trial proceeding that a drug offense involved six kilograms of cocaine or that the loss caused by a mail fraud offense was $2.5 million.) By contrast, under the pre-Sentencing Reform Act federal system, the factual determinations were often relatively informal and imprecise. (A trial judge might have concluded from the presentence report that an offense involved \"a large quantity of drugs\" or that a mail fraud scheme caused \"a great loss.\") Under both systems, however, the judges made factual determinations about the nature of the offense and the offender and determined the sentence accordingly. And as the Courts of Appeals have unanimously concluded, the post-<i>Booker</i> federal sentencing regime also permits trial judges to make such factual findings and to rely on those findings in selecting the sentences that are appropriate in particular cases.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*876</span> Under the post-<i>Booker</i> system, if a defendant believes that his or her sentence was based on an erroneous factual determination, it seems clear that the defendant may challenge that finding on appeal. As noted, the post-<i>Booker</i> system permits a defendant to obtain appellate review of the reasonableness of a sentence, and a sentence that the sentencing court justifies solely on the basis of an erroneous finding of fact can hardly be regarded as reasonable. Thus, under the post-<i>Booker</i> system, there will be casesand, in all likelihood, a good many casesin which the question whether a defendant will be required to serve a greater or lesser sentence depends on whether a court of appeals sustains a finding of fact made by the sentencing judge.</p>\n<p>A simple example illustrates this point. Suppose that a defendant is found guilty of 10 counts of mail fraud in that the defendant made 10 mailings in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. See 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (2000 ed., Supp. IV). Under the mail fraud statute, the district court would have discretion to sentence the defendant to any sentence ranging from probation up to 50 years of imprisonment (5 years on each count). Suppose that the sentencing judge imposes the maximum sentence allowed by statute50 years of imprisonmentwithout identifying a single fact about the offense or the offender as a justification for this lengthy sentence. Surely that would be an unreasonable sentence that could not be sustained on appeal.</p>\n<p>Suppose, alternatively, that the sentencing court finds that the mail fraud scheme caused a loss of $1 million and that the victims were elderly people of limited means, and suppose that the court, based on these findings, imposes a sentence of 10 years of imprisonment. If the defendant challenges the sentence on appeal on the ground that these findings are erroneous, the question whether the defendant will be required to serve 10 years or some lesser sentence may well depend on the validity of the district court's findings of fact.</p>\n<p><i>Booker,</i> then, approved a sentencing system that (1) requires a sentencing judge to \"consult\" and \"take into account\" legislatively defined sentencing factors and guidelines; (2) subjects a sentencing judge's exercise of sentencing discretion to appellate review for \"reasonableness\"; and (3) requires sentencing judges to make factual findings in order to support the exercise of this discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The California sentencing law that the Court strikes down today is not meaningfully different from the federal scheme upheld in <i>Booker.</i></p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the California law gives a judge at least as much sentencing discretion as does the post-<i>Booker</i> federal scheme. California's system of sentencing triads and separate \"enhancements\"<sup>[5]</sup> was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*877</span> enacted to achieve sentences \"in proportion to the seriousness of the offense as determined by the Legislature to be imposed by the court with specified discretion.\" Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 1170(a)(1) (West Supp.2006). This \"specified discretion\" is quite broad. Under the statute, a sentencing court \"shall order imposition of the middle term\" of the base-term triad, \"unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.\" § 1170(b). While the court may not rely on any fact that is an essential element of the crime or of a proven enhancement, the \"sentencing judge retains considerable discretion to identify aggravating factors.\" <i>People v. Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th 1238, 1247, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2570337\"><a href=\"/opinion/2570337/people-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span>, 538 (2005).</p>\n<p>In exercising its sentencing discretion, a California court can look to any of the 16 specific aggravating circumstances, see Cal. Rule of Court (Criminal Cases) 4.421 (West 2006), or 15 specific mitigating circumstances, see Rule 4.423, itemized in the California Rules of Court. A California trial court can also consider the \"[g]eneral objectives of sentencing,\" including protecting society, punishing the defendant, encouraging the defendant to lead a law-abiding life and deterring the defendant from committing future offenses, deterring others from criminal conduct by demonstrating its consequences, preventing the defendant from committing new crimes by means of incarceration, securing restitution for crime victims, and achieving uniformity in sentencing.<sup>[6]</sup> Rule 4.410(a). And if a California trial court finds that its sentencing authority is unduly restricted by these factors, which the California Supreme Court has recognized \"are largely the articulation of considerations sentencing judges have always used in making these decisions,\" <i>People v.

Guevara,</i> 88 Cal.App.3d 86, 93, 151 Cal.Rptr. 511, 516 (1979); see also Rule 4.410(b) (\"The sentencing judge should be guided by statutory statements of policy, the criteria in these rules, and the facts and circumstances of the case\"). Indeed, as one California court has explained, sentencing discretion may even be guided by a \"judge's subjective determination of ... the appropriate aggregate sentence\" based on his \"experiences with prior cases and the record in the defendant's case.\" <i>People v. Stevens,</i> 205 Cal.App.3d 1452, 1457, 253 Cal.Rptr. 173, 177 (1988). \"A judge's subjective belief regarding the length of the sentence to be imposed is not improper as long as it is channeled by the guided discretion outlined in the myriad of statutory sentencing criteria.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The California schemelike the federal \"advisory Guidelines\"does require that this discretion be exercised <i>reasonably.</i> Indeed, the California Supreme Court, authoritatively construing the California statute,<sup>[8]</sup> has explained that § 1170(b)'s \"requirement that an aggravating factor exist is merely a requirement that the decision to impose the upper term be <i>reasonable.</i>\" <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1255, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544 (emphasis in original); see also <i>id.,</i> at 1257-1258, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 545 (\"The jury's verdict of guilty on an offense authorizes the judge to sentence a defendant to any of the three terms specified by statute as the potential punishments for that offense, as long as the judge exercises his or her discretion in a reasonable manner that is consistent with the requirements and guidelines contained in statutes and court rules\"). Even when a court imposes the \"presumptive\" middle term, its decision is reviewable for abuse of discretionthat is, its decision to sentence at the \"standard\" term must be reasonable. See <i>People v. Cattaneo,</i> 217 Cal.App.3d 1577, 1587-1588, 266 Cal.Rptr. 710, 716 (1990).</p>\n<p>Moreover, the California system, like the post-<i>Booker</i> federal regime, recognizes that a sentencing judge must have the ability to look at <i>all</i> the relevant facts even those outside the trial record and jury verdictin exercising his or her discretion. \"The judicial factfinding that occurs during that selection process is the same type of judicial factfinding that traditionally has been a part of the sentencing process.\" <i>Black, supra,</i> at 1258, 113 P.3d, at 545.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Despite these similarities between the California system and the \"advisory Guidelines\" scheme approved in <i>Booker,</i> the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*879</span> Court nevertheless holds that the California regime runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment. The Court reasons as follows: (1) California requires that some aggravating fact, apart from the elements of the offense found by the jury, must support an upper term sentence; (2) <i>Blakely</i> defined the \"statutory maximum\" to be \"the maximum sentence a judge may impose <i>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant,</i>\" 542 U.S., at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis in original); and therefore (3) the California regime violates \"<i>Apprendi's</i> bright-line rule,\" <i>id.,</i> at 308, 124 S.Ct. 2531, that \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p>This argument is flawed. For one thing, it is not at all clear that a California court must find some case-specific, adjudicative \"fact\" (as opposed to identifying a relevant policy consideration) before imposing an upper term sentence. What a California sentencing court must find is a <i>\"circumstanc[e] in aggravation,\"</i> Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 1170(b) (emphasis added), which, California's Court Rules make clear, can include any \"criteria reasonably related to the decision being made.\" Rule 4.408(a).</p>\n<p>California courts are thus empowered to take into account the full panoply of factual and policy considerations that have traditionally been considered by judges operating under fully discretionary sentencing regimesthe constitutionality of which the Court has repeatedly reaffirmed. California law explicitly authorizes a sentencing court to take into account, for example, broad sentencing objectives like punishment, deterrence, restitution, and uniformity, see Rule 4.410, and even a judge's \"subjective belief\" as to the appropriateness of the sentence, see <i>Stevens, supra,</i> at 1457, 253 Cal.Rptr., at 177, as long as the final result is reasonable.<sup>[9]</sup> Policy considerations like these have always been outside the province of the jury and do not implicate the Sixth Amendment concerns expressed in <i>Apprendi.</i></p>\n<p>In short, the requirement that a California court find some \"circumstanc[e] in aggravation\" before imposing an upper term sentence is not the same as a requirement that it find an aggravating <i>fact.</i> And if a California sentencing court need not find a fact beyond those \"reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant,\" <i>Blakely,</i> supra, at 303 (emphasis deleted), then <i>Apprendi's</i> \"bright-line rule\" plainly does not apply.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>But even if the California law did require that a sentencing court find some <span class=\"star-pagination\">*880</span> aggravating \"fact\" before imposing an upper term sentence, that would not make this case constitutionally distinguishable from <i>Booker.</i> As previously explained, the \"advisory Guidelines,\" bounded by reasonableness review, effectively (albeit less explicitly) impose the same requirement on federal judges. <i>Booker's</i> reasonableness review necessarily supposes that some sentences will be unreasonable in the absence of additional facts justifying them. (Recall the prior hypothetical case in which it was posited that the district court imposed a sentence of 50 years of imprisonment for mail fraud without citing a single aggravating fact about the offense or the offender.) Thus, although the post-<i>Booker</i> Guidelines are labeled \"advisory,\" reasonableness review imposes a very real constraint on a judge's ability to sentence across the full statutory range without finding some aggravating fact.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court downplays the significance of <i>Booker</i> reasonableness review on the ground that <i>Booker</i>-style \"reasonableness... operates <i>within</i> the Sixth Amendment constraints delineated in our precedent, not as a substitute for those constraints.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 870 (emphasis in original). But this begs the question, which concerns the scope of those \"Sixth Amendment constraints.\" That question is answered by the Court's remedial holding in <i>Booker,</i> which necessarily stands for the proposition that it is consistent with the Sixth Amendment for the imposition of an enhanced sentence to be conditioned on a factual finding made by a sentencing judge and not by a jury.</p>\n<p>The Court relies heavily on <i>Blakely's</i> admonition that \"the `statutory maximum' for <i>Apprendi</i> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <i>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.</i>\" 542 U.S., at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis in original). But the Court fails to recognize how this statement must be understood in the wake of <i>Booker.</i></p>\n<p>For each statutory offense, there must be a sentence that represents the least onerous sentence that can be regarded as reasonable in light of the bare statutory elements found by the jury. To return to our prior example of a mail fraud offense, there must be some sentence that represents the least onerous sentence that would be appropriate in a case in which the statutory elements of mail fraud are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*881</span> satisfied but in which the offense and the offender are as little deserving of punishment as can be imagined. (Whether this sentence is the statutory minimum (probation, see 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (2000 ed., Supp. IV)) or the minimum under the advisory Guidelines (also probation, see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 2B1.1 and Sentencing Table (Nov.2006)) is irrelevant for present purposes; what is relevant is that there must be <i>some</i> minimum reasonable sentence.) This sentence is \"the maximum sentence\" that could reasonably be imposed \"solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\" <i>Blakely,</i> supra, at 303 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p><i>Booker's</i> reasonableness review necessarily anticipates that the imposition of sentences above this level may be conditioned upon findings of fact made by a judge and not by the jury. <i>Booker</i> held that a system of \"advisory Guidelines\" with reasonableness review is consistent with the Sixth Amendment, and the same analysis should govern California's \"requirement that the decision to impose the upper term be <i>reasonable.</i>\" <i>Black,</i> 35 Cal.4th, at 1255, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544 (emphasis in original). That the California requirement is explicit, while the federal aggravating factor requirement is (at least for now) implicit, should not be constitutionally dispositive.</p>\n<p>Unless the Court is prepared to overrule the remedial decision in <i>Booker,</i> the California sentencing scheme at issue in this case should be held to be consistent with the Sixth Amendment. I would therefore affirm the decision of the California Court of Appeal.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The particular vulnerability of the victim is listed in Cal. Rule of Court 4.421(a)(3) (Criminal Cases) (West 2006) (hereinafter Rule), as a fact \"relating to the crime.\" Violent conduct indicating a serious danger to society is listed in Rule 4.421(b)(1) as a fact \"relating to the defendant.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  In addition to a Sixth Amendment challenge, Cunningham disputed the substance of five of the six findings made by the trial judge. The appellate panel affirmed the trial judge's vulnerable victim and violent conduct findings, but rejected the finding that Cunningham abused a position of trust (because that finding overlapped with the vulnerable victim finding). The panel did not decide whether the judge's other findings were warranted, concluding that he properly relied on at least two aggravating facts in imposing the upper term, and that it was not \"reasonably probable\" that a different sentence would have been imposed absent any improper findings.

Those amendments made technical changes, none of them material to the constitutional question before us. We refer in this opinion to the prior text of the Rules, upon which the parties and principal authorities rely.</p>\n<p>[6]  The judge must provide a statement of reasons for a sentence only when a lower or upper term sentence is imposed. Rules 4.406(b), 4.420(e).</p>\n<p>[7]  <i>E.g.,</i> Rule 4.421(a)(1) (\"[T]he fact that ... [t]he crime involved great violence, great bodily harm, threat of great bodily harm, or other acts disclosing a high degree of cruelty, viciousness, or callousness.\").</p>\n<p>[8]  <i>E.g.,</i> Rule 4.421(b)(1) (\"[T]he fact that ... [t]he defendant has engaged in violent conduct which indicates a serious danger to society.\").</p>\n<p>[9]  See also, <i>e.g.,</i> Rule 4.420(b) (\"Selection of the upper term is justified only if, after a consideration of all the relevant <i>facts,</i> the circumstances in aggravation outweigh the circumstances in mitigation.\" (emphasis added)); Rule 4.420(e) (court must provide \"a concise statement of the ultimate <i>facts</i> that the court deemed to constitute circumstances in aggravation or mitigation\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>[10]  California's DSL, we note in this context, resembles pre-<i>Booker</i> federal sentencing in the same ways Washington's sentencing system did: The key California Penal Code provision states that the sentencing court \"<i>shall order</i> imposition of the middle term\" absent \"circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime,\" § 1170(b) (emphasis added), and any move to the upper or lower term must be justified by \"a concise statement of <i>the ultimate facts</i>\" on which the departure rests, Rule 4.420(e) (emphasis added). But see <i>post,</i> at 876-877 (ALITO, J., dissenting) (characterizing California's DSL as indistinguishable from post-<i>Booker</i> sentencing).</p>\n<p>[11]  Title 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1) mandated the imposition of a Guidelines sentence unless the district court found \"an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.\" Section 3742(e) directed the court of appeals to determine, <i>inter alia,</i> whether the district court correctly applied the Guidelines, § 3742(e)(2), and, if the sentence imposed fell outside the applicable Guidelines range, whether the sentencing judge had provided a written statement of reasons, whether § 3553(b) and the facts of the case warranted the departure, and whether the degree of departure was reasonable, § 3742(e)(3).</p>\n<p>[12]  Section 3553(a) instructs sentencing judges to consider \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" \"the kinds of sentences available,\" and the Guidelines and policy statements issued by the United States Sentencing Commission. § 3553(a)(1), (3)-(5). Avoidance of unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution, are also listed as concerns to which the judge should respond. § 3553(a)(6)-(7).\n</p>\n<p>In a further enumeration, § 3553(a) calls for the imposition of \"a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" to \"reflect the seriousness of the offense,\" \"promote respect for the law,\" \"provide just punishment for the offense,\" \"afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" \"protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\" and \"provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\" § 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p>[13]  While this case does not call for elaboration of the reasonableness check on federal sentencing post-<i>Booker,</i> we note that the Court has granted review in two cases raising questions trained on that matter: <i>Claiborne v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (cert. granted, Nov. 3, 2006); and <i>Rita v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 551, 855, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (cert.granted, Nov. 3, 2006). In <i>Claiborne,</i> the Court will consider whether it is consistent with the advisory cast of the Guidelines system post-<i>Booker</i> to require that extraordinary circumstances attend a sentence varying substantially from the Guidelines. <i>Rita</i> includes the question whether is it consistent with <i>Booker</i> to accord a presumption of reasonableness to a within-Guidelines sentence.\n</p>\n<p>In this regard, we note Justice ALITO's view that California's DSL is essentially the same as post-<i>Booker</i> federal sentencing. <i>Post,</i> at 873-878. To maintain that position, his dissent previews, without benefit of briefing or argument, how \"reasonableness review,\" post-<i>Booker,</i> works. <i>Post,</i> at 880-881. It is neither necessary nor proper now to join issue with Justice ALITO on this matter.</p>\n<p>[14]  Justice KENNEDY urges a distinction between facts concerning the offense, where <i>Apprendi</i> would apply, and facts concerning the offender, where it would not. <i>Post,</i> at 872 (dissenting opinion). <i>Apprendi</i> itself, however, leaves no room for the bifurcated approach Justice KENNEDY proposes. See 530 U.S., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (\"<i>[A]ny</i> fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>[15]  Justice ALITO, however, would do just that. His opinion reads the remedial portion of the Court's opinion in <i>Booker</i> to override <i>Blakely,</i> and to render academic the entire first part of <i>Booker</i> itself. <i>Post,</i> at 880-881. There would have been no majority in <i>Booker</i> for the revision of <i>Blakely</i> essayed in his dissent. Grounded in a notion of how federal reasonableness review operates in practice, Justice ALITO \"necessarily anticipates\" a question that will be aired later this Term in <i>Rita</i> and <i>Claiborne.</i> See <i>supra,</i> at 867, n. 13. While we do not forecast the Court's responses in those cases, we affirm the continuing vitality of our prior decisions in point.</p>\n<p>[16]  Respondent and its <i>amici</i> argue that whatever this Court makes of California's sentencing law, the <i>Black</i> court's \"construction\" of that law as consistent with the Sixth Amendment is authoritative. Brief for Respondent 6, 18, 33; Brief for Hawaii et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 17, 29. We disagree. The <i>Black</i> court did not modify California law so as to align it with this Court's Sixth Amendment precedent. See 35 Cal.4th, at 1273, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 555-556 (Kennard, J., concurring and dissenting). Rather, it construed this Court's decisions in an endeavor to render them consistent with California law.

Indeed, the original federal criminal statute enacted by the First Congress set forth indeterminate sentencing ranges for a variety of offenses, leaving the determination of the precise sentence to the judge's discretion. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, § 2, 1 Stat. 112 (crime of misprision of treason punishable by imprisonment not exceeding seven years and fine not exceeding $1,000); § 6, <i>id.,</i> at 113 (crime of misprision of a felony punishable by imprisonment not exceeding three years and fine not exceeding $500); § 15, <i>id.,</i> at 115-116 (crime of falsifying federal records punishable by imprisonment not exceeding seven years, fine not exceeding $5,000, and whipping not exceeding 39 stripes); see generally Little &amp; Chen, The Lost History of <i>Apprendi</i> and the <i>Blakely</i> Petition for Rehearing, 17 Fed. Sentencing Rep. 69 (2004).</p>\n<p>[2]  The four Justices who would have upheld the constitutionality of the mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines system did not, of course, disagree with this basic point. Indeed, they were of the view that \"[h]istory does not support a `right to jury trial' in respect to sentencing facts.\" <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 328, 125 S.Ct. 738 (BREYER, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>[3]  While the dissenters from the remedial portion of the Court's opinion disagreed with Justice BREYER's severability analysis, they did not suggest that the resulting \"advisory Guidelines\" structure was unconstitutional. Rather, they recognizedas Justice STEVENS explained in his portion of the Court's opinionthat \"[i]f the Guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>[4]  Every Court of Appeals to address the issue has held that a district court sentencing post-<i>Booker</i> may rely on facts found by the judge by a preponderance of the evidence.

They are not at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>[6]  These factors are similar to the federal sentencing policies set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which directs a court to consider, among other things, the need to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and to protect the public.</p>\n<p>[7]  As the California Supreme Court explained in <i>Black,</i>\n</p>\n<p>\"In adopting the sentencing rules, the Judicial Council considered and rejected proposals that the rules provide an exclusive list of sentencing criteria and that the criteria be assigned specific weights, on the ground that the Legislature intended to give the sentencing judge discretion in selecting among the lower, middle, and upper terms. The report on which the Judicial Council acted in adopting the rules explains that `an exclusive listing would be inconsistent with the statutory mandate to adopt \"rules providing criteria for the consideration of the trial judge\" [§ 1170.3] since this language does not purport to limit the discretion afforded the court in each of the five enumerated sentencing decisions, but calls for criteria which will assist the courts in the exercise of that discretion.' (Judicial Council of Cal., Advisory Com. Rep., Sentencing Rules and Sentencing Reporting System (1977) p. 6.) `Any attempt to impose a weighting system on trial courts ... would be an infringement on the sentencing power of the court.' (<i>Id.,</i> p. 8.) `The substantive law, and section 1170(a)(1), give discretion to the trial court; the rules can guide, but cannot compel, the exercise of that discretion.' (<i>Id.,</i> p. 11.)\" 35 Cal.4th, at 1256, n. 11, 29 Cal. Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, at 544, n. 11.</p>\n<p>[8]  The Court correctly notes that we need not defer to the California Supreme Court's construction of federal law, including its judgment as to whether California law is consistent with our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence. See <i>ante,</i> at 871, n. 16. But the California Supreme Court's exposition of California law is authoritative and binding on this Court. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Mullaney v.

Brief for Respondent 32. As California's counsel acknowledged at oral argument, a concern for deterrence in light of an uptick in crime in a particular community, for example, could be a \"circumstance in aggravation\" supporting imposition of an upper term sentence under California law, even though that concern is not based on judge-found, case-specific facts. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32-40.</p>\n<p>[10]  It is true that California's Court Rules also itemize more concrete aggravating circumstances that they label \"[f]acts relating to the crime\" and \"[f]acts relating to the defendant.\" See Cal. Rules of Court (Criminal Cases) 4.421 and 4.423 (West 2006). But these lists are not exhaustive, and they do not impair a court's ability to take into account more general sentencing objectives in deciding whether to sentence a defendant to the upper term. The Rules' provision that \"[c]ircumstances in aggravation and mitigation shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence,\" Rule 4.420(b), is clearly meant to cover the types of crime- and defendant-specific adjudicative facts set forth in the Rules immediately following; there is nothing to suggest that this provision excludes consideration of more general sentencing objectives that are not conducive to such trial-type proof. As the Rules explicitly recognize, these different categories of sentencing considerations are not mutually exclusive. See Rule 4.410(b) (\"The sentencing judge should be guided by statutory statements of policy, the criteria in these rules, and the facts and circumstances of the case\").</p>\n<p>[11]  The Court believes that in order to reach this conclusion, I must \"previe[w] ... how `reasonableness review,' post-<i>Booker,</i> works,\" <i>ante,</i> at 867, n. 13, and perhaps even prejudge this Court's forthcoming decisions in <i>Rita</i> and <i>Claiborne, ante,</i> at 870-871, n. 15. But my point is much more modest. We need not map all the murky contours of the post-<i>Booker</i> landscape in order to conclude that reasonableness review must mean <i>something.</i> If reasonableness review is more than just an empty exercise, there inevitably will be <i>some</i> sentences that, absent any judge-found aggravating fact, will be unreasonable. One need not embrace any presumption of reasonableness or unreasonableness to accept this simple point. If this is the caseand I cannot see how it is not, given the Court's endorsement of reasonableness review in <i>Booker</i> then there is no meaningful Sixth Amendment difference between California's sentencing system and the post-<i>Booker</i> \"advisory Guidelines.\" Under both, a sentencing judge operating under a reasonableness constraint must find facts beyond the jury's verdict in order to justify the imposition of at least some sentences at the high end of the statutory range.</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 145761, "judges": "Ginsburg", "local_path": "pdf/2007/01/22/Cunningham_v._California.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2006                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

CALIFORNIA\n\n    CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA,\n\n                FIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\n\n  No. 05–6551. Argued October 11, 2006—Decided January 22, 2007\nPetitioner Cunningham was tried and convicted of continuous sexual\n  abuse of a child under 14. Under California’s determinate sentencing\n  law (DSL), that offense is punishable by one of three precise terms of\n  imprisonment: a lower term sentence of 6 years, a middle term sen\n  tence of 12 years, or an upper term sentence of 16 years. The DSL\n  obliged the trial judge to sentence Cunningham to the 12-year middle\n  term unless the judge found one or more additional “circumstances in\n  aggravation.” Court Rules adopted to implement the DSL define “cir\n  cumstances in aggravation” as facts that justify the upper term.\n  Those facts, the Rules provide, must be established by a preponder\n  ance of the evidence. Based on a post-trial sentencing hearing, the\n  judge found by a preponderance of the evidence six aggravating facts,\n  including the particular vulnerability of the victim, and one mitigat\n  ing fact, that Cunningham had no record of prior criminal conduct.\n  Concluding that the aggravators outweighed the sole mitigator, the\n  judge sentenced Cunningham to the upper term of 16 years. The\n  California Court of Appeal affirmed. The State Supreme Court de\n  nied review, but in a decision published nine days earlier, People v.\n  Black, 35 Cal 4th 1230, 113 P. 3d 534, that court held that the DSL\n  survived Sixth Amendment inspection.\nHeld: The DSL, by placing sentence-elevating factfinding within the\n judge’s province, violates a defendant’s right to trial by jury safe\n guarded by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 8–22.\n    (a) In Apprendi v. New Jersey, this Court held that, under the Sixth\n Amendment, any fact (other than a prior conviction) that exposes a\n defendant to a sentence in excess of the relevant statutory maximum\n must be found by a jury, not a judge, and established beyond a rea\n sonable doubt, not merely by a preponderance of the evidence. See\n2                    CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    530 U. S. 466, 490. The Court has applied the rule of Apprendi to\n    facts subjecting a defendant to the death penalty, Ring v. Arizona,\n    536 U. S. 584, 602, 609, facts permitting a sentence in excess of the\n    “standard range” under Washington’s Sentencing Reform Act (Re\n    form Act), Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 304–305, and facts\n    triggering a sentence range elevation under the then-mandatory\n    Federal Sentencing Guidelines, United States v. Booker, 543 U. S.\n    220, 243–244. Blakely and Booker bear most closely on the question\n    presented here.\n       The maximum penalty for Blakely’s offense, under Washington’s\n    Reform Act, was ten years’ imprisonment, but if no facts beyond\n    those reflected in the jury’s verdict were found by the trial judge,\n    Blakely could not receive a sentence above a standard range of 49 to\n    53 months. Blakely was sentenced to 90 months, more than three\n    years above the standard range, based on the judge’s finding of delib\n    erate cruelty. Applying Apprendi, this Court held the sentence un\n    constitutional. The State in Blakely endeavored to distinguish Ap\n    prendi, contending that Blakely’s sentence was within the judge’s\n    discretion based solely on the guilty verdict. The Court dismissed\n    that argument. Blakely could not have been sentenced above the\n    standard range absent an additional fact. Consequently, that fact\n    was subject to the Sixth Amendment’s jury-trial guarantee. It did\n    not matter that Blakely’s sentence, though outside the standard\n    range, was within the 10-year maximum. Because the judge could\n    not have imposed a sentence outside the standard range without\n    finding an additional fact, the top of that range—53 months, not 10\n    years—was the relevant statutory maximum. The Court also re\n    jected the State’s arguments that Apprendi was satisfied because the\n    Reform Act did not specify an exclusive catalog of facts on which a\n    judge might base a departure from the standard range, and because\n    it ultimately left the decision whether or not to depart to the judge’s\n    discretion.\n       Booker was sentenced under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.\n    The facts found by the jury yielded a base Guidelines range of 210 to\n    262 months’ imprisonment, a range the judge could not exceed with\n    out undertaking additional factfinding. The judge did so, making a\n    finding that boosted Booker into a higher Guidelines range. This\n    Court held Booker’s sentence impermissible under the Sixth Amend\n    ment. There was “no distinction of constitutional significance be\n    tween the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington proce\n    dures at issue in [Blakely].” 543 U. S., at 233. Both were “mandatory\n    and impose[d] binding requirements on all sentencing judges.” Ibid.\n    All Members of the Court agreed, however, that the Guidelines would\n    not implicate the Sixth Amendment if they were advisory. Ibid. Fac\n                   Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ning the remedial question, the Court concluded that rendering the\nGuidelines advisory came closest to what Congress would have in\ntended had it known that the Guidelines were vulnerable to a Sixth\nAmendment challenge. Under the advisory Guidelines system de\nscribed in Booker, judges would no longer be confined to the sentenc\ning range dictated by the Guidelines, but would be obliged to “take\naccount” of that range along with the sentencing goals enumerated in\nthe Sentencing Reform Act (SRA). Id., at 259, 264. In place of the\nSRA provision governing appellate review of sentences under the\nmandatory Guidelines scheme, the Court installed a “reasonableness”\nstandard of review. Id., at 261. Pp. 8–15.\n   (b) In all material respects, California’s DSL resembles the sen\ntencing systems invalidated in Blakely and Booker. Following the\nreasoning in those cases, the middle term prescribed under California\nlaw, not the upper term, is the relevant statutory maximum. Be\ncause aggravating facts that authorize the upper term are found by\nthe judge, and need only be established by a preponderance of the\nevidence, the DSL violates the rule of Apprendi.\n   While “that should be the end of the matter,” Blakely, 542 U. S., at\n313, in People v. Black, the California Supreme Court insisted that\nthe DSL survives inspection under our precedents. The Black court\nreasoned that, given the ample discretion afforded trial judges to\nidentify aggravating facts warranting an upper term sentence, the\nDSL did “not represent a legislative effort to shift the proof of par\nticular facts from elements of a crime (to be proved to a jury) to sen\ntencing factors (to be decided by a judge),” 35 Cal. 4th, at 1255–1256,\n113 P. 3d, at 543–544. This Court cautioned in Blakely, however,\nthat broad discretion to decide what facts may support an enhanced\nsentence, or to determine whether an enhanced sentence is war\nranted in a particular case, does not shield a sentencing system from\nthe force of this Court’s decisions. The Black court also urged that\nthe DSL is not cause for concern because it reduced the penalties for\nmost crimes over the prior indeterminate sentencing scheme; because\nthe system is fair to defendants; and because the DSL requires statu\ntory sentence enhancements (as distinguished from aggravators) to\nbe charged in the indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reason\nable doubt. The Black court’s examination, in short, satisfied it that\nCalifornia’s sentencing system does not implicate significantly the\nconcerns underlying the Sixth Amendment’s jury-trial guarantee.\nThis Court’s decisions, however, leave no room for such an examina\ntion. Asking whether a defendant’s basic jury-trial right is preserved,\nthough some facts essential to punishment are reserved for determi\nnation by the judge, is the very inquiry Apprendi’s bright-line rule\nwas designed to exclude.\n4                    CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       Ultimately, the Black court relied on an equation of California’s\n    DSL to the post-Booker federal system. That attempted comparison\n    is unavailing. The Booker Court held the Federal Guidelines incom\n    patible with the Sixth Amendment because they were “mandatory\n    and impose[d] binding requirements on all sentencing judges,” 543\n    U. S., at 233. To remedy the constitutional infirmity, the Court ex\n    cised provisions that rendered the system mandatory, leaving the\n    Guidelines in place as advisory only. The DSL, however, does not re\n    semble the advisory system the Court in Booker had in view. Under\n    California’s system, judges are not free to exercise their “discretion to\n    select a specific sentence within a defined range.” Ibid. California’s\n    Legislature has adopted sentencing triads, three fixed sentences with\n    no ranges between them. Cunningham’s sentencing judge had no\n    discretion to select a sentence within a range of 6 to 16 years, but had\n    to impose 12 years, nothing less and nothing more, unless the judge\n    found facts allowing a sentence of 6 or 16 years. Factfinding to ele\n    vate a sentence from 12 to 16 years, this Court’s decisions make\n    plain, falls within the province of the jury employing a beyond-a\n    reasonable-doubt standard, not the bailiwick of a judge determining\n    where the preponderance of the evidence lies.\n       The Black court attempted to rescue the DSL’s judicial factfinding\n    authority by typing it a reasonableness constraint, equivalent to the\n    constraint operative in the post-Booker federal system. Reasonable\n    ness, however, is not the touchstone of Sixth Amendment analysis.\n    The reasonableness requirement Booker anticipated for the federal\n    system operates within the constitutional constraints delineated in\n    this Court’s precedent, not as a substitute for those constraints. Be\n    cause the DSL allocates to judges sole authority to find facts permit\n    ting the imposition of an upper term sentence, the system violates\n    the Sixth Amendment. Booker’s remedy for the Federal Guidelines,\n    in short, is not a recipe for rendering this Court’s Sixth Amendment\n    case law toothless. Further elaboration here on the federal reason\n    ableness standard is neither necessary nor proper. The Court has\n    granted review in two cases—to be argued and decided later this\n    Term—raising questions trained on that matter. Claiborne v. United\n    States, No. 06–5618; Rita v. United States, No. 06–5754.

Several States have modified their systems\n    in the wake of Apprendi and Blakely to retain determinate sentenc\n    ing, by calling upon the jury to find any fact necessary to the imposi\n    tion of an elevated sentence. Other States have chosen to permit\n    judges genuinely “to exercise broad discretion . . . within a statutory\n    range,” which, “everyone agrees,” encounters no Sixth Amendment\n                     Cite as: 549 U.

The facts so found are neither inherent in the\njury’s verdict nor embraced by the defendant’s plea, and\nthey need only be established by a preponderance of the\nevidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.

We hold that it does.\n   As this Court’s decisions instruct, the Federal Constitu\ntion’s jury-trial guarantee proscribes a sentencing scheme\nthat allows a judge to impose a sentence above the statu\ntory maximum based on a fact, other than a prior convic\ntion, not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant.\nApprendi v.

S. 220\n(2005). “[T]he relevant ‘statutory maximum,’ ” this Court\nhas clarified, “is not the maximum sentence a judge may\n2                  CUNNINGHAM v.

S., at 303–304 (emphasis in original). In petitioner’s\ncase, the jury’s verdict alone limited the permissible sen\ntence to 12 years. Additional factfinding by the trial\njudge, however, yielded an upper term sentence of 16\nyears. The California Court of Appeal affirmed the\nharsher sentence. We reverse that disposition because the\nfour-year elevation based on judicial factfinding denied\npetitioner his right to a jury trial.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  Petitioner John Cunningham was tried and convicted of\ncontinuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14.\nUnder the DSL, that offense is punishable by imprison\nment for a lower term sentence of 6 years, a middle term\nsentence of 12 years, or an upper term sentence of 16\nyears.

As further explained below, see infra,\nat 4–7, the DSL obliged the trial judge to sentence Cun\nningham to the 12-year middle term unless the judge\nfound one or more additional facts in aggravation. Based\non a post-trial sentencing hearing, the trial judge found by\na preponderance of the evidence six aggravating circum\nstances, among them, the particular vulnerability of Cun\nningham’s victim, and Cunningham’s violent conduct,\nwhich indicated a serious danger to the community.

In contrast, the DSL fixed\nthe terms of imprisonment for most offenses, and elimi\nnated the possibility of early release on parole. See Penal\nCode §3000 et seq. (West Supp. 2006); 3 B.

Penal Code §1170(a)(1); Black, 35\nCal. 4th, at 1246, 113 P. 3d, at 537.\n   For most offenses, including Cunningham’s, the DSL\nregime is implemented in the following manner. The\nstatute defining the offense prescribes three precise terms\nof imprisonment—a lower, middle, and upper term sen\ntence. E.g., Penal Code §288.5(a) (West 1999) (a person\nconvicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child “shall be\npunished by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of\n6, 12, or 16 years”). See also Black, 35 Cal. 4th, at 1247,\n113 P. 3d, at 538. Penal Code §1170(b) (West Supp. 2006)\ncontrols the trial judge’s choice; it provides that “the court\nshall order imposition of the middle term, unless there are\ncircumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.”\n“[C]ircumstances in aggravation or mitigation” are to be\ndetermined by the court after consideration of several\nitems: the trial record; the probation officer’s report;\nstatements in aggravation or mitigation submitted by the\nparties, the victim, or the victim’s family; “and any further\nevidence introduced at the sentencing hearing.” Ibid.\n   The DSL directed the State’s Judicial Council4 to adopt\n——————\n  3 Murder and certain other grave offenses still carry lengthy indeter\n\nminate terms with the possibility of early release on parole.

Facts aggravating an offense, the Rules\ninstruct, “shall be established by a preponderance of the\nevidence,” Rule 4.420(b),6 and must be “stated orally on\nthe record.” Rule 4.420(e).\n   The Rules provide a nonexhaustive list of aggravating\ncircumstances, including “[f]acts relating to the crime,”\nRule 4.421(a),7 “[f]acts relating to the defendant,” Rule\n4.421(b),8 and “[a]ny other facts statutorily declared to be\ncircumstances in aggravation,” Rule 4.421(c). Beyond the\nenumerated circumstances, “the judge is free to consider\nany ‘additional criteria reasonably related to the decision\nbeing made.’ ” Black, 35 Cal. 4th, at 1247, 113 P. 3d, at\n538 (quoting Rule 4.408(a)). “A fact that is an element of\n\n——————\nConstitution grants the Council authority, inter alia, “to adopt rules for\ncourt administration, practice and procedure, and perform other\nfunctions prescribed by statute.” Art. 6, §6(d).\n  5 The Rules were amended on January 1, 2007. Those amendments\n\nmade technical changes, none of them material to the constitutional\nquestion before us. We refer in this opinion to the prior text of the\nRules, upon which the parties and principal authorities rely.\n  6 The judge must provide a statement of reasons for a sentence only\n\nwhen a lower or upper term sentence is imposed. Rules 4.406(b),\n4.420(e).\n  7E.g., Rule 4.421(a)(1) (“[T]he fact that . . . [t]he crime involved great\n\nviolence, great bodily harm, threat of great bodily harm, or other acts\ndisclosing a high degree of cruelty, viciousness, or callousness.”).\n  8 E.g., Rule 4.421(b)(1) (“[T]he fact that . . . [t]he defendant has en\n\ngaged in violent conduct which indicates a serious danger to society.”).\n6                   CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthe crime,” however, “shall not be used to impose the\nupper term.” Rule 4.420(d). In sum, California’s DSL, and\nthe rules governing its application, direct the sentencing\ncourt to start with the middle term, and to move from that\nterm only when the court itself finds and places on the\nrecord facts—whether related to the offense or the of\nfender—beyond the elements of the charged offense.\n   JUSTICE ALITO maintains, however, that a circumstance\nin aggravation need not be a fact at all. In his view, a\npolicy judgment, or even a judge’s “subjective belief” re\ngarding the appropriate sentence, qualifies as an aggra\nvating circumstance. Post, at 11–12 (dissenting opinion).\nCalifornia’s Rules, however, constantly refer to “facts.” As\njust noted, the Rules define “circumstances in aggrava\ntion” as “facts which justify the imposition of the upper\nprison term.” Rule 4.405(d) (emphasis added).9 And\n“circumstances in aggravation,” the Rules unambiguously\ndeclare, “shall be established by a preponderance of the\nevidence,” Rule 4.420(b), a clear factfinding directive to\nwhich there is no exception. See People v. Hall, 8 Cal. 4th\n950, 957, 883 P. 2d 974, 978 (1994) (“Selection of the upper\nterm is justified only if circumstances in aggravation are\nestablished by a preponderance of evidence . . . .” (empha\nsis added)).\n  While the Rules list “[g]eneral objectives of sentencing,”\nRule 4.410(a), nowhere are these objectives cast as “cir\ncumstances in aggravation” that alone authorize an upper\nterm sentence. The Rules also state that “[t]he enumera\ntion . . . of some criteria for the making of discretionary\nsentencing decisions does not prohibit the application of\n——————\n  9 See also, e.g., Rule 4.420(b) (“Selection of the upper term is justified\n\nonly if, after a consideration of all the relevant facts, the circumstances\nin aggravation outweigh the circumstances in mitigation.” (emphasis\nadded)); Rule 4.420(e) (court must provide “a concise statement of the\nultimate facts that the court deemed to constitute circumstances in\naggravation or mitigation” (emphasis added)).\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

California courts have not read this\nlanguage to unmoor “circumstances in aggravation” from\nany factfinding anchor.\n   In line with the Rules, the California Supreme Court\nhas repeatedly referred to circumstances in aggravation as\nfacts. See, e.g., Black, 35 Cal. 4th, at 1256, 113 P. 3d, at\n544 (“The Legislature did not identify all of the particular\nfacts that could justify the upper term.” (emphasis added));\nPeople v. Wiley, 9 Cal. 4th 580, 587, 889 P. 2d 541, 545\n(1995) (“[T]rial courts are assigned the task of deciding\nwhether to impose an upper or lower term of imprison\nment based upon their determination whether there are\ncircumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime, a\ndetermination that invariably requires numerous factual\nfindings.” (emphasis added and internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   It is unsurprising, then, that State’s counsel, at oral\nargument, acknowledged that he knew of no case in which\na California trial judge had gone beyond the middle term\nbased not on any fact the judge found, but solely on the\nbasis of a policy judgment or subjective belief. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 49–50.\n   Notably, the Penal Code permits elevation of a sentence\nabove the upper term based on specified statutory en\nhancements relating to the defendant’s criminal history or\ncircumstances of the crime. See, e.g., Penal Code §667 et\nseq. (West Supp. 2006); §12022 et seq. See also Black, 35\nCal. 4th, at 1257, 113 P. 3d, at 545. Unlike aggravating\ncircumstances, statutory enhancements must be charged\nin the indictment, and the underlying facts must be\nproved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Penal Code\n§1170.1(e); Black, 35 Cal. 4th, at 1257, 113 P. 3d, at 545.\nA fact underlying an enhancement cannot do double duty;\nit cannot be used to impose an upper term sentence and,\non top of that, an enhanced term. Penal Code §1170(b).\n8              CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWhere permitted by statute, however, a judge may use a\nfact qualifying as an enhancer to impose an upper term\nrather than an enhanced sentence. Ibid.; Rule 4.420(c).\n                             II\n  This Court has repeatedly held that, under the Sixth\nAmendment, any fact that exposes a defendant to a\ngreater potential sentence must be found by a jury, not a\njudge, and established beyond a reasonable doubt, not\nmerely by a preponderance of the evidence. While this\nrule is rooted in longstanding common-law practice, its\nexplicit statement in our decisions is recent. In Jones v.\nUnited States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999), we examined the\nSixth Amendment’s historical and doctrinal foundations,\nand recognized that judicial factfinding operating to in\ncrease a defendant’s otherwise maximum punishment\nposed a grave constitutional question. Id., at 239–252.\nWhile the Court construed the statute at issue to avoid the\nquestion, the Jones opinion presaged our decision, some 15\nmonths later, in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466\n(2000).\n  Charles Apprendi was convicted of possession of a fire\narm for an unlawful purpose, a second-degree offense\nunder New Jersey law punishable by five to ten years’\nimprisonment. Id., at 468. A separate “hate crime” stat\nute authorized an “extended term” of imprisonment: Ten\nto twenty years could be imposed if the trial judge found,\nby a preponderance of the evidence, that “ ‘[t]he defendant\nin committing the crime acted with a purpose to intimi\ndate an individual or group of individuals because of race,\ncolor, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or\nethnicity.’ ” Id., at 468–469 (quoting N. J. Stat. Ann.\n§2C:44–3(e) (West Supp. 1999–2000)). The judge in Ap\nprendi’s case so found, and therefore sentenced the defen\ndant to 12 years’ imprisonment. This Court held that the\nSixth Amendment proscribed the enhanced sentence. 530\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 471. Other than a prior conviction, see Almen\ndarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 239–247\n(1998), we held in Apprendi, “any fact that increases the\npenalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maxi\nmum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” 530 U. S., at 490. See also Harris v.\nUnited States, 536 U. S. 545, 557–566 (2002) (plurality\nopinion) (“Apprendi said that any fact extending the de\nfendant’s sentence beyond the maximum authorized by\nthe jury’s verdict would have been considered an element\nof an aggravated crime—and thus the domain of the\njury—by those who framed the Bill of Rights.”).\n   We have since reaffirmed the rule of Apprendi, applying\nit to facts subjecting a defendant to the death penalty,\nRing v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 602, 609 (2002), facts\npermitting a sentence in excess of the “standard range”\nunder Washington’s Sentencing Reform Act, Blakely v.\nWashington, 542 U. S. 296, 304–305 (2004), and facts\ntriggering a sentence range elevation under the then-\nmandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines, United States\nv. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 243–244 (2005). Blakely and\nBooker bear most closely on the question presented in this\ncase.\n   Ralph Howard Blakely was convicted of second-degree\nkidnapping with a firearm, a class B felony under Wash\nington law. Blakely, 542 U. S., at 298–299. While the\noverall statutory maximum for a class B felony was ten\nyears, the State’s Sentencing Reform Act (Reform Act)\nadded an important qualification: If no facts beyond those\nreflected in the jury’s verdict were found by the trial judge,\na defendant could not receive a sentence above a “standard\nrange” of 49 to 53 months. Id., at 299–300. The Reform\nAct permitted but did not require a judge to exceed that\nstandard range if she found “ ‘substantial and compelling\nreasons justifying an exceptional sentence.’ ” Ibid. (quot\ning Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §9.94A.120(2) (2000)). The\n10              CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nReform Act set out a nonexhaustive list of aggravating\nfacts on which such a sentence elevation could be based.\nIt also clarified that a fact taken into account in fixing the\nstandard range—i.e., any fact found by the jury—could\nunder no circumstances count in the determination\nwhether to impose an exceptional sentence. 542 U. S., at\n299–300. Blakely was sentenced to 90 months’ imprison\nment, more than three years above the standard range,\nbased on the trial judge’s finding that he had acted with\ndeliberate cruelty. Id., at 300.\n   Applying the rule of Apprendi, this Court held Blakely’s\nsentence unconstitutional. The State in Blakely had\nendeavored to distinguish Apprendi on the ground that\n“[u]nder the Washington guidelines, an exceptional sen\ntence is within the court’s discretion as a result of a guilty\nverdict.” Brief for Respondent in Blakely v. Washington,\nO.T. 2003, No. 02–1632, p. 15. We rejected that argument.\nThe judge could not have sentenced Blakely above the\nstandard range without finding the additional fact of\ndeliberate cruelty. Consequently, that fact was subject to\nthe Sixth Amendment’s jury-trial guarantee. 542 U. S., at\n304–314. It did not matter, we explained, that Blakely’s\nsentence, though outside the standard range, was within\nthe 10-year maximum for class B felonies:\n     “Our precedents make clear . . . that the ‘statutory\n     maximum’ for Apprendi purposes is the maximum\n     sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the\n     facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the de\n     fendant . . . . In other words, the relevant ‘statutory\n     maximum’ is not the maximum sentence a judge may\n     impose after finding additional facts, but the maxi\n     mum he may impose without any additional findings.\n     When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury’s ver\n     dict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all\n     the facts ‘which the law makes essential to the pun\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

S., at 304.\n   The State had additionally argued in Blakely that Ap\nprendi’s rule was satisfied because Washington’s Reform\nAct did not specify an exclusive catalog of potential facts\non which a judge might base a departure from the stan\ndard range. This Court rejected that argument as well.\n“Whether the judge’s authority to impose an enhanced\nsentence depends on finding a specified fact . . . one of\nseveral specified facts . . . or any aggravating fact (as\nhere),” we observed, “it remains the case that the jury’s\nverdict alone does not authorize the sentence.” 542 U. S.,\nat 305 (emphasis in original). Further, we held it irrele\nvant that the Reform Act ultimately left the decision\nwhether or not to depart to the judge’s discretion:\n“Whether the judicially determined facts require a sen\ntence enhancement or merely allow it,” we noted, “the\nverdict alone does not authorize the sentence.” Ibid., n. 8\n(emphasis in original).\n   Freddie Booker was convicted of possession with intent\nto distribute crack cocaine and was sentenced under the\nFederal Sentencing Guidelines.       The facts found by\nBooker’s jury yielded a base Guidelines range of 210 to 262\nmonths’ imprisonment, a range the judge could not exceed\nwithout undertaking additional factfinding. Booker, 543\nU. S., at 227, 233–234. The judge did so, finding by a\npreponderance of the evidence that Booker possessed an\namount of drugs in excess of the amount determined by\nthe jury’s verdict. That finding boosted Booker into a\n12                CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhigher Guidelines range. Booker was sentenced at the\nbottom of the higher range, to 360 months in prison. Id.,\nat 227.\n   In an opinion written by JUSTICE STEVENS for a five-\nMember majority, the Court held Booker’s sentence im\npermissible under the Sixth Amendment. In the major\nity’s judgment, there was “no distinction of constitutional\nsignificance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines\nand the Washington procedures at issue in [Blakely].” Id.,\nat 233. Both systems were “mandatory and impose[d]\nbinding requirements on all sentencing judges.” Ibid.10\nJUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion for the Court, it bears empha\nsis, next expressed a view on which there was no dis\nagreement among the Justices. He acknowledged that the\nFederal Guidelines would not implicate the Sixth Amend\nment were they advisory:\n       “If the Guidelines as currently written could be read\n     as merely advisory provisions that recommended,\n     rather than required, the selection of particular sen\n     tences in response to differing sets of facts, their use\n     would not implicate the Sixth Amendment. We have\n     never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise\n     broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a\n     statutory range. Indeed, everyone agrees that the\n     constitutional issues presented by [this case] would\n     have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted\n——————\n  10 California’s DSL, we note in this context, resembles pre-Booker\n\nfederal sentencing in the same ways Washington’s sentencing system\ndid: The key California Penal Code provision states that the sentencing\ncourt “shall order imposition of the middle term” absent “circumstances\nin aggravation or mitigation of the crime,” §1170(b) (emphasis added),\nand any move to the upper or lower term must be justified by “a concise\nstatement of the ultimate facts” on which the departure rests, Rule\n4.420(e) (emphasis added).

Three choices were apparent: the\nCourt could invalidate in its entirety the Sentencing Re\nform Act of 1984 (SRA), the law comprehensively delineat\ning the federal sentencing system; or it could preserve the\nSRA, and the mandatory Guidelines regime the SRA\nestablished, by attaching a jury-trial requirement to any\nfact increasing a defendant’s base Guidelines range; fi\nnally, the Court could render the Guidelines advisory by\nsevering two provisions of the SRA, 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1)\nand 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). 543 U. S., at 246–\n249.11 Recognizing that “reasonable minds can, and do,\n——————\n  11 Title18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1) mandated the imposition of a Guide\nlines sentence unless the district court found “an aggravating or miti\ngating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into\nconsideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guide\nlines.” Section 3742(e) directed the court of appeals to determine, inter\nalia, whether the district court correctly applied the Guidelines,\n§3742(e)(2), and, if the sentence imposed fell outside the applicable\nGuidelines range, whether the sentencing judge had provided a written\nstatement of reasons, whether §3553(b) and the facts of the case war\nranted the departure, and whether the degree of departure was reason\nable, §3742(e)(3).\n14                 CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndiffer” on the remedial question, the majority concluded\nthat the advisory Guidelines solution came closest to the\ncongressional mark. Id., at 248–258.\n  Under the system described in JUSTICE BREYER’s opin\nion for the Court in Booker, judges would no longer be tied\nto the sentencing range indicated in the Guidelines. But\nthey would be obliged to “take account of” that range along\nwith the sentencing goals Congress enumerated in the\nSRA at 18 U. S. C. §3553(a). 543 U. S., at 259, 264.12\nHaving severed §3742(e), the provision of the SRA govern\ning appellate review of sentences under the mandatory\nGuidelines scheme, see supra, at 13, and n. 11, the Court\ninstalled, as consistent with the Act and the sound ad\nministration of justice, a “reasonableness” standard of\nreview. 543 U. S., at 261. Without attempting an elabo\nrate discussion of that standard, JUSTICE BREYER’s reme\ndial opinion for the Court observed: “Section 3553(a) re\nmains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide\nsentencing. Those factors in turn will guide appellate\ncourts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a\nsentence is reasonable.” Ibid.13 The Court emphasized\n——————\n  12 Section 3553(a) instructs sentencing judges to consider “the nature\n\nand circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of\nthe defendant,” “the kinds of sentences available,” and the Guidelines\nand policy statements issued by the United States Sentencing Commis\nsion. §3553(a)(1), (3)–(5). Avoidance of unwarranted sentencing\ndisparities, and the need to provide restitution, are also listed as\nconcerns to which the judge should respond. §3553(a)(6)–(7).\n  In a further enumeration, §3553(a) calls for the imposition of “a sen\ntence sufficient, but not greater than necessary” to “reflect the serious\nness of the offense,” “promote respect for the law,” “provide just pun\nishment for the offense,” “afford adequate deterrence to criminal\nconduct,” “protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,” and\n“provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,\nmedical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective\nmanner.” §3553(a)(2).\n  13 While this case does not call for elaboration of the reasonableness\n\ncheck on federal sentencing post-Booker, we note that the Court has\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe provisional character of the Booker remedy. Recogniz\ning that authority to speak “the last word” resides in\nCongress, the Court said:\n     “The ball now lies in Congress’ court. The National\n     Legislature is equipped to devise and install, long\n     term, the sentencing system, compatible with the\n     Constitution, that Congress judges best for the federal\n     system of justice.” Id., at 265.\n  We turn now to the instant case in light of both parts of\nthe Court’s Booker opinion, and our earlier decisions in\npoint.\n                             III\n   Under California’s DSL, an upper term sentence may be\nimposed only when the trial judge finds an aggravating\ncircumstance. See supra, at 4–5. An element of the\ncharged offense, essential to a jury’s determination of\nguilt, or admitted in a defendant’s guilty plea, does not\nqualify as such a circumstance. See supra, at 5–6. In\nstead, aggravating circumstances depend on facts found\ndiscretely and solely by the judge. In accord with Blakely,\ntherefore, the middle term prescribed in California’s stat\n——————\ngranted review in two cases raising questions trained on that matter:\nClaiborne v. United States, No. 06–5618 (cert. granted, Nov. 3, 2006);\nand Rita v. United States, No. 06–5754 (cert. granted, Nov. 3, 2006). In\nClaiborne, the Court will consider whether it is consistent with the\nadvisory cast of the Guidelines system post-Booker to require that\nextraordinary circumstances attend a sentence varying substantially\nfrom the Guidelines. Rita includes the question whether is it consistent\nwith Booker to accord a presumption of reasonableness to a within-\nGuidelines sentence.\n  In this regard, we note JUSTICE ALITO’s view that California’s DSL is\nessentially the same as post-Booker federal sentencing. Post, at 1–10.\nTo maintain that position, his dissent previews, without benefit of\nbriefing or argument, how “reasonableness review,” post-Booker, works.\nPost, at 13–15. It is neither necessary nor proper now to join issue with\nJUSTICE ALITO on this matter.\n16              CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nutes, not the upper term, is the relevant statutory maxi\nmum. 542 U. S., at 303 (“[T]he ‘statutory maximum’ for\nApprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may\nimpose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury\nverdict or admitted by the defendant.” (emphasis in origi\nnal)). Because circumstances in aggravation are found by\nthe judge, not the jury, and need only be established by a\npreponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, see supra, at 5, the DSL violates Apprendi’s bright-\nline rule: Except for a prior conviction, “any fact that\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 530 U. S., at 490.\n   While “[t]hat should be the end of the matter,” Blakely,\n542 U. S., at 313, in People v. Black, the California Su\npreme Court held otherwise. In that court’s view, the DSL\nsurvived examination under our precedent intact. See 35\nCal. 4th, at 1254–1261, 113 P. 3d, at 543–548. The Black\ncourt acknowledged that California’s system appears on\nsurface inspection to be in tension with the rule of Ap\nprendi. But in “operation and effect,” the court said, the\nDSL “simply authorize[s] a sentencing court to engage in\nthe type of factfinding that traditionally has been incident\nto the judge’s selection of an appropriate sentence within a\nstatutorily prescribed sentencing range.” 35 Cal. 4th, at\n1254, 113 P. 3d, at 543. Therefore, the court concluded,\n“the upper term is the ‘statutory maximum’ and a trial\ncourt’s imposition of an upper term sentence does not\nviolate a defendant’s right to a jury trial under the princi\nples set forth in Apprendi, Blakely, and Booker.” Ibid.\nBut see id., at 1270, 113 P. 3d, at 554 (Kennard, J., con\ncurring and dissenting) (“Nothing in the high court’s\nmajority opinions in Apprendi, Blakely, and Booker sug\ngests that the constitutionality of a state’s sentencing\nscheme turns on whether, in the words of the majority\nhere, it involves the type of factfinding ‘that traditionally\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhas been performed by a judge.’ ” (quoting id., at 1253, 113\nP. 3d, at 542)).\n   The Black court’s conclusion that the upper term, and\nnot the middle term, qualifies as the relevant statutory\nmaximum, rested on several considerations. First, the\ncourt reasoned that, given the ample discretion afforded\ntrial judges to identify aggravating facts warranting an\nupper term sentence, the DSL\n    “does not represent a legislative effort to shift the\n    proof of particular facts from elements of a crime (to\n    be proved to a jury) to sentencing factors (to be de\n    cided by a judge). . . . Instead, it afforded the sentenc\n    ing judge the discretion to decide, with the guidance of\n    rules and statutes, whether the facts of the case and\n    the history of the defendant justify the higher sen\n    tence. Such a system does not diminish the tradi\n    tional power of the jury.” Id., at 1256, 113 P. 3d, at\n    544 (footnote omitted).\n   We cautioned in Blakely, however, that broad discretion\nto decide what facts may support an enhanced sentence, or\nto determine whether an enhanced sentence is warranted\nin any particular case, does not shield a sentencing system\nfrom the force of our decisions. If the jury’s verdict alone\ndoes not authorize the sentence, if, instead, the judge must\nfind an additional fact to impose the longer term, the Sixth\nAmendment requirement is not satisfied. Blakely, 542\nU. S., at 305, and n. 8.\n   The Black court also urged that the DSL is not cause for\nconcern because it reduced the penalties for most crimes\nover the prior indeterminate sentencing regime. 35 Cal.\n4th, at 1256–1258, 113 P. 3d, at 544–545. But see id., at\n1271–1272, 113 P. 3d, at 555 (Kennard, J., concurring and\ndissenting) (“This aspect of our sentencing law does not\ndiffer significantly from the Washington sentencing\nscheme [the high court invalidated in Blakely.]”); supra, at\n18                CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n10. Furthermore, California’s system is not unfair to\ndefendants, for they “cannot reasonably expect a guaran\ntee that the upper term will not be imposed” given judges’\nbroad discretion to impose an upper term sentence or to\nkeep their punishment at the middle term. 35 Cal. 4th, at\n1258–1259, 113 P. 3d, at 545–546. The Black court addi\ntionally noted that the DSL requires statutory enhance\nments (as distinguished from aggravators)—e.g., the use of\na firearm or other dangerous weapon, infliction of great\nbodily injury, Penal Code §§12022, 12022.7–.8 (West 2000\nand Supp. 2006)—to be charged in the indictment and\nproved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 35 Cal. 4th,\nat 1257, 113 P. 3d, at 545.\n   The Black court’s examination of the DSL, in short,\nsatisfied it that California’s sentencing system does not\nimplicate significantly the concerns underlying the Sixth\nAmendment’s jury-trial guarantee. Our decisions, how\never, leave no room for such an examination. Asking\nwhether a defendant’s basic jury-trial right is preserved,\nthough some facts essential to punishment are reserved\nfor determination by the judge, we have said, is the very\ninquiry Apprendi’s “bright-line rule” was designed to\nexclude. See Blakely, 542 U. S., at 307–308. But see\nBlack, 35 Cal. 4th, at 1260, 113 P. 3d, at 547 (stating,\nremarkably, that “[t]he high court precedents do not draw\na bright line”).14\n   Ultimately, the Black court relied on an equation of\nCalifornia’s DSL system to the post-Booker federal system.\n——————\n  14JUSTICE  KENNEDY urges a distinction between facts concerning the\noffense, where Apprendi would apply, and facts concerning the offender,\nwhere it would not. Post, at 1–2 (dissenting opinion). Apprendi itself,\nhowever, leaves no room for the bifurcated approach JUSTICE KENNEDY\nproposes. See 530 U. S., at 490 (“[A]ny fact that increases the penalty\nfor a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submit\nted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” (emphasis\nadded)).\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“The level of discretion available to a California judge in\nselecting which of the three available terms to impose,”\nthe court said, “appears comparable to the level of discre\ntion that the high court has chosen to permit federal\njudges in post-Booker sentencing.” 35 Cal. 4th, at 1261,\n113 P. 3d, at 548. The same equation drives JUSTICE\nALITO’s dissent. See post, at 1 (“The California sentencing\nlaw . . . is indistinguishable in any constitutionally signifi\ncant respect from the advisory Guidelines scheme that the\nCourt approved in [Booker].”).\n   The attempted comparison is unavailing. As earlier\nexplained, see supra, at 12–13, this Court in Booker held\nthe Federal Sentencing Guidelines incompatible with the\nSixth Amendment because the Guidelines were “manda\ntory and imposed binding requirements on all sentencing\njudges.” 543 U. S., at 233. “[M]erely advisory provisions,”\nrecommending but not requiring “the selection of particu\nlar sentences in response to differing sets of facts,” all\nMembers of the Court agreed, “would not implicate the\nSixth Amendment.” Ibid. To remedy the constitutional\ninfirmity found in Booker, the Court’s majority excised\nprovisions that rendered the system mandatory, leaving\nthe Guidelines in place as advisory only. Id., at 245–246.\nSee also supra, at 13–14.\n   California’s DSL does not resemble the advisory system\nthe Booker Court had in view. Under California’s system,\njudges are not free to exercise their “discretion to select a\nspecific sentence within a defined range.” Booker, 543\nU. S., at 233. California’s Legislature has adopted sen\ntencing triads, three fixed sentences with no ranges be\ntween them. Cunningham’s sentencing judge had no\ndiscretion to select a sentence within a range of 6 to 16\nyears. Her instruction was to select 12 years, nothing less\nand nothing more, unless she found facts allowing the\nimposition of a sentence of 6 or 16 years. Factfinding to\nelevate a sentence from 12 to 16 years, our decisions make\n20                 CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nplain, falls within the province of the jury employing a\nbeyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, not the bailiwick of a\njudge determining where the preponderance of the evi\ndence lies.\n  Nevertheless, the Black court attempted to rescue the\nDSL’s judicial factfinding authority by typing it simply a\nreasonableness constraint, equivalent to the constraint\noperative in the federal system post-Booker. See 35 Cal.\n4th, at 1261, 113 P. 3d, at 548 (“Because an aggravating\nfactor under California law may include any factor that\nthe judge reasonably deems relevant, the [DSL’s] require\nment that an upper term sentence be imposed only if an\naggravating factor exists is comparable to Booker’s re\nquirement that a federal judge’s sentencing decision not be\nunreasonable.”). Reasonableness, however, is not, as the\nBlack court would have it, the touchstone of Sixth\nAmendment analysis. The reasonableness requirement\nBooker anticipated for the federal system operates within\nthe Sixth Amendment constraints delineated in our prece\ndent, not as a substitute for those constraints. Because\nthe DSL allocates to judges sole authority to find facts\npermitting the imposition of an upper term sentence, the\nsystem violates the Sixth Amendment. It is comforting,\nbut beside the point, that California’s system requires\njudge-determined DSL sentences to be reasonable.\nBooker’s remedy for the Federal Guidelines, in short, is\nnot a recipe for rendering our Sixth Amendment case law\ntoothless.15\n——————\n  15 JUSTICE ALITO, however, would do just that. His opinion reads the\nremedial portion of the Court’s opinion in Booker to override Blakely,\nand to render academic the entire first part of Booker itself. Post, at\n13–15. There would have been no majority in Booker for the revision of\nBlakely essayed in his dissent. Grounded in a notion of how federal\nreasonableness review operates in practice, JUSTICE ALITO “necessarily\nanticipates” a question that will be aired later this Term in Rita and\nClaiborne.

Because the DSL\nauthorizes the judge, not the jury, to find the facts permit\nting an upper term sentence, the system cannot withstand\nmeasurement against our Sixth Amendment precedent.16\n                               IV\n   As to the adjustment of California’s sentencing system\nin light of our decision, “[t]he ball . . . lies in [California’s]\ncourt.” Booker, 543 U. S., at 265; cf. supra, at 15. We note\nthat several States have modified their systems in the\nwake of Apprendi and Blakely to retain determinate sen\ntencing. They have done so by calling upon the jury—\neither at trial or in a separate sentencing proceeding—to\nfind any fact necessary to the imposition of an elevated\nsentence.17 As earlier noted, California already employs\n——————\nresponses in those cases, we affirm the continuing vitality of our prior\ndecisions in point.\n  16 Respondent and its amici argue that whatever this Court makes of\n\nCalifornia’s sentencing law, the Black court’s “construction” of that law\nas consistent with the Sixth Amendment is authoritative. Brief for\nRespondent 6, 18, 33; Brief for Hawaii et al. as Amici Curiae 17, 29.\nWe disagree. The Black court did not modify California law so as to\nalign it with this Court’s Sixth Amendment precedent. See 35 Cal. 4th,\nat 1273, 113 P. 3d, at 555–556 (Kennard, J., concurring and dissenting).\nRather, it construed this Court’s decisions in an endeavor to render\nthem consistent with California law. The Black court’s interpretation\nof federal constitutional law plainly does not qualify for this Court’s\ndeference.\n  17 States that have so altered their systems are Alaska, Arizona, Kan\n\nsas, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington. Alaska Stat.\n§§12.55.155(f), 12.55.125(c) (2004); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–702.01\n(West Supp. 2006); Kan. Stat. Ann. §§21–4716(b), 21–4718(b) (2005\nSupp.); Minn.

S. 466 (2000). See, e.g., United States\nv. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 326–334 (2005) (BREYER, J.,\ndissenting in part); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296,\n314–324 (2004) (O’Connor, J., dissenting); id., at 326–328\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting); see also Apprendi, supra, at\n523–554 (O’Connor, J., dissenting); Jones v. United States,\n526 U. S. 227, 264–272 (1999) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\nThe discussion in his dissenting opinion is fully sufficient\nto show why, in my respectful view, the Court’s analysis\nand holding are mistaken. It does seem appropriate to\nadd this brief, further comment.\n  In my view the Apprendi line of cases remains incorrect.\nYet there may be a principled rationale permitting those\ncases to control within the central sphere of their concern,\nwhile reducing the collateral, widespread harm to the\ncriminal justice system and the corrections process now\nresulting from the Court’s wooden, unyielding insistence\non expanding the Apprendi doctrine far beyond its neces\nsary boundaries. The Court could distinguish between\nsentencing enhancements based on the nature of the\noffense, where the Apprendi principle would apply, and\n2               CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsentencing enhancements based on the nature of the\noffender, where it would not. California attempted to\nmake this initial distinction. Compare Cal. Rule of Court\n4.421(a) (Criminal Cases) (West 2006) (listing aggravating\n“[f]acts relating to the crime”), with Rule 4.421(b) (listing\naggravating “[f]acts relating to the defendant”). The Court\nshould not foreclose its efforts.\n   California, as the Court notes, experimented earlier\nwith an indeterminate sentencing system. Ante, at 3. The\nState reposed vast power and discretion in a nonjudicial\nagency to set a release date for convicted felons. That\nsystem, it seems, would have been untouched by Apprendi.\nWhen the State sought to reform its system, it might have\nchosen to give its judges the authority to sentence to a\nmaximum but to depart downward for unexplained rea\nsons. That too, by considerable irony, would be untouched\nby Apprendi. Instead, California sought to use a system\nbased on guided discretion. Apprendi, the Court holds\ntoday, forecloses this option.\n   As dissenting opinions have suggested before, the Con\nstitution ought not to be interpreted to strike down all\naspects of sentencing systems that grant judicial discre\ntion with some legislative direction and control. Judges\nand legislators must have the capacity to develop consis\ntent standards, standards that individual juries empan\neled for only a short time cannot elaborate in any perma\nnent way. See, e.g., Blakely, 542 U. S., at 314 (opinion of\nO’Connor, J.); id., at 326–327 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)\n(explaining that “[s]entencing guidelines are a prime\nexample of [the] collaborative process” between courts and\nlegislatures). Judges and sentencing officials have a broad\nview and long-term commitment to correctional systems.\nJuries do not. Judicial officers and corrections profession\nals, under the guidance and control of the legislature,\nshould be encouraged to participate in an ongoing manner\nto improve the various sentencing schemes in our country.\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   This system of guided discretion would be permitted to a\nlarge extent if the Court confined the Apprendi rule to\nsentencing enhancements based on the nature of the\noffense. These would include, for example, the fact that a\nweapon was used; violence was employed; a stated amount\nof drugs or other contraband was involved; or the crime\nwas motivated by the victim’s race, gender, or other status\nprotected by statute. Juries could consider these matters\nwithout serious disruption because these factors often are\npart of the statutory definition of an aggravated crime in\nany event and because the evidence to support these\nenhancements is likely to be a central part of the prosecu\ntion’s case.\n   On the other hand, judicial determination is appropriate\nwith regard to factors exhibited by the defendant. These\nwould include, for example, prior convictions; cooperation\nor noncooperation with law enforcement; remorse or the\nlack of it; or other aspects of the defendant’s history bear\ning upon his background and contribution to the commu\nnity. This is so even if the relevant facts were to be found\nby the judge by a preponderance of the evidence. These\nare facts that should be taken into account at sentencing\nbut have little if any significance for whether the defen\ndant committed the crime. See Berman & Bibas, Making\nSentencing Sensible, 4 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 37, 55–57\n(2006).\n   The line between offense and offender would not always\nbe clear, but in most instances the nature of the offense is\ndefined in a manner that ensures the problem of catego\nries would not be difficult. Apprendi suffers from a similar\nline-drawing problem between facts that must be consid\nered by the jury and other considerations that a judge can\ntake into account. The main part of the Apprendi holding\ncould be retained with far less systemic disruption. It is to\nbe regretted that the Court’s decision today appears to\nforeclose consideration of this approach or other reason\n4              CUNNINGHAM v.

CALIFORNIA\n   ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF\n\n        CALIFORNIA, FIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\n                      [January 22, 2007]\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY and\nJUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.\n  The California sentencing law that the Court strikes\ndown today is indistinguishable in any constitutionally\nsignificant respect from the advisory Guidelines scheme\nthat the Court approved in United States v. Booker, 543\nU. S. 220 (2005). Both sentencing schemes grant trial\njudges considerable discretion in sentencing; both subject\nthe exercise of that discretion to appellate review for\n“reasonableness”; and both—the California law explicitly,\nand the federal scheme implicitly—require a sentencing\njudge to find some factor to justify a sentence above the\nminimum that could be imposed based solely on the jury’s\nverdict. Because this Court has held unequivocally that\nthe post-Booker federal sentencing system satisfies the\nrequirements of the Sixth Amendment, the same should\nbe true with regard to the California system. I therefore\nrespectfully dissent.\n                            I\n  In Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and the\ncases that have followed in its wake, the Court has held\nthat under certain circumstances a criminal defendant\npossesses the Sixth Amendment right to have a jury find\nfacts that result in an increased sentence. The Court,\nhowever, has never suggested that all factual findings that\n2                  CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\naffect a defendant’s sentence must be made by a jury. On\nthe contrary, in Apprendi and later cases, the Court has\nconsistently stated that when a trial court makes a fully\ndiscretionary sentencing decision (such as a sentencing\ndecision under the pre-Sentencing Reform Act of 1984\nfederal sentencing system), the Sixth Amendment permits\nthe court to base the sentence on its own factual findings.\nSee id., at 481; Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 305\n(2004); Booker, supra, at 233; see also Harris v. United\nStates, 536 U. S. 545, 558 (2002).1\n  Applying this rule, the Booker Court unanimously\nagreed that judicial factfinding under a purely advisory\nguidelines system would likewise comport with the Sixth\nAmendment. Writing for the five Justices who struck\ndown the mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines sys\ntem, JUSTICE STEVENS stated:\n       “If the Guidelines as currently written could be read\n     as merely advisory provisions that recommended,\n     rather than required, the selection of particular sen\n——————\n   1 The Court’s recognition of this is hardly surprising since, as Judge\n\nMcConnell has pointed out, “fully discretionary sentencing . . . was the\nsystem [that was] in place when the Sixth Amendment was adopted”\nand that “prevailed in the federal courts from the Founding until\nenactment of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 . . . without anyone\never suggesting a conflict with the Sixth Amendment.” McConnell, The\nBooker Mess, 83 Denver U. L. Rev. 665, 679 (2006). Indeed, the origi\nnal federal criminal statute enacted by the First Congress set forth\nindeterminate sentencing ranges for a variety of offenses, leaving the\ndetermination of the precise sentence to the judge’s discretion. See,\ne.g., Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, §2, 1 Stat. 112 (crime of misprision of\ntreason punishable by imprisonment not exceeding seven years and\nfine not exceeding $1,000); §6, id., at 113 (crime of misprision of a\nfelony punishable by imprisonment not exceeding three years and fine\nnot exceeding $500); §15, id., at 115–116 (crime of falsifying federal\nrecords punishable by imprisonment not exceeding seven years, fine not\nexceeding $5,000, and whipping not exceeding 39 stripes); see generally\nLittle & Chen, The Lost History of Apprendi and the Blakely Petition\nfor Rehearing, 17 Fed.

We have\n     never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise\n     broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a\n     statutory range. . . . For when a trial judge exercises\n     his discretion to select a specific sentence within a de\n     fined range, the defendant has no right to a jury de\n     termination of the facts that the judge deems rele\n     vant.” Booker, supra, at 233.2\n   In a similar vein, the remedial portion of the Court’s\nopinion in Booker, written by JUSTICE BREYER, held that\nthe Sixth Amendment permits a system of advisory guide\nlines with reasonableness review.3 JUSTICE BREYER’s\nopinion avoided a blanket invalidation of the Guidelines\nby excising the provision of the Sentencing Reform Act, 18\nU. S. C. §3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), that required a\nsentencing judge to impose a sentence within the applica\nble Guidelines range. See Booker, 543 U. S., at 259. As\nJUSTICE BREYER explained, “the existence of §3553(b)(1) is\na necessary condition of the constitutional violation. That\nis to say, without this provision . . . the statute falls out\nside the scope of Apprendi’s requirement.” Ibid.\n   Under the post-Booker federal sentencing system, “[t]he\n——————\n  2 The  four Justices who would have upheld the constitutionality of the\nmandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines system did not, of course,\ndisagree with this basic point. Indeed, they were of the view that\n“[h]istory does not support a ‘right to jury trial’ in respect to sentencing\nfacts.” Booker, 543 U. S., at 328 (BREYER, J., dissenting in part).\n  3 While the dissenters from the remedial portion of the Court’s opin\n\nion disagreed with JUSTICE BREYER’s severablity analysis, they did not\nsuggest that the resulting “advisory Guidelines” structure was uncon\nstitutional. Rather, they recognized—as JUSTICE STEVENS explained in\nhis portion of the Court’s opinion—that “[i]f the Guidelines as currently\nwritten could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended,\nrather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response\nto differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth\nAmendment.” Id., at 233.\n4              CUNNINGHAM v.

In addition, sentencing\ncourts must take account of the general sentencing goals\nset forth by Congress, including avoiding unwarranted\nsentencing disparities, providing restitution to victims,\nreflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect\nfor the law, providing just punishment, affording adequate\ndeterrence, protecting the public, and effectively providing\nthe defendant with needed educational or vocational train\ning and medical care. See id., at 260 (citing 18 U. S. C.\n§3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV)).\n   It is significant that Booker, while rendering the Guide\nlines advisory, did not reinstitute the pre-Guidelines\nfederal sentencing system, under which “well-established\ndoctrine bar[red] review of the exercise of sentencing\ndiscretion” within the broad sentencing ranges imposed by\nthe criminal statutes. Dorszynski v. United States, 418\nU. S. 424, 443 (1974). Rather, Booker conditioned a dis\ntrict court’s sentencing discretion on appellate review for\n“reasonableness” in light of the Guidelines and the\n§3553(a) factors. See Booker, supra, at 261 (“Section\n3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors\nthat guide sentencing. Those factors in turn will guide\nappellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining\nwhether a sentence is unreasonable”).\n   Although the Booker Court did not spell out in detail\nhow sentencing judges are to proceed under the new advi\nsory Guidelines regime, it seems clear that this regime\npermits—and, indeed, requires—sentencing judges to\nmake factual findings and to base their sentences on those\nfindings. The federal criminal statutes generally set out\nwide sentencing ranges, and thus in each case a sentenc\ning judge must use some criteria in selecting the sentence\nto be imposed. In doing this, federal judges have generally\nmade and relied upon factual determinations about the\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                   5\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nnature of the offense and the offender—and it is impossi\nble to imagine how federal judges could reasonably carry\nout their sentencing responsibilities without making such\nfactual determinations.\n  Under the mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines\nregime, these factual determinations were relatively for\nmal and precise. (For example, a trial judge under that\nregime might have found based on a post-trial proceeding\nthat a drug offense involved six kilograms of cocaine or\nthat the loss caused by a mail fraud offense was $2.5\nmillion.) By contrast, under the pre-Sentencing Reform\nAct federal system, the factual determinations were often\nrelatively informal and imprecise. (A trial judge might\nhave concluded from the presentence report that an of\nfense involved “a large quantity of drugs” or that a mail\nfraud scheme caused “a great loss.”) Under both systems,\nhowever, the judges made factual determinations about\nthe nature of the offense and the offender and determined\nthe sentence accordingly. And as the Courts of Appeals\nhave unanimously concluded, the post-Booker federal\nsentencing regime also permits trial judges to make such\nfactual findings and to rely on those findings in selecting\nthe sentences that are appropriate in particular cases.4\n  Under the post-Booker system, if a defendant believes\n——————\n  4 Every Court of Appeals to address the issue has held that a district\n\ncourt sentencing post-Booker may rely on facts found by the judge by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See United States v. Kilby, 443 F. 3d\n1135, 1141 (CA9 2006); United States v. Cooper, 437 F. 3d 324, 330\n(CA3 2006); United States v. Vaughn, 430 F. 3d 518, 525–526 (CA2\n2005); United States v.

CALIFORNIA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthat his or her sentence was based on an erroneous factual\ndetermination, it seems clear that the defendant may\nchallenge that finding on appeal. As noted, the post-\nBooker system permits a defendant to obtain appellate\nreview of the reasonableness of a sentence, and a sentence\nthat the sentencing court justifies solely on the basis of an\nerroneous finding of fact can hardly be regarded as rea\nsonable. Thus, under the post-Booker system, there will\nbe cases—and, in all likelihood, a good many cases—in\nwhich the question whether a defendant will be required\nto serve a greater or lesser sentence depends on whether a\ncourt of appeals sustains a finding of fact made by the\nsentencing judge.\n  A simple example illustrates this point. Suppose that a\ndefendant is found guilty of 10 counts of mail fraud in that\nthe defendant made 10 mailings in furtherance of a\nscheme to defraud. See 18 U. S. C. §1341 (2000 ed., Supp.\nIV). Under the mail fraud statute, the district court would\nhave discretion to sentence the defendant to any sentence\nranging from probation up to 200 years of imprisonment (20\nyears on each count). Suppose that the sentencing judge\nimposes the maximum sentence allowed by statute—200\nyears of imprisonment—without identifying a single fact\nabout the offense or the offender as a justification for this\nlengthy sentence. Surely that would be an unreasonable\nsentence that could not be sustained on appeal.\n  Suppose, alternatively, that the sentencing court finds\nthat the mail fraud scheme caused a loss of $1 million and\nthat the victims were elderly people of limited means, and\nsuppose that the court, based on these findings, imposes a\nsentence of 10 years of imprisonment. If the defendant\nchallenges the sentence on appeal on the ground that\nthese findings are erroneous, the question whether the\ndefendant will be required to serve 10 years or some lesser\nsentence may well depend on the validity of the district\ncourt’s findings of fact.\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                   7\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Booker, then, approved a sentencing system that (1)\nrequires a sentencing judge to “consult” and “take into\naccount” legislatively defined sentencing factors and\nguidelines; (2) subjects a sentencing judge’s exercise of\nsentencing discretion to appellate review for “reasonable\nness”; and (3) requires sentencing judges to make factual\nfindings in order to support the exercise of this discretion.\n                              II\n   The California sentencing law that the Court strikes\ndown today is not meaningfully different from the federal\nscheme upheld in Booker.\n   As an initial matter, the California law gives a judge at\nleast as much sentencing discretion as does the post-\nBooker federal scheme. California’s system of sentencing\ntriads and separate “enhancements”5 was enacted to\nachieve sentences “in proportion to the seriousness of the\noffense as determined by the Legislature to be imposed by\nthe court with specified discretion.” Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n§1170(a)(1) (West Supp. 2006). This “specified discretion”\nis quite broad. Under the statute, a sentencing court\n“shall order imposition of the middle term” of the base-\nterm triad, “unless there are circumstances in aggravation\nor mitigation of the crime.” §1170(b). While the court may\nnot rely on any fact that is an essential element of the\ncrime or of a proven enhancement, the “sentencing judge\nretains considerable discretion to identify aggravating\nfactors.” People v. Black, 35 Cal. 4th 1238, 1247, 113 P. 3d\n534, 538 (2005).\n   In exercising its sentencing discretion, a California court\ncan look to any of the 16 specific aggravating circum\nstances, see Cal. Rule of Court (Criminal Cases) 4.421\n(West 2006), or 15 specific mitigating circumstances, see\n——————\n  5 These enhancements, which add additional years onto the base-triad\n\nterm selected by the court, see ante, at 7–8, must be pleaded and proved\nto a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. They are not at issue in this case.\n8                  CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nRule 4.423, itemized in the California Rules of Court. A\nCalifornia trial court can also consider the “[g]eneral\nobjectives of sentencing,” including protecting society,\npunishing the defendant, encouraging the defendant to\nlead a law-abiding life and deterring the defendant from\ncommitting future offenses, deterring others from criminal\nconduct by demonstrating its consequences, preventing\nthe defendant from committing new crimes by means of\nincarceration, securing restitution for crime victims, and\nachieving uniformity in sentencing.6 Rule 4.410(a). And if\na California trial court finds that its sentencing authority\nis unduly restricted by these factors, which the California\nSupreme Court has recognized “are largely the articula\ntion of considerations sentencing judges have always used\nin making these decisions,” People v. Hernandez, 46 Cal.\n3d 194, 205, 757 P. 2d 1013, 1019, (1988) (in bank), over\nruled on other grounds, People v.

S. C. §3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which directs a court to\nconsider, among other things, the need to promote respect for the law,\nto provide just punishment for the offense, to afford adequate deter\nrence to criminal conduct and to protect the public.\n  7 As the California Supreme Court explained in Black,\n\n  “In adopting the sentencing rules, the Judicial Council considered\nand rejected proposals that the rules provide an exclusive list of sen\ntencing criteria and that the criteria be assigned specific weights, on\nthe ground that the Legislature intended to give the sentencing judge\ndiscretion in selecting among the lower, middle, and upper terms.

Indeed, as one California court has explained,\nsentencing discretion may even be guided by a “judge’s\nsubjective determination of . . . the appropriate aggregate\nsentence” based on his “experiences with prior cases and\nthe record in the defendant’s case.” People v.

Even when a\ncourt imposes the “presumptive” middle term, its decision\nis reviewable for abuse of discretion—that is, its decision\nto sentence at the “standard” term must be reasonable.\nSee People v. Cattaneo, 217 Cal. App. 3d 1577, 1587–1588,\n266 Cal. Rptr. 710, 716 (1990).\n   Moreover, the California system, like the post-Booker\nfederal regime, recognizes that a sentencing judge must\nhave the ability to look at all the relevant facts—even\nthose outside the trial record and jury verdict—in exercis\ning his or her discretion. “The judicial factfinding that\noccurs during that selection process is the same type of\njudicial factfinding that traditionally has been a part of\nthe sentencing process.” Black, supra, at 1258, 113 P. 3d,\nat 545.\n                             III\n  Despite these similarities between the California system\nand the “advisory Guidelines” scheme approved in Booker,\n——————\nCourt.

S. ____ (2007)           11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthe Court nevertheless holds that the California regime\nruns afoul of the Sixth Amendment. The Court reasons as\nfollows: (1) California requires that some aggravating fact,\napart from the elements of the offense found by the jury,\nmust support an upper term sentence; (2) Blakely defined\nthe “statutory maximum” to be “the maximum sentence a\njudge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected\nin the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant,” 542 U. S.,\nat 303 (emphasis in original); and therefore (3) the Cali\nfornia regime violates “Apprendi’s bright-line rule,” id., at\n308, that “any fact that increases the penalty for a crime\nbeyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be sub\nmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nApprendi, 530 U. S., at 490.\n   This argument is flawed. For one thing, it is not at all\nclear that a California court must find some case-specific,\nadjudicative “fact” (as opposed to identifying a relevant\npolicy consideration) before imposing an upper term sen\ntence. What a California sentencing court must find is a\n“circumstanc[e] in aggravation,” Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n§1170(b) (emphasis added), which, California’s Court\nRules make clear, can include any “criteria reasonably\nrelated to the decision being made.” Rule 4.408(a).\n   California courts are thus empowered to take into ac\ncount the full panoply of factual and policy considerations\nthat have traditionally been considered by judges operat\ning under fully discretionary sentencing regimes—the\nconstitutionality of which the Court has repeatedly reaf\nfirmed. California law explicitly authorizes a sentencing\ncourt to take into account, for example, broad sentencing\nobjectives like punishment, deterrence, restitution, and\nuniformity, see Rule 4.410, and even a judge’s “subjective\nbelief” as to the appropriateness of the sentence, see Ste\nvens, supra, at 1457, 253 Cal. Rptr., at 177, as long as the\n12                 CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfinal result is reasonable.9 Policy considerations like these\nhave always been outside the province of the jury and do\nnot implicate the Sixth Amendment concerns expressed in\nApprendi.\n   In short, the requirement that a California court find\nsome “circumstanc[e] in aggravation” before imposing an\nupper term sentence is not the same as a requirement that\nit find an aggravating fact. And if a California sentencing\ncourt need not find a fact beyond those “reflected in the\njury verdict or admitted by the defendant,” Blakely, supra,\nat 303 (emphasis deleted), then Apprendi’s “bright-line\nrule” plainly does not apply.10\n   But even if the California law did require that a sen\n\n——————\n   9 The State of California acknowledged in its brief that “[t]he court\n\ncan rely on essentially any reason placing the defendant’s particular\noffense outside the mean when selecting” which term of the triad to\nimpose. Brief for Respondent 32. As California’s counsel acknowledged\nat oral argument, a concern for deterrence in light of an uptick in crime\nin a particular community, for example, could be a “circumstance in\naggravation” supporting imposition of an upper term sentence under\nCalifornia law, even though that concern is not based on judge-found,\ncase-specific facts. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–40.\n   10 It is true that California’s Court Rules also itemize more concrete\n\naggravating circumstances that they label “[f]acts relating to the crime”\nand “[f]acts relating to the defendant.” See Cal. Rules of Court (Crimi\nnal Cases) 4.421 and 4.423 (West 2006). But these lists are not exhaus\ntive, and they do not impair a court’s ability to take into account more\ngeneral sentencing objectives in deciding whether to sentence a defen\ndant to the upper term. The Rules’ provision that “[c]ircumstances in\naggravation and mitigation shall be established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence,” Rule 4.420(b), is clearly meant to cover the types of\ncrime- and defendant-specific adjudicative facts set forth in the Rules\nimmediately following; there is nothing to suggest that this provision\nexcludes consideration of more general sentencing objectives that are\nnot conducive to such trial-type proof. As the Rules explicitly recognize,\nthese different categories of sentencing considerations are not mutually\nexclusive. See Rule 4.410(b) (“The sentencing judge should be guided\nby statutory statements of policy, the criteria in these rules, and the\nfacts and circumstances of the case”).\n                     Cite as: 549 U.

As previ\nously explained, the “advisory Guidelines,” bounded by\nreasonableness review, effectively (albeit less explicitly)\nimpose the same requirement on federal judges. Booker’s\nreasonableness review necessarily supposes that some\nsentences will be unreasonable in the absence of addi\ntional facts justifying them. (Recall the prior hypothetical\ncase in which it was posited that the district court imposed\na sentence of 200 years of imprisonment for mail fraud\nwithout citing a single aggravating fact about the offense\nor the offender.) Thus, although the post-Booker Guide\nlines are labeled “advisory,” reasonableness review im\nposes a very real constraint on a judge’s ability to sentence\nacross the full statutory range without finding some ag\ngravating fact.11\n   The Court downplays the significance of Booker reason\nableness review on the ground that Booker-style “reason\nableness . . . operates within the Sixth Amendment con\n——————\n  11 The  Court believes that in order to reach this conclusion, I must\n“previe[w] . . . how ‘reasonableness review,’ post-Booker, works,” ante,\nat 15, n. 13, and perhaps even prejudge this Court’s forthcoming\ndecisions in Rita and Claiborne, ante, at 20, n. 15. But my point is\nmuch more modest. We need not map all the murky contours of the\npost-Booker landscape in order to conclude that reasonableness review\nmust mean something. If reasonableness review is more than just an\nempty exercise, there inevitably will be some sentences that, absent any\njudge-found aggravating fact, will be unreasonable. One need not\nembrace any presumption of reasonableness or unreasonableness to\naccept this simple point. If this is the case—and I cannot see how it is\nnot, given the Court’s endorsement of reasonableness review in\nBooker—then there is no meaningful Sixth Amendment difference\nbetween California’s sentencing system and the post-Booker \"advisory\nGuidelines.\" Under both, a sentencing judge operating under a reason\nableness constraint must find facts beyond the jury’s verdict in order to\njustify the imposition of at least some sentences at the high end of the\nstatutory range.\n14              CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nstraints delineated in our precedent, not as a substitute\nfor those constraints.” Ante, at 20 (emphasis in original).\nBut this begs the question, which concerns the scope of\nthose “Sixth Amendment constraints.” That question is\nanswered by the Court’s remedial holding in Booker,\nwhich necessarily stands for the proposition that it is\nconsistent with the Sixth Amendment for the imposition of\nan enhanced sentence to be conditioned on a factual find\ning made by a sentencing judge and not by a jury.\n   The Court relies heavily on Blakely’s admonition that\n“the ‘statutory maximum’ for Apprendi purposes is the\nmaximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis\nof the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the\ndefendant.” 542 U. S., at 303 (emphasis in original). But\nthe Court fails to recognize how this statement must be\nunderstood in the wake of Booker.\n   For each statutory offense, there must be a sentence\nthat represents the least onerous sentence that can be\nregarded as reasonable in light of the bare statutory ele\nments found by the jury. To return to our prior example of\na mail fraud offense, there must be some sentence that\nrepresents the least onerous sentence that would be ap\npropriate in a case in which the statutory elements of mail\nfraud are satisfied but in which the offense and the of\nfender are as little deserving of punishment as can be\nimagined. (Whether this sentence is the statutory mini\nmum (probation, see 18 U. S. C. §1341 (2000 ed., Supp.\nIV)) or the minimum under the advisory Guidelines (also\nprobation, see United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual §2B1.1 and Sentencing Table (Nov.\n2006)) is irrelevant for present purposes; what is relevant\nis that there must be some minimum reasonable sentence.)\nThis sentence is “the maximum sentence” that could rea\nsonably be imposed “solely on the basis of the facts re\nflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.”\nBlakely, supra, at 303 (emphasis deleted).\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           15\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Booker’s reasonableness review necessarily anticipates\nthat the imposition of sentences above this level may be\nconditioned upon findings of fact made by a judge and not\nby the jury. Booker held that a system of “advisory Guide\nlines” with reasonableness review is consistent with the\nSixth Amendment, and the same analysis should govern\nCalifornia’s “requirement that the decision to impose the\nupper term be reasonable.” Black, 35 Cal. 4th, at 1255, 113\nP. 3d, at 544 (emphasis in original). That the California\nrequirement is explicit, while the federal aggravating\nfactor requirement is (at least for now) implicit, should not\nbe constitutionally dispositive.\n   Unless the Court is prepared to overrule the remedial\ndecision in Booker, the California sentencing scheme at\nissue in this case should be held to be consistent with the\nSixth Amendment. I would therefore affirm the decision\nof the California Court of Appeal.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145761/", "sha1": "b922e9147decf1cc43fd687389949dd5504e398c", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2006-014", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:07:20"}
