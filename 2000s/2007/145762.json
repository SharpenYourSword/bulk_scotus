Thomas Miller, Counsel of Record, J. Duncan Pitchford, Richard C. Roberts, Whitlow, Roberts, Houston &amp; Straub, PLLC, Paducah, KY, Counsel for Respondents.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, commonly known as the Westfall Act, accords federal employees absolute immunity from common-law tort claims arising out of acts they undertake in the course of their official duties. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(1). When a federal employee is sued for wrongful or negligent conduct, the Act empowers the Attorney General to certify that the employee \"was acting within the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*888</span> scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.\" \u00a7 2679(d)(1), (2). Upon the Attorney General's certification, the employee is dismissed from the action, and the United States is substituted as defendant in place of the employee. The litigation is thereafter governed by the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 60 Stat. 842. If the action commenced in state court, the case is to be removed to a federal district court, and the certification remains \"conclusiv[e] ... for purposes of removal.\" \u00a7 2679(d)(2).</p>\n<p>In <i>Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno,</i> 515 U.S. 417, 420, 115 S.Ct. 2227, 132 L.Ed.2d 375 (1995), we held that the Attorney General's Westfall Act scope-of-employment certification is subject to judicial review. Today, we address three further questions regarding the Westfall Act's operation: (1) Is Attorney General certification proper when a federal officer denies the occurrence of the tortious conduct alleged by the plaintiff; (2) does \u00a7 2679(d)(2), by rendering the Attorney General's certification \"conclusiv[e] ... for purposes of removal,\" bar remand even if the federal court determines that the United States should not be substituted as defendant in place of the federal employee; and (3) does 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)'s bar on appellate review of remand orders override \u00a7 2679(d)(2)'s direction that, for purposes of removal, the Attorney General's certification is conclusive. The first two questions were advanced in the petition for certiorari; in our order granting review, we asked the parties to address the impact of \u00a7 1447(d) on this case.</p>\n<p>Pat Osborn, plaintiff-petitioner in the civil action now before the Court, sued federal employee Barry Haley in a Kentucky state court. She alleged that Haley tortiously interfered with her employment with a private contractor and conspired to cause her wrongful discharge. Osborn further alleged that Haley's efforts to bring about her discharge were outside the scope of his employment. The United States Attorney, serving as the Attorney General's delegate, countered Osborn's allegations by certifying that Haley \"was acting within the scope of his employment... at the time of the conduct alleged in [Osborn's] complaint.\" App. to Brief in Opposition 23 (hereinafter Luber App.). Based on this certification, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, as \u00a7 2679(d)(2) instructs.</p>\n<p>In the federal forum, the United States Attorney denied the tortious conduct Osborn attributed to Haley, asserting that the wrongdoing she alleged never occurred. Accepting Osborn's allegations as true, the District Court entered an order that rejected the Attorney General's Westfall Act certification, denied the Government's motion to substitute the United States as defendant in place of Haley, and remanded the case to the state court. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit vacated the District Court's order, and instructed that court to retain jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p>We affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment. On the merits, we agree with the Sixth Circuit that the District Court, in denying substitution of the United States as defendant in lieu of Haley, misconstrued the Westfall Act. Substitution of the United States is not improper simply because the Attorney General's certification rests on an understanding of the facts that differs from the plaintiff's allegations. The United States, we hold, must remain the federal defendant in the action unless and until the District Court determines that the employee, <i>in fact,</i> and not simply as alleged by the plaintiff, engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment. On the jurisdictional issues, we hold that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*889</span> for purposes of removal, <i>i.e.,</i> once certification and removal are effected, exclusive competence to adjudicate the case resides in the federal court, and that court may not remand the suit to the state court. We also hold that \u00a7 1447(d)'s bar on appellate review of remand orders does not displace \u00a7 2679(d)(2), which shields from remand an action removed pursuant to the Attorney General's certification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Pat Osborn worked for Land Between the Lakes Association (LBLA), a private company that contracted with the United States Forest Service to provide staff for the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area in Kentucky.<sup>[1]</sup> While employed by LBLA, Osborn applied for a trainee position with the Forest Service. Respondent Barry Haley, a Forest Service officer, was responsible for the Service's hiring process. At a meeting with LBLA employees, Haley announced that he had hired someone else for the job Osborn sought. Osborn asked why Haley did not inform her before the meeting, and she made a joke at Haley's expense. After the meeting, Osborn's supervisor told her to apologize to Haley; she refused.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, Osborn filed a complaint with the United States Department of Labor, asking the Department to investigate whether the Forest Service, in its hiring decision, had given appropriate consideration to the veterans' preference points to which she was entitled. The Department's investigator, Robert Kuenzli, after interviewing Haley, concluded that the hiring procedure had been handled correctly. Kuenzli so informed Osborn, who then asked him to close her complaint. On the same day LBLA's executive director, respondent Gaye Luber, summoned Osborn and demanded that she apologize to Haley for \"not being a good Forest Service partner.\" Complaint \u00b6 18, Luber App. 4. Osborn again refused. Two days later, she was fired.</p>\n<p>Osborn filed suit against Haley, Luber, and LBLA in a Kentucky state court. She alleged that Haley tortiously interfered with her employment relationship with LBLA and conspired to cause her wrongful discharge. Specifically, she charged that Haley maliciously induced Luber to fire her, and that Haley did so in retaliation for Osborn's Department of Labor complaint requesting a veterans' preference inquiry. Complaint \u00b6 29, Luber App. 7. In response the local United States Attorney, invoking the Westfall Act, certified on behalf of the Attorney General that Haley \"was acting within the scope of his employment with the U.S. Forest Service at the time of the conduct alleged in [Osborn's] complaint.\" Luber App. 23. As is customary, the certification stated no reasons for the determination.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In the Westfall Act, Congress instructed:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Upon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*890</span> was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a State court shall be removed without bond at any time before trial by the Attorney General to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place in which the action or proceeding is pending. Such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be an action or proceeding brought against the United States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant. <i>This certification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.</i>\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>Citing this provision, as well as the federal officer removal statute, \u00a7 1442,<sup>[3]</sup> the United States removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. The United States Attorney notified the District Court that the United States should be substituted for Haley as defendant, and filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that Osborn had not exhausted administrative remedies, as required by the FTCA.</p>\n<p>Osborn opposed the substitution and the motion to dismiss. She argued that Haley's conduct was outside the scope of his employment, hence the Westfall Act afforded him no immunity. As support for her opposition, Osborn submitted a memorandum of understanding between the LBLA and the Forest Service, which cautioned Forest Service employees against involvement in LBLA employment decisions.</p>\n<p>Apparently under the impression that the United States, at that preliminary stage, did not dispute Osborn's factual allegations, the District Court declined to conduct an evidentiary hearing. Under Kentucky law, the court observed, if Osborn's allegations were true, Haley had acted outside the scope of his employment. In the District Court's view the closeness in time of Osborn's request for a Department of Labor investigation, Kuenzli's call to Haley, and Luber's demand for an apology justified an inference that Haley interfered with Osborn's employment in violation of the LBLA-Forest Service memorandum of understanding. So reasoning, the District Court overruled the Westfall Act certification and denied substitution. Under this ruling, the United States was no longer before the court. Furthermore, the parties were not of diverse citizenship and no federal law was at issue. The District Court therefore held that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case.<sup>[4]</sup> Invoking \u00a7 1447(c),<sup>[5]</sup> the court concluded that the case must be remanded to the state court.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*891</span> The United States moved for reconsideration, urging that, contrary to the District Court's impression, the Government did contest Osborn's factual allegations. Recalling that it had denied Osborn's allegations in its answer to her complaint, the United States submitted sworn declarations from Haley and Luber. Haley's stated that he was not in communication with Luber between the time of Kuenzli's investigation and Osborn's firing. Luber's declaration stated that Osborn's request for an investigation regarding her veterans' preference points could not have had any bearing on Osborn's termination, for Luber was unaware of the request at the relevant time. Absent contrary evidence, the Government maintained, these declarations sufficed to support the certification and the continuance of the United States as defendant in place of Haley. In the alternative, the Government sought discovery.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The District Court denied the Government's reconsideration motion. The Haley and Luber declarations, the court said, clarified that the controversy centered on whether there had been any communication between Haley and Luber influencing Luber's decision to fire Osborn. The Westfall Act would have shielded Haley, the Court suggested, had the United States admitted a Haley-Luber communication but defended its content as within the scope of Haley's employment. Westfall Act certification was improper, the court concluded, because the United States did not admit, but instead denied, the occurrence of the event central to proof of Osborn's claim. The District Court acknowledged disagreement among the Circuits on the availability of a Westfall Act certification when the United States \"den[ies] the occurrence of the basic incident charged.\" <i>Wood v. United States,</i> 995 F.2d 1122, 1124 (C.A.1 1993) (en banc). Compare <i>ibid.</i> and <i>McHugh v. University of Vermont,</i> 966 F.2d 67, 74-75 (C.A.2 1992) (prohibiting incident-denying certifications), with <i>Heuton v. Anderson,</i> 75 F.3d 357, 360 (C.A.8 1996); <i>Kimbro v. Velten,</i> 30 F.3d 1501, 1508 (C.A.D.C.1994); and <i>Melo v. Hafer,</i> 13 F.3d 736, 746-747 (C.A.3 1994) (allowing incident-denying certifications). Choosing to follow the First Circuit's opinion in <i>Wood,</i> the District Court adhered to its prior ruling that the Westfall Act certification in this case was invalid.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Sixth Circuit vacated the District Court's order denying certification and substitution. 422 F.3d 359, 365 (2005). The Court of Appeals, in accord with <i>Heuton, Kimbro,</i> and <i>Melo,</i> held that a Westfall Act certification is not improper simply because the United States denies the occurrence of the incident on which the plaintiff centrally relies. 422 F.3d, at 364. Rather, the court held, where \"the Attorney General's certification is based on a different understanding of the facts than is reflected in the complaint, including a denial of the harm-causing incident, the district court must resolve the factual dispute.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*892</span> <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Melo,</i> 13 F.3d, at 747).</p>\n<p>The Sixth Circuit also vacated the District Court's order remanding the case to the state court. Section 2679(d)(2), the Court of Appeals stressed, instructs that the \"certification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.\" The court read that instruction to proscribe shuttling cases back to state courts and, instead, to require district court adjudication of the controversy even when a Westfall Act certification is rejected and, correspondingly, substitution of the United States as defendant is denied. 422 F.3d, at 365. On that issue too, the Court of Appeals noted a division among the Circuits. Compare <i>Borneman v. United States,</i> 213 F.3d 819, 826 (C.A.4 2000); <i>Garcia v. United States,</i> 88 F.3d 318, 325-327 (C.A.5 1996); and <i>Aliota v. Graham,</i> 984 F.2d 1350, 1356 (C.A.3 1993) (holding that a district court lacks authority to remand a case removed under \u00a7 2679(d)(2)), with <i>Haddon v. United States,</i> 68 F.3d 1420, 1427 (C.A.D.C.1995); and <i>Nasuti v. Scannell,</i> 906 F.2d 802, 814, n. 17 (C.A.1 1990) (holding remand proper when district court rejects the Attorney General's certification). We granted certiorari. 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2017, 164 L.Ed.2d 778 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We consider first the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction to review the District Court's disposition of this case. We address in turn the questions whether the appellate court had jurisdiction to review (1) the order rejecting the Attorney General's certification and denying substitution of the United States as defendant, and (2) the order remanding the case to the state court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The District Court's rejection of certification and substitution effectively denied Haley the protection afforded by the Westfall Act, a measure designed to immunize covered federal employees not simply from liability, but from suit. See \u00a7 2(a)(5), 102 Stat. 4563; <i>Lamagno,</i> 515 U.S., at 425-426, 115 S.Ct. 2227; H.R.Rep. No. 100-700, p. 4 (1988), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 1988, p. 5945. Under the collateral order doctrine of <i>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,</i> 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), this ruling qualifies as a reviewable final decision within the compass of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Meeting the three criteria of <i>Cohen,</i> the District Court's denial of certification and substitution conclusively decided a contested issue, the issue decided is important and separate from the merits of the action, and the District Court's disposition would be effectively unreviewable later in the litigation. 337 U.S., at 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221. See <i>Mitchell v. Forsyth,</i> 472 U.S. 511, 525-527, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (holding that district court rejection of a defendant's qualified immunity plea is immediately appealable under the <i>Cohen</i> doctrine because suit immunity \"is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial\" against the immune official). As cogently explained by the Fifth Circuit in <i>Mitchell v. Carlson,</i> 896 F.2d 128, 133 (1990), retaining the federal employee as a party defendant</p>\n<blockquote>\"effectively denie[s][him] immunity from suit if [he] was entitled to such immunity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*893</span> under the Westfall Act. Under the Act, once the United States Attorney certifies that the federal employee acted within the scope of [his] employment, the plaintiff properly can proceed only against the United States as defendant. The federal employee remains immune from suit. By [rejecting the Attorney Genera's certification], the district court subject[s] [the employee] to the burden of defending a suit . . ., a burden from which [the Westfall Act spares him].\"</blockquote>\n<p>Tellingly, the Courts of Appeals are unanimous in holding that orders denying Westfall Act certification and substitution are amenable to immediate review under <i>Cohen.</i> See <i>Woodruff v. Covington,</i> 389 F.3d 1117, 1124 (C.A.10 2004); <i>Mathis v. Henderson,</i> 243 F.3d 446, 448 (C.A.8 2001); <i>Borneman,</i> 213 F.3d, at 826 (C.A.4); <i>Lyons v. Brown,</i> 158 F.3d 605, 607 (C.A.1 1998); <i>Taboas v. Mlynczak,</i> 149 F.3d 576, 579 (C.A.7 1998); <i>Coleman v. United States,</i> 91 F.3d 820, 823 (C.A.6 1996); <i>Flohr v. Mackovjak,</i> 84 F.3d 386, 390 (C.A.11 1996); <i>Kimbro,</i> 30 F.3d, at 1503 (C.A.D.C.); <i>Aliota,</i> 984 F.2d, at 1354 (C.A.3); <i>Pelletier v. Federal Home Loan Bank,</i> 968 F.2d 865, 873 (C.A.9 1992); <i>McHugh,</i> 966 F.2d, at 69 (C.A.2); <i>Carlson,</i> 896 F.2d, at 133 (C.A.5). We confirm that the Courts of Appeals have ruled correctly on this matter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In our order granting certiorari we asked the parties to address, in addition to the issues presented in the petition, this further question: Did the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction to review the District Court's remand order, notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)'s declaration that \"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise\"? In answering this question, we also resolve the second question presented in the petition for certiorari\u0097whether the Westfall Act's rule against remanding actions removed pursuant to \u00a7 2679(d)(2) applies when the federal court determines that the United States should not be substituted as defendant in place of the federal employee. Our disposition is informed by, and tracks, the Third Circuit's reasoning in <i>Aliota,</i> 984 F.2d, at 1354-1357.</p>\n<p>We begin with the provision we asked the parties to address: \u00a7 1447(d). That provision states in relevant part: \"An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise. . . .\" In <i>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer,</i> 423 U.S. 336, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976), we held that the preceding subsection, \u00a7 1447(c), confined \u00a7 1447(d)'s scope. Under \u00a7 1447(d), the Court explained, \"only remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the [mandatory] grounds specified therein\u0097that removal was improvident and without jurisdiction\u0097 are immune from review.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 346, 96 S.Ct. 584.<sup>[8]</sup><i>Thermtron</i> had been properly removed to the federal court. The sole reason the District Court gave for remanding it was that court's crowded docket. This Court held the remand order reviewable, observing that \u00a7 1447(c) could not sensibly be read to confer on the district courts \"carte blanche authority . . . to revise the federal statutes governing removal.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 351, 96 S.Ct. 584. See also <i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 517 U.S. 706, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*894</span> (holding abstention-based remand order immediately appealable). But see <i>Gravitt v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.,</i> 430 U.S. 723, 97 S.Ct. 1439, 52 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977) <i>(per curiam)</i> (holding unreviewable a remand order purporting to rest on a ground within the scope of \u00a7 1447(c)).</p>\n<p>The United States urges us to apply <i>Thermtron</i> and hold the remand order in this case reviewable because that order was not based on a ground specified in \u00a7 1447(c). To determine whether <i>Thermtron</i> controls, we must start with an examination of the Westfall Act's design, particularly its prescriptions regarding the removal and remand of actions filed in state court.</p>\n<p>As earlier noted, see <i>supra,</i> at 887-888, the Act grants the Attorney General authority to certify that a federal employee named defendant in a tort action was acting within the scope of his or her employment at the time in question. \u00a7 2679(d)(1), (2). If the action is commenced in a federal court, and the Attorney General certifies that the employee \"was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the [relevant] time,\" the United States must be substituted as the defendant. \u00a7 2679(d)(1). If the action is launched in a state court, and the Attorney General makes the same certification, the action \"shall be removed\" to the appropriate federal district court, and again the United States must be substituted as the defendant. \u00a7 2679(d)(2). Of prime importance to our decision, \u00a7 2679(d)(2) concludes with the command: \"Th[e] certification of the Attorney General shall <i>conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.</i>\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>This directive markedly differs from Congress' instruction for cases in which the Attorney General \"refuse[s] to certify scope of office or employment.\" \u00a7 2679(d)(3). In that event, the defendant employee may petition the court in which the action was instituted to make the scope-of-employment certification. If the complaint was filed in a state court, the Attorney General <i>may</i> remove the case to the appropriate federal court, but he is not obliged to do so. <i>Ibid.</i> If the court, state or federal, issues the certification, \"the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant.\" <i>Ibid.</i> If removal has occurred, and thereafter \"the district court determines that the employee was not acting within the scope of his office or employment, the action . . . <i>shall be remanded to the State court.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The Act's distinction between removed cases in which the Attorney General issues a scope-of-employment certification, and those in which he does not, leads us to conclude that Congress gave district courts no authority to return cases to state courts on the ground that the Attorney General's certification was unwarranted. Absent certification, \u00a7 2679(d)(3) directs that the case must be remanded to the state court in which the action commenced. In contrast, when the Attorney General certifies scope of employment, his certificate \"conclusively establish[es] scope of office or employment <i>for purposes of removal.</i>\" \u00a7 2679(d)(2) (emphasis added). Section 2679(d)(2) does not preclude a district court from resubstituting the federal official as defendant <i>for purposes of trial</i> if the court determines, postremoval, that the Attorney General's scope-of-employment certification was incorrect. For purposes of establishing a forum to adjudicate the case, however, \u00a7 2679(d)(2) renders the Attorney General's certification dispositive.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*895</span> Were it open to a district court to remand a removed action on the ground that the Attorney General's certification was erroneous, the final instruction in \u00a7 2679(d)(2) would be weightless. The Attorney General's certification would not \"conclusively establish scope of office or employment\" for either trial or removal. Instead, the Attorney General's scope certification would supply only a tentative basis for removal, rather than a conclusive one. In <i>Lamagno,</i> the Court unanimously agreed that Congress spoke unambiguously on this matter: Congress adopted the \"conclusiv[e] . . . for purposes of removal\" language to \"foreclose needless shuttling of a case from one court to another.\" 515 U.S., at 433, n. 10, 115 S.Ct. 2227; see <i>id.,</i> at 440, 115 S.Ct. 2227 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (\"[T]here is nothing equivocal about [\u00a7 2679(d)(2)'s] provision that once a state tort action has been removed to a federal court after a certification by the Attorney General, it may never be remanded to the state system.\").</p>\n<p>With the Westfall Act's provisions on removal of actions filed in state court in clear view, we return to the question whether an order remanding a case removed pursuant to \u00a7 2679(d)(2) is reviewable. <i>Thermtron</i> held that \u00a7 1447(d) must be read together with \u00a7 1447(c). There is stronger cause, we conclude, to hold that \u00a7 1447(c) and (d) must be read together with the later enacted \u00a7 2679(d)(2). Both \u00a7 1447(d) and \u00a7 2679(d)(2) are antishuttling provisions. Each aims to prevent \"prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.\" <i>United States v. Rice,</i> 327 U.S. 742, 751, 66 S.Ct. 835, 90 L.Ed. 982 (1946). Section 2679(d)(2) is operative when the Attorney General certifies scope of employment, triggering removal of the case to a federal forum. At that point, \u00a7 2679(d)(2) renders the federal court exclusively competent and categorically precludes a remand to the state court.</p>\n<p>The command that the Attorney General's certification \"shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal,\" \u00a7 2679(d)(2), differentiates certified Westfall Act cases from the typical case remanded for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. Ordinarily, when the plaintiff moves to remand a removed case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, the federal district court undertakes a threshold inquiry; typically the court determines whether complete diversity exists or whether the complaint raises a federal question. In Attorney General certified Westfall Act cases, however, no threshold determination is called for; the Attorney General's certificate forecloses any jurisdictional inquiry. By declaring the Attorney General's certification \"conclusive\" as to the federal forum's jurisdiction, Congress has barred a district court from passing the case back to the state court where it originated based on the court's disagreement with the Attorney General's scope-of-employment determination.</p>\n<p>Our decision that \u00a7 2679(d)(2) leaves the district court without authority to send a certified case back to the state court scarcely means that whenever the district court misconstrues a jurisdictional statute, appellate review of the remand is in order. Such an exception would, of course, collide <span class=\"star-pagination\">*896</span> head on with \u00a7 1447(d), and with our precedent. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca,</i> 516 U.S. 124, 127-128, 116 S.Ct. 494, 133 L.Ed.2d 461 (1995). Only in the extraordinary case in which Congress has ordered the intercourt shuttle to travel just one way\u0097from state to federal court\u0097does today's decision hold sway.</p>\n<p>In short, of the two antishuttling commands, \u00a7 1447(d) and \u00a7 2679(d)(2), only one can prevail. We hold that \u00a7 2679(d)(2) controls. Tailor-made for Westfall Act cases, \u00a7 2679(d)(2) is a forum-selecting rule Congress made \"conclusive,\" beyond the ken of district courts to revise. See <i>Thermtron,</i> 423 U.S., at 351, 96 S.Ct. 584.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In <i>Lamagno,</i> the Court considered, but did not definitively resolve, the question whether Article III permits \"[t]reating the Attorney General's certification as conclusive for purposes of removal but not for purposes of substitution.\" 515 U.S., at 434, 115 S.Ct. 2227. It was argued in that case that if certification is rejected and substitution denied \"because the federal court concludes that the employee acted outside the scope of his employment, and if the tort plaintiff and the [defendant-employee] are not of diverse citizenship, . . . then the federal court will be left with a case without a federal question to support the court's subject-matter jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 434-435, 115 S.Ct. 2227. <i>Lamagno</i> was an action commenced in federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship, so there was in that case \"not even the specter of an Article III problem.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 435, 115 S.Ct. 2227.</p>\n<p>In the case before us, the question would arise only if, after full consideration, the District Court determines that Haley in fact engaged in the tortious conduct outside the scope of his employment charged in Osborn's complaint. At that point, however, little would be left to adjudicate, at least as to Haley's liability. Because a significant federal question (whether Haley has Westfall Act immunity) would have been raised at the outset, the case would \"aris[e] under\" federal law, as that term is used in Article III. See <i>Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,</i> 461 U.S. 480, 493, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983). Even if only state-law claims remained after resolution of the federal question, the District Court would have discretion, consistent with Article III, to retain jurisdiction. See <i>Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill,</i> 484 U.S. 343, 350-351, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988) (when federal character of removed case is eliminated while the case is <i>sub judice,</i> court has discretion to retain jurisdiction, to remand, or to dismiss); cf. <i>Mine Workers v. Gibbs,</i> 383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966) (pendent jurisdiction may be exercised when federal and state claims have a \"common nucleus of operative fact\" and would \"ordinarily be expected to [be tried] all in one judicial proceeding\"). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 (\"Supplemental jurisdiction\"). \"[C]onsiderations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants,\" <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U.S., at 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, make it reasonable and proper for a federal court to proceed to final judgment, once it has invested time and resources to resolve the pivotal scope-of-employment contest. Thus, under the precedent that guides us, the Westfall Act's command that a district court retain jurisdiction over a case removed pursuant to \u00a7 2679(d)(2) does not run afoul of Article III.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>With the jurisdictional issues resolved, we reach the principal question raised by petitioner Osborn: whether the United States Attorney validly certified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*897</span> that Haley \"was acting within the scope of his employment . . . at the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint.\" Luber App. 23. We note first that the certificate is formally in order; it closely tracks the language of the Westfall Act. See \u00a7 2679(d)(2) (authorizing certification \"that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose\"). In <i>Lamagno,</i> we held that the Attorney General's certification is \"the first, but not the final word\" on whether the federal officer is immune from suit and, correlatively, whether the United States is properly substituted as defendant. 515 U.S., at 432, 115 S.Ct. 2227. A plaintiff may request judicial review of the Attorney General's scope-of-employment determination, as Osborn did here.</p>\n<p>As earlier recounted, see <i>supra,</i> at 890, the District Court initially accepted Osborn's allegations as true because it believed that the United States did not dispute them. Applying Kentucky law, that court determined that \"Haley's alleged actions occurred outside the scope of his employment.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a. In a motion for reconsideration, the Government clarified that, far from admitting Osborn's allegations, it disputed the very occurrence of the harm-causing conduct Osborn alleged. In support of the motion, the Government submitted affidavits from Haley and Luber denying that they engaged in the conduct ascribed to them in Osborn's complaint. The Government contended that Haley remained within the proper bounds of his employment at the relevant time and place because the wrongdoing Osborn alleged never happened.</p>\n<p>The Government's reconsideration motion asked the District Court to resolve the factual dispute, <i>i.e.,</i> to determine whether, as the complaint alleged, Haley prevailed upon Luber to discharge Osborn, or whether, as Haley asserted, he never communicated with Luber about Osborn's LBLA employment. The court did not grant the Government's request for resolution of the factual dispute. Instead, it held the Westfall Act certification invalid precisely because the Government denied that Haley engaged in harm-causing conduct.</p>\n<p>Two Courts of Appeals have held that Westfall Act certification is improper when the Government denies the occurrence of the alleged injury-causing action or episode. See <i>Wood,</i> 995 F.2d, at 1123 (C.A.1); <i>McHugh,</i> 966 F.2d, at 74-75 (C.A.2). The Sixth Circuit, in this case, and several other Courts of Appeals have held that a plaintiff's allegation of conduct beyond the scope of a federal official's employment does not block certification where the Government contends that the alleged tortious conduct did not occur. See <i>Heuton,</i> 75 F.3d, at 360 (C.A.8); <i>Kimbro,</i> 30 F.3d, at 1508 (C.A.D.C.); <i>Melo,</i> 13 F.3d, at 746-747 (C.A.3). We agree that Westfall Act certification is proper when a federal officer charged with misconduct asserts, and the Government determines, that the incident or episode in suit never occurred.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Westfall Act grants a federal employee suit immunity, we reiterate, when \"acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.\" \u00a7 2679(d)(1), (2). That formulation, we are persuaded, encompasses an employee on duty at the time and place of an \"incident\" alleged in a complaint who denies that the incident occurred. See <i>Wood,</i> 995 F.2d, at 1134 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting) (\"[S]urely the statute applies with the same force whether a postal service driver says that he did not hit the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*898</span> plaintiff's car or that he did so but was not at fault.\"); <i>Melo,</i> 13 F.3d, at 747. And just as the Government's certification that an employee \"was acting within the scope of his employment\" is subject to threshold judicial review, <i>Lamagno,</i> 515 U.S., at 434, 115 S.Ct. 2227, so a complaint's charge of conduct outside the scope of employment, when contested, warrants immediate judicial investigation. Were it otherwise, a federal employee would be stripped of suit immunity not by what the court finds, but by what the complaint alleges.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, given the purpose of the Westfall Act to shield covered employees not only from liability but from suit, it is altogether appropriate to afford protection to a \"negligent . . . employee . . . as a matter of course.\" <i>Wood,</i> 995 F.2d, at 1135 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting). But it would make scant sense to read the Act as leaving an employee charged with an intentional tort<sup>[11]</sup> to fend for himself when he denies wrongdoing and asserts he \"engaged only in proper behavior occurring wholly within the scope of his office or employment.\" <i>Ibid.</i> See also <i>Heuton,</i> 75 F.3d, at 360 (\"[I]t is illogical to assume that Congress intended to protect guilty employees but desert innocent ones.\").<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Willingham v. Morgan,</i> 395 U.S. 402, 89 S.Ct. 1813, 23 L.Ed.2d 396 (1969), in which the Court construed the federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442, supports our reading of the Westfall Act.<sup>[13]</sup> Section 1442(a)(1) allows an officer of the United States to remove a civil action commenced in state court if the officer is \"sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office.\" In <i>Willingham,</i> a federal inmate sued two federal prison officials in state court, alleging that they had assaulted, beaten, and tortured him. 395 U.S., at 403, 89 S.Ct. 1813. The defendants removed pursuant to \u00a7 1442(a)(1), and the District Court upheld their defense of official immunity. The Tenth Circuit reversed, reading <span class=\"star-pagination\">*899</span> \u00a7 1442(a)(1) to permit removal only when a defendant \"exclude[s] the possibility that the suit is based on acts or conduct not justified by his federal duty.\" <i>Morgan v. Willingham,</i> 383 F.2d 139, 141 (1967). We rejected that narrow construction of the statute and held \u00a7 1442 \"broad enough to cover all cases where federal officers can raise a colorable defense arising out of the duty to enforce federal law.\" 395 U.S., at 406-407, 89 S.Ct. 1813.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff in <i>Willingham</i> disputed that the defendant federal officials had acted under color of office. He alleged that they \"had been acting on a frolic of their own which had no relevancy to their official duties as employees or officers of the United States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 407, 89 S.Ct. 1813 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held that the officers \"should have the opportunity to <i>present their version of the facts</i> to a federal, not a state, court.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 409, 89 S.Ct. 1813 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>We see no reason to conclude that the Attorney General's ability to remove a suit to federal court under \u00a7 2679(d)(2), unlike a federal officer's ability to remove under \u00a7 1442, should be controlled by the plaintiff's allegations. In <i>Willingham,</i> the federal officer's \"relationship to [the plaintiff] derived solely from their official duties.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Similarly here, Haley interacted with Osborn and Luber only through his employment as a Forest Service officer.<sup>[14]</sup> For purposes of removal under \u00a7 1442(a), the defendants in <i>Willingham</i> were not required to accept the truth of the plaintiff's allegations that they were \"on a frolic of their own,\" <i>id.,</i> at 407, 89 S.Ct. 1813 (internal quotation marks omitted), and had tortured plaintiff \"out of malice,\" 383 F.2d, at 140 (internal quotation marks omitted). So here, for purposes of removal under \u00a7 2679(d)(2), Haley and the Government were not required to accept as true Osborn's allegations that Haley \"maliciously induced\" her dismissal from LBLA \"in retaliation for plaintiff filing a veterans' preference inquiry.\" Complaint \u00b6 29, Luber App. 7. Haley, like the defendant in <i>Willingham,</i> may have been on frolic of his own as Osborn alleged, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*900</span> therefore may not be entitled to immunity. But like the officers in <i>Willingham,</i> he should have the opportunity to \"present [his] version of the facts to a federal . . . court.\" 395 U.S., at 409, 89 S.Ct. 1813.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Tugging against our reading of the Westfall Act, we recognize, is a \"who decides\" concern. If the Westfall Act certification must be respected unless and until the District Court determines that Haley, <i>in fact,</i> engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment, then Osborn may be denied a jury trial. Compare <i>Wood,</i> 995 F.2d, at 1126, 1130, with <i>id.,</i> at 1134-1138 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting). Should the District Court find that Haley did not maliciously induce Luber to discharge Osborn, but instead interacted with Luber and Osborn only within the proper bounds of his employment, Osborn will lose on the merits with no access to a jury of her peers.<sup>[15]</sup> \"This is not a small objection,\" for the issue \"that goes to the heart of the merits, as well as to the validity of the certificate,\" will likely turn on the credibility of Osborn, Haley, and Luber, and credibility \"may be well suited for jury resolution.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 1136-1137.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>Under the Westfall Act, however, Congress supplanted the jury in covered cases. See \u00a7 2679(d)(1)-(3). Upon certification, the action is \"deemed to be. . . brought against the United States,\" <i>ibid.,</i> unless and until the district court determines that the federal officer originally named as defendant was acting outside the scope of his employment. The Seventh Amendment, which preserves the right to a jury trial in suits at common law, we have held, does not apply to proceedings against the sovereign. <i>Lehman v. Nakshian,</i> 453 U.S. 156, 101 S.Ct. 2698, 69 L.Ed.2d 548 (1981). See also \u00a7 2402 (actions against the United States ordinarily \"shall be tried by the court without a jury\"). Thus, at the time the district court reviews the Attorney General's certification, the plaintiff has no right to a jury trial. See <i>Kimbro,</i> 30 F.3d, at 1509, n. 4.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>The Westfall Act's core purpose also bears on the appropriate trier of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*901</span> any facts essential to certification. That purpose is to relieve covered employees from the cost and effort of defending the lawsuit, and to place those burdens on the Government's shoulders. See <i>supra,</i> at 892-893. Immunity-related issues, the Court has several times instructed, should be decided at the earliest opportunity. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Hunter v. Bryant,</i> 502 U.S. 224, 228, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991) <i>(per curiam)</i> (\"Immunity ordinarily should be decided by the court long before trial.\"); <i>Anderson v. Creighton,</i> 483 U.S. 635, 646, n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (\"[I]mmunity questions should be resolved at the earliest possible stage of litigation.\").<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I join the Court's opinion except for Parts II-B and II-C. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) provides, with one exception not relevant here, that \"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\" In sanctioning appellate review notwithstanding \u00a7 1447(d), the Court relies on its determination that Congress, through \u00a7 2679(d)(2), has prohibited remand in cases like this one, in order to give effect to the conclusive character of the Attorney General's certification on the issue of removal jurisdiction. But as we recently held, \"`review is unavailable no matter how plain the legal error in ordering the remand.'\" <i>Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust,</i> 547 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 2145, 2154, 165 L.Ed.2d 92 (2006) (quoting <i>Briscoe v. Bell,</i> 432 U.S. 404, 414, n. 13, 97 S.Ct. 2428, 53 L.Ed.2d 439 (1977)). Thus, rather than allowing \u00a7 2679(d)(2) to trump \u00a7 1447(d), I would reaffirm the rule that a district court's remand order is unreviewable even if it is based on an erroneous understanding of the district court's jurisdiction.<sup>[1]</sup> But I would not otherwise limit the Attorney General's (or the employee's) efforts to give the intended effect to the certification <span class=\"star-pagination\">*902</span> prior to any remand that might be ordered.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court, therefore, that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review the District Court's order resubstituting Haley as defendant. That order was not \"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed,\" so by its own terms \u00a7 1447(d) does not apply to review of that decision. Allowing review of a resubstitution order makes good on the promise of the Westfall Act: by permitting disaggregation of a remand order from a substantive determination about substitution that preceded it (in the manner exemplified by <i>Waco v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co.,</i> 293 U.S. 140, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934)), it gives an employee-defendant a right to appeal any denial of the benefit of substituting the Government as defendant in costly litigation arising out of the employee's federal service.<sup>[2]</sup> The circumstances in which the Westfall Act was adopted, responding as it did to a series of our decisions that Congress saw as having \"seriously eroded the common law tort immunity previously available to Federal employees,\" 102 Stat. 4563, note following 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671, point to the importance Congress placed on giving a federal employee a full opportunity to seek this protection. Incidentally, of course, my reading of the statutes can give an appellate court the opportunity to correct a district court's erroneous understanding of the legitimacy of removal before any remand is effected, making it very unlikely that a mistakenly premised remand order will be carried out. If a district court resisted edification, however, the remand order would be conclusive against appeal, in accord with \u00a7 1447(d). See <i>Kircher, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2154.</p>\n<p>In sum, my resolution of this case is a pair of half-loaves. The policy of avoiding litigation over remands is tempered by allowing appeals on the important matter of substitution. The policy behind making the Attorney General's certification conclusive is qualified by insulating a remand order from review, no matter how erroneous its jurisdictional premise. Neither policy has it all, but each gets something.</p>\n<p>I would remand this case to the Court of Appeals for proceedings consistent with this understanding.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court's jurisdictional analysis and its disposition of the District Court's remand order and so join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion. But I dissent from Part III. I continue to believe that the Westfall Act permits the Attorney General to certify only when accepting, at least conditionally, the existence of some kind of \"incident.\" But where the incident, if it took place at all, <i>must have</i> fallen outside the scope of employment, the Act does not permit certification. See <i>Wood v. United States,</i> 995 F.2d 1122 (C.A.1 1993) (en banc).</p>\n<p>Here, the Attorney General did claim, in the alternative, that <i>if</i> an incident took place (<i>i.e.,</i> if the federal employee Haley spoke to Osborn's employer with respect to Osborn's employment), any such incident would have fallen within the scope of Haley's employment. But, for procedural reasons, that alternative claim is not before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*903</span> us. <i>Ante,</i> at 891, n. 6. Hence I must consider this case as if it were quite a different kind of case, one in which what took place was either an incident <i>outside the scope of employment</i> or no incident at all. Consider, for example, an aggravated sexual assault, a theft of personal property, or an auto accident on Coney Island where the Government employee, say a Yellowstone Park forest ranger, if present on Coney Island must have been there on a frolic of his own. The majority's approach finds Westfall Act immunity in cases of this kind. I would not.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the Act's language suggests that it does not apply in such circumstances. The statute says that the Attorney General must certify that the employee \"was acting within the scope of his office or employment <i>at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.</i>\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2) (emphasis added). The italicized words, read naturally, assume some kind of incident, the <i>characterization</i> of which (<i>e.g.,</i> as within the scope of employment) determines whether immunity attaches. By way of contrast, permitting purely incident-denying certifications, as the majority does, can only be squared with the Act's text if the Attorney General is required to supply the reviewing court with proof of what the employee <i>was</i> doing (and that such activities <i>were</i> within the scope of employment) \"at the time of the incident\"\u0097a showing that would prove quite difficult in a case such as this, where the plaintiff has alleged that the tort was committed at some unknown time over a period of days, or weeks, or even longer.</p>\n<p>For another, there is nothing to suggest the Westfall Act sought to provide immunity for tort claims necessarily falling outside the scope of federal employment. As its popular name suggests, the Act focused upon <i>Westfall v. Erwin,</i> 484 U.S. 292, 108 S.Ct. 580, 98 L.Ed.2d 619 (1988), an earlier case in which the Court considered whether, to obtain immunity from state-law tort suits, a federal official had to show not just that his conduct was \"within the scope of [his] employment,\" but also that it was <i>\"discretionary in nature.\" Id.,</i> at 295, 108 S.Ct. 580 (emphasis added). The Court answered \"yes.\" It held that a federal employee was <i>not</i> immune from a state-law tort suit, even for simple negligence, unless the employee could also show that his conduct was discretionary.</p>\n<p>The Westfall Act basically seeks to overturn this holding. As this Court has said, \"[w]hen Congress wrote the Westfall Act. . ., the legislators had one purpose firmly in mind [namely] to override <i>Westfall v. </i><i>Erwin.</i>\" <i>Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno,</i> 515 U.S. 417, 425, 115 S.Ct. 2227, 132 L.Ed.2d 375 (1995). The House Judiciary Committee wrote that the Act's \"functional effect . . . is to return Federal employees to the status they held prior to the <i>Westfall</i> decision.\" H.R.Rep. No. 100-700, p. 4 (1988), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 1988, pp. 5945, 5947. And that \"status,\" many thought, was an immunity that applied to nondiscretionary, as well as discretionary, actions that fell \"within the scope\" of the employee's \"office or employment.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(1); H.R.Rep. No. 100-700, at 4.</p>\n<p>In a word, the Act seeks to <i>maintain</i> the scope of pre-<i>Westfall</i> immunity <i>minus Westfall'</i>s <i>\"discretionary function\" limitation.</i> That purpose does not encompass an extension of immunity to all-or-nothing conduct, <i>i.e.,</i> those serious assaults or personal \"frolics\" that, <i>if they took place at all,</i> could not possibly have fallen within the scope of the employee's \"office or employment.\"</p>\n<p>Further, to try to bring the latter type of conduct within the scope of the Act's immunity creates a series of anomalies. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*904</span> As the Court recognizes, its interpretation may limit the plaintiff's ability to obtain jury consideration of factual matters critical to his or her case. Indeed, <i>any</i> Government employee defendant, including a defendant whom the Attorney General does <i>not</i> want to defend, can ask the judge to issue a certificate. \u00a7 2679(d)(3). On the Court's view of the statute, the issuance of the certificate could depend upon whether, for example, the aggravated sexual assault took place at all or whether the defendant was at Yellowstone or Coney Island at the relevant times. And, in deciding these questions (as the judge would have to do to determine whether the certificate should issue), the judge, not the jury, would decide the main issue in the case. (The Court declines to address the effect of its analysis on \u00a7 2679(d)(3). <i>Ante,</i> at 900, n. 17. But the relevant language in this provision is virtually identical to the language at issue in this case, see \u00a7 2679(d)(2), so one cannot seriously suggest that the Act by its own terms affords employees any narrower a basis for seeking certification than it affords the Attorney General.)</p>\n<p>It is highly unusual to permit special, speedy judge factfinding where immunity is at issue. Ordinarily, when a party asserts an immunity defense, <i>i.e.,</i> an \"entitlement not to stand trial <i>under certain circumstances,</i>\" <i>Mitchell v. Forsyth,</i> 472 U.S. 511, 525, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (emphasis added), special immunity-related procedures focus, not upon factfinding, but upon the proper <i>legal characterization</i> of the facts as given. Where the parties' immunity-related disagreement amounts to a dispute about the <i>law,</i> namely whether the particular set of facts alleged by the plaintiff does, or does not, fall within the immunity's legal scope, the defendant is entitled to a quick determination of the legal question by the trial judge and, if necessary, an immediate interlocutory appeal. <i>Id.,</i> at 526, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806. See <i>Nixon v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 731, 742-743, 102 S.Ct. 2690, 73 L.Ed.2d 349 (1982); see also <i>Helstoski v. Meanor,</i> 442 U.S. 500, 507-508, 99 S.Ct. 2445, 61 L.Ed.2d 30 (1979). But where that disagreement amounts to a dispute about the <i>facts,</i> immunity law does <i>not</i> ordinarily entitle the defendant to special procedural treatment. Rather, the defendant must take the <i>facts</i> as the plaintiff asserts them. Like any other defendant, he can move for summary judgment. <i>Mitchell, supra,</i> at 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806; <i>Anderson v. Creighton,</i> 483 U.S. 635, 646-647, n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). But if the plaintiff provides sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment, the defendant must win the case at trial.</p>\n<p>Thus ordinarily an immunity defense provides special procedural treatment only for a defendant's legal claim that the facts <i>taken as the plaintiff asserts them</i> (or <i>taken as the assertions have survived a motion for summary judgment</i>) fall within the scope of the immunity. It does not provide special treatment for disputes about the facts. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Jones,</i> 515 U.S. 304, 319-320, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995) (defendant raising immunity defense \"may not appeal a district court's summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a `genuine' issue of fact for trial\"). The Court's reading of the Westfall Act works a major change in this fact/law relationship. Under the Court's reading, the defendant will have the right to ask the judge to determine the facts, <i>i.e.,</i> to determine whether the events plaintiff says occurred did in fact happen. And that is so <i>even where the plaintiff has enough evidence to bring the case to the jury.</i></p>\n<p>The Court's reading of the Act proves even more anomalous in the case of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*905</span> federal employee claiming an assault that violates both (a) state tort law and (b) federal civil rights law. Suppose that the defendant's sole defense is \"mistaken identity.\" The defendant argues that nothing took place between him and the plaintiff, that at the relevant time he was working peacefully at his desk. Under the Court's reading, the defendant is entitled to have the <i>judge</i> decide the factual question; and, should the judge decide in his favor (in respect to the state-law tort claim), collateral estoppel likely means an end of the matter in respect to the federal civil rights claim, as well. Yet the Westfall Act explicitly <i>exempts</i> from its scope any claim of \"violation of a federal statute\" or the Federal Constitution. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(2).</p>\n<p>The Court rests much of its analysis on <i>Willingham v. Morgan,</i> 395 U.S. 402, 89 S.Ct. 1813, 23 L.Ed.2d 396 (1969), but I do not think that case offers much support. <i>Willingham</i> addressed <i>only</i> a federal officer's right to remove a case to federal court (via \u00a7 1442(a)(1)). <i>Id.,</i> at 403, 89 S.Ct. 1813. Once there, the officer could pursue traditional immunity defenses, <i>i.e.,</i> based on the facts as alleged by the plaintiff or as they survived summary judgment; that is all the Court could have meant when it said that officers \"should have the opportunity to present their version of the facts to a federal, not a state, court,\" <i>id.,</i> at 409, 89 S.Ct. 1813. Moreover, in <i>Mesa v. California,</i> 489 U.S. 121, 139, 109 S.Ct. 959, 103 L.Ed.2d 99 (1989), this Court held that \"[f]ederal officer removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a) must be predicated upon averment of a federal defense.\" Because the federal employee defendants in <i>Mesa</i> \"ha[d] not and could not present an official immunity defense\" to the charges against them, removal was improper under \u00a7 1442(a)(1). <i>Id.,</i> at 133, 109 S.Ct. 959. The majority reads the Westfall Act much more broadly than this Court read \u00a7 1442(a) in <i>Mesa,</i> permitting removal in cases where there is unquestionably no official immunity defense available (at least as such defenses have been understood by this Court until today). And in so doing, the majority opens wide the door not just to removal, which was all that was at issue in <i>Willingham</i> and <i>Mesa,</i> but, much more consequentially, to substituting a judge's factfinding for a plaintiff's jury trial right.</p>\n<p>I do not claim that my own reading of the Westfall Act will totally eliminate the difficulties I have mentioned. But an interpretation that reads the Act's language more literally will minimize them, while also largely mitigating the problem of clever pleading with which the majority is rightly concerned, <i>ante,</i> at 898. The Act says the \"Attorney General\" must certify that the \"employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment <i>at the time of the incident</i> out of which the claim arose.\" \u00a7 2679(d)(2) (emphasis added). As I have said, that language prevents the Attorney General from denying that any \"incident\" at all occurred without at least adding in the alternative that any incident the plaintiff might be able to show falls within the employee's scope of employment regardless.</p>\n<p>Thus, if a plaintiff claims an <i>intentional</i> touching (outside the scope of employment), the Attorney General is free to claim (a) there was no touching but (b) were the evidence to show a touching, it was accidental (within the scope of employment). Yet if the plaintiff accuses the employee, a Yellowstone Park ranger, of negligent driving on Coney Island, the Attorney General could not make a similar claim. (Nor could he likely do so in respect to an employee whom the plaintiff claims committed a serious sexual assault.) That is because if these latter incidents did happen, they must have fallen outside the scope of employment, while if they did not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*906</span> happen, then <i>nothing</i> involving the employee happened at all. In such cases no Westfall Act immunity would be available. And that is just as it should be.</p>\n<p>This approach resembles, but differs in important respects from that of the First Circuit in <i>Wood.</i> In <i>Wood,</i> the First Circuit held that a judge reviewing a Westfall Act certificate could resolve factual conflicts as to \"incident-describing and incident-characterizing facts,\" but must leave for the jury (if it came to that) disputes over whether any incident occurred at all. 995 F.2d, at 1129. Here, I offer a compromise between <i>Wood</i> and the majority's more extreme approach. I would permit a judge reviewing a Westfall Act certificate to resolve <i>any</i> factual disputes relevant to whether the defendant was \"acting within the scope of his office or employment,\" including, when necessary, determining whether the incident occurred at all. But I would only permit the judge to fulfill this factfinding function in those cases where the Attorney General (or the defendant employee, under \u00a7 2679(d)(3)) can offer <i>some</i> plausible explanation of the alleged incident that would bring the defendant's actions within the scope of his federal office or employment.</p>\n<p>The majority's approach, absent some undefined constraint that might be imposed in future cases, <i>ante,</i> at 899, n. 14, would permit factfinding by a judge (and, where the Attorney General requests, removal to federal court) in <i>any</i> state-law tort case involving a federal employee. I would permit judges to fulfill this rather extraordinary factfinding function only in those cases where the \"injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death\" for which the plaintiff seeks recovery <i>might</i> have \"aris[en] or result[ed] from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of [the federal employee] while acting within the scope of his office or employment\"\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> where there is <i>some chance</i> the injury (if any) was caused by the kinds of actions for which the Act expressly grants employees immunity, under \u00a7 2679(b)(1). This approach protects the innocent employee as well as the guilty, <i>ante,</i> at 898, but only in the class of law suits the Act can plausibly be read to cover.</p>\n<p>Because the Court of Appeals interpreted the Act as does the Court, I would vacate its judgment. I would, however, permit the Court of Appeals to consider the Government's alternative assertion of immunity (including whether it was properly barred by the trial court), and to determine whether Westfall Act immunity applies on that basis.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I dissent from Part III of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Few statutes read more clearly than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d): \"An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise . . . .\"<sup>[1]</sup> That bar to appellate review is a venerable one, dating back to 1887, see <i>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer,</i> 423 U.S. 336, 343, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976). It is, moreover, not just hortatory; it is jurisdictional. <i>Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca,</i> 516 U.S. 124, 127-128, 116 S.Ct. 494, 133 L.Ed.2d 461 (1995). Yet beginning in 1976, this Court has repeatedly eroded \u00a7 1447(d)'s mandate and expanded the Court's jurisdiction. Today's opinion eviscerates <span class=\"star-pagination\">*907</span> what little remained of Congress's Court-limiting command.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The first narrowing of \u00a7 1447(d) occurred in <i>Thermtron Products,</i> over the dissent of Justice Rehnquist joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Stewart (only eight Justices sat in the case). <i>Thermtron Products</i> held that remand orders <i>are</i> reviewable if they are based on any grounds <i>other</i> than the mandatory ground for remand set forth in \u00a7 1447(c)\u0097 namely, that \"`the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.'\"<sup>[2]</sup> 423 U.S., at 342, 96 S.Ct. 584. That result followed, the Court said, because subsections (c) and (d) are <i>\"in pari materia\"</i> and \"must be construed together.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 345, 96 S.Ct. 584. Thus, the unlimited phrase \"[a]n order remanding a case\" magically became \"an order remanding a case under this section\"\u0097changing prior law, under which the Court had held that the predecessors of \u00a7 1447(d) prohibited review of all remand orders. See <i>id.,</i> at 354-356, 96 S.Ct. 584 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Since, in <i>Thermtron Products,</i> the District Court had remanded solely because of its crowded docket, we accepted review and issued a writ of mandamus compelling reconsideration of the order. See also <i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 517 U.S. 706, 710-712, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996) (reviewing a remand order predicated on abstention under <i>Burford v. Sun Oil Co.,</i> 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943)).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The next phase in \u00a7 1447(d)'s erosion came just last Term, in <i>Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust,</i> 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2145, 165 L.Ed.2d 92 (2006). There, as here, the District Court had remanded to state court \"on the ground that [it] lacked subject matter jurisdiction on removal.\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2148. That should have been the end of the matter, but it was not. The <i>Kircher</i> majority embarked on a searching inquiry into whether the District Court's <i>real reason</i> for remand was lack of jurisdiction. See <i>id.,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2154-2158. In my concurrence, I warned that \"[r]eview of the sort engaged in . . . threatens to defeat the purpose of \u00a7 1447(d),\" which was \"`to prevent delay in the trial of remanded cases by protracted litigation of jurisdictional issues.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___-___, 126 S.Ct., at 2148 (quoting <i>Thermtron Products, supra,</i> at 351, 96 S.Ct. 584).</p>\n<blockquote>\"Such delay can be created just as easily by asking whether the district court correctly characterized the basis for its order as it can by asking whether that basis was correct . . . . Whether the District Court was right or wrong\u0097even if it was so badly mistaken that it misunderstood the true basis for its orders\u0097it <i>purported</i> to remand for lack of jurisdiction, and \u00a7 1447(d) bars any further review.\" <i>Kircher,</i> 547 U.S., at ___- ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2148.</blockquote>\n<p>Today's opinion goes even further than <i>Kircher.</i> Whereas that case at least <i>claimed</i> to be applying our precedents, see, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at ___-___, 126 S.Ct., at 2154-2155 (citing <i>Briscoe v. Bell,</i> 432 U.S. 404, 413-414, n. 13, 97 S.Ct. 2428, 53 L.Ed.2d 439 (1977)), today's opinion makes no such pretense. Having recognized, as it must, that the District Court in this case <span class=\"star-pagination\">*908</span> invoked \u00a7 1447(c) and remanded for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, <i>ante,</i> at 896, the Court nevertheless reaches the amazing conclusion that \u00a7 1447(d) does not \"contro[l]\" whether the remand order is reviewable on appeal. <i>Ante,</i> at 895-896.</p>\n<p>How can that be? How can a statute explicitly eliminating appellate jurisdiction to review a remand order not \"contro[l]\" whether an appellate court has jurisdiction to review a remand order? The Court says the answer to this riddle lies in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2). But that section says only that the Attorney General's certification is \"conclusiv[e] . . . for purposes of <i>removal</i>\" (emphasis added); it says absolutely nothing about the reviewability of remand orders. Thus, the most \u00a7 2679(d)(2) can prove is that the District Court should not have remanded the case; that its remand order was erroneous. But our precedents make abundantly clear that \u00a7 1447(d)'s appellate-review bar applies with full force to erroneous remand orders. Just last Term we acknowledged that \"a remand premised on an erroneous conclusion of no jurisdiction is unappealable.\" <i>Kircher, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2155. See also <i>Thermtron Products, supra,</i> at 343, 96 S.Ct. 584 (\"If a trial judge <i>purports</i> to remand a case on the ground that it was removed `improvidently and without jurisdiction,' his order is not subject to challenge in the court of appeals by appeal, by mandamus, or otherwise\") (quoting \u00a7 1447(c) (1975 ed.) (emphasis added)); <i>Briscoe, supra,</i> at 414, n. 13, 97 S.Ct. 2428 (where a remand order is based on one of the grounds enumerated in \u00a7 1447(c), \"review is unavailable no matter how plain the legal error in ordering the remand\"). Today's opinion repudiates that principle. The <i>only</i> basis for its holding is that \u00a7 2679(d)(2) renders the remand erroneous. This utterly novel proposition, that a remand order can be set aside when it is contrary to law, leaves nothing remaining of \u00a7 1447(d). Determination of an order's lawfulness can only be made upon review\u0097and it is precisely review that \u00a7 1447(d) forbids.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Congress knows how to make remand orders reviewable when it wishes to do so. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441a(<i>l</i>)(3)(C) (\"The Corporation may appeal any order of remand entered by a United States district court\"); \u00a7 1819(b)(2)(C) (same); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 487(d) (\"[T]he United States shall have the right to appeal from any order of remand in the case\"). Even \u00a7 1447(d) itself exempts certain remand orders from its own appellate-review bar. See n. 1, <i>supra.</i> \"Absent a clear statutory command to the contrary, we assume that Congress is aware of the universality of th[e] practice of denying appellate review of remand orders when Congress creates a new ground for removal.\" <i>Things Remembered,</i> 516 U.S., at 128, 116 S.Ct. 494 (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Court recognized in <i>Kircher,</i> \"[t]here is no such `clear statutory command' here, and that silence tells us we must look to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) to determine the reviewability of remand orders under the Act.\" 547 U.S., at ___, n. 8, 126 S.Ct., at 2154, n. 8. Were the Court in this case to look to \u00a7 1447(d), instead of looking for a way around \u00a7 1447(d), the answer would be abundantly clear.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Respondents argued that, even if the remand order is unreviewable on appeal, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*909</span> the District Court's rejection of the Attorney General's certification should be reviewable as a logically distinct determination, citing <i>Waco v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co.,</i> 293 U.S. 140, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934). See <i>ante,</i> at 901-902 (SOUTER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (adopting this argument).</p>\n<p>The continuing vitality of <i>Waco</i> is dubious in light of more recent precedents, see <i>Kircher, supra,</i> at ___, n. 13, 126 S.Ct., at 2156, n. 13. We need not address that question here, however, since <i>Waco</i> is patently inapposite. There, removal had been premised on diversity jurisdiction. The District Court dismissed the party whose citizenship was alleged to supply the requisite diversity, finding that party's joinder improper, and thus remanded the case for lack of jurisdiction. We found the dismissal order to be reviewable on appeal, even though the remand order was not. 293 U.S., at 143, 55 S.Ct. 6. But there is a crucial distinction between that case and this one: In <i>Waco,</i> reversal of the dismissal would not have subverted the remand. There was <i>no question</i> that the suit would proceed in state court regardless of whether the diverse party was rightfully or wrongfully dismissed. Nowhere did the <i>Waco</i> Court so much as hint that the District Court might need to reexamine its remand order; to the contrary, it was clear that the remand would occur, no matter what: \"If the District Court's [dismissal] order stands, the cross-action will be no part of the case which is remanded to the state court . . . . <i>A reversal cannot affect the order of remand,</i> but it will at least, if the dismissal of the petitioner's complaint was erroneous, remit the entire controversy, with the [diverse party] still a party, to the state court for such further proceedings.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 143-144, 55 S.Ct. 6 (emphasis added). In other words, the remand order and the dismissal order were truly \"separate orders,\" <i>id.,</i> at 142, 55 S.Ct. 6; we could review\u0097even reverse\u0097the dismissal order without affecting the remand or its impact on the case.</p>\n<p>Today's case far more closely resembles <i>Kircher.</i> There, the remand order had been predicated upon a finding that the cause of action was not a \"covered\" class-action suit as defined by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), 112 Stat. 3227, and therefore that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction. The District Court remanded so the suit could continue in state court, outside the confines of SLUSA. If the suit had been \"covered,\" SLUSA would have precluded the action from going forward in any court, state or federal. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77p(b). We therefore determined that neither the remand itself <i>nor the determination of SLUSA inapplicability</i> was reviewable on appeal: \"The District Court's remand order here cannot be disaggregated as the <i>Waco</i> orders could, and if [we were to find the suit to be covered by SLUSA], there [would be] nothing to remand to state court.\" 547 U.S., at ___, n. 13, 126 S.Ct., at 2156, n. 13. That is precisely the situation in this case: The remand here is predicated upon a finding that the United States should not be substituted as a defendant under the Westfall Act. If we were to disagree with the District Court and substitute the United States as a defendant, while at the same time recognizing (as \u00a7 1447(d) requires) that there is nothing we can do about the remand order, the case would go back to state court as an action under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), see <i>ante,</i> at 888, and the remanded case would be styled <i>Osborn v. United States.</i> But the state court would have to dismiss such a case at once, since federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over FTCA suits. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). Thus, as in <i>Kircher,</i> but unlike <i>Waco,</i> the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*910</span> District Court's decision on the preliminary matter\u0097here, Westfall Act certification; in <i>Kircher,</i> SLUSA applicability\u0097is inextricably intertwined with the remand order. Since that is so, there is no jurisdiction to review either determination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>In an all-too-rare effort to reduce the high cost of litigation, Congress provided that remand orders are completely unreviewable \"on appeal or otherwise.\" Section 1447(d) effectuated a tradeoff of sorts: Even though Congress undoubtedly recognized that some remand orders would be entered in error, it thought that, all in all, justice would better be served by allowing that small minority of cases to proceed in state courts than by subjecting every remanded case to endless rounds of forum disputes. \"[B]y denying any form of review of an order of remand,\" \"Congress. . . established the policy of not permitting interrupting of the litigation of the merits of a removed cause by prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.\" <i>United States v. Rice,</i> 327 U.S. 742, 751, 66 S.Ct. 835, 90 L.Ed. 982 (1946). Today, in its uncompromising pursuit of technical perfection at all costs, this Court has repealed the tradeoff. One might suggest that Congress should restore it, but it is hard to imagine new statutory language accomplishing the desired result any more clearly than \u00a7 1447(d) already does.</p>\n<p>I would vacate the Sixth Circuit's judgment in its entirety, since that court, like this one, plainly lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We draw this account of the facts from the District Court's opinion and order denying reconsideration, supplemented by the allegations in Osborn's complaint.</p>\n<p>[2]  The certification read:\n</p>\n<p>\"I, Monica Wheatley, Acting United States Attorney, Western District of Kentucky, acting pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2), and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Appendix to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.3 (1990), hereby certify that the Office of the United States Attorney has reviewed the available facts in this matter. On the basis of the information now available to me with respect to the allegations in the complaint, I find that the named federal defendant, Barry Haley, was acting within the scope of his employment with the U.S. Forest Service, at the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint.\" Luber App. 23.</p>\n<p>[3]  The federal officer removal statute provides that \"[a] civil action or criminal prosecution commenced in a State court against\" \"any officer ... of the United States ... sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office\" \"may be removed... to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending.\" \u00a7 1442(a), (a)(1), (b).</p>\n<p>[4]  The District Court did not address the propriety of removal under \u00a7 1442. See <i>infra,</i> at ___20, n. 11.</p>\n<p>[5]  Section 1447(c) provides:\n</p>\n<p>\"A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a). If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. An order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal. A certified copy of the order of remand shall be mailed by the clerk to the clerk of the State court. The State court may thereupon proceed with such case.\"</p>\n<p>[6]  The District Court refused to entertain the alternative argument that, if a relevant Haley-Luber conversation did occur, Haley was acting within the scope of his employment. Because Haley had declared, under oath, that he did not communicate with Luber, the court was unwilling to allow discovery on the question whether, if Haley did contact Luber, he was acting within the scope of his employment. But cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(e)(2) (subject to Rule 11 obligations, parties may plead claims or defense \"alternately or hypothetically\"). We express no opinion on the propriety of the District Court's refusal to consider the Government's alternative pleading.</p>\n<p>[7]  Section 1291 provides that \"[t]he courts of appeals . . . shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  At the time <i>Thermtron</i> was decided, \u00a7 1447(c) required a district court to remand a case if it appeared that the case had been \"removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) (1970 ed.). Section 1447(c) now provides that a case must be remanded if \"it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\"</p>\n<p>[9]  As explained by the Third Circuit in <i>Melo v. Hafer,</i> 912 F.2d 628, 641 (1990), \"[t]here are significant policy reasons why Congress would choose to give the government an unchallengeable right to have a federal forum for tort suits brought against its employees.\" But Congress' endeavor to secure that right does not mean that Congress also intended to render unreviewable substitution of the United States as defendant in place of the employee. See <i>ibid.;</i> cf. <i>Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno,</i> 515 U.S. 417, 430-434, 115 S.Ct. 2227, 132 L.Ed.2d 375 (1995).</p>\n<p>[10]  In an opinion resembling his majority opinion in <i>Wood v. United States,</i> 995 F.2d 1122 (C.A.1 1993) (en banc), Justice BREYER takes the view that the Attorney General may issue a Westfall Act certification if he contests the plaintiff's account of the episode-in-suit, but he must \"assume some kind of incident\" in order to certify. <i>Post,</i> at 903. Thus he would not permit \"purely incident-denying certifications,\" and he places the certification here in that category. <i>Ibid.</i> We agree with the <i>Wood</i> dissenters' appraisal of Justice BREYER's distinction between incident-denying and incident-recharacterizing certifications: That approach would require district courts \"to engage in difficult, time-wasting controversies . . . about precisely <i>which facts</i> pertaining to the scope of employment issue are for the district judge and which are for the jury.\" 995 F.2d, at 1136, and n. 7 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting). Accord <i>Kimbro v. Velten,</i> 30 F.3d 1501, 1507 (C.A.D.C.1994) (\"[I]t would be impossible . . . to draw a distinction between a characterization of an incident and whether or not it actually occurred.\").</p>\n<p>[11]  See <i>id.,</i> at 1505 (observing that the question here presented \"tend[s] to arise in cases of alleged intentional torts\").</p>\n<p>[12]  Under Justice BREYER's view, when, in fact, \"<i>nothing</i> involving the employee happened at all . . . no Westfall Act immunity would be available.\" <i>Post,</i> at 905-906. He thinks this \"is just as it should be.\" <i>Post,</i> at 906. We disagree. Congress did not, and sensibly should not, command that innocent employees be left outside the Westfall Act's grant of suit immunity. \"Congress' statute and its policy,\" we agree, \"both look in the opposite direction.\" <i>Wood,</i> 995 F.2d, at 1136 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[13]  The notice of removal in this case invoked \u00a7 1442 as well as \u00a7 2679. In the Sixth Circuit, however, the Government did not urge \u00a7 1442 as a separate ground for reversing the District Court.</p>\n<p>[14]  In the context of \u00a7 1442, we have held that, to qualify for removal, a federal official must show \"a nexus . . . between the charged conduct and asserted official authority.\" <i>Jefferson County v. Acker,</i> 527 U.S. 423, 431, 119 S.Ct. 2069, 144 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We need not today decide whether qualification for Westfall Act immunity is similarly limited, for in this case, a nexus plainly exists connecting the incident Osborn alleged and Haley's federal employment. We note, however, that nothing in our opinion commits the Court to the view that Westfall Act immunity is available in fanciful situations like the one Justice BREYER hypothesizes, <i>post,</i> at 902-903, in which the plaintiff's allegations are wholly unrelated to the defendant's federal employment.\n</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER posits the case of a Yellowstone Park forest ranger accused of misdeeds at Coney Island. He says we would find Westfall Act immunity\u0097more accurately, we would uphold Westfall Act certification\u0097 even if the ranger's \"presen[ce] on Coney Island must have been . . . on a frolic of his own.\" <i>Post,</i> at 902-903. If Justice BREYER is imagining a case in which the ranger was in fact on a frolic at Coney Island, but the Attorney General nevertheless issued a Westfall Act certificate, we would not approve the certification. In that imaginary case, there would be no sense in which the ranger was acting within the scope of his employment <i>at the time</i> of the incident charged in the plaintiff's complaint. If, instead, Justice BREYER has in mind a ranger accused of frolicking at Coney Island, when all the while he stayed close to his desk at Yellowstone Park, then Justice BREYER is correct: Westfall Act immunity might be available under our approach. If such a case ever shows up in a federal court, however, the district judge might be called upon to determine whether removal and substitution under \u00a7 2679(d)(2) are limited by a nexus requirement similar to the one that limits removal under \u00a7 1442.</p>\n<p>[15]  The overlap of certification validity and the merits of the plaintiff's claim, evident here, is uncommon. It is unlikely to occur when the plaintiff alleges negligent conduct. The question whether a federal driver was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of an accident, for example, can generally be answered without simultaneously determining whether the federal employee drove negligently or carefully. And even when the plaintiff alleges an intentional tort, it may be possible to resolve the scope-of-employment question without deciding the merits of the claim. If a plaintiff charges a federal employee with sexual assault, for example, upon determining that there was sexual contact, a district court could find that the employee acted outside the scope of his duties, leaving the question whether the contact was consensual for jury resolution.</p>\n<p>[16]  But cf. 995 F.2d, at 1137 (observing that \"[i]n the ordinary tort claim arising when a government driver negligently runs into another car, jury trial is precisely what is lost to a plaintiff when the government is substituted for the employee\").</p>\n<p>[17]  We do not address the case in which the Attorney General refuses certification. In that event, \u00a7 2679(d)(3) allows the named defendant to \"petition the court to find and certify that [he] was acting within the scope of his . . . employment.\" However, the Westfall Act gives the named defendant no right to remove an uncertified case. But see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1). That right is accorded to the Attorney General only. Because the scope determination would be made in such a case before any substitution of the United States as defendant takes place, it is arguable that a jury trial of that issue would be required if the case is before a federal court. If the case was brought in a state court and the Attorney General declines to remove, the Seventh Amendment would not figure in the case, for it is inapplicable to proceedings in state court. <i>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis,</i> 241 U.S. 211, 217, 36 S.Ct. 595, 60 L.Ed. 961 (1916).</p>\n<p>[18]  Justice BREYER suggests that, with respect to immunity defenses, our \"reading of the Westfall Act works a major change in th[e] [ordinary] fact/law relationship.\" <i>Post,</i> at 904-905. Nothing in our opinion touches on that relationship in the typical case in which a defendant official raises a defense of absolute or qualified immunity. We simply observe that the Westfall Act grants federal employees a species of immunity, and that, under our jurisprudence, immunity-related questions should be resolved at the earliest opportunity. Justice BREYER is right, however, to this extent. We recognize that judges have a greater factfinding role in Westfall Act cases than they traditionally have in other immunity contexts. The Act makes that inevitable. When Westfall Act immunity is in dispute, a district court is called upon to decide who the proper defendant is: the named federal employee, or the United States. That decision cannot be left for jury resolution late in proceedings without undermining the Westfall Act's very purpose: to shift the burden of defending the suit to the United States whenever the defendant-employee was, at the relevant time, acting within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p>[1]  The exception to \u00a7 1447(d) created in <i>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer,</i> 423 U.S. 336, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976), for remands not authorized by \u00a7 1447(c) does not apply here because the District Court remanded the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a ground enumerated in \u00a7 1447(c).</p>\n<p>[2]  The circumstances of this case make it clear that <i>Waco</i> ought to endure as an exception to \u00a7 1447(d), a question left open in <i>Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust,</i> 547 U.S. ___, ___, n. 13, 126 S.Ct. 2145, 2156, n. 13, 165 L.Ed.2d 92 (2006). A contrary rule would preclude appellate review not only of the remand order itself, but also of the refusal to substitute the Government as defendant.</p>\n<p>[1]  The remaining clause of \u00a7 1447(d) provides an exception that is not applicable here: \"except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  Section 1447(c) has since been amended, specifying as grounds for mandatory remand that \"the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  The <i>Thermtron Products</i> limitation upon the \u00a7 1447(d) bar to appellate review does not affect this case. As the Court recognizes, <i>ante,</i> at 905, the District Court was perfectly clear that its remand to state court was based on its lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>[4]  Like the Court, I need not address whether allowing the case to remain in federal court after declining to substitute the United States as defendant would create an Article III problem. Unlike the Court, however, I choose not to address the point in dicta. See <i>ante,</i> at 895-896 (noting that \"the question would only arise if\" certain events take place, yet answering the question anyway).</p>\n\n</div>",

HALEY ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 05\u2013593.      Argued October 30, 2006\u2014Decided January 22, 2007\nThe federal statute commonly known as the Westfall Act accords fed\n  eral employees absolute immunity from tort claims arising out of acts\n  undertaken in the course of their official duties, 28 U. S. C.\n  \u00a72679(b)(1), and empowers the Attorney General to certify that a fed\n  eral employee sued for wrongful or negligent conduct \u201cwas acting\n  within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the inci\n  dent out of which the claim arose,\u201d \u00a72679(d)(1), (2). Upon such certi\n  fication, the United States is substituted as defendant in place of the\n  employee, and the action is thereafter governed by the Federal Tort\n  Claims Act. If the action commenced in state court, the Westfall Act\n  calls for its removal to a federal district court, and renders the Attor\n  ney General\u2019s certification \u201cconclusiv[e] . . . for purposes of removal.\u201d\n  \u00a72679(d)(2).\n     Plaintiff-petitioner Pat Osborn sued federal employee Barry Haley\n  in state court. Osborn alleged that Haley tortiously interfered with\n  her employment with a private contractor, that he conspired to cause\n  her wrongful discharge, and that his efforts to bring about her dis\n  charge were outside the scope of his employment. The United States\n  Attorney, serving as the Attorney General\u2019s delegate, certified that\n  Haley was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of\n  the conduct alleged in Osborn\u2019s complaint. She thereupon removed\n  the case to a federal district court, where she asserted that the al\n  leged wrongdoing never occurred. The District Court, relying in\n  Osborn\u2019s allegations, entered an order that rejected the Westfall Act\n  certification, denied the Government\u2019s motion to substitute the\n  United States as defendant in Haley\u2019s place, and remanded the case\n  to the state court. The Sixth Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s or\n  der, holding that a Westfall Act certification is not improper simply\n2                         OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n because the United States denies the occurrence of the incident on\n which the plaintiff centrally relies. Based on \u00a72679(d)(2)\u2019s direction\n that certification is \u201cconclusiv[e] . . . for purposes of removal,\u201d the\n Court of Appeals instructed the District Court to retain jurisdiction\n over the case.\nHeld:\n    1. The Attorney General\u2019s certification is conclusive for purposes of\n removal, i.e., once certification and removal are effected, exclusive\n competence to adjudicate the case resides in the federal court, and\n that court may not remand the suit to the state court. Pp. 9\u201317.\n       (a) The Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the order reject\n ing the Attorney General\u2019s certification and denying substitution of\n the United States as defendant. Under the collateral order doctrine\n of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, the Dis\n trict Court\u2019s ruling, which effectively denied Haley Westfall Act pro\n tection, qualifies as a reviewable final decision under 28 U. S. C.\n \u00a71291. Meeting Cohen\u2019s three criteria, the District Court\u2019s denial of\n certification and substitution conclusively decided a contested issue,\n the issue decided is important and separate from the merits of the ac\n tion, and the District Court\u2019s disposition would be effectively unre\n viewable later in the litigation. 337 U. S., at 546. Pp. 9\u201311.\n       (b) The Sixth Circuit also had jurisdiction to review the District\n Court\u2019s remand order. Pp. 11\u201317.\n         (1) The Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the District\n Court\u2019s remand order, notwithstanding 28 U. S. C. \u00a71447(d), which\n states that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court . . . is not\n reviewable on appeal or otherwise . . . .\u201d This Court held, in Therm\n tron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S. 336, that \u00a71447(c)\n confines \u00a71447(d)\u2019s scope. Section \u00a71447(c) provides that a case must\n be remanded \u201cif . . . it appears that the district court lacks subject\n matter jurisdiction.\u201d Under Thermtron, \u201conly remand orders issued\n under \u00a71447(c) and invoking the [mandatory ground] specified\n therein . . . are immune from review\u201d under \u00a71447(d). Id., at 346. To\n determine whether Thermtron\u2019s reasoning controls here, the Westfall\n Act\u2019s design, particularly its prescriptions regarding the removal and\n remand of actions filed in state court, must be examined.\n    When the Attorney General certifies that a federal employee\n named defendant in a state-court tort action was acting within the\n scope of his or her employment at the time in question, the action\n \u201cshall be removed\u201d to federal court and the United States must be\n substituted as the defendant. \u00a72679(d)(2). Of prime importance\n here, \u00a72679(d)(2) concludes with the command that the \u201ccertification\n of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or\n employment for purposes of removal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This direc\n                   Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ntive markedly differs from Congress\u2019 instruction for cases in which\nthe Attorney General \u201crefuse[s] to certify scope of office or employ\nment.\u201d \u00a72679(d)(3). In that event, the defendant-employee may peti\ntion the court in which the action is instituted to make the scope-of\nemployment certification. If the employee so petitions in an action\nfiled in state court, the Attorney General may, at his discretion, re\nmove the action to federal court. If removal has occurred, and there\nafter \u201cthe district court determines that the employee was not acting\nwithin the scope of his office or employment, the action . . . shall be\nremanded to the State court.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   The Act\u2019s distinction between removed cases in which the Attorney\nGeneral issues a scope-of-employment certification and those in\nwhich he does not leads to the conclusion that Congress gave district\ncourts no authority to return cases to state courts on the ground that\nthe Attorney General\u2019s certification was unwarranted. Section\n2679(d)(2) does not preclude a district court from resubstituting the\nfederal official as defendant for purposes of trial if the court deter\nmines, postremoval, that the Attorney General\u2019s scope-of-employment\ncertification was incorrect. For purposes of establishing a forum for\nadjudication, however, \u00a72679(d)(2) renders the Attorney General\u2019s\ncertification dispositive. Were it open to a district court to remand a\nremoved action on the ground that the Attorney General\u2019s certifica\ntion was erroneous, \u00a72679(d)(2)\u2019s final instruction would be weight\nless. Congress adopted the \u201cconclusiv[e] . . . for the purposes of re\nmoval\u201d language to \u201cforeclose needless shuttling of a case from one\ncourt to another,\u201d Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417,\n433, n. 10. The provision assures that \u201conce a state tort action has\nbeen removed to a federal court after a certification by the Attorney\nGeneral, it may never be remanded to the state system.\u201d Id., at 440\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting).\n   Thermtron held that \u00a71447(d) must be read together with \u00a71447(c).\nThere is stronger cause to hold that \u00a71447(c) and (d) must be read to\ngether with the later enacted \u00a72679(d)(2). Both \u00a71447(d) and\n\u00a72679(d)(2) are antishuttling provisions that aim to prevent \u201cpro\nlonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to\nwhich the cause is removed.\u201d United States v. Rice, 327 U. S. 742,\n751. Once the Attorney General certifies scope of employment, trig\ngering removal of the case to a federal forum, \u00a72679(d)(2) renders the\nfederal court exclusively competent and categorically precludes a re\nmand to the state court. By declaring certification conclusive as to\nthe federal forum\u2019s jurisdiction, Congress has barred a district court\nfrom passing the case back to state court based on the court\u2019s dis\nagreement with the Attorney General\u2019s scope-of-employment deter\nmination.     Of the two antishuttling commands, \u00a71447(d) and\n4                           OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    \u00a72679(d)(2), only one can prevail and the Court holds that the latter\n    controls. Tailor-made for Westfall Act cases, \u00a72679(d)(2) \u201cconclu\n    sively\u201d determines that the action shall be adjudicated in the federal\n    forum, and may not be returned to the state system. Pp. 11\u201316.\n            (2) The Westfall Act\u2019s command that a district court retain ju\n    risdiction over a case removed pursuant to \u00a72679(d)(2) does not run\n    afoul of Article III. An Article III question could arise in this case\n    only if, after full consideration, the District Court determined that\n    Haley engaged in tortious conduct outside the scope of his employ\n    ment. Because, at that point, little would be left to adjudicate as to\n    his liability, and because a significant federal question (whether he\n    has Westfall Act immunity) would have been raised at the outset, the\n    case would \u201caris[e] under\u201d federal law as that term is used in Article\n    III. Even if only state-law claims remained after resolution of the\n    federal question, the District Court would have authority, consistent\n    with Article III, to retain jurisdiction. Pp. 16\u201317.\n       2. Westfall Act certification is proper when a federal officer charged\n    with misconduct asserts, and the Attorney General concludes, that\n    the incident or episode in suit never occurred. Pp. 17\u201324.\n          (a) Because the Westfall Act\u2019s purpose is to shield covered em\n    ployees not only from liability but from suit, it is appropriate to af\n    ford protection to an employee on duty at the time and place of an\n    \u201cincident\u201d alleged in a complaint who denies that the incident oc\n    curred. Just as the Government\u2019s certification that an employee \u201cwas\n    acting within the scope of his employment\u201d is subject to threshold ju\n    dicial review, Lamagno, 515 U. S., at 434, so a complaint\u2019s charge of\n    conduct outside the scope of employment, when contested, warrants\n    immediate judicial investigation. Otherwise, a federal employee\n    would be stripped of suit immunity not by what the court finds, but\n    by what the complaint alleges. This position is supported by Wil\n    lingham v. Morgan, 395 U. S. 402, which concerned 28 U. S. C.\n    \u00a71442, the federal officer removal statute. Section 1442 allows a fed\n    eral officer to remove a civil action from state court if the officer is\n    \u201csued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of\n    such office.\u201d The Court held in Willingham that the language of\n    \u00a71442 is \u201cbroad enough to cover all cases where federal officers can\n    raise a colorable defense arising out of the duty to enforce federal\n    law.\u201d 395 U. S., at 406\u2013407. There is no reason to conclude that the\n    Attorney General\u2019s ability to remove a suit to federal court under\n    \u00a72679(d)(2), unlike a federal officer\u2019s ability to remove under \u00a71442,\n    should be controlled by the plaintiff\u2019s allegations. Pp. 19\u201321.\n          (b) Tugging against this reading is a \u201cwho decides\u201d concern. If\n    the Westfall Act certification must be respected unless and until the\n    District Court determines that Haley, in fact, engaged in conduct be\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                     5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  yond the scope of his employment, then Osborn may be denied a jury\n  trial. Upon the Attorney General\u2019s certification, however, the action\n  is \u201cdeemed to be . . . brought against the United States,\u201d \u00a72679(d)(2),\n  and the Seventh Amendment, which preserves the right to a jury\n  trial in common-law suits, does not apply to proceedings against the\n  sovereign. Thus, at the time the district court reviews the Attorney\n  General\u2019s certification, the plaintiff has no right to a jury trial. The\n  Westfall Act\u2019s core purpose\u2014to relieve covered employees from the\n  cost and effort of defending the lawsuit and to place those burdens on\n  the Government\u2014also bears on the appropriate trier of any facts es\n  sential to certification. Immunity-related issues should be decided at\n  the earliest opportunity. See, e.g., Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U. S. 224,\n  228 (per curiam).

See 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72679(b)(1). When a federal employee is sued for wrongful\nor negligent conduct, the Act empowers the Attorney\nGeneral to certify that the employee \u201cwas acting within\nthe scope of his office or employment at the time of the\nincident out of which the claim arose.\u201d \u00a72679(d)(1), (2).\nUpon the Attorney General\u2019s certification, the employee is\ndismissed from the action, and the United States is substi\ntuted as defendant in place of the employee. The litigation\nis thereafter governed by the Federal Tort Claims Act\n(FTCA), 60 Stat. 842.

Today, we address three further questions regard\ning the Westfall Act\u2019s operation: (1) Is Attorney General\ncertification proper when a federal officer denies the oc\ncurrence of the tortious conduct alleged by the plaintiff; (2)\ndoes \u00a72679(d)(2), by rendering the Attorney General\u2019s\ncertification \u201cconclusiv[e] . . . for purposes of removal,\u201d bar\nremand even if the federal court determines that the\nUnited States should not be substituted as defendant in\nplace of the federal employee; and (3) does 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71447(d)\u2019s bar on appellate review of remand orders over\nride \u00a72679(d)(2)\u2019s direction that, for purposes of removal,\nthe Attorney General\u2019s certification is conclusive. The\nfirst two questions were advanced in the petition for cer\ntiorari; in our order granting review, we asked the parties\nto address the impact of \u00a71447(d) on this case.\n   Pat Osborn, plaintiff-petitioner in the civil action now\nbefore the Court, sued federal employee Barry Haley in a\nKentucky state court. She alleged that Haley tortiously\ninterfered with her employment with a private contractor\nand conspired to cause her wrongful discharge. Osborn\nfurther alleged that Haley\u2019s efforts to bring about her\ndischarge were outside the scope of his employment. The\nUnited States Attorney, serving as the Attorney General\u2019s\ndelegate, countered Osborn\u2019s allegations by certifying that\nHaley \u201cwas acting within the scope of his employment . . .\nat the time of the conduct alleged in [Osborn\u2019s] complaint.\u201d\nApp. to Brief in Opposition 23 (hereinafter Luber App.).\nBased on this certification, the case was removed to the\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of\nKentucky, as \u00a72679(d)(2) instructs.\n   In the federal forum, the United States Attorney denied\nthe tortious conduct Osborn attributed to Haley, asserting\nthat the wrongdoing she alleged never occurred. Accept\ning Osborn\u2019s allegations as true, the District Court entered\nan order that rejected the Attorney General\u2019s Westfall Act\ncertification, denied the Government\u2019s motion to substi\n                    Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntute the United States as defendant in place of Haley, and\nremanded the case to the state court. On appeal, the\nSixth Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s order, and in\nstructed that court to retain jurisdiction over the case.\n   We affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment. On the\nmerits, we agree with the Sixth Circuit that the District\nCourt, in denying substitution of the United States as\ndefendant in lieu of Haley, misconstrued the Westfall Act.\nSubstitution of the United States is not improper simply\nbecause the Attorney General\u2019s certification rests on an\nunderstanding of the facts that differs from the plaintiff\u2019s\nallegations. The United States, we hold, must remain the\nfederal defendant in the action unless and until the Dis\ntrict Court determines that the employee, in fact, and not\nsimply as alleged by the plaintiff, engaged in conduct\nbeyond the scope of his employment. On the jurisdictional\nissues, we hold that the Attorney General\u2019s certification is\nconclusive for purposes of removal, i.e., once certification\nand removal are effected, exclusive competence to adjudi\ncate the case resides in the federal court, and that court\nmay not remand the suit to the state court. We also hold\nthat \u00a71447(d)\u2019s bar on appellate review of remand orders\ndoes not displace \u00a72679(d)(2), which shields from remand\nan action removed pursuant to the Attorney General\u2019s\ncertification.\n                            I\n  Petitioner Pat Osborn worked for Land Between the\nLakes Association (LBLA), a private company that con\ntracted with the United States Forest Service to provide\nstaff for the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation\nArea in Kentucky.1 While employed by LBLA, Osborn\napplied for a trainee position with the Forest Service.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 We draw this account of the facts from the District Court\u2019s opinion\n\nand order denying reconsideration, supplemented by the allegations in\nOsborn\u2019s complaint.\n4                    OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRespondent Barry Haley, a Forest Service officer, was\nresponsible for the Service\u2019s hiring process. At a meeting\nwith LBLA employees, Haley announced that he had hired\nsomeone else for the job Osborn sought. Osborn asked\nwhy Haley did not inform her before the meeting, and she\nmade a joke at Haley\u2019s expense. After the meeting,\nOsborn\u2019s supervisor told her to apologize to Haley; she\nrefused.\n   A few weeks later, Osborn filed a complaint with the\nUnited States Department of Labor, asking the Depart\nment to investigate whether the Forest Service, in its\nhiring decision, had given appropriate consideration to the\nveterans\u2019 preference points to which she was entitled. The\nDepartment\u2019s investigator, Robert Kuenzli, after inter\nviewing Haley, concluded that the hiring procedure had\nbeen handled correctly. Kuenzli so informed Osborn, who\nthen asked him to close her complaint. On the same day\nLBLA\u2019s executive director, respondent Gaye Luber, sum\nmoned Osborn and demanded that she apologize to Haley\nfor \u201cnot being a good Forest Service partner.\u201d Complaint\n\u00b618, Luber App. 4. Osborn again refused. Two days later,\nshe was fired.\n   Osborn filed suit against Haley, Luber, and LBLA in a\nKentucky state court. She alleged that Haley tortiously\ninterfered with her employment relationship with LBLA\nand conspired to cause her wrongful discharge. Specifi\ncally, she charged that Haley maliciously induced Luber to\nfire her, and that Haley did so in retaliation for Osborn\u2019s\nDepartment of Labor complaint requesting a veterans\u2019\npreference inquiry. Complaint \u00b629, Luber App. 7. In\nresponse the local United States Attorney, invoking the\nWestfall Act, certified on behalf of the Attorney General\nthat Haley \u201cwas acting within the scope of his employment\nwith the U. S. Forest Service at the time of the conduct\nalleged in [Osborn\u2019s] complaint.\u201d Luber App. 23. As is\ncustomary, the certification stated no reasons for the\n                       Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                        5\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermination.2\n  In the Westfall Act, Congress instructed:\n     \u201cUpon certification by the Attorney General that the\n     defendant employee was acting within the scope of his\n     office or employment at the time of the incident out of\n     which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding\n     commenced upon such claim in a State court shall be\n     removed without bond at any time before trial by the\n     Attorney General to the district court of the United\n     States for the district and division embracing the\n     place in which the action or proceeding is pending.\n     Such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be an ac\n     tion or proceeding brought against the United States\n     under the provisions of this title and all references\n     thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as\n     the party defendant. This certification of the Attorney\n     General shall conclusively establish scope of office or\n     employment for purposes of removal.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n     \u00a72679(d)(2) (emphasis added).\nCiting this provision, as well as the federal officer removal\nstatute, \u00a71442,3 the United States removed the case to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The    certification read:\n       \u201cI, Monica Wheatley, Acting United States Attorney, Western Dis\ntrict of Kentucky, acting pursuant to the provisions of 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72679(d)(2), and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Appen\ndix to 28 C.F.R. \u00a715.3 (1990), hereby certify that the Office of the\nUnited States Attorney has reviewed the available facts in this matter.\nOn the basis of the information now available to me with respect to the\nallegations in the complaint, I find that the named federal defendant,\nBarry Haley, was acting within the scope of his employment with the\nU. S. Forest Service, at the time of the conduct alleged in the com\nplaint.\u201d Luber App. 23.\n    3 The federal officer removal statute provides that \u201c[a] civil action or\n\ncriminal prosecution commenced in a State court against\u201d \u201cany officer\n. . . of the United States . . . sued in an official or individual capacity for\nany act under color of such office\u201d \u201cmay be removed . . . to the district\ncourt of the United States for the district and division embracing the\n6                       OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of\nKentucky. The United States Attorney notified the Dis\ntrict Court that the United States should be substituted\nfor Haley as defendant, and filed a motion to dismiss on\nthe ground that Osborn had not exhausted administrative\nremedies, as required by the FTCA.\n   Osborn opposed the substitution and the motion to\ndismiss. She argued that Haley\u2019s conduct was outside the\nscope of his employment, hence the Westfall Act afforded\nhim no immunity. As support for her opposition, Osborn\nsubmitted a memorandum of understanding between the\nLBLA and the Forest Service, which cautioned Forest\nService employees against involvement in LBLA employ\nment decisions.\n   Apparently under the impression that the United\nStates, at that preliminary stage, did not dispute Osborn\u2019s\nfactual allegations, the District Court declined to conduct\nan evidentiary hearing. Under Kentucky law, the court\nobserved, if Osborn\u2019s allegations were true, Haley had\nacted outside the scope of his employment. In the District\nCourt\u2019s view the closeness in time of Osborn\u2019s request for a\nDepartment of Labor investigation, Kuenzli\u2019s call to Ha\nley, and Luber\u2019s demand for an apology justified an infer\nence that Haley interfered with Osborn\u2019s employment in\nviolation of the LBLA-Forest Service memorandum of\nunderstanding. So reasoning, the District Court overruled\nthe Westfall Act certification and denied substitution.\nUnder this ruling, the United States was no longer before\nthe court. Furthermore, the parties were not of diverse\ncitizenship and no federal law was at issue. The District\nCourt therefore held that it lacked subject-matter jurisdic\ntion over the case.4 Invoking \u00a71447(c),5 the court con\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nplace wherein it is pending.\u201d \u00a71442(a), (a)(1), (b).\n  4 The District Court did not address the propriety of removal under\n\n\u00a71442. See infra, at 20, n. 11.\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncluded that the case must be remanded to the state court.\n  The United States moved for reconsideration, urging\nthat, contrary to the District Court\u2019s impression, the Gov\nernment did contest Osborn\u2019s factual allegations. Recall\ning that it had denied Osborn\u2019s allegations in its answer to\nher complaint, the United States submitted sworn decla\nrations from Haley and Luber. Haley\u2019s stated that he was\nnot in communication with Luber between the time of\nKuenzli\u2019s investigation and Osborn\u2019s firing. Luber\u2019s decla\nration stated that Osborn\u2019s request for an investigation\nregarding her veterans\u2019 preference points could not have\nhad any bearing on Osborn\u2019s termination, for Luber was\nunaware of the request at the relevant time. Absent\ncontrary evidence, the Government maintained, these\ndeclarations sufficed to support the certification and the\ncontinuance of the United States as defendant in place\nof Haley. In the alternative, the Government sought\ndiscovery. 6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Section 1447(c) provides:\n   \u201cA motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after\nthe filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a). If at any time\nbefore final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject\nmatter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. An order remanding\nthe case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses,\nincluding attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal. A certified\ncopy of the order of remand shall be mailed by the clerk to the clerk of\nthe State court. The State court may thereupon proceed with such\ncase.\u201d\n   6 The District Court refused to entertain the alternative argument\n\nthat, if a relevant Haley-Luber conversation did occur, Haley was\nacting within the scope of his employment. Because Haley had de\nclared, under oath, that he did not communicate with Luber, the court\nwas unwilling to allow discovery on the question whether, if Haley did\ncontact Luber, he was acting within the scope of his employment. But\ncf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(e)(2) (subject to Rule 11 obligations, parties\nmay plead claims or defense \u201calternately or hypothetically\u201d). We\nexpress no opinion on the propriety of the District Court\u2019s refusal to\nconsider the Government\u2019s alternative pleading.\n8                     OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court denied the Government\u2019s reconsid\neration motion. The Haley and Luber declarations, the\ncourt said, clarified that the controversy centered on\nwhether there had been any communication between\nHaley and Luber influencing Luber\u2019s decision to fire\nOsborn. The Westfall Act would have shielded Haley, the\nCourt suggested, had the United States admitted a Haley-\nLuber communication but defended its content as within\nthe scope of Haley\u2019s employment. Westfall Act certifica\ntion was improper, the court concluded, because the\nUnited States did not admit, but instead denied, the oc\ncurrence of the event central to proof of Osborn\u2019s claim.\nThe District Court acknowledged disagreement among the\nCircuits on the availability of a Westfall Act certification\nwhen the United States \u201cden[ies] the occurrence of the\nbasic incident charged.\u201d Wood v. United States, 995 F. 2d\n1122, 1124 (CA1 1993) (en banc). Compare ibid. and\nMcHugh v. University of Vermont, 966 F. 2d 67, 74\u201375\n(CA2 1992) (prohibiting incident-denying certifications),\nwith Heuton v. Anderson, 75 F. 3d 357, 360 (CA8 1996);\nKimbro v. Velten, 30 F. 3d 1501, 1508 (CADC 1994); and\nMelo v. Hafer, 13 F. 3d 736, 746\u2013747 (CA3 1994) (allowing\nincident-denying certifications). Choosing to follow the\nFirst Circuit\u2019s opinion in Wood, the District Court adhered\nto its prior ruling that the Westfall Act certification in this\ncase was invalid.\n   On appeal, the Sixth Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s\norder denying certification and substitution. 422 F. 3d\n359, 365 (2005). The Court of Appeals, in accord with\nHeuton, Kimbro, and Melo, held that a Westfall Act certifi\ncation is not improper simply because the United States\ndenies the occurrence of the incident on which the plaintiff\ncentrally relies. 422 F. 3d, at 364. Rather, the court held,\nwhere \u201cthe Attorney General\u2019s certification is based on a\ndifferent understanding of the facts than is reflected in the\ncomplaint, including a denial of the harm-causing inci\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndent, the district court must resolve the factual dispute.\u201d\nIbid. (quoting Melo, 13 F. 3d, at 747).\n   The Sixth Circuit also vacated the District Court\u2019s order\nremanding the case to the state court. Section 2679(d)(2),\nthe Court of Appeals stressed, instructs that the \u201ccertifica\ntion of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish\nscope of office or employment for purposes of removal.\u201d\nThe court read that instruction to proscribe shuttling\ncases back to state courts and, instead, to require district\ncourt adjudication of the controversy even when a Westfall\nAct certification is rejected and, correspondingly, substitu\ntion of the United States as defendant is denied. 422\nF. 3d, at 365. On that issue too, the Court of Appeals\nnoted a division among the Circuits. Compare Borneman\nv. United States, 213 F. 3d 819, 826 (CA4 2000); Garcia v.\nUnited States, 88 F. 3d 318, 325\u2013327 (CA5 1996); and\nAliota v. Graham, 984 F. 2d 1350, 1356 (CA3 1993) (hold\ning that a district court lacks authority to remand a case\nremoved under \u00a72679(d)(2)), with Haddon v. United\nStates, 68 F. 3d 1420, 1427 (CADC 1995); and Nasuti v.\nScannell, 906 F. 2d 802, 814, n. 17 (CA1 1990) (holding\nremand proper when district court rejects the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s certification). We granted certiorari. 547 U. S.\n__ (2006).\n                              II\n  We consider first the Court of Appeals\u2019 jurisdiction to\nreview the District Court\u2019s disposition of this case. We\naddress in turn the questions whether the appellate court\nhad jurisdiction to review (1) the order rejecting the At\ntorney General\u2019s certification and denying substitution of\nthe United States as defendant, and (2) the order remand\ning the case to the state court.\n                             A\n  The District Court\u2019s rejection of certification and substi\ntution effectively denied Haley the protection afforded by\n10                        OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Westfall Act, a measure designed to immunize covered\nfederal employees not simply from liability, but from suit.\nSee \u00a72(a)(5), 102 Stat. 4563; Lamagno, 515 U. S., at 425\u2013\n426; H. R. Rep. No. 100\u2013700, p. 4 (1988). Under the col\nlateral order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial\nLoan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949), this ruling qualifies as a\nreviewable final decision within the compass of 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71291.7\n  Meeting the three criteria of Cohen, the District Court\u2019s\ndenial of certification and substitution conclusively de\ncided a contested issue, the issue decided is important and\nseparate from the merits of the action, and the District\nCourt\u2019s disposition would be effectively unreviewable later\nin the litigation. 337 U. S., at 546. See Mitchell v. For\nsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 525\u2013527 (1985) (holding that district\ncourt rejection of a defendant\u2019s qualified immunity plea is\nimmediately appealable under the Cohen doctrine because\nsuit immunity \u201cis effectively lost if a case is erroneously\npermitted to go to trial\u201d against the immune official). As\ncogently explained by the Fifth Circuit in Mitchell v. Carl\nson, 896 F. 2d 128, 133 (1990), retaining the federal em\nployee as a party defendant\n     \u201ceffectively denie[s] [him] immunity from suit if [he]\n     was entitled to such immunity under the Westfall Act.\n     Under the Act, once the United States Attorney certi\n     fies that the federal employee acted within the scope\n     of [his] employment, the plaintiff properly can proceed\n     only against the United States as defendant. The fed\n     eral employee remains immune from suit. By [reject\n     ing the Attorney Genera\u2019s certification], the district\n     court subject[s] [the employee] to the burden of de\n     fending a suit . . ., a burden from which [the Westfall\n     Act spares him].\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Section 1291 provides that \u201c[t]he courts of appeals . . . shall have\n\njurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

See Woodruff v. Covington, 389 F. 3d 1117, 1124\n(CA10 2004); Mathis v.

We confirm that the Courts of Appeals have ruled\ncorrectly on this matter.\n                              B\n   In our order granting certiorari we asked the parties to\naddress, in addition to the issues presented in the petition,\nthis further question: Did the Court of Appeals have juris\ndiction to review the District Court\u2019s remand order, not\nwithstanding 28 U. S. C. \u00a71447(d)\u2019s declaration that \u201c[a]n\norder remanding a case to the State court from which it\nwas removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise\u201d?\nIn answering this question, we also resolve the second\nquestion presented in the petition for certiorari\u2014whether\nthe Westfall Act\u2019s rule against remanding actions removed\npursuant to \u00a72679(d)(2) applies when the federal court\ndetermines that the United States should not be substi\ntuted as defendant in place of the federal employee. Our\ndisposition is informed by, and tracks, the Third Circuit\u2019s\nreasoning in Aliota, 984 F. 2d, at 1354\u20131357.\n   We begin with the provision we asked the parties to\naddress: \u00a71447(d). That provision states in relevant part:\n\u201cAn order remanding a case to the State court from which\nit was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise\n12                       OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n. . . .\u201d In Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423\nU. S. 336 (1976), we held that the preceding subsection,\n\u00a71447(c), confined \u00a71447(d)\u2019s scope. Under \u00a71447(d), the\nCourt explained, \u201conly remand orders issued under\n\u00a71447(c) and invoking the [mandatory] grounds specified\ntherein\u2014that removal was improvident and without\njurisdiction\u2014are immune from review.\u201d Id., at 346.8\nThermtron had been properly removed to the federal court.\nThe sole reason the District Court gave for remanding it\nwas that court\u2019s crowded docket. This Court held the\nremand order reviewable, observing that \u00a71447(c) could\nnot sensibly be read to confer on the district courts \u201ccarte\nblanche authority . . . to revise the federal statutes govern\ning removal.\u201d Id., at 351. See also Quackenbush v.\nAllstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706 (1996) (holding abstention-\nbased remand order immediately appealable). But see\nGravitt v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 430 U. S. 723\n(1977) (per curiam) (holding unreviewable a remand order\npurporting to rest on a ground within the scope of\n\u00a71447(c)).\n    The United States urges us to apply Thermtron and hold\nthe remand order in this case reviewable because that\norder was not based on a ground specified in \u00a71447(c). To\ndetermine whether Thermtron controls, we must start\nwith an examination of the Westfall Act\u2019s design, particu\nlarly its prescriptions regarding the removal and remand\nof actions filed in state court.\n    As earlier noted, see supra, at 1, the Act grants the\nAttorney General authority to certify that a federal em\nployee named defendant in a tort action was acting within\nthe scope of his or her employment at the time in question.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 At the time Thermtron was decided, \u00a71447(c) required a district\n\ncourt to remand a case if it appeared that the case had been \u201cremoved\nimprovidently and without jurisdiction.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71447(c) (1970\ned.). Section 1447(c) now provides that a case must be remanded if \u201cit\nappears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a72679(d)(1), (2). If the action is commenced in a federal\ncourt, and the Attorney General certifies that the em\nployee \u201cwas acting within the scope of his office or em\nployment at the [relevant] time,\u201d the United States must\nbe substituted as the defendant. \u00a72679(d)(1). If the action\nis launched in a state court, and the Attorney General\nmakes the same certification, the action \u201cshall be re\nmoved\u201d to the appropriate federal district court, and again\nthe United States must be substituted as the defendant.\n\u00a72679(d)(2).     Of prime importance to our decision,\n\u00a72679(d)(2) concludes with the command: \u201cTh[e] certifica\ntion of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish\nscope of office or employment for purposes of removal.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.)\n   This directive markedly differs from Congress\u2019 instruc\ntion for cases in which the Attorney General \u201crefuse[s] to\ncertify scope of office or employment.\u201d \u00a72679(d)(3). In that\nevent, the defendant employee may petition the court in\nwhich the action was instituted to make the scope-of\nemployment certification. If the complaint was filed in a\nstate court, the Attorney General may remove the case to\nthe appropriate federal court, but he is not obliged to do\nso. Ibid. If the court, state or federal, issues the certifica\ntion, \u201cthe United States shall be substituted as the party\ndefendant.\u201d Ibid. If removal has occurred, and thereafter\n\u201cthe district court determines that the employee was not\nacting within the scope of his office or employment, the\naction . . . shall be remanded to the State court.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis added).\n   The Act\u2019s distinction between removed cases in which\nthe Attorney General issues a scope-of-employment certifi\ncation, and those in which he does not, leads us to con\nclude that Congress gave district courts no authority to\nreturn cases to state courts on the ground that the Attor\nney General\u2019s certification was unwarranted. Absent\ncertification, \u00a72679(d)(3) directs that the case must be\n14                       OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nremanded to the state court in which the action com\nmenced. In contrast, when the Attorney General certifies\nscope of employment, his certificate \u201cconclusively estab\nlish[es] scope of office or employment for purposes of re\nmoval.\u201d \u00a72679(d)(2) (emphasis added). Section 2679(d)(2)\ndoes not preclude a district court from resubstituting the\nfederal official as defendant for purposes of trial if the\ncourt determines, postremoval, that the Attorney Gen\neral\u2019s scope-of-employment certification was incorrect. For\npurposes of establishing a forum to adjudicate the case,\nhowever, \u00a72679(d)(2) renders the Attorney General\u2019s certi\nfication dispositive.9\n   Were it open to a district court to remand a removed\naction on the ground that the Attorney General\u2019s certifica\ntion was erroneous, the final instruction in \u00a72679(d)(2)\nwould be weightless. The Attorney General\u2019s certification\nwould not \u201cconclusively establish scope of office or em\nployment\u201d for either trial or removal. Instead, the Attor\nney General\u2019s scope certification would supply only a\ntentative basis for removal, rather than a conclusive one.\nIn Lamagno, the Court unanimously agreed that Congress\nspoke unambiguously on this matter: Congress adopted\nthe \u201cconclusiv[e] . . . for purposes of removal\u201d language to\n\u201cforeclose needless shuttling of a case from one court to\nanother.\u201d 515 U. S., at 433, n. 10; see id., at 440 (SOUTER,\nJ., dissenting) (\u201c[T]here is nothing equivocal about\n[\u00a72679(d)(2)\u2019s] provision that once a state tort action has\nbeen removed to a federal court after a certification by the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 As explained by the Third Circuit in Melo v. Hafer, 912 F. 2d 628,\n641 (1990), \u201c[t]here are significant policy reasons why Congress would\nchoose to give the government an unchallengeable right to have a\nfederal forum for tort suits brought against its employees.\u201d But Con\ngress\u2019 endeavor to secure that right does not mean that Congress also\nintended to render unreviewable substitution of the United States as\ndefendant in place of the employee. See ibid.; cf. Gutierrez de Martinez\nv. Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 430\u2013434 (1995).\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAttorney General, it may never be remanded to the state\nsystem.\u201d).\n   With the Westfall Act\u2019s provisions on removal of actions\nfiled in state court in clear view, we return to the question\nwhether an order remanding a case removed pursuant to\n\u00a72679(d)(2) is reviewable. Thermtron held that \u00a71447(d)\nmust be read together with \u00a71447(c). There is stronger\ncause, we conclude, to hold that \u00a71447(c) and (d) must be\nread together with the later enacted \u00a72679(d)(2). Both\n\u00a71447(d) and \u00a72679(d)(2) are antishuttling provisions.\nEach aims to prevent \u201cprolonged litigation of questions of\njurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is\nremoved.\u201d United States v. Rice, 327 U. S. 742, 751 (1946).\nSection 2679(d)(2) is operative when the Attorney General\ncertifies scope of employment, triggering removal of the\ncase to a federal forum. At that point, \u00a72679(d)(2) renders\nthe federal court exclusively competent and categorically\nprecludes a remand to the state court.\n   The command that the Attorney General\u2019s certification\n\u201cshall conclusively establish scope of office or employment\nfor purposes of removal,\u201d \u00a72679(d)(2), differentiates certi\nfied Westfall Act cases from the typical case remanded for\nwant of subject-matter jurisdiction. Ordinarily, when the\nplaintiff moves to remand a removed case for lack of sub\nject-matter jurisdiction, the federal district court under\ntakes a threshold inquiry; typically the court determines\nwhether complete diversity exists or whether the com\nplaint raises a federal question. In Attorney General\ncertified Westfall Act cases, however, no threshold deter\nmination is called for; the Attorney General\u2019s certificate\nforecloses any jurisdictional inquiry. By declaring the\nAttorney General\u2019s certification \u201cconclusive\u201d as to the\nfederal forum\u2019s jurisdiction, Congress has barred a district\ncourt from passing the case back to the state court where\nit originated based on the court\u2019s disagreement with the\nAttorney General\u2019s scope-of-employment determination.\n16                   OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Our decision that \u00a72679(d)(2) leaves the district court\nwithout authority to send a certified case back to the state\ncourt scarcely means that whenever the district court\nmisconstrues a jurisdictional statute, appellate review of\nthe remand is in order. Such an exception would, of\ncourse, collide head on with \u00a71447(d), and with our prece\ndent. See, e.g., Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516\nU. S. 124, 127\u2013128 (1995). Only in the extraordinary case\nin which Congress has ordered the intercourt shuttle to\ntravel just one way\u2014from state to federal court\u2014does\ntoday\u2019s decision hold sway.\n  In short, of the two antishuttling commands, \u00a71447(d)\nand \u00a72679(d)(2), only one can prevail. We hold that\n\u00a72679(d)(2) controls. Tailor-made for Westfall Act cases,\n\u00a72679(d)(2) is a forum-selecting rule Congress made \u201ccon\nclusive,\u201d beyond the ken of district courts to revise. See\nThermtron, 423 U. S., at 351.\n                               C\n   In Lamagno, the Court considered, but did not defini\ntively resolve, the question whether Article III permits\n\u201c[t]reating the Attorney General\u2019s certification as conclu\nsive for purposes of removal but not for purposes of substi\ntution.\u201d 515 U. S., at 434. It was argued in that case that\nif certification is rejected and substitution denied \u201cbecause\nthe federal court concludes that the employee acted out\nside the scope of his employment, and if the tort plaintiff\nand the [defendant-employee] are not of diverse citizen\nship, . . . then the federal court will be left with a case\nwithout a federal question to support the court\u2019s subject-\nmatter jurisdiction.\u201d Id., at 434\u2013435. Lamagno was an\naction commenced in federal court on the basis of diversity\nof citizenship, so there was in that case \u201cnot even the\nspecter of an Article III problem.\u201d Id., at 435.\n   In the case before us, the question would arise only if,\nafter full consideration, the District Court determines that\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nHaley in fact engaged in the tortious conduct outside the\nscope of his employment charged in Osborn\u2019s complaint.\nAt that point, however, little would be left to adjudicate, at\nleast as to Haley\u2019s liability. Because a significant federal\nquestion (whether Haley has Westfall Act immunity)\nwould have been raised at the outset, the case would\n\u201caris[e] under\u201d federal law, as that term is used in Article\nIII. See Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461\nU. S. 480, 493 (1983). Even if only state-law claims re\nmained after resolution of the federal question, the Dis\ntrict Court would have discretion, consistent with Article\nIII, to retain jurisdiction. See Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v.\nCohill, 484 U. S. 343, 350\u2013351 (1988) (when federal char\nacter of removed case is eliminated while the case is sub\njudice, court has discretion to retain jurisdiction, to re\nmand, or to dismiss); cf. Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S.\n715, 725 (1966) (pendent jurisdiction may be exercised\nwhen federal and state claims have a \u201ccommon nucleus of\noperative fact\u201d and would \u201cordinarily be expected to [be\ntried] all in one judicial proceeding\u201d). See also 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71367 (\u201cSupplemental jurisdiction\u201d). \u201c[C]onsiderations of\njudicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants,\u201d\nGibbs, 383 U. S., at 726, make it reasonable and proper for\na federal court to proceed to final judgment, once it has\ninvested time and resources to resolve the pivotal scope-of\nemployment contest. Thus, under the precedent that\nguides us, the Westfall Act\u2019s command that a district court\nretain jurisdiction over a case removed pursuant to\n\u00a72679(d)(2) does not run afoul of Article III.\n\n                               III\n  With the jurisdictional issues resolved, we reach the\nprincipal question raised by petitioner Osborn: whether\nthe United States Attorney validly certified that Haley\n\u201cwas acting within the scope of his employment . . . at the\n18                   OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntime of the conduct alleged in the complaint.\u201d Luber App.\n23. We note first that the certificate is formally in order;\nit closely tracks the language of the Westfall Act. See\n\u00a72679(d)(2) (authorizing certification \u201cthat the defendant\nemployee was acting within the scope of his office or em\nployment at the time of the incident out of which the claim\narose\u201d). In Lamagno, we held that the Attorney General\u2019s\ncertification is \u201cthe first, but not the final word\u201d on\nwhether the federal officer is immune from suit and, cor\nrelatively, whether the United States is properly substi\ntuted as defendant. 515 U. S., at 432. A plaintiff may\nrequest judicial review of the Attorney General\u2019s scope-of\nemployment determination, as Osborn did here.\n   As earlier recounted, see supra, at 6, the District Court\ninitially accepted Osborn\u2019s allegations as true because it\nbelieved that the United States did not dispute them.\nApplying Kentucky law, that court determined that \u201cHa\nley\u2019s alleged actions occurred outside the scope of his\nemployment.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a. In a motion for\nreconsideration, the Government clarified that, far from\nadmitting Osborn\u2019s allegations, it disputed the very occur\nrence of the harm-causing conduct Osborn alleged. In\nsupport of the motion, the Government submitted affida\nvits from Haley and Luber denying that they engaged in\nthe conduct ascribed to them in Osborn\u2019s complaint. The\nGovernment contended that Haley remained within the\nproper bounds of his employment at the relevant time\nand place because the wrongdoing Osborn alleged never\nhappened.\n   The Government\u2019s reconsideration motion asked the\nDistrict Court to resolve the factual dispute, i.e., to deter\nmine whether, as the complaint alleged, Haley prevailed\nupon Luber to discharge Osborn, or whether, as Haley\nasserted, he never communicated with Luber about\nOsborn\u2019s LBLA employment. The court did not grant the\nGovernment\u2019s request for resolution of the factual dispute.\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nInstead, it held the Westfall Act certification invalid pre\ncisely because the Government denied that Haley engaged\nin harm-causing conduct.\n   Two Courts of Appeals have held that Westfall Act\ncertification is improper when the Government denies the\noccurrence of the alleged injury-causing action or episode.\nSee Wood, 995 F. 2d, at 1123 (CA1); McHugh, 966 F. 2d, at\n74\u201375 (CA2). The Sixth Circuit, in this case, and several\nother Courts of Appeals have held that a plaintiff\u2019s allega\ntion of conduct beyond the scope of a federal official\u2019s\nemployment does not block certification where the Gov\nernment contends that the alleged tortious conduct did not\noccur. See Heuton, 75 F. 3d, at 360 (CA8); Kimbro, 30\nF. 3d, at 1508 (CADC); Melo, 13 F. 3d, at 746\u2013747 (CA3).\nWe agree that Westfall Act certification is proper when a\nfederal officer charged with misconduct asserts, and the\nGovernment determines, that the incident or episode in\nsuit never occurred.\n                               A\n   The Westfall Act grants a federal employee suit immu\nnity, we reiterate, when \u201cacting within the scope of his\noffice or employment at the time of the incident out of\nwhich the claim arose.\u201d \u00a72679(d)(1), (2). That formula\ntion, we are persuaded, encompasses an employee on duty\nat the time and place of an \u201cincident\u201d alleged in a com\nplaint who denies that the incident occurred. See Wood,\n995 F. 2d, at 1134 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and\nBoudin, JJ., dissenting) (\u201c[S]urely the statute applies with\nthe same force whether a postal service driver says that he\ndid not hit the plaintiff's car or that he did so but was not\nat fault.\u201d); Melo, 13 F. 3d, at 747. And just as the Gov\nernment\u2019s certification that an employee \u201cwas acting\nwithin the scope of his employment\u201d is subject to threshold\njudicial review, Lamagno, 515 U. S., at 434, so a com\nplaint\u2019s charge of conduct outside the scope of employ\n20                        OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nment, when contested, warrants immediate judicial inves\ntigation. Were it otherwise, a federal employee would be\nstripped of suit immunity not by what the court finds, but\nby what the complaint alleges.10\n   In sum, given the purpose of the Westfall Act to shield\ncovered employees not only from liability but from suit, it\nis altogether appropriate to afford protection to a \u201cnegli\ngent . . . employee . . . as a matter of course.\u201d Wood, 995\nF. 2d, at 1135 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin,\nJJ., dissenting). But it would make scant sense to read\nthe Act as leaving an employee charged with an inten\ntional tort11 to fend for himself when he denies wrongdoing\nand asserts he \u201cengaged only in proper behavior occurring\nwholly within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d Ibid.\nSee also Hueton, 75 F. 3d, at 360 (\u201c[I]t is illogical to as\nsume that Congress intended to protect guilty employees\nbut desert innocent ones.\u201d).12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 In an opinion resembling his majority opinion in Wood v. United\n\nStates, 995 F. 2d 1122 (CA1 1993) (en banc), JUSTICE BREYER takes the\nview that the Attorney General may issue a Westfall Act certification if\nhe contests the plaintiff\u2019s account of the episode-in-suit, but he must\n\u201cassume some kind of incident\u201d in order to certify. Post, at 2. Thus he\nwould not permit \u201cpurely incident-denying certifications,\u201d and he places\nthe certification here in that category. Ibid. We agree with the Wood\ndissenters\u2019 appraisal of JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s distinction between incident-\ndenying and incident-recharacterizing certifications: That approach\nwould require district courts \u201cto engage in difficult, time-wasting\ncontroversies . . . about precisely which facts pertaining to the scope of\nemployment issue are for the district judge and which are for the jury.\u201d\n995 F. 2d, at 1136, and n. 7 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin,\nJJ., dissenting).

C. \u00a71442, supports our reading of the Westfall Act.13\nSection 1442(a)(1) allows an officer of the United States to\nremove a civil action commenced in state court if the\nofficer is \u201csued in an official or individual capacity for any\nact under color of such office.\u201d In Willingham, a federal\ninmate sued two federal prison officials in state court,\nalleging that they had assaulted, beaten, and tortured\nhim. 395 U.

The Tenth Circuit reversed, reading\n\u00a71442(a)(1) to permit removal only when a defendant\n\u201cexclude[s] the possibility that the suit is based on acts or\nconduct not justified by his federal duty.\u201d Morgan v.\nWillingham, 383 F. 2d 139, 141 (1967).

In Willingham, the federal officer\u2019s \u201crelationship to\n[the plaintiff] derived solely from their official duties.\u201d\nIbid. Similarly here, Haley interacted with Osborn and\nLuber only through his employment as a Forest Service\nofficer.14 For purposes of removal under \u00a71442(a), the\ndefendants in Willingham were not required to accept the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 In the context of \u00a71442, we have held that, to qualify for removal, a\n\nfederal official must show \u201ca nexus . . . between the charged conduct\nand asserted official authority.\u201d Jefferson County v. Acker, 527 U. S.\n423, 431 (1999) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We\nneed not today decide whether qualification for Westfall Act immunity\nis similarly limited, for in this case, a nexus plainly exists connecting\nthe incident Osborn alleged and Haley\u2019s federal employment. We note,\nhowever, that nothing in our opinion commits the Court to the view\nthat Westfall Act immunity is available in fanciful situations like the\none JUSTICE BREYER hypothesizes, post, at 1\u20132, in which the plaintiff\u2019s\nallegations are wholly unrelated to the defendant\u2019s federal employment.\n   JUSTICE BREYER posits the case of a Yellowstone Park forest ranger\naccused of misdeeds at Coney Island. He says we would find Westfall\nAct immunity\u2014more accurately, we would uphold Westfall Act certifi\ncation\u2014even if the ranger\u2019s \u201cpresen[ce] on Coney Island must have\nbeen . . . on a frolic of his own.\u201d Post, at 1. If JUSTICE BREYER is imagin\ning a case in which the ranger was in fact on a frolic at Coney Island,\nbut the Attorney General nevertheless issued a Westfall Act certificate,\nwe would not approve the certification. In that imaginary case, there\nwould be no sense in which the ranger was acting within the scope of\nhis employment at the time of the incident charged in the plaintiff\u2019s\ncomplaint. If, instead, JUSTICE BREYER has in mind a ranger accused of\nfrolicking at Coney Island, when all the while he stayed close to his\ndesk at Yellowstone Park, then JUSTICE BREYER is correct: Westfall Act\nimmunity might be available under our approach. If such a case ever\nshows up in a federal court, however, the district judge might be called\nupon to determine whether removal and substitution under \u00a72679(d)(2)\nare limited by a nexus requirement similar to the one that limits\nremoval under \u00a71442.\n                      Cite as: 549 U.

So here,\nfor purposes of removal under \u00a72679(d)(2), Haley and the\nGovernment were not required to accept as true Osborn\u2019s\nallegations that Haley \u201cmaliciously induced\u201d her dismissal\nfrom LBLA \u201cin retaliation for plaintiff filing a veterans\u2019\npreference inquiry.\u201d Complaint \u00b629, Luber App. 7. Haley,\nlike the defendant in Willingham, may have been on frolic\nof his own as Osborn alleged, and therefore may not be\nentitled to immunity. But like the officers in Willingham,\nhe should have the opportunity to \u201cpresent [his] version of\nthe facts to a federal . . . court.\u201d 395 U. S., at 409.\n                             B\n   Tugging against our reading of the Westfall Act, we\nrecognize, is a \u201cwho decides\u201d concern. If the Westfall Act\ncertification must be respected unless and until the Dis\ntrict Court determines that Haley, in fact, engaged in\nconduct beyond the scope of his employment, then Osborn\nmay be denied a jury trial. Compare Wood, 995 F. 2d, at\n1126, 1130, with id., at 1134\u20131138 (joint opinion of Coffin,\nSelya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting). Should the District\nCourt find that Haley did not maliciously induce Luber to\ndischarge Osborn, but instead interacted with Luber and\nOsborn only within the proper bounds of his employment,\nOsborn will lose on the merits with no access to a jury of\nher peers.15 \u201cThis is not a small objection,\u201d for the issue\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 The overlap of certification validity and the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s\nclaim, evident here, is uncommon. It is unlikely to occur when the\nplaintiff alleges negligent conduct. The question whether a federal\ndriver was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of an\naccident, for example, can generally be answered without simultane\nously determining whether the federal employee drove negligently or\ncarefully. And even when the plaintiff alleges an intentional tort, it\nmay be possible to resolve the scope-of-employment question without\n24                         OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cthat goes to the heart of the merits, as well as to the\nvalidity of the certificate,\u201d will likely turn on the credibil\nity of Osborn, Haley, and Luber, and credibility \u201cmay be\nwell suited for jury resolution.\u201d See id., at 1136\u20131137.16\n   Under the Westfall Act, however, Congress supplanted\nthe jury in covered cases. See \u00a72679(d)(1)\u2013(3). Upon\ncertification, the action is \u201cdeemed to be . . . brought\nagainst the United States,\u201d ibid., unless and until the\ndistrict court determines that the federal officer originally\nnamed as defendant was acting outside the scope of his\nemployment. The Seventh Amendment, which preserves\nthe right to a jury trial in suits at common law, we have\nheld, does not apply to proceedings against the sovereign.\nLehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156 (1981). See also \u00a72402\n(actions against the United States ordinarily \u201cshall be\ntried by the court without a jury\u201d). Thus, at the time the\ndistrict court reviews the Attorney General\u2019s certification,\nthe plaintiff has no right to a jury trial. See Kimbro, 30\nF. 3d, at 1509, n. 4.17\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndeciding the merits of the claim. If a plaintiff charges a federal em\nployee with sexual assault, for example, upon determining that there\nwas sexual contact, a district court could find that the employee acted\noutside the scope of his duties, leaving the question whether the contact\nwas consensual for jury resolution.\n   16 But cf. 995 F. 2d, at 1137 (observing that \u201c[i]n the ordinary tort\n\nclaim arising when a government driver negligently runs into another\ncar, jury trial is precisely what is lost to a plaintiff when the govern\nment is substituted for the employee\u201d).\n   17 We do not address the case in which the Attorney General refuses\n\ncertification. In that event, \u00a72679(d)(3) allows the named defendant to\n\u201cpetition the court to find and certify that [he] was acting within the\nscope of his . . . employment.\u201d However, the Westfall Act gives the\nnamed defendant no right to remove an uncertified case. But see 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71442(a)(1). That right is accorded to the Attorney General\nonly. Because the scope determination would be made in such a case\nbefore any substitution of the United States as defendant takes place, it\nis arguable that a jury trial of that issue would be required if the case is\nbefore a federal court.

Nothing in our opinion touches\non that relationship in the typical case in which a defendant official\nraises a defense of absolute or qualified immunity. We simply observe\nthat the Westfall Act grants federal employees a species of immunity,\nand that, under our jurisprudence, immunity-related questions should\nbe resolved at the earliest opportunity. JUSTICE BREYER is right,\nhowever, to this extent. We recognize that judges have a greater\nfactfinding role in Westfall Act cases than they traditionally have in\nother immunity contexts. The Act makes that inevitable. When\nWestfall Act immunity is in dispute, a district court is called upon to\ndecide who the proper defendant is: the named federal employee, or the\nUnited States. That decision cannot be left for jury resolution late in\nproceedings without undermining the Westfall Act\u2019s very purpose: to\nshift the burden of defending the suit to the United States whenever\nthe defendant-employee was, at the relevant time, acting within the\nscope of his employment.\n                   Cite as: 549 U.

C. \u00a71447(d) provides, with one exception not\nrelevant here, that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the\nState court from which it was removed is not reviewable\non appeal or otherwise.\u201d In sanctioning appellate review\nnotwithstanding \u00a71447(d), the Court relies on its determi\nnation that Congress, through \u00a72679(d)(2), has prohibited\nremand in cases like this one, in order to give effect to the\nconclusive character of the Attorney General\u2019s certification\non the issue of removal jurisdiction. But as we recently\nheld, \u201c \u2018review is unavailable no matter how plain the legal\nerror in ordering the remand.\u2019 \u201d Kircher v. Putnam Funds\nTrust, 547 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 7) (quoting\nBriscoe v. Bell, 432 U. S. 404, 414, n. 13 (1977)). Thus,\nrather than allowing \u00a72679(d)(2) to trump \u00a71447(d), I\nwould reaffirm the rule that a district court\u2019s remand\norder is unreviewable even if it is based on an erroneous\nunderstanding of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.1 But I\nwould not otherwise limit the Attorney General\u2019s (or the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The exception to \u00a71447(d) created in Thermtron Products, Inc. v.\n\nHermansdorfer, 423 U.

HALEY\n\n                         Opinion of SOUTER, J.\n\nemployee\u2019s) efforts to give the intended effect to the certifi\ncation prior to any remand that might be ordered.\n  I agree with the Court, therefore, that the Court of\nAppeals had jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s\norder resubstituting Haley as defendant. That order was\nnot \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from\nwhich it was removed,\u201d so by its own terms \u00a71447(d) does\nnot apply to review of that decision. Allowing review of a\nresubstitution order makes good on the promise of the\nWestfall Act: by permitting disaggregation of a remand\norder from a substantive determination about substitution\nthat preceded it (in the manner exemplified by Waco v.\nUnited States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 293 U. S. 140\n(1934)), it gives an employee-defendant a right to appeal\nany denial of the benefit of substituting the Government\nas defendant in costly litigation arising out of the em\nployee\u2019s federal service.2 The circumstances in which the\nWestfall Act was adopted, responding as it did to a series\nof our decisions that Congress saw as having \u201cseriously\neroded the common law tort immunity previously avail\nable to Federal employees,\u201d 102 Stat. 4563, note following\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72671, point to the importance Congress placed\non giving a federal employee a full opportunity to seek this\nprotection. Incidentally, of course, my reading of the\nstatutes can give an appellate court the opportunity to\ncorrect a district court\u2019s erroneous understanding of the\nlegitimacy of removal before any remand is effected, mak\ning it very unlikely that a mistakenly premised remand\norder will be carried out.

S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 11, n. 13).

The policy of avoiding litigation over remands is\ntempered by allowing appeals on the important matter of\nsubstitution. The policy behind making the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s certification conclusive is qualified by insulating\na remand order from review, no matter how erroneous its\njurisdictional premise. Neither policy has it all, but each\ngets something.\n  I would remand this case to the Court of Appeals for\nproceedings consistent with this understanding.\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

But I dissent from\nPart III. I continue to believe that the Westfall Act per\nmits the Attorney General to certify only when accepting,\nat least conditionally, the existence of some kind of \u201cinci\ndent.\u201d But where the incident, if it took place at all, must\nhave fallen outside the scope of employment, the Act does\nnot permit certification. See Wood v. United States, 995\nF. 2d 1122 (CA1 1993) (en banc).\n  Here, the Attorney General did claim, in the alternative,\nthat if an incident took place (i.e., if the federal employee\nHaley spoke to Osborn\u2019s employer with respect to Osborn\u2019s\nemployment), any such incident would have fallen within\nthe scope of Haley\u2019s employment. But, for procedural\nreasons, that alternative claim is not before us. Ante, at 7,\nn. 6. Hence I must consider this case as if it were quite a\ndifferent kind of case, one in which what took place was\neither an incident outside the scope of employment or no\nincident at all. Consider, for example, an aggravated\nsexual assault, a theft of personal property, or an auto\naccident on Coney Island where the Government em\nployee, say a Yellowstone Park forest ranger, if present on\nConey Island must have been there on a frolic of his own.\n2                    OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nThe majority\u2019s approach finds Westfall Act immunity in\ncases of this kind. I would not.\n   For one thing, the Act\u2019s language suggests that it does\nnot apply in such circumstances. The statute says that\nthe Attorney General must certify that the employee \u201cwas\nacting within the scope of his office or employment at the\ntime of the incident out of which the claim arose.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72679(d)(2) (emphasis added). The italicized\nwords, read naturally, assume some kind of incident, the\ncharacterization of which (e.g., as within the scope of\nemployment) determines whether immunity attaches. By\nway of contrast, permitting purely incident-denying certi\nfications, as the majority does, can only be squared with\nthe Act\u2019s text if the Attorney General is required to supply\nthe reviewing court with proof of what the employee was\ndoing (and that such activities were within the scope of\nemployment) \u201cat the time of the incident\u201d\u2014a showing that\nwould prove quite difficult in a case such as this, where\nthe plaintiff has alleged that the tort was committed at\nsome unknown time over a period of days, or weeks, or\neven longer.\n   For another, there is nothing to suggest the Westfall Act\nsought to provide immunity for tort claims necessarily\nfalling outside the scope of federal employment. As its\npopular name suggests, the Act focused upon Westfall v.\nErwin, 484 U. S. 292 (1988), an earlier case in which the\nCourt considered whether, to obtain immunity from state-\nlaw tort suits, a federal official had to show not just that\nhis conduct was \u201cwithin the scope of [his] employment,\u201d\nbut also that it was \u201cdiscretionary in nature.\u201d Id., at 295\n(emphasis added). The Court answered \u201cyes.\u201d It held that\na federal employee was not immune from a state-law tort\nsuit, even for simple negligence, unless the employee could\nalso show that his conduct was discretionary.\n   The Westfall Act basically seeks to overturn this hold\ning. As this Court has said, \u201c[w]hen Congress wrote the\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)             3\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nWestfall Act . . . , the legislators had one purpose firmly in\nmind [namely] to override Westfall v. Erwin.\u201d Gutierrez de\nMartinez v. Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 425 (1995). The\nHouse Judiciary Committee wrote that the Act\u2019s \u201cfunc\ntional effect . . . is to return Federal employees to the\nstatus they held prior to the Westfall decision.\u201d H. R. Rep.\nNo. 100\u2013700, p. 4 (1988). And that \u201cstatus,\u201d many thought,\nwas an immunity that applied to nondiscretionary, as well\nas discretionary, actions that fell \u201cwithin the scope\u201d of the\nemployee\u2019s \u201coffice or employment.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72679(b)(1);\nH. R. Rep. No. 100\u2013700, at 4.\n   In a word, the Act seeks to maintain the scope of pre-\nWestfall immunity minus Westfall\u2019s \u201cdiscretionary func\ntion\u201d limitation. That purpose does not encompass an\nextension of immunity to all-or-nothing conduct, i.e., those\nserious assaults or personal \u201cfrolics\u201d that, if they took place\nat all, could not possibly have fallen within the scope of\nthe employee\u2019s \u201coffice or employment.\u201d\n   Further, to try to bring the latter type of conduct within\nthe scope of the Act\u2019s immunity creates a series of anoma\nlies. As the Court recognizes, its interpretation may limit\nthe plaintiff\u2019s ability to obtain jury consideration of factual\nmatters critical to his or her case. Indeed, any Govern\nment employee defendant, including a defendant whom\nthe Attorney General does not want to defend, can ask the\njudge to issue a certificate. \u00a72679(d)(3). On the Court\u2019s\nview of the statute, the issuance of the certificate could\ndepend upon whether, for example, the aggravated sexual\nassault took place at all or whether the defendant was at\nYellowstone or Coney Island at the relevant times. And,\nin deciding these questions (as the judge would have to do\nto determine whether the certificate should issue), the\njudge, not the jury, would decide the main issue in the\ncase. (The Court declines to address the effect of its\nanalysis on \u00a72679(d)(3). Ante, at 24, n. 17. But the rele\nvant language in this provision is virtually identical to the\n4                    OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nlanguage at issue in this case, see \u00a72679(d)(2), so one\ncannot seriously suggest that the Act by its own terms\naffords employees any narrower a basis for seeking certifi\ncation than it affords the Attorney General.)\n   It is highly unusual to permit special, speedy judge fact-\nfinding where immunity is at issue. Ordinarily, when a\nparty asserts an immunity defense, i.e., an \u201centitlement\nnot to stand trial under certain circumstances,\u201d Mitchell v.\nForsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 525 (1985) (emphasis added),\nspecial immunity-related procedures focus, not upon fact-\nfinding, but upon the proper legal characterization of the\nfacts as given. Where the parties\u2019 immunity-related dis\nagreement amounts to a dispute about the law, namely\nwhether the particular set of facts alleged by the plaintiff\ndoes, or does not, fall within the immunity\u2019s legal scope,\nthe defendant is entitled to a quick determination of the\nlegal question by the trial judge and, if necessary, an\nimmediate interlocutory appeal. Id., at 526, 530. See\nNixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 742\u2013743 (1982); see\nalso Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U. S. 500, 507\u2013508 (1979).\nBut where that disagreement amounts to a dispute about\nthe facts, immunity law does not ordinarily entitle the\ndefendant to special procedural treatment. Rather, the\ndefendant must take the facts as the plaintiff asserts\nthem. Like any other defendant, he can move for sum\nmary judgment. Mitchell, supra, at 526; Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U. S. 635, 646\u2013647, n. 6 (1987). But if the\nplaintiff provides sufficient evidence to survive summary\njudgment, the defendant must win the case at trial.\n   Thus ordinarily an immunity defense provides special\nprocedural treatment only for a defendant\u2019s legal claim\nthat the facts taken as the plaintiff asserts them (or taken\nas the assertions have survived a motion for summary\njudgment) fall within the scope of the immunity. It does\nnot provide special treatment for disputes about the facts.\nSee, e.g., Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 319\u2013320 (1995)\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            5\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n(defendant raising immunity defense \u201cmay not appeal a\ndistrict court\u2019s summary judgment order insofar as that\norder determines whether or not the pretrial record sets\nforth a \u2018genuine\u2019 issue of fact for trial\u201d). The Court\u2019s read\ning of the Westfall Act works a major change in this\nfact/law relationship. Under the Court\u2019s reading, the\ndefendant will have the right to ask the judge to deter\nmine the facts, i.e., to determine whether the events plain\ntiff says occurred did in fact happen. And that is so even\nwhere the plaintiff has enough evidence to bring the case to\nthe jury.\n   The Court\u2019s reading of the Act proves even more anoma\nlous in the case of a federal employee claiming an assault\nthat violates both (a) state tort law and (b) federal civil\nrights law. Suppose that the defendant\u2019s sole defense is\n\u201cmistaken identity.\u201d The defendant argues that nothing\ntook place between him and the plaintiff, that at the rele\nvant time he was working peacefully at his desk. Under\nthe Court\u2019s reading, the defendant is entitled to have the\njudge decide the factual question; and, should the judge\ndecide in his favor (in respect to the state-law tort claim),\ncollateral estoppel likely means an end of the matter in\nrespect to the federal civil rights claim, as well. Yet the\nWestfall Act explicitly exempts from its scope any claim of\n\u201cviolation of a federal statute\u201d or the Federal Constitution.\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72679(b)(2).\n   The Court rests much of its analysis on Willingham v.\nMorgan, 395 U. S. 402 (1969), but I do not think that case\noffers much support. Willingham addressed only a federal\nofficer\u2019s right to remove a case to federal court (via\n\u00a71442(a)(1)). Id., at 403. Once there, the officer could\npursue traditional immunity defenses, i.e., based on the\nfacts as alleged by the plaintiff or as they survived sum\nmary judgment; that is all the Court could have meant\nwhen it said that officers \u201cshould have the opportunity to\npresent their version of the facts to a federal, not a state,\n6                     OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ncourt,\u201d id., at 409. Moreover, in Mesa v. California, 489\nU. S. 121, 139 (1989), this Court held that \u201c[f]ederal officer\nremoval under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71442(a) must be predicated\nupon averment of a federal defense.\u201d Because the federal\nemployee defendants in Mesa \u201cha[d] not and could not\npresent an official immunity defense\u201d to the charges\nagainst them, removal was improper under \u00a71442(a)(1).\nId., at 133. The majority reads the Westfall Act much\nmore broadly than this Court read \u00a71442(a) in Mesa,\npermitting removal in cases where there is unquestionably\nno official immunity defense available (at least as such\ndefenses have been understood by this Court until today).\nAnd in so doing, the majority opens wide the door not just\nto removal, which was all that was at issue in Willingham\nand Mesa, but, much more consequentially, to substituting\na judge\u2019s factfinding for a plaintiff\u2019s jury trial right.\n   I do not claim that my own reading of the Westfall Act\nwill totally eliminate the difficulties I have mentioned.\nBut an interpretation that reads the Act\u2019s language more\nliterally will minimize them, while also largely mitigating\nthe problem of clever pleading with which the majority is\nrightly concerned, ante, at 20. The Act says the \u201cAttorney\nGeneral\u201d must certify that the \u201cemployee was acting\nwithin the scope of his office or employment at the time of\nthe incident out of which the claim arose.\u201d \u00a72679(d)(2)\n(emphasis added). As I have said, that language prevents\nthe Attorney General from denying that any \u201cincident\u201d at\nall occurred without at least adding in the alternative that\nany incident the plaintiff might be able to show falls\nwithin the employee\u2019s scope of employment regardless.\n   Thus, if a plaintiff claims an intentional touching (out\nside the scope of employment), the Attorney General is\nfree to claim (a) there was no touching but (b) were the\nevidence to show a touching, it was accidental (within the\nscope of employment). Yet if the plaintiff accuses the\nemployee, a Yellowstone Park ranger, of negligent driving\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            7\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\non Coney Island, the Attorney General could not make a\nsimilar claim. (Nor could he likely do so in respect to an\nemployee whom the plaintiff claims committed a serious\nsexual assault.) That is because if these latter incidents\ndid happen, they must have fallen outside the scope of\nemployment, while if they did not happen, then nothing\ninvolving the employee happened at all. In such cases no\nWestfall Act immunity would be available. And that is\njust as it should be.\n  This approach resembles, but differs in important re\nspects from that of the First Circuit in Wood. In Wood, the\nFirst Circuit held that a judge reviewing a Westfall Act\ncertificate could resolve factual conflicts as to \u201cincident\ndescribing and incident-characterizing facts,\u201d but must\nleave for the jury (if it came to that) disputes over whether\nany incident occurred at all. 995 F. 2d, at 1129. Here, I\noffer a compromise between Wood and the majority\u2019s more\nextreme approach. I would permit a judge reviewing a\nWestfall Act certificate to resolve any factual disputes\nrelevant to whether the defendant was \u201cacting within the\nscope of his office or employment,\u201d including, when neces\nsary, determining whether the incident occurred at all.\nBut I would only permit the judge to fulfill this factfinding\nfunction in those cases where the Attorney General (or the\ndefendant employee, under \u00a72679(d)(3)) can offer some\nplausible explanation of the alleged incident that would\nbring the defendant\u2019s actions within the scope of his fed\neral office or employment.\n  The majority\u2019s approach, absent some undefined con\nstraint that might be imposed in future cases, ante, at 22,\nn. 14, would permit factfinding by a judge (and, where the\nAttorney General requests, removal to federal court) in\nany state-law tort case involving a federal employee. I\nwould permit judges to fulfill this rather extraordinary\nfactfinding function only in those cases where the \u201cinjury\nor loss of property, or personal injury or death\u201d for which\n8                    OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthe plaintiff seeks recovery might have \u201caris[en] or re\nsult[ed] from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of\n[the federal employee] while acting within the scope of his\noffice or employment\u201d\u2014i.e., where there is some chance\nthe injury (if any) was caused by the kinds of actions for\nwhich the Act expressly grants employees immunity,\nunder \u00a72679(b)(1). This approach protects the innocent\nemployee as well as the guilty, ante, at 20, but only in the\nclass of law suits the Act can plausibly be read to cover.\n  Because the Court of Appeals interpreted the Act as\ndoes the Court, I would vacate its judgment. I would,\nhowever, permit the Court of Appeals to consider the\nGovernment\u2019s alternative assertion of immunity (including\nwhether it was properly barred by the trial court), and to\ndetermine whether Westfall Act immunity applies on that\nbasis.\n  For these reasons, I dissent from Part III of the Court\u2019s\nopinion.\n                    Cite as: 549 U.

Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S. 336, 343 (1976). It is,\nmoreover, not just hortatory; it is jurisdictional. Things\nRemembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U. S. 124, 127\u2013128\n(1995). Yet beginning in 1976, this Court has repeatedly\neroded \u00a71447(d)\u2019s mandate and expanded the Court\u2019s\njurisdiction. Today\u2019s opinion eviscerates what little re\nmained of Congress\u2019s Court-limiting command.\n                            I\n  The first narrowing of \u00a71447(d) occurred in Thermtron\nProducts, over the dissent of Justice Rehnquist joined by\nChief Justice Burger and Justice Stewart (only eight\nJustices sat in the case). Thermtron Products held that\nremand orders are reviewable if they are based on any\ngrounds other than the mandatory ground for remand set\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The remaining clause of \u00a71447(d) provides an exception that is not\napplicable here: \u201cexcept that an order remanding a case to the State\ncourt from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this title\nshall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.\u201d\n2                        OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nforth in \u00a71447(c)\u2014namely, that \u201c \u2018the case was removed\nimprovidently and without jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d 2 423 U.

Thus, the unlimited phrase\n\u201c[a]n order remanding a case\u201d magically became \u201can order\nremanding a case under this section\u201d\u2014changing prior law,\nunder which the Court had held that the predecessors of\n\u00a71447(d) prohibited review of all remand orders. See id.,\nat 354\u2013356 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Since, in Therm\ntron Products, the District Court had remanded solely\nbecause of its crowded docket, we accepted review and\nissued a writ of mandamus compelling reconsideration of\nthe order. See also Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517\nU. S. 706, 710\u2013712 (1996) (reviewing a remand order\npredicated on abstention under Burford v. Sun Oil Co.,\n319 U. S. 315 (1943)).3\n   The next phase in \u00a71447(d)\u2019s erosion came just last\nTerm, in Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust, 547 U. S. ___\n(2006). There, as here, the District Court had remanded\nto state court \u201con the ground that [it] lacked subject mat\nter jurisdiction on removal.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3).\nThat should have been the end of the matter, but it was\nnot. The Kircher majority embarked on a searching in\nquiry into whether the District Court\u2019s real reason for\nremand was lack of jurisdiction. See id., at ___ (slip op., at\n7\u201311). In my concurrence, I warned that \u201c[r]eview of the\nsort engaged in . . . threatens to defeat the purpose of\n\u00a71447(d),\u201d which was \u201c \u2018to prevent delay in the trial of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Section 1447(c) has since been amended, specifying as grounds for\n\nmandatory remand that \u201cthe district court lacks subject matter\njurisdiction.\u201d\n  3 The Thermtron Products limitation upon the \u00a71447(d) bar to appel\n\nlate review does not affect this case. As the Court recognizes, ante, at\n6, the District Court was perfectly clear that its remand to state court\nwas based on its lack of jurisdiction.\n                   Cite as: 549 U.

Whether the District Court was\n    right or wrong\u2014even if it was so badly mistaken that\n    it misunderstood the true basis for its orders\u2014it pur\n    ported to remand for lack of jurisdiction, and \u00a71447(d)\n    bars any further review.\u201d Kircher, 547 U. S., at ___\u2013\n    ___ (slip op., at 2\u20133).\n  Today\u2019s opinion goes even further than Kircher.\nWhereas that case at least claimed to be applying our\nprecedents, see, e.g., id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 7\u20138) (citing\nBriscoe v. Bell, 432 U. S. 404, 413\u2013414, n. 13 (1977)),\ntoday\u2019s opinion makes no such pretense. Having recog\nnized, as it must, that the District Court in this case in\nvoked \u00a71447(c) and remanded for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction, ante, at 6, the Court nevertheless reaches the\namazing conclusion that \u00a71447(d) does not \u201ccontro[l]\u201d\nwhether the remand order is reviewable on appeal. Ante,\nat 16.\n  How can that be? How can a statute explicitly eliminat\ning appellate jurisdiction to review a remand order not\n\u201ccontro[l]\u201d whether an appellate court has jurisdiction to\nreview a remand order? The Court says the answer to this\nriddle lies in 28 U. S. C. \u00a72679(d)(2). But that section says\nonly that the Attorney General\u2019s certification is \u201cconclu\nsiv[e] . . . for purposes of removal\u201d (emphasis added); it\nsays absolutely nothing about the reviewability of remand\norders. Thus, the most \u00a72679(d)(2) can prove is that the\nDistrict Court should not have remanded the case; that its\nremand order was erroneous. But our precedents make\nabundantly clear that \u00a71447(d)\u2019s appellate-review bar\n4                         OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\napplies with full force to erroneous remand orders. Just\nlast Term we acknowledged that \u201ca remand premised on\nan erroneous conclusion of no jurisdiction is unappeal\nable.\u201d Kircher, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 8). See also\nThermtron Products, supra, at 343 (\u201cIf a trial judge pur\nports to remand a case on the ground that it was removed\n\u2018improvidently and without jurisdiction,\u2019 his order is not\nsubject to challenge in the court of appeals by appeal, by\nmandamus, or otherwise\u201d (quoting \u00a71447(c) (1975 ed.)\n(emphasis added)); Briscoe, supra, at 414, n. 13 (where a\nremand order is based on one of the grounds enumerated\nin \u00a71447(c), \u201creview is unavailable no matter how plain\nthe legal error in ordering the remand\u201d). Today\u2019s opinion\nrepudiates that principle. The only basis for its holding is\nthat \u00a72679(d)(2) renders the remand erroneous. This\nutterly novel proposition, that a remand order can be set\naside when it is contrary to law, leaves nothing remaining\nof \u00a71447(d). Determination of an order\u2019s lawfulness can\nonly be made upon review\u2014and it is precisely review that\n\u00a71447(d) forbids.4\n   Congress knows how to make remand orders reviewable\nwhen it wishes to do so.

C. \u00a7487(d) (\u201c[T]he United\nStates shall have the right to appeal from any order of\nremand in the case\u201d). Even \u00a71447(d) itself exempts certain\nremand orders from its own appellate-review bar.

Unlike the Court,\nhowever, I choose not to address the point in dicta. See ante, at 16\u201317\n(noting that \u201cthe question would only arise if\u201d certain events take place,\nyet answering the question anyway).\n                  Cite as: 549 U.

As the Court recognized in\nKircher, \u201c[t]here is no such \u2018clear statutory command\u2019 here,\nand that silence tells us we must look to 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71447(d) to determine the reviewability of remand orders\nunder the Act.\u201d 547 U. S., at ___, n. 8 (slip op., at 7, n. 8).\nWere the Court in this case to look to \u00a71447(d), instead of\nlooking for a way around \u00a71447(d), the answer would be\nabundantly clear.\n                              II\n   Respondents argued that, even if the remand order is\nunreviewable on appeal, the District Court\u2019s rejection of\nthe Attorney General\u2019s certification should be reviewable\nas a logically distinct determination, citing Waco v. United\nStates Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 293 U. S. 140 (1934). See\nante, at 1\u20132 (SOUTER, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part) (adopting this argument).\n   The continuing vitality of Waco is dubious in light of\nmore recent precedents, see Kircher, supra, at ___, n. 13\n(slip op., at 11, n. 13). We need not address that question\nhere, however, since Waco is patently inapposite. There,\nremoval had been premised on diversity jurisdiction. The\nDistrict Court dismissed the party whose citizenship was\nalleged to supply the requisite diversity, finding that\nparty\u2019s joinder improper, and thus remanded the case for\nlack of jurisdiction. We found the dismissal order to be\nreviewable on appeal, even though the remand order was\nnot. 293 U. S., at 143. But there is a crucial distinction\nbetween that case and this one: In Waco, reversal of the\ndismissal would not have subverted the remand. There\nwas no question that the suit would proceed in state court\nregardless of whether the diverse party was rightfully or\nwrongfully dismissed. Nowhere did the Waco Court so\n6                     OSBORN v. HALEY\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmuch as hint that the District Court might need to reex\namine its remand order; to the contrary, it was clear that\nthe remand would occur, no matter what: \u201cIf the District\nCourt\u2019s [dismissal] order stands, the cross-action will be no\npart of the case which is remanded to the state court. . . . A\nreversal cannot affect the order of remand, but it will at\nleast, if the dismissal of the petitioner\u2019s complaint was\nerroneous, remit the entire controversy, with the [diverse\nparty] still a party, to the state court for such further\nproceedings.\u201d Id., at 143\u2013144 (emphasis added). In other\nwords, the remand order and the dismissal order were\ntruly \u201cseparate orders,\u201d id., at 142; we could review\u2014even\nreverse\u2014the dismissal order without affecting the remand\nor its impact on the case.\n   Today\u2019s case far more closely resembles Kircher. There,\nthe remand order had been predicated upon a finding that\nthe cause of action was not a \u201ccovered\u201d class-action suit as\ndefined by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards\nAct of 1998 (SLUSA), 112 Stat. 3227, and therefore that\nthe federal courts lacked jurisdiction. The District Court\nremanded so the suit could continue in state court, outside\nthe confines of SLUSA. If the suit had been \u201ccovered,\u201d\nSLUSA would have precluded the action from going for\nward in any court, state or federal. 15 U. S. C. \u00a777p(b).\nWe therefore determined that neither the remand itself\nnor the determination of SLUSA inapplicability was re\nviewable on appeal: \u201cThe District Court\u2019s remand order\nhere cannot be disaggregated as the Waco orders could,\nand if [we were to find the suit to be covered by SLUSA],\nthere [would be] nothing to remand to state court.\u201d 547\nU. S., at ___\u2013___, n. 13 (slip op., at 11\u201312, n. 13). That is\nprecisely the situation in this case: The remand here is\npredicated upon a finding that the United States should\nnot be substituted as a defendant under the Westfall Act.\nIf we were to disagree with the District Court and substi\ntute the United States as a defendant, while at the same\n                  Cite as: 549 U.

United States. But the state\ncourt would have to dismiss such a case at once, since\nfederal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over FTCA suits.\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71346(b)(1). Thus, as in Kircher, but unlike\nWaco, the District Court\u2019s decision on the preliminary\nmatter\u2014here, Westfall Act certification; in Kircher,\nSLUSA applicability\u2014is inextricably intertwined with the\nremand order. Since that is so, there is no jurisdiction to\nreview either determination.\n                          *     *    *\n   In an all-too-rare effort to reduce the high cost of litiga\ntion, Congress provided that remand orders are completely\nunreviewable \u201con appeal or otherwise.\u201d Section 1447(d)\neffectuated a tradeoff of sorts: Even though Congress\nundoubtedly recognized that some remand orders would\nbe entered in error, it thought that, all in all, justice would\nbetter be served by allowing that small minority of cases\nto proceed in state courts than by subjecting every re\nmanded case to endless rounds of forum disputes. \u201c[B]y\ndenying any form of review of an order of remand,\u201d \u201cCon\ngress . . . established the policy of not permitting inter\nrupting of the litigation of the merits of a removed cause\nby prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the\ndistrict court to which the cause is removed.\u201d United\nStates v. Rice, 327 U. S. 742, 751 (1946). Today, in its\nuncompromising pursuit of technical perfection at all\ncosts, this Court has repealed the tradeoff.

Roberts, Whitlow, Roberts, Houston &amp; Straub, PLLC, Paducah, KY, Counsel for Respondents.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, commonly known as the Westfall Act, accords federal employees absolute immunity from common-law tort claims arising out of acts they undertake in the course of their official duties. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(1). When a federal employee is sued for wrongful or negligent conduct, the Act empowers the Attorney General to certify that the employee \"was acting within the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*888</span> scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.\" \u00a7 2679(d)(1), (2). Upon the Attorney General's certification, the employee is dismissed from the action, and the United States is substituted as defendant in place of the employee. The litigation is thereafter governed by the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 60 Stat. 842. If the action commenced in state court, the case is to be removed to a federal district court, and the certification remains \"conclusiv[e] ... for purposes of removal.\" \u00a7 2679(d)(2).</p>\n<p>In <i>Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117955\"><a href=\"/opinion/117955/gutierrez-de-martinez-v-lamagno/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 420, 115 S.Ct. 2227, 132 L.Ed.2d 375 (1995), we held that the Attorney General's Westfall Act scope-of-employment certification is subject to judicial review. Today, we address three further questions regarding the Westfall Act's operation: (1) Is Attorney General certification proper when a federal officer denies the occurrence of the tortious conduct alleged by the plaintiff; (2) does \u00a7 2679(d)(2), by rendering the Attorney General's certification \"conclusiv[e] ... for purposes of removal,\" bar remand even if the federal court determines that the United States should not be substituted as defendant in place of the federal employee; and (3) does 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)'s bar on appellate review of remand orders override \u00a7 2679(d)(2)'s direction that, for purposes of removal, the Attorney General's certification is conclusive. The first two questions were advanced in the petition for certiorari; in our order granting review, we asked the parties to address the impact of \u00a7 1447(d) on this case.</p>\n<p>Pat Osborn, plaintiff-petitioner in the civil action now before the Court, sued federal employee Barry Haley in a Kentucky state court. She alleged that Haley tortiously interfered with her employment with a private contractor and conspired to cause her wrongful discharge. Osborn further alleged that Haley's efforts to bring about her discharge were outside the scope of his employment. The United States Attorney, serving as the Attorney General's delegate, countered Osborn's allegations by certifying that Haley \"was acting within the scope of his employment... at the time of the conduct alleged in [Osborn's] complaint.\" App. to Brief in Opposition 23 (hereinafter Luber App.). Based on this certification, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, as \u00a7 2679(d)(2) instructs.</p>\n<p>In the federal forum, the United States Attorney denied the tortious conduct Osborn attributed to Haley, asserting that the wrongdoing she alleged never occurred. Accepting Osborn's allegations as true, the District Court entered an order that rejected the Attorney General's Westfall Act certification, denied the Government's motion to substitute the United States as defendant in place of Haley, and remanded the case to the state court. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit vacated the District Court's order, and instructed that court to retain jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p>We affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment. On the merits, we agree with the Sixth Circuit that the District Court, in denying substitution of the United States as defendant in lieu of Haley, misconstrued the Westfall Act. Substitution of the United States is not improper simply because the Attorney General's certification rests on an understanding of the facts that differs from the plaintiff's allegations. The United States, we hold, must remain the federal defendant in the action unless and until the District Court determines that the employee, <i>in fact,</i> and not simply as alleged by the plaintiff, engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment. On the jurisdictional issues, we hold that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*889</span> for purposes of removal, <i>i.e.,</i> once certification and removal are effected, exclusive competence to adjudicate the case resides in the federal court, and that court may not remand the suit to the state court. We also hold that \u00a7 1447(d)'s bar on appellate review of remand orders does not displace \u00a7 2679(d)(2), which shields from remand an action removed pursuant to the Attorney General's certification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Pat Osborn worked for Land Between the Lakes Association (LBLA), a private company that contracted with the United States Forest Service to provide staff for the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area in Kentucky.<sup>[1]</sup> While employed by LBLA, Osborn applied for a trainee position with the Forest Service. Respondent Barry Haley, a Forest Service officer, was responsible for the Service's hiring process. At a meeting with LBLA employees, Haley announced that he had hired someone else for the job Osborn sought. Osborn asked why Haley did not inform her before the meeting, and she made a joke at Haley's expense. After the meeting, Osborn's supervisor told her to apologize to Haley; she refused.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, Osborn filed a complaint with the United States Department of Labor, asking the Department to investigate whether the Forest Service, in its hiring decision, had given appropriate consideration to the veterans' preference points to which she was entitled. The Department's investigator, Robert Kuenzli, after interviewing Haley, concluded that the hiring procedure had been handled correctly. Kuenzli so informed Osborn, who then asked him to close her complaint. On the same day LBLA's executive director, respondent Gaye Luber, summoned Osborn and demanded that she apologize to Haley for \"not being a good Forest Service partner.\" Complaint \u00b6 18, Luber App. 4. Osborn again refused. Two days later, she was fired.</p>\n<p>Osborn filed suit against Haley, Luber, and LBLA in a Kentucky state court. She alleged that Haley tortiously interfered with her employment relationship with LBLA and conspired to cause her wrongful discharge. Specifically, she charged that Haley maliciously induced Luber to fire her, and that Haley did so in retaliation for Osborn's Department of Labor complaint requesting a veterans' preference inquiry. Complaint \u00b6 29, Luber App. 7. In response the local United States Attorney, invoking the Westfall Act, certified on behalf of the Attorney General that Haley \"was acting within the scope of his employment with the U.S. Forest Service at the time of the conduct alleged in [Osborn's] complaint.\" Luber App. 23. As is customary, the certification stated no reasons for the determination.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In the Westfall Act, Congress instructed:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Upon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*890</span> was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a State court shall be removed without bond at any time before trial by the Attorney General to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place in which the action or proceeding is pending. Such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be an action or proceeding brought against the United States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant. <i>This certification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.</i>\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>Citing this provision, as well as the federal officer removal statute, \u00a7 1442,<sup>[3]</sup> the United States removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. The United States Attorney notified the District Court that the United States should be substituted for Haley as defendant, and filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that Osborn had not exhausted administrative remedies, as required by the FTCA.</p>\n<p>Osborn opposed the substitution and the motion to dismiss. She argued that Haley's conduct was outside the scope of his employment, hence the Westfall Act afforded him no immunity. As support for her opposition, Osborn submitted a memorandum of understanding between the LBLA and the Forest Service, which cautioned Forest Service employees against involvement in LBLA employment decisions.</p>\n<p>Apparently under the impression that the United States, at that preliminary stage, did not dispute Osborn's factual allegations, the District Court declined to conduct an evidentiary hearing. Under Kentucky law, the court observed, if Osborn's allegations were true, Haley had acted outside the scope of his employment. In the District Court's view the closeness in time of Osborn's request for a Department of Labor investigation, Kuenzli's call to Haley, and Luber's demand for an apology justified an inference that Haley interfered with Osborn's employment in violation of the LBLA-Forest Service memorandum of understanding. So reasoning, the District Court overruled the Westfall Act certification and denied substitution. Under this ruling, the United States was no longer before the court. Furthermore, the parties were not of diverse citizenship and no federal law was at issue. The District Court therefore held that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case.<sup>[4]</sup> Invoking \u00a7 1447(c),<sup>[5]</sup> the court concluded that the case must be remanded to the state court.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*891</span> The United States moved for reconsideration, urging that, contrary to the District Court's impression, the Government did contest Osborn's factual allegations. Recalling that it had denied Osborn's allegations in its answer to her complaint, the United States submitted sworn declarations from Haley and Luber. Haley's stated that he was not in communication with Luber between the time of Kuenzli's investigation and Osborn's firing. Luber's declaration stated that Osborn's request for an investigation regarding her veterans' preference points could not have had any bearing on Osborn's termination, for Luber was unaware of the request at the relevant time. Absent contrary evidence, the Government maintained, these declarations sufficed to support the certification and the continuance of the United States as defendant in place of Haley. In the alternative, the Government sought discovery.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The District Court denied the Government's reconsideration motion. The Haley and Luber declarations, the court said, clarified that the controversy centered on whether there had been any communication between Haley and Luber influencing Luber's decision to fire Osborn. The Westfall Act would have shielded Haley, the Court suggested, had the United States admitted a Haley-Luber communication but defended its content as within the scope of Haley's employment. Westfall Act certification was improper, the court concluded, because the United States did not admit, but instead denied, the occurrence of the event central to proof of Osborn's claim. The District Court acknowledged disagreement among the Circuits on the availability of a Westfall Act certification when the United States \"den[ies] the occurrence of the basic incident charged.\" <i>Wood v.

The Court of Appeals, in accord with <i>Heuton, Kimbro,</i> and <i>Melo,</i> held that a Westfall Act certification is not improper simply because the United States denies the occurrence of the incident on which the plaintiff centrally relies. 422 F.3d, at 364. Rather, the court held, where \"the Attorney General's certification is based on a different understanding of the facts than is reflected in the complaint, including a denial of the harm-causing incident, the district court must resolve the factual dispute.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*892</span> <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Melo,</i> 13 F.3d, at 747).</p>\n<p>The Sixth Circuit also vacated the District Court's order remanding the case to the state court. Section 2679(d)(2), the Court of Appeals stressed, instructs that the \"certification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.\" The court read that instruction to proscribe shuttling cases back to state courts and, instead, to require district court adjudication of the controversy even when a Westfall Act certification is rejected and, correspondingly, substitution of the United States as defendant is denied. 422 F.3d, at 365.

In answering this question, we also resolve the second question presented in the petition for certiorari\u0097whether the Westfall Act's rule against remanding actions removed pursuant to \u00a7 2679(d)(2) applies when the federal court determines that the United States should not be substituted as defendant in place of the federal employee. Our disposition is informed by, and tracks, the Third Circuit's reasoning in <i>Aliota,</i> 984 F.2d, at 1354-1357.</p>\n<p>We begin with the provision we asked the parties to address: \u00a7 1447(d).

To determine whether <i>Thermtron</i> controls, we must start with an examination of the Westfall Act's design, particularly its prescriptions regarding the removal and remand of actions filed in state court.</p>\n<p>As earlier noted, see <i>supra,</i> at 887-888, the Act grants the Attorney General authority to certify that a federal employee named defendant in a tort action was acting within the scope of his or her employment at the time in question. \u00a7 2679(d)(1), (2). If the action is commenced in a federal court, and the Attorney General certifies that the employee \"was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the [relevant] time,\" the United States must be substituted as the defendant. \u00a7 2679(d)(1). If the action is launched in a state court, and the Attorney General makes the same certification, the action \"shall be removed\" to the appropriate federal district court, and again the United States must be substituted as the defendant. \u00a7 2679(d)(2). Of prime importance to our decision, \u00a7 2679(d)(2) concludes with the command: \"Th[e] certification of the Attorney General shall <i>conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.</i>\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>This directive markedly differs from Congress' instruction for cases in which the Attorney General \"refuse[s] to certify scope of office or employment.\" \u00a7 2679(d)(3). In that event, the defendant employee may petition the court in which the action was instituted to make the scope-of-employment certification. If the complaint was filed in a state court, the Attorney General <i>may</i> remove the case to the appropriate federal court, but he is not obliged to do so. <i>Ibid.</i> If the court, state or federal, issues the certification, \"the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant.\" <i>Ibid.</i> If removal has occurred, and thereafter \"the district court determines that the employee was not acting within the scope of his office or employment, the action . . . <i>shall be remanded to the State court.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The Act's distinction between removed cases in which the Attorney General issues a scope-of-employment certification, and those in which he does not, leads us to conclude that Congress gave district courts no authority to return cases to state courts on the ground that the Attorney General's certification was unwarranted. Absent certification, \u00a7 2679(d)(3) directs that the case must be remanded to the state court in which the action commenced. In contrast, when the Attorney General certifies scope of employment, his certificate \"conclusively establish[es] scope of office or employment <i>for purposes of removal.</i>\" \u00a7 2679(d)(2) (emphasis added). Section 2679(d)(2) does not preclude a district court from resubstituting the federal official as defendant <i>for purposes of trial</i> if the court determines, postremoval, that the Attorney General's scope-of-employment certification was incorrect. For purposes of establishing a forum to adjudicate the case, however, \u00a7 2679(d)(2) renders the Attorney General's certification dispositive.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*895</span> Were it open to a district court to remand a removed action on the ground that the Attorney General's certification was erroneous, the final instruction in \u00a7 2679(d)(2) would be weightless. The Attorney General's certification would not \"conclusively establish scope of office or employment\" for either trial or removal. Instead, the Attorney General's scope certification would supply only a tentative basis for removal, rather than a conclusive one. In <i>Lamagno,</i> the Court unanimously agreed that Congress spoke unambiguously on this matter: Congress adopted the \"conclusiv[e] . . . for purposes of removal\" language to \"foreclose needless shuttling of a case from one court to another.\" 515 U.S., at 433, n. 10, 115 S.Ct. 2227; see <i>id.,</i> at 440, 115 S.Ct. 2227 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (\"[T]here is nothing equivocal about [\u00a7 2679(d)(2)'s] provision that once a state tort action has been removed to a federal court after a certification by the Attorney General, it may never be remanded to the state system.\").</p>\n<p>With the Westfall Act's provisions on removal of actions filed in state court in clear view, we return to the question whether an order remanding a case removed pursuant to \u00a7 2679(d)(2) is reviewable. <i>Thermtron</i> held that \u00a7 1447(d) must be read together with \u00a7 1447(c). There is stronger cause, we conclude, to hold that \u00a7 1447(c) and (d) must be read together with the later enacted \u00a7 2679(d)(2). Both \u00a7 1447(d) and \u00a7 2679(d)(2) are antishuttling provisions. Each aims to prevent \"prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.\" <i>United States v. Rice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104276\"><a href=\"/opinion/104276/united-states-v-rice/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 751, 66 S.Ct. 835, 90 L.Ed. 982 (1946). Section 2679(d)(2) is operative when the Attorney General certifies scope of employment, triggering removal of the case to a federal forum. At that point, \u00a7 2679(d)(2) renders the federal court exclusively competent and categorically precludes a remand to the state court.</p>\n<p>The command that the Attorney General's certification \"shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal,\" \u00a7 2679(d)(2), differentiates certified Westfall Act cases from the typical case remanded for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. Ordinarily, when the plaintiff moves to remand a removed case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, the federal district court undertakes a threshold inquiry; typically the court determines whether complete diversity exists or whether the complaint raises a federal question. In Attorney General certified Westfall Act cases, however, no threshold determination is called for; the Attorney General's certificate forecloses any jurisdictional inquiry. By declaring the Attorney General's certification \"conclusive\" as to the federal forum's jurisdiction, Congress has barred a district court from passing the case back to the state court where it originated based on the court's disagreement with the Attorney General's scope-of-employment determination.</p>\n<p>Our decision that \u00a7 2679(d)(2) leaves the district court without authority to send a certified case back to the state court scarcely means that whenever the district court misconstrues a jurisdictional statute, appellate review of the remand is in order. Such an exception would, of course, collide <span class=\"star-pagination\">*896</span> head on with \u00a7 1447(d), and with our precedent. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117984\"><a href=\"/opinion/117984/things-remembered-inc-v-petrarca/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 127-128, 116 S.Ct. 494, 133 L.Ed.2d 461 (1995). Only in the extraordinary case in which Congress has ordered the intercourt shuttle to travel just one way\u0097from state to federal court\u0097does today's decision hold sway.</p>\n<p>In short, of the two antishuttling commands, \u00a7 1447(d) and \u00a7 2679(d)(2), only one can prevail. We hold that \u00a7 2679(d)(2) controls. Tailor-made for Westfall Act cases, \u00a7 2679(d)(2) is a forum-selecting rule Congress made \"conclusive,\" beyond the ken of district courts to revise. See <i>Thermtron,</i> 423 U.S., at 351, 96 S.Ct. 584.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In <i>Lamagno,</i> the Court considered, but did not definitively resolve, the question whether Article III permits \"[t]reating the Attorney General's certification as conclusive for purposes of removal but not for purposes of substitution.\" 515 U.S., at 434, 115 S.Ct. 2227. It was argued in that case that if certification is rejected and substitution denied \"because the federal court concludes that the employee acted outside the scope of his employment, and if the tort plaintiff and the [defendant-employee] are not of diverse citizenship, . . . then the federal court will be left with a case without a federal question to support the court's subject-matter jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 434-435, 115 S.Ct. 2227. <i>Lamagno</i> was an action commenced in federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship, so there was in that case \"not even the specter of an Article III problem.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 435, 115 S.Ct. 2227.</p>\n<p>In the case before us, the question would arise only if, after full consideration, the District Court determines that Haley in fact engaged in the tortious conduct outside the scope of his employment charged in Osborn's complaint. At that point, however, little would be left to adjudicate, at least as to Haley's liability. Because a significant federal question (whether Haley has Westfall Act immunity) would have been raised at the outset, the case would \"aris[e] under\" federal law, as that term is used in Article III. See <i>Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110932\"><a href=\"/opinion/110932/verlinden-bv-v-central-bank-of-nigeria/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 493, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983). Even if only state-law claims remained after resolution of the federal question, the District Court would have discretion, consistent with Article III, to retain jurisdiction. See <i>Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111983\"><a href=\"/opinion/111983/carnegie-mellon-univ-v-cohill/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span>, 350-351, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988) (when federal character of removed case is eliminated while the case is <i>sub judice,</i> court has discretion to retain jurisdiction, to remand, or to dismiss); cf. <i>Mine Workers v. Gibbs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107200\"><a href=\"/opinion/107200/mine-workers-v-gibbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966) (pendent jurisdiction may be exercised when federal and state claims have a \"common nucleus of operative fact\" and would \"ordinarily be expected to [be tried] all in one judicial proceeding\"). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 (\"Supplemental jurisdiction\"). \"[C]onsiderations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants,\" <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U.S., at 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, make it reasonable and proper for a federal court to proceed to final judgment, once it has invested time and resources to resolve the pivotal scope-of-employment contest. Thus, under the precedent that guides us, the Westfall Act's command that a district court retain jurisdiction over a case removed pursuant to \u00a7 2679(d)(2) does not run afoul of Article III.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>With the jurisdictional issues resolved, we reach the principal question raised by petitioner Osborn: whether the United States Attorney validly certified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*897</span> that Haley \"was acting within the scope of his employment . . . at the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint.\" Luber App. 23. We note first that the certificate is formally in order; it closely tracks the language of the Westfall Act. See \u00a7 2679(d)(2) (authorizing certification \"that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose\"). In <i>Lamagno,</i> we held that the Attorney General's certification is \"the first, but not the final word\" on whether the federal officer is immune from suit and, correlatively, whether the United States is properly substituted as defendant. 515 U.S., at 432, 115 S.Ct. 2227. A plaintiff may request judicial review of the Attorney General's scope-of-employment determination, as Osborn did here.</p>\n<p>As earlier recounted, see <i>supra,</i> at 890, the District Court initially accepted Osborn's allegations as true because it believed that the United States did not dispute them. Applying Kentucky law, that court determined that \"Haley's alleged actions occurred outside the scope of his employment.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a. In a motion for reconsideration, the Government clarified that, far from admitting Osborn's allegations, it disputed the very occurrence of the harm-causing conduct Osborn alleged. In support of the motion, the Government submitted affidavits from Haley and Luber denying that they engaged in the conduct ascribed to them in Osborn's complaint. The Government contended that Haley remained within the proper bounds of his employment at the relevant time and place because the wrongdoing Osborn alleged never happened.</p>\n<p>The Government's reconsideration motion asked the District Court to resolve the factual dispute, <i>i.e.,</i> to determine whether, as the complaint alleged, Haley prevailed upon Luber to discharge Osborn, or whether, as Haley asserted, he never communicated with Luber about Osborn's LBLA employment. The court did not grant the Government's request for resolution of the factual dispute. Instead, it held the Westfall Act certification invalid precisely because the Government denied that Haley engaged in harm-causing conduct.</p>\n<p>Two Courts of Appeals have held that Westfall Act certification is improper when the Government denies the occurrence of the alleged injury-causing action or episode. See <i>Wood,</i> 995 F.2d, at 1123 (C.A.1); <i>McHugh,</i> 966 F.2d, at 74-75 (C.A.2). The Sixth Circuit, in this case, and several other Courts of Appeals have held that a plaintiff's allegation of conduct beyond the scope of a federal official's employment does not block certification where the Government contends that the alleged tortious conduct did not occur. See <i>Heuton,</i> 75 F.3d, at 360 (C.A.8); <i>Kimbro,</i> 30 F.3d, at 1508 (C.A.D.C.); <i>Melo,</i> 13 F.3d, at 746-747 (C.A.3). We agree that Westfall Act certification is proper when a federal officer charged with misconduct asserts, and the Government determines, that the incident or episode in suit never occurred.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Westfall Act grants a federal employee suit immunity, we reiterate, when \"acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.\" \u00a7 2679(d)(1), (2). That formulation, we are persuaded, encompasses an employee on duty at the time and place of an \"incident\" alleged in a complaint who denies that the incident occurred. See <i>Wood,</i> 995 F.2d, at 1134 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting) (\"[S]urely the statute applies with the same force whether a postal service driver says that he did not hit the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*898</span> plaintiff's car or that he did so but was not at fault.\"); <i>Melo,</i> 13 F.3d, at 747. And just as the Government's certification that an employee \"was acting within the scope of his employment\" is subject to threshold judicial review, <i>Lamagno,</i> 515 U.S., at 434, 115 S.Ct. 2227, so a complaint's charge of conduct outside the scope of employment, when contested, warrants immediate judicial investigation. Were it otherwise, a federal employee would be stripped of suit immunity not by what the court finds, but by what the complaint alleges.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, given the purpose of the Westfall Act to shield covered employees not only from liability but from suit, it is altogether appropriate to afford protection to a \"negligent . . . employee . . . as a matter of course.\" <i>Wood,</i> 995 F.2d, at 1135 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting). But it would make scant sense to read the Act as leaving an employee charged with an intentional tort<sup>[11]</sup> to fend for himself when he denies wrongdoing and asserts he \"engaged only in proper behavior occurring wholly within the scope of his office or employment.\" <i>Ibid.</i> See also <i>Heuton,</i> 75 F.3d, at 360 (\"[I]t is illogical to assume that Congress intended to protect guilty employees but desert innocent ones.\").<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Willingham v.

The defendants removed pursuant to \u00a7 1442(a)(1), and the District Court upheld their defense of official immunity. The Tenth Circuit reversed, reading <span class=\"star-pagination\">*899</span> \u00a7 1442(a)(1) to permit removal only when a defendant \"exclude[s] the possibility that the suit is based on acts or conduct not justified by his federal duty.\" <i>Morgan v. Willingham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"277235\"><a href=\"/opinion/277235/deniel-morgan-v-john-t-willingham-and-c-a-jarvis/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 141 (1967). We rejected that narrow construction of the statute and held \u00a7 1442 \"broad enough to cover all cases where federal officers can raise a colorable defense arising out of the duty to enforce federal law.\" 395 U.S., at 406-407, 89 S.Ct. 1813.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff in <i>Willingham</i> disputed that the defendant federal officials had acted under color of office. He alleged that they \"had been acting on a frolic of their own which had no relevancy to their official duties as employees or officers of the United States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 407, 89 S.Ct. 1813 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held that the officers \"should have the opportunity to <i>present their version of the facts</i> to a federal, not a state, court.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 409, 89 S.Ct. 1813 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>We see no reason to conclude that the Attorney General's ability to remove a suit to federal court under \u00a7 2679(d)(2), unlike a federal officer's ability to remove under \u00a7 1442, should be controlled by the plaintiff's allegations. In <i>Willingham,</i> the federal officer's \"relationship to [the plaintiff] derived solely from their official duties.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Similarly here, Haley interacted with Osborn and Luber only through his employment as a Forest Service officer.<sup>[14]</sup> For purposes of removal under \u00a7 1442(a), the defendants in <i>Willingham</i> were not required to accept the truth of the plaintiff's allegations that they were \"on a frolic of their own,\" <i>id.,</i> at 407, 89 S.Ct. 1813 (internal quotation marks omitted), and had tortured plaintiff \"out of malice,\" 383 F.2d, at 140 (internal quotation marks omitted). So here, for purposes of removal under \u00a7 2679(d)(2), Haley and the Government were not required to accept as true Osborn's allegations that Haley \"maliciously induced\" her dismissal from LBLA \"in retaliation for plaintiff filing a veterans' preference inquiry.\" Complaint \u00b6 29, Luber App. 7. Haley, like the defendant in <i>Willingham,</i> may have been on frolic of his own as Osborn alleged, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*900</span> therefore may not be entitled to immunity. But like the officers in <i>Willingham,</i> he should have the opportunity to \"present [his] version of the facts to a federal . . . court.\" 395 U.S., at 409, 89 S.Ct. 1813.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Tugging against our reading of the Westfall Act, we recognize, is a \"who decides\" concern. If the Westfall Act certification must be respected unless and until the District Court determines that Haley, <i>in fact,</i> engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment, then Osborn may be denied a jury trial. Compare <i>Wood,</i> 995 F.2d, at 1126, 1130, with <i>id.,</i> at 1134-1138 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting). Should the District Court find that Haley did not maliciously induce Luber to discharge Osborn, but instead interacted with Luber and Osborn only within the proper bounds of his employment, Osborn will lose on the merits with no access to a jury of her peers.<sup>[15]</sup> \"This is not a small objection,\" for the issue \"that goes to the heart of the merits, as well as to the validity of the certificate,\" will likely turn on the credibility of Osborn, Haley, and Luber, and credibility \"may be well suited for jury resolution.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 1136-1137.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>Under the Westfall Act, however, Congress supplanted the jury in covered cases. See \u00a7 2679(d)(1)-(3). Upon certification, the action is \"deemed to be. . . brought against the United States,\" <i>ibid.,</i> unless and until the district court determines that the federal officer originally named as defendant was acting outside the scope of his employment. The Seventh Amendment, which preserves the right to a jury trial in suits at common law, we have held, does not apply to proceedings against the sovereign. <i>Lehman v. Nakshian,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110550\"><a href=\"/opinion/110550/lehman-v-nakshian/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, 101 S.Ct. 2698, 69 L.Ed.2d 548 (1981). See also \u00a7 2402 (actions against the United States ordinarily \"shall be tried by the court without a jury\"). Thus, at the time the district court reviews the Attorney General's certification, the plaintiff has no right to a jury trial. See <i>Kimbro,</i> 30 F.3d, at 1509, n. 4.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>The Westfall Act's core purpose also bears on the appropriate trier of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*901</span> any facts essential to certification. That purpose is to relieve covered employees from the cost and effort of defending the lawsuit, and to place those burdens on the Government's shoulders. See <i>supra,</i> at 892-893. Immunity-related issues, the Court has several times instructed, should be decided at the earliest opportunity. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Hunter v. Bryant,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112671\"><a href=\"/opinion/112671/hunter-v-bryant/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 228, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991) <i>(per curiam)</i> (\"Immunity ordinarily should be decided by the court long before trial.\"); <i>Anderson v.

Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) provides, with one exception not relevant here, that \"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\" In sanctioning appellate review notwithstanding \u00a7 1447(d), the Court relies on its determination that Congress, through \u00a7 2679(d)(2), has prohibited remand in cases like this one, in order to give effect to the conclusive character of the Attorney General's certification on the issue of removal jurisdiction. But as we recently held, \"`review is unavailable no matter how plain the legal error in ordering the remand.'\" <i>Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust,</i> 547 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 2145, 2154, 165 L.Ed.2d 92 (2006) (quoting <i>Briscoe v. Bell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109706\"><a href=\"/opinion/109706/briscoe-v-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span>, 414, n. 13, 97 S.Ct. 2428, 53 L.Ed.2d 439 (1977)). Thus, rather than allowing \u00a7 2679(d)(2) to trump \u00a7 1447(d), I would reaffirm the rule that a district court's remand order is unreviewable even if it is based on an erroneous understanding of the district court's jurisdiction.<sup>[1]</sup> But I would not otherwise limit the Attorney General's (or the employee's) efforts to give the intended effect to the certification <span class=\"star-pagination\">*902</span> prior to any remand that might be ordered.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court, therefore, that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review the District Court's order resubstituting Haley as defendant. That order was not \"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed,\" so by its own terms \u00a7 1447(d) does not apply to review of that decision. Allowing review of a resubstitution order makes good on the promise of the Westfall Act: by permitting disaggregation of a remand order from a substantive determination about substitution that preceded it (in the manner exemplified by <i>Waco v.

Incidentally, of course, my reading of the statutes can give an appellate court the opportunity to correct a district court's erroneous understanding of the legitimacy of removal before any remand is effected, making it very unlikely that a mistakenly premised remand order will be carried out. If a district court resisted edification, however, the remand order would be conclusive against appeal, in accord with \u00a7 1447(d). See <i>Kircher, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2154.</p>\n<p>In sum, my resolution of this case is a pair of half-loaves. The policy of avoiding litigation over remands is tempered by allowing appeals on the important matter of substitution. The policy behind making the Attorney General's certification conclusive is qualified by insulating a remand order from review, no matter how erroneous its jurisdictional premise. Neither policy has it all, but each gets something.</p>\n<p>I would remand this case to the Court of Appeals for proceedings consistent with this understanding.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court's jurisdictional analysis and its disposition of the District Court's remand order and so join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion. But I dissent from Part III. I continue to believe that the Westfall Act permits the Attorney General to certify only when accepting, at least conditionally, the existence of some kind of \"incident.\" But where the incident, if it took place at all, <i>must have</i> fallen outside the scope of employment, the Act does not permit certification. See <i>Wood v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609175\"><a href=\"/opinion/609175/theresa-h-wood-v-united-states-of-america-charles-/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></a></span> (C.A.1 1993) (en banc).</p>\n<p>Here, the Attorney General did claim, in the alternative, that <i>if</i> an incident took place (<i>i.e.,</i> if the federal employee Haley spoke to Osborn's employer with respect to Osborn's employment), any such incident would have fallen within the scope of Haley's employment. But, for procedural reasons, that alternative claim is not before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*903</span> us. <i>Ante,</i> at 891, n. 6. Hence I must consider this case as if it were quite a different kind of case, one in which what took place was either an incident <i>outside the scope of employment</i> or no incident at all. Consider, for example, an aggravated sexual assault, a theft of personal property, or an auto accident on Coney Island where the Government employee, say a Yellowstone Park forest ranger, if present on Coney Island must have been there on a frolic of his own. The majority's approach finds Westfall Act immunity in cases of this kind. I would not.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the Act's language suggests that it does not apply in such circumstances. The statute says that the Attorney General must certify that the employee \"was acting within the scope of his office or employment <i>at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.</i>\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2) (emphasis added). The italicized words, read naturally, assume some kind of incident, the <i>characterization</i> of which (<i>e.g.,</i> as within the scope of employment) determines whether immunity attaches. By way of contrast, permitting purely incident-denying certifications, as the majority does, can only be squared with the Act's text if the Attorney General is required to supply the reviewing court with proof of what the employee <i>was</i> doing (and that such activities <i>were</i> within the scope of employment) \"at the time of the incident\"\u0097a showing that would prove quite difficult in a case such as this, where the plaintiff has alleged that the tort was committed at some unknown time over a period of days, or weeks, or even longer.</p>\n<p>For another, there is nothing to suggest the Westfall Act sought to provide immunity for tort claims necessarily falling outside the scope of federal employment. As its popular name suggests, the Act focused upon <i>Westfall v. Erwin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111980\"><a href=\"/opinion/111980/westfall-v-erwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 108 S.Ct. 580, 98 L.Ed.2d 619 (1988), an earlier case in which the Court considered whether, to obtain immunity from state-law tort suits, a federal official had to show not just that his conduct was \"within the scope of [his] employment,\" but also that it was <i>\"discretionary in nature.\" Id.,</i> at 295, 108 S.Ct. 580 (emphasis added). The Court answered \"yes.\" It held that a federal employee was <i>not</i> immune from a state-law tort suit, even for simple negligence, unless the employee could also show that his conduct was discretionary.</p>\n<p>The Westfall Act basically seeks to overturn this holding. As this Court has said, \"[w]hen Congress wrote the Westfall Act. . ., the legislators had one purpose firmly in mind [namely] to override <i>Westfall v. </i><i>Erwin.</i>\" <i>Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117955\"><a href=\"/opinion/117955/gutierrez-de-martinez-v-lamagno/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 425, 115 S.Ct. 2227, 132 L.Ed.2d 375 (1995). The House Judiciary Committee wrote that the Act's \"functional effect . . . is to return Federal employees to the status they held prior to the <i>Westfall</i> decision.\" H.R.Rep. No. 100-700, p. 4 (1988), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 1988, pp. 5945, 5947. And that \"status,\" many thought, was an immunity that applied to nondiscretionary, as well as discretionary, actions that fell \"within the scope\" of the employee's \"office or employment.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(1); H.R.Rep. No. 100-700, at 4.</p>\n<p>In a word, the Act seeks to <i>maintain</i> the scope of pre-<i>Westfall</i> immunity <i>minus Westfall'</i>s <i>\"discretionary function\" limitation.</i> That purpose does not encompass an extension of immunity to all-or-nothing conduct, <i>i.e.,</i> those serious assaults or personal \"frolics\" that, <i>if they took place at all,</i> could not possibly have fallen within the scope of the employee's \"office or employment.\"</p>\n<p>Further, to try to bring the latter type of conduct within the scope of the Act's immunity creates a series of anomalies. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*904</span> As the Court recognizes, its interpretation may limit the plaintiff's ability to obtain jury consideration of factual matters critical to his or her case. Indeed, <i>any</i> Government employee defendant, including a defendant whom the Attorney General does <i>not</i> want to defend, can ask the judge to issue a certificate. \u00a7 2679(d)(3). On the Court's view of the statute, the issuance of the certificate could depend upon whether, for example, the aggravated sexual assault took place at all or whether the defendant was at Yellowstone or Coney Island at the relevant times. And, in deciding these questions (as the judge would have to do to determine whether the certificate should issue), the judge, not the jury, would decide the main issue in the case. (The Court declines to address the effect of its analysis on \u00a7 2679(d)(3). <i>Ante,</i> at 900, n. 17. But the relevant language in this provision is virtually identical to the language at issue in this case, see \u00a7 2679(d)(2), so one cannot seriously suggest that the Act by its own terms affords employees any narrower a basis for seeking certification than it affords the Attorney General.)</p>\n<p>It is highly unusual to permit special, speedy judge factfinding where immunity is at issue. Ordinarily, when a party asserts an immunity defense, <i>i.e.,</i> an \"entitlement not to stand trial <i>under certain circumstances,</i>\" <i>Mitchell v. Forsyth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 525, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (emphasis added), special immunity-related procedures focus, not upon factfinding, but upon the proper <i>legal characterization</i> of the facts as given. Where the parties' immunity-related disagreement amounts to a dispute about the <i>law,</i> namely whether the particular set of facts alleged by the plaintiff does, or does not, fall within the immunity's legal scope, the defendant is entitled to a quick determination of the legal question by the trial judge and, if necessary, an immediate interlocutory appeal. <i>Id.,</i> at 526, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806. See <i>Nixon v. Fitzgerald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110762\"><a href=\"/opinion/110762/nixon-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 742-743, 102 S.Ct. 2690, 73 L.Ed.2d 349 (1982); see also <i>Helstoski v. Meanor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110108\"><a href=\"/opinion/110108/helstoski-v-meanor/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span>, 507-508, 99 S.Ct. 2445, 61 L.Ed.2d 30 (1979). But where that disagreement amounts to a dispute about the <i>facts,</i> immunity law does <i>not</i> ordinarily entitle the defendant to special procedural treatment. Rather, the defendant must take the <i>facts</i> as the plaintiff asserts them. Like any other defendant, he can move for summary judgment. <i>Mitchell, supra,</i> at 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806; <i>Anderson v. Creighton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 646-647, n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). But if the plaintiff provides sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment, the defendant must win the case at trial.</p>\n<p>Thus ordinarily an immunity defense provides special procedural treatment only for a defendant's legal claim that the facts <i>taken as the plaintiff asserts them</i> (or <i>taken as the assertions have survived a motion for summary judgment</i>) fall within the scope of the immunity. It does not provide special treatment for disputes about the facts. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 319-320, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995) (defendant raising immunity defense \"may not appeal a district court's summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a `genuine' issue of fact for trial\"). The Court's reading of the Westfall Act works a major change in this fact/law relationship. Under the Court's reading, the defendant will have the right to ask the judge to determine the facts, <i>i.e.,</i> to determine whether the events plaintiff says occurred did in fact happen. And that is so <i>even where the plaintiff has enough evidence to bring the case to the jury.</i></p>\n<p>The Court's reading of the Act proves even more anomalous in the case of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*905</span> federal employee claiming an assault that violates both (a) state tort law and (b) federal civil rights law. Suppose that the defendant's sole defense is \"mistaken identity.\" The defendant argues that nothing took place between him and the plaintiff, that at the relevant time he was working peacefully at his desk. Under the Court's reading, the defendant is entitled to have the <i>judge</i> decide the factual question; and, should the judge decide in his favor (in respect to the state-law tort claim), collateral estoppel likely means an end of the matter in respect to the federal civil rights claim, as well. Yet the Westfall Act explicitly <i>exempts</i> from its scope any claim of \"violation of a federal statute\" or the Federal Constitution. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(2).</p>\n<p>The Court rests much of its analysis on <i>Willingham v. Morgan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107963\"><a href=\"/opinion/107963/willingham-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 89 S.Ct. 1813, 23 L.Ed.2d 396 (1969), but I do not think that case offers much support. <i>Willingham</i> addressed <i>only</i> a federal officer's right to remove a case to federal court (via \u00a7 1442(a)(1)). <i>Id.,</i> at 403, 89 S.Ct. 1813. Once there, the officer could pursue traditional immunity defenses, <i>i.e.,</i> based on the facts as alleged by the plaintiff or as they survived summary judgment; that is all the Court could have meant when it said that officers \"should have the opportunity to present their version of the facts to a federal, not a state, court,\" <i>id.,</i> at 409, 89 S.Ct. 1813. Moreover, in <i>Mesa v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112198\"><a href=\"/opinion/112198/mesa-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 139, 109 S.Ct. 959, 103 L.Ed.2d 99 (1989), this Court held that \"[f]ederal officer removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a) must be predicated upon averment of a federal defense.\" Because the federal employee defendants in <i>Mesa</i> \"ha[d] not and could not present an official immunity defense\" to the charges against them, removal was improper under \u00a7 1442(a)(1). <i>Id.,</i> at 133, 109 S.Ct. 959. The majority reads the Westfall Act much more broadly than this Court read \u00a7 1442(a) in <i>Mesa,</i> permitting removal in cases where there is unquestionably no official immunity defense available (at least as such defenses have been understood by this Court until today). And in so doing, the majority opens wide the door not just to removal, which was all that was at issue in <i>Willingham</i> and <i>Mesa,</i> but, much more consequentially, to substituting a judge's factfinding for a plaintiff's jury trial right.</p>\n<p>I do not claim that my own reading of the Westfall Act will totally eliminate the difficulties I have mentioned. But an interpretation that reads the Act's language more literally will minimize them, while also largely mitigating the problem of clever pleading with which the majority is rightly concerned, <i>ante,</i> at 898. The Act says the \"Attorney General\" must certify that the \"employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment <i>at the time of the incident</i> out of which the claim arose.\" \u00a7 2679(d)(2) (emphasis added). As I have said, that language prevents the Attorney General from denying that any \"incident\" at all occurred without at least adding in the alternative that any incident the plaintiff might be able to show falls within the employee's scope of employment regardless.</p>\n<p>Thus, if a plaintiff claims an <i>intentional</i> touching (outside the scope of employment), the Attorney General is free to claim (a) there was no touching but (b) were the evidence to show a touching, it was accidental (within the scope of employment). Yet if the plaintiff accuses the employee, a Yellowstone Park ranger, of negligent driving on Coney Island, the Attorney General could not make a similar claim. (Nor could he likely do so in respect to an employee whom the plaintiff claims committed a serious sexual assault.) That is because if these latter incidents did happen, they must have fallen outside the scope of employment, while if they did not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*906</span> happen, then <i>nothing</i> involving the employee happened at all. In such cases no Westfall Act immunity would be available. And that is just as it should be.</p>\n<p>This approach resembles, but differs in important respects from that of the First Circuit in <i>Wood.</i> In <i>Wood,</i> the First Circuit held that a judge reviewing a Westfall Act certificate could resolve factual conflicts as to \"incident-describing and incident-characterizing facts,\" but must leave for the jury (if it came to that) disputes over whether any incident occurred at all. 995 F.2d, at 1129. Here, I offer a compromise between <i>Wood</i> and the majority's more extreme approach. I would permit a judge reviewing a Westfall Act certificate to resolve <i>any</i> factual disputes relevant to whether the defendant was \"acting within the scope of his office or employment,\" including, when necessary, determining whether the incident occurred at all. But I would only permit the judge to fulfill this factfinding function in those cases where the Attorney General (or the defendant employee, under \u00a7 2679(d)(3)) can offer <i>some</i> plausible explanation of the alleged incident that would bring the defendant's actions within the scope of his federal office or employment.</p>\n<p>The majority's approach, absent some undefined constraint that might be imposed in future cases, <i>ante,</i> at 899, n. 14, would permit factfinding by a judge (and, where the Attorney General requests, removal to federal court) in <i>any</i> state-law tort case involving a federal employee. I would permit judges to fulfill this rather extraordinary factfinding function only in those cases where the \"injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death\" for which the plaintiff seeks recovery <i>might</i> have \"aris[en] or result[ed] from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of [the federal employee] while acting within the scope of his office or employment\"\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> where there is <i>some chance</i> the injury (if any) was caused by the kinds of actions for which the Act expressly grants employees immunity, under \u00a7 2679(b)(1). This approach protects the innocent employee as well as the guilty, <i>ante,</i> at 898, but only in the class of law suits the Act can plausibly be read to cover.</p>\n<p>Because the Court of Appeals interpreted the Act as does the Court, I would vacate its judgment. I would, however, permit the Court of Appeals to consider the Government's alternative assertion of immunity (including whether it was properly barred by the trial court), and to determine whether Westfall Act immunity applies on that basis.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I dissent from Part III of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Few statutes read more clearly than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d): \"An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise . . . .\"<sup>[1]</sup> That bar to appellate review is a venerable one, dating back to 1887, see <i>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109348\"><a href=\"/opinion/109348/thermtron-products-inc-v-hermansdorfer/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 343, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976).

Yet beginning in 1976, this Court has repeatedly eroded \u00a7 1447(d)'s mandate and expanded the Court's jurisdiction. Today's opinion eviscerates <span class=\"star-pagination\">*907</span> what little remained of Congress's Court-limiting command.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The first narrowing of \u00a7 1447(d) occurred in <i>Thermtron Products,</i> over the dissent of Justice Rehnquist joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Stewart (only eight Justices sat in the case). <i>Thermtron Products</i> held that remand orders <i>are</i> reviewable if they are based on any grounds <i>other</i> than the mandatory ground for remand set forth in \u00a7 1447(c)\u0097 namely, that \"`the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.'\"<sup>[2]</sup> 423 U.S., at 342, 96 S.Ct. 584. That result followed, the Court said, because subsections (c) and (d) are <i>\"in pari materia\"</i> and \"must be construed together.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 345, 96 S.Ct. 584. Thus, the unlimited phrase \"[a]n order remanding a case\" magically became \"an order remanding a case under this section\"\u0097changing prior law, under which the Court had held that the predecessors of \u00a7 1447(d) prohibited review of all remand orders. See <i>id.,</i> at 354-356, 96 S.Ct. 584 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Since, in <i>Thermtron Products,</i> the District Court had remanded solely because of its crowded docket, we accepted review and issued a writ of mandamus compelling reconsideration of the order. See also <i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins.

Putnam Funds Trust,</i> 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2145, 165 L.Ed.2d 92 (2006). There, as here, the District Court had remanded to state court \"on the ground that [it] lacked subject matter jurisdiction on removal.\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2148. That should have been the end of the matter, but it was not. The <i>Kircher</i> majority embarked on a searching inquiry into whether the District Court's <i>real reason</i> for remand was lack of jurisdiction. See <i>id.,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2154-2158. In my concurrence, I warned that \"[r]eview of the sort engaged in . . . threatens to defeat the purpose of \u00a7 1447(d),\" which was \"`to prevent delay in the trial of remanded cases by protracted litigation of jurisdictional issues.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___-___, 126 S.Ct., at 2148 (quoting <i>Thermtron Products, supra,</i> at 351, 96 S.Ct. 584).</p>\n<blockquote>\"Such delay can be created just as easily by asking whether the district court correctly characterized the basis for its order as it can by asking whether that basis was correct . . . . Whether the District Court was right or wrong\u0097even if it was so badly mistaken that it misunderstood the true basis for its orders\u0097it <i>purported</i> to remand for lack of jurisdiction, and \u00a7 1447(d) bars any further review.\" <i>Kircher,</i> 547 U.S., at ___- ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2148.</blockquote>\n<p>Today's opinion goes even further than <i>Kircher.</i> Whereas that case at least <i>claimed</i> to be applying our precedents, see, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at ___-___, 126 S.Ct., at 2154-2155 (citing <i>Briscoe v. Bell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109706\"><a href=\"/opinion/109706/briscoe-v-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span>, 413-414, n. 13, 97 S.Ct. 2428, 53 L.Ed.2d 439 (1977)), today's opinion makes no such pretense. Having recognized, as it must, that the District Court in this case <span class=\"star-pagination\">*908</span> invoked \u00a7 1447(c) and remanded for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, <i>ante,</i> at 896, the Court nevertheless reaches the amazing conclusion that \u00a7 1447(d) does not \"contro[l]\" whether the remand order is reviewable on appeal. <i>Ante,</i> at 895-896.</p>\n<p>How can that be? How can a statute explicitly eliminating appellate jurisdiction to review a remand order not \"contro[l]\" whether an appellate court has jurisdiction to review a remand order? The Court says the answer to this riddle lies in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2). But that section says only that the Attorney General's certification is \"conclusiv[e] . . . for purposes of <i>removal</i>\" (emphasis added); it says absolutely nothing about the reviewability of remand orders. Thus, the most \u00a7 2679(d)(2) can prove is that the District Court should not have remanded the case; that its remand order was erroneous. But our precedents make abundantly clear that \u00a7 1447(d)'s appellate-review bar applies with full force to erroneous remand orders. Just last Term we acknowledged that \"a remand premised on an erroneous conclusion of no jurisdiction is unappealable.\" <i>Kircher, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct., at 2155. See also <i>Thermtron Products, supra,</i> at 343, 96 S.Ct. 584 (\"If a trial judge <i>purports</i> to remand a case on the ground that it was removed `improvidently and without jurisdiction,' his order is not subject to challenge in the court of appeals by appeal, by mandamus, or otherwise\") (quoting \u00a7 1447(c) (1975 ed.) (emphasis added)); <i>Briscoe, supra,</i> at 414, n. 13, 97 S.Ct. 2428 (where a remand order is based on one of the grounds enumerated in \u00a7 1447(c), \"review is unavailable no matter how plain the legal error in ordering the remand\"). Today's opinion repudiates that principle. The <i>only</i> basis for its holding is that \u00a7 2679(d)(2) renders the remand erroneous. This utterly novel proposition, that a remand order can be set aside when it is contrary to law, leaves nothing remaining of \u00a7 1447(d). Determination of an order's lawfulness can only be made upon review\u0097and it is precisely review that \u00a7 1447(d) forbids.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Congress knows how to make remand orders reviewable when it wishes to do so. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441a(<i>l</i>)(3)(C) (\"The Corporation may appeal any order of remand entered by a United States district court\"); \u00a7 1819(b)(2)(C) (same); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 487(d) (\"[T]he United States shall have the right to appeal from any order of remand in the case\"). Even \u00a7 1447(d) itself exempts certain remand orders from its own appellate-review bar. See n. 1, <i>supra.</i> \"Absent a clear statutory command to the contrary, we assume that Congress is aware of the universality of th[e] practice of denying appellate review of remand orders when Congress creates a new ground for removal.\" <i>Things Remembered,</i> 516 U.S., at 128, 116 S.Ct. 494 (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Court recognized in <i>Kircher,</i> \"[t]here is no such `clear statutory command' here, and that silence tells us we must look to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) to determine the reviewability of remand orders under the Act.\" 547 U.S., at ___, n. 8, 126 S.Ct., at 2154, n. 8. Were the Court in this case to look to \u00a7 1447(d), instead of looking for a way around \u00a7 1447(d), the answer would be abundantly clear.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Respondents argued that, even if the remand order is unreviewable on appeal, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*909</span> the District Court's rejection of the Attorney General's certification should be reviewable as a logically distinct determination, citing <i>Waco v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102318\"><a href=\"/opinion/102318/waco-v-united-states-fidelity-guaranty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934). See <i>ante,</i> at 901-902 (SOUTER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (adopting this argument).</p>\n<p>The continuing vitality of <i>Waco</i> is dubious in light of more recent precedents, see <i>Kircher, supra,</i> at ___, n. 13, 126 S.Ct., at 2156, n. 13. We need not address that question here, however, since <i>Waco</i> is patently inapposite. There, removal had been premised on diversity jurisdiction. The District Court dismissed the party whose citizenship was alleged to supply the requisite diversity, finding that party's joinder improper, and thus remanded the case for lack of jurisdiction. We found the dismissal order to be reviewable on appeal, even though the remand order was not. 293 U.S., at 143, 55 S.Ct. 6. But there is a crucial distinction between that case and this one: In <i>Waco,</i> reversal of the dismissal would not have subverted the remand. There was <i>no question</i> that the suit would proceed in state court regardless of whether the diverse party was rightfully or wrongfully dismissed. Nowhere did the <i>Waco</i> Court so much as hint that the District Court might need to reexamine its remand order; to the contrary, it was clear that the remand would occur, no matter what: \"If the District Court's [dismissal] order stands, the cross-action will be no part of the case which is remanded to the state court . . . . <i>A reversal cannot affect the order of remand,</i> but it will at least, if the dismissal of the petitioner's complaint was erroneous, remit the entire controversy, with the [diverse party] still a party, to the state court for such further proceedings.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 143-144, 55 S.Ct. 6 (emphasis added). In other words, the remand order and the dismissal order were truly \"separate orders,\" <i>id.,</i> at 142, 55 S.Ct. 6; we could review\u0097even reverse\u0097the dismissal order without affecting the remand or its impact on the case.</p>\n<p>Today's case far more closely resembles <i>Kircher.</i> There, the remand order had been predicated upon a finding that the cause of action was not a \"covered\" class-action suit as defined by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), 112 Stat. 3227, and therefore that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction. The District Court remanded so the suit could continue in state court, outside the confines of SLUSA. If the suit had been \"covered,\" SLUSA would have precluded the action from going forward in any court, state or federal. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77p(b). We therefore determined that neither the remand itself <i>nor the determination of SLUSA inapplicability</i> was reviewable on appeal: \"The District Court's remand order here cannot be disaggregated as the <i>Waco</i> orders could, and if [we were to find the suit to be covered by SLUSA], there [would be] nothing to remand to state court.\" 547 U.S., at ___, n. 13, 126 S.Ct., at 2156, n. 13. That is precisely the situation in this case: The remand here is predicated upon a finding that the United States should not be substituted as a defendant under the Westfall Act. If we were to disagree with the District Court and substitute the United States as a defendant, while at the same time recognizing (as \u00a7 1447(d) requires) that there is nothing we can do about the remand order, the case would go back to state court as an action under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), see <i>ante,</i> at 888, and the remanded case would be styled <i>Osborn v. United States.</i> But the state court would have to dismiss such a case at once, since federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over FTCA suits. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). Thus, as in <i>Kircher,</i> but unlike <i>Waco,</i> the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*910</span> District Court's decision on the preliminary matter\u0097here, Westfall Act certification; in <i>Kircher,</i> SLUSA applicability\u0097is inextricably intertwined with the remand order. Since that is so, there is no jurisdiction to review either determination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>In an all-too-rare effort to reduce the high cost of litigation, Congress provided that remand orders are completely unreviewable \"on appeal or otherwise.\" Section 1447(d) effectuated a tradeoff of sorts: Even though Congress undoubtedly recognized that some remand orders would be entered in error, it thought that, all in all, justice would better be served by allowing that small minority of cases to proceed in state courts than by subjecting every remanded case to endless rounds of forum disputes. \"[B]y denying any form of review of an order of remand,\" \"Congress. . . established the policy of not permitting interrupting of the litigation of the merits of a removed cause by prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.\" <i>United States v. Rice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104276\"><a href=\"/opinion/104276/united-states-v-rice/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 751, 66 S.Ct. 835, 90 L.Ed. 982 (1946). Today, in its uncompromising pursuit of technical perfection at all costs, this Court has repealed the tradeoff. One might suggest that Congress should restore it, but it is hard to imagine new statutory language accomplishing the desired result any more clearly than \u00a7 1447(d) already does.</p>\n<p>I would vacate the Sixth Circuit's judgment in its entirety, since that court, like this one, plainly lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We draw this account of the facts from the District Court's opinion and order denying reconsideration, supplemented by the allegations in Osborn's complaint.</p>\n<p>[2]  The certification read:\n</p>\n<p>\"I, Monica Wheatley, Acting United States Attorney, Western District of Kentucky, acting pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2), and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Appendix to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.3 (1990), hereby certify that the Office of the United States Attorney has reviewed the available facts in this matter. On the basis of the information now available to me with respect to the allegations in the complaint, I find that the named federal defendant, Barry Haley, was acting within the scope of his employment with the U.S. Forest Service, at the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint.\" Luber App. 23.</p>\n<p>[3]  The federal officer removal statute provides that \"[a] civil action or criminal prosecution commenced in a State court against\" \"any officer ... of the United States ... sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office\" \"may be removed... to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending.\" \u00a7 1442(a), (a)(1), (b).</p>\n<p>[4]  The District Court did not address the propriety of removal under \u00a7 1442. See <i>infra,</i> at ___20, n. 11.</p>\n<p>[5]  Section 1447(c) provides:\n</p>\n<p>\"A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a). If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. An order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal. A certified copy of the order of remand shall be mailed by the clerk to the clerk of the State court. The State court may thereupon proceed with such case.\"</p>\n<p>[6]  The District Court refused to entertain the alternative argument that, if a relevant Haley-Luber conversation did occur, Haley was acting within the scope of his employment. Because Haley had declared, under oath, that he did not communicate with Luber, the court was unwilling to allow discovery on the question whether, if Haley did contact Luber, he was acting within the scope of his employment. But cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(e)(2) (subject to Rule 11 obligations, parties may plead claims or defense \"alternately or hypothetically\"). We express no opinion on the propriety of the District Court's refusal to consider the Government's alternative pleading.</p>\n<p>[7]  Section 1291 provides that \"[t]he courts of appeals . . . shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  At the time <i>Thermtron</i> was decided, \u00a7 1447(c) required a district court to remand a case if it appeared that the case had been \"removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) (1970 ed.). Section 1447(c) now provides that a case must be remanded if \"it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\"</p>\n<p>[9]  As explained by the Third Circuit in <i>Melo v. Hafer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547214\"><a href=\"/opinion/547214/james-c-melo-jr-louise-jurik-donald-ruggerio-karol/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></a></span>, 641 (1990), \"[t]here are significant policy reasons why Congress would choose to give the government an unchallengeable right to have a federal forum for tort suits brought against its employees.\" But Congress' endeavor to secure that right does not mean that Congress also intended to render unreviewable substitution of the United States as defendant in place of the employee. See <i>ibid.;</i> cf. <i>Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117955\"><a href=\"/opinion/117955/gutierrez-de-martinez-v-lamagno/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 430-434, 115 S.Ct. 2227, 132 L.Ed.2d 375 (1995).</p>\n<p>[10]  In an opinion resembling his majority opinion in <i>Wood v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609175\"><a href=\"/opinion/609175/theresa-h-wood-v-united-states-of-america-charles-/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></a></span> (C.A.1 1993) (en banc), Justice BREYER takes the view that the Attorney General may issue a Westfall Act certification if he contests the plaintiff's account of the episode-in-suit, but he must \"assume some kind of incident\" in order to certify. <i>Post,</i> at 903. Thus he would not permit \"purely incident-denying certifications,\" and he places the certification here in that category. <i>Ibid.</i> We agree with the <i>Wood</i> dissenters' appraisal of Justice BREYER's distinction between incident-denying and incident-recharacterizing certifications: That approach would require district courts \"to engage in difficult, time-wasting controversies . . . about precisely <i>which facts</i> pertaining to the scope of employment issue are for the district judge and which are for the jury.\" 995 F.2d, at 1136, and n. 7 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting). Accord <i>Kimbro v. Velten,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675682\"><a href=\"/opinion/675682/marilyn-a-kimbro-v-dolores-velten-department-of-ve/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1501</span></a></span>, 1507 (C.A.D.C.1994) (\"[I]t would be impossible . . . to draw a distinction between a characterization of an incident and whether or not it actually occurred.\").</p>\n<p>[11]  See <i>id.,</i> at 1505 (observing that the question here presented \"tend[s] to arise in cases of alleged intentional torts\").</p>\n<p>[12]  Under Justice BREYER's view, when, in fact, \"<i>nothing</i> involving the employee happened at all . . . no Westfall Act immunity would be available.\" <i>Post,</i> at 905-906. He thinks this \"is just as it should be.\" <i>Post,</i> at 906. We disagree. Congress did not, and sensibly should not, command that innocent employees be left outside the Westfall Act's grant of suit immunity. \"Congress' statute and its policy,\" we agree, \"both look in the opposite direction.\" <i>Wood,</i> 995 F.2d, at 1136 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[13]  The notice of removal in this case invoked \u00a7 1442 as well as \u00a7 2679. In the Sixth Circuit, however, the Government did not urge \u00a7 1442 as a separate ground for reversing the District Court.</p>\n<p>[14]  In the context of \u00a7 1442, we have held that, to qualify for removal, a federal official must show \"a nexus . . . between the charged conduct and asserted official authority.\" <i>Jefferson County v. Acker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118310\"><a href=\"/opinion/118310/jefferson-county-v-acker/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span>, 431, 119 S.Ct. 2069, 144 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We need not today decide whether qualification for Westfall Act immunity is similarly limited, for in this case, a nexus plainly exists connecting the incident Osborn alleged and Haley's federal employment. We note, however, that nothing in our opinion commits the Court to the view that Westfall Act immunity is available in fanciful situations like the one Justice BREYER hypothesizes, <i>post,</i> at 902-903, in which the plaintiff's allegations are wholly unrelated to the defendant's federal employment.\n</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER posits the case of a Yellowstone Park forest ranger accused of misdeeds at Coney Island. He says we would find Westfall Act immunity\u0097more accurately, we would uphold Westfall Act certification\u0097 even if the ranger's \"presen[ce] on Coney Island must have been . . . on a frolic of his own.\" <i>Post,</i> at 902-903. If Justice BREYER is imagining a case in which the ranger was in fact on a frolic at Coney Island, but the Attorney General nevertheless issued a Westfall Act certificate, we would not approve the certification. In that imaginary case, there would be no sense in which the ranger was acting within the scope of his employment <i>at the time</i> of the incident charged in the plaintiff's complaint. If, instead, Justice BREYER has in mind a ranger accused of frolicking at Coney Island, when all the while he stayed close to his desk at Yellowstone Park, then Justice BREYER is correct: Westfall Act immunity might be available under our approach. If such a case ever shows up in a federal court, however, the district judge might be called upon to determine whether removal and substitution under \u00a7 2679(d)(2) are limited by a nexus requirement similar to the one that limits removal under \u00a7 1442.</p>\n<p>[15]  The overlap of certification validity and the merits of the plaintiff's claim, evident here, is uncommon. It is unlikely to occur when the plaintiff alleges negligent conduct. The question whether a federal driver was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of an accident, for example, can generally be answered without simultaneously determining whether the federal employee drove negligently or carefully. And even when the plaintiff alleges an intentional tort, it may be possible to resolve the scope-of-employment question without deciding the merits of the claim. If a plaintiff charges a federal employee with sexual assault, for example, upon determining that there was sexual contact, a district court could find that the employee acted outside the scope of his duties, leaving the question whether the contact was consensual for jury resolution.</p>\n<p>[16]  But cf. 995 F.2d, at 1137 (observing that \"[i]n the ordinary tort claim arising when a government driver negligently runs into another car, jury trial is precisely what is lost to a plaintiff when the government is substituted for the employee\").</p>\n<p>[17]  We do not address the case in which the Attorney General refuses certification. In that event, \u00a7 2679(d)(3) allows the named defendant to \"petition the court to find and certify that [he] was acting within the scope of his . . . employment.\" However, the Westfall Act gives the named defendant no right to remove an uncertified case. But see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1). That right is accorded to the Attorney General only. Because the scope determination would be made in such a case before any substitution of the United States as defendant takes place, it is arguable that a jury trial of that issue would be required if the case is before a federal court. If the case was brought in a state court and the Attorney General declines to remove, the Seventh Amendment would not figure in the case, for it is inapplicable to proceedings in state court. <i>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98733\"><a href=\"/opinion/98733/minneapolis-st-louis-r-co-v-bombolis/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 217, 36 S.Ct. 595, 60 L.Ed. 961 (1916).</p>\n<p>[18]  Justice BREYER suggests that, with respect to immunity defenses, our \"reading of the Westfall Act works a major change in th[e] [ordinary] fact/law relationship.\" <i>Post,</i> at 904-905. Nothing in our opinion touches on that relationship in the typical case in which a defendant official raises a defense of absolute or qualified immunity. We simply observe that the Westfall Act grants federal employees a species of immunity, and that, under our jurisprudence, immunity-related questions should be resolved at the earliest opportunity. Justice BREYER is right, however, to this extent. We recognize that judges have a greater factfinding role in Westfall Act cases than they traditionally have in other immunity contexts. The Act makes that inevitable. When Westfall Act immunity is in dispute, a district court is called upon to decide who the proper defendant is: the named federal employee, or the United States. That decision cannot be left for jury resolution late in proceedings without undermining the Westfall Act's very purpose: to shift the burden of defending the suit to the United States whenever the defendant-employee was, at the relevant time, acting within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p>[1]  The exception to \u00a7 1447(d) created in <i>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109348\"><a href=\"/opinion/109348/thermtron-products-inc-v-hermansdorfer/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976), for remands not authorized by \u00a7 1447(c) does not apply here because the District Court remanded the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a ground enumerated in \u00a7 1447(c).</p>\n<p>[2]  The circumstances of this case make it clear that <i>Waco</i> ought to endure as an exception to \u00a7 1447(d), a question left open in <i>Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust,</i> 547 U.S. ___, ___, n. 13, 126 S.Ct. 2145, 2156, n. 13, 165 L.Ed.2d 92 (2006). A contrary rule would preclude appellate review not only of the remand order itself, but also of the refusal to substitute the Government as defendant.</p>\n<p>[1]  The remaining clause of \u00a7 1447(d) provides an exception that is not applicable here: \"except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  Section 1447(c) has since been amended, specifying as grounds for mandatory remand that \"the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  The <i>Thermtron Products</i> limitation upon the \u00a7 1447(d) bar to appellate review does not affect this case. As the Court recognizes, <i>ante,</i> at 905, the District Court was perfectly clear that its remand to state court was based on its lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>[4]  Like the Court, I need not address whether allowing the case to remain in federal court after declining to substitute the United States as defendant would create an Article III problem. Unlike the Court, however, I choose not to address the point in dicta. See <i>ante,</i> at 895-896 (noting that \"the question would only arise if\" certain events take place, yet answering the question anyway).</p>\n\n</div>",
