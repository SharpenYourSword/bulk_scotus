The Sixth Circuit, along with some other lower courts, adopted several procedural rules designed to implement this exhaustion requirement and facilitate early judicial screening. These rules require a prisoner to allege and demonstrate exhaustion in his complaint, permit suit only against defendants who were identified by the prisoner in his grievance, and require courts to dismiss the entire action if the prisoner fails to satisfy the exhaustion requirement as to any single claim in his complaint. Other lower courts declined to adopt such rules. We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict and now conclude that these rules are not required by the PLRA, and that crafting and imposing them exceeds the proper limits on the judicial role.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Prisoner litigation continues to \"account for an outsized share of filings\" in federal district courts. <i>Woodford v. Ngo,</i> 548 U.S. ___, ___, n. 4, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (2006) (slip op., at 12, n. 4). In 2005, nearly 10 percent of all civil cases filed in federal courts nationwide were prisoner complaints challenging prison conditions or claiming civil rights violations.<sup>[1]</sup> Most of these cases have no merit; many are frivolous. Our legal system, however, remains committed to guaranteeing that prisoner claims of illegal conduct by their custodians are fairly handled according to law. The challenge lies in ensuring that the flood of nonmeritorious claims does not submerge and effectively preclude consideration of the allegations with merit. See <i>Neitzke v. Williams,</i> 490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p>Congress addressed that challenge in the PLRA. What this country needs, Congress decided, is fewer and better prisoner suits. See <i>Porter v. Nussle,</i> 534 U.S. 516, 524, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002) (PLRA intended to \"reduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits\"). To that end, Congress enacted a variety of reforms designed to filter out the bad claims and facilitate consideration of the good. Key among these was the requirement that inmates complaining about prison conditions exhaust prison grievance remedies before initiating a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>The exhaustion provision of the PLRA states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [42 U.S.C. § 1983], or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).</blockquote>\n<p>Requiring exhaustion allows prison officials an opportunity to resolve disputes concerning the exercise of their responsibilities before being haled into court. This has the potential to reduce the number of inmate suits, and also to improve the quality <span class=\"star-pagination\">*915</span> of suits that are filed by producing a useful administrative record. <i>Woodford, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 12). In an attempt to implement the exhaustion requirement, some lower courts have imposed procedural rules that have become the subject of varying levels of disagreement among the federal courts of appeals.</p>\n<p>The first question presented centers on a conflict over whether exhaustion under the PLRA is a pleading requirement the prisoner must satisfy in his complaint or an affirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove.<sup>[2]</sup> The Sixth Circuit, adopting the former view, requires prisoners to attach proof of exhaustiontypically copies of the grievancesto their complaints to avoid dismissal. If no written record of the grievance is available, the inmate must plead with specificity how and when he exhausted the grievance procedures. <i>Knuckles El v. Toombs,</i> 215 F.3d 640, 642 (2000).</p>\n<p>The next issue concerns how courts determine whether a prisoner has properly exhausted administrative remediesspecifically, the level of detail required in a grievance to put the prison and individual officials on notice of the claim. The Sixth Circuit requires that a prisoner have identified, in the first step of the grievance process, each individual later named in the lawsuit to properly exhaust administrative remedies. <i>Burton v. Jones,</i> 321 F.3d 569, 575 (2003). Other circuits have taken varying approaches to this question, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Butler v. Adams,</i> 397 F.3d 1181, 1183 (C.A.9 2005) (proper exhaustion requires use of the administrative process provided by the State; if that process does not require identification of specific persons, neither does the PLRA); <i>Johnson v. Johnson,</i> 385 F.3d 503, 522 (C.A.5 2004) (\"[T]he grievance must provide administrators with a fair opportunity under the circumstances to address the problem that will later form the basis of the suit\"); <i>Riccardo v. Rausch,</i> 375 F.3d 521, 524 (C.A.7 2004) (exhaustion satisfied if grievance \"served its function of alerting the state and inviting corrective action\"), none going as far as the Sixth Circuit in requiring in every case that the defendants have been named from the beginning of the grievance process.</p>\n<p>Finally, the circuits are divided over what the PLRA requires when both exhausted and unexhausted claims are included in a complaint.<sup>[3]</sup> Some circuits, including <span class=\"star-pagination\">*916</span> the Sixth Circuit, apply a \"total exhaustion\" rule, under which no part of the suit may proceed if any single claim in the action is not properly exhausted. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Jones Bey v. Johnson,</i> 407 F.3d 801, 805 (C.A.6 2005). Among circuits requiring total exhaustion there is further disagreement over what to do if the requirement is not met. Most courts allow the prisoner to amend his complaint to include only exhausted claims, <i>e.g., </i><i>Kozohorsky v. Harmon,</i> 332 F.3d 1141, 1144 (C.A.8 2003), but the Sixth Circuit denies leave to amend, dismisses the action, and requires that it be filed anew with only unexhausted claims, <i>Baxter v. Rose,</i> 305 F.3d 486, 488 (2002); <i>Jones Bey, supra,</i> at 807. See also <i>McGore v. Wrigglesworth,</i> 114 F.3d 601, 612 (1997). Other circuits reject total exhaustion altogether, instead dismissing only unexhausted claims and considering the rest on the merits. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ortiz v. McBride,</i> 380 F.3d 649, 663 (C.A.2 2004).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Petitioners are inmates in the custody of the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC). At the time petitioners filed their grievances, MDOC Policy Directive 03.02.130 (Nov. 1, 2000) set forth the applicable grievance procedures. 1 App. 138-157.<sup>[4]</sup> The policy directive describes what issues are grievable and contains instructions for filing and processing grievances.</p>\n<p>Inmates must first attempt to resolve a problem orally within two business days of becoming aware of the grievable issue. <i>Id.,</i> at 147. If oral resolution is unsuccessful, the inmate may proceed to Step I of the grievance process, and submit a completed grievance form within five business days of the attempted oral resolution. <i>Id.,</i> at 147, 149-150. The Step I grievance form provided by MDOC (a one-page form on which the inmate fills out identifying information and is given space to describe the complaint) advises inmates to be \"brief and concise in describing your grievance issue.\" 2 <i>id.,</i> at 1. The inmate submits the grievance to a designated grievance coordinator, who assigns it to a respondent generally the supervisor of the person being grieved. 1 <i>id.,</i> at 150.</p>\n<p>If the inmate is dissatisfied with the Step I response, he may appeal to Step II by obtaining an appeal form within five business days of the response, and submitting the appeal within five business days of obtaining the form. <i>Id.,</i> at 152. The respondent at Step II is designated by the policy, <i>id.,</i> at 152-153 (<i>e.g.,</i> the regional health administrator for medical care grievances). If still dissatisfied after Step II, the inmate may further appeal to Step III using the same appeal form; the MDOC director is designated as respondent for all Step III appeals. <i>Id.,</i> at 154.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Lorenzo Jones</i></h2>\n<p>Petitioner Lorenzo Jones is incarcerated at the MDOC's Saginaw Correctional Facility. In November 2000, while in MDOC's custody, Jones was involved in a vehicle accident and suffered significant injuries to his neck and back. Several months later Jones was given a work assignment he allegedly could not perform in light of his injuries. According to Jones, respondent Paul Morrisonin charge of work assignments at the prisonmade the inappropriate assignment, even though he knew of Jones's injuries. When Jones reported to the assignment, he informed the staff member in chargerespondent Michael Opanasenkothat he could not perform <span class=\"star-pagination\">*917</span> the work; Opanasenko allegedly told him to do the work or \"`suffer the consequences.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 20. Jones performed the required tasks and allegedly aggravated his injuries. After unsuccessfully seeking redress through the MDOC's grievance process, Jones filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for deliberate indifference to medical needs, retaliation, and harassment. Jones named as defendants, in addition to Morrison and Opanasenko, respondents Barbara Bock (the warden), Valerie Chaplin (a deputy warden), Janet Konkle (a registered nurse), and Ahmad Aldabaugh (a physician).</p>\n<p>A Magistrate recommended dismissal for failure to state a claim with respect to Bock, Chaplin, Konkle, and Aldabaugh, and the District Court agreed. 1 App. 41. With respect to Morrison and Opanasenko, however, the Magistrate recommended that the suit proceed, finding that Jones had exhausted his administrative remedies as to those two. <i>Id.,</i> at 18-29. The District Court disagreed. In his complaint, Jones provided the dates on which his claims were filed at various steps of the MDOC grievance procedures. <i>Id.,</i> at 41. He did not, however, attach copies of the grievance forms or describe the proceedings with specificity. Respondents attached copies of all of Jones's grievances to their own motion to dismiss, but the District Judge ruled that Jones's failure to meet his burden to plead exhaustion in his complaint could not be cured by respondents. <i>Id.,</i> at 42. The Sixth Circuit agreed, holding both that Jones failed to comply with the specific pleading requirements applied to PLRA suits, 135 Fed. Appx. 837, 839 (2005) <i>(per curiam)</i> (citing <i>Knuckles El,</i> 215 F.3d, at 642), and that, even if Jones had shown that he exhausted the claims against Morrison and Opanasenko, dismissal was still required under the total exhaustion rule, 135 Fed.Appx., at 839 (citing <i>Jones Bey,</i> 407 F.3d, at 806).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Timothy Williams</i></h2>\n<p>Petitioner Timothy Williams is incarcerated at the MDOC's Adrian Correctional Facility. He suffers from noninvoluting cavernous hemangiomas in his right arm, a medical condition that causes pain, immobility, and disfigurement of the limb, and for which he has undergone several surgeries. An MDOC physician recommended further surgery to provide pain relief, but MDOC's Correctional Medical Services denied the recommendation (and subsequent appeals by the doctor) on the ground that the danger of surgery outweighed the benefits, which it viewed as cosmetic. The MDOC Medical Services Advisory Committee upheld this decision. After Correctional Medical Services indicated that it would take the request under advisement, Williams filed a grievance objecting to the quality of his medical care and seeking authorization for the surgery. He later filed another grievance complaining that he was denied a single-occupancy handicapped cell, allegedly necessary to accommodate his medical condition. After both grievances were denied at all stages, Williams filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Michigan under § 1983, naming as respondents William Overton (former director of MDOC), David Jamrog (the warden), Mary Jo Pass and Paul Klee (assistant deputy wardens), Chad Markwell (corrections officer), Bonnie Peterson (health unit manager), and Dr. George Pramstaller (chief medical officer for MDOC).</p>\n<p>The District Judge found that Williams had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to his medical care claim because he had not identified any of the respondents named in his lawsuit during <span class=\"star-pagination\">*918</span> the grievance process.<sup>[5]</sup> Although Williams's claim concerning the handicapped cell had been properly exhausted, the District Judgeapplying the total exhaustion ruledismissed the entire suit. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. 136 Fed. Appx. 859, 861-863 (2005) (citing <i>Burton,</i> 321 F.3d, at 574, <i>Curry v. Scott,</i> 249 F.3d 493, 504-505 (C.A.6 2001), and <i>Jones Bey,</i> 407 F.3d, at 805).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>John Walton</i></h2>\n<p>Petitioner John Walton is incarcerated at the MDOC's Alger Maximum Correctional Facility. After assaulting a guard, he was sanctioned with an indefinite \"upper slot\" restriction.<sup>[6]</sup> Several months later, upon learning that other prisoners had been given upper slot restrictions of only three months for the same infraction, he filed a grievance claiming that this disparity was the result of racial discrimination (Walton is black, the two other prisoners he identified in his grievances are white). After the grievance was denied, Walton filed a complaint in the Western District of Michigan under § 1983, claiming race discrimination. He named as respondents Barbara Bouchard (former warden), Ken Gearin, David Bergh, and Ron Bobo (assistant deputy wardens), Catherine Bauman (resident unit manager), and Denise Gerth (assistant resident unit supervisor).</p>\n<p>The District Judge dismissed the lawsuit because Walton had not named any respondent other than Bobo in his grievance. His claims against the other respondents were thus not properly exhausted, and the court dismissed the entire action under the total exhaustion rule. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, reiterating its requirement that a prisoner must \"file a grievance against the person he ultimately seeks to sue,\" <i>Curry, supra,</i> at 505, and that this requirement can only be satisfied by naming each defendant at Step I of the MDOC grievance process. Because Walton had exhausted prison remedies only as to respondent Bobo, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the entire action. 136 Fed.Appx. 846, 848-849 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Jones sought review in a petition for certiorari, arguing that the Sixth Circuit's heightened pleading requirement and total exhaustion rule contravene the clear language of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the PLRA. Williams and Walton filed a joint petition under this Court's Rule 12.4, contending that the rule requiring every defendant to be named during the grievance process is not required by the PLRA, and also challenging the total exhaustion rule. We granted both petitions for certiorari, 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 246 (2006), and consolidated the cases for our review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*919</span> that unexhausted claims cannot be brought in court. <i>Porter,</i> 534 U.S., at 524, 122 S.Ct. 983. What is less clear is whether it falls to the prisoner to plead and demonstrate exhaustion in the complaint, or to the defendant to raise lack of exhaustion as an affirmative defense. The minority rule, adopted by the Sixth Circuit, places the burden of pleading exhaustion in a case covered by the PLRA on the prisoner; most courts view failure to exhaust as an affirmative defense. See n. 2, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>We think petitioners, and the majority of courts to consider the question, have the better of the argument. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires simply a \"short and plain statement of the claim\" in a complaint, while Rule 8(c) identifies a nonexhaustive list of affirmative defenses that must be pleaded in response. The PLRA itself is not a source of a prisoner's claim; claims covered by the PLRA are typically brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which does not require exhaustion at all, see <i>Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla.,</i> 457 U.S. 496, 516, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982). Petitioners assert that courts typically regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense in other contexts, see Brief for Petitioners 34-36, and nn. 12-13 (citing cases), and respondents do not seriously dispute the general proposition. We have referred to exhaustion in these terms, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corp.,</i> 525 U.S. 70, 75, 119 S.Ct. 391, 142 L.Ed.2d 361 (1998) (referring to \"failure to exhaust\" as an \"affirmative defens[e]\"), including in the similar statutory scheme governing habeas corpus, <i>Day v. McDonough,</i> 547 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 1675 (2006) (slip op., at 8) (referring to exhaustion as a \"defense\"). The PLRA dealt extensively with the subject of exhaustion, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 1997e(a), (c)(2), but is silent on the issue whether exhaustion must be pleaded by the plaintiff or is an affirmative defense. This is strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed, and the usual practice under the Federal Rules is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>In a series of recent cases, we have explained that courts should generally not depart from the usual practice under the Federal Rules on the basis of perceived policy concerns. Thus, in <i>Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit,</i> 507 U.S. 163, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993), we unanimously reversed the court of appeals for imposing a heightened pleading standard in § 1983 suits against municipalities. We explained that \"[p]erhaps if [the] Rules. . . were rewritten today, claims against municipalities under § 1983 might be subjected to the added specificity requirement. . . . But that is a result which must be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 168, 113 S.Ct. 1160.</p>\n<p>In <i>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,</i> 534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002), we unanimously reversed the court of appeals for requiring employment discrimination plaintiffs to specifically allege the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination. We explained that \"the Federal Rules do not contain a heightened pleading standard for employment discrimination suits,\" and a \"requirement of greater specificity for particular claims\" must be obtained by amending the Federal Rules. <i>Id.,</i> at 515, 122 S.Ct. 992 (citing <i>Leatherman</i>). And just last Term, in <i>Hill v. McDonough,</i> 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44 (2006), we unanimously rejected a proposal that § 1983 suits challenging a method of execution must identify an acceptable alternative: \"Specific pleading requirements are mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and not, as a general rule, through case-by-case determinations of the federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*920</span> courts.\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2096 (slip op., at 8) (citing <i>Swierkiewicz</i>).</p>\n<p>The Sixth Circuit and other courts requiring prisoners to plead and demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints contend that if the \"new regime\" mandated by the PLRA for prisoner complaints is to function effectively, prisoner complaints must be treated outside of this typical framework. See <i>Baxter,</i> 305 F.3d, at 489. These courts explain that the PLRA not only imposed a new mandatory exhaustion requirement, but also departed in a fundamental way from the usual procedural ground rules by requiring judicial screening to filter out nonmeritorious claims: Courts are to screen inmate complaints \"before docketing, if feasible, or . . . as soon as practicable after docketing,\" and dismiss the complaint if it is \"frivolous, malicious, . . . fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted[,] or . . . seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\" 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915A(a), (b). All this may take place before any responsive pleading is filed unlike in the typical civil case, defendants do not have to respond to a complaint covered by the PLRA until required to do so by the court, and waiving the right to reply does not constitute an admission of the allegations in the complaint. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(g)(1), (2). According to respondents, these departures from the normal litigation framework of complaint and response mandate a different pleading requirement for prisoner complaints, if the screening is to serve its intended purpose. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Baxter, supra,</i> at 489 (\"This court's heightened pleading standards for complaints covered by the PLRA are designed to facilitate the Act's screening requirements. . .\"); <i>Knuckles El,</i> 215 F.3d, at 642. See also Brief for Respondents 17.</p>\n<p>We think that the PLRA's screening requirement does notexplicitly or implicitlyjustify deviating from the usual procedural practice beyond the departures specified by the PLRA itself. Before the PLRA, the <i>in forma pauperis</i> provision of § 1915, applicable to most prisoner litigation, permitted <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal only if an action was frivolous or malicious. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) (1994 ed.); see also <i>Neitzke,</i> 490 U.S., at 320, 109 S.Ct. 1827 (concluding that a complaint that fails to state a claim was not frivolous under § 1915(d) and thus could not be dismissed <i>sua sponte</i>). In the PLRA, Congress added failure to state a claim and seeking monetary relief from a defendant immune from such relief as grounds for <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal of <i>in forma pauperis</i> cases, § 1915(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.), and provided for judicial screening and <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal of prisoner suits on the same four grounds, § 1915A(b); 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(c)(1). Although exhaustion was a \"centerpiece\" of the PLRA, <i>Woodford,</i> 548 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 1-2), failure to exhaust was notably not added in terms to this enumeration. There is thus no reason to suppose that the normal pleading rules have to be altered to facilitate judicial screening of complaints specifically for failure to exhaust.</p>\n<p>Some courts have found that exhaustion is subsumed under the PLRA's enumerated ground authorizing early dismissal for \"fail[ure] to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\" 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915A(b)(1), 1915(e)(2)(B); 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(c)(1). See <i>Baxter, supra,</i> at 489; <i>Steele v. Federal Bureau of Prisons,</i> 355 F.3d 1204, 1210 (C.A.10 2003); <i>Rivera v. Allin,</i> 144 F.3d 719, 731 (C.A.11 1998). The point is a bit of a red herring. A complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim if the allegations, taken as true, show the plaintiff is not entitled to relief. If the allegations, for example, show that relief is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, the complaint is subject <span class=\"star-pagination\">*921</span> to dismissal for failure to state a claim; that does not make the statute of limitations any less an affirmative defense, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). Whether a particular ground for opposing a claim may be the basis for dismissal for failure to state a claim depends on whether the allegations in the complaint suffice to establish that ground, not on the nature of the ground in the abstract. See <i>Leveto v. Lapina,</i> 258 F.3d 156, 161 (C.A.3 2001) (\"[A] complaint may be subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) when an affirmative defense ... appears on its face\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). See also <i>Lopez-Gonzalez v. Municipality of Comerio,</i> 404 F.3d 548, 551 (C.A.1 2005) (dismissing a complaint barred by the statute of limitations under Rule 12(b)(6)); <i>Pani v. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield,</i> 152 F.3d 67, 74-75 (C.A.2 1998) (dismissing a complaint barred by official immunity under Rule 12(b)(6)). See also 5B C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1357, pp. 708-710, 721-729 (3d ed.2004). Determining that Congress meant to include failure to exhaust under the rubric of \"failure to state a claim\" in the screening provisions of the PLRA would thus not support treating exhaustion as a pleading requirement rather than an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>The argument that screening would be more effective if exhaustion had to be shown in the complaint proves too much; the same could be said with respect to any affirmative defense. The rejoinder that the PLRA focused on exhaustion rather than other defenses simply highlights the failure of Congress to include exhaustion in terms among the enumerated grounds justifying dismissal upon early screening. As noted, that is not to say that failure to exhaust cannot be a basis for dismissal for failure to state a claim. It is to say that there is no basis for concluding that Congress implicitly meant to transform exhaustion from an affirmative defense to a pleading requirement by the curiously indirect route of specifying that courts should screen PLRA complaints and dismiss those that fail to state a claim.</p>\n<p>Respondents point to 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(g) as confirming that the usual pleading rules should not apply to PLRA suits, but we think that provision supports petitioners. It specifies that defendants can waive their right to reply to a prisoner complaint without the usual consequence of being deemed to have admitted the allegations in the complaint. See § 1997e(g)(1) (allowing defendants to waive their response without admitting the allegations \"[n]otwithstanding any other law or rule of procedure\"). This shows that when Congress meant to depart from the usual procedural requirements, it did so expressly.</p>\n<p>We conclude that failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints. We understand the reasons behind the decisions of some lower courts to impose a pleading requirement on plaintiffs in this context, but that effort cannot fairly be viewed as an interpretation of the PLRA. \"Whatever temptations the statesmanship of policy-making might wisely suggest,\" the judge's job is to construe the statutenot to make it better. Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L.Rev. 527, 533 (1947). The judge \"must not read in by way of creation,\" but instead abide by the \"duty of restraint, th[e] humility of function as merely the translator of another's command.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 533-534. See <i>United States v. Goldenberg,</i> 168 U.S. 95, 103, 18 S.Ct. 3, 42 L.Ed. 394 (1897) (\"No mere omission ... which it may seem wise to have specifically provided for, justif[ies] any judicial addition to the language of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*922</span> statute\"). Given that the PLRA does not itself require plaintiffs to plead exhaustion, such a result \"must be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.\" <i>Leatherman,</i> 507 U.S., at 168, 113 S.Ct. 1160.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Sixth Circuit threw out the Williams and Walton suits because those prisoners had not identified in their initial grievances each defendant they later sued. 136 Fed.Appx., at 862-863; <i>id.,</i> at 848-849. See <i>Burton,</i> 321 F.3d, at 575.<sup>[7]</sup> Here again the lower court's procedural rule lacks a textual basis in the PLRA. The PLRA requires exhaustion of \"such administrative remedies as are available,\" 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), but nothing in the statute imposes a \"name all defendants\" requirement along the lines of the Sixth Circuit's judicially created rule. Respondents argue that without such a rule the exhaustion requirement would become a \"`useless appendage,'\" Brief for Respondents 44 (quoting <i>Woodford,</i> 548 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 11)), but the assertion is hyperbole, and the citation of <i>Woodford</i> misplaced.</p>\n<p><i>Woodford</i> held that \"proper exhaustion\" was required under the PLRA, and that this requirement was not satisfied when grievances were dismissed because prisoners had missed deadlines set by the grievance policy. <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 11-13). At the time each of the grievances at issue here was filed, in contrast, the MDOC policy did not contain any provision specifying who must be named in a grievance. MDOC's policy required only that prisoners \"be as specific as possible\" in their grievances, 1 App. 148, while at the same time the required forms advised them to \"[b]e brief and concise.\" 2 <i>id.,</i> at 1. The MDOC grievance form does not require a prisoner to identify a particular responsible party, and the respondent is not necessarily the allegedly culpable prison official, but rather an administrative official designated in the policy to respond to particular types of grievances at different levels. <i>Supra,</i> at 6. The grievance policy specifically provides that the grievant at Step I \"shall have the opportunity to explain the grievance more completely at [an] interview, enabling the Step I respondent to gather any additional information needed to respond to the grievance.\" 1 App. 151. Nothing in the MDOC policy itself supports the conclusion that the grievance process was improperly invoked simply because an individual later named as a defendant was not named at the first step of the grievance process.</p>\n<p>Nor does the PLRA impose such a requirement. In <i>Woodford,</i> we held that to properly exhaust administrative remedies prisoners must \"complete the administrative review process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules,\" 548 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 5)rules that are defined not by the PLRA, but by the prison grievance process itself. Compliance with prison grievance procedures, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*923</span> therefore, is all that is required by the PLRA to \"properly exhaust.\" The level of detail necessary in a grievance to comply with the grievance procedures will vary from system to system and claim to claim, but it is the prison's requirements, and not the PLRA, that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion. As the MDOC's procedures make no mention of naming particular officials, the Sixth Circuit's rule imposing such a prerequisite to proper exhaustion is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>We have identified the benefits of exhaustion to include allowing a prison to address complaints about the program it administers before being subjected to suit, reducing litigation to the extent complaints are satisfactorily resolved, and improving litigation that does occur by leading to the preparation of a useful record. See <i>id.,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 6-8); <i>Porter,</i> 534 U.S., at 524-525, 122 S.Ct. 983. The Sixth Circuit rule may promote early notice to those who might later be sued, but that has not been thought to be one of the leading purposes of the exhaustion requirement. See <i>Johnson,</i> 385 F.3d, at 522 (\"We are mindful that the primary purpose of a grievance is to alert prison officials to a problem, not to provide personal notice to a particular official that he may be sued; the grievance is not a summons and complaint that initiates adversarial litigation\"); see also Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 8-9, and n. 6 (collecting grievance procedures and noting that the majority do not require prisoners to identify specific individuals).</p>\n<p>We do not determine whether the grievances filed by petitioners satisfied the requirement of \"proper exhaustion,\" <i>Woodford, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 11), but simply conclude that exhaustion is not <i>per se</i> inadequate simply because an individual later sued was not named in the grievances. We leave it to the court below in the first instance to determine the sufficiency of the exhaustion in these cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The final issue concerns how courts should address complaints in which the prisoner has failed to exhaust some, but not all, of the claims asserted in the complaint.<sup>[8]</sup> All agree that no unexhausted claim may be considered. The issue is whether the court should proceed with the exhausted claims, or insteadas the Sixth Circuit has helddismiss the entire action if any one claim is not properly exhausted. See <i>Jones Bey,</i> 407 F.3d, at 807.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Here the Sixth Circuit can point to language in the PLRA in support of its rule. Section 1997e(a) provides that \"[n]o action shall be brought\" unless administrative procedures are exhausted. Respondents argue that if Congress intended courts to dismiss only unexhausted claims while retaining the balance of the lawsuit, the word <span class=\"star-pagination\">*924</span> \"claim\" rather than \"action\" would have been used in this provision.</p>\n<p>This statutory phrasing\"no action shall be brought\"is boilerplate language. There are many instances in the Federal Code where similar language is used, but such language has not been thought to lead to the dismissal of an entire action if a single claim fails to meet the pertinent standards. Statutes of limitations, for example, are often introduced by a variant of the phrase \"no action shall be brought,\" see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Beach v. Ocwen Fed. Bank,</i> 523 U.S. 410, 416, 118 S.Ct. 1408, 140 L.Ed.2d 566 (1998); 18 U.S.C. § 1030(g) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), but we have never heard of an entire complaint being thrown out simply because one of several discrete claims was barred by the statute of limitations, and it is hard to imagine what purpose such a rule would serve. The same is true with respect to other uses of the \"no action shall be brought\" phrasing. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Hawksbill Sea Turtle v. Federal Emergency Management Agency,</i> 126 F.3d 461, 471 (C.A.3 1997) (dismissing only claims that fail to comply with the citizen suit notification requirement of 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(2), which states that \"[n]o action may be commenced\" until an agency has declined to act after being given written notice).</p>\n<p>More generally, statutory references to an \"action\" have not typically been read to mean that every claim included in the action must meet the pertinent requirement before the \"action\" may proceed. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc.,</i> 545 U.S. 546, 560-563, 125 S.Ct. 2611, 162 L.Ed.2d 502 (2005) (District Court had jurisdiction over a \"civil action\" under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), even if it might not have jurisdiction over each separate claim comprising the action); <i>Chicago v. International College of Surgeons,</i> 522 U.S. 156, 166, 118 S.Ct. 523, 139 L.Ed.2d 525 (1997) (District Court had jurisdiction over removed \"civil action\" even if every claim did not satisfy jurisdictional prerequisites).</p>\n<p>As a general matter, if a complaint contains both good and bad claims, the court proceeds with the good and leaves the bad. \"[O]nly the bad claims are dismissed; the complaint as a whole is not. If Congress meant to depart from this norm, we would expect some indication of that, and we find none.\" <i>Robinson v. Page,</i> 170 F.3d 747, 748-749 (C.A.7 1999) (considering § 1997e(e)).</p>\n<p>Respondents note an exception to this general rule, the total exhaustion rule in habeas corpus. In <i>Rose v. Lundy,</i> 455 U.S. 509, 522, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982), we held that \"mixed\" habeas petitionscontaining both exhausted and unexhausted claimscannot be adjudicated. This total exhaustion rule applied in habeas was initially derived from considerations of \"comity and federalism,\" not any statutory command. <i>Rhines v. Weber,</i> 544 U.S. 269, 273, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005); <i>id.,</i> at 274, 125 S.Ct. 1528 (noting that Congress \"preserved <i>Lundy's</i> total exhaustion requirement\" in 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A)). Separate claims in a single habeas petition generally seek the same relief from custody, and success on one is often as good as success on another. In such a case it makes sense to require exhaustion of all claims in state court before allowing the federal action to proceed. A typical PLRA suit with multiple claims, on the other hand, may combine a wide variety of discrete complaints, about interactions with guards, prison conditions, generally applicable rules, and so on, seeking different relief on each claim. There is no reason failure to exhaust on one necessarily affects any other. In any event, even if the habeas total exhaustion rule is pertinent, it does not in fact depart from the usual practiceas we recently held, a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*925</span> court presented with a mixed habeas petition \"should allow the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims ....\" <i>Rhines, supra,</i> at 278, 125 S.Ct. 1528. This is the opposite of the rule the Sixth Circuit adopted, and precisely the rule that respondents argue against.</p>\n<p>Respondents' reading of 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) to contain a total exhaustion rule is bolstered by the fact that other sections of the PLRA distinguish between actions and claims. Section 1997e(c)(1), for example, provides that a court shall dismiss an <i>action</i> for one of four enumerated deficiencies, while § 1997e(c)(2) allows a court to dismiss a <i>claim</i> for one of these reasons without first determining whether the claim is exhausted. Similarly, 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b) directs district courts to dismiss \"the complaint, or any portion of the complaint\" before docketing under certain circumstances. This demonstrates that Congress knew how to differentiate between the entire action and particular claims when it wanted to, and suggests that its use of \"action\" rather than \"claim\" in 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) should be given effect.</p>\n<p>But the interpretation respondents advocate creates its own inconsistencies. Section 1997e(e) contains similar language, \"[n]o ... action may be brought ... for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury,\" yet respondents cite no case interpreting this provision to require dismissal of the entire lawsuit if only one claim does not comply, and again we see little reason for such an approach. Accord, <i>Cassidy v. Indiana Dept. of Corrections,</i> 199 F.3d 374, 376-377 (C.A.7 2000) (dismissing only the portions of the complaint barred by § 1997e(e)); see also <i>Williams v. Ollis,</i> 230 F.3d 1361 (C.A.6 2000) (unpublished table decision) (same). Interpreting the phrase \"no action shall be brought\" to require dismissal of the entire case under § 1997e(a) but not § 1997e(e) would contravene our normal rules of statutory construction. <i>National Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 522 U.S. 479, 501-502, 118 S.Ct. 927, 140 L.Ed.2d 1 (1998).</p>\n<p>In pressing the total exhaustion argument, respondents also marshal the policy and purpose underlying the PLRAthis time in a supporting rather than lead role. The invigorated exhaustion requirement is a \"centerpiece\" of the statute, <i>Woodford,</i> 548 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 1-2), and if the exhaustion requirement of § 1997e(a) is not effectuated by a total exhaustion rule, they argue, inmates will have little incentive to ensure that they have exhausted all available administrative remedies before proceeding to court. The PLRA mandated early judicial screening to reduce the burden of prisoner litigation on the courts; a total exhaustion rule allows courts promptly to dismiss an action upon identifying an unexhausted claim. The alternative approach turns judges into editors of prisoner complaints, rather than creating an incentive for prisoners to exhaust properly. See <i>Ross v. County of Bernalillo,</i> 365 F.3d 1181, 1190 (C.A.10 2004).</p>\n<p>We are not persuaded by these policy arguments. In fact, the effect of a total exhaustion rule could be that inmates will file various claims in separate suits, to avoid the possibility of an unexhausted claim tainting the others. That would certainly not comport with the purpose of the PLRA to reduce the quantity of inmate suits. Additionally, district judges who delve into a prisoner complaint only to realize it contains an unexhausted claim, requiring dismissal of the entire complaint under the total exhaustion rule, will often have to begin the process all over again <span class=\"star-pagination\">*926</span> when the prisoner refiles. In light of typically short prison grievance time limits, prisoners' refiled complaints will often be identical to what the district court would have considered had it simply dismissed unexhausted claims as it encountered them and proceeded with the exhausted ones. Perhaps filing fees and concerns about the applicability of the \"three strikes\" rule, 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g), would mitigate these effects, but the debate about consequences is close enough that there is no clear reason to depart from the more typical claim-by-claim approach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We are not insensitive to the challenges faced by the lower federal courts in managing their dockets and attempting to separate, when it comes to prisoner suits, not so much wheat from chaff as needles from haystacks. We once again reiterate, howeveras we did unanimously in <i>Leatherman, Swierkiewicz,</i> and <i>Hill</i>that adopting different and more onerous pleading rules to deal with particular categories of cases should be done through established rulemaking procedures, and not on a case-by-case basis by the courts.</p>\n<p>The judgments of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit are reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  See Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Judicial Facts and Figures, Tables 4.4, 4.6, http://www.uscourts.gov/ judicialfactsfigures/contents.html (as visited Jan. 17, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).

The new policy is not at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p>[5]  Dr. Pramstaller was mentioned at Step III of the grievance process, but was apparently never served with the complaint initiating the lawsuit. The Magistrate stated that even if the claims against Pramstaller had been properly exhausted they nonetheless were subject to dismissal under the total exhaustion rule. 1 App. 86, 101. It also appears that under the Sixth Circuit's rule requiring a defendant to be named at Step I of the grievance process, the claims against Pramstaller, who was not mentioned until Step III, would not have been exhausted. See <i>supra,</i> at 4; n. 7, <i>infra.</i> Because Pramstaller was never served, he is not a respondent in this Court.</p>\n<p>[6]  An upper slot restriction limits the inmate to receiving food and paperwork via the lower slot of the cell door. Brief for Respondents 5-6. Presumably, this is less desirable than access through the upper slot; the record does not reveal how effective this particular sanction is in discouraging assaults on staff.</p>\n<p>[7]  This \"name all defendants\" rule apparently applies even when a prisoner does not learn the identity of the responsible party until a later step of the grievance process. Upon learning the identity of the responsible party, the prisoner is required to bring an entirely new grievance to properly exhaust. 136 Fed. Appx. 846, 849 (C.A.6 2005) (\"At that point [after he learned, in response to a Step I grievance, that Gearin was responsible for the upper slot restriction], Walton was armed with all of the information that he needed to file a Step I grievance against ... Gearin and a federal complaint against Gearin once the claim had been exhaustedbut he simply chose not to follow this route\"). At oral argument, Michigan admitted that it did not agree with at least this application of the rule. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44-45.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although we reverse the Sixth Circuit's rulings on the substantive exhaustion requirements as to all three petitioners, the question whether a total exhaustion rule is contemplated by the PLRA is not moot. In Jones's case, the Sixth Circuit ruled in the alternative that total exhaustion required dismissal. 135 Fed. Appx. 837, 839 (C.A.6 2005) <i>(per curiam)</i> (\"[E]ven if Jones had shown he had exhausted some of his claims, the district court properly dismissed the complaint because Jones did not show that he had exhausted all of his claims\").</p>\n<p>[9]  After we granted certiorari, the Sixth Circuit suggested that the adoption of a total exhaustion rule in that Circuit in <i>Jones Bey</i> ran contrary to previous panel decisions and was therefore not controlling. <i>Spencer v. Bouchard,</i> 449 F.3d 721, 726 (2006). See also Rule 206(c) (CA6 2006). As total exhaustion was applied in the cases under review, and the Sixth Circuit is not the only court to apply this rule, we do not concern ourselves with this possible intracircuit split.</p>\n\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b>127 S.Ct. 910 (2007)</b></center>\n<center><h1>Lorenzo L.

The Sixth Circuit, along with some other lower courts, adopted several procedural rules designed to implement this exhaustion requirement and facilitate early judicial screening. These rules require a prisoner to allege and demonstrate exhaustion in his complaint, permit suit only against defendants who were identified by the prisoner in his grievance, and require courts to dismiss the entire action if the prisoner fails to satisfy the exhaustion requirement as to any single claim in his complaint. Other lower courts declined to adopt such rules. We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict and now conclude that these rules are not required by the PLRA, and that crafting and imposing them exceeds the proper limits on the judicial role.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Prisoner litigation continues to \"account for an outsized share of filings\" in federal district courts. <i>Woodford v. Ngo,</i> 548 U.S. ___, ___, n. 4, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (2006) (slip op., at 12, n. 4). In 2005, nearly 10 percent of all civil cases filed in federal courts nationwide were prisoner complaints challenging prison conditions or claiming civil rights violations.<sup>[1]</sup> Most of these cases have no merit; many are frivolous. Our legal system, however, remains committed to guaranteeing that prisoner claims of illegal conduct by their custodians are fairly handled according to law. The challenge lies in ensuring that the flood of nonmeritorious claims does not submerge and effectively preclude consideration of the allegations with merit. See <i>Neitzke v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112254\"><a href=\"/opinion/112254/neitzke-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p>Congress addressed that challenge in the PLRA. What this country needs, Congress decided, is fewer and better prisoner suits. See <i>Porter v. Nussle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118483\"><a href=\"/opinion/118483/porter-v-nussle/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span>, 524, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002) (PLRA intended to \"reduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits\"). To that end, Congress enacted a variety of reforms designed to filter out the bad claims and facilitate consideration of the good. Key among these was the requirement that inmates complaining about prison conditions exhaust prison grievance remedies before initiating a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>The exhaustion provision of the PLRA states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [42 U.S.C. § 1983], or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).</blockquote>\n<p>Requiring exhaustion allows prison officials an opportunity to resolve disputes concerning the exercise of their responsibilities before being haled into court. This has the potential to reduce the number of inmate suits, and also to improve the quality <span class=\"star-pagination\">*915</span> of suits that are filed by producing a useful administrative record. <i>Woodford, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 12). In an attempt to implement the exhaustion requirement, some lower courts have imposed procedural rules that have become the subject of varying levels of disagreement among the federal courts of appeals.</p>\n<p>The first question presented centers on a conflict over whether exhaustion under the PLRA is a pleading requirement the prisoner must satisfy in his complaint or an affirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove.<sup>[2]</sup> The Sixth Circuit, adopting the former view, requires prisoners to attach proof of exhaustiontypically copies of the grievancesto their complaints to avoid dismissal. If no written record of the grievance is available, the inmate must plead with specificity how and when he exhausted the grievance procedures. <i>Knuckles El v. Toombs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769071\"><a href=\"/opinion/769071/demetrius-knuckles-el-errick-e-payton-bey-michael-/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 642 (2000).</p>\n<p>The next issue concerns how courts determine whether a prisoner has properly exhausted administrative remediesspecifically, the level of detail required in a grievance to put the prison and individual officials on notice of the claim. The Sixth Circuit requires that a prisoner have identified, in the first step of the grievance process, each individual later named in the lawsuit to properly exhaust administrative remedies. <i>Burton v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781072\"><a href=\"/opinion/781072/ronnie-burton-v-wendee-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span>, 575 (2003).

Among circuits requiring total exhaustion there is further disagreement over what to do if the requirement is not met. Most courts allow the prisoner to amend his complaint to include only exhausted claims, <i>e.g., </i><i>Kozohorsky v.

Other circuits reject total exhaustion altogether, instead dismissing only unexhausted claims and considering the rest on the merits. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ortiz v.

At the time petitioners filed their grievances, MDOC Policy Directive 03.02.130 (Nov. 1, 2000) set forth the applicable grievance procedures. 1 App. 138-157.<sup>[4]</sup> The policy directive describes what issues are grievable and contains instructions for filing and processing grievances.</p>\n<p>Inmates must first attempt to resolve a problem orally within two business days of becoming aware of the grievable issue. <i>Id.,</i> at 147. If oral resolution is unsuccessful, the inmate may proceed to Step I of the grievance process, and submit a completed grievance form within five business days of the attempted oral resolution. <i>Id.,</i> at 147, 149-150. The Step I grievance form provided by MDOC (a one-page form on which the inmate fills out identifying information and is given space to describe the complaint) advises inmates to be \"brief and concise in describing your grievance issue.\" 2 <i>id.,</i> at 1. The inmate submits the grievance to a designated grievance coordinator, who assigns it to a respondent generally the supervisor of the person being grieved. 1 <i>id.,</i> at 150.</p>\n<p>If the inmate is dissatisfied with the Step I response, he may appeal to Step II by obtaining an appeal form within five business days of the response, and submitting the appeal within five business days of obtaining the form. <i>Id.,</i> at 152. The respondent at Step II is designated by the policy, <i>id.,</i> at 152-153 (<i>e.g.,</i> the regional health administrator for medical care grievances). If still dissatisfied after Step II, the inmate may further appeal to Step III using the same appeal form; the MDOC director is designated as respondent for all Step III appeals. <i>Id.,</i> at 154.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Lorenzo Jones</i></h2>\n<p>Petitioner Lorenzo Jones is incarcerated at the MDOC's Saginaw Correctional Facility. In November 2000, while in MDOC's custody, Jones was involved in a vehicle accident and suffered significant injuries to his neck and back. Several months later Jones was given a work assignment he allegedly could not perform in light of his injuries. According to Jones, respondent Paul Morrisonin charge of work assignments at the prisonmade the inappropriate assignment, even though he knew of Jones's injuries. When Jones reported to the assignment, he informed the staff member in chargerespondent Michael Opanasenkothat he could not perform <span class=\"star-pagination\">*917</span> the work; Opanasenko allegedly told him to do the work or \"`suffer the consequences.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 20. Jones performed the required tasks and allegedly aggravated his injuries. After unsuccessfully seeking redress through the MDOC's grievance process, Jones filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for deliberate indifference to medical needs, retaliation, and harassment. Jones named as defendants, in addition to Morrison and Opanasenko, respondents Barbara Bock (the warden), Valerie Chaplin (a deputy warden), Janet Konkle (a registered nurse), and Ahmad Aldabaugh (a physician).</p>\n<p>A Magistrate recommended dismissal for failure to state a claim with respect to Bock, Chaplin, Konkle, and Aldabaugh, and the District Court agreed. 1 App. 41. With respect to Morrison and Opanasenko, however, the Magistrate recommended that the suit proceed, finding that Jones had exhausted his administrative remedies as to those two. <i>Id.,</i> at 18-29. The District Court disagreed. In his complaint, Jones provided the dates on which his claims were filed at various steps of the MDOC grievance procedures. <i>Id.,</i> at 41. He did not, however, attach copies of the grievance forms or describe the proceedings with specificity. Respondents attached copies of all of Jones's grievances to their own motion to dismiss, but the District Judge ruled that Jones's failure to meet his burden to plead exhaustion in his complaint could not be cured by respondents. <i>Id.,</i> at 42. The Sixth Circuit agreed, holding both that Jones failed to comply with the specific pleading requirements applied to PLRA suits, 135 Fed. Appx. 837, 839 (2005) <i>(per curiam)</i> (citing <i>Knuckles El,</i> 215 F.3d, at 642), and that, even if Jones had shown that he exhausted the claims against Morrison and Opanasenko, dismissal was still required under the total exhaustion rule, 135 Fed.Appx., at 839 (citing <i>Jones Bey,</i> 407 F.3d, at 806).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Timothy Williams</i></h2>\n<p>Petitioner Timothy Williams is incarcerated at the MDOC's Adrian Correctional Facility. He suffers from noninvoluting cavernous hemangiomas in his right arm, a medical condition that causes pain, immobility, and disfigurement of the limb, and for which he has undergone several surgeries. An MDOC physician recommended further surgery to provide pain relief, but MDOC's Correctional Medical Services denied the recommendation (and subsequent appeals by the doctor) on the ground that the danger of surgery outweighed the benefits, which it viewed as cosmetic. The MDOC Medical Services Advisory Committee upheld this decision. After Correctional Medical Services indicated that it would take the request under advisement, Williams filed a grievance objecting to the quality of his medical care and seeking authorization for the surgery. He later filed another grievance complaining that he was denied a single-occupancy handicapped cell, allegedly necessary to accommodate his medical condition. After both grievances were denied at all stages, Williams filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Michigan under § 1983, naming as respondents William Overton (former director of MDOC), David Jamrog (the warden), Mary Jo Pass and Paul Klee (assistant deputy wardens), Chad Markwell (corrections officer), Bonnie Peterson (health unit manager), and Dr. George Pramstaller (chief medical officer for MDOC).</p>\n<p>The District Judge found that Williams had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to his medical care claim because he had not identified any of the respondents named in his lawsuit during <span class=\"star-pagination\">*918</span> the grievance process.<sup>[5]</sup> Although Williams's claim concerning the handicapped cell had been properly exhausted, the District Judgeapplying the total exhaustion ruledismissed the entire suit. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. 136 Fed. Appx. 859, 861-863 (2005) (citing <i>Burton,</i> 321 F.3d, at 574, <i>Curry v. Scott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773143\"><a href=\"/opinion/773143/greg-curry-v-david-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span>, 504-505 (C.A.6 2001), and <i>Jones Bey,</i> 407 F.3d, at 805).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>John Walton</i></h2>\n<p>Petitioner John Walton is incarcerated at the MDOC's Alger Maximum Correctional Facility. After assaulting a guard, he was sanctioned with an indefinite \"upper slot\" restriction.<sup>[6]</sup> Several months later, upon learning that other prisoners had been given upper slot restrictions of only three months for the same infraction, he filed a grievance claiming that this disparity was the result of racial discrimination (Walton is black, the two other prisoners he identified in his grievances are white). After the grievance was denied, Walton filed a complaint in the Western District of Michigan under § 1983, claiming race discrimination. He named as respondents Barbara Bouchard (former warden), Ken Gearin, David Bergh, and Ron Bobo (assistant deputy wardens), Catherine Bauman (resident unit manager), and Denise Gerth (assistant resident unit supervisor).</p>\n<p>The District Judge dismissed the lawsuit because Walton had not named any respondent other than Bobo in his grievance. His claims against the other respondents were thus not properly exhausted, and the court dismissed the entire action under the total exhaustion rule. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, reiterating its requirement that a prisoner must \"file a grievance against the person he ultimately seeks to sue,\" <i>Curry, supra,</i> at 505, and that this requirement can only be satisfied by naming each defendant at Step I of the MDOC grievance process. Because Walton had exhausted prison remedies only as to respondent Bobo, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the entire action. 136 Fed.Appx. 846, 848-849 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Jones sought review in a petition for certiorari, arguing that the Sixth Circuit's heightened pleading requirement and total exhaustion rule contravene the clear language of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the PLRA. Williams and Walton filed a joint petition under this Court's Rule 12.4, contending that the rule requiring every defendant to be named during the grievance process is not required by the PLRA, and also challenging the total exhaustion rule. We granted both petitions for certiorari, 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 246 (2006), and consolidated the cases for our review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*919</span> that unexhausted claims cannot be brought in court. <i>Porter,</i> 534 U.S., at 524, 122 S.Ct. 983. What is less clear is whether it falls to the prisoner to plead and demonstrate exhaustion in the complaint, or to the defendant to raise lack of exhaustion as an affirmative defense. The minority rule, adopted by the Sixth Circuit, places the burden of pleading exhaustion in a case covered by the PLRA on the prisoner; most courts view failure to exhaust as an affirmative defense. See n. 2, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>We think petitioners, and the majority of courts to consider the question, have the better of the argument. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires simply a \"short and plain statement of the claim\" in a complaint, while Rule 8(c) identifies a nonexhaustive list of affirmative defenses that must be pleaded in response. The PLRA itself is not a source of a prisoner's claim; claims covered by the PLRA are typically brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which does not require exhaustion at all, see <i>Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110753\"><a href=\"/opinion/110753/patsy-v-board-of-regents-of-fla/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, 516, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982). Petitioners assert that courts typically regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense in other contexts, see Brief for Petitioners 34-36, and nn. 12-13 (citing cases), and respondents do not seriously dispute the general proposition. We have referred to exhaustion in these terms, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></span>, 75, 119 S.Ct. 391, 142 L.Ed.2d 361 (1998) (referring to \"failure to exhaust\" as an \"affirmative defens[e]\"), including in the similar statutory scheme governing habeas corpus, <i>Day v. McDonough,</i> 547 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 1675 (2006) (slip op., at 8) (referring to exhaustion as a \"defense\"). The PLRA dealt extensively with the subject of exhaustion, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 1997e(a), (c)(2), but is silent on the issue whether exhaustion must be pleaded by the plaintiff or is an affirmative defense. This is strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed, and the usual practice under the Federal Rules is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>In a series of recent cases, we have explained that courts should generally not depart from the usual practice under the Federal Rules on the basis of perceived policy concerns. Thus, in <i>Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112825\"><a href=\"/opinion/112825/leatherman-v-tarrant-county-narcotics-intelligence/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993), we unanimously reversed the court of appeals for imposing a heightened pleading standard in § 1983 suits against municipalities. We explained that \"[p]erhaps if [the] Rules. . . were rewritten today, claims against municipalities under § 1983 might be subjected to the added specificity requirement. . . . But that is a result which must be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 168, 113 S.Ct. 1160.</p>\n<p>In <i>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118482\"><a href=\"/opinion/118482/swierkiewicz-v-sorema-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002), we unanimously reversed the court of appeals for requiring employment discrimination plaintiffs to specifically allege the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination. We explained that \"the Federal Rules do not contain a heightened pleading standard for employment discrimination suits,\" and a \"requirement of greater specificity for particular claims\" must be obtained by amending the Federal Rules. <i>Id.,</i> at 515, 122 S.Ct. 992 (citing <i>Leatherman</i>). And just last Term, in <i>Hill v. McDonough,</i> 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44 (2006), we unanimously rejected a proposal that § 1983 suits challenging a method of execution must identify an acceptable alternative: \"Specific pleading requirements are mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and not, as a general rule, through case-by-case determinations of the federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*920</span> courts.\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2096 (slip op., at 8) (citing <i>Swierkiewicz</i>).</p>\n<p>The Sixth Circuit and other courts requiring prisoners to plead and demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints contend that if the \"new regime\" mandated by the PLRA for prisoner complaints is to function effectively, prisoner complaints must be treated outside of this typical framework. See <i>Baxter,</i> 305 F.3d, at 489. These courts explain that the PLRA not only imposed a new mandatory exhaustion requirement, but also departed in a fundamental way from the usual procedural ground rules by requiring judicial screening to filter out nonmeritorious claims: Courts are to screen inmate complaints \"before docketing, if feasible, or . . . as soon as practicable after docketing,\" and dismiss the complaint if it is \"frivolous, malicious, . . . fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted[,] or . . . seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\" 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915A(a), (b). All this may take place before any responsive pleading is filed unlike in the typical civil case, defendants do not have to respond to a complaint covered by the PLRA until required to do so by the court, and waiving the right to reply does not constitute an admission of the allegations in the complaint. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(g)(1), (2). According to respondents, these departures from the normal litigation framework of complaint and response mandate a different pleading requirement for prisoner complaints, if the screening is to serve its intended purpose. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Baxter, supra,</i> at 489 (\"This court's heightened pleading standards for complaints covered by the PLRA are designed to facilitate the Act's screening requirements. . .\"); <i>Knuckles El,</i> 215 F.3d, at 642. See also Brief for Respondents 17.</p>\n<p>We think that the PLRA's screening requirement does notexplicitly or implicitlyjustify deviating from the usual procedural practice beyond the departures specified by the PLRA itself. Before the PLRA, the <i>in forma pauperis</i> provision of § 1915, applicable to most prisoner litigation, permitted <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal only if an action was frivolous or malicious. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) (1994 ed.); see also <i>Neitzke,</i> 490 U.S., at 320, 109 S.Ct. 1827 (concluding that a complaint that fails to state a claim was not frivolous under § 1915(d) and thus could not be dismissed <i>sua sponte</i>). In the PLRA, Congress added failure to state a claim and seeking monetary relief from a defendant immune from such relief as grounds for <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal of <i>in forma pauperis</i> cases, § 1915(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.), and provided for judicial screening and <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal of prisoner suits on the same four grounds, § 1915A(b); 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(c)(1). Although exhaustion was a \"centerpiece\" of the PLRA, <i>Woodford,</i> 548 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 1-2), failure to exhaust was notably not added in terms to this enumeration. There is thus no reason to suppose that the normal pleading rules have to be altered to facilitate judicial screening of complaints specifically for failure to exhaust.</p>\n<p>Some courts have found that exhaustion is subsumed under the PLRA's enumerated ground authorizing early dismissal for \"fail[ure] to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\" 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915A(b)(1), 1915(e)(2)(B); 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(c)(1). See <i>Baxter, supra,</i> at 489; <i>Steele v. Federal Bureau of Prisons,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"164185\"><a href=\"/opinion/164185/steele-v-federal-bureau-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></a></span>, 1210 (C.A.10 2003); <i>Rivera v. Allin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72929\"><a href=\"/opinion/72929/rivera-v-allin/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, 731 (C.A.11 1998). The point is a bit of a red herring. A complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim if the allegations, taken as true, show the plaintiff is not entitled to relief. If the allegations, for example, show that relief is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, the complaint is subject <span class=\"star-pagination\">*921</span> to dismissal for failure to state a claim; that does not make the statute of limitations any less an affirmative defense, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). Whether a particular ground for opposing a claim may be the basis for dismissal for failure to state a claim depends on whether the allegations in the complaint suffice to establish that ground, not on the nature of the ground in the abstract. See <i>Leveto v. Lapina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774140\"><a href=\"/opinion/774140/daniel-j-leveto-margaret-a-leveto-v-robert-a-lapin/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, 161 (C.A.3 2001) (\"[A] complaint may be subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) when an affirmative defense ... appears on its face\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

See also 5B C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1357, pp. 708-710, 721-729 (3d ed.2004). Determining that Congress meant to include failure to exhaust under the rubric of \"failure to state a claim\" in the screening provisions of the PLRA would thus not support treating exhaustion as a pleading requirement rather than an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>The argument that screening would be more effective if exhaustion had to be shown in the complaint proves too much; the same could be said with respect to any affirmative defense. The rejoinder that the PLRA focused on exhaustion rather than other defenses simply highlights the failure of Congress to include exhaustion in terms among the enumerated grounds justifying dismissal upon early screening. As noted, that is not to say that failure to exhaust cannot be a basis for dismissal for failure to state a claim. It is to say that there is no basis for concluding that Congress implicitly meant to transform exhaustion from an affirmative defense to a pleading requirement by the curiously indirect route of specifying that courts should screen PLRA complaints and dismiss those that fail to state a claim.</p>\n<p>Respondents point to 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(g) as confirming that the usual pleading rules should not apply to PLRA suits, but we think that provision supports petitioners. It specifies that defendants can waive their right to reply to a prisoner complaint without the usual consequence of being deemed to have admitted the allegations in the complaint. See § 1997e(g)(1) (allowing defendants to waive their response without admitting the allegations \"[n]otwithstanding any other law or rule of procedure\"). This shows that when Congress meant to depart from the usual procedural requirements, it did so expressly.</p>\n<p>We conclude that failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints. We understand the reasons behind the decisions of some lower courts to impose a pleading requirement on plaintiffs in this context, but that effort cannot fairly be viewed as an interpretation of the PLRA. \"Whatever temptations the statesmanship of policy-making might wisely suggest,\" the judge's job is to construe the statutenot to make it better. Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L.Rev. 527, 533 (1947). The judge \"must not read in by way of creation,\" but instead abide by the \"duty of restraint, th[e] humility of function as merely the translator of another's command.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 533-534. See <i>United States v. Goldenberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94747\"><a href=\"/opinion/94747/united-states-v-goldenberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 103, 18 S.Ct. 3, 42 L.Ed. 394 (1897) (\"No mere omission ... which it may seem wise to have specifically provided for, justif[ies] any judicial addition to the language of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*922</span> statute\"). Given that the PLRA does not itself require plaintiffs to plead exhaustion, such a result \"must be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.\" <i>Leatherman,</i> 507 U.S., at 168, 113 S.Ct. 1160.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Sixth Circuit threw out the Williams and Walton suits because those prisoners had not identified in their initial grievances each defendant they later sued. 136 Fed.Appx., at 862-863; <i>id.,</i> at 848-849. See <i>Burton,</i> 321 F.3d, at 575.<sup>[7]</sup> Here again the lower court's procedural rule lacks a textual basis in the PLRA. The PLRA requires exhaustion of \"such administrative remedies as are available,\" 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), but nothing in the statute imposes a \"name all defendants\" requirement along the lines of the Sixth Circuit's judicially created rule. Respondents argue that without such a rule the exhaustion requirement would become a \"`useless appendage,'\" Brief for Respondents 44 (quoting <i>Woodford,</i> 548 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 11)), but the assertion is hyperbole, and the citation of <i>Woodford</i> misplaced.</p>\n<p><i>Woodford</i> held that \"proper exhaustion\" was required under the PLRA, and that this requirement was not satisfied when grievances were dismissed because prisoners had missed deadlines set by the grievance policy. <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 11-13). At the time each of the grievances at issue here was filed, in contrast, the MDOC policy did not contain any provision specifying who must be named in a grievance. MDOC's policy required only that prisoners \"be as specific as possible\" in their grievances, 1 App. 148, while at the same time the required forms advised them to \"[b]e brief and concise.\" 2 <i>id.,</i> at 1. The MDOC grievance form does not require a prisoner to identify a particular responsible party, and the respondent is not necessarily the allegedly culpable prison official, but rather an administrative official designated in the policy to respond to particular types of grievances at different levels. <i>Supra,</i> at 6. The grievance policy specifically provides that the grievant at Step I \"shall have the opportunity to explain the grievance more completely at [an] interview, enabling the Step I respondent to gather any additional information needed to respond to the grievance.\" 1 App. 151. Nothing in the MDOC policy itself supports the conclusion that the grievance process was improperly invoked simply because an individual later named as a defendant was not named at the first step of the grievance process.</p>\n<p>Nor does the PLRA impose such a requirement. In <i>Woodford,</i> we held that to properly exhaust administrative remedies prisoners must \"complete the administrative review process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules,\" 548 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 5)rules that are defined not by the PLRA, but by the prison grievance process itself. Compliance with prison grievance procedures, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*923</span> therefore, is all that is required by the PLRA to \"properly exhaust.\" The level of detail necessary in a grievance to comply with the grievance procedures will vary from system to system and claim to claim, but it is the prison's requirements, and not the PLRA, that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion. As the MDOC's procedures make no mention of naming particular officials, the Sixth Circuit's rule imposing such a prerequisite to proper exhaustion is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>We have identified the benefits of exhaustion to include allowing a prison to address complaints about the program it administers before being subjected to suit, reducing litigation to the extent complaints are satisfactorily resolved, and improving litigation that does occur by leading to the preparation of a useful record. See <i>id.,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 6-8); <i>Porter,</i> 534 U.S., at 524-525, 122 S.Ct. 983. The Sixth Circuit rule may promote early notice to those who might later be sued, but that has not been thought to be one of the leading purposes of the exhaustion requirement. See <i>Johnson,</i> 385 F.3d, at 522 (\"We are mindful that the primary purpose of a grievance is to alert prison officials to a problem, not to provide personal notice to a particular official that he may be sued; the grievance is not a summons and complaint that initiates adversarial litigation\"); see also Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 8-9, and n. 6 (collecting grievance procedures and noting that the majority do not require prisoners to identify specific individuals).</p>\n<p>We do not determine whether the grievances filed by petitioners satisfied the requirement of \"proper exhaustion,\" <i>Woodford, supra,</i> at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 11), but simply conclude that exhaustion is not <i>per se</i> inadequate simply because an individual later sued was not named in the grievances. We leave it to the court below in the first instance to determine the sufficiency of the exhaustion in these cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The final issue concerns how courts should address complaints in which the prisoner has failed to exhaust some, but not all, of the claims asserted in the complaint.<sup>[8]</sup> All agree that no unexhausted claim may be considered. The issue is whether the court should proceed with the exhausted claims, or insteadas the Sixth Circuit has helddismiss the entire action if any one claim is not properly exhausted. See <i>Jones Bey,</i> 407 F.3d, at 807.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Here the Sixth Circuit can point to language in the PLRA in support of its rule. Section 1997e(a) provides that \"[n]o action shall be brought\" unless administrative procedures are exhausted. Respondents argue that if Congress intended courts to dismiss only unexhausted claims while retaining the balance of the lawsuit, the word <span class=\"star-pagination\">*924</span> \"claim\" rather than \"action\" would have been used in this provision.</p>\n<p>This statutory phrasing\"no action shall be brought\"is boilerplate language. There are many instances in the Federal Code where similar language is used, but such language has not been thought to lead to the dismissal of an entire action if a single claim fails to meet the pertinent standards. Statutes of limitations, for example, are often introduced by a variant of the phrase \"no action shall be brought,\" see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Beach v. Ocwen Fed. Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118197\"><a href=\"/opinion/118197/beach-v-ocwen-fed-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, 416, 118 S.Ct. 1408, 140 L.Ed.2d 566 (1998); 18 U.S.C. § 1030(g) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), but we have never heard of an entire complaint being thrown out simply because one of several discrete claims was barred by the statute of limitations, and it is hard to imagine what purpose such a rule would serve. The same is true with respect to other uses of the \"no action shall be brought\" phrasing. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Hawksbill Sea Turtle v. Federal Emergency Management Agency,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746871\"><a href=\"/opinion/746871/hawksbill-sea-turtle-green-sea-turtle-chelonia-myd/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 471 (C.A.3 1997) (dismissing only claims that fail to comply with the citizen suit notification requirement of 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(2), which states that \"[n]o action may be commenced\" until an agency has declined to act after being given written notice).</p>\n<p>More generally, statutory references to an \"action\" have not typically been read to mean that every claim included in the action must meet the pertinent requirement before the \"action\" may proceed. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799986\"><a href=\"/opinion/799986/exxon-mobil-corp-v-allapattah-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 560-563, 125 S.Ct. 2611, 162 L.Ed.2d 502 (2005) (District Court had jurisdiction over a \"civil action\" under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), even if it might not have jurisdiction over each separate claim comprising the action); <i>Chicago v.

If Congress meant to depart from this norm, we would expect some indication of that, and we find none.\" <i>Robinson v. Page,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762451\"><a href=\"/opinion/762451/floyd-robinson-v-thomas-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span>, 748-749 (C.A.7 1999) (considering § 1997e(e)).</p>\n<p>Respondents note an exception to this general rule, the total exhaustion rule in habeas corpus. In <i>Rose v. Lundy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110662\"><a href=\"/opinion/110662/rose-v-lundy/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>, 522, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982), we held that \"mixed\" habeas petitionscontaining both exhausted and unexhausted claimscannot be adjudicated. This total exhaustion rule applied in habeas was initially derived from considerations of \"comity and federalism,\" not any statutory command. <i>Rhines v. Weber,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142884\"><a href=\"/opinion/142884/rhines-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 273, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005); <i>id.,</i> at 274, 125 S.Ct. 1528 (noting that Congress \"preserved <i>Lundy's</i> total exhaustion requirement\" in 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A)). Separate claims in a single habeas petition generally seek the same relief from custody, and success on one is often as good as success on another. In such a case it makes sense to require exhaustion of all claims in state court before allowing the federal action to proceed. A typical PLRA suit with multiple claims, on the other hand, may combine a wide variety of discrete complaints, about interactions with guards, prison conditions, generally applicable rules, and so on, seeking different relief on each claim. There is no reason failure to exhaust on one necessarily affects any other. In any event, even if the habeas total exhaustion rule is pertinent, it does not in fact depart from the usual practiceas we recently held, a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*925</span> court presented with a mixed habeas petition \"should allow the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims ....\" <i>Rhines, supra,</i> at 278, 125 S.Ct. 1528. This is the opposite of the rule the Sixth Circuit adopted, and precisely the rule that respondents argue against.</p>\n<p>Respondents' reading of 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) to contain a total exhaustion rule is bolstered by the fact that other sections of the PLRA distinguish between actions and claims. Section 1997e(c)(1), for example, provides that a court shall dismiss an <i>action</i> for one of four enumerated deficiencies, while § 1997e(c)(2) allows a court to dismiss a <i>claim</i> for one of these reasons without first determining whether the claim is exhausted. Similarly, 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b) directs district courts to dismiss \"the complaint, or any portion of the complaint\" before docketing under certain circumstances. This demonstrates that Congress knew how to differentiate between the entire action and particular claims when it wanted to, and suggests that its use of \"action\" rather than \"claim\" in 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) should be given effect.</p>\n<p>But the interpretation respondents advocate creates its own inconsistencies. Section 1997e(e) contains similar language, \"[n]o ... action may be brought ... for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury,\" yet respondents cite no case interpreting this provision to require dismissal of the entire lawsuit if only one claim does not comply, and again we see little reason for such an approach. Accord, <i>Cassidy v. Indiana Dept. of Corrections,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767120\"><a href=\"/opinion/767120/richard-cassidy-v-indiana-department-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 376-377 (C.A.7 2000) (dismissing only the portions of the complaint barred by § 1997e(e)); see also <i>Williams v. Ollis,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1361</span></span> (C.A.6 2000) (unpublished table decision) (same). Interpreting the phrase \"no action shall be brought\" to require dismissal of the entire case under § 1997e(a) but not § 1997e(e) would contravene our normal rules of statutory construction. <i>National Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118174\"><a href=\"/opinion/118174/national-credit-union-admin-v-first-nat-bank-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 501-502, 118 S.Ct. 927, 140 L.Ed.2d 1 (1998).</p>\n<p>In pressing the total exhaustion argument, respondents also marshal the policy and purpose underlying the PLRAthis time in a supporting rather than lead role. The invigorated exhaustion requirement is a \"centerpiece\" of the statute, <i>Woodford,</i> 548 U.S., at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (slip op., at 1-2), and if the exhaustion requirement of § 1997e(a) is not effectuated by a total exhaustion rule, they argue, inmates will have little incentive to ensure that they have exhausted all available administrative remedies before proceeding to court. The PLRA mandated early judicial screening to reduce the burden of prisoner litigation on the courts; a total exhaustion rule allows courts promptly to dismiss an action upon identifying an unexhausted claim. The alternative approach turns judges into editors of prisoner complaints, rather than creating an incentive for prisoners to exhaust properly. See <i>Ross v. County of Bernalillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"164588\"><a href=\"/opinion/164588/ross-v-mckinley-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span>, 1190 (C.A.10 2004).</p>\n<p>We are not persuaded by these policy arguments. In fact, the effect of a total exhaustion rule could be that inmates will file various claims in separate suits, to avoid the possibility of an unexhausted claim tainting the others. That would certainly not comport with the purpose of the PLRA to reduce the quantity of inmate suits. Additionally, district judges who delve into a prisoner complaint only to realize it contains an unexhausted claim, requiring dismissal of the entire complaint under the total exhaustion rule, will often have to begin the process all over again <span class=\"star-pagination\">*926</span> when the prisoner refiles. In light of typically short prison grievance time limits, prisoners' refiled complaints will often be identical to what the district court would have considered had it simply dismissed unexhausted claims as it encountered them and proceeded with the exhausted ones. Perhaps filing fees and concerns about the applicability of the \"three strikes\" rule, 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g), would mitigate these effects, but the debate about consequences is close enough that there is no clear reason to depart from the more typical claim-by-claim approach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We are not insensitive to the challenges faced by the lower federal courts in managing their dockets and attempting to separate, when it comes to prisoner suits, not so much wheat from chaff as needles from haystacks. We once again reiterate, howeveras we did unanimously in <i>Leatherman, Swierkiewicz,</i> and <i>Hill</i>that adopting different and more onerous pleading rules to deal with particular categories of cases should be done through established rulemaking procedures, and not on a case-by-case basis by the courts.</p>\n<p>The judgments of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit are reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  See Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Judicial Facts and Figures, Tables 4.4, 4.6, http://www.uscourts.gov/ judicialfactsfigures/contents.html (as visited Jan. 17, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).

See Policy Directive 03.02.130 (effective Dec. 19, 2003), App. to Brief for Respondents 1b. The new policy is not at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p>[5]  Dr. Pramstaller was mentioned at Step III of the grievance process, but was apparently never served with the complaint initiating the lawsuit. The Magistrate stated that even if the claims against Pramstaller had been properly exhausted they nonetheless were subject to dismissal under the total exhaustion rule. 1 App. 86, 101. It also appears that under the Sixth Circuit's rule requiring a defendant to be named at Step I of the grievance process, the claims against Pramstaller, who was not mentioned until Step III, would not have been exhausted. See <i>supra,</i> at 4; n. 7, <i>infra.</i> Because Pramstaller was never served, he is not a respondent in this Court.</p>\n<p>[6]  An upper slot restriction limits the inmate to receiving food and paperwork via the lower slot of the cell door. Brief for Respondents 5-6. Presumably, this is less desirable than access through the upper slot; the record does not reveal how effective this particular sanction is in discouraging assaults on staff.</p>\n<p>[7]  This \"name all defendants\" rule apparently applies even when a prisoner does not learn the identity of the responsible party until a later step of the grievance process. Upon learning the identity of the responsible party, the prisoner is required to bring an entirely new grievance to properly exhaust. 136 Fed. Appx. 846, 849 (C.A.6 2005) (\"At that point [after he learned, in response to a Step I grievance, that Gearin was responsible for the upper slot restriction], Walton was armed with all of the information that he needed to file a Step I grievance against ... Gearin and a federal complaint against Gearin once the claim had been exhaustedbut he simply chose not to follow this route\"). At oral argument, Michigan admitted that it did not agree with at least this application of the rule. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44-45.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although we reverse the Sixth Circuit's rulings on the substantive exhaustion requirements as to all three petitioners, the question whether a total exhaustion rule is contemplated by the PLRA is not moot. In Jones's case, the Sixth Circuit ruled in the alternative that total exhaustion required dismissal. 135 Fed. Appx. 837, 839 (C.A.6 2005) <i>(per curiam)</i> (\"[E]ven if Jones had shown he had exhausted some of his claims, the district court properly dismissed the complaint because Jones did not show that he had exhausted all of his claims\").</p>\n<p>[9]  After we granted certiorari, the Sixth Circuit suggested that the adoption of a total exhaustion rule in that Circuit in <i>Jones Bey</i> ran contrary to previous panel decisions and was therefore not controlling. <i>Spencer v.

Argued October 30, 2006—Decided January 22, 2007*\nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), in order to address\n  the large number of prisoner complaints filed in federal court, man\n  dates early judicial screening of prisoner complaints and requires\n  prisoners to exhaust prison grievance procedures before filing suit.\n  42 U. S. C. §1997e(a). Petitioners, inmates in Michigan prisons, filed\n  grievances using the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC)\n  grievance process. After unsuccessfully seeking redress through that\n  process, petitioner Jones filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983 suit against six\n  prison officials. The District Court dismissed on the merits as to four\n  of them and as to two others found that Jones had failed to ade\n  quately plead exhaustion in his complaint. Petitioner Williams also\n  filed a §1983 suit after his two MDOC grievances were denied. The\n  District Court found that he had not exhausted his administrative\n  remedies with regard to one of the grievances because he had not\n  identified any of the respondents named in the lawsuit during the\n  grievance process. While the court found Williams’s other claim\n  properly exhausted, it dismissed the entire suit under the Sixth Cir\n  cuit’s total exhaustion rule for PLRA cases. Petitioner Walton’s\n  §1983 lawsuit also was dismissed under the total exhaustion rule be\n  cause his MDOC grievance named only one of the six defendants in\n  his lawsuit. The Sixth Circuit affirmed in each case, relying on its\n  procedural rules that require a prisoner to allege and demonstrate\n  exhaustion in his complaint, permit suit only against defendants\n  identified in the prisoner’s grievance, and require courts to dismiss\n——————\n  * Together with No. 05–7142, Williams v.

BOCK\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    the entire action if the prisoner fails to satisfy the exhaustion re\n    quirement as to any single claim in his complaint.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit’s rules are not required by the PLRA, and craft\n ing and imposing such rules exceeds the proper limits of the judicial\n role. Pp. 10–24.\n    (a) Failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA,\n and inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate ex\n haustion in their complaints. There is no question that exhaustion is\n mandatory under the PLRA, Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 524, but\n it is less clear whether the prisoner must plead and demonstrate ex\n haustion in the complaint or the defendant must raise lack of exhaus\n tion as an affirmative defense. Failure to exhaust is better viewed as\n an affirmative defense. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires\n simply a “short and plain statement of the claim” in a complaint, and\n PLRA claims are typically brought under 42 U. S. C. §1983, which\n does not require exhaustion at all. The fact that the PLRA dealt ex\n tensively with exhaustion, but is silent on the issue whether exhaus\n tion must be pleaded or is an affirmative defense, is strong evidence\n that the usual practice should be followed, and the practice under the\n Federal Rules is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense, in\n cluding in the similar statutory scheme governing habeas corpus,\n Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. ___, ___. Courts should generally not\n depart from the Federal Rules’ usual practice based on perceived pol\n icy concerns. See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics In\n telligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163 Those courts that re\n quire prisoners to plead and demonstrate exhaustion contend that\n prisoner complaints must be treated outside of the typical framework\n if the PLRA’s screening requirement is to function effectively. But\n the screening requirement does not—explicitly or implicitly—justify\n deviating from the usual procedural practice beyond the departures\n specified by the PLRA itself. Although exhaustion was a “center\n piece” of the PLRA, Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. ___, ___, failure to ex\n haust was notably not added in terms to the enumerated grounds\n justifying dismissal upon early screening. Section1997e(g)—which\n allows defendants to waive their right to reply to a prisoner com\n plaint without being deemed to have admitted the complaint’s allega\n tions—shows that when Congress meant to depart from the usual\n procedural requirements, it did so expressly. Given that the PLRA\n does not itself require plaintiffs to plead exhaustion, such a result\n “must be obtained by . . . amending the Federal Rules, and not by ju\n dicial interpretation.” Leatherman, supra, at 168. Pp. 10–16.\n    (b) Exhaustion is not per se inadequate under the PLRA when an\n individual later sued was not named in the grievance. Nothing in the\n MDOC policy supports the conclusion that the grievance process was\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  improperly invoked because an individual later named as a defen\n  dant was not named at the first step of the process; at the time each\n  grievance was filed here, the MDOC policy did not specifically require\n  a prisoner to name anyone in the grievance. Nor does the PLRA im\n  pose such a requirement. The “applicable procedural rules” that a\n  prisoner must properly exhaust, Woodford, supra, at ___, are defined\n  not by the PLRA, but by the prison grievance process itself. As the\n  MDOC’s procedures make no mention of naming particular officials,\n  the Sixth Circuit’s rule imposing such a prerequisite to proper ex\n  haustion is unwarranted. The Circuit’s rule may promote early no\n  tice to those who might later be sued, but that has not been thought\n  to be one of the leading purposes of the exhaustion requirement. The\n  court below should determine in the first instance whether petition\n  ers’ grievances otherwise satisfied the exhaustion requirement.\n  Pp. 16–19.\n     (c) The PLRA does not require dismissal of the entire complaint\n  when a prisoner has failed to exhaust some, but not all, of the claims\n  included in the complaint. Respondents argue that had Congress in\n  tended courts to dismiss only unexhausted claims while retaining the\n  balance of the lawsuit, it would have used the word “claim” instead of\n  “action” in §1997e(a), which provides that “[n]o action shall be\n  brought” unless administrative procedures are exhausted. That boi\n  lerplate language is used in many instances in the Federal Code, and\n  statutory references to an “action” have not typically been read to\n  mean that every claim included in the action must meet the pertinent\n  requirement before the “action” may proceed. If a complaint contains\n  both good and bad claims, the court proceeds with the good and\n  leaves the bad. Respondents note that the total exhaustion require\n  ment in habeas corpus is an exception to this general rule, but a\n  court presented with a mixed habeas petition typically “allow[s] the\n  petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the\n  exhausted claims,” Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269, 278, which is the\n  opposite of the rule the Sixth Circuit adopted, and precisely the rule\n  that respondents argue against. Although other PLRA sections dis\n  tinguish between actions and claims, respondents’ reading of\n  §1997e(a) creates its own inconsistencies, and their policy arguments\n  are also unpersuasive.

S. C. §1997e et seq. Among\nother reforms, the PLRA mandates early judicial screen\ning of prisoner complaints and requires prisoners to ex\nhaust prison grievance procedures before filing suit. 28\nU. S. C. §1915A; 42 U. S. C. §1997e(a). The Sixth Circuit,\nalong with some other lower courts, adopted several pro\ncedural rules designed to implement this exhaustion\nrequirement and facilitate early judicial screening. These\nrules require a prisoner to allege and demonstrate exhaus\n2                          JONES v. BOCK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntion in his complaint, permit suit only against defendants\nwho were identified by the prisoner in his grievance, and\nrequire courts to dismiss the entire action if the prisoner\nfails to satisfy the exhaustion requirement as to any single\nclaim in his complaint. Other lower courts declined to\nadopt such rules. We granted certiorari to resolve the\nconflict and now conclude that these rules are not required\nby the PLRA, and that crafting and imposing them ex\nceeds the proper limits on the judicial role.\n                               I\n  Prisoner litigation continues to “account for an outsized\nshare of filings” in federal district courts. Woodford v.\nNgo, 548 U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2006) (slip op., at 12, n. 4). In\n2005, nearly 10 percent of all civil cases filed in federal\ncourts nationwide were prisoner complaints challenging\nprison conditions or claiming civil rights violations.1 Most\nof these cases have no merit; many are frivolous. Our\nlegal system, however, remains committed to guarantee\ning that prisoner claims of illegal conduct by their custodi\nans are fairly handled according to law. The challenge lies\nin ensuring that the flood of nonmeritorious claims does\nnot submerge and effectively preclude consideration of the\nallegations with merit. See Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U. S.\n319, 327 (1989).\n  Congress addressed that challenge in the PLRA. What\nthis country needs, Congress decided, is fewer and better\nprisoner suits. See Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 524\n(2002) (PLRA intended to “reduce the quantity and im\nprove the quality of prisoner suits”). To that end, Con\n——————\n  1 See Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Judicial\n\nFacts and Figures, Tables 4.4, 4.6, http://www.uscourts.gov/\njudicialfactsfigures/contents.html (as visited Jan. 17, 2007, and avail\nable in Clerk of Court’s case file). That number excludes habeas corpus\npetitions and motions to vacate a sentence. If these filing are included,\nprisoner complaints constituted 24 percent of all civil filings in 2005.\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ngress enacted a variety of reforms designed to filter out\nthe bad claims and facilitate consideration of the good.\nKey among these was the requirement that inmates com\nplaining about prison conditions exhaust prison grievance\nremedies before initiating a lawsuit.\n  The exhaustion provision of the PLRA states:\n     “No action shall be brought with respect to prison con\n     ditions under [42 U. S. C. §1983], or any other Federal\n     law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other\n     correctional facility until such administrative reme\n     dies as are available are exhausted.” 42 U. S. C.\n     §1997e(a).\nRequiring exhaustion allows prison officials an opportu\nnity to resolve disputes concerning the exercise of their\nresponsibilities before being haled into court. This has the\npotential to reduce the number of inmate suits, and also to\nimprove the quality of suits that are filed by producing a\nuseful administrative record. Woodford, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 12). In an attempt to implement the exhaustion\nrequirement, some lower courts have imposed procedural\nrules that have become the subject of varying levels of\ndisagreement among the federal courts of appeals.\n  The first question presented centers on a conflict over\nwhether exhaustion under the PLRA is a pleading re\nquirement the prisoner must satisfy in his complaint or an\naffirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove.2\n——————\n  2 Compare Steele v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 355 F. 3d 1204, 1210\n\n(CA10 2003) (pleading requirement); Brown v. Toombs, 139 F. 3d 1102,\n1104 (CA6 1998) (per curiam) (same); Rivera v.

BOCK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Sixth Circuit, adopting the former view, requires\nprisoners to attach proof of exhaustion—typically copies of\nthe grievances—to their complaints to avoid dismissal. If\nno written record of the grievance is available, the inmate\nmust plead with specificity how and when he exhausted\nthe grievance procedures. Knuckles El v. Toombs, 215\nF. 3d 640, 642 (2000).\n   The next issue concerns how courts determine whether\na prisoner has properly exhausted administrative reme\ndies—specifically, the level of detail required in a griev\nance to put the prison and individual officials on notice of\nthe claim. The Sixth Circuit requires that a prisoner have\nidentified, in the first step of the grievance process, each\nindividual later named in the lawsuit to properly exhaust\nadministrative remedies. Burton v. Jones, 321 F. 3d 569,\n575 (2003). Other circuits have taken varying approaches\nto this question, see, e.g., Butler v. Adams, 397 F. 3d 1181,\n1183 (CA9 2005) (proper exhaustion requires use of the\nadministrative process provided by the State; if that proc\ness does not require identification of specific persons,\nneither does the PLRA); Johnson v. Johnson, 385 F. 3d\n503, 522 (CA5 2004) (“[T]he grievance must provide ad\nministrators with a fair opportunity under the circum\nstances to address the problem that will later form the\nbasis of the suit”); Riccardo v. Rausch, 375 F. 3d 521, 524\n(CA7 2004) (exhaustion satisfied if grievance “served its\nfunction of alerting the state and inviting corrective ac\ntion”), none going as far as the Sixth Circuit in requiring\nin every case that the defendants have been named from\nthe beginning of the grievance process.\n   Finally, the circuits are divided over what the PLRA\n\n——————\nalso Johnson v.

See, e.g., Jones Bey v.\nJohnson, 407 F. 3d 801, 805 (CA6 2005). Among circuits\nrequiring total exhaustion there is further disagreement\nover what to do if the requirement is not met. Most courts\nallow the prisoner to amend his complaint to include only\nexhausted claims, e.g., Kozohorsky v. Harmon, 332 F. 3d\n1141, 1144 (CA8 2003), but the Sixth Circuit denies leave\nto amend, dismisses the action, and requires that it be\nfiled anew with only unexhausted claims, Baxter v. Rose,\n305 F. 3d 486, 488 (2002); Jones Bey, supra, at 807. See\nalso McGore v. Wrigglesworth, 114 F. 3d 601, 612 (1997).\nOther circuits reject total exhaustion altogether, instead\ndismissing only unexhausted claims and considering the\nrest on the merits. See, e.g., Ortiz v.

Id., at 147. If oral resolution is unsuccessful,\nthe inmate may proceed to Step I of the grievance process,\nand submit a completed grievance form within five busi\nness days of the attempted oral resolution. Id., at 147,\n149–150. The Step I grievance form provided by MDOC (a\none-page form on which the inmate fills out identifying\ninformation and is given space to describe the complaint)\nadvises inmates to be “brief and concise in describing your\ngrievance issue.” 2 id., at 1. The inmate submits the\ngrievance to a designated grievance coordinator, who\nassigns it to a respondent—generally the supervisor of the\nperson being grieved. 1 id., at 150.\n   If the inmate is dissatisfied with the Step I response, he\nmay appeal to Step II by obtaining an appeal form within\nfive business days of the response, and submitting the\nappeal within five business days of obtaining the form.\nId., at 152. The respondent at Step II is designated by the\npolicy, id., at 152–153 (e.g., the regional health adminis\ntrator for medical care grievances). If still dissatisfied\nafter Step II, the inmate may further appeal to Step III\nusing the same appeal form; the MDOC director is desig\nnated as respondent for all Step III appeals.

Jones performed the re\nquired tasks and allegedly aggravated his injuries. After\nunsuccessfully seeking redress through the MDOC’s\ngrievance process, Jones filed a complaint in the Eastern\nDistrict of Michigan under 42 U. S.

With\nrespect to Morrison and Opanasenko, however, the Magis\ntrate recommended that the suit proceed, finding that\nJones had exhausted his administrative remedies as to\nthose two. Id., at 18–29. The District Court disagreed. In\nhis complaint, Jones provided the dates on which his\nclaims were filed at various steps of the MDOC grievance\nprocedures. Id., at 41. He did not, however, attach copies\nof the grievance forms or describe the proceedings with\nspecificity. Respondents attached copies of all of Jones’s\ngrievances to their own motion to dismiss, but the District\nJudge ruled that Jones’s failure to meet his burden to\nplead exhaustion in his complaint could not be cured by\nrespondents.

He suffers from\nnoninvoluting cavernous hemangiomas in his right arm, a\nmedical condition that causes pain, immobility, and dis\nfigurement of the limb, and for which he has undergone\nseveral surgeries. An MDOC physician recommended\nfurther surgery to provide pain relief, but MDOC’s Correc\ntional Medical Services denied the recommendation (and\nsubsequent appeals by the doctor) on the ground that the\ndanger of surgery outweighed the benefits, which it\nviewed as cosmetic. The MDOC Medical Services Advi\nsory Committee upheld this decision. After Correctional\nMedical Services indicated that it would take the request\nunder advisement, Williams filed a grievance objecting to\nthe quality of his medical care and seeking authorization\nfor the surgery. He later filed another grievance com\nplaining that he was denied a single-occupancy handi\ncapped cell, allegedly necessary to accommodate his medi\ncal condition. After both grievances were denied at all\nstages, Williams filed a complaint in the Eastern District\nof Michigan under §1983, naming as respondents William\nOverton (former director of MDOC), David Jamrog (the\nwarden), Mary Jo Pass and Paul Klee (assistant deputy\nwardens), Chad Markwell (corrections officer), Bonnie\nPeterson (health unit manager), and Dr. George Pram\nstaller (chief medical officer for MDOC).\n   The District Judge found that Williams had failed to\nexhaust his administrative remedies with regard to his\nmedical care claim because he had not identified any of\n                     Cite as: 549 U.

The Sixth Circuit affirmed. 136\nFed. Appx. 859, 861–863 (2005) (citing Burton, 321 F. 3d,\nat 574, Curry v. Scott, 249 F. 3d 493, 504–505 (CA6 2001),\nand Jones Bey, 407 F. 3d, at 805).\n                        John Walton\n   Petitioner John Walton is incarcerated at the MDOC’s\nAlger Maximum Correctional Facility. After assaulting a\nguard, he was sanctioned with an indefinite “upper slot”\nrestriction.6 Several months later, upon learning that\nother prisoners had been given upper slot restrictions of\nonly three months for the same infraction, he filed a griev\nance claiming that this disparity was the result of racial\ndiscrimination (Walton is black, the two other prisoners he\nidentified in his grievances are white). After the grievance\nwas denied, Walton filed a complaint in the Western\nDistrict of Michigan under §1983, claiming race discrimi\nnation. He named as respondents Barbara Bouchard\n(former warden), Ken Gearin, David Bergh, and Ron Bobo\n——————\n  5 Dr. Pramstaller was mentioned at Step III of the grievance process,\n\nbut was apparently never served with the complaint initiating the\nlawsuit. The Magistrate stated that even if the claims against Pram\nstaller had been properly exhausted they nonetheless were subject to\ndismissal under the total exhaustion rule. 1 App. 86, 101. It also\nappears that under the Sixth Circuit’s rule requiring a defendant to be\nnamed at Step I of the grievance process, the claims against Pram\nstaller, who was not mentioned until Step III, would not have been\nexhausted. See supra, at 4; n. 7, infra. Because Pramstaller was never\nserved, he is not a respondent in this Court.\n  6 An upper slot restriction limits the inmate to receiving food and\n\npaperwork via the lower slot of the cell door. Brief for Respondents 5–\n6. Presumably, this is less desirable than access through the upper\nslot; the record does not reveal how effective this particular sanction is\nin discouraging assaults on staff.\n10                    JONES v. BOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(assistant deputy wardens), Catherine Bauman (resident\nunit manager), and Denise Gerth (assistant resident unit\nsupervisor).\n  The District Judge dismissed the lawsuit because\nWalton had not named any respondent other than Bobo in\nhis grievance. His claims against the other respondents\nwere thus not properly exhausted, and the court dismissed\nthe entire action under the total exhaustion rule. The\nSixth Circuit affirmed, reiterating its requirement that a\nprisoner must “file a grievance against the person he\nultimately seeks to sue,” Curry, supra, at 505, and that\nthis requirement can only be satisfied by naming each\ndefendant at Step I of the MDOC grievance process.\nBecause Walton had exhausted prison remedies only as to\nrespondent Bobo, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt’s dismissal of the entire action. 136 Fed. Appx. 846,\n848–849 (2005).\n                             B\n   Jones sought review in a petition for certiorari, arguing\nthat the Sixth Circuit’s heightened pleading requirement\nand total exhaustion rule contravene the clear language of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the PLRA. Wil\nliams and Walton filed a joint petition under this Court’s\nRule 12.4, contending that the rule requiring every defen\ndant to be named during the grievance process is not\nrequired by the PLRA, and also challenging the total\nexhaustion rule. We granted both petitions for certiorari,\n547 U. S. ___ (2006), and consolidated the cases for our\nreview.\n                              II\n  There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory\nunder the PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be\nbrought in court. Porter, 534 U. S., at 524. What is less\nclear is whether it falls to the prisoner to plead and dem\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nonstrate exhaustion in the complaint, or to the defendant\nto raise lack of exhaustion as an affirmative defense. The\nminority rule, adopted by the Sixth Circuit, places the\nburden of pleading exhaustion in a case covered by the\nPLRA on the prisoner; most courts view failure to exhaust\nas an affirmative defense. See n. 2, supra.\n   We think petitioners, and the majority of courts to\nconsider the question, have the better of the argument.\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires simply a\n“short and plain statement of the claim” in a complaint,\nwhile Rule 8(c) identifies a nonexhaustive list of affirma\ntive defenses that must be pleaded in response. The PLRA\nitself is not a source of a prisoner’s claim; claims covered\nby the PLRA are typically brought under 42 U. S. C.\n§1983, which does not require exhaustion at all, see Patsy\nv. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 516 (1982).\nPetitioners assert that courts typically regard exhaustion\nas an affirmative defense in other contexts, see Brief for\nPetitioners 34–36, and nn. 12–13 (citing cases), and re\nspondents do not seriously dispute the general proposition.\nWe have referred to exhaustion in these terms, see, e.g.,\nWright v. Universal Maritime Service Corp., 525 U. S. 70,\n75 (1998) (referring to “failure to exhaust” as an “affirma\ntive defens[e]”), including in the similar statutory scheme\ngoverning habeas corpus, Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S.\n___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 8) (referring to exhaustion as a\n“defense”). The PLRA dealt extensively with the subject of\nexhaustion, see 42 U. S. C. §§1997e(a), (c)(2), but is silent\non the issue whether exhaustion must be pleaded by the\nplaintiff or is an affirmative defense. This is strong evi\ndence that the usual practice should be followed, and the\nusual practice under the Federal Rules is to regard ex\nhaustion as an affirmative defense.\n   In a series of recent cases, we have explained that courts\nshould generally not depart from the usual practice under\nthe Federal Rules on the basis of perceived policy con\n12                    JONES v. BOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncerns. Thus, in Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics\nIntelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163 (1993),\nwe unanimously reversed the court of appeals for imposing\na heightened pleading standard in §1983 suits against\nmunicipalities. We explained that “[p]erhaps if [the] Rules\n. . . were rewritten today, claims against municipalities\nunder §1983 might be subjected to the added specificity\nrequirement . . . . But that is a result which must be\nobtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules,\nand not by judicial interpretation.” Id., at 168.\n    In Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U. S. 506 (2002),\nwe unanimously reversed the court of appeals for requir\ning employment discrimination plaintiffs to specifically\nallege the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination.\nWe explained that “the Federal Rules do not contain a\nheightened pleading standard for employment discrimina\ntion suits,” and a “requirement of greater specificity for\nparticular claims” must be obtained by amending the\nFederal Rules. Id., at 515 (citing Leatherman). And just\nlast Term, in Hill v. McDonough, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), we\nunanimously rejected a proposal that §1983 suits challeng\ning a method of execution must identify an acceptable\nalternative: “Specific pleading requirements are mandated\nby the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and not, as a\ngeneral rule, through case-by-case determinations of the\nfederal courts.”     Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (citing\nSwierkiewicz).\n    The Sixth Circuit and other courts requiring prisoners\nto plead and demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints\ncontend that if the “new regime” mandated by the PLRA\nfor prisoner complaints is to function effectively, prisoner\ncomplaints must be treated outside of this typical frame\nwork. See Baxter, 305 F. 3d, at 489. These courts explain\nthat the PLRA not only imposed a new mandatory exhaus\ntion requirement, but also departed in a fundamental way\nfrom the usual procedural ground rules by requiring judi\n                   Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)             13\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ncial screening to filter out nonmeritorious claims: Courts\nare to screen inmate complaints “before docketing, if\nfeasible, or . . . as soon as practicable after docketing,” and\ndismiss the complaint if it is “frivolous, malicious, . . . fails\nto state a claim upon which relief may be granted[,] or . . .\nseeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune\nfrom such relief.” 28 U. S. C. §§1915A(a), (b). All this may\ntake place before any responsive pleading is filed—unlike\nin the typical civil case, defendants do not have to respond\nto a complaint covered by the PLRA until required to do so\nby the court, and waiving the right to reply does not con\nstitute an admission of the allegations in the complaint.\nSee 42 U. S. C. §1997e(g)(1), (2). According to respon\ndents, these departures from the normal litigation frame\nwork of complaint and response mandate a different\npleading requirement for prisoner complaints, if the\nscreening is to serve its intended purpose. See, e.g., Bax\nter, supra, at 489 (“This court’s heightened pleading stan\ndards for complaints covered by the PLRA are designed to\nfacilitate the Act’s screening requirements . . .”); Knuckles\nEl, 215 F. 3d, at 642. See also Brief for Respondents 17.\n   We think that the PLRA’s screening requirement does\nnot—explicitly or implicitly—justify deviating from the\nusual procedural practice beyond the departures specified\nby the PLRA itself. Before the PLRA, the in forma pau\nperis provision of §1915, applicable to most prisoner litiga\ntion, permitted sua sponte dismissal only if an action was\nfrivolous or malicious. 28 U. S. C. §1915(d) (1994 ed.); see\nalso Neitzke, 490 U. S., at 320 (concluding that a com\nplaint that fails to state a claim was not frivolous under\n§1915(d) and thus could not be dismissed sua sponte). In\nthe PLRA, Congress added failure to state a claim and\nseeking monetary relief from a defendant immune from\nsuch relief as grounds for sua sponte dismissal of in forma\npauperis cases, §1915(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.), and provided for\njudicial screening and sua sponte dismissal of prisoner\n14                      JONES v. BOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuits on the same four grounds, §1915A(b); 42 U. S. C.\n§1997e(c)(1). Although exhaustion was a “centerpiece” of\nthe PLRA, Woodford, 548 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1–2),\nfailure to exhaust was notably not added in terms to this\nenumeration. There is thus no reason to suppose that the\nnormal pleading rules have to be altered to facilitate\njudicial screening of complaints specifically for failure to\nexhaust.\n   Some courts have found that exhaustion is subsumed\nunder the PLRA’s enumerated ground authorizing early\ndismissal for “fail[ure] to state a claim upon which relief\nmay be granted.” 28 U. S. C. §§1915A(b)(1), 1915(e)(2)(B);\n42 U. S. C. §1997e(c)(1). See Baxter, supra, at 489; Steele\nv. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 355 F. 3d 1204, 1210 (CA10\n2003); Rivera v. Allin, 144 F. 3d 719, 731 (CA11 1998).\nThe point is a bit of a red herring. A complaint is subject\nto dismissal for failure to state a claim if the allegations,\ntaken as true, show the plaintiff is not entitled to relief. If\nthe allegations, for example, show that relief is barred by\nthe applicable statute of limitations, the complaint is\nsubject to dismissal for failure to state a claim; that does\nnot make the statute of limitations any less an affirmative\ndefense, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). Whether a particu\nlar ground for opposing a claim may be the basis for dis\nmissal for failure to state a claim depends on whether the\nallegations in the complaint suffice to establish that\nground, not on the nature of the ground in the abstract.\nSee Leveto v. Lapina, 258 F. 3d 156, 161 (CA3 2001) (“[A]\ncomplaint may be subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)\nwhen an affirmative defense . . . appears on its face” (in\nternal quotation marks omitted)).          See also Lopez-\nGonzalez v. Municipality of Comerio, 404 F. 3d 548, 551\n(CA1 2005) (dismissing a complaint barred by the statute\nof limitations under Rule 12(b)(6)); Pani v. Empire Blue\nCross Blue Shield, 152 F. 3d 67, 74–75 (CA2 1998) (dis\nmissing a complaint barred by official immunity under\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRule 12(b)(6)). See also 5B C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal\nPractice and Procedure §1357, pp. 708–710, 721–729 (3d\ned. 2004). Determining that Congress meant to include\nfailure to exhaust under the rubric of “failure to state a\nclaim” in the screening provisions of the PLRA would thus\nnot support treating exhaustion as a pleading requirement\nrather than an affirmative defense.\n   The argument that screening would be more effective if\nexhaustion had to be shown in the complaint proves too\nmuch; the same could be said with respect to any affirma\ntive defense. The rejoinder that the PLRA focused on\nexhaustion rather than other defenses simply highlights\nthe failure of Congress to include exhaustion in terms\namong the enumerated grounds justifying dismissal upon\nearly screening. As noted, that is not to say that failure to\nexhaust cannot be a basis for dismissal for failure to state\na claim. It is to say that there is no basis for concluding\nthat Congress implicitly meant to transform exhaustion\nfrom an affirmative defense to a pleading requirement by\nthe curiously indirect route of specifying that courts\nshould screen PLRA complaints and dismiss those that\nfail to state a claim.\n   Respondents point to 42 U. S. C. §1997e(g) as confirm\ning that the usual pleading rules should not apply to\nPLRA suits, but we think that provision supports petition\ners. It specifies that defendants can waive their right to\nreply to a prisoner complaint without the usual conse\nquence of being deemed to have admitted the allegations\nin the complaint. See §1997e(g)(1) (allowing defendants to\nwaive their response without admitting the allegations\n“[n]otwithstanding any other law or rule of procedure”).\nThis shows that when Congress meant to depart from the\nusual procedural requirements, it did so expressly.\n   We conclude that failure to exhaust is an affirmative\ndefense under the PLRA, and that inmates are not re\nquired to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in\n16                         JONES v. BOCK\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntheir complaints. We understand the reasons behind the\ndecisions of some lower courts to impose a pleading re\nquirement on plaintiffs in this context, but that effort\ncannot fairly be viewed as an interpretation of the PLRA.\n“Whatever temptations the statesmanship of policy-\nmaking might wisely suggest,” the judge’s job is to con\nstrue the statute—not to make it better. Frankfurter,\nSome Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum.\nL. Rev. 527, 533 (1947). The judge “must not read in by\nway of creation,” but instead abide by the “duty of re\nstraint, th[e] humility of function as merely the translator\nof another’s command.” Id., at 533–534. See United\nStates v. Goldenberg, 168 U. S. 95, 103 (1897) (“No mere\nomission . . . which it may seem wise to have specifically\nprovided for, justif[ies] any judicial addition to the lan\nguage of the statute”). Given that the PLRA does not\nitself require plaintiffs to plead exhaustion, such a result\n“must be obtained by the process of amending the Federal\nRules, and not by judicial interpretation.” Leatherman,\n507 U. S., at 168.\n                            III\n  The Sixth Circuit threw out the Williams and Walton\nsuits because those prisoners had not identified in their\ninitial grievances each defendant they later sued. 136\nFed.

Appx. 846, 849 (CA6 2005) (“At\nthat point [after he learned, in response to a Step I grievance, that\nGearin was responsible for the upper slot restriction], Walton was\narmed with all of the information that he needed to file a Step I griev\nance against . . .

The PLRA re\nquires exhaustion of “such administrative remedies as are\navailable,” 42 U. S. C. §1997e(a), but nothing in the stat\nute imposes a “name all defendants” requirement along\nthe lines of the Sixth Circuit’s judicially created rule.\nRespondents argue that without such a rule the exhaus\ntion requirement would become a “ ‘useless appendage,’ ”\nBrief for Respondents 44 (quoting Woodford, 548 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 11)), but the assertion is hyperbole, and\nthe citation of Woodford misplaced.\n   Woodford held that “proper exhaustion” was required\nunder the PLRA, and that this requirement was not satis\nfied when grievances were dismissed because prisoners\nhad missed deadlines set by the grievance policy. Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 11–13). At the time each of the grievances\nat issue here was filed, in contrast, the MDOC policy did\nnot contain any provision specifying who must be named\nin a grievance. MDOC’s policy required only that prison\ners “be as specific as possible” in their grievances, 1 App.\n148, while at the same time the required forms advised\nthem to “[b]e brief and concise.” 2 id., at 1. The MDOC\ngrievance form does not require a prisoner to identify a\nparticular responsible party, and the respondent is not\nnecessarily the allegedly culpable prison official, but\nrather an administrative official designated in the policy\nto respond to particular types of grievances at different\nlevels. Supra, at 6. The grievance policy specifically\nprovides that the grievant at Step I “shall have the oppor\ntunity to explain the grievance more completely at [an]\ninterview, enabling the Step I respondent to gather any\nadditional information needed to respond to the griev\nance.” 1 App. 151. Nothing in the MDOC policy itself\nsupports the conclusion that the grievance process was\n—————— \n\nroute”). At oral argument, Michigan admitted that it did not agree\n\nwith at least this application of the rule. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44–45. \n\n18                     JONES v. BOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimproperly invoked simply because an individual later\nnamed as a defendant was not named at the first step of\nthe grievance process.\n   Nor does the PLRA impose such a requirement. In\nWoodford, we held that to properly exhaust administrative\nremedies prisoners must “complete the administrative\nreview process in accordance with the applicable proce\ndural rules,” 548 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 5)—rules that are\ndefined not by the PLRA, but by the prison grievance\nprocess itself. Compliance with prison grievance proce\ndures, therefore, is all that is required by the PLRA to\n“properly exhaust.” The level of detail necessary in a\ngrievance to comply with the grievance procedures will\nvary from system to system and claim to claim, but it is\nthe prison’s requirements, and not the PLRA, that define\nthe boundaries of proper exhaustion. As the MDOC’s\nprocedures make no mention of naming particular offi\ncials, the Sixth Circuit’s rule imposing such a prerequisite\nto proper exhaustion is unwarranted.\n   We have identified the benefits of exhaustion to include\nallowing a prison to address complaints about the program\nit administers before being subjected to suit, reducing\nlitigation to the extent complaints are satisfactorily re\nsolved, and improving litigation that does occur by leading\nto the preparation of a useful record. See id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6–8); Porter, 534 U. S., at 524–525. The Sixth\nCircuit rule may promote early notice to those who might\nlater be sued, but that has not been thought to be one of\nthe leading purposes of the exhaustion requirement. See\nJohnson, 385 F. 3d, at 522 (“We are mindful that the\nprimary purpose of a grievance is to alert prison officials\nto a problem, not to provide personal notice to a particular\nofficial that he may be sued; the grievance is not a sum\nmons and complaint that initiates adversarial litigation”);\nsee also Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as\nAmici Curiae 8–9, and n. 6 (collecting grievance proce\n                     Cite as: 549 U.

We leave it to the court below in the first\ninstance to determine the sufficiency of the exhaustion in\nthese cases.\n                              IV\n  The final issue concerns how courts should address\ncomplaints in which the prisoner has failed to exhaust\nsome, but not all, of the claims asserted in the complaint.8\nAll agree that no unexhausted claim may be considered.\nThe issue is whether the court should proceed with the\nexhausted claims, or instead—as the Sixth Circuit has\nheld—dismiss the entire action if any one claim is not\nproperly exhausted. See Jones Bey, 407 F. 3d, at 807.9\n  Here the Sixth Circuit can point to language in the\nPLRA in support of its rule. Section 1997e(a) provides\nthat “[n]o action shall be brought” unless administrative\n——————\n  8 Although we reverse the Sixth Circuit’s rulings on the substantive\n\nexhaustion requirements as to all three petitioners, the question\nwhether a total exhaustion rule is contemplated by the PLRA is not\nmoot. In Jones’s case, the Sixth Circuit ruled in the alternative that\ntotal exhaustion required dismissal. 135 Fed. Appx. 837, 839 (CA6\n2005) (per curiam) (“[E]ven if Jones had shown he had exhausted some\nof his claims, the district court properly dismissed the complaint\nbecause Jones did not show that he had exhausted all of his claims”).\n  9 After we granted certiorari, the Sixth Circuit suggested that the\n\nadoption of a total exhaustion rule in that Circuit in Jones Bey ran\ncontrary to previous panel decisions and was therefore not controlling.\nSpencer v. Bouchard, 449 F. 3d 721, 726 (2006). See also Rule 206(c)\n(CA6 2006). As total exhaustion was applied in the cases under review,\nand the Sixth Circuit is not the only court to apply this rule, we do not\nconcern ourselves with this possible intracircuit split.\n20                     JONES v. BOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprocedures are exhausted. Respondents argue that if\nCongress intended courts to dismiss only unexhausted\nclaims while retaining the balance of the lawsuit, the word\n“claim” rather than “action” would have been used in this\nprovision.\n   This statutory phrasing—“no action shall be brought”—\nis boilerplate language. There are many instances in the\nFederal Code where similar language is used, but such\nlanguage has not been thought to lead to the dismissal of\nan entire action if a single claim fails to meet the perti\nnent standards. Statutes of limitations, for example, are\noften introduced by a variant of the phrase “no action shall\nbe brought,” see, e.g., Beach v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, 523 U. S.\n410, 416 (1998); 18 U. S. C. §1030(g) (2000 ed., Supp. IV),\nbut we have never heard of an entire complaint being\nthrown out simply because one of several discrete claims\nwas barred by the statute of limitations, and it is hard to\nimagine what purpose such a rule would serve. The same\nis true with respect to other uses of the “no action shall be\nbrought” phrasing. See, e.g., Hawksbill Sea Turtle v.\nFederal Emergency Management Agency, 126 F. 3d 461,\n471 (CA3 1997) (dismissing only claims that fail to comply\nwith the citizen suit notification requirement of 16 U. S. C.\n§1540(g)(2), which states that “[n]o action may be com\nmenced” until an agency has declined to act after being\ngiven written notice).\n   More generally, statutory references to an “action” have\nnot typically been read to mean that every claim included\nin the action must meet the pertinent requirement before\nthe “action” may proceed.

S. ____ (2007)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naction” even if every claim did not satisfy jurisdictional\nprerequisites).\n   As a general matter, if a complaint contains both good\nand bad claims, the court proceeds with the good and\nleaves the bad. “[O]nly the bad claims are dismissed; the\ncomplaint as a whole is not. If Congress meant to depart\nfrom this norm, we would expect some indication of that,\nand we find none.” Robinson v. Page, 170 F. 3d 747, 748–\n749 (CA7 1999) (considering §1997e(e)).\n   Respondents note an exception to this general rule, the\ntotal exhaustion rule in habeas corpus. In Rose v. Lundy,\n455 U. S. 509, 522 (1982), we held that “mixed” habeas\npetitions—containing both exhausted and unexhausted\nclaims—cannot be adjudicated. This total exhaustion rule\napplied in habeas was initially derived from considera\ntions of “comity and federalism,” not any statutory com\nmand. Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269, 273 (2005); id., at\n274 (noting that Congress “preserved Lundy’s total ex\nhaustion requirement” in 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(1)(A)).\nSeparate claims in a single habeas petition generally seek\nthe same relief from custody, and success on one is often\nas good as success on another. In such a case it makes\nsense to require exhaustion of all claims in state court\nbefore allowing the federal action to proceed. A typical\nPLRA suit with multiple claims, on the other hand, may\ncombine a wide variety of discrete complaints, about in\nteractions with guards, prison conditions, generally appli\ncable rules, and so on, seeking different relief on each\nclaim. There is no reason failure to exhaust on one neces\nsarily affects any other. In any event, even if the habeas\ntotal exhaustion rule is pertinent, it does not in fact depart\nfrom the usual practice—as we recently held, a court\npresented with a mixed habeas petition “should allow the\npetitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed\nwith the exhausted claims . . . .” Rhines, supra, at 278.\nThis is the opposite of the rule the Sixth Circuit adopted,\n22                      JONES v. BOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand precisely the rule that respondents argue against.\n  Respondents’ reading of 42 U. S. C. §1997e(a) to contain\na total exhaustion rule is bolstered by the fact that other\nsections of the PLRA distinguish between actions and\nclaims. Section 1997e(c)(1), for example, provides that a\ncourt shall dismiss an action for one of four enumerated\ndeficiencies, while §1997e(c)(2) allows a court to dismiss a\nclaim for one of these reasons without first determining\nwhether the claim is exhausted. Similarly, 28 U. S. C.\n§1915A(b) directs district courts to dismiss “the complaint,\nor any portion of the complaint” before docketing under\ncertain circumstances. This demonstrates that Congress\nknew how to differentiate between the entire action and\nparticular claims when it wanted to, and suggests that its\nuse of “action” rather than “claim” in 42 U. S. C. §1997e(a)\nshould be given effect.\n  But the interpretation respondents advocate creates its\nown inconsistencies. Section 1997e(e) contains similar\nlanguage, “[n]o . . . action may be brought . . . for mental or\nemotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior\nshowing of physical injury,” yet respondents cite no case\ninterpreting this provision to require dismissal of the\nentire lawsuit if only one claim does not comply, and again\nwe see little reason for such an approach. Accord, Cassidy\nv. Indiana Dept. of Corrections, 199 F. 3d 374, 376–377\n(CA7 2000) (dismissing only the portions of the complaint\nbarred by §1997e(e)); see also Williams v. Ollis, 230 F. 3d\n1361 (CA6 2000) (unpublished table decision) (same).\nInterpreting the phrase “no action shall be brought” to\nrequire dismissal of the entire case under §1997e(a) but\nnot §1997e(e) would contravene our normal rules of statu\ntory construction. National Credit Union Admin. v. First\nNat. Bank & Trust Co., 522 U. S. 479, 501–502 (1998).\n  In pressing the total exhaustion argument, respondents\nalso marshal the policy and purpose underlying the\nPLRA—this time in a supporting rather than lead role.\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            23\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThe invigorated exhaustion requirement is a “centerpiece”\nof the statute, Woodford, 548 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1–2),\nand if the exhaustion requirement of §1997e(a) is not\neffectuated by a total exhaustion rule, they argue, inmates\nwill have little incentive to ensure that they have ex\nhausted all available administrative remedies before\nproceeding to court. The PLRA mandated early judicial\nscreening to reduce the burden of prisoner litigation on the\ncourts; a total exhaustion rule allows courts promptly to\ndismiss an action upon identifying an unexhausted claim.\nThe alternative approach turns judges into editors of\nprisoner complaints, rather than creating an incentive for\nprisoners to exhaust properly. See Ross v. County of\nBernalillo, 365 F. 3d 1181, 1190 (CA10 2004).\n   We are not persuaded by these policy arguments. In\nfact, the effect of a total exhaustion rule could be that\ninmates will file various claims in separate suits, to avoid\nthe possibility of an unexhausted claim tainting the oth\ners. That would certainly not comport with the purpose of\nthe PLRA to reduce the quantity of inmate suits. Addi\ntionally, district judges who delve into a prisoner com\nplaint only to realize it contains an unexhausted claim,\nrequiring dismissal of the entire complaint under the total\nexhaustion rule, will often have to begin the process all\nover again when the prisoner refiles. In light of typically\nshort prison grievance time limits, prisoners’ refiled com\nplaints will often be identical to what the district court\nwould have considered had it simply dismissed unex\nhausted claims as it encountered them and proceeded with\nthe exhausted ones. Perhaps filing fees and concerns\nabout the applicability of the “three strikes” rule, 28\nU. S. C. §1915(g), would mitigate these effects, but the\ndebate about consequences is close enough that there is no\nclear reason to depart from the more typical claim-by\nclaim approach.\n24                    JONES v. BOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                         *   *     *\n  We are not insensitive to the challenges faced by the\nlower federal courts in managing their dockets and at\ntempting to separate, when it comes to prisoner suits, not\nso much wheat from chaff as needles from haystacks. We\nonce again reiterate, however—as we did unanimously in\nLeatherman, Swierkiewicz, and Hill—that adopting differ\nent and more onerous pleading rules to deal with particu\nlar categories of cases should be done through established\nrulemaking procedures, and not on a case-by-case basis by\nthe courts.\n  The judgments of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Sixth Circuit are reversed, and the cases are re\nmanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145763/", "sha1": "e96c4520a9caa4bd8c7b0d0a43ffa4c93afd4903", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2006-012", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:07:21"}
