Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), announced a new rule and, if so, whether it applies retroactively on collateral review. We do not answer these questions, however, because petitioner\u0097a state prisoner seeking postconviction relief from the federal courts\u0097failed to comply with the gatekeeping requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). That failure deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to hear his claims. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand with instructions to direct the District Court to dismiss petitioner's habeas corpus application for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On October 31, 1994, a Washington jury convicted petitioner Lonnie Burton of rape, robbery, and burglary. App. 3-4. The state trial court initially entered judgment and sentence on December 19, 1994 (1994 judgment). In that judgment, the court sentenced Burton to a total of 562 months in prison. <i>State v. Burton,</i> No. 35747-6-1 etc., 86 Wash.App. 1046, 1997 WL 306429, *12 (Wash.App., June 9, 1997). The trial court rested the 562-month sentence on two alternative grounds under Washington's determinate sentencing scheme. First, it sentenced Burton to within-guidelines sentences for each offense\u0097153 months for robbery, 105 months for burglary, and 304 months for rape\u0097and directed that the sentences be served consecutively, for a total term of 562 months. <i>Id.,</i> at *13. Under Washington's \"multiple offense policy,\" imposition of consecutive sentences constitutes an \"exceptional\" sentence, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.94A.120(18), 9.94A.400(1)(a) (2000),<sup>[1]</sup> but the trial court justified such a sentence on the ground that running the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*795</span> three terms concurrently would result in a sentence \"clearly too lenient\" in light of the purposes of Washington's sentencing scheme. See \u00a7 9.94A.390(2)(i).<sup>[2]</sup> The second basis on which the court calculated a 562-month term was by running the sentences concurrently but imposing an exceptional sentence of 562 months solely for the rape conviction\u0097again on the ground that the total sentence would otherwise be \"clearly too lenient.\" <i>State v. Burton,</i> 86 Wash.App. 1046, 1997 WL 306429, at *13.</p>\n<p>After an unrelated prior conviction was overturned, Burton requested resentencing. Accordingly, over a year after the 1994 judgment, the trial court entered an amended judgment and sentence (1996 judgment), which, after recalculating Burton's offender scores, imposed a new sentence that relied solely on an exceptional 562-month sentence for the rape conviction, run concurrently with the other two terms. <i>Ibid.;</i> App. 45. On direct review, the Washington Court of Appeals upheld Burton's conviction, <i>State v. Burton, supra,</i> a decision the Washington Supreme Court declined to review, <i>State v. Burton,</i> 133 Wash.2d 1025, 950 P.2d 475 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1082, 118 S.Ct. 1533, 140 L.Ed.2d 683 (1998). The State Court of Appeals remanded for resentencing, however, because the trial court's exclusive reliance on the exceptional rape sentence decreased Burton's potential early release credits, raising vindictiveness concerns. <i>State v. Burton,</i> 86 Wash.App. 1046, 1997 WL 306429, at *14.</p>\n<p>In response, on March 16, 1998, the trial court entered a second amended judgment and sentence (1998 judgment). App. 3. In this judgment, the trial court recited the jury's 1994 guilty verdicts, <i>id.,</i> at 3-4, and again imposed a 562-month sentence, reverting to its original basis for doing so\u0097running the three within-guidelines sentences consecutively, <i>id.,</i> at 7, 29-32. Burton sought review of this sentence, but the Washington courts eventually rejected his challenges both on direct review and in state postconviction proceedings. <i>Id.,</i> at 43-55; App. to Brief for Petitioner 1a-4a.</p>\n<p>On December 28, 1998, while state review of his sentence was still pending, Burton filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (1998 petition). App. 34. The standard form he filled out warned applicants that they must \"ordinarily first exhaust . . . available state court remedies as to each ground on which\" they sought \"action by the federal court,\" or run the risk of being \"barred from presenting additional grounds at a later date.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 37-38. Burton nonetheless challenged his custody only by disputing the constitutionality of his three convictions, not by pressing any sentencing claims. Where the form requested the \"[d]ate of judgment of conviction,\" Burton listed \"Dec. 16, 1994,\" corresponding roughly to the date of the 1994 judgment. <i>Id.,</i> at 34. The form asked whether the applicant had \"any petition or appeal now pending in any court, either state or federal, as <i>to the judgment under attack,</i>\" to which Burton answered \"Yes,\" explaining that \"[the] sentence I received at resentencing is on direct appeal.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 40 (emphasis added). The District Court denied relief, <i>id.,</i> at 42, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, <i>Burton v. Walter,</i> 21 Fed. Appx. 632 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*796</span> 1060, 122 S.Ct. 1923, 152 L.Ed.2d 830 (2002).</p>\n<p>Over three years subsequent to filing the 1998 petition, after the Washington courts had rejected his sentencing challenges, Burton filed another federal habeas petition (2002 petition), again in the Western District of Washington. This time, Burton claimed to be contesting the 1998 judgment, and challenged only the constitutionality of his sentence. In particular, he alleged that it violated our decision in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), to the extent the sentencing court departed from a standard sentence based on its own factual determinations. The District Court again denied the petition, App. 77, and the Ninth Circuit again affirmed, <i>Burton v. Waddington,</i> 142 Fed. Appx. 297 (2005). Both courts rejected the State's contention that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition because Burton had not obtained an order from the Court of Appeals authorizing him to file a \"second or successive\" habeas petition, as required by the habeas gatekeeping provisions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). On the merits, the Ninth Circuit rejected Burton's <i>Apprendi</i> claim and agreed with the State that Burton could not benefit from <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, because that decision announced a new rule that did not apply retroactively to Burton's sentence. 142 Fed.Appx., at 299.</p>\n<p>It is this petition, the 2002 petition, that is before us today. We conclude, though, that because the 2002 petition is a \"second or successive\" petition that Burton did not seek or obtain authorization to file in the District Court, the District Court never had jurisdiction to consider it in the first place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) established a stringent set of procedures that a prisoner \"in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a), must follow if he wishes to file a \"second or successive\" habeas corpus application challenging that custody, \u00a7 2244(b)(1). In pertinent part, before filing the application in the district court, a prisoner \"shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\" \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). A three-judge panel of the court of appeals may authorize the filing of the second or successive application only if it presents a claim not previously raised that satisfies one of the two grounds articulated in \u00a7 2244(b)(2). \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C); <i>Gonzalez v. Crosby,</i> 545 U.S. 524, 529-530, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); see also <i>Felker v. Turpin,</i> 518 U.S. 651, 656-657, 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996).</p>\n<p>Burton's 2002 petition was a \"second or successive\" habeas application for which he did not seek, much less obtain, authorization to file. When Burton filed his first petition, the 1998 petition, he was being held in custody pursuant to the 1998 judgment, which had been entered some nine months earlier. When he filed his second petition, the 2002 petition, he was still being held in custody pursuant to the same 1998 judgment. In short, Burton twice brought claims contesting the same custody imposed by the same judgment of a state court. As a result, under AEDPA, he was required to receive authorization from the Court of Appeals before filing his second challenge. Because he did not do so, the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit determined that the 2002 petition was not \"second or successive\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*797</span> because, under <i>McCleskey v. Zant,</i> 499 U.S. 467, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991), Burton had a \"legitimate excuse for failing to raise\" his sentencing challenges in the 1998 petition. 142 Fed. Appx., at 299 (quoting <i>McCleskey, supra,</i> at 490, 111 S.Ct. 1454; internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that because Burton had not exhausted his sentencing claims in state court when he filed the 1998 petition, \"they were not ripe for federal habeas review\" at that time. 142 Fed. Appx., at 298.</p>\n<p>We assume for purposes of this case, without deciding, that the Ninth Circuit's \"legitimate excuse\" approach to determining whether a petition is \"second or successive\" is correct. That court's ruling that Burton had a \"legitimate excuse,\" however, is inconsistent with the precise practice we have explained governs in circumstances such as Burton's. The plurality opinion in <i>Rose v. Lundy,</i> 455 U.S. 509, 520-522, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982), stated that district courts should dismiss \"mixed petitions\"\u0097those with exhausted and unexhausted claims\u0097 and that petitioners with such petitions have two options. They may withdraw a mixed petition, exhaust the remaining claims, and return to district court with a fully exhausted petition. We have held that in such circumstances the later filed petition would not be \"second or successive.\" <i>Slack v. McDaniel,</i> 529 U.S. 473, 485-86, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, prisoners filing mixed petitions may proceed with only the exhausted claims, but doing so risks subjecting later petitions that raise new claims to rigorous procedural obstacles. <i>Lundy, supra,</i> at 520-521, 102 S.Ct. 1198 (plurality opinion); see also <i>Slack, supra,</i> at 486-487, 120 S.Ct. 1595. As noted, the form Burton used in filing his first petition warned of just that consequence. App. 37-38; <i>supra,</i> at 3. There is no basis in our cases for supposing, as the Ninth Circuit did, that a petitioner with unexhausted claims who chooses the second of these options\u0097 who elects to proceed to adjudication of his exhausted claims\u0097may later assert that a subsequent petition is not \"second or successive\" precisely because his new claims were unexhausted at the time he filed his first petition. This reasoning conflicts with both <i>Lundy</i> and \u00a7 2244(b) and would allow prisoners to file separate habeas petitions in the not uncommon situation where a conviction is upheld but a sentence is reversed. Such a result would be inconsistent with both the exhaustion requirement, with its purpose of reducing \"piecemeal litigation,\" <i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> 533 U.S. 167, 180, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001), and AEDPA, with its goal of \"streamlining federal habeas proceedings,\" <i>Rhines v. Weber,</i> 544 U.S. 269, 277, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005).</p>\n<p>Burton directs us to two decisions, <i>Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal,</i> 523 U.S. 637, 118 S.Ct. 1618, 140 L.Ed.2d 849 (1998), and <i>Slack, supra,</i> in which we have not regarded subsequent petitions to be \"second or successive.\" But these cases are readily distinguishable. In <i>Martinez-Villareal,</i> we held that the claim of a capital prisoner that he was insane and therefore could not be put to death was necessarily unripe until the State issued a warrant for his execution, and so the prisoner's subsequent request for consideration of that previously unripe claim was not \"second or successive\" for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b). 523 U.S., at 644-645, 118 S.Ct. 1618. But unlike Burton, the prisoner there had attempted to bring this claim in his initial habeas petition, prompting us to look to <i>Lundy</i> in concluding that the claim \"should be treated in the same manner as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*798</span> the claim of a petitioner who returns to a federal habeas court after exhausting state remedies,\" that is, characterizing it as not \"second or successive.\" <i>Martinez-Villareal,</i> 523 U.S., at 644, 118 S.Ct. 1618. Indeed, we expressly declined to address the situation where a petitioner fails to raise the claim in the initial petition. See <i>id.,</i> at 645 n., 118 S.Ct. 1618. In this case, Burton did not raise the relevant claims in his 1998 petition. Without more, therefore, our holding in <i>Martinez-Villareal</i> does not support the conclusion that Burton's 2002 petition was not \"second or successive.\"</p>\n<p><i>Slack</i> is equally unhelpful to Burton; that decision merely confirmed that when a \"first\" petition is dismissed because it contains unexhausted claims, a prisoner returning later with a fully exhausted petition would not confront the \"second or successive\" bar. 529 U.S., at 485-486, 120 S.Ct. 1595. We held that a \"petition filed after a mixed petition has been dismissed under <i>Rose v. Lundy</i><i> before the district court adjudicated any claims</i> is to be treated as `any other first petition' and is not a second or successive petition.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 487, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (emphasis added). See also <i>id.,</i> at 478, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (\"[A] habeas petition which is filed after an initial petition was dismissed <i>without adjudication on the merits</i> for failure to exhaust state remedies is not a `second or successive' petition\" (emphasis added)). Burton's case is quite different\u0097his first petition was not subject to dismissal as containing unexhausted claims, and in fact was adjudicated on the merits.</p>\n<p>Moving beyond the ground relied upon by the Ninth Circuit, Burton argues that his 1998 and 2002 petitions challenged different judgments. He notes that his 1998 petition identified the pertinent judgment as the 1994 judgment, App. 34, while the 2002 petition challenged the sentence imposed in the 1998 judgment. The 1998 judgment, however, had been entered nine months before Burton filed his first petition. That judgment, the same one challenged in the subsequent 2002 petition, was the judgment pursuant to which Burton was being detained. Unlike <i>In re Taylor,</i> 171 F.3d 185 (C.A.4 1999), cited by Burton, there was no new judgment intervening between the two habeas petitions. In his 1998 petition, Burton specifically described his unexhausted sentencing claims as claims \"as to the judgment under attack,\" App. 40, belying any notion that those claims arose from a judgment distinct from the one challenged in 1998.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Burton finally contends that had he not filed the 1998 petition when he did, and instead waited until state review of his sentencing claims was complete, he risked losing the opportunity to challenge his conviction in federal court due to AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations. See \u00a7 2244(d)(1). But this argument misreads AEDPA, which states that the limitations period applicable to \"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\" shall run from, as relevant here, \"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). \"Final judgment in a criminal case means sentence. The sentence is the judgment.\" <i>Berman v. United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*799</span> <i>States,</i> 302 U.S. 211, 212, 58 S.Ct. 164, 82 L.Ed. 204 (1937). Accordingly, Burton's limitations period did not begin until both his conviction <i>and</i> sentence \"became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\"\u0097which occurred well <i>after</i> Burton filed his 1998 petition.</p>\n<p>Burton argues in rebuttal that this reasoning would necessarily mean the District Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the 1998 petition, but he is mistaken. Section 2254(a) states that a district court \"shall entertain\" a habeas petition \"in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\" When he filed the 1998 petition, Burton assuredly was \"in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\"\u0097even if, at that point, the 1998 judgment was not final for purposes of triggering AEDPA's statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>The long and short of it is that Burton neither sought nor received authorization from the Court of Appeals before filing his 2002 petition, a \"second or successive\" petition challenging his custody, and so the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to direct the District Court to dismiss the habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  As we noted in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 298, n. 1, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Washington has since amended and recodified its criminal code. Citations are to provisions in effect at the time of Burton's sentencing.</p>\n<p>[2]  Specifically, the standard range sentences for rape, robbery, and burglary, if run concurrently, would have punished Burton as if he had committed only the rape. <i>State v. Burton,</i> No. 35747-6-I etc., 86 Wash.App. 1046, 1997 WL 306429, *11-*12 (Wash.App., June 9, 1997).</p>\n<p>[3]  For the same reasons, Burton's reliance on <i>Castro v. United States,</i> 540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), is misplaced. That case reversed a lower court's recharacterization of a motion requesting a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 as a first habeas petition. Here Burton filed his first habeas petition as such in 1998; it involves no similar \"recharacterization\" to recognize that the judgment pursuant to which Burton was confined at the time was the same judgment that gave rise to the sentence later challenged in his second habeas petition.</p>\n\n</div>",

In that\njudgment, the court sentenced Burton to a total of 562\n2                       BURTON v. STEWART\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nmonths in prison. State v. Burton, No. 35747\u20136\u2013I etc.,\n1997 WL 306429, *12 (Wash. App., June 9, 1997). The\ntrial court rested the 562-month sentence on two alterna\ntive grounds under Washington\u2019s determinate sentencing\nscheme. First, it sentenced Burton to within-guidelines\nsentences for each offense\u2014153 months for robbery, 105\nmonths for burglary, and 304 months for rape\u2014and di\nrected that the sentences be served consecutively, for a\ntotal term of 562 months.

Code \u00a7\u00a79.94A.120(18), 9.94A.400(1)(a) (2000),1 but\nthe trial court justified such a sentence on the ground that\nrunning the three terms concurrently would result in a\nsentence \u201cclearly too lenient\u201d in light of the purposes of\nWashington\u2019s sentencing scheme. See \u00a79.94A.390(2)(i).2\nThe second basis on which the court calculated a 562\nmonth term was by running the sentences concurrently\nbut imposing an exceptional sentence of 562 months solely\nfor the rape conviction\u2014again on the ground that the total\nsentence would otherwise be \u201cclearly too lenient.\u201d State v.\nBurton, 1997 WL 306429, at *13.\n   After an unrelated prior conviction was overturned,\nBurton requested resentencing. Accordingly, over a year\nafter the 1994 judgment, the trial court entered an\namended judgment and sentence (1996 judgment), which,\nafter recalculating Burton\u2019s offender scores, imposed a\nnew sentence that relied solely on an exceptional 562\nmonth sentence for the rape conviction, run concurrently\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As we noted in Blakely v.

S. 296, 298, n. 1\n\n(2004), Washington has since amended and recodified its criminal code.\nCitations are to provisions in effect at the time of Burton\u2019s sentencing.\n  2 Specifically, the standard range sentences for rape, robbery, and\n\nburglary, if run concurrently, would have punished Burton as if he had\ncommitted only the rape.

On direct re\nview, the Washington Court of Appeals upheld Burton\u2019s\nconviction, State v. Burton, supra, a decision the Washing\nton Supreme Court declined to review, State v. Burton,\n133 Wash. 2d 1025, 950 P. 2d 475 (1997), cert. denied, 523\nU. S. 1082 (1998). The State Court of Appeals remanded\nfor resentencing, however, because the trial court\u2019s exclu\nsive reliance on the exceptional rape sentence decreased\nBurton\u2019s potential early release credits, raising vindictive\nness concerns. State v. Burton, 1997 WL 306429, at *14.\n   In response, on March 16, 1998, the trial court entered a\nsecond amended judgment and sentence (1998 judgment).\nApp. 3. In this judgment, the trial court recited the jury\u2019s\n1994 guilty verdicts, id., at 3\u20134, and again imposed a 562\nmonth sentence, reverting to its original basis for doing\nso\u2014running the three within-guidelines sentences con\nsecutively. Id., at 7, 29\u201332. Burton sought review of this\nsentence, but the Washington courts eventually rejected\nhis challenges both on direct review and in state postcon\nviction proceedings. Id., at 43\u201355; App. to Brief for Peti\ntioner 1a\u20134a.\n   On December 28, 1998, while state review of his sen\ntence was still pending, Burton filed a petition under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254 for a writ of habeas corpus in the United\nStates District Court for the Western District of Washing\nton (1998 petition). App. 34. The standard form he filled\nout warned applicants that they must \u201cordinarily first\nexhaust . . . available state court remedies as to each\nground on which\u201d they sought \u201caction by the federal\ncourt,\u201d or run the risk of being \u201cbarred from presenting\nadditional grounds at a later date.\u201d Id., at 37\u201338. Burton\nnonetheless challenged his custody only by disputing the\nconstitutionality of his three convictions, not by pressing\nany sentencing claims. Where the form requested the\n\u201c[d]ate of judgment of conviction,\u201d Burton listed \u201cDec. 16,\n1994,\u201d corresponding roughly to the date of the 1994\n4                   BURTON v. STEWART\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\njudgment. Id., at 34. The form asked whether the appli\ncant had \u201cany petition or appeal now pending in any court,\neither state or federal, as to the judgment under attack,\u201d to\nwhich Burton answered \u201cYes,\u201d explaining that \u201c[the]\nsentence I received at resentencing is on direct appeal.\u201d\nId., at 40 (emphasis added). The District Court denied\nrelief, id., at 42, and the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit affirmed, Burton v. Walter, 21 Fed.\nAppx. 632 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U. S. 1060 (2002).\n   Over three years subsequent to filing the 1998 petition,\nafter the Washington courts had rejected his sentencing\nchallenges, Burton filed another federal habeas petition\n(2002 petition), again in the Western District of Washing\nton. This time, Burton claimed to be contesting the 1998\njudgment, and challenged only the constitutionality of his\nsentence. In particular, he alleged that it violated our\ndecision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000),\nto the extent the sentencing court departed from a stan\ndard sentence based on its own factual determinations.\nThe District Court again denied the petition, App. 77, and\nthe Ninth Circuit again affirmed, Burton v. Waddington,\n142 Fed. Appx. 297 (2005). Both courts rejected the\nState\u2019s contention that the District Court lacked jurisdic\ntion to entertain the petition because Burton had not\nobtained an order from the Court of Appeals authorizing\nhim to file a \u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas petition, as\nrequired by the habeas gatekeeping provisions, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72244(b)(3). On the merits, the Ninth Circuit rejected\nBurton\u2019s Apprendi claim and agreed with the State that\nBurton could not benefit from Blakely v. Washington, 542\nU. S. 296, because that decision announced a new rule\nthat did not apply retroactively to Burton\u2019s sentence. 142\nFed. Appx., at 299.\n   It is this petition, the 2002 petition, that is before us\ntoday. We conclude, though, that because the 2002 peti\ntion is a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition that Burton did\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nnot seek or obtain authorization to file in the District\nCourt, the District Court never had jurisdiction to consider\nit in the first place.\n                              II\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA) established a stringent set of procedures\nthat a prisoner \u201cin custody pursuant to the judgment of a\nState court,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(a), must follow if he wishes\nto file a \u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas corpus application\nchallenging that custody, \u00a72244(b)(1). In pertinent part,\nbefore filing the application in the district court, a pris\noner \u201cshall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an\norder authorizing the district court to consider the appli\ncation.\u201d \u00a72244(b)(3)(A). A three-judge panel of the court of\nappeals may authorize the filing of the second or succes\nsive application only if it presents a claim not previously\nraised that satisfies one of the two grounds articulated in\n\u00a72244(b)(2). \u00a72244(b)(3)(C); Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S.\n524, 529\u2013530 (2005); see also Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S.\n651, 656\u2013657, 664 (1996).\n   Burton\u2019s 2002 petition was a \u201csecond or successive\u201d\nhabeas application for which he did not seek, much less\nobtain, authorization to file. When Burton filed his first\npetition, the 1998 petition, he was being held in custody\npursuant to the 1998 judgment, which had been entered\nsome nine months earlier. When he filed his second peti\ntion, the 2002 petition, he was still being held in custody\npursuant to the same 1998 judgment. In short, Burton\ntwice brought claims contesting the same custody imposed\nby the same judgment of a state court. As a result, under\nAEDPA, he was required to receive authorization from the\nCourt of Appeals before filing his second challenge. Be\ncause he did not do so, the District Court was without\njurisdiction to entertain it.\n   The Ninth Circuit determined that the 2002 petition\n6                   BURTON v. STEWART\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nwas not \u201csecond or successive\u201d because, under McCleskey\nv. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), Burton had a \u201clegitimate\nexcuse for failing to raise\u201d his sentencing challenges in the\n1998 petition. 142 Fed. Appx., at 299 (quoting McCleskey,\nsupra, at 490; internal quotation marks omitted). Specifi\ncally, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that because Burton had\nnot exhausted his sentencing claims in state court when\nhe filed the 1998 petition, \u201cthey were not ripe for federal\nhabeas review\u201d at that time. 142 Fed. Appx., at 298.\n   We assume for purposes of this case, without deciding,\nthat the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201clegitimate excuse\u201d approach to\ndetermining whether a petition is \u201csecond or successive\u201d is\ncorrect. That court\u2019s ruling that Burton had a \u201clegitimate\nexcuse,\u201d however, is inconsistent with the precise practice\nwe have explained governs in circumstances such as Bur\nton\u2019s. The plurality opinion in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S.\n509, 520\u2013522 (1982), stated that district courts should\ndismiss \u201cmixed petitions\u201d\u2014those with exhausted and\nunexhausted claims\u2014and that petitioners with such\npetitions have two options. They may withdraw a mixed\npetition, exhaust the remaining claims, and return to\ndistrict court with a fully exhausted petition. We have\nheld that in such circumstances the later filed petition\nwould not be \u201csecond or successive.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel,\n529 U. S. 473, 485\u2013486 (2000).\n   Alternatively, prisoners filing mixed petitions may\nproceed with only the exhausted claims, but doing so risks\nsubjecting later petitions that raise new claims to rigorous\nprocedural obstacles. Lundy, supra, at 520\u2013521 (plurality\nopinion); see also Slack, supra, at 486\u2013487. As noted, the\nform Burton used in filing his first petition warned of just\nthat consequence. App. 37\u201338, supra, at 3. There is no\nbasis in our cases for supposing, as the Ninth Circuit did,\nthat a petitioner with unexhausted claims who chooses the\nsecond of these options\u2014who elects to proceed to adjudica\ntion of his exhausted claims\u2014may later assert that a\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nsubsequent petition is not \u201csecond or successive\u201d precisely\nbecause his new claims were unexhausted at the time he\nfiled his first petition. This reasoning conflicts with both\nLundy and \u00a72244(b) and would allow prisoners to file\nseparate habeas petitions in the not uncommon situation\nwhere a conviction is upheld but a sentence is reversed.\nSuch a result would be inconsistent with both the exhaus\ntion requirement, with its purpose of reducing \u201cpiecemeal\nlitigation,\u201d Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 180 (2001),\nand AEDPA, with its goal of \u201cstreamlining federal habeas\nproceedings.\u201d Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269, 277 (2005).\n   Burton directs us to two decisions, Stewart v. Martinez-\nVillareal, 523 U. S. 637 (1998), and Slack, supra, in which\nwe have not regarded subsequent petitions to be \u201csecond\nor successive.\u201d But these cases are readily distinguish\nable. In Martinez-Villareal, we held that the claim of a\ncapital prisoner that he was insane and therefore could\nnot be put to death was necessarily unripe until the State\nissued a warrant for his execution, and so the prisoner\u2019s\nsubsequent request for consideration of that previously\nunripe claim was not \u201csecond or successive\u201d for purposes of\n\u00a72244(b). 523 U. S., at 644\u2013645. But unlike Burton, the\nprisoner there had attempted to bring this claim in his\ninitial habeas petition, prompting us to look to Lundy in\nconcluding that the claim \u201cshould be treated in the same\nmanner as the claim of a petitioner who returns to a fed\neral habeas court after exhausting state remedies,\u201d that is,\ncharacterizing it as not \u201csecond or successive.\u201d Martinez-\nVillareal, 523 U. S., at 644. Indeed, we expressly declined\nto address the situation where a petitioner fails to raise\nthe claim in the initial petition. See id., at 645, n. In this\ncase, Burton did not raise the relevant claims in his 1998\npetition. Without more, therefore, our holding in Marti\nnez-Villareal does not support the conclusion that Burton\u2019s\n2002 petition was not \u201csecond or successive.\u201d\n   Slack is equally unhelpful to Burton; that decision\n8                      BURTON v. STEWART\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nmerely confirmed that when a \u201cfirst\u201d petition is dismissed\nbecause it contains unexhausted claims, a prisoner return\ning later with a fully exhausted petition would not con\nfront the \u201csecond or successive\u201d bar. 529 U. S., at 485\u2013\n486. We held that a \u201cpetition filed after a mixed petition\nhas been dismissed under Rose v. Lundy before the district\ncourt adjudicated any claims is to be treated as \u2018any other\nfirst petition\u2019 and is not a second or successive petition.\u201d\nId., at 487 (emphasis added). See also id., at 478 (\u201c[A]\nhabeas petition which is filed after an initial petition was\ndismissed without adjudication on the merits for failure to\nexhaust state remedies is not a \u2018second or successive\u2019\npetition\u201d (emphasis added)). Burton\u2019s case is quite differ\nent\u2014his first petition was not subject to dismissal as\ncontaining unexhausted claims, and in fact was adjudi\ncated on the merits.\n   Moving beyond the ground relied upon by the Ninth\nCircuit, Burton argues that his 1998 and 2002 petitions\nchallenged different judgments. He notes that his 1998\npetition identified the pertinent judgment as the 1994\njudgment, App. 34, while the 2002 petition challenged the\nsentence imposed in the 1998 judgment. The 1998 judg\nment, however, had been entered nine months before\nBurton filed his first petition. That judgment, the same\none challenged in the subsequent 2002 petition, was the\njudgment pursuant to which Burton was being detained.\nUnlike In re Taylor, 171 F. 3d 185 (CA4 1999), cited by\nBurton, there was no new judgment intervening between\nthe two habeas petitions. In his 1998 petition, Burton\nspecifically described his unexhausted sentencing claims\nas claims \u201cas to the judgment under attack,\u201d App. 40,\nbelying any notion that those claims arose from a judg\nment distinct from the one challenged in 1998.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 For the same reasons, Burton\u2019s reliance on Castro v. United States,\n\n540 U. S. 375 (2003), is misplaced. That case reversed a lower court\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)                    9\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n  Burton finally contends that had he not filed the 1998\npetition when he did, and instead waited until state re\nview of his sentencing claims was complete, he risked\nlosing the opportunity to challenge his conviction in fed\neral court due to AEDPA\u2019s 1-year statute of limitations.\nSee \u00a72244(d)(1). But this argument misreads AEDPA,\nwhich states that the limitations period applicable to \u201ca\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State\ncourt\u201d shall run from, as relevant here, \u201cthe date on which\nthe judgment became final by the conclusion of direct\nreview or the expiration of the time for seeking such re\nview.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). \u201cFinal judgment in a criminal case\nmeans sentence. The sentence is the judgment.\u201d Berman\nv. United States, 302 U. S. 211, 212 (1937). Accordingly,\nBurton\u2019s limitations period did not begin until both his\nconviction and sentence \u201cbecame final by the conclusion of\ndirect review or the expiration of the time for seeking such\nreview\u201d\u2014which occurred well after Burton filed his 1998\npetition.\n  Burton argues in rebuttal that this reasoning would\nnecessarily mean the District Court lacked jurisdiction to\nconsider the 1998 petition, but he is mistaken. Section\n2254(a) states that a district court \u201cshall entertain\u201d a\nhabeas petition \u201cin behalf of a person in custody pursuant\nto the judgment of a State court.\u201d When he filed the 1998\npetition, Burton assuredly was \u201cin custody pursuant to the\njudgment of a State court\u201d\u2014even if, at that point, the 1998\njudgment was not final for purposes of triggering AEDPA\u2019s\nstatute of limitations.\n  The long and short of it is that Burton neither sought\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nrecharacterization of a motion requesting a new trial pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 as a first habeas petition. Here\nBurton filed his first habeas petition as such in 1998; it involves no\nsimilar \u201crecharacterization\u201d to recognize that the judgment pursuant to\nwhich Burton was confined at the time was the same judgment that\ngave rise to the sentence later challenged in his second habeas petition.\n10                  BURTON v. STEWART\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nnor received authorization from the Court of Appeals\nbefore filing his 2002 petition, a \u201csecond or successive\u201d\npetition challenging his custody, and so the District Court\nwas without jurisdiction to entertain it. The judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore\nvacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to\ndirect the District Court to dismiss the habeas petition for\nlack of jurisdiction.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n",

App. 3-4. The state trial court initially entered judgment and sentence on December 19, 1994 (1994 judgment). In that judgment, the court sentenced Burton to a total of 562 months in prison. <i>State v. Burton,</i> No. 35747-6-1 etc., 86 Wash.App. 1046, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">306429</span></span>, *12 (Wash.App., June 9, 1997). The trial court rested the 562-month sentence on two alternative grounds under Washington's determinate sentencing scheme. First, it sentenced Burton to within-guidelines sentences for each offense\u0097153 months for robbery, 105 months for burglary, and 304 months for rape\u0097and directed that the sentences be served consecutively, for a total term of 562 months. <i>Id.,</i> at *13. Under Washington's \"multiple offense policy,\" imposition of consecutive sentences constitutes an \"exceptional\" sentence, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.94A.120(18), 9.94A.400(1)(a) (2000),<sup>[1]</sup> but the trial court justified such a sentence on the ground that running the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*795</span> three terms concurrently would result in a sentence \"clearly too lenient\" in light of the purposes of Washington's sentencing scheme. See \u00a7 9.94A.390(2)(i).<sup>[2]</sup> The second basis on which the court calculated a 562-month term was by running the sentences concurrently but imposing an exceptional sentence of 562 months solely for the rape conviction\u0097again on the ground that the total sentence would otherwise be \"clearly too lenient.\" <i>State v.

Accordingly, over a year after the 1994 judgment, the trial court entered an amended judgment and sentence (1996 judgment), which, after recalculating Burton's offender scores, imposed a new sentence that relied solely on an exceptional 562-month sentence for the rape conviction, run concurrently with the other two terms. <i>Ibid.;</i> App. 45. On direct review, the Washington Court of Appeals upheld Burton's conviction, <i>State v. Burton, supra,</i> a decision the Washington Supreme Court declined to review, <i>State v.

The State Court of Appeals remanded for resentencing, however, because the trial court's exclusive reliance on the exceptional rape sentence decreased Burton's potential early release credits, raising vindictiveness concerns. <i>State v.

In this judgment, the trial court recited the jury's 1994 guilty verdicts, <i>id.,</i> at 3-4, and again imposed a 562-month sentence, reverting to its original basis for doing so\u0097running the three within-guidelines sentences consecutively, <i>id.,</i> at 7, 29-32. Burton sought review of this sentence, but the Washington courts eventually rejected his challenges both on direct review and in state postconviction proceedings. <i>Id.,</i> at 43-55; App. to Brief for Petitioner 1a-4a.</p>\n<p>On December 28, 1998, while state review of his sentence was still pending, Burton filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (1998 petition). App. 34. The standard form he filled out warned applicants that they must \"ordinarily first exhaust . . . available state court remedies as to each ground on which\" they sought \"action by the federal court,\" or run the risk of being \"barred from presenting additional grounds at a later date.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 37-38. Burton nonetheless challenged his custody only by disputing the constitutionality of his three convictions, not by pressing any sentencing claims. Where the form requested the \"[d]ate of judgment of conviction,\" Burton listed \"Dec. 16, 1994,\" corresponding roughly to the date of the 1994 judgment. <i>Id.,</i> at 34. The form asked whether the applicant had \"any petition or appeal now pending in any court, either state or federal, as <i>to the judgment under attack,</i>\" to which Burton answered \"Yes,\" explaining that \"[the] sentence I received at resentencing is on direct appeal.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 40 (emphasis added). The District Court denied relief, <i>id.,</i> at 42, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, <i>Burton v. Walter,</i> 21 Fed. Appx. 632 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*796</span> 1060, 122 S.Ct. 1923, 152 L.Ed.2d 830 (2002).</p>\n<p>Over three years subsequent to filing the 1998 petition, after the Washington courts had rejected his sentencing challenges, Burton filed another federal habeas petition (2002 petition), again in the Western District of Washington. This time, Burton claimed to be contesting the 1998 judgment, and challenged only the constitutionality of his sentence. In particular, he alleged that it violated our decision in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), to the extent the sentencing court departed from a standard sentence based on its own factual determinations. The District Court again denied the petition, App. 77, and the Ninth Circuit again affirmed, <i>Burton v. Waddington,</i> 142 Fed. Appx. 297 (2005). Both courts rejected the State's contention that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition because Burton had not obtained an order from the Court of Appeals authorizing him to file a \"second or successive\" habeas petition, as required by the habeas gatekeeping provisions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). On the merits, the Ninth Circuit rejected Burton's <i>Apprendi</i> claim and agreed with the State that Burton could not benefit from <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, because that decision announced a new rule that did not apply retroactively to Burton's sentence. 142 Fed.Appx., at 299.</p>\n<p>It is this petition, the 2002 petition, that is before us today. We conclude, though, that because the 2002 petition is a \"second or successive\" petition that Burton did not seek or obtain authorization to file in the District Court, the District Court never had jurisdiction to consider it in the first place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) established a stringent set of procedures that a prisoner \"in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a), must follow if he wishes to file a \"second or successive\" habeas corpus application challenging that custody, \u00a7 2244(b)(1). In pertinent part, before filing the application in the district court, a prisoner \"shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\" \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). A three-judge panel of the court of appeals may authorize the filing of the second or successive application only if it presents a claim not previously raised that satisfies one of the two grounds articulated in \u00a7 2244(b)(2). \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C); <i>Gonzalez v. Crosby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799985\"><a href=\"/opinion/799985/gonzalez-v-crosby/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>, 529-530, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); see also <i>Felker v. Turpin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118058\"><a href=\"/opinion/118058/felker-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 656-657, 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996).</p>\n<p>Burton's 2002 petition was a \"second or successive\" habeas application for which he did not seek, much less obtain, authorization to file. When Burton filed his first petition, the 1998 petition, he was being held in custody pursuant to the 1998 judgment, which had been entered some nine months earlier. When he filed his second petition, the 2002 petition, he was still being held in custody pursuant to the same 1998 judgment. In short, Burton twice brought claims contesting the same custody imposed by the same judgment of a state court. As a result, under AEDPA, he was required to receive authorization from the Court of Appeals before filing his second challenge. Because he did not do so, the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit determined that the 2002 petition was not \"second or successive\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*797</span> because, under <i>McCleskey v. Zant,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112573\"><a href=\"/opinion/112573/mccleskey-v-zant/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991), Burton had a \"legitimate excuse for failing to raise\" his sentencing challenges in the 1998 petition. 142 Fed. Appx., at 299 (quoting <i>McCleskey, supra,</i> at 490, 111 S.Ct. 1454; internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that because Burton had not exhausted his sentencing claims in state court when he filed the 1998 petition, \"they were not ripe for federal habeas review\" at that time. 142 Fed. Appx., at 298.</p>\n<p>We assume for purposes of this case, without deciding, that the Ninth Circuit's \"legitimate excuse\" approach to determining whether a petition is \"second or successive\" is correct. That court's ruling that Burton had a \"legitimate excuse,\" however, is inconsistent with the precise practice we have explained governs in circumstances such as Burton's. The plurality opinion in <i>Rose v. Lundy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110662\"><a href=\"/opinion/110662/rose-v-lundy/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>, 520-522, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982), stated that district courts should dismiss \"mixed petitions\"\u0097those with exhausted and unexhausted claims\u0097 and that petitioners with such petitions have two options. They may withdraw a mixed petition, exhaust the remaining claims, and return to district court with a fully exhausted petition. We have held that in such circumstances the later filed petition would not be \"second or successive.\" <i>Slack v. McDaniel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118359\"><a href=\"/opinion/118359/slack-v-mcdaniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 485-86, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, prisoners filing mixed petitions may proceed with only the exhausted claims, but doing so risks subjecting later petitions that raise new claims to rigorous procedural obstacles. <i>Lundy, supra,</i> at 520-521, 102 S.Ct. 1198 (plurality opinion); see also <i>Slack, supra,</i> at 486-487, 120 S.Ct. 1595. As noted, the form Burton used in filing his first petition warned of just that consequence. App. 37-38; <i>supra,</i> at 3. There is no basis in our cases for supposing, as the Ninth Circuit did, that a petitioner with unexhausted claims who chooses the second of these options\u0097 who elects to proceed to adjudication of his exhausted claims\u0097may later assert that a subsequent petition is not \"second or successive\" precisely because his new claims were unexhausted at the time he filed his first petition. This reasoning conflicts with both <i>Lundy</i> and \u00a7 2244(b) and would allow prisoners to file separate habeas petitions in the not uncommon situation where a conviction is upheld but a sentence is reversed. Such a result would be inconsistent with both the exhaustion requirement, with its purpose of reducing \"piecemeal litigation,\" <i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269282/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 180, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001), and AEDPA, with its goal of \"streamlining federal habeas proceedings,\" <i>Rhines v. Weber,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142884\"><a href=\"/opinion/142884/rhines-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 277, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005).</p>\n<p>Burton directs us to two decisions, <i>Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118206\"><a href=\"/opinion/118206/stewart-v-martinez-villareal/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 118 S.Ct. 1618, 140 L.Ed.2d 849 (1998), and <i>Slack, supra,</i> in which we have not regarded subsequent petitions to be \"second or successive.\" But these cases are readily distinguishable. In <i>Martinez-Villareal,</i> we held that the claim of a capital prisoner that he was insane and therefore could not be put to death was necessarily unripe until the State issued a warrant for his execution, and so the prisoner's subsequent request for consideration of that previously unripe claim was not \"second or successive\" for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b). 523 U.S., at 644-645, 118 S.Ct. 1618. But unlike Burton, the prisoner there had attempted to bring this claim in his initial habeas petition, prompting us to look to <i>Lundy</i> in concluding that the claim \"should be treated in the same manner as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*798</span> the claim of a petitioner who returns to a federal habeas court after exhausting state remedies,\" that is, characterizing it as not \"second or successive.\" <i>Martinez-Villareal,</i> 523 U.S., at 644, 118 S.Ct. 1618. Indeed, we expressly declined to address the situation where a petitioner fails to raise the claim in the initial petition. See <i>id.,</i> at 645 n., 118 S.Ct. 1618. In this case, Burton did not raise the relevant claims in his 1998 petition. Without more, therefore, our holding in <i>Martinez-Villareal</i> does not support the conclusion that Burton's 2002 petition was not \"second or successive.\"</p>\n<p><i>Slack</i> is equally unhelpful to Burton; that decision merely confirmed that when a \"first\" petition is dismissed because it contains unexhausted claims, a prisoner returning later with a fully exhausted petition would not confront the \"second or successive\" bar. 529 U.S., at 485-486, 120 S.Ct. 1595. We held that a \"petition filed after a mixed petition has been dismissed under <i>Rose v. Lundy</i><i> before the district court adjudicated any claims</i> is to be treated as `any other first petition' and is not a second or successive petition.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 487, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (emphasis added). See also <i>id.,</i> at 478, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (\"[A] habeas petition which is filed after an initial petition was dismissed <i>without adjudication on the merits</i> for failure to exhaust state remedies is not a `second or successive' petition\" (emphasis added)). Burton's case is quite different\u0097his first petition was not subject to dismissal as containing unexhausted claims, and in fact was adjudicated on the merits.</p>\n<p>Moving beyond the ground relied upon by the Ninth Circuit, Burton argues that his 1998 and 2002 petitions challenged different judgments. He notes that his 1998 petition identified the pertinent judgment as the 1994 judgment, App. 34, while the 2002 petition challenged the sentence imposed in the 1998 judgment. The 1998 judgment, however, had been entered nine months before Burton filed his first petition. That judgment, the same one challenged in the subsequent 2002 petition, was the judgment pursuant to which Burton was being detained. Unlike <i>In re Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762551\"><a href=\"/opinion/762551/in-re-audwin-hawatha-taylor-movant/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span> (C.A.4 1999), cited by Burton, there was no new judgment intervening between the two habeas petitions. In his 1998 petition, Burton specifically described his unexhausted sentencing claims as claims \"as to the judgment under attack,\" App. 40, belying any notion that those claims arose from a judgment distinct from the one challenged in 1998.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Burton finally contends that had he not filed the 1998 petition when he did, and instead waited until state review of his sentencing claims was complete, he risked losing the opportunity to challenge his conviction in federal court due to AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations. See \u00a7 2244(d)(1). But this argument misreads AEDPA, which states that the limitations period applicable to \"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\" shall run from, as relevant here, \"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). \"Final judgment in a criminal case means sentence. The sentence is the judgment.\" <i>Berman v. United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*799</span> <i>States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102863\"><a href=\"/opinion/102863/berman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 212, 58 S.Ct. 164, 82 L.Ed. 204 (1937). Accordingly, Burton's limitations period did not begin until both his conviction <i>and</i> sentence \"became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\"\u0097which occurred well <i>after</i> Burton filed his 1998 petition.</p>\n<p>Burton argues in rebuttal that this reasoning would necessarily mean the District Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the 1998 petition, but he is mistaken. Section 2254(a) states that a district court \"shall entertain\" a habeas petition \"in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\" When he filed the 1998 petition, Burton assuredly was \"in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\"\u0097even if, at that point, the 1998 judgment was not final for purposes of triggering AEDPA's statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>The long and short of it is that Burton neither sought nor received authorization from the Court of Appeals before filing his 2002 petition, a \"second or successive\" petition challenging his custody, and so the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to direct the District Court to dismiss the habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  As we noted in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 298, n. 1, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Washington has since amended and recodified its criminal code. Citations are to provisions in effect at the time of Burton's sentencing.</p>\n<p>[2]  Specifically, the standard range sentences for rape, robbery, and burglary, if run concurrently, would have punished Burton as if he had committed only the rape. <i>State v. Burton,</i> No. 35747-6-I etc., 86 Wash.App. 1046, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">306429</span></span>, *11-*12 (Wash.App., June 9, 1997).</p>\n<p>[3]  For the same reasons, Burton's reliance on <i>Castro v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131151\"><a href=\"/opinion/131151/castro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), is misplaced. That case reversed a lower court's recharacterization of a motion requesting a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 as a first habeas petition. Here Burton filed his first habeas petition as such in 1998; it involves no similar \"recharacterization\" to recognize that the judgment pursuant to which Burton was confined at the time was the same judgment that gave rise to the sentence later challenged in his second habeas petition.</p>\n\n</div>",
