Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), instructed district courts to read the United States Sentencing Guidelines as \"effectively advisory,\" <i>id.,</i> at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738. In accord with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), the Guidelines, formerly mandatory, now serve as one factor among several courts must consider in determining an appropriate sentence. <i>Booker</i> further instructed that \"reasonableness\" is the standard controlling appellate review of the sentences district courts impose.</p>\n<p>Under the statute criminalizing the manufacture and distribution of crack cocaine, 21 U.S.C. § 841, and the relevant Guidelines prescription, § 2D1.1, a drug trafficker dealing in crack cocaine is subject to the same sentence as one dealing in 100 times more powder cocaine. The question here presented is whether, as the Court of Appeals held in this case, \"a sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\" 174 Fed.Appx. 798, 799 (C.A.4 2006) <i>(per curiam).</i> We hold that, under <i>Booker,</i> the cocaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only, and that the Court of Appeals erred in holding the crack/powder disparity effectively mandatory. A district judge must include the Guidelines range in the array of factors warranting consideration. The judge may determine, however, that, in the particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is \"greater than necessary\" to serve the objectives of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). In making that determination, the judge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines' treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In September 2004, petitioner Derrick Kimbrough was indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and charged with four offenses: conspiracy to distribute crack and powder cocaine; possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine; possession with intent to distribute powder cocaine; and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drugtrafficking offense. Kimbrough pleaded guilty to all four charges.</p>\n<p>Under the relevant statutes, Kimbrough's plea subjected him to an aggregate sentence of 15 years to life in prison: 10 years to life for the three drug offenses, plus a consecutive term of 5 years to life for the firearm offense.<sup>[1]</sup> In order to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*565</span> the appropriate sentence within this statutory range, the District Court first calculated Kimbrough's sentence under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines.<sup>[2]</sup> Kimbrough's guilty plea acknowledged that he was accountable for 56 grams of crack cocaine and 92.1 grams of powder cocaine. This quantity of drugs yielded a base offense level of 32 for the three drug charges. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 2D1.1(c) (Nov.2004) (USSG). Finding that Kimbrough, by asserting sole culpability for the crime, had testified falsely at his codefendant's trial, the District Court increased his offense level to 34. See § 3C1.1. In accord with the presentence report, the court determined that Kimbrough's criminal history category was II. An offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of II yielded a Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months for the three drug charges. See <i>id.,</i> ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. The Guidelines sentence for the firearm offense was the statutory minimum, 60 months. See USSG § 2K2.4(b). Kimbrough's final advisory Guidelines range was thus 228 to 270 months, or 19 to 22.5 years.</p>\n<p>A sentence in this range, in the District Court's judgment, would have been \"greater than necessary\" to accomplish the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). App. 72. As required by § 3553(a), the court took into account the \"nature and circumstances\" of the offense and Kimbrough's \"history and characteristics.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 72-73. The court also commented that the case exemplified the \"disproportionate and unjust effect that crack cocaine guidelines have in sentencing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 72. In this regard, the court contrasted Kimbrough's Guidelines range of 228 to 270 months with the range that would have applied had he been accountable for an equivalent amount of powder cocaine: 97 to 106 months, inclusive of the 5-year mandatory minimum for the firearm charge, see USSG § 2D1.1(c); <i>id.,</i> ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. Concluding that the statutory minimum sentence was \"clearly long enough\" to accomplish the objectives listed in § 3553(a), the court sentenced Kimbrough to 15 years, or 180 months, in prison plus 5 years of supervised release. App. 74-75.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In an unpublished <i>per curiam</i> opinion, the Fourth Circuit vacated the sentence. Under Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals observed, a sentence \"outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\" 174 Fed.Appx., at 799 (citing <i>United States v. Eura,</i> 440 F.3d 625, 633-634 (C.A.4 2006)).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2933, 168 L.Ed.2d 261 (2007), to determine whether the crack/powder disparity adopted in the United States Sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*566</span> Guidelines has been rendered \"advisory\" by our decision in <i>Booker.</i><sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We begin with some background on the different treatment of crack and powder cocaine under the federal sentencing laws. Crack and powder cocaine are two forms of the same drug. Powder cocaine, or cocaine hydrochloride, is generally inhaled through the nose; it may also be mixed with water and injected. See United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 5, 12 (Feb.1995), available at http://www.ussc.gov/crack/exec.htm (hereinafter 1995 Report). (All Internet materials as visited Dec. 7, 2007, and included in Clerk of Court's case file.) Crack cocaine, a type of cocaine base, is formed by dissolving powder cocaine and baking soda in boiling water. <i>Id.,</i> at 14. The resulting solid is divided into single-dose \"rocks\" that users smoke. <i>Ibid.</i> The active ingredient in powder and crack cocaine is the same. <i>Id.,</i> at 9. The two forms of the drug also have the same physiological and psychotropic effects, but smoking crack cocaine allows the body to absorb the drug much faster than inhaling powder cocaine, and thus produces a shorter, more intense high. <i>Id.,</i> at 15-19.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Although chemically similar, crack and powder cocaine are handled very differently for sentencing purposes. The 100  to  1 ratio yields sentences for crack offenses three to six times longer than those for powder offenses involving equal amounts of drugs. See United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy iv (May 2002), available at http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/02crack/ 2002crackrpt.pdf (hereinafter 2002 Report).<sup>[6]</sup> This disparity means that a major supplier of powder cocaine may receive a shorter sentence than a low-level dealer who buys powder from the supplier but then converts it to crack. See 1995 Report 193-194.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The crack/powder disparity originated in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (1986 Act), 100 Stat. 3207. The 1986 Act created a two-tiered scheme of five- and ten-year mandatory minimum sentences for drug manufacturing and distribution offenses. Congress sought \"to link the ten-year mandatory minimum trafficking prison term to major drug dealers and to link the five-year minimum term to serious traffickers.\" 1995 Report 119. The 1986 Act uses the weight of the drugs involved in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*567</span> the offense as the sole proxy to identify \"major\" and \"serious\" dealers. For example, any defendant responsible for 100 grams of heroin is subject to the five-year mandatory minimum, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(i) (2000 ed. and Supp V), and any defendant responsible for 1,000 grams of heroin is subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum, see § 841(b)(1)(A)(i).</p>\n<p>Crack cocaine was a relatively new drug when the 1986 Act was signed into law, but it was already a matter of great public concern: \"Drug abuse in general, and crack cocaine in particular, had become in public opinion and in members' minds a problem of overwhelming dimensions.\" 1995 Report 121. Congress apparently believed that crack was significantly more dangerous than powder cocaine in that: (1) crack was highly addictive; (2) crack users and dealers were more likely to be violent than users and dealers of other drugs; (3) crack was more harmful to users than powder, particularly for children who had been exposed by their mothers' drug use during pregnancy; (4) crack use was especially prevalent among teenagers; and (5) crack's potency and low cost were making it increasingly popular. See 2002 Report 90.</p>\n<p>Based on these assumptions, the 1986 Act adopted a \"100  to  1 ratio\" that treated every gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of powder cocaine. The Act's five-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for 5 grams of crack or 500 grams of powder, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(ii), (iii); its ten-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for 50 grams of crack or 5,000 grams of powder, § 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).</p>\n<p>While Congress was considering adoption of the 1986 Act, the Sentencing Commission was engaged in formulating the Sentencing Guidelines.<sup>[7]</sup> In the main, the Commission developed Guidelines sentences using an empirical approach based on data about past sentencing practices, including 10,000 presentence investigation reports. See USSG § 1A.1, intro. comment., pt. A, ¶ 3. The Commission \"modif[ied] and adjust[ed] past practice in the interests of greater rationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with congressional instructions, and the like.\" <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p>The Commission did not use this empirical approach in developing the Guidelines sentences for drug-trafficking offenses. Instead, it employed the 1986 Act's weightdriven scheme. The Guidelines use a drug quantity table based on drug type and weight to set base offense levels for drug trafficking offenses. See USSG § 2D1.1(c). In setting offense levels for crack and powder cocaine, the Commission, in line with the 1986 Act, adopted the 100  to  1 ratio. The statute itself specifies only two quantities of each drug, but the Guidelines \"go further and set sentences for the full range of possible drug quantities using the same 100  to  1 quantity ratio.\" 1995 Report 1. The Guidelines' drug quantity table sets base offense levels ranging from 12, for offenses involving less than 250 milligrams of crack (or 25 grams of powder), to 38, for offenses involving more than 1.5 kilograms of crack (or 150 kilograms of powder). USSG § 2D1.1(c).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*568</span> B</h2>\n<p>Although the Commission immediately used the 100  to  1 ratio to define base offense levels for all crack and powder offenses, it later determined that the crack/powder sentencing disparity is generally unwarranted. Based on additional research and experience with the 100  to  1 ratio, the Commission concluded that the disparity \"fails to meet the sentencing objectives set forth by Congress in both the Sentencing Reform Act and the 1986 Act.\" 2002 Report 91. In a series of reports, the Commission identified three problems with the crack/powder disparity.</p>\n<p>First, the Commission reported, the 100  to  1 ratio rested on assumptions about \"the relative harmfulness of the two drugs and the relative prevalence of certain harmful conduct associated with their use and distribution that more recent research and data no longer support.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 8 (May 2007), available at http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/ cocaine2007.pdf (hereinafter 2007 Report) (ratio Congress embedded in the statute far \"overstate[s]\" both \"the relative harmfulness\" of crack cocaine, and the \"seriousness of most crack cocaine offenses\"). For example, the Commission found that crack is associated with \"significantly less trafficking-related violence ... than previously assumed.\" 2002 Report 100. It also observed that \"the negative effects of prenatal crack cocaine exposure are identical to the negative effects of prenatal powder cocaine exposure.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 94. The Commission furthermore noted that \"the epidemic of crack cocaine use by youth never materialized to the extent feared.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 96.</p>\n<p>Second, the Commission concluded that the crack/powder disparity is inconsistent with the 1986 Act's goal of punishing major drug traffickers more severely than low-level dealers. Drug importers and major traffickers generally deal in powder cocaine, which is then converted into crack by street-level sellers. See 1995 Report 66-67. But the 100  to  1 ratio can lead to the \"anomalous\" result that \"retail crack dealers get longer sentences than the wholesale drug distributors who supply them the powder cocaine from which their crack is produced.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 174.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Commission stated that the crack/powder sentencing differential \"fosters disrespect for and lack of confidence in the criminal justice system\" because of a \"widely-held perception\" that it \"promotes unwarranted disparity based on race.\" 2002 Report 103. Approximately 85 percent of defendants convicted of crack offenses in federal court are black; thus the severe sentences required by the 100  to  1 ratio are imposed \"primarily upon black offenders.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Despite these observations, the Commission's most recent reports do not urge identical treatment of crack and powder cocaine. In the Commission's view, \"some differential in the quantity-based penalties\" for the two drugs is warranted, <i>id.,</i> at 102, because crack is more addictive than powder, crack offenses are more likely to involve weapons or bodily injury, and crack distribution is associated with higher levels of crime, see <i>id.,</i> at 93-94, 101-102. But the 100  to  1 crack/powder ratio, the Commission concluded, significantly overstates the differences between the two forms of the drug. Accordingly, the Commission recommended that the ratio be \"substantially\" reduced. <i>Id.,</i> at viii.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*569</span> C</h2>\n<p>The Commission has several times sought to achieve a reduction in the crack/powder ratio. In 1995, it proposed amendments to the Guidelines that would have replaced the 100  to  1 ratio with a 1  to  1 ratio. Complementing that change, the Commission would have installed special enhancements for trafficking offenses involving weapons or bodily injury. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 60 Fed.Reg. 25075-25077 (1995). Congress, acting pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 994(p),<sup>[9]</sup> rejected the amendments. See Pub.L. 104-38, § 1, 109 Stat. 334. Simultaneously, however, Congress directed the Commission to \"propose revision of the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine under the relevant statutes and guidelines.\" § 2(a)(2), <i>id.,</i> at 335.</p>\n<p>In response to this directive, the Commission issued reports in 1997 and 2002 recommending that Congress change the 100  to  1 ratio prescribed in the 1986 Act. The 1997 Report proposed a 5  to  1 ratio. See United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 2 (Apr. 1997), http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/newcrack.pdf. The 2002 Report recommended lowering the ratio \"at least\" to 20 to 1. 2002 Report viii. Neither proposal prompted congressional action.</p>\n<p>The Commission's most recent report, issued in 2007, again urged Congress to amend the 1986 Act to reduce the 100  to  1 ratio. This time, however, the Commission did not simply await congressional action. Instead, the Commission adopted an ameliorating change in the Guidelines. See 2007 Report 9. The alteration, which became effective on November 1, 2007, reduces the base offense level associated with each quantity of crack by two levels. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed. Reg. 28571-28572 (2007).<sup>[10]</sup> This modest amendment yields sentences for crack offenses between two and five times longer than sentences for equal amounts of powder. See <i>ibid.</i><sup>[11]</sup> Describing the amendment as \"only ... a partial remedy\" for the problems generated by the crack/powder disparity, the Commission noted that \"[a]ny comprehensive solution requires appropriate legislative action by Congress.\" 2007 Report 10.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>With this history of the crack/powder sentencing ratio in mind, we next consider the status of the Guidelines tied to the ratio after our decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <i>Booker,</i> the Court held that the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines <span class=\"star-pagination\">*570</span> system violated the Sixth Amendment. See <i>id.,</i> at 226-227, 125 S.Ct. 738. The <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion determined that the appropriate cure was to sever and excise the provision of the statute that rendered the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).<sup>[12]</sup> This modification of the federal sentencing statute, we explained, \"makes the Guidelines effectively advisory.\" 543 U.S., at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>The statute, as modified by <i>Booker,</i> contains an overarching provision instructing district courts to \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" to accomplish the goals of sentencing, including \"to reflect the seriousness of the offense,\" \"to promote respect for the law,\" \"to provide just punishment for the offense,\" \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" and \"to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The statute further provides that, in determining the appropriate sentence, the court should consider a number of factors, including \"the nature and circumstances of the offense,\" \"the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" \"the sentencing range established\" by the Guidelines, \"any pertinent policy statement\" issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to its statutory authority, and \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\" <i>Ibid.</i> In sum, while the statute still requires a court to give respectful consideration to the Guidelines, see <i>Gall v. United States</i><i>, ante,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, at 594, 596, 2007 WL 4292116, <i>Booker</i> \"permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well,\" 543 U.S., at 245-246, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>The Government acknowledges that the Guidelines \"are now advisory\" and that, as a general matter, \"courts may vary [from Guidelines ranges] based solely on policy considerations, including disagreements with the Guidelines.\" Brief for United States 16; cf. <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (a district court may consider arguments that \"the Guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect § 3553(a) considerations\"). But the Government contends that the Guidelines adopting the 100  to  1 ratio are an exception to the \"general freedom that sentencing courts have to apply the [§ 3553(a)] factors.\" Brief for United States 16. That is so, according to the Government, because the ratio is a \"specific policy determinatio[n] that Congress has directed sentencing courts to observe.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 25. The Government offers three arguments in support of this position. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As its first and most heavily pressed argument, the Government urges that the 1986 Act itself prohibits the Sentencing Commission and sentencing courts from disagreeing with the 100  to  1 ratio.<sup>[13]</sup> The Government acknowledges that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*571</span> the \"Congress did not <i>expressly</i> direct the Sentencing Commission to incorporate the 100:1 ratio in the Guidelines.\" Brief for United States 33 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, it asserts that the Act \"[i]mplicit[ly]\" requires the Commission and sentencing courts to apply the 100  to  1 ratio. <i>Id.,</i> at 32. Any deviation, the Government urges, would be \"logically incoherent\" when combined with mandatory minimum sentences based on the 100  to  1 ratio. <i>Id.,</i> at 33.</p>\n<p>This argument encounters a formidable obstacle: It lacks grounding in the text of the 1986 Act. The statute, by its terms, mandates only maximum and minimum sentences: A person convicted of possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of crack cocaine must be sentenced to a minimum of 5 years and the maximum term is 40 years. A person with 50 grams or more of crack cocaine must be sentenced to a minimum of 10 years and the maximum term is life. The statute says nothing about the appropriate sentences within these brackets, and we decline to read any implicit directive into that congressional silence. See <i>Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,</i> 543 U.S. 335, 341, 125 S.Ct. 694, 160 L.Ed.2d 708 (2005) (\"We do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply ....\"). Drawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate here, for Congress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms. For example, Congress has specifically required the Sentencing Commission to set Guidelines sentences for serious recidivist offenders \"at or near\" the statutory maximum. 28 U.S.C. § 994(h). See also § 994(i) (\"The Commission shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a substantial term of imprisonment\" for specified categories of offenders.).</p>\n<p>Our cautious reading of the 1986 Act draws force from <i>Neal v. United States,</i> 516 U.S. 284, 116 S.Ct. 763, 133 L.Ed.2d 709 (1996). That case involved different methods of calculating lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) weights, one applicable in determining statutory minimum sentences, the other controlling the calculation of Guidelines ranges. The 1986 Act sets mandatory minimum sentences based on the weight of \"a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" of LSD. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(v), (B)(v). Prior to <i>Neal,</i> we had interpreted that language to include the weight of the carrier medium (usually blotter paper) on which LSD is absorbed even though the carrier is usually far heavier than the LSD itself. See <i>Chapman v. United States,</i> 500 U.S. 453, 468, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991). Until 1993, the Sentencing Commission had interpreted the relevant Guidelines in the same way. That year, however, the Commission changed its approach and \"instructed courts to give each dose of LSD on a carrier medium a constructive or presumed weight of 0.4 milligrams.\" <i>Neal,</i> 516 U.S., at 287, 116 S.Ct. 763 (citing USSG § 2D1.1(c), n. (H) (Nov. 1995)). The Commission's change significantly lowered the Guidelines range applicable to most LSD offenses, but defendants remained subject to higher statutory minimum sentences based on the combined weight of the pure drug and its carrier medium. The defendant in <i>Neal</i> argued that the revised Guidelines and the statute should be interpreted consistently and that the \"presumptive-weight method of the Guidelines should also control the mandatory minimum calculation.\" 516 U.S., at 287, 116 S.Ct. 763. We rejected that argument, emphasizing that the Commission had not purported to interpret the statute and could not in any event overrule our <span class=\"star-pagination\">*572</span> decision in <i>Chapman.</i> See 516 U.S., at 293-295, 116 S.Ct. 763.</p>\n<p>If the Government's current position were correct, then the Guidelines involved in <i>Neal</i> would be in serious jeopardy. We have just recounted the reasons alleged to justify reading into the 1986 Act an implicit command to the Commission and sentencing courts to apply the 100  to  1 ratio to all quantities of crack cocaine. Those same reasons could be urged in support of an argument that the 1986 Act requires the Commission to include the full weight of the carrier medium in calculating the weight of LSD for Guidelines purposes. Yet our opinion in <i>Neal</i> never questioned the validity of the altered Guidelines. To the contrary, we stated: \"Entrusted within its sphere to make policy judgments, the Commission may abandon its old methods in favor of what it has deemed a more desirable `approach' to calculating LSD quantities.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 295, 116 S.Ct. 763.<sup>[14]</sup> If the 1986 Act does not require the Commission to adhere to the Act's method for determining LSD weights, it does not require the Commission  or, after <i>Booker,</i> sentencing courts  to adhere to the 100  to  1 ratio for crack cocaine quantities other than those that trigger the statutory mandatory minimum sentences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In addition to the 1986 Act, the Government relies on Congress' disapproval of the Guidelines amendment that the Sentencing Commission proposed in 1995. Congress \"not only disapproved of the 1:1 ratio,\" the Government urges; it also made clear \"that the 1986 Act required the Commission (and sentencing courts) to take drug quantities into account, and to do so in a manner that respects the 100:1 ratio.\" Brief for United States 35.</p>\n<p>It is true that Congress rejected the Commission's 1995 proposal to place a 1  to  1 ratio in the Guidelines, and that Congress also expressed the view that \"the sentence imposed for trafficking in a quantity of crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence imposed for trafficking in a like quantity of powder cocaine.\" Pub.L. 104-38, § 2(a)(1)(A), 109 Stat. 334. But nothing in Congress' 1995 reaction to the Commission-proposed 1 to  1 ratio suggested that crack sentences must exceed powder sentences by a ratio of 100 to 1. To the contrary, Congress' 1995 action required the Commission to recommend a \"revision of the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine.\" § 2(a)(2), <i>id.,</i> at 335.</p>\n<p>The Government emphasizes that Congress required the Commission to propose changes to the 100  to  1 ratio in <i>both</i> the 1986 Act and the Guidelines. This requirement, the Government contends, implicitly foreclosed any deviation from the 100  to  1 ratio in the Guidelines (or by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*573</span> sentencing courts) in the absence of a corresponding change in the statute. See Brief for United States 35-36. But it does not follow as the night follows the day that, by calling for recommendations to change the statute, Congress meant to bar any Guidelines alteration in advance of congressional action. The more likely reading is that Congress sought proposals to amend both the statute and the Guidelines because the Commission's criticisms of the 100  to  1 ratio, see Part II-B, <i>supra,</i> concerned the exorbitance of the crack/powder disparity in both contexts.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as a result of the 2007 amendment, see <i>supra,</i> at 569, the Guidelines now advance a crack/powder ratio that varies (at different offense levels) between 25 to 1 and 80 to 1. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed.Reg. 28571-28572. Adopting the Government's analysis, the amended Guidelines would conflict with Congress' 1995 action, and with the 1986 Act, because the current Guidelines ratios deviate from the 100  to  1 statutory ratio. Congress, however, did not disapprove or modify the Commission-initiated 2007 amendment. Ordinarily, we resist reading congressional intent into congressional inaction. See <i>Bob Jones Univ. v. United States,</i> 461 U.S. 574, 600, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983). But in this case, Congress failed to act on a proposed amendment to the Guidelines in a high-profile area in which it had previously exercised its disapproval authority under 28 U.S.C. § 994(p). If nothing else, this tacit acceptance of the 2007 amendment undermines the Government's position, which is itself based on implications drawn from congressional silence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Finally, the Government argues that if district courts are free to deviate from the Guidelines based on disagreements with the crack/powder ratio, unwarranted disparities of two kinds will ensue. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6) (sentencing courts shall consider \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\"). First, because sentencing courts remain bound by the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed in the 1986 Act, deviations from the 100  to  1 ratio could result in sentencing \"cliffs\" around quantities that trigger the mandatory minimums. Brief for United States 33 (internal quotation marks omitted). For example, a district court could grant a sizable downward variance to a defendant convicted of distributing 49 grams of crack but would be required by the statutory minimum to impose a much higher sentence on a defendant responsible for only 1 additional gram. Second, the Government maintains that, if district courts are permitted to vary from the Guidelines based on their disagreement with the crack/powder disparity, \"defendants with identical real conduct will receive markedly different sentences, depending on nothing more than the particular judge drawn for sentencing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 40.</p>\n<p>Neither of these arguments persuades us to hold the crack/powder ratio untouchable by sentencing courts. As to the first, the LSD Guidelines we approved in <i>Neal</i> create a similar risk of sentencing \"cliffs.\" An offender who possesses LSD on a carrier medium weighing ten grams is subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(v), but an offender whose carrier medium weighs slightly less may receive a considerably lower sentence based on the Guidelines' presumptive-weight methodology. Concerning the second disparity, it is unquestioned that uniformity remains an important goal of sentencing. As we explained in <i>Booker,</i> however, advisory Guidelines combined with appellate review for reasonableness <span class=\"star-pagination\">*574</span> and ongoing revision of the Guidelines in response to sentencing practices will help to \"avoid excessive sentencing disparities.\" 543 U.S., at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. These measures will not eliminate variations between district courts, but our opinion in <i>Booker</i> recognized that some departures from uniformity were a necessary cost of the remedy we adopted. See <i>id.,</i> at 263, 125 S.Ct. 738 (\"We cannot and do not claim that use of a `reasonableness' standard will provide the uniformity that Congress originally sought to secure [through mandatory Guidelines].\"). And as to crack cocaine sentences in particular, we note a congressional control on disparities: possible variations among district courts are constrained by the mandatory minimums Congress prescribed in the 1986 Act.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, to the extent that the Government correctly identifies risks of \"unwarranted sentence disparities\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 3353(a)(6), the proper solution is not to treat the crack/powder ratio as mandatory. Section 3553(a)(6) directs <i>district courts</i> to consider the need to avoid unwarranted disparities  along with other § 3553(a) factors  when imposing sentences. See <i>Gall, ante,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, n. 6, ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, at 596-597, n. 6, 599, 2007 WL 4292116. Under this instruction, district courts must take account of sentencing practices in other courts and the \"cliffs\" resulting from the statutory mandatory minimum sentences. To reach an appropriate sentence, these disparities must be weighed against the other § 3553(a) factors and any unwarranted disparity created by the crack/powder ratio itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>While rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 245, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we have nevertheless preserved a key role for the Sentencing Commission. As explained in <i>Rita</i> and <i>Gall,</i> district courts must treat the Guidelines as the \"starting point and the initial benchmark,\" <i>Gall v. United States, ante,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 2007 WL 4292116. Congress established the Commission to formulate and constantly refine national sentencing standards. See <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464-2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Carrying out its charge, the Commission fills an important institutional role: It has the capacity courts lack to \"base its determinations on empirical data and national experience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate expertise.\" <i>United States v. Pruitt,</i> 502 F.3d 1154, 1171 (C.A.10 2007) (McConnell, J., concurring); see <i>supra,</i> at 1171.</p>\n<p>We have accordingly recognized that, in the ordinary case, the Commission's recommendation of a sentencing range will \"reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve § 3553(a)'s objectives.\" <i>Rita,</i> 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2465. The sentencing judge, on the other hand, has \"greater familiarity with ... the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the Commission or the appeals court.\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2469. He is therefore \"in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under § 3353(a)\" in each particular case. <i>Gall, ante,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 2007 WL 4292116 (internal quotation marks omitted). In light of these discrete institutional strengths, a district court's decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may <span class=\"star-pagination\">*575</span> attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case \"outside the `heartland' to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.\" <i>Rita,</i> 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2465. On the other hand, while the Guidelines are no longer binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge's view that the Guidelines range \"fails properly to reflect § 3553(a) considerations\" even in a mine-run case. <i>Ibid.</i> Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. in <i>Gall v. United States</i><i>,</i> O.T.2007, No. 06-7949, pp. 38-39.</p>\n<p>The crack cocaine Guidelines, however, present no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter because those Guidelines do not exemplify the Commission's exercise of its characteristic institutional role. In formulating Guidelines ranges for crack cocaine offenses, as we earlier noted, the Commission looked to the mandatory minimum sentences set in the 1986 Act, and did not take account of \"empirical data and national experience.\" See <i>Pruitt,</i> 502 F.3d, at 1171 (McConnell, J., concurring). Indeed, the Commission itself has reported that the crack/powder disparity produces disproportionately harsh sanctions, <i>i.e.,</i> sentences for crack cocaine offenses \"greater than necessary\" in light of the purposes of sentencing set forth in § 3553(a). See <i>supra,</i> at 568. Given all this, it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \"greater than necessary\" to achieve § 3553(a)'s purposes, even in a mine-run case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Taking account of the foregoing discussion in appraising the District Court's disposition in this case, we conclude that the 180-month sentence imposed on Kimbrough should survive appellate inspection. The District Court began by properly calculating and considering the advisory Guidelines range. It then addressed the relevant § 3553(a) factors. First, the court considered \"the nature and circumstances\" of the crime, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1), which was an unremarkable drug-trafficking offense. App. 72-73 (\"[T]his defendant and another defendant were caught sitting in a car with some crack cocaine and powder by two police officers  that's the sum and substance of it  [and they also had] a firearm.\"). Second, the court considered Kimbrough's \"history and characteristics.\" § 3553(a)(1). The court noted that Kimbrough had no prior felony convictions, that he had served in combat during Operation Desert Storm and received an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps, and that he had a steady history of employment.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the court alluded to the Sentencing Commission's reports criticizing the 100  to  1 ratio, cf. § 3553(a)(5) (Supp. V), noting that the Commission \"recognizes that crack cocaine has not caused the damage that the Justice Department alleges it has.\" App. 72. Comparing the Guidelines range to the range that would have applied if Kimbrough had possessed an equal amount of powder, the court suggested that the 100  to  1 ratio itself created an unwarranted disparity within the meaning of § 3553(a). Finally, the court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own. Rather, it appropriately framed its final determination in line with § 3553(a)'s overarching instruction to \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in § 3553(a)(2). See <i>supra,</i> at 570. Concluding that \"the crack cocaine guidelines [drove] the offense level to a point higher than is necessary to do justice in this case,\" App. 72, the District Court thus rested its sentence on the appropriate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*576</span> considerations and \"committed no procedural error,\" <i>Gall v. United States, ante,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, at 600, 2007 WL 4292116.</p>\n<p>The ultimate question in Kimbrough's case is \"whether the sentence was reasonable  <i>i.e.,</i> whether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the § 3553(a) factors supported a sentence of [15 years] and justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The sentence the District Court imposed on Kimbrough was 4.5 years below the bottom of the Guidelines range. But in determining that 15 years was the appropriate prison term, the District Court properly homed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbrough's case and accorded weight to the Sentencing Commission's consistent and emphatic position that the crack/powder disparity is at odds with § 3553(a). See Part II-B, <i>supra.</i> Indeed, aside from its claim that the 100  to  1 ratio is mandatory, the Government did not attack the District Court's downward variance as unsupported by § 3553(a). Giving due respect to the District Court's reasoned appraisal, a reviewing court could not rationally conclude that the 4.5-year sentence reduction Kimbrough received qualified as an abuse of discretion. See <i>Gall, ante,</i> at ___ - ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, at 601-602; <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469-2470, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, concurring.</p>\n<p>The Court says that \"closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge's view that the Guidelines range 'fails properly to reflect § 3553(a) considerations' even in a mine-run case,\" but that this case \"present[s] no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter.\" <i>Ante,</i> at ___ (quoting <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). I join the opinion only because I do not take this to be an unannounced abandonment of the following clear statements in our recent opinions:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Our remedial opinion] requires a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges, ... but it permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well, see § 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[W]ithout this provision  namely the provision that makes `the relevant sentencing rules ... mandatory and impose[s] binding requirements on all sentencing judges'  the statute falls outside the scope of requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\" <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 245-246, 259, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Under the system described in Justice BREYER's opinion for the Court in <i>Booker,</i> judges would no longer be tied to the sentencing range indicated in the Guidelines. But they would be obliged to `take account of' that range along with the sentencing goals Congress enumerated in the SRA at 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\" <i>Cunningham v. California,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 856, 867, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*577</span> \"[The sentencing judge] may hear arguments by prosecution or defense that the Guidelines sentence should not apply, perhaps because (as the Guidelines themselves foresee) the case at hand falls outside the `heartland' to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply, USSG § 5K2.0, perhaps because the Guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect § 3553(a) considerations, or perhaps because the case warrants a different sentence regardless.

Still less does it <i>forbid</i> the sentencing judge from imposing a sentence higher than the Guidelines provide for the jury-determined facts standing alone. As far as the law is concerned, the judge could disregard the Guidelines and apply the same sentence (higher than the statutory minimum or the bottom of the unenhanced Guidelines range) in the absence of the special facts (say, gun brandishing) which, in the view of the Sentencing Commission, would warrant a higher sentence within the statutorily permissible range.\" <i>Rita, supra,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2465.</blockquote>\n<p>These statements mean that the district court is free to make its own reasonable application of the § 3553(a) factors, and to reject (after due consideration) the advice of the Guidelines. If there is any thumb on the scales; if the Guidelines <i>must</i> be followed even where the district court's application of the § 3553(a) factors is entirely reasonable; then the \"advisory\" Guidelines would, over a large expanse of their application, <i>entitle</i> the defendant to a lesser sentence <i>but for</i> the presence of certain additional facts found by judge rather than jury. This, as we said in <i>Booker,</i> would violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I continue to disagree with the remedy fashioned in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 258-265, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Court's post-<i>Booker</i> sentencing cases illustrate why the remedial majority in <i>Booker</i> was mistaken to craft a remedy far broader than necessary to correct constitutional error. The Court is now confronted with a host of questions about how to administer a sentencing scheme that has no basis in the statute. Because the Court's decisions in this area are necessarily grounded in policy considerations rather than law, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>In <i>Booker,</i> the Court held that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines violate the Sixth Amendment insofar as they permit a judge to make findings that raise a sentence beyond the level justified by the \"`facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 232, 125 S.Ct. 738 (quoting <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (emphasis deleted)). In my view, this violation was more suitably remedied by requiring any such facts to be submitted to the jury. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 323-325, 125 S.Ct. 738 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in part). That approach would have been consistent with our longstanding presumption of the severability of unconstitutional applications of statutory provisions. <i>Id.,</i> at 322-323, 125 S.Ct. 738 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in part). And it would have achieved compliance with the Sixth Amendment while doing the least amount of violence to the mandatory sentencing regime that Congress enacted. <i>Id.,</i> at 324-326, 125 S.Ct. 738 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in part). The Court, however, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*578</span> chose a more sweeping remedy. Despite acknowledging that under the mandatory Guidelines not \"every sentence gives rise to a Sixth Amendment violation,\" the Court rendered the Guidelines advisory in their entirety and mandated appellate review of all sentences for \"reasonableness.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 268, 125 S.Ct. 738. Because the Court's \"solution fail[ed] to tailor the remedy to the wrong,\" I dissented from the remedial opinion. <i>Id.,</i> at 313, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>As a result of the Court's remedial approach, we are now called upon to decide a multiplicity of questions that have no discernibly legal answers. Last Term, in <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), the Court held that a Court of Appeals may treat sentences within the properly calculated Guidelines range as presumptively reasonable. Today, in <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445, 2007 WL 4292116, the Court holds that a Court of Appeals may not require sentences that deviate substantially from the Guidelines range to be justified by extraordinary circumstances. And here the Court holds that sentencing courts are free to reject the Sentencing Guidelines' 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio.</p>\n<p>These outcomes may be perfectly reasonable as a matter of policy, but they have no basis in law. Congress did not mandate a reasonableness standard of appellate review  that was a standard the remedial majority in <i>Booker</i> fashioned out of whole cloth. See 543 U.S., at 307-312, 125 S.Ct. 738 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part). The Court must now give content to that standard, but in so doing it does not and cannot rely on any statutory language or congressional intent. We are asked here to determine whether, under the new advisory Guidelines regime, district courts may impose sentences based in part on their disagreement with a categorical policy judgment reflected in the Guidelines. But the Court's answer to that question necessarily derives from something other than the statutory language or congressional intent because Congress, by making the Guidelines mandatory, quite clearly intended to bind district courts to the Sentencing Commission's categorical policy judgments. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (excised by <i>Booker).</i> By rejecting this statutory approach, the <i>Booker</i> remedial majority has left the Court with no law to apply and forced it to assume the legislative role of devising a new sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p>Although I joined Justice SCALIA's dissent in <i>Rita</i> accepting the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion as a matter of \"statutory <i>stare decisis,\"</i> 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2475, I am now convinced that there is no principled way to apply the <i>Booker</i> remedy  certainly not one based on the statute. Accordingly, I think it best to apply the statute as written, including 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b), which makes the Guidelines mandatory. Cf. <i>Dickerson v. United States,</i> 530 U.S. 428, 465, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Applying the statute as written, it is clear that the District Court erred by departing below the mandatory Guidelines range. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals vacating petitioner's sentence and remanding for resentencing.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, dissenting.</p>\n<p>For the reasons explained in my dissent in <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445, 2007 WL 4292116, I would hold that, under the remedial decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 258-265, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district judge is still <span class=\"star-pagination\">*579</span> required to give significant weight to the policy decisions embodied in the Guidelines. The <i>Booker</i> remedial decision, however, does not permit a court of appeals to treat the Guidelines' policy decisions as binding. I would not draw a distinction between the Guideline at issue here and other Guidelines. Accordingly, I would vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The statutory range for possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack is ten years to life. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The same range applies to the conspiracy offense. See § 846 (2000 ed.). The statutory range for possession with intent to distribute powder cocaine is 0 to 20 years. See § 841(b)(1)(C) (Supp.V). Finally, the statutory range for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense is five years to life. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i).

See 1995 Report 18.</p>\n<p>[6]  As explained in Part II-C, <i>infra,</i> the Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines and reduced sentences for crack offenses effective November 1, 2007. Except as noted, this opinion refers to the 2004 Guidelines in effect at the time of Kimbrough's sentencing.</p>\n<p>[7]  Congress created the Sentencing Commission and charged it with promulgating the Guidelines in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987, 18 U.S.C. § 3551 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. V), but the first version of the Guidelines did not become operative until November 1987, see 1995 Report ii-iv.</p>\n<p>[8]  An offense level of 12 results in a Guidelines range of 10 to 16 months for a first-time offender; an offense level of 38 results in a range of 235 to 293 months for the same offender. See USSG ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table.</p>\n<p>[9]  Subsection 994(p) requires the Commission to submit Guidelines amendments to Congress and provides that such amendments become effective unless \"modified or disapproved by Act of Congress.\"</p>\n<p>[10]  The amended Guidelines still produce sentencing ranges keyed to the mandatory minimums in the 1986 Act. Under the pre-2007 Guidelines, the 5- and 50-gram quantities that trigger the statutory minimums produced sentencing ranges that slightly <i>exceeded</i> those statutory minimums. Under the amended Guidelines, in contrast, the 5- and 50-gram quantities produce \"base offense levels corresponding to guideline ranges that <i>include</i> the statutory mandatory minimum penalties.\" 2007 Report 9.</p>\n<p>[11]  The Commission has not yet determined whether the amendment will be retroactive to cover defendants like Kimbrough. Even under the amendment, however, Kimbrough's Guidelines range would be 195 to 218 months  well above the 180-month sentence imposed by the District Court. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed.Reg. 28571-28572 (2007); USSG ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table.</p>\n<p>[12]  The remedial opinion also severed and excised the provision of the statute requiring <i>de novo</i> review of departures from the Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e), because that provision depended on the Guidelines' mandatory status. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>[13]  The Government concedes that a district court may vary from the 100  to  1 ratio if it does so \"based on the individualized circumstance[s]\" of a particular case. Brief for United States 45. But the Government maintains that the 100  to  1 ratio is binding in the sense that a court may not give any weight to its own view that the ratio itself is inconsistent with the § 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p>[14]  At oral argument, the Government sought to distinguish <i>Neal v. United States,</i> 516 U.S. 284, 116 S.Ct. 763, 133 L.Ed.2d 709 (1996), on the ground that the validity of the amended Guidelines was not before us in that case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 25. That is true, but only because the Government did not challenge the amendment. In fact, the Government's brief appeared to acknowledge that the Commission may legitimately deviate from the policies and methods embodied in the 1986 Act, even if the deviation produces some inconsistency. See Brief for United States in <i>Neal v. United States</i><i>,</i> O.T.1995, No. 94-9088, p. 26 (\"When the Commission's views about sentencing policy depart from those of Congress, it may become difficult to achieve entirely consistent sentencing, but that is a matter for Congress, not the courts, to address.\"). Moreover, our opinion in <i>Neal</i> assumed that the amendment was a legitimate exercise of the Commission's authority. See 516 U.S., at 294, 116 S.Ct. 763 (noting with apparent approval the Commission's position that \"the Guidelines calculation is independent of the statutory calculation\").</p>\n<p>[15]  The Sentencing Commission reports that roughly 70% of crack offenders are responsible for drug quantities that yield base offense levels at or only two levels above those that correspond to the statutory minimums.

In accord with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), the Guidelines, formerly mandatory, now serve as one factor among several courts must consider in determining an appropriate sentence. <i>Booker</i> further instructed that \"reasonableness\" is the standard controlling appellate review of the sentences district courts impose.</p>\n<p>Under the statute criminalizing the manufacture and distribution of crack cocaine, 21 U.S.C. § 841, and the relevant Guidelines prescription, § 2D1.1, a drug trafficker dealing in crack cocaine is subject to the same sentence as one dealing in 100 times more powder cocaine. The question here presented is whether, as the Court of Appeals held in this case, \"a sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\" 174 Fed.Appx. 798, 799 (C.A.4 2006) <i>(per curiam).</i> We hold that, under <i>Booker,</i> the cocaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only, and that the Court of Appeals erred in holding the crack/powder disparity effectively mandatory. A district judge must include the Guidelines range in the array of factors warranting consideration. The judge may determine, however, that, in the particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is \"greater than necessary\" to serve the objectives of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). In making that determination, the judge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines' treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In September 2004, petitioner Derrick Kimbrough was indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and charged with four offenses: conspiracy to distribute crack and powder cocaine; possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine; possession with intent to distribute powder cocaine; and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drugtrafficking offense. Kimbrough pleaded guilty to all four charges.</p>\n<p>Under the relevant statutes, Kimbrough's plea subjected him to an aggregate sentence of 15 years to life in prison: 10 years to life for the three drug offenses, plus a consecutive term of 5 years to life for the firearm offense.<sup>[1]</sup> In order to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*565</span> the appropriate sentence within this statutory range, the District Court first calculated Kimbrough's sentence under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines.<sup>[2]</sup> Kimbrough's guilty plea acknowledged that he was accountable for 56 grams of crack cocaine and 92.1 grams of powder cocaine. This quantity of drugs yielded a base offense level of 32 for the three drug charges. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 2D1.1(c) (Nov.2004) (USSG). Finding that Kimbrough, by asserting sole culpability for the crime, had testified falsely at his codefendant's trial, the District Court increased his offense level to 34. See § 3C1.1. In accord with the presentence report, the court determined that Kimbrough's criminal history category was II. An offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of II yielded a Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months for the three drug charges. See <i>id.,</i> ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. The Guidelines sentence for the firearm offense was the statutory minimum, 60 months. See USSG § 2K2.4(b). Kimbrough's final advisory Guidelines range was thus 228 to 270 months, or 19 to 22.5 years.</p>\n<p>A sentence in this range, in the District Court's judgment, would have been \"greater than necessary\" to accomplish the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). App. 72. As required by § 3553(a), the court took into account the \"nature and circumstances\" of the offense and Kimbrough's \"history and characteristics.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 72-73. The court also commented that the case exemplified the \"disproportionate and unjust effect that crack cocaine guidelines have in sentencing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 72. In this regard, the court contrasted Kimbrough's Guidelines range of 228 to 270 months with the range that would have applied had he been accountable for an equivalent amount of powder cocaine: 97 to 106 months, inclusive of the 5-year mandatory minimum for the firearm charge, see USSG § 2D1.1(c); <i>id.,</i> ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. Concluding that the statutory minimum sentence was \"clearly long enough\" to accomplish the objectives listed in § 3553(a), the court sentenced Kimbrough to 15 years, or 180 months, in prison plus 5 years of supervised release. App. 74-75.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In an unpublished <i>per curiam</i> opinion, the Fourth Circuit vacated the sentence. Under Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals observed, a sentence \"outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\" 174 Fed.Appx., at 799 (citing <i>United States v.

Crack and powder cocaine are two forms of the same drug. Powder cocaine, or cocaine hydrochloride, is generally inhaled through the nose; it may also be mixed with water and injected. See United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 5, 12 (Feb.1995), available at http://www.ussc.gov/crack/exec.htm (hereinafter 1995 Report). (All Internet materials as visited Dec. 7, 2007, and included in Clerk of Court's case file.) Crack cocaine, a type of cocaine base, is formed by dissolving powder cocaine and baking soda in boiling water. <i>Id.,</i> at 14. The resulting solid is divided into single-dose \"rocks\" that users smoke. <i>Ibid.</i> The active ingredient in powder and crack cocaine is the same. <i>Id.,</i> at 9. The two forms of the drug also have the same physiological and psychotropic effects, but smoking crack cocaine allows the body to absorb the drug much faster than inhaling powder cocaine, and thus produces a shorter, more intense high. <i>Id.,</i> at 15-19.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Although chemically similar, crack and powder cocaine are handled very differently for sentencing purposes. The 100  to  1 ratio yields sentences for crack offenses three to six times longer than those for powder offenses involving equal amounts of drugs. See United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy iv (May 2002), available at http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/02crack/ 2002crackrpt.pdf (hereinafter 2002 Report).<sup>[6]</sup> This disparity means that a major supplier of powder cocaine may receive a shorter sentence than a low-level dealer who buys powder from the supplier but then converts it to crack. See 1995 Report 193-194.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The crack/powder disparity originated in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (1986 Act), 100 Stat. 3207. The 1986 Act created a two-tiered scheme of five- and ten-year mandatory minimum sentences for drug manufacturing and distribution offenses. Congress sought \"to link the ten-year mandatory minimum trafficking prison term to major drug dealers and to link the five-year minimum term to serious traffickers.\" 1995 Report 119. The 1986 Act uses the weight of the drugs involved in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*567</span> the offense as the sole proxy to identify \"major\" and \"serious\" dealers. For example, any defendant responsible for 100 grams of heroin is subject to the five-year mandatory minimum, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(i) (2000 ed. and Supp V), and any defendant responsible for 1,000 grams of heroin is subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum, see § 841(b)(1)(A)(i).</p>\n<p>Crack cocaine was a relatively new drug when the 1986 Act was signed into law, but it was already a matter of great public concern: \"Drug abuse in general, and crack cocaine in particular, had become in public opinion and in members' minds a problem of overwhelming dimensions.\" 1995 Report 121. Congress apparently believed that crack was significantly more dangerous than powder cocaine in that: (1) crack was highly addictive; (2) crack users and dealers were more likely to be violent than users and dealers of other drugs; (3) crack was more harmful to users than powder, particularly for children who had been exposed by their mothers' drug use during pregnancy; (4) crack use was especially prevalent among teenagers; and (5) crack's potency and low cost were making it increasingly popular. See 2002 Report 90.</p>\n<p>Based on these assumptions, the 1986 Act adopted a \"100  to  1 ratio\" that treated every gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of powder cocaine. The Act's five-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for 5 grams of crack or 500 grams of powder, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(ii), (iii); its ten-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for 50 grams of crack or 5,000 grams of powder, § 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).</p>\n<p>While Congress was considering adoption of the 1986 Act, the Sentencing Commission was engaged in formulating the Sentencing Guidelines.<sup>[7]</sup> In the main, the Commission developed Guidelines sentences using an empirical approach based on data about past sentencing practices, including 10,000 presentence investigation reports. See USSG § 1A.1, intro. comment., pt. A, ¶ 3. The Commission \"modif[ied] and adjust[ed] past practice in the interests of greater rationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with congressional instructions, and the like.\" <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p>The Commission did not use this empirical approach in developing the Guidelines sentences for drug-trafficking offenses. Instead, it employed the 1986 Act's weightdriven scheme. The Guidelines use a drug quantity table based on drug type and weight to set base offense levels for drug trafficking offenses. See USSG § 2D1.1(c). In setting offense levels for crack and powder cocaine, the Commission, in line with the 1986 Act, adopted the 100  to  1 ratio. The statute itself specifies only two quantities of each drug, but the Guidelines \"go further and set sentences for the full range of possible drug quantities using the same 100  to  1 quantity ratio.\" 1995 Report 1. The Guidelines' drug quantity table sets base offense levels ranging from 12, for offenses involving less than 250 milligrams of crack (or 25 grams of powder), to 38, for offenses involving more than 1.5 kilograms of crack (or 150 kilograms of powder). USSG § 2D1.1(c).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*568</span> B</h2>\n<p>Although the Commission immediately used the 100  to  1 ratio to define base offense levels for all crack and powder offenses, it later determined that the crack/powder sentencing disparity is generally unwarranted. Based on additional research and experience with the 100  to  1 ratio, the Commission concluded that the disparity \"fails to meet the sentencing objectives set forth by Congress in both the Sentencing Reform Act and the 1986 Act.\" 2002 Report 91. In a series of reports, the Commission identified three problems with the crack/powder disparity.</p>\n<p>First, the Commission reported, the 100  to  1 ratio rested on assumptions about \"the relative harmfulness of the two drugs and the relative prevalence of certain harmful conduct associated with their use and distribution that more recent research and data no longer support.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 8 (May 2007), available at http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/ cocaine2007.pdf (hereinafter 2007 Report) (ratio Congress embedded in the statute far \"overstate[s]\" both \"the relative harmfulness\" of crack cocaine, and the \"seriousness of most crack cocaine offenses\"). For example, the Commission found that crack is associated with \"significantly less trafficking-related violence ... than previously assumed.\" 2002 Report 100. It also observed that \"the negative effects of prenatal crack cocaine exposure are identical to the negative effects of prenatal powder cocaine exposure.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 94. The Commission furthermore noted that \"the epidemic of crack cocaine use by youth never materialized to the extent feared.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 96.</p>\n<p>Second, the Commission concluded that the crack/powder disparity is inconsistent with the 1986 Act's goal of punishing major drug traffickers more severely than low-level dealers. Drug importers and major traffickers generally deal in powder cocaine, which is then converted into crack by street-level sellers. See 1995 Report 66-67. But the 100  to  1 ratio can lead to the \"anomalous\" result that \"retail crack dealers get longer sentences than the wholesale drug distributors who supply them the powder cocaine from which their crack is produced.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 174.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Commission stated that the crack/powder sentencing differential \"fosters disrespect for and lack of confidence in the criminal justice system\" because of a \"widely-held perception\" that it \"promotes unwarranted disparity based on race.\" 2002 Report 103. Approximately 85 percent of defendants convicted of crack offenses in federal court are black; thus the severe sentences required by the 100  to  1 ratio are imposed \"primarily upon black offenders.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Despite these observations, the Commission's most recent reports do not urge identical treatment of crack and powder cocaine. In the Commission's view, \"some differential in the quantity-based penalties\" for the two drugs is warranted, <i>id.,</i> at 102, because crack is more addictive than powder, crack offenses are more likely to involve weapons or bodily injury, and crack distribution is associated with higher levels of crime, see <i>id.,</i> at 93-94, 101-102. But the 100  to  1 crack/powder ratio, the Commission concluded, significantly overstates the differences between the two forms of the drug. Accordingly, the Commission recommended that the ratio be \"substantially\" reduced. <i>Id.,</i> at viii.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*569</span> C</h2>\n<p>The Commission has several times sought to achieve a reduction in the crack/powder ratio. In 1995, it proposed amendments to the Guidelines that would have replaced the 100  to  1 ratio with a 1  to  1 ratio. Complementing that change, the Commission would have installed special enhancements for trafficking offenses involving weapons or bodily injury. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 60 Fed.Reg. 25075-25077 (1995). Congress, acting pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 994(p),<sup>[9]</sup> rejected the amendments. See Pub.L. 104-38, § 1, 109 Stat. 334. Simultaneously, however, Congress directed the Commission to \"propose revision of the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine under the relevant statutes and guidelines.\" § 2(a)(2), <i>id.,</i> at 335.</p>\n<p>In response to this directive, the Commission issued reports in 1997 and 2002 recommending that Congress change the 100  to  1 ratio prescribed in the 1986 Act. The 1997 Report proposed a 5  to  1 ratio. See United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 2 (Apr. 1997), http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/newcrack.pdf. The 2002 Report recommended lowering the ratio \"at least\" to 20 to 1. 2002 Report viii. Neither proposal prompted congressional action.</p>\n<p>The Commission's most recent report, issued in 2007, again urged Congress to amend the 1986 Act to reduce the 100  to  1 ratio. This time, however, the Commission did not simply await congressional action. Instead, the Commission adopted an ameliorating change in the Guidelines. See 2007 Report 9. The alteration, which became effective on November 1, 2007, reduces the base offense level associated with each quantity of crack by two levels. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed. Reg. 28571-28572 (2007).<sup>[10]</sup> This modest amendment yields sentences for crack offenses between two and five times longer than sentences for equal amounts of powder. See <i>ibid.</i><sup>[11]</sup> Describing the amendment as \"only ... a partial remedy\" for the problems generated by the crack/powder disparity, the Commission noted that \"[a]ny comprehensive solution requires appropriate legislative action by Congress.\" 2007 Report 10.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>With this history of the crack/powder sentencing ratio in mind, we next consider the status of the Guidelines tied to the ratio after our decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"143790\"><a href=\"/opinion/143790/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <i>Booker,</i> the Court held that the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines <span class=\"star-pagination\">*570</span> system violated the Sixth Amendment. See <i>id.,</i> at 226-227, 125 S.Ct. 738. The <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion determined that the appropriate cure was to sever and excise the provision of the statute that rendered the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).<sup>[12]</sup> This modification of the federal sentencing statute, we explained, \"makes the Guidelines effectively advisory.\" 543 U.S., at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>The statute, as modified by <i>Booker,</i> contains an overarching provision instructing district courts to \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" to accomplish the goals of sentencing, including \"to reflect the seriousness of the offense,\" \"to promote respect for the law,\" \"to provide just punishment for the offense,\" \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" and \"to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The statute further provides that, in determining the appropriate sentence, the court should consider a number of factors, including \"the nature and circumstances of the offense,\" \"the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" \"the sentencing range established\" by the Guidelines, \"any pertinent policy statement\" issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to its statutory authority, and \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\" <i>Ibid.</i> In sum, while the statute still requires a court to give respectful consideration to the Guidelines, see <i>Gall v. United States</i><i>, ante,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, at 594, 596, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4292116</span></span>, <i>Booker</i> \"permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well,\" 543 U.S., at 245-246, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>The Government acknowledges that the Guidelines \"are now advisory\" and that, as a general matter, \"courts may vary [from Guidelines ranges] based solely on policy considerations, including disagreements with the Guidelines.\" Brief for United States 16; cf. <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (a district court may consider arguments that \"the Guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect § 3553(a) considerations\"). But the Government contends that the Guidelines adopting the 100  to  1 ratio are an exception to the \"general freedom that sentencing courts have to apply the [§ 3553(a)] factors.\" Brief for United States 16. That is so, according to the Government, because the ratio is a \"specific policy determinatio[n] that Congress has directed sentencing courts to observe.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 25. The Government offers three arguments in support of this position. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As its first and most heavily pressed argument, the Government urges that the 1986 Act itself prohibits the Sentencing Commission and sentencing courts from disagreeing with the 100  to  1 ratio.<sup>[13]</sup> The Government acknowledges that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*571</span> the \"Congress did not <i>expressly</i> direct the Sentencing Commission to incorporate the 100:1 ratio in the Guidelines.\" Brief for United States 33 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, it asserts that the Act \"[i]mplicit[ly]\" requires the Commission and sentencing courts to apply the 100  to  1 ratio. <i>Id.,</i> at 32. Any deviation, the Government urges, would be \"logically incoherent\" when combined with mandatory minimum sentences based on the 100  to  1 ratio. <i>Id.,</i> at 33.</p>\n<p>This argument encounters a formidable obstacle: It lacks grounding in the text of the 1986 Act. The statute, by its terms, mandates only maximum and minimum sentences: A person convicted of possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of crack cocaine must be sentenced to a minimum of 5 years and the maximum term is 40 years. A person with 50 grams or more of crack cocaine must be sentenced to a minimum of 10 years and the maximum term is life. The statute says nothing about the appropriate sentences within these brackets, and we decline to read any implicit directive into that congressional silence. See <i>Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137740\"><a href=\"/opinion/137740/jama-v-immigration-and-customs-enforcement/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 341, 125 S.Ct. 694, 160 L.Ed.2d 708 (2005) (\"We do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply ....\"). Drawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate here, for Congress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms. For example, Congress has specifically required the Sentencing Commission to set Guidelines sentences for serious recidivist offenders \"at or near\" the statutory maximum. 28 U.S.C. § 994(h). See also § 994(i) (\"The Commission shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a substantial term of imprisonment\" for specified categories of offenders.).</p>\n<p>Our cautious reading of the 1986 Act draws force from <i>Neal v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117994\"><a href=\"/opinion/117994/neal-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 116 S.Ct. 763, 133 L.Ed.2d 709 (1996). That case involved different methods of calculating lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) weights, one applicable in determining statutory minimum sentences, the other controlling the calculation of Guidelines ranges. The 1986 Act sets mandatory minimum sentences based on the weight of \"a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" of LSD. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(v), (B)(v). Prior to <i>Neal,</i> we had interpreted that language to include the weight of the carrier medium (usually blotter paper) on which LSD is absorbed even though the carrier is usually far heavier than the LSD itself. See <i>Chapman v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112605\"><a href=\"/opinion/112605/chapman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 468, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991). Until 1993, the Sentencing Commission had interpreted the relevant Guidelines in the same way. That year, however, the Commission changed its approach and \"instructed courts to give each dose of LSD on a carrier medium a constructive or presumed weight of 0.4 milligrams.\" <i>Neal,</i> 516 U.S., at 287, 116 S.Ct. 763 (citing USSG § 2D1.1(c), n. (H) (Nov. 1995)). The Commission's change significantly lowered the Guidelines range applicable to most LSD offenses, but defendants remained subject to higher statutory minimum sentences based on the combined weight of the pure drug and its carrier medium. The defendant in <i>Neal</i> argued that the revised Guidelines and the statute should be interpreted consistently and that the \"presumptive-weight method of the Guidelines should also control the mandatory minimum calculation.\" 516 U.S., at 287, 116 S.Ct. 763. We rejected that argument, emphasizing that the Commission had not purported to interpret the statute and could not in any event overrule our <span class=\"star-pagination\">*572</span> decision in <i>Chapman.</i> See 516 U.S., at 293-295, 116 S.Ct. 763.</p>\n<p>If the Government's current position were correct, then the Guidelines involved in <i>Neal</i> would be in serious jeopardy. We have just recounted the reasons alleged to justify reading into the 1986 Act an implicit command to the Commission and sentencing courts to apply the 100  to  1 ratio to all quantities of crack cocaine. Those same reasons could be urged in support of an argument that the 1986 Act requires the Commission to include the full weight of the carrier medium in calculating the weight of LSD for Guidelines purposes. Yet our opinion in <i>Neal</i> never questioned the validity of the altered Guidelines. To the contrary, we stated: \"Entrusted within its sphere to make policy judgments, the Commission may abandon its old methods in favor of what it has deemed a more desirable `approach' to calculating LSD quantities.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 295, 116 S.Ct. 763.<sup>[14]</sup> If the 1986 Act does not require the Commission to adhere to the Act's method for determining LSD weights, it does not require the Commission  or, after <i>Booker,</i> sentencing courts  to adhere to the 100  to  1 ratio for crack cocaine quantities other than those that trigger the statutory mandatory minimum sentences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In addition to the 1986 Act, the Government relies on Congress' disapproval of the Guidelines amendment that the Sentencing Commission proposed in 1995. Congress \"not only disapproved of the 1:1 ratio,\" the Government urges; it also made clear \"that the 1986 Act required the Commission (and sentencing courts) to take drug quantities into account, and to do so in a manner that respects the 100:1 ratio.\" Brief for United States 35.</p>\n<p>It is true that Congress rejected the Commission's 1995 proposal to place a 1  to  1 ratio in the Guidelines, and that Congress also expressed the view that \"the sentence imposed for trafficking in a quantity of crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence imposed for trafficking in a like quantity of powder cocaine.\" Pub.L. 104-38, § 2(a)(1)(A), 109 Stat. 334. But nothing in Congress' 1995 reaction to the Commission-proposed 1 to  1 ratio suggested that crack sentences must exceed powder sentences by a ratio of 100 to 1. To the contrary, Congress' 1995 action required the Commission to recommend a \"revision of the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine.\" § 2(a)(2), <i>id.,</i> at 335.</p>\n<p>The Government emphasizes that Congress required the Commission to propose changes to the 100  to  1 ratio in <i>both</i> the 1986 Act and the Guidelines. This requirement, the Government contends, implicitly foreclosed any deviation from the 100  to  1 ratio in the Guidelines (or by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*573</span> sentencing courts) in the absence of a corresponding change in the statute. See Brief for United States 35-36. But it does not follow as the night follows the day that, by calling for recommendations to change the statute, Congress meant to bar any Guidelines alteration in advance of congressional action. The more likely reading is that Congress sought proposals to amend both the statute and the Guidelines because the Commission's criticisms of the 100  to  1 ratio, see Part II-B, <i>supra,</i> concerned the exorbitance of the crack/powder disparity in both contexts.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as a result of the 2007 amendment, see <i>supra,</i> at 569, the Guidelines now advance a crack/powder ratio that varies (at different offense levels) between 25 to 1 and 80 to 1. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed.Reg. 28571-28572. Adopting the Government's analysis, the amended Guidelines would conflict with Congress' 1995 action, and with the 1986 Act, because the current Guidelines ratios deviate from the 100  to  1 statutory ratio. Congress, however, did not disapprove or modify the Commission-initiated 2007 amendment. Ordinarily, we resist reading congressional intent into congressional inaction. See <i>Bob Jones Univ. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110938\"><a href=\"/opinion/110938/bob-jones-univ-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span>, 600, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983). But in this case, Congress failed to act on a proposed amendment to the Guidelines in a high-profile area in which it had previously exercised its disapproval authority under 28 U.S.C. § 994(p). If nothing else, this tacit acceptance of the 2007 amendment undermines the Government's position, which is itself based on implications drawn from congressional silence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Finally, the Government argues that if district courts are free to deviate from the Guidelines based on disagreements with the crack/powder ratio, unwarranted disparities of two kinds will ensue. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6) (sentencing courts shall consider \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\"). First, because sentencing courts remain bound by the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed in the 1986 Act, deviations from the 100  to  1 ratio could result in sentencing \"cliffs\" around quantities that trigger the mandatory minimums. Brief for United States 33 (internal quotation marks omitted). For example, a district court could grant a sizable downward variance to a defendant convicted of distributing 49 grams of crack but would be required by the statutory minimum to impose a much higher sentence on a defendant responsible for only 1 additional gram. Second, the Government maintains that, if district courts are permitted to vary from the Guidelines based on their disagreement with the crack/powder disparity, \"defendants with identical real conduct will receive markedly different sentences, depending on nothing more than the particular judge drawn for sentencing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 40.</p>\n<p>Neither of these arguments persuades us to hold the crack/powder ratio untouchable by sentencing courts. As to the first, the LSD Guidelines we approved in <i>Neal</i> create a similar risk of sentencing \"cliffs.\" An offender who possesses LSD on a carrier medium weighing ten grams is subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(v), but an offender whose carrier medium weighs slightly less may receive a considerably lower sentence based on the Guidelines' presumptive-weight methodology. Concerning the second disparity, it is unquestioned that uniformity remains an important goal of sentencing. As we explained in <i>Booker,</i> however, advisory Guidelines combined with appellate review for reasonableness <span class=\"star-pagination\">*574</span> and ongoing revision of the Guidelines in response to sentencing practices will help to \"avoid excessive sentencing disparities.\" 543 U.S., at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. These measures will not eliminate variations between district courts, but our opinion in <i>Booker</i> recognized that some departures from uniformity were a necessary cost of the remedy we adopted. See <i>id.,</i> at 263, 125 S.Ct. 738 (\"We cannot and do not claim that use of a `reasonableness' standard will provide the uniformity that Congress originally sought to secure [through mandatory Guidelines].\"). And as to crack cocaine sentences in particular, we note a congressional control on disparities: possible variations among district courts are constrained by the mandatory minimums Congress prescribed in the 1986 Act.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, to the extent that the Government correctly identifies risks of \"unwarranted sentence disparities\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 3353(a)(6), the proper solution is not to treat the crack/powder ratio as mandatory. Section 3553(a)(6) directs <i>district courts</i> to consider the need to avoid unwarranted disparities  along with other § 3553(a) factors  when imposing sentences. See <i>Gall, ante,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, n. 6, ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, at 596-597, n. 6, 599, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4292116</span></span>. Under this instruction, district courts must take account of sentencing practices in other courts and the \"cliffs\" resulting from the statutory mandatory minimum sentences. To reach an appropriate sentence, these disparities must be weighed against the other § 3553(a) factors and any unwarranted disparity created by the crack/powder ratio itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>While rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"143790\"><a href=\"/opinion/143790/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 245, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we have nevertheless preserved a key role for the Sentencing Commission. As explained in <i>Rita</i> and <i>Gall,</i> district courts must treat the Guidelines as the \"starting point and the initial benchmark,\" <i>Gall v. United States, ante,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4292116</span></span>. Congress established the Commission to formulate and constantly refine national sentencing standards. See <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464-2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Carrying out its charge, the Commission fills an important institutional role: It has the capacity courts lack to \"base its determinations on empirical data and national experience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate expertise.\" <i>United States v. Pruitt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1235999\"><a href=\"/opinion/1235999/united-states-v-pruitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></a></span>, 1171 (C.A.10 2007) (McConnell, J., concurring); see <i>supra,</i> at 1171.</p>\n<p>We have accordingly recognized that, in the ordinary case, the Commission's recommendation of a sentencing range will \"reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve § 3553(a)'s objectives.\" <i>Rita,</i> 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2465. The sentencing judge, on the other hand, has \"greater familiarity with ... the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the Commission or the appeals court.\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2469. He is therefore \"in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under § 3353(a)\" in each particular case. <i>Gall, ante,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4292116</span></span> (internal quotation marks omitted). In light of these discrete institutional strengths, a district court's decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may <span class=\"star-pagination\">*575</span> attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case \"outside the `heartland' to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.\" <i>Rita,</i> 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2465. On the other hand, while the Guidelines are no longer binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge's view that the Guidelines range \"fails properly to reflect § 3553(a) considerations\" even in a mine-run case. <i>Ibid.</i> Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. in <i>Gall v. United States</i><i>,</i> O.T.2007, No. 06-7949, pp. 38-39.</p>\n<p>The crack cocaine Guidelines, however, present no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter because those Guidelines do not exemplify the Commission's exercise of its characteristic institutional role. In formulating Guidelines ranges for crack cocaine offenses, as we earlier noted, the Commission looked to the mandatory minimum sentences set in the 1986 Act, and did not take account of \"empirical data and national experience.\" See <i>Pruitt,</i> 502 F.3d, at 1171 (McConnell, J., concurring). Indeed, the Commission itself has reported that the crack/powder disparity produces disproportionately harsh sanctions, <i>i.e.,</i> sentences for crack cocaine offenses \"greater than necessary\" in light of the purposes of sentencing set forth in § 3553(a). See <i>supra,</i> at 568. Given all this, it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \"greater than necessary\" to achieve § 3553(a)'s purposes, even in a mine-run case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Taking account of the foregoing discussion in appraising the District Court's disposition in this case, we conclude that the 180-month sentence imposed on Kimbrough should survive appellate inspection. The District Court began by properly calculating and considering the advisory Guidelines range. It then addressed the relevant § 3553(a) factors. First, the court considered \"the nature and circumstances\" of the crime, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1), which was an unremarkable drug-trafficking offense. App. 72-73 (\"[T]his defendant and another defendant were caught sitting in a car with some crack cocaine and powder by two police officers  that's the sum and substance of it  [and they also had] a firearm.\"). Second, the court considered Kimbrough's \"history and characteristics.\" § 3553(a)(1). The court noted that Kimbrough had no prior felony convictions, that he had served in combat during Operation Desert Storm and received an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps, and that he had a steady history of employment.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the court alluded to the Sentencing Commission's reports criticizing the 100  to  1 ratio, cf. § 3553(a)(5) (Supp. V), noting that the Commission \"recognizes that crack cocaine has not caused the damage that the Justice Department alleges it has.\" App. 72. Comparing the Guidelines range to the range that would have applied if Kimbrough had possessed an equal amount of powder, the court suggested that the 100  to  1 ratio itself created an unwarranted disparity within the meaning of § 3553(a). Finally, the court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own. Rather, it appropriately framed its final determination in line with § 3553(a)'s overarching instruction to \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in § 3553(a)(2). See <i>supra,</i> at 570. Concluding that \"the crack cocaine guidelines [drove] the offense level to a point higher than is necessary to do justice in this case,\" App. 72, the District Court thus rested its sentence on the appropriate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*576</span> considerations and \"committed no procedural error,\" <i>Gall v. United States, ante,</i> ___ U.S., at ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, at 600, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4292116</span></span>.</p>\n<p>The ultimate question in Kimbrough's case is \"whether the sentence was reasonable  <i>i.e.,</i> whether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the § 3553(a) factors supported a sentence of [15 years] and justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The sentence the District Court imposed on Kimbrough was 4.5 years below the bottom of the Guidelines range. But in determining that 15 years was the appropriate prison term, the District Court properly homed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbrough's case and accorded weight to the Sentencing Commission's consistent and emphatic position that the crack/powder disparity is at odds with § 3553(a). See Part II-B, <i>supra.</i> Indeed, aside from its claim that the 100  to  1 ratio is mandatory, the Government did not attack the District Court's downward variance as unsupported by § 3553(a). Giving due respect to the District Court's reasoned appraisal, a reviewing court could not rationally conclude that the 4.5-year sentence reduction Kimbrough received qualified as an abuse of discretion. See <i>Gall, ante,</i> at ___ - ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, at 601-602; <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469-2470, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, concurring.</p>\n<p>The Court says that \"closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge's view that the Guidelines range 'fails properly to reflect § 3553(a) considerations' even in a mine-run case,\" but that this case \"present[s] no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter.\" <i>Ante,</i> at ___ (quoting <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). I join the opinion only because I do not take this to be an unannounced abandonment of the following clear statements in our recent opinions:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Our remedial opinion] requires a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges, ... but it permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well, see § 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[W]ithout this provision  namely the provision that makes `the relevant sentencing rules ... mandatory and impose[s] binding requirements on all sentencing judges'  the statute falls outside the scope of requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\" <i>United States v.

If there is any thumb on the scales; if the Guidelines <i>must</i> be followed even where the district court's application of the § 3553(a) factors is entirely reasonable; then the \"advisory\" Guidelines would, over a large expanse of their application, <i>entitle</i> the defendant to a lesser sentence <i>but for</i> the presence of certain additional facts found by judge rather than jury. This, as we said in <i>Booker,</i> would violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I continue to disagree with the remedy fashioned in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"143790\"><a href=\"/opinion/143790/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 258-265, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Court's post-<i>Booker</i> sentencing cases illustrate why the remedial majority in <i>Booker</i> was mistaken to craft a remedy far broader than necessary to correct constitutional error. The Court is now confronted with a host of questions about how to administer a sentencing scheme that has no basis in the statute. Because the Court's decisions in this area are necessarily grounded in policy considerations rather than law, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>In <i>Booker,</i> the Court held that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines violate the Sixth Amendment insofar as they permit a judge to make findings that raise a sentence beyond the level justified by the \"`facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 232, 125 S.Ct. 738 (quoting <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (emphasis deleted)). In my view, this violation was more suitably remedied by requiring any such facts to be submitted to the jury. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 323-325, 125 S.Ct. 738 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in part). That approach would have been consistent with our longstanding presumption of the severability of unconstitutional applications of statutory provisions. <i>Id.,</i> at 322-323, 125 S.Ct. 738 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in part). And it would have achieved compliance with the Sixth Amendment while doing the least amount of violence to the mandatory sentencing regime that Congress enacted. <i>Id.,</i> at 324-326, 125 S.Ct. 738 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in part). The Court, however, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*578</span> chose a more sweeping remedy. Despite acknowledging that under the mandatory Guidelines not \"every sentence gives rise to a Sixth Amendment violation,\" the Court rendered the Guidelines advisory in their entirety and mandated appellate review of all sentences for \"reasonableness.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 268, 125 S.Ct. 738. Because the Court's \"solution fail[ed] to tailor the remedy to the wrong,\" I dissented from the remedial opinion. <i>Id.,</i> at 313, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>As a result of the Court's remedial approach, we are now called upon to decide a multiplicity of questions that have no discernibly legal answers. Last Term, in <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), the Court held that a Court of Appeals may treat sentences within the properly calculated Guidelines range as presumptively reasonable. Today, in <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4292116</span></span>, the Court holds that a Court of Appeals may not require sentences that deviate substantially from the Guidelines range to be justified by extraordinary circumstances. And here the Court holds that sentencing courts are free to reject the Sentencing Guidelines' 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio.</p>\n<p>These outcomes may be perfectly reasonable as a matter of policy, but they have no basis in law. Congress did not mandate a reasonableness standard of appellate review  that was a standard the remedial majority in <i>Booker</i> fashioned out of whole cloth. See 543 U.S., at 307-312, 125 S.Ct. 738 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part). The Court must now give content to that standard, but in so doing it does not and cannot rely on any statutory language or congressional intent. We are asked here to determine whether, under the new advisory Guidelines regime, district courts may impose sentences based in part on their disagreement with a categorical policy judgment reflected in the Guidelines. But the Court's answer to that question necessarily derives from something other than the statutory language or congressional intent because Congress, by making the Guidelines mandatory, quite clearly intended to bind district courts to the Sentencing Commission's categorical policy judgments. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (excised by <i>Booker).</i> By rejecting this statutory approach, the <i>Booker</i> remedial majority has left the Court with no law to apply and forced it to assume the legislative role of devising a new sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p>Although I joined Justice SCALIA's dissent in <i>Rita</i> accepting the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion as a matter of \"statutory <i>stare decisis,\"</i> 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2475, I am now convinced that there is no principled way to apply the <i>Booker</i> remedy  certainly not one based on the statute. Accordingly, I think it best to apply the statute as written, including 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b), which makes the Guidelines mandatory. Cf. <i>Dickerson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118380\"><a href=\"/opinion/118380/dickerson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span>, 465, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Applying the statute as written, it is clear that the District Court erred by departing below the mandatory Guidelines range. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals vacating petitioner's sentence and remanding for resentencing.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, dissenting.</p>\n<p>For the reasons explained in my dissent in <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4292116</span></span>, I would hold that, under the remedial decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"143790\"><a href=\"/opinion/143790/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 258-265, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district judge is still <span class=\"star-pagination\">*579</span> required to give significant weight to the policy decisions embodied in the Guidelines. The <i>Booker</i> remedial decision, however, does not permit a court of appeals to treat the Guidelines' policy decisions as binding. I would not draw a distinction between the Guideline at issue here and other Guidelines. Accordingly, I would vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The statutory range for possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack is ten years to life. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The same range applies to the conspiracy offense. See § 846 (2000 ed.).

See 1995 Report 18.</p>\n<p>[6]  As explained in Part II-C, <i>infra,</i> the Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines and reduced sentences for crack offenses effective November 1, 2007. Except as noted, this opinion refers to the 2004 Guidelines in effect at the time of Kimbrough's sentencing.</p>\n<p>[7]  Congress created the Sentencing Commission and charged it with promulgating the Guidelines in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987, 18 U.S.C. § 3551 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. V), but the first version of the Guidelines did not become operative until November 1987, see 1995 Report ii-iv.</p>\n<p>[8]  An offense level of 12 results in a Guidelines range of 10 to 16 months for a first-time offender; an offense level of 38 results in a range of 235 to 293 months for the same offender. See USSG ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table.</p>\n<p>[9]  Subsection 994(p) requires the Commission to submit Guidelines amendments to Congress and provides that such amendments become effective unless \"modified or disapproved by Act of Congress.\"</p>\n<p>[10]  The amended Guidelines still produce sentencing ranges keyed to the mandatory minimums in the 1986 Act. Under the pre-2007 Guidelines, the 5- and 50-gram quantities that trigger the statutory minimums produced sentencing ranges that slightly <i>exceeded</i> those statutory minimums. Under the amended Guidelines, in contrast, the 5- and 50-gram quantities produce \"base offense levels corresponding to guideline ranges that <i>include</i> the statutory mandatory minimum penalties.\" 2007 Report 9.</p>\n<p>[11]  The Commission has not yet determined whether the amendment will be retroactive to cover defendants like Kimbrough. Even under the amendment, however, Kimbrough's Guidelines range would be 195 to 218 months  well above the 180-month sentence imposed by the District Court. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed.Reg. 28571-28572 (2007); USSG ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table.</p>\n<p>[12]  The remedial opinion also severed and excised the provision of the statute requiring <i>de novo</i> review of departures from the Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e), because that provision depended on the Guidelines' mandatory status. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>[13]  The Government concedes that a district court may vary from the 100  to  1 ratio if it does so \"based on the individualized circumstance[s]\" of a particular case. Brief for United States 45. But the Government maintains that the 100  to  1 ratio is binding in the sense that a court may not give any weight to its own view that the ratio itself is inconsistent with the § 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p>[14]  At oral argument, the Government sought to distinguish <i>Neal v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117994\"><a href=\"/opinion/117994/neal-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 116 S.Ct. 763, 133 L.Ed.2d 709 (1996), on the ground that the validity of the amended Guidelines was not before us in that case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 25. That is true, but only because the Government did not challenge the amendment. In fact, the Government's brief appeared to acknowledge that the Commission may legitimately deviate from the policies and methods embodied in the 1986 Act, even if the deviation produces some inconsistency. See Brief for United States in <i>Neal v. United States</i><i>,</i> O.T.1995, No. 94-9088, p. 26 (\"When the Commission's views about sentencing policy depart from those of Congress, it may become difficult to achieve entirely consistent sentencing, but that is a matter for Congress, not the courts, to address.\"). Moreover, our opinion in <i>Neal</i> assumed that the amendment was a legitimate exercise of the Commission's authority. See 516 U.S., at 294, 116 S.Ct. 763 (noting with apparent approval the Commission's position that \"the Guidelines calculation is independent of the statutory calculation\").</p>\n<p>[15]  The Sentencing Commission reports that roughly 70% of crack offenders are responsible for drug quantities that yield base offense levels at or only two levels above those that correspond to the statutory minimums.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 06–6330. Argued October 2, 2007—Decided December 10, 2007\nUnder the statute criminalizing the manufacture and distribution of\n cocaine, 21 U. S. C. §841, and the relevant Federal Sentencing Guide\n lines, a drug trafficker dealing in crack cocaine is subject to the same\n sentence as one dealing in 100 times more powder cocaine. Petitioner\n Kimbrough pleaded guilty to four offenses: conspiracy to distribute\n crack and powder; possession with intent to distribute more than 50\n grams of crack; possession with intent to distribute powder; and pos\n session of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense. Un\n der the relevant statutes, Kimbrough’s plea subjected him to a mini\n mum prison term of 15 years and a maximum of life. The applicable\n advisory Guidelines range was 228 to 270 months, or 19 to 22.5\n years. The District Court found, however, that a sentence in this\n range would have been greater than necessary to accomplish the\n purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U. S. C. §3553(a). In making\n that determination, the court relied in part on its view that\n Kimbrough’s case exemplified the “disproportionate and unjust effect\n that crack cocaine guidelines have in sentencing.” The court noted\n that if Kimbrough had possessed only powder cocaine, his Guidelines\n range would have been far lower: 97 to 106 months. Concluding that\n the statutory minimum sentence was long enough to accomplish\n §3553(a)’s objectives, the court sentenced Kimbrough to 15 years, or\n 180 months, in prison. The Fourth Circuit vacated the sentence,\n finding that a sentence outside the Guidelines range is per se unrea\n sonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing dis\n parity for crack and powder offenses.\nHeld:\n    1. Under United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, the cocaine Guide\n lines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only, and the Fourth Cir\n2                   KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cuit erred in holding the crack/powder disparity effectively manda\n    tory. A district judge must include the Guidelines range in the array\n    of factors warranting consideration, but the judge may determine\n    that, in the particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is “greater\n    than necessary” to serve the objectives of sentencing, §3553(a). In\n    making that determination, the judge may consider the disparity be\n    tween the Guidelines’ treatment of crack and powder offenses. Pp. 5–\n    21.\n         (a) Crack and powder cocaine have the same physiological and\n    psychotropic effects, but are handled very differently for sentencing\n    purposes. The relevant statutes and Guidelines employ a 100-to-1\n    ratio that yields sentences for crack offenses three to six times longer\n    than those for offenses involving equal amounts of powder. Thus, a\n    major supplier of powder may receive a shorter sentence than a low-\n    level dealer who buys powder and converts it to crack. Pp. 5–11.\n            (1) The crack/powder disparity originated in the Anti-Drug\n    Abuse Act of 1986 (1986 Act), which created a two-tiered scheme of\n    five- and ten-year mandatory minimum sentences for drug manufac\n    turing and distribution offenses. Congress apparently adopted the\n    100-to-1 ratio because it believed that crack, a relatively new drug in\n    1986, was significantly more dangerous than powder. Thus, the 1986\n    Act’s five-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant ac\n    countable for 5 grams of crack or 500 grams of powder, and its ten-\n    year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for\n    50 grams of crack or 5,000 grams of powder. In developing Guide\n    lines sentences for cocaine offenses, the Sentencing Commission em\n    ployed the statute’s weight-driven scheme, rather than its usual em\n    pirical approach based on past sentencing practices. The statute\n    itself specifies only two quantities of each drug, but the Guidelines\n    used the 100-to-1 ratio to set sentences for a full range of drug quan\n    tities. Pp. 6–8.\n            (2) Based on additional research and experience with the 100\n    to-1 ratio, the Commission later determined that the crack/powder\n    differential does not meet the objectives of the Sentencing Reform Act\n    and the 1986 Act. The Commission also found the disparity inconsis\n    tent with the 1986 Act’s goal of punishing major drug traffickers\n    more severely than low-level dealers, and furthermore observed that\n    the differential fosters a lack of confidence in the criminal justice sys\n    tem because of a perception that it promotes an unwarranted diver\n    gence based on race. Pp. 8–10.\n            (3) The Commission has several times sought to achieve a re\n    duction in the crack/powder ratio. Congress rejected a 1995 amend\n    ment to the Guidelines that would have replaced the 100-to-1 ratio\n    with a 1-to-1 ratio, but directed the Commission to propose revision\n                   Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                   3\n\n                             Syllabus\n\nof the ratio under the relevant statutes and Guidelines. Congress\ntook no action after the Commission’s 1997 and 2002 reports recom\nmended changing the ratio. The Commission’s 2007 report again\nurged Congress to amend the 1986 Act, but the Commission also\nadopted an ameliorating change in the Guidelines. The modest\namendment, which became effective on November 1, 2007, yields sen\ntences for crack offenses between two and five times longer than sen\ntences for equal amounts of powder. The Commission thus noted\nthat it is only a partial remedy to the problems generated by the\ncrack/powder disparity. Pp. 10–11.\n     (b) The federal sentencing statute, as modified by Booker, re\nquires a court to give respectful consideration to the Guidelines, but\n“permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other [§3553(a)]\nconcerns as well,” 543 U. S., at 245–246. The Government contends\nthat the Guidelines adopting the 100-to-1 ratio are an exception to\nthis general freedom and offers three arguments in support of its po\nsition, each of which this Court rejects. Pp. 11–21.\n       (1) The Government argues that the 1986 Act itself prohibits\nthe Commission and sentencing courts from disagreeing with the\n100-to-1 ratio. This position lacks grounding in the statute, which,\nby its terms, mandates only maximum and minimum sentences: A\nperson convicted of possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or\nmore of crack must be sentenced to a minimum of 5 years and a\nmaximum of 40. A person with 50 grams or more of crack must be\nsentenced to a minimum of 10 years and a maximum of life. The\nstatute says nothing about appropriate sentences within these brack\nets, and this Court declines to read any implicit directive into the\ncongressional silence. See Jama v. Immigration and Customs En\nforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 341. Drawing meaning from silence is par\nticularly inappropriate here, because Congress knows how to direct\nsentencing practices in express terms. See, e.g., 28 U. S. C. §994(h).\nThis cautious reading of the 1986 Act draws force from Neal v. United\nStates, 516 U. S. 284, which involved different methods of calculating\nlysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) weights: The method applicable in\ndetermining statutory minimum sentences combined the weight of\nthe pure drug and its carrier medium, while the one controlling the\ncalculation of Guidelines ranges presumed a lower weight for the car\nrier medium. This Court rejected the argument that the Guidelines\nand the statute should be interpreted consistently, with the Guide\nlines’ presumptive-weight method controlling the mandatory mini\nmum calculation. Were the Government’s current position correct,\nthe Guidelines involved in Neal would be in serious jeopardy. The\nsame reasons alleged to justify reading into the 1986 Act an implicit\ncommand to the Commission and sentencing courts to apply the 100\n4                   KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    to-1 ratio to all crack quantities could be urged in support of an ar\n    gument that the 1986 Act requires the Commission to include the full\n    weight of the carrier medium in calculating LSD weights. Yet Neal\n    never questioned the Guidelines’ validity, and in fact endorsed the\n    Commission’s freedom to adopt a new method. If the 1986 Act does\n    not require the Commission to adhere to the Act’s method for deter\n    mining LSD weights, it does not require the Commission—or, after\n    Booker, sentencing courts—to adhere to the 100-to-1 ratio for crack\n    quantities other than those triggering the statutory mandatory mini\n    mum sentences. Pp. 13–16.\n           (2) The Government also argues that Congress made clear, in\n    disapproving the Commission’s 1995 proposed Guidelines amend\n    ment, that the 1986 Act required the Commission and courts to re\n    spect the 100-to-1 ratio. But nothing in Congress’ 1995 action sug\n    gested that crack sentences must exceed powder sentences by a ratio\n    of 100 to 1. To the contrary, Congress required the Commission to\n    recommend a revision of the ratio. The Government argues that, by\n    calling for recommendations to change both the statute and the\n    Guidelines, Congress meant to bar any Guidelines alteration in ad\n    vance of congressional action. But the more likely reading is that\n    Congress sought proposals to amend both the statute and the Guide\n    lines because the Commission’s criticisms of the 100-to-1 ratio con\n    cerned the exorbitance of the crack/powder disparity in both contexts.\n    Moreover, as a result of the 2007 amendment, which Congress did\n    not disapprove or modify, the Guidelines now deviate from the stat\n    ute’s 100-to-1 ratio, advancing a ratio that varies (at different offense\n    levels) between 25 to 1 and 80 to 1. Pp. 16–18.\n           (3) Finally, the Government argues that if district courts are\n    free to deviate from the Guidelines based on disagreements with the\n    crack/powder ratio, “unwarranted sentence disparities,” 18 U. S. C.\n    §3553(a)(6), will ensue. The Government claims that, because sen\n    tencing courts remain bound by the 1986 Act’s mandatory minimum\n    sentences, deviations from the 100-to-1 ratio could result in sentenc\n    ing “cliffs” around quantities triggering the mandatory minimums.\n    For example, a district court could grant a sizable downward vari\n    ance to a defendant convicted of distributing 49 grams of crack, but\n    would be required by the statutory minimum to impose a much\n    higher sentence for only 1 additional gram. The LSD Guidelines ap\n    proved in Neal, however, create a similar risk of sentencing “cliffs.”\n    The Government also maintains that, if district courts are permitted\n    to vary from the Guidelines based on their disagreement with the\n    crack/powder disparity, defendants will receive markedly different\n    sentences depending on the particular judge drawn for sentencing.\n    While uniformity remains an important sentencing goal, Booker rec\n                   Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                     5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nognized that some departures from uniformity were a necessary cost\nof the remedy that decision adopted. And as to crack sentences in\nparticular, possible variations among district courts are constrained\nby the 1986 Act’s mandatory minimums. Moreover, to the extent\nthat the Government correctly identifies risks of “unwarranted sen\ntence disparities” within the meaning of §3353(a)(6), the proper solu\ntion is for district courts to take account of sentencing practices in\nother courts and the “cliffs” resulting from the statutory mandatory\nminimum sentences and weigh these disparities against the other\n§3553(a) factors and any unwarranted disparities created by the\ncrack/powder ratio itself. Pp. 18–20.\n      (c) Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, 543\nU. S., at 245, but preserved a key role for the Sentencing Commis\nsion. In the ordinary case, the Commission’s recommendation of a\nsentencing range will “reflect a rough approximation of sentences\nthat might achieve §3553(a)’s objectives.” Rita v. United States, 551\nU. S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 11). The sentencing judge, on the other\nhand, is “in a superior position to find facts and judge their import\nunder §3553(a) in each particular case.” Gall v. United States, ante,\nat 13 (internal quotation marks omitted). In light of these discrete\ninstitutional strengths, a district court’s decision to vary from the ad\nvisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing\njudge finds a particular case “outside the ‘heartland’ to which the\nCommission intends individual Guidelines to apply.” Rita, 551 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 12). On the other hand, while the Guidelines are\nno longer binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing\njudge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge’s view that\nthe Guidelines range “fails properly to reflect §3553(a) considera\ntions” even in a mine-run case. Ibid. The crack cocaine Guidelines,\nhowever, present no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter\nbecause those Guidelines do not exemplify the Commission’s exercise\nof its characteristic institutional role. Given the Commission’s depar\nture from its empirical approach in formulating the crack Guidelines\nand its subsequent criticism of the crack/powder disparity, it would\nnot be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when\nsentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity\nyields a sentence “greater than necessary” to achieve §3553(a)’s pur\nposes, even in a mine-run case. Pp. 20–21.\n   2. The 180-month sentence imposed on Kimbrough should survive\nappellate inspection. The District Court began by properly calculat\ning and considering the advisory Guidelines range. It then addressed\nthe relevant §3553(a) factors, including the Sentencing Commission’s\nreports criticizing the 100-to-1 ratio. Finally, the court did not pur\nport to establish a ratio of its own, but appropriately framed its final\n6                  KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    determination in line with §3553(a)’s overarching instruction to “im\n    pose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary” to accom\n    plish the sentencing goals advanced in §3553(a)(2). The court thus\n    rested its sentence on the appropriate considerations and “committed\n    no procedural error,” Gall, ante, at 17. Kimbrough’s sentence was 4.5\n    years below the bottom of the Guidelines range. But in determining\n    that 15 years was the appropriate prison term, the District Court\n    properly homed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbrough’s\n    case and accorded weight to the Sentencing Commission’s consistent\n    and emphatic position that the crack/powder disparity is at odds with\n    §3553(a). Giving due respect to the District Court’s reasoned ap\n    praisal, a reviewing court could not rationally conclude that the 4.5\n    year sentence reduction Kimbrough received qualified as an abuse of\n    discretion.

S. 220, 244 (2005), instructed district\ncourts to read the United States Sentencing Guidelines as\n“effectively advisory,” id., at 245. In accord with 18\nU. S. C. §3553(a), the Guidelines, formerly mandatory,\nnow serve as one factor among several courts must con­\nsider in determining an appropriate sentence. Booker\nfurther instructed that “reasonableness” is the standard\ncontrolling appellate review of the sentences district\ncourts impose.\n   Under the statute criminalizing the manufacture and\ndistribution of crack cocaine, 21 U. S. C. §841, and the\nrelevant Guidelines prescription, §2D1.1, a drug trafficker\ndealing in crack cocaine is subject to the same sentence as\none dealing in 100 times more powder cocaine. The ques­\ntion here presented is whether, as the Court of Appeals\nheld in this case, “a sentence . . . outside the guidelines\nrange is per se unreasonable when it is based on a dis­\nagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and\npowder cocaine offenses.” 174 Fed. Appx. 798, 799 (CA4\n2                 KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n2006) (per curiam). We hold that, under Booker, the co­\ncaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory\nonly, and that the Court of Appeals erred in holding the\ncrack/powder disparity effectively mandatory. A district\njudge must include the Guidelines range in the array of\nfactors warranting consideration. The judge may deter­\nmine, however, that, in the particular case, a within-\nGuidelines sentence is “greater than necessary” to serve\nthe objectives of sentencing. 18 U. S. C. §3553(a) (2000 ed.\nand Supp. V). In making that determination, the judge\nmay consider the disparity between the Guidelines’ treat­\nment of crack and powder cocaine offenses.\n                               I\n   In September 2004, petitioner Derrick Kimbrough was\nindicted in the United States District Court for the East­\nern District of Virginia and charged with four offenses:\nconspiracy to distribute crack and powder cocaine; posses­\nsion with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack\ncocaine; possession with intent to distribute powder co­\ncaine; and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-\ntrafficking offense. Kimbrough pleaded guilty to all four\ncharges.\n   Under the relevant statutes, Kimbrough’s plea subjected\nhim to an aggregate sentence of 15 years to life in prison:\n10 years to life for the three drug offenses, plus a consecu­\ntive term of 5 years to life for the firearm offense.1 In\n——————\n   1 The statutory range for possession with intent to distribute more\n\nthan 50 grams of crack is ten years to life.            See 21 U. S. C.\n§841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The same range applies to the\nconspiracy offense. See §846 (2000 ed.). The statutory range for\npossession with intent to distribute powder cocaine is 0 to 20 years.\nSee §841(b)(1)(C) (Supp. V). Finally, the statutory range for possession\nof a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense is five years to\nlife. See 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(i). The sentences for the three drug\ncrimes may run concurrently, see §3584(a), but the sentence for the\nfirearm offense must be consecutive, see §924(c)(1)(A).\n                    Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\norder to determine the appropriate sentence within this\nstatutory range, the District Court first calculated\nKimbrough’s sentence under the advisory Sentencing\nGuidelines.2 Kimbrough’s guilty plea acknowledged that\nhe was accountable for 56 grams of crack cocaine and 92.1\ngrams of powder cocaine. This quantity of drugs yielded a\nbase offense level of 32 for the three drug charges. See\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual\n§2D1.1(c) (Nov. 2004) (USSG). Finding that Kimbrough,\nby asserting sole culpability for the crime, had testified\nfalsely at his codefendant’s trial, the District Court in­\ncreased his offense level to 34. See §3C1.1. In accord with\nthe presentence report, the court determined that\nKimbrough’s criminal history category was II. An offense\nlevel of 34 and a criminal history category of II yielded a\nGuidelines range of 168 to 210 months for the three drug\ncharges. See id., ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. The\nGuidelines sentence for the firearm offense was the statu­\ntory minimum, 60 months.             See USSG §2K2.4(b).\nKimbrough’s final advisory Guidelines range was thus 228\nto 270 months, or 19 to 22.5 years.\n  A sentence in this range, in the District Court’s judg­\nment, would have been “greater than necessary” to accom­\nplish the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U. S. C.\n§3553(a). App. 72. As required by §3553(a), the court took\ninto account the “nature and circumstances” of the offense\nand Kimbrough’s “history and characteristics.” Id., at 72–\n73. The court also commented that the case exemplified\nthe “disproportionate and unjust effect that crack cocaine\nguidelines have in sentencing.” Id., at 72. In this regard,\nthe court contrasted Kimbrough’s Guidelines range of 228\n\n——————\n  2 Kimbrough   was sentenced in April 2005, three months after our\ndecision in Booker v. United States, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), rendered the\nGuidelines advisory. The District Court employed the version of the\nGuidelines effective November 1, 2004.\n4                KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nto 270 months with the range that would have applied had\nhe been accountable for an equivalent amount of powder\ncocaine: 97 to 106 months, inclusive of the 5-year manda­\ntory minimum for the firearm charge, see USSG §2D1.1(c);\nid., ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. Concluding that the\nstatutory minimum sentence was “clearly long enough” to\naccomplish the objectives listed in §3553(a), the court\nsentenced Kimbrough to 15 years, or 180 months, in\nprison plus 5 years of supervised release. App. 74–75.3\n   In an unpublished per curiam opinion, the Fourth Cir­\ncuit vacated the sentence. Under Circuit precedent, the\nCourt of Appeals observed, a sentence “outside the guide­\nlines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a\ndisagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and\npowder cocaine offenses.” 174 Fed. Appx., at 799 (citing\nUnited States v. Eura, 440 F. 3d 625, 633–634 (CA4 2006)).\n   We granted certiorari, 551 U. S. ___ (2007), to determine\nwhether the crack/powder disparity adopted in the United\nStates Sentencing Guidelines has been rendered “advi­\nsory” by our decision in Booker.4\n\n——————\n   3 The prison sentence consisted of 120 months on each of the three\n\ndrug counts, to be served concurrently, plus 60 months on the firearm\ncount, to be served consecutively.\n   4 This question has divided the Courts of Appeals.

Crack and powder cocaine are two forms of\nthe same drug. Powder cocaine, or cocaine hydrochloride,\nis generally inhaled through the nose; it may also be\nmixed with water and injected. See United States Sen­\ntencing Commission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine\nand Federal Sentencing Policy 5, 12 (Feb. 1995), available\nat http://www.ussc.gov/crack/exec.htm (hereinafter 1995\nReport). (All Internet materials as visited Dec. 7, 2007,\nand included in Clerk of Court’s case file.) Crack cocaine,\na type of cocaine base, is formed by dissolving powder\ncocaine and baking soda in boiling water. Id., at 14. The\nresulting solid is divided into single-dose “rocks” that\nusers smoke. Ibid. The active ingredient in powder and\ncrack cocaine is the same. Id., at 9. The two forms of the\ndrug also have the same physiological and psychotropic\neffects, but smoking crack cocaine allows the body to\nabsorb the drug much faster than inhaling powder co­\ncaine, and thus produces a shorter, more intense high.\nId., at 15–19.5\n  Although chemically similar, crack and powder cocaine\nare handled very differently for sentencing purposes.\nThe 100-to-1 ratio yields sentences for crack offenses\nthree to six times longer than those for powder offenses\ninvolving equal amounts of drugs. See United States\nSentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine\nand Federal Sentencing Policy iv (May 2002),\navailable    at    http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/02crack/\n2002crackrpt.pdf (hereinafter 2002 Report).6 This dispar­\n——————\n  5 Injectingpowder cocaine produces effects similar to smoking crack\ncocaine, but very few powder users inject the drug. See 1995 Report 18.\n  6 As explained in Part II–C, infra, the Sentencing Commission\n\namended the Guidelines and reduced sentences for crack offenses\n6                KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nity means that a major supplier of powder cocaine may\nreceive a shorter sentence than a low-level dealer who\nbuys powder from the supplier but then converts it to\ncrack. See 1995 Report 193–194.\n                               A\n  The crack/powder disparity originated in the Anti-Drug\nAbuse Act of 1986 (1986 Act), 100 Stat. 3207. The 1986\nAct created a two-tiered scheme of five- and ten-year\nmandatory minimum sentences for drug manufacturing\nand distribution offenses. Congress sought “to link the\nten-year mandatory minimum trafficking prison term to\nmajor drug dealers and to link the five-year minimum\nterm to serious traffickers.” 1995 Report 119. The 1986\nAct uses the weight of the drugs involved in the offense as\nthe sole proxy to identify “major” and “serious” dealers.\nFor example, any defendant responsible for 100 grams of\nheroin is subject to the five-year mandatory minimum, see\n21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(B)(i) (2000 ed. and Supp V), and any\ndefendant responsible for 1,000 grams of heroin is subject\nto the ten-year mandatory minimum, see §841(b)(1)(A)(i).\n  Crack cocaine was a relatively new drug when the 1986\nAct was signed into law, but it was already a matter of\ngreat public concern: “Drug abuse in general, and crack\ncocaine in particular, had become in public opinion and in\nmembers’ minds a problem of overwhelming dimensions.”\n1995 Report 121. Congress apparently believed that crack\nwas significantly more dangerous than powder cocaine in\nthat: (1) crack was highly addictive; (2) crack users and\ndealers were more likely to be violent than users and\ndealers of other drugs; (3) crack was more harmful to\nusers than powder, particularly for children who had been\nexposed by their mothers’ drug use during pregnancy; (4)\n\n—————— \n\neffective November 1, 2007. Except as noted, this opinion refers to the\n\n2004 Guidelines in effect at the time of Kimbrough’s sentencing. \n\n                      Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncrack use was especially prevalent among teenagers; and\n(5) crack’s potency and low cost were making it increas­\ningly popular. See 2002 Report 90.\n   Based on these assumptions, the 1986 Act adopted a\n“100-to-1 ratio” that treated every gram of crack cocaine as\nthe equivalent of 100 grams of powder cocaine. The Act’s\nfive-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant\naccountable for 5 grams of crack or 500 grams of powder,\n21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(B)(ii), (iii); its ten-year mandatory\nminimum applies to any defendant accountable for 50\ngrams of crack or 5,000 grams of powder, §841(b)(1)(A)(ii),\n(iii).\n   While Congress was considering adoption of the 1986\nAct, the Sentencing Commission was engaged in formulat­\ning the Sentencing Guidelines.7 In the main, the Commis­\nsion developed Guidelines sentences using an empirical\napproach based on data about past sentencing practices,\nincluding 10,000 presentence investigation reports. See\nUSSG §1A.1, intro. comment., pt. A, ¶3. The Commission\n“modif[ied] and adjust[ed] past practice in the interests of\ngreater rationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with\ncongressional instructions, and the like.” Rita v. United\nStates, 551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 10).\n   The Commission did not use this empirical approach in\ndeveloping the Guidelines sentences for drug-trafficking\noffenses. Instead, it employed the 1986 Act’s weight-\ndriven scheme. The Guidelines use a drug quantity table\nbased on drug type and weight to set base offense levels\nfor drug trafficking offenses. See USSG §2D1.1(c). In\nsetting offense levels for crack and powder cocaine, the\nCommission, in line with the 1986 Act, adopted the\n——————\n  7 Congress created the Sentencing Commission and charged it with\n\npromulgating the Guidelines in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98\nStat. 1987, 18 U. S. C. §3551 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. V), but the first\nversion of the Guidelines did not become operative until November\n1987, see 1995 Report ii–iv.\n8                 KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n100-to-1 ratio. The statute itself specifies only two quanti­\nties of each drug, but the Guidelines “go further and set\nsentences for the full range of possible drug quantities\nusing the same 100-to-1 quantity ratio.” 1995 Report 1.\nThe Guidelines’ drug quantity table sets base offense\nlevels ranging from 12, for offenses involving less than 250\nmilligrams of crack (or 25 grams of powder), to 38, for\noffenses involving more than 1.5 kilograms of crack (or\n150 kilograms of powder). USSG §2D1.1(c).8\n                              B\n   Although the Commission immediately used the\n100-to-1 ratio to define base offense levels for all crack and\npowder offenses, it later determined that the crack/powder\nsentencing disparity is generally unwarranted. Based on\nadditional research and experience with the 100-to-1 ratio,\nthe Commission concluded that the disparity “fails to meet\nthe sentencing objectives set forth by Congress in both the\nSentencing Reform Act and the 1986 Act.” 2002 Re­\nport 91. In a series of reports, the Commission identified\nthree problems with the crack/powder disparity.\n   First, the Commission reported, the 100-to-1 ratio rested\non assumptions about “the relative harmfulness of the two\ndrugs and the relative prevalence of certain harmful con­\nduct associated with their use and distribution that more\nrecent research and data no longer support.” Ibid.; see\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Report to Con­\ngress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 8 (May\n2007),      available   at    http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/\ncocaine2007.pdf (hereinafter 2007 Report) (ratio Congress\nembedded in the statute far “overstate[s]” both “the rela­\ntive harmfulness” of crack cocaine, and the “seriousness of\n——————\n    8 An\n       offense level of 12 results in a Guidelines range of 10 to 16\nmonths for a first-time offender; an offense level of 38 results in a range\nof 235 to 293 months for the same offender. See USSG ch. 5, pt. A,\nSentencing Table.\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmost crack cocaine offenses”). For example, the Commis­\nsion found that crack is associated with “significantly less\ntrafficking-related violence . . . than previously assumed.”\n2002 Report 100. It also observed that “the negative\neffects of prenatal crack cocaine exposure are identical to\nthe negative effects of prenatal powder cocaine exposure.”\nId., at 94. The Commission furthermore noted that “the\nepidemic of crack cocaine use by youth never materialized\nto the extent feared.” Id., at 96.\n   Second,    the    Commission       concluded   that   the\ncrack/powder disparity is inconsistent with the 1986 Act’s\ngoal of punishing major drug traffickers more severely\nthan low-level dealers. Drug importers and major traf­\nfickers generally deal in powder cocaine, which is then\nconverted into crack by street-level sellers. See 1995\nReport 66–67. But the 100-to-1 ratio can lead to the\n“anomalous” result that “retail crack dealers get longer\nsentences than the wholesale drug distributors who supply\nthem the powder cocaine from which their crack is pro­\nduced.” Id., at 174.\n   Finally, the Commission stated that the crack/powder\nsentencing differential “fosters disrespect for and lack of\nconfidence in the criminal justice system” because of a\n“widely-held perception” that it “promotes unwarranted\ndisparity based on race.” 2002 Report 103. Approximately\n85 percent of defendants convicted of crack offenses in\nfederal court are black; thus the severe sentences required\nby the 100-to-1 ratio are imposed “primarily upon black\noffenders.” Ibid.\n   Despite these observations, the Commission’s most\nrecent reports do not urge identical treatment of crack and\npowder cocaine. In the Commission’s view, “some differ­\nential in the quantity-based penalties” for the two drugs is\nwarranted, id., at 102, because crack is more addictive\nthan powder, crack offenses are more likely to involve\nweapons or bodily injury, and crack distribution is associ­\n10              KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nated with higher levels of crime, see id., at 93–94, 101–\n102. But the 100-to-1 crack/powder ratio, the Commission\nconcluded, significantly overstates the differences between\nthe two forms of the drug. Accordingly, the Commission\nrecommended that the ratio be “substantially” reduced.\nId., at viii.\n                              C\n  The Commission has several times sought to achieve a\nreduction in the crack/powder ratio. In 1995, it proposed\namendments to the Guidelines that would have replaced\nthe 100-to-1 ratio with a 1-to-1 ratio. Complementing that\nchange, the Commission would have installed special\nenhancements for trafficking offenses involving weapons\nor bodily injury. See Amendments to the Sentencing\nGuidelines for United States Courts, 60 Fed. Reg. 25075–\n25077 (1995). Congress, acting pursuant to 28 U. S. C.\n§994(p),9 rejected the amendments. See Pub. L. 104–38,\n§1, 109 Stat. 334. Simultaneously, however, Congress\ndirected the Commission to “propose revision of the drug\nquantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine under the\nrelevant statutes and guidelines.” §2(a)(2), id., at 335.\n  In response to this directive, the Commission issued\nreports in 1997 and 2002 recommending that Congress\nchange the 100-to-1 ratio prescribed in the 1986 Act. The\n1997 Report proposed a 5-to-1 ratio. See United States\nSentencing Commission, Special Report to Congress:\nCocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 2 (Apr. 1997),\nhttp://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/newcrack.pdf. The 2002\nReport recommended lowering the ratio “at least” to 20 to\n1. 2002 Report viii. Neither proposal prompted congres­\nsional action.\n  The Commission’s most recent report, issued in 2007,\n——————\n   9 Subsection 994(p) requires the Commission to submit Guidelines\n\namendments to Congress and provides that such amendments become\neffective unless “modified or disapproved by Act of Congress.”\n                    Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                 11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nagain urged Congress to amend the 1986 Act to reduce the\n100-to-1 ratio. This time, however, the Commission did\nnot simply await congressional action. Instead, the Com­\nmission adopted an ameliorating change in the Guidelines.\nSee 2007 Report 9. The alteration, which became effective\non November 1, 2007, reduces the base offense level asso­\nciated with each quantity of crack by two levels. See\nAmendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United\nStates Courts, 72 Fed. Reg. 28571–28572 (2007).10 This\nmodest amendment yields sentences for crack offenses\nbetween two and five times longer than sentences for\nequal amounts of powder. See ibid.11 Describing the\namendment as “only . . . a partial remedy” for the prob­\nlems generated by the crack/powder disparity, the Com­\nmission noted that “[a]ny comprehensive solution requires\nappropriate legislative action by Congress.” 2007 Re­\nport 10.\n                              III\n  With this history of the crack/powder sentencing ratio in\nmind, we next consider the status of the Guidelines tied to\nthe ratio after our decision in United States v. Booker, 543\nU. S. 220 (2005). In Booker, the Court held that the man­\n——————\n   10 The amended Guidelines still produce sentencing ranges keyed to\n\nthe mandatory minimums in the 1986 Act. Under the pre-2007 Guide­\nlines, the 5- and 50-gram quantities that trigger the statutory mini­\nmums produced sentencing ranges that slightly exceeded those statu­\ntory minimums. Under the amended Guidelines, in contrast, the 5- and\n50-gram quantities produce “base offense levels corresponding to\nguideline ranges that include the statutory mandatory minimum\npenalties.” 2007 Report 9.\n   11 The Commission has not yet determined whether the amendment\n\nwill be retroactive to cover defendants like Kimbrough. Even under the\namendment, however, Kimbrough’s Guidelines range would be 195 to\n218 months—well above the 180-month sentence imposed by the\nDistrict Court. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for\nUnited States Courts, 72 Fed. Reg. 28571–28572 (2007); USSG ch. 5,\npt. A, Sentencing Table.\n12               KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndatory Sentencing Guidelines system violated the Sixth\nAmendment. See id., at 226–227. The Booker remedial\nopinion determined that the appropriate cure was to sever\nand excise the provision of the statute that rendered the\nGuidelines mandatory, 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV).12 This modification of the federal sentencing\nstatute, we explained, “makes the Guidelines effectively\nadvisory.” 543 U. S., at 245.\n  The statute, as modified by Booker, contains an over-\narching provision instructing district courts to “impose a\nsentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary” to\naccomplish the goals of sentencing, including “to reflect\nthe seriousness of the offense,” “to promote respect for the\nlaw,” “to provide just punishment for the offense,” “to\nafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,” and “to\nprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant.”\n18 U. S. C. §3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The statute\nfurther provides that, in determining the appropriate\nsentence, the court should consider a number of factors,\nincluding “the nature and circumstances of the offense,”\n“the history and characteristics of the defendant,” “the\nsentencing range established” by the Guidelines, “any\npertinent policy statement” issued by the Sentencing\nCommission pursuant to its statutory authority, and “the\nneed to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among\ndefendants with similar records who have been found\nguilty of similar conduct.” Ibid. In sum, while the statute\nstill requires a court to give respectful consideration to the\nGuidelines, see Gall v. United States, ante, at 7, 11, Booker\n“permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other\nstatutory concerns as well,” 543 U. S., at 245–246.\n\n——————\n  12 The remedial opinion also severed and excised the provision of the\nstatute requiring de novo review of departures from the Guidelines, 18\nU. S. C. §3742(e), because that provision depended on the Guidelines’\nmandatory status. Booker, 543 U. S., at 245.\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

Rita v. United States, 551\nU. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 12) (a district court may\nconsider arguments that “the Guidelines sentence itself\nfails properly to reflect §3553(a) considerations”). But the\nGovernment contends that the Guidelines adopting the\n100-to-1 ratio are an exception to the “general freedom\nthat sentencing courts have to apply the [§3553(a)] fac­\ntors.” Brief for United States 16. That is so, according to\nthe Government, because the ratio is a “specific policy\ndeterminatio[n] that Congress has directed sentencing\ncourts to observe.” Id., at 25. The Government offers\nthree arguments in support of this position. We consider\neach in turn.\n                              A\n  As its first and most heavily pressed argument, the\nGovernment urges that the 1986 Act itself prohibits the\nSentencing Commission and sentencing courts from dis­\nagreeing with the 100-to-1 ratio.13 The Government ac­\nknowledges that the “Congress did not expressly direct the\nSentencing Commission to incorporate the 100:1 ratio in\nthe Guidelines.” Brief for United States 33 (brackets and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, it as­\nserts that the Act “[i]mplicit[ly]” requires the Commission\nand sentencing courts to apply the 100-to-1 ratio. Id., at\n32. Any deviation, the Government urges, would be “logi­\n——————\n  13 The Government concedes that a district court may vary from the\n\n100-to-1 ratio if it does so “based on the individualized circumstance[s]”\nof a particular case. Brief for United States 45. But the Government\nmaintains that the 100-to-1 ratio is binding in the sense that a court\nmay not give any weight to its own view that the ratio itself is inconsis­\ntent with the §3553(a) factors.\n14            KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncally incoherent” when combined with mandatory mini­\nmum sentences based on the 100-to-1 ratio. Id., at 33.\n   This argument encounters a formidable obstacle: It\nlacks grounding in the text of the 1986 Act. The statute,\nby its terms, mandates only maximum and minimum\nsentences: A person convicted of possession with intent to\ndistribute 5 grams or more of crack cocaine must be sen­\ntenced to a minimum of 5 years and the maximum term is\n40 years. A person with 50 grams or more of crack cocaine\nmust be sentenced to a minimum of 10 years and the\nmaximum term is life. The statute says nothing about the\nappropriate sentences within these brackets, and we\ndecline to read any implicit directive into that congres­\nsional silence. See Jama v. Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 341 (2005) (“We do not lightly\nassume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text\nrequirements that it nonetheless intends to apply . . . .”).\nDrawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropri­\nate here, for Congress has shown that it knows how to\ndirect sentencing practices in express terms. For example,\nCongress has specifically required the Sentencing Com­\nmission to set Guidelines sentences for serious recidivist\noffenders “at or near” the statutory maximum. 28 U. S. C.\n§994(h). See also §994(i) (“The Commission shall assure\nthat the guidelines specify a sentence to a substantial term\nof imprisonment” for specified categories of offenders.).\n   Our cautious reading of the 1986 Act draws force from\nNeal v. United States, 516 U. S. 284 (1996). That case\ninvolved different methods of calculating lysergic acid\ndiethylamide (LSD) weights, one applicable in determin­\ning statutory minimum sentences, the other controlling\nthe calculation of Guidelines ranges. The 1986 Act sets\nmandatory minimum sentences based on the weight of “a\nmixture or substance containing a detectable amount” of\nLSD. 21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(A)(v), (B)(v). Prior to Neal, we\nhad interpreted that language to include the weight of the\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)         15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncarrier medium (usually blotter paper) on which LSD is\nabsorbed even though the carrier is usually far heavier\nthan the LSD itself. See Chapman v. United States, 500\nU. S. 453, 468 (1991). Until 1993, the Sentencing Com­\nmission had interpreted the relevant Guidelines in the\nsame way. That year, however, the Commission changed\nits approach and “instructed courts to give each dose of\nLSD on a carrier medium a constructive or presumed\nweight of 0.4 milligrams.” Neal, 516 U. S., at 287 (citing\nUSSG §2D1.1(c), n. (H) (Nov. 1995)). The Commission’s\nchange significantly lowered the Guidelines range appli­\ncable to most LSD offenses, but defendants remained\nsubject to higher statutory minimum sentences based on\nthe combined weight of the pure drug and its carrier me­\ndium. The defendant in Neal argued that the revised\nGuidelines and the statute should be interpreted consis­\ntently and that the “presumptive-weight method of the\nGuidelines should also control the mandatory minimum\ncalculation.” 516 U. S., at 287. We rejected that argu­\nment, emphasizing that the Commission had not pur­\nported to interpret the statute and could not in any event\noverrule our decision in Chapman. See 516 U. S., at 293–\n295.\n   If the Government’s current position were correct, then\nthe Guidelines involved in Neal would be in serious jeop­\nardy. We have just recounted the reasons alleged to\njustify reading into the 1986 Act an implicit command to\nthe Commission and sentencing courts to apply the\n100-to-1 ratio to all quantities of crack cocaine. Those\nsame reasons could be urged in support of an argument\nthat the 1986 Act requires the Commission to include the\nfull weight of the carrier medium in calculating the\nweight of LSD for Guidelines purposes. Yet our opinion\nin Neal never questioned the validity of the altered\nGuidelines. To the contrary, we stated: “Entrusted within\nits sphere to make policy judgments, the Commission may\n16                KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nabandon its old methods in favor of what it has deemed a\nmore desirable ‘approach’ to calculating LSD quantities.”\nId., at 295.14 If the 1986 Act does not require the Commis­\nsion to adhere to the Act’s method for determining LSD\nweights, it does not require the Commission—or, after\nBooker, sentencing courts—to adhere to the 100-to-1 ratio\nfor crack cocaine quantities other than those that trigger\nthe statutory mandatory minimum sentences.\n                              B\n   In addition to the 1986 Act, the Government relies on\nCongress’ disapproval of the Guidelines amendment that\nthe Sentencing Commission proposed in 1995. Congress\n“not only disapproved of the 1:1 ratio,” the Government\nurges; it also made clear “that the 1986 Act required the\nCommission (and sentencing courts) to take drug quanti­\nties into account, and to do so in a manner that respects\nthe 100:1 ratio.” Brief for United States 35.\n   It is true that Congress rejected the Commission’s 1995\nproposal to place a 1-to-1 ratio in the Guidelines, and that\nCongress also expressed the view that “the sentence im­\nposed for trafficking in a quantity of crack cocaine should\n——————\n  14 At oral argument, the Government sought to distinguish Neal v.\n\nUnited States, 516 U. S. 284 (1996), on the ground that the validity of\nthe amended Guidelines was not before us in that case. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 25. That is true, but only because the Government did not chal­\nlenge the amendment. In fact, the Government’s brief appeared to\nacknowledge that the Commission may legitimately deviate from the\npolicies and methods embodied in the 1986 Act, even if the deviation\nproduces some inconsistency. See Brief for United States in Neal v.\nUnited States, O. T. 1995, No. 94–9088, p. 26 (“When the Commission’s\nviews about sentencing policy depart from those of Congress, it may\nbecome difficult to achieve entirely consistent sentencing, but that is a\nmatter for Congress, not the courts, to address.”). Moreover, our\nopinion in Neal assumed that the amendment was a legitimate exercise\nof the Commission’s authority. See 516 U. S., at 294 (noting with\napparent approval the Commission’s position that “the Guidelines\ncalculation is independent of the statutory calculation”).\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngenerally exceed the sentence imposed for trafficking in a\nlike quantity of powder cocaine.”          Pub. L. 104–38,\n§2(a)(1)(A), 109 Stat. 334. But nothing in Congress’ 1995\nreaction to the Commission-proposed 1-to-1 ratio sug­\ngested that crack sentences must exceed powder sentences\nby a ratio of 100 to 1. To the contrary, Congress’ 1995\naction required the Commission to recommend a “revision\nof the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder co­\ncaine.” §2(a)(2), id., at 335.\n   The Government emphasizes that Congress required the\nCommission to propose changes to the 100-to-1 ratio in\nboth the 1986 Act and the Guidelines. This requirement,\nthe Government contends, implicitly foreclosed any devia­\ntion from the 100-to-1 ratio in the Guidelines (or by sen­\ntencing courts) in the absence of a corresponding change\nin the statute. See Brief for United States 35–36. But it\ndoes not follow as the night follows the day that, by calling\nfor recommendations to change the statute, Congress\nmeant to bar any Guidelines alteration in advance of\ncongressional action. The more likely reading is that\nCongress sought proposals to amend both the statute and\nthe Guidelines because the Commission’s criticisms of the\n100-to-1 ratio, see Part II–B, supra, concerned the exorbi­\ntance of the crack/powder disparity in both contexts.\n   Moreover, as a result of the 2007 amendment, see supra,\nat 10–11, the Guidelines now advance a crack/powder\nratio that varies (at different offense levels) between 25 to\n1 and 80 to 1. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guide­\nlines for United States Courts, 72 Fed. Reg. 28571–28572.\nAdopting the Government’s analysis, the amended Guide­\nlines would conflict with Congress’ 1995 action, and with\nthe 1986 Act, because the current Guidelines ratios devi­\nate from the 100-to-1 statutory ratio. Congress, however,\ndid not disapprove or modify the Commission-initiated\n2007 amendment. Ordinarily, we resist reading congres­\nsional intent into congressional inaction. See Bob Jones\n18            KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUniv. v. United States, 461 U. S. 574, 600 (1983). But in\nthis case, Congress failed to act on a proposed amendment\nto the Guidelines in a high-profile area in which it had\npreviously exercised its disapproval authority under 28\nU. S. C. §994(p). If nothing else, this tacit acceptance of\nthe 2007 amendment undermines the Government’s posi­\ntion, which is itself based on implications drawn from\ncongressional silence.\n                             C\n   Finally, the Government argues that if district courts\nare free to deviate from the Guidelines based on disagree­\nments with the crack/powder ratio, unwarranted dispari­\nties of two kinds will ensue. See 18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(6)\n(sentencing courts shall consider “the need to avoid un­\nwarranted sentence disparities”). First, because sentenc­\ning courts remain bound by the mandatory minimum\nsentences prescribed in the 1986 Act, deviations from the\n100-to-1 ratio could result in sentencing “cliffs” around\nquantities that trigger the mandatory minimums. Brief\nfor United States 33 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nFor example, a district court could grant a sizable down­\nward variance to a defendant convicted of distributing 49\ngrams of crack but would be required by the statutory\nminimum to impose a much higher sentence on a defen­\ndant responsible for only 1 additional gram. Second, the\nGovernment maintains that, if district courts are permit­\nted to vary from the Guidelines based on their disagree­\nment with the crack/powder disparity, “defendants with\nidentical real conduct will receive markedly different\nsentences, depending on nothing more than the particular\njudge drawn for sentencing.” Id., at 40.\n   Neither of these arguments persuades us to hold the\ncrack/powder ratio untouchable by sentencing courts. As\nto the first, the LSD Guidelines we approved in Neal\ncreate a similar risk of sentencing “cliffs.” An offender\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                   19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwho possesses LSD on a carrier medium weighing ten\ngrams is subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum, see\n21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(A)(v), but an offender whose carrier\nmedium weighs slightly less may receive a considerably\nlower sentence based on the Guidelines’ presumptive-\nweight methodology. Concerning the second disparity, it\nis unquestioned that uniformity remains an important\ngoal of sentencing. As we explained in Booker, however,\nadvisory Guidelines combined with appellate review for\nreasonableness and ongoing revision of the Guidelines in\nresponse to sentencing practices will help to “avoid exces­\nsive sentencing disparities.” 543 U. S., at 264. These\nmeasures will not eliminate variations between district\ncourts, but our opinion in Booker recognized that some\ndepartures from uniformity were a necessary cost of the\nremedy we adopted. See id., at 263 (“We cannot and do\nnot claim that use of a ‘reasonableness’ standard will\nprovide the uniformity that Congress originally sought to\nsecure [through mandatory Guidelines].”). And as to crack\ncocaine sentences in particular, we note a congressional\ncontrol on disparities: possible variations among district\ncourts are constrained by the mandatory minimums Con­\ngress prescribed in the 1986 Act.15\n  Moreover, to the extent that the Government correctly\nidentifies risks of “unwarranted sentence disparities”\nwithin the meaning of 18 U. S. C. §3353(a)(6), the proper\nsolution is not to treat the crack/powder ratio as manda­\ntory. Section 3553(a)(6) directs district courts to consider\nthe need to avoid unwarranted disparities—along with\nother §3553(a) factors—when imposing sentences. See\nGall, ante, at 11, n. 6, 16. Under this instruction, district\n\n——————\n  15 The  Sentencing Commission reports that roughly 70% of crack\noffenders are responsible for drug quantities that yield base offense\nlevels at or only two levels above those that correspond to the statutory\nminimums.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts must take account of sentencing practices in other\ncourts and the “cliffs” resulting from the statutory manda­\ntory minimum sentences. To reach an appropriate sen­\ntence, these disparities must be weighed against the other\n§3553(a) factors and any unwarranted disparity created by\nthe crack/powder ratio itself.\n                             IV\n   While rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory,\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 245 (2005), we\nhave nevertheless preserved a key role for the Sentencing\nCommission. As explained in Rita and Gall, district\ncourts must treat the Guidelines as the “starting point and\nthe initial benchmark,” Gall v. United States, ante, at 11.\nCongress established the Commission to formulate and\nconstantly refine national sentencing standards. See Rita\nv. United States, 551 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2007) (slip op., at\n9–11). Carrying out its charge, the Commission fills an\nimportant institutional role: It has the capacity courts lack\nto “base its determinations on empirical data and national\nexperience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate\nexpertise.” United States v. Pruitt, 502 F. 3d 1154, 1171\n(CA10 2007) (McConnell, J., concurring); see supra, at 7.\n   We have accordingly recognized that, in the ordinary\ncase, the Commission’s recommendation of a sentencing\nrange will “reflect a rough approximation of sentences that\nmight achieve §3553(a)’s objectives.” Rita, 551 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 11). The sentencing judge, on the other\nhand, has “greater familiarity with . . . the individual case\nand the individual defendant before him than the Com­\nmission or the appeals court.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\nHe is therefore “in a superior position to find facts and\njudge their import under §3353(a)” in each particular case.\nGall, ante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted). In\nlight of these discrete institutional strengths, a district\ncourt’s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a\nparticular case “outside the ‘heartland’ to which the Com­\nmission intends individual Guidelines to apply.” Rita, 551\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). On the other hand, while the\nGuidelines are no longer binding, closer review may be in\norder when the sentencing judge varies from the Guide­\nlines based solely on the judge’s view that the Guidelines\nrange “fails properly to reflect §3553(a) considerations”\neven in a mine-run case. Ibid. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. in Gall\nv. United States, O. T. 2007, No. 06-7949, pp. 38–39.\n   The crack cocaine Guidelines, however, present no\noccasion for elaborative discussion of this matter because\nthose Guidelines do not exemplify the Commission’s exer­\ncise of its characteristic institutional role. In formulating\nGuidelines ranges for crack cocaine offenses, as we earlier\nnoted, the Commission looked to the mandatory minimum\nsentences set in the 1986 Act, and did not take account of\n“empirical data and national experience.” See Pruitt, 502\nF. 3d, at 1171 (McConnell, J., concurring). Indeed, the\nCommission itself has reported that the crack/powder\ndisparity produces disproportionately harsh sanctions, i.e.,\nsentences for crack cocaine offenses “greater than neces­\nsary” in light of the purposes of sentencing set forth in\n§3553(a). See supra, at 8–9. Given all this, it would not\nbe an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude\nwhen sentencing a particular defendant that the\ncrack/powder disparity yields a sentence “greater than\nnecessary” to achieve §3553(a)’s purposes, even in a mine­\nrun case.\n                             V\n  Taking account of the foregoing discussion in appraising\nthe District Court’s disposition in this case, we conclude\nthat the 180-month sentence imposed on Kimbrough\nshould survive appellate inspection. The District Court\nbegan by properly calculating and considering the advi­\n22            KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsory Guidelines range. It then addressed the relevant\n§3553(a) factors. First, the court considered “the nature\nand circumstances” of the crime, see 18 U. S. C.\n§3553(a)(1), which was an unremarkable drug-trafficking\noffense. App. 72–73 (“[T]his defendant and another defen­\ndant were caught sitting in a car with some crack cocaine\nand powder by two police officers—that’s the sum and\nsubstance of it—[and they also had] a firearm.”). Second,\nthe court considered Kimbrough’s “history and character­\nistics.” §3553(a)(1). The court noted that Kimbrough had\nno prior felony convictions, that he had served in combat\nduring Operation Desert Storm and received an honorable\ndischarge from the Marine Corps, and that he had a\nsteady history of employment.\n   Furthermore, the court alluded to the Sentencing Com­\nmission’s reports criticizing the 100-to-1 ratio, cf.\n§3553(a)(5) (Supp. V), noting that the Commission “recog­\nnizes that crack cocaine has not caused the damage that\nthe Justice Department alleges it has.” App. 72. Compar­\ning the Guidelines range to the range that would have\napplied if Kimbrough had possessed an equal amount of\npowder, the court suggested that the 100-to-1 ratio itself\ncreated an unwarranted disparity within the meaning of\n§3553(a). Finally, the court did not purport to establish a\nratio of its own. Rather, it appropriately framed its final\ndetermination in line with §3553(a)’s overarching instruc­\ntion to “impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than\nnecessary” to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in\n§3553(a)(2). See supra, at 12. Concluding that “the crack\ncocaine guidelines [drove] the offense level to a point\nhigher than is necessary to do justice in this case,” App.\n72, the District Court thus rested its sentence on the\nappropriate considerations and “committed no procedural\nerror,” Gall v. United States, ante, at 17.\n   The ultimate question in Kimbrough’s case is “whether\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe sentence was reasonable—i.e., whether the District\nJudge abused his discretion in determining that the\n§3553(a) factors supported a sentence of [15 years] and\njustified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines\nrange.” Ibid. The sentence the District Court imposed on\nKimbrough was 4.5 years below the bottom of the Guide­\nlines range. But in determining that 15 years was the\nappropriate prison term, the District Court properly\nhomed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbrough’s\ncase and accorded weight to the Sentencing Commission’s\nconsistent and emphatic position that the crack/powder\ndisparity is at odds with §3553(a). See Part II–B, supra.\nIndeed, aside from its claim that the 100-to-1 ratio is\nmandatory, the Government did not attack the District\nCourt’s downward variance as unsupported by §3553(a).\nGiving due respect to the District Court’s reasoned ap­\npraisal, a reviewing court could not rationally conclude\nthat the 4.5-year sentence reduction Kimbrough received\nqualified as an abuse of discretion.

I join the opinion only because I do not\ntake this to be an unannounced abandonment of the fol\nlowing clear statements in our recent opinions:\n    “[Our remedial opinion] requires a sentencing court to\n    consider Guidelines ranges, . . . but it permits the\n    court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory\n    concerns as well, see §3553(a).\n        .            .         .            .          .\n    “[W]ithout this provision—namely the provision that\n    makes ‘the relevant sentencing rules . . . mandatory\n    and impose[s] binding requirements on all sentencing\n    judges’—the statute falls outside the scope of re\n    quirement.\n        .            .         .            .          .\n    “The district courts, while not bound to apply the\n    Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take\n2             KIMBROUGH v.

S. 220, 245–246, 259, 264 (2005).\n       “Under the system described in JUSTICE BREYER’s\n    opinion for the Court in Booker, judges would no\n    longer be tied to the sentencing range indicated in the\n    Guidelines. But they would be obliged to ‘take ac\n    count of’ that range along with the sentencing goals\n    Congress enumerated in the SRA at 18 U. S. C.\n    §3553(a).” Cunningham v. California, 549 U.

As far as the law is\n    concerned, the judge could disregard the Guidelines\n    and apply the same sentence (higher than the statu\n    tory minimum or the bottom of the unenhanced\n    Guidelines range) in the absence of the special facts\n    (say, gun brandishing) which, in the view of the Sen\n    tencing Commission, would warrant a higher sentence\n    within the statutorily permissible range.” Rita, supra,\n    at ___ (slip op., at 12, 14).\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

If there is any thumb on the scales; if the\nGuidelines must be followed even where the district\ncourt’s application of the §3553(a) factors is entirely rea\nsonable; then the “advisory” Guidelines would, over a\nlarge expanse of their application, entitle the defendant to\na lesser sentence but for the presence of certain additional\nfacts found by judge rather than jury. This, as we said in\nBooker, would violate the Sixth Amendment.\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 258–265 (2005).\nThe Court’s post-Booker sentencing cases illustrate why\nthe remedial majority in Booker was mistaken to craft a\nremedy far broader than necessary to correct constitu\ntional error. The Court is now confronted with a host of\nquestions about how to administer a sentencing scheme\nthat has no basis in the statute. Because the Court’s\ndecisions in this area are necessarily grounded in policy\nconsiderations rather than law, I respectfully dissent.\n   In Booker, the Court held that the Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines violate the Sixth Amendment insofar as they\npermit a judge to make findings that raise a sentence\nbeyond the level justified by the “ ‘facts reflected in the\njury verdict or admitted by the defendant.’ ” Id., at 232\n(quoting Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 303 (2004)\n(emphasis deleted)). In my view, this violation was more\nsuitably remedied by requiring any such facts to be sub\nmitted to the jury. Booker, 543 U. S., at 323–325\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting in part). That approach would\nhave been consistent with our longstanding presumption\nof the severability of unconstitutional applications of\nstatutory provisions. Id., at 322–323 (THOMAS, J., dissent\ning in part). And it would have achieved compliance with\n2              KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe Sixth Amendment while doing the least amount of\nviolence to the mandatory sentencing regime that Con\ngress enacted. Id., at 324–326 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in\npart). The Court, however, chose a more sweeping rem\nedy. Despite acknowledging that under the mandatory\nGuidelines not “every sentence gives rise to a Sixth\nAmendment violation,” the Court rendered the Guidelines\nadvisory in their entirety and mandated appellate review\nof all sentences for “reasonableness.” Id., at 268. Because\nthe Court’s “solution fail[ed] to tailor the remedy to the\nwrong,” I dissented from the remedial opinion. Id., at 313.\n   As a result of the Court’s remedial approach, we are now\ncalled upon to decide a multiplicity of questions that have\nno discernibly legal answers. Last Term, in Rita v. United\nStates, 551 U. S. __ (2007), the Court held that a Court of\nAppeals may treat sentences within the properly calcu\nlated Guidelines range as presumptively reasonable.\nToday, in Gall v. United States, ante, p. __, the Court holds\nthat a Court of Appeals may not require sentences that\ndeviate substantially from the Guidelines range to be\njustified by extraordinary circumstances. And here the\nCourt holds that sentencing courts are free to reject the\nSentencing Guidelines’ 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio.\n   These outcomes may be perfectly reasonable as a matter\nof policy, but they have no basis in law. Congress did not\nmandate a reasonableness standard of appellate review—\nthat was a standard the remedial majority in Booker\nfashioned out of whole cloth. See 543 U. S., at 307–312\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting in part). The Court must now give\ncontent to that standard, but in so doing it does not and\ncannot rely on any statutory language or congressional\nintent. We are asked here to determine whether, under\nthe new advisory Guidelines regime, district courts may\nimpose sentences based in part on their disagreement with\na categorical policy judgment reflected in the Guidelines.\nBut the Court’s answer to that question necessarily de\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)             3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nrives from something other than the statutory language or\ncongressional intent because Congress, by making the\nGuidelines mandatory, quite clearly intended to bind\ndistrict courts to the Sentencing Commission’s categorical\npolicy judgments. See 18 U. S. C. §3553(b) (2000 ed. and\nSupp. V) (excised by Booker). By rejecting this statutory\napproach, the Booker remedial majority has left the Court\nwith no law to apply and forced it to assume the legislative\nrole of devising a new sentencing scheme.\n  Although I joined JUSTICE SCALIA’s dissent in Rita\naccepting the Booker remedial opinion as a matter of\n“statutory stare decisis,” 551 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 2), I\nam now convinced that there is no principled way to apply\nthe Booker remedy—certainly not one based on the stat\nute. Accordingly, I think it best to apply the statute as\nwritten, including 18 U. S. C. §3553(b), which makes the\nGuidelines mandatory. Cf. Dickerson v. United States, 530\nU. S. 428, 465 (2000) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n  Applying the statute as written, it is clear that the\nDistrict Court erred by departing below the mandatory\nGuidelines range. I would therefore affirm the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals vacating petitioner’s sentence and\nremanding for resentencing.\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

Booker, 543 U. S.\n220, 258–265 (2005), a district judge is still required to\ngive significant weight to the policy decisions embodied in\nthe Guidelines. The Booker remedial decision, however,\ndoes not permit a court of appeals to treat the Guidelines’\npolicy decisions as binding. I would not draw a distinction\nbetween the Guideline at issue here and other Guidelines.\nAccordingly, I would vacate the decision of the Court of\nAppeals and remand for reconsideration.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145841/", "sha1": "47724adf707d56496c29519ab81193b9ddeb886e", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2007-007", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:23"}
