The first, <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), involved a sentence <i>within</i> the range recommended by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines; we held that when a district judge's discretionary decision in a particular case accords with the sentence the United States Sentencing Commission deems appropriate \"in the mine run of cases,\" the court of appeals may presume that the sentence is reasonable. <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2465.</p>\n<p>The second case, <i>Claiborne v. United States</i><i>,</i> involved a sentence <i>below</i> the range recommended by the Guidelines, and raised the converse question whether a court of appeals may apply a \"proportionality test,\" and require that a sentence that constitutes a substantial variance from the Guidelines be justified by extraordinary circumstances. See <i>Claiborne v. United States,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006). We did not have the opportunity to answer this question because the case was mooted by Claiborne's untimely death. <i>Claiborne v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2245, 167 L.Ed.2d 1080 (2007) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> We granted certiorari in the case before us today in order to reach that question, left unanswered last Term. 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2933, 168 L.Ed.2d 261 (2007). We now hold that, while the extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range is surely relevant, courts of appeals must review all sentences \u0097 whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range \u0097 under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. We also hold that the sentence imposed by the experienced District Judge in this case was reasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In February or March 2000, petitioner Brian Gall, a second-year college student at the University of Iowa, was invited by Luke Rinderknecht to join an ongoing enterprise <span class=\"star-pagination\">*592</span> distributing a controlled substance popularly known as \"ecstasy.\"<sup>[1]</sup> Gall \u0097 who was then a user of ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana \u0097 accepted the invitation. During the ensuing seven months, Gall delivered ecstasy pills, which he received from Rinderknecht, to other conspirators, who then sold them to consumers. He netted over $30,000.</p>\n<p>A month or two after joining the conspiracy, Gall stopped using ecstasy. A few months after that, in September 2000, he advised Rinderknecht and other co-conspirators that he was withdrawing from the conspiracy. He has not sold illegal drugs of any kind since. He has, in the words of the District Court, \"self-rehabilitated.\" App. 75. He graduated from the University of Iowa in 2002, and moved first to Arizona, where he obtained a job in the construction industry, and later to Colorado, where he earned $18 per hour as a master carpenter. He has not used any illegal drugs since graduating from college.</p>\n<p>After Gall moved to Arizona, he was approached by federal law enforcement agents who questioned him about his involvement in the ecstasy distribution conspiracy. Gall admitted his limited participation in the distribution of ecstasy, and the agents took no further action at that time. On April 28, 2004 \u0097 approximately a year and a half after this initial interview, and three and a half years after Gall withdrew from the conspiracy \u0097 an indictment was returned in the Southern District of Iowa charging him and seven other defendants with participating in a conspiracy to distribute ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana, that began in or about May 1996 and continued through October 30, 2002. The Government has never questioned the truthfulness of any of Gall's earlier statements or contended that he played any role in, or had any knowledge of, other aspects of the conspiracy described in the indictment. When he received notice of the indictment, Gall moved back to Iowa and surrendered to the authorities. While free on his own recognizance, Gall started his own business in the construction industry, primarily engaged in subcontracting for the installation of windows and doors. In his first year, his profits were over $2,000 per month.</p>\n<p>Gall entered into a plea agreement with the Government, stipulating that he was \"responsible for, but did not necessarily distribute himself, at least 2,500 grams of [ecstasy], or the equivalent of at least 87.5 kilograms of marijuana.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 25. In the agreement, the Government acknowledged that by \"on or about September of 2000,\" Gall had communicated his intent to stop distributing ecstasy to Rinderknecht and other members of the conspiracy. <i>Ibid.</i> The agreement further provided that recent changes in the Guidelines that enhanced the recommended punishment for distributing ecstasy were not applicable to Gall because he had withdrawn from the conspiracy prior to the effective date of those changes.</p>\n<p>In her presentence report, the probation officer concluded that Gall had no significant criminal history; that he was not an organizer, leader, or manager; and that his offense did not involve the use of any weapons. The report stated that Gall had truthfully provided the Government with all of the evidence he had concerning the alleged offenses, but that his evidence was not useful because he provided no new information to the agents. The report also described Gall's substantial use of drugs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*593</span> prior to his offense and the absence of any such use in recent years. The report recommended a sentencing range of 30 to 37 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The record of the sentencing hearing held on May 27, 2005, includes a \"small flood\" of letters from Gall's parents and other relatives, his fiance, neighbors, and representatives of firms doing business with him, uniformly praising his character and work ethic. The transcript includes the testimony of several witnesses and the District Judge's colloquy with the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) and with Gall. The AUSA did not contest any of the evidence concerning Gall's law-abiding life during the preceding five years, but urged that \"the Guidelines are appropriate and should be followed,\" and requested that the court impose a prison sentence within the Guidelines range. <i>Id.,</i> at 93. He mentioned that two of Gall's coconspirators had been sentenced to 30 and 35 months, respectively, but upon further questioning by the District Court, he acknowledged that neither of them had voluntarily withdrawn from the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>The District Judge sentenced Gall to probation for a term of 36 months. In addition to making a lengthy statement on the record, the judge filed a detailed sentencing memorandum explaining his decision, and provided the following statement of reasons in his written judgment:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Court determined that, considering all the factors under 18 U.S.C. 3553(a), the Defendant's explicit withdrawal from the conspiracy almost four years before the filing of the Indictment, the Defendant's post-offense conduct, especially obtaining a college degree and the start of his own successful business, the support of family and friends, lack of criminal history, and his age at the time of the offense conduct, all warrant the sentence imposed, which was sufficient, but not greater than necessary to serve the purposes of sentencing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 117.</blockquote>\n<p>At the end of both the sentencing hearing and the sentencing memorandum, the District Judge reminded Gall that probation, rather than \"an act of leniency,\" is a \"substantial restriction of freedom.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 99, 125. In the memorandum, he emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Gall] will have to comply with strict reporting conditions along with a three-year regime of alcohol and drug testing. He will not be able to change or make decisions about significant circumstances in his life, such as where to live or work, which are prized liberty interests, without first seeking authorization from his Probation Officer or, perhaps, even the Court. Of course, the Defendant always faces the harsh consequences that await if he violates the conditions of his probationary term.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 125.</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the District Judge explained why he had concluded that the sentence of probation reflected the seriousness of Gall's offense and that no term of imprisonment was necessary:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Any term of imprisonment in this case would be counter effective by depriving society of the contributions of the Defendant who, the Court has found, understands the consequences of his criminal conduct and is doing everything in his power to forge a new life. The Defendant's post-offense conduct indicates neither that he will return to criminal behavior nor that the Defendant is a danger to society. In fact, the Defendant's post-offense conduct was not motivated by a desire to please the Court or any other governmental agency, but was the pre-Indictment product of the Defendant's own desire to lead a better life.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 125-126.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*594</span> II</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for resentencing. Relying on its earlier opinion in <i>United States v. Claiborne,</i> 439 F.3d 479 (C.A.8 2006), it held that a sentence outside of the Guidelines range must be supported by a justification that \"`\"is proportional to the extent of the difference between the advisory range and the sentence imposed.\"'\" 446 F.3d 884, 889 (C.A.8 2006) (quoting <i>Claiborne,</i> 439 F.3d, at 481, in turn quoting <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 427 F.3d 423, 426-427 (C.A.7 2005)). Characterizing the difference between a sentence of probation and the bottom of Gall's advisory Guidelines range of 30 months as \"extraordinary\" because it amounted to \"a 100% downward variance,\" 446 F.3d, at 889, the Court of Appeals held that such a variance must be \u0097 and here was not \u0097 supported by extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p>Rather than making an attempt to quantify the value of the justifications provided by the District Judge, the Court of Appeals identified what it regarded as five separate errors in the District Judge's reasoning: (1) He gave \"too much weight to Gall's withdrawal from the conspiracy\"; (2) given that Gall was 21 at the time of his offense, the District Judge erroneously gave \"significant weight\" to studies showing impetuous behavior by persons under the age of 18; (3) he did not \"properly weigh\" the seriousness of Gall's offense; (4) he failed to consider whether a sentence of probation would result in \"unwarranted\" disparities; and (5) he placed \"too much emphasis on Gall's post-offense rehabilitation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 889-890. As we shall explain, we are not persuaded that these factors, whether viewed separately or in the aggregate, are sufficient to support the conclusion that the District Judge abused his discretion. As a preface to our discussion of these particulars, however, we shall explain why the Court of Appeals' rule requiring \"proportional\" justifications for departures from the Guidelines range is not consistent with our remedial opinion in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In <i>Booker</i> we invalidated both the statutory provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which made the Sentencing Guidelines mandatory, and \u00a7 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which directed appellate courts to apply a <i>de novo</i> standard of review to departures from the Guidelines. As a result of our decision, the Guidelines are now advisory, and appellate review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are \"reasonable.\" Our explanation of \"reasonableness\" review in the <i>Booker</i> opinion made it pellucidly clear that the familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions. See 543 U.S., at 260-262, 125 S.Ct. 738; see also <i>Rita,</i> 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456 (STEVENS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>It is also clear that a district judge must give serious consideration to the extent of any departure from the Guidelines and must explain his conclusion that an unusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence is appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications. For even though the Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory, they are, as we pointed out in <i>Rita,</i> the product of careful study based on extensive empirical evidence derived from the review of thousands of individual sentencing decisions.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p>In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the Guidelines range, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*595</span> appellate courts may therefore take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines. We reject, however, an appellate rule that requires \"extraordinary\" circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range. We also reject the use of a rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the approaches we reject come too close to creating an impermissible presumption of unreasonableness for sentences outside the Guidelines range. See <i>id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2467 (\"The fact that we permit courts of appeals to adopt a presumption of reasonableness does not mean that courts may adopt a presumption of unreasonableness\").<sup>[3]</sup> Even the Government has acknowledged that such a presumption would not be consistent with <i>Booker.</i> See Brief for United States in <i>Rita v. United States</i><i>,</i> O.T.2006, No. 06-5754, pp. 34-35.</p>\n<p>The mathematical approach also suffers from infirmities of application. On one side of the equation, deviations from the Guidelines range will always appear more extreme \u0097 in percentage terms \u0097 when the range itself is low, and a sentence of probation will always be a 100% departure regardless of whether the Guidelines range is 1 month or 100 years. Moreover, quantifying the variance as a certain percentage of the maximum, minimum, or median prison sentence recommended by the Guidelines gives no weight to the \"substantial restriction of freedom\" involved in a term of supervised release or probation. App. 95.</p>\n<p>We recognize that custodial sentences are qualitatively more severe than probationary sentences of equivalent terms. Offenders on probation are nonetheless subject to several standard conditions that substantially restrict their liberty. See <i>United States v. Knights,</i> 534 U.S. 112, 119, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001) (\"Inherent in the very nature of probation is that probationers `do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled'\" (quoting <i>Griffin v. Wisconsin,</i> 483 U.S. 868, 874, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987))).<sup>[4]</sup> Probationers may not leave <span class=\"star-pagination\">*596</span> the judicial district, move, or change jobs without notifying, and in some cases receiving permission from, their probation officer or the court. They must report regularly to their probation officer, permit unannounced visits to their homes, refrain from associating with any person convicted of a felony, and refrain from excessive drinking. USSG \u00a7 5B1.3. Most probationers are also subject to individual \"special conditions\" imposed by the court. Gall, for instance, may not patronize any establishment that derives more than 50% of its revenue from the sale of alcohol, and must submit to random drug tests as directed by his probation officer. App. 109.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the equation, the mathematical approach assumes the existence of some ascertainable method of assigning percentages to various justifications. Does withdrawal from a conspiracy justify more or less than, say, a 30% reduction? Does it matter that the withdrawal occurred several years ago? Is it relevant that the withdrawal was motivated by a decision to discontinue the use of drugs and to lead a better life? What percentage, if any, should be assigned to evidence that a defendant poses no future threat to society, or to evidence that innocent third parties are dependent on him? The formula is a classic example of attempting to measure an inventory of apples by counting oranges.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Most importantly, both the exceptional circumstances requirement and the rigid mathematical formulation reflect a practice \u0097 common among courts that have adopted \"proportional review\" \u0097 of applying a heightened standard of review to sentences outside the Guidelines range. This is inconsistent with the rule that the abuse-of-discretion standard of review applies to appellate review of all sentencing decisions \u0097 whether inside or outside the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p>As we explained in <i>Rita,</i> a district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range. See 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456. As a matter of administration and to secure nationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark. The Guidelines are not the only consideration, however. Accordingly, after giving both parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate, the district judge should then consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.<sup>[6]</sup> In so doing, he may not presume <span class=\"star-pagination\">*597</span> that the Guidelines range is reasonable. See <i>id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456. He must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented. If he decides that an outside-Guidelines sentence is warranted, he must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance. We find it uncontroversial that a major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one. After settling on the appropriate sentence, he must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing. <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. It must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u0097 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range. Assuming that the district court's sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. When conducting this review, the court will, of course, take into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range. If the sentence is within the Guidelines range, the appellate court may, but is not required to, apply a presumption of reasonableness. <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456. But if the sentence is outside the Guidelines range, the court may not apply a presumption of unreasonableness. It may consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court's decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance. The fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.</p>\n<p>Practical considerations also underlie this legal principle. \"The sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) in the individual case. The judge sees and hears the evidence, makes credibility determinations, has full knowledge of the facts and gains insights not conveyed by the record.\" Brief for Federal Public and Community Defenders et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 16. \"The sentencing judge has access to, and greater familiarity with, the individual case and the individual defendant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*598</span> before him than the Commission or the appeals court.\" <i>Rita,</i> 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2469. Moreover, \"[d]istrict courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations, especially as they see so many more Guidelines sentences than appellate courts do.\" <i>Koon v. United States,</i> 518 U.S. 81, 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>\"It has been uniform and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 113, 116 S.Ct. 2035.<sup>[8]</sup> The uniqueness of the individual case, however, does not change the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review that applies to all sentencing decisions. As we shall now explain, the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case does not reflect the requisite deference and does not support the conclusion that the District Court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>As an initial matter, we note that the District Judge committed no significant procedural error. He correctly calculated the applicable Guidelines range, allowed both parties to present arguments as to what they believed the appropriate sentence should be, considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and thoroughly documented his reasoning. The Court of Appeals found that the District Judge erred in failing to give proper weight to the seriousness of the offense, as required by \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and failing to consider whether a sentence of probation would create unwarranted disparities, as required by \u00a7 3553(a)(6). We disagree.</p>\n<p>Section 3553(a)(2)(A) requires judges to consider \"the need for the sentence imposed... to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\" The Court of Appeals concluded that \"the district court did not properly weigh the seriousness of Gall's offense\" because it \"ignored the serious health risks ecstasy poses.\" 446 F.3d, at 890. Contrary to the Court of Appeals' conclusion, the District Judge plainly did consider the seriousness of the offense. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. 99 (\"The Court, however, is bound to impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness <span class=\"star-pagination\">*599</span> of joining a conspiracy to distribute MDMA or ecstasy\"); <i>id.,</i> at 122.<sup>[9]</sup> It is true that the District Judge did not make specific reference to the (unquestionably significant) health risks posed by ecstasy, but the prosecutor did not raise ecstasy's effects at the sentencing hearing. Had the prosecutor raised the issue, specific discussion of the point might have been in order, but it was not incumbent on the District Judge to raise every conceivably relevant issue on his own initiative.</p>\n<p>The Government's legitimate concern that a lenient sentence for a serious offense threatens to promote disrespect for the law is at least to some extent offset by the fact that seven of the eight defendants in this case have been sentenced to significant prison terms. Moreover, the unique facts of Gall's situation provide support for the District Judge's conclusion that, in Gall's case, \"a sentence of imprisonment may work to promote not respect, but derision, of the law if the law is viewed as merely a means to dispense harsh punishment without taking into account the real conduct and circumstances involved in sentencing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 126.</p>\n<p>Section 3553(a)(6) requires judges to consider \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\" The Court of Appeals stated that \"the record does not show that the district court considered whether a sentence of probation would result in unwarranted disparities.\" 446 F.3d, at 890. As with the seriousness of the offense conduct, avoidance of unwarranted disparities was clearly considered by the Sentencing Commission when setting the Guidelines ranges. Since the District Judge correctly calculated and carefully reviewed the Guidelines range, he necessarily gave significant weight and consideration to the need to avoid unwarranted disparities.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as we understand the colloquy between the District Judge and the AUSA, it seems that the judge gave specific attention to the issue of disparity when he inquired about the sentences already imposed by a different judge on two of Gall's codefendants. The AUSA advised the District Judge that defendant Harbison had received a 30-month sentence and that Gooding had received 35 months. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: ... You probably know more about this than anybody. How long did those two stay in the conspiracy, and did they voluntarily withdraw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"MR GRIESS: They did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: They did not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"MR. GRIESS: They did not voluntarily withdraw. And they were in the conspiracy, I think, for a shorter period of time, but at the very end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"MR. GRIESS: A significant difference there, Your Honor, is that they were in the conspiracy after the guidelines changed and, therefore, were sentenced at a much higher level because of that.\" App. 88.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*600</span> A little later Mr. Griess stated: \"The last thing I want to talk about goes to sentencing disparity. ... Obviously, the Court is cognizant of that and wants to avoid any unwarranted sentencing disparities.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 89. He then discussed at some length the sentence of 36 months imposed on another codefendant, Jarod Yoder, whose participation in the conspiracy was roughly comparable to Gall's. Griess voluntarily acknowledged three differences between Yoder and Gall: Yoder was in the conspiracy at its end and therefore was sentenced under the more severe Guidelines, he had a more serious criminal history, and he did not withdraw from the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>From these facts, it is perfectly clear that the District Judge considered the need to avoid unwarranted disparities, but also considered the need to avoid unwarranted <i>similarities</i> among other co-conspirators who were not similarly situated. The District Judge regarded Gall's voluntary withdrawal as a reasonable basis for giving him a less severe sentence than the three codefendants discussed with the AUSA, who neither withdrew from the conspiracy nor rehabilitated themselves as Gall had done. We also note that neither the Court of Appeals nor the Government has called our attention to a comparable defendant who received a more severe sentence.</p>\n<p>Since the District Court committed no procedural error, the only question for the Court of Appeals was whether the sentence was reasonable \u0097 <i>i.e.,</i> whether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported a sentence of probation and justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range. As we shall now explain, the sentence was reasonable. The Court of Appeals' decision to the contrary was incorrect and failed to demonstrate the requisite deference to the District Judge's decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals gave virtually no deference to the District Court's decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justified a significant variance in this case. Although the Court of Appeals correctly stated that the appropriate standard of review was abuse of discretion, it engaged in an analysis that more closely resembled <i>de novo</i> review of the facts presented and determined that, in its view, the degree of variance was not warranted.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals thought that the District Court \"gave too much weight to Gall's withdrawal from the conspiracy because the court failed to acknowledge the significant benefit Gall received from being subject to the 1999 Guidelines.\"<sup>[10]</sup> 446 F.3d, at 889. This criticism is flawed in that it ignores the critical relevance of Gall's voluntary withdrawal, a circumstance that distinguished his conduct not only from that of all his codefendants, but from the vast majority of defendants convicted of conspiracy in federal court. The District Court quite reasonably attached great weight to the fact that Gall voluntarily withdrew from the conspiracy after deciding, on his own initiative, to change his life. This lends strong support to the District Court's conclusion that Gall is not going to return to criminal behavior and is not a danger to society. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C). Compared to a case where the offender's rehabilitation occurred after he was charged with a crime, the District Court here had greater justification <span class=\"star-pagination\">*601</span> for believing Gall's turnaround was genuine, as distinct from a transparent attempt to build a mitigation case.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals thought the District Judge \"gave significant weight to an improper factor\" when he compared Gall's sale of ecstasy when he was a 21-year-old adult to the \"impetuous and ill-considered\" actions of persons under the age of 18. 446 F.3d, at 890. The appellate court correctly observed that the studies cited by the District Judge do not explain how Gall's \"specific behavior in the instant case was impetuous or ill-considered.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In that portion of his sentencing memorandum, however, the judge was discussing the \"character of the defendant,\" not the nature of his offense. App. 122. He noted that Gall's criminal history included a ticket for underage drinking when he was 18 years old and possession of marijuana that was contemporaneous with his offense in this case. In summary, the District Judge observed that all of Gall's criminal history \"including the present offense, occurred when he was twenty-one-years old or younger\" and appeared \"to stem from his addictions to drugs and alcohol.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 123. The District Judge appended a long footnote to his discussion of Gall's immaturity. The footnote includes an excerpt from our opinion in <i>Roper v. Simmons,</i> 543 U.S. 551, 569, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005), which quotes a study stating that a lack of maturity and an undeveloped sense of responsibility are qualities that \"'often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions.'\" The District Judge clearly stated the relevance of these studies in the opening and closing sentences of the footnote:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Immaturity at the time of the offense conduct is not an inconsequential consideration. Recent studies on the development of the human brain conclude that human brain development may not become complete until the age of twenty-five.. . . [T]he recent [National Institute of Health] report confirms that there is no bold line demarcating at what age a person reaches full maturity. While age does not excuse behavior, a sentencing court should account for age when inquiring into the conduct of a defendant.\" App. 123, n. 2.</blockquote>\n<p>Given the dramatic contrast between Gall's behavior before he joined the conspiracy and his conduct after withdrawing, it was not unreasonable for the District Judge to view Gall's immaturity at the time of the offense as a mitigating factor, and his later behavior as a sign that he had matured and would not engage in such impetuous and ill-considered conduct in the future. Indeed, his consideration of that factor finds support in our cases. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> 509 U.S. 350, 367, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993) (holding that a jury was free to consider a 19-year-old defendant's youth when determining whether there was a probability that he would continue to commit violent acts in the future and stating that \"`youth is more than a chronological fact. It is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage'\" (quoting <i>Eddings v. Oklahoma,</i> 455 U.S. 104, 115, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982))).</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court of Appeals thought that, even if Gall's rehabilitation was dramatic and permanent, a sentence of probation for participation as a middleman in a conspiracy distributing 10,000 pills of ecstasy \"lies outside the range of choice dictated by the facts of the case.\" 446 F.3d, at 890. If the Guidelines were still mandatory, and assuming the facts did not justify a Guidelines-based downward departure, this would provide a sufficient basis for setting aside Gall's sentence because the Guidelines state that probation alone is not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*602</span> an appropriate sentence for comparable offenses.<sup>[11]</sup> But the Guidelines are not mandatory, and thus the \"range of choice dictated by the facts of the case\" is significantly broadened. Moreover, the Guidelines are only one of the factors to consider when imposing sentence, and \u00a7 3553(a)(3) directs the judge to consider sentences other than imprisonment.</p>\n<p>We also note that the Government did not argue below, and has not argued here, that a sentence of probation could never be imposed for a crime identical to Gall's. Indeed, it acknowledged that probation could be permissible if the record contained different \u0097 but in our view, no more compelling \u0097 mitigating evidence. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-38 (stating that probation could be an appropriate sentence, given the exact same offense, if \"there are compelling family circumstances where individuals will be very badly hurt in the defendant's family if no one is available to take care of them\").</p>\n<p>The District Court quite reasonably attached great weight to Gall's self-motivated rehabilitation, which was undertaken not at the direction of, or under supervision by, any court, but on his own initiative. This also lends strong support to the conclusion that imprisonment was not necessary to deter Gall from engaging in future criminal conduct or to protect the public from his future criminal acts. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals clearly disagreed with the District Judge's conclusion that consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justified a sentence of probation; it believed that the circumstances presented here were insufficient to sustain such a marked deviation from the Guidelines range. But it is not for the Court of Appeals to decide <i>de novo</i> whether the justification for a variance is sufficient or the sentence reasonable. On abuse-of-discretion review, the Court of Appeals should have given due deference to the District Court's reasoned and reasonable decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justified the sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), I wrote separately to state my view that any appellate review of sentences for substantive reasonableness will necessarily result in a sentencing scheme constitutionally indistinguishable from the mandatory Guidelines struck down in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Whether a sentencing scheme uses mandatory Guidelines, a \"proportionality test\" for Guidelines variances, or a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, there will be some sentences upheld only on the basis of additional judge-found facts.</p>\n<p>Although I continue to believe that substantive-reasonableness review is inherently flawed, I give <i>stare decisis</i> effect to the statutory holding of <i>Rita.</i> The highly deferential standard adopted by the Court today will result in far fewer unconstitutional sentences than the proportionality standard employed by the Eighth Circuit. Moreover, as I noted in <i>Rita,</i> the Court has not foreclosed as-applied constitutional challenges to sentences. The door therefore <span class=\"star-pagination\">*603</span> remains open for a defendant to demonstrate that his sentence, whether inside or outside the advisory Guidelines range, would not have been upheld but for the existence of a fact found by the sentencing judge and not by the jury.</p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court's opinion here, as I do in today's companion case of <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 2007 WL 4292040, which follow <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). My disagreements with holdings in those earlier cases are not the stuff of formally perpetual dissent, but I see their objectionable points hexing our judgments today, see <i>id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456 (SOUTER, J., dissenting), and <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 272, 125 S.Ct. 738 (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). After <i>Booker's</i> remedial holding, I continue to think that the best resolution of the tension between substantial consistency throughout the system and the right of jury trial would be a new Act of Congress: reestablishing a statutory system of mandatory sentencing guidelines (though not identical to the original in all points of detail), but providing for jury findings of all facts necessary to set the upper range of sentencing discretion. See <i>Rita, supra,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2463-2464.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Consistent with my dissenting opinion in <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 2007 WL 4292040, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals because the District Court committed statutory error when it departed below the applicable Guidelines range.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The fundamental question in this case is whether, under the remedial decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must give the policy decisions that are embodied in the Sentencing Guidelines at least some significant weight in making a sentencing decision. I would answer that question in the affirmative and would therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In <i>Booker,</i> a bare majority held that the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Sentencing Reform Act), as amended, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551 <i>et seq.,</i> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991 <i>et seq.,</i> violated the Sixth Amendment insofar as it required district judges to follow the United States Sentencing Guidelines, but another bare majority held that this defect could be remedied by excising the two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(b)(1) and 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), that made compliance with the Guidelines mandatory. As a result of these two holdings, the lower federal courts were instructed that the Guidelines must be regarded as \"effectively advisory,\" <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738, and that individual sentencing decisions are subject to appellate review for \"`reasonableness.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 262, 125 S.Ct. 738. The <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion did not explain exactly what it meant by a system of \"advisory\" guidelines or by \"reasonableness\" review, and the opinion is open to different interpretations.</p>\n<p>It is possible to read the opinion to mean that district judges, after giving the Guidelines a polite nod, may then proceed essentially as if the Sentencing Reform Act had never been enacted. This is how two of the dissents interpreted the Court's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*604</span> opinion. Justice STEVENS wrote that sentencing judges had \"regain[ed] the unconstrained discretion Congress eliminated in 1984\" when it enacted the Sentencing Reform Act. <i>Id.,</i> at 297, 125 S.Ct. 738. Justice SCALIA stated that \"logic compels the conclusion that the sentencing judge. . . has full discretion, as full as what he possessed before the Act was passed, to sentence anywhere within the statutory range.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 305, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>While this is a possible understanding of the remedial opinion, a better reading is that sentencing judges must still give the Guidelines' policy decisions some significant weight and that the courts of appeals must still police compliance. In a key passage, the remedial opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing. See 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(4), (5) (Supp.2004). <i>But compare post, at 305 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part) (claiming that the sentencing judge has the same discretion 'he possessed before the Act was passed').</i> The courts of appeals review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness. These features of the remaining system, while not the system Congress enacted, nonetheless <i>continue to move sentencing in Congress' preferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing disparities</i> while maintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize sentences where necessary.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264-265, 125 S.Ct. 738 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>The implication of this passage is that district courts are still required to give some deference to the policy decisions embodied in the Guidelines and that appellate review must monitor compliance. District courts must not only \"consult\" the Guidelines, they must \"take them into account.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. In addition, the passage distances the remedial majority from Justice SCALIA's position that, under an advisory Guidelines scheme, a district judge would have \"discretion to sentence anywhere within the ranges authorized by statute\" so long as the judge \"state[d] that `this court does not believe that the punishment set forth in the Guidelines is appropriate for this sort of offense.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 305, 125 S.Ct. 738 (opinion dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Moreover, in the passage quoted above and at other points in the remedial opinion, the Court expressed confidence that appellate review for reasonableness would help to avoid \"`excessive sentencing disparities'\" and \"would tend to iron out sentencing differences.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 263, 125 S.Ct. 738. Indeed, a major theme of the remedial opinion, as well as our decision last Term in <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), was that the post-<i>Booker</i> sentencing regime would still promote the Sentencing Reform Act's goal of reducing sentencing disparities. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2463, 2463-2464, 2467; <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 259-260, 263-264, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>It is unrealistic to think this goal can be achieved over the long term if sentencing judges need only give lip service to the Guidelines. The other sentencing factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a) are so broad that they impose few real restraints on sentencing judges. See <i>id.,</i> at 305, 125 S.Ct. 738 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part). Thus, if judges are obligated to do no more than consult the Guidelines before deciding upon the sentence that is, in their independent judgment, sufficient to serve the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, federal sentencing will not \"move . . . in Congress' preferred direction.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738 (opinion of the Court). On the contrary, sentencing disparities will gradually increase. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*605</span> Appellate decisions affirming sentences that diverge from the Guidelines (such as the Court's decision today) will be influential, and the sentencing habits developed during the pre-<i>Booker</i> era will fade.</p>\n<p>Finally, in reading the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion, we should not forget the decision's constitutional underpinnings. <i>Booker</i> and its antecedents are based on the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. The Court has held that (at least under a mandatory guidelines system) a defendant has the right to have a jury, not a judge, find facts that increase the defendant's authorized sentence. See <i>id.,</i> at 230-232, 125 S.Ct. 738; <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 303-304, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). It is telling that the rules set out in the Court's opinion in the present case have nothing to do with juries or factfinding and, indeed, that not one of the facts that bears on petitioner's sentence is disputed. What is at issue, instead, is the allocation of the authority to decide issues of substantive sentencing policy, an issue on which the Sixth Amendment says absolutely nothing. The yawning gap between the Sixth Amendment and the Court's opinion should be enough to show that the <i>Blakely-Booker</i> line of cases has gone astray.</p>\n<p>In <i>Blakely,</i> the Court drew a distinction \u0097 between judicial factfinding under a guidelines system and judicial factfinding under a discretionary sentencing system, see 542 U.S., at 309-310, 124 S.Ct. 2531 \u0097 that, in my judgment, cannot be defended as a matter of principle. It would be a coherent principle to hold that any fact that increases a defendant's sentence beyond the minimum required by the jury's verdict of guilt must be found by a jury. Such a holding, however, would clash with accepted sentencing practice at the time of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment. By that time, many States had enacted criminal statutes that gave trial judges the discretion to select a sentence from within a prescribed range,<sup>[1]</sup> and the First Congress enacted federal criminal statutes that were cast in this mold. See An Act for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*606</span> Punishment of certain Crimes against the United States, 1 Stat. 112.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Under a sentencing system of this type, trial judges inevitably make findings of fact (albeit informally) that increase sentences beyond the minimum required by the jury's verdict. For example, under a statute providing that the punishment for burglary is, say, imprisonment for up to <i>x</i> years, the sentencing court might increase the sentence that it would have otherwise imposed by some amount based on evidence introduced at trial that the defendant was armed or that, before committing the crime, the defendant had told a confederate that he would kill the occupants if they awakened during the burglary. The only difference between this sort of factfinding and the type that occurs under a guidelines system is that factfinding under a guidelines system is explicit and the effect of each critical finding is quantified. But in both instances, facts that cause a defendant to spend more time in prison are found by judges, not juries, and therefore no distinction can be drawn as a matter of Sixth Amendment principle.</p>\n<p>The Court's acceptance of this distinction also produced strange collateral consequences. A sentencing system that gives trial judges the discretion to sentence within a specified range not only permits judicial factfinding that may increase a sentence, such a system also gives individual judges discretion to implement their own sentencing policies. This latter feature, whether wise or unwise, has nothing to do with the concerns of the Sixth Amendment, and a principal objective of the Sentencing Reform Act was to take this power out of the hands of individual district judges.</p>\n<p>The <i>Booker</i> remedy, however, undid this congressional choice. In curing the Sentencing Reform Act's perceived defect regarding judicial factfinding, <i>Booker</i> restored to the district courts at least a measure of the policymaking authority that the Sentencing Reform Act had taken away. (How much of this authority was given back is, of course, the issue here.)</p>\n<p>I recognize that the Court is committed to the <i>Blakely-Booker</i> line of cases, but we are not required to continue along a path that will take us further and further off course. Because the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion may be read to require sentencing judges to give weight to the Guidelines, I would adopt that interpretation and thus minimize the gap between what the Sixth Amendment requires and what our cases have held.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Read fairly, the opinion of the Court of Appeals holds that the District Court did not properly exercise its sentencing discretion because it did not give sufficient weight to the policy decisions reflected in the Guidelines. Petitioner was convicted of a serious crime, conspiracy to distribute \"ecstasy.\" He distributed thousands of pills and made between $30,000 and $40,000 in profit. Although he eventually <span class=\"star-pagination\">*607</span> left the conspiracy, he did so because he was worried about apprehension. The Sentencing Guidelines called for a term of imprisonment of 30 to 37 months, but the District Court imposed a term of probation.</p>\n<p>Compelled to interpret the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion, the District Court, it appears, essentially chose the interpretation outlined in Justice STEVENS' and Justice SCALIA's dissents. The District Court considered the sentence called for by the Guidelines, but I see no evidence that the District Court deferred to the Guidelines to any significant degree. Rather, the court determined what it thought was appropriate under the circumstances and sentenced petitioner accordingly.</p>\n<p>If the question before us was whether a reasonable jurist could conclude that a sentence of probation was sufficient in this case to serve the purposes of punishment set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), the District Court's decision could not be disturbed. But because I believe that sentencing judges must still give some significant weight to the Guidelines sentencing range, the Commission's policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, \u00a7 3553(a)(3), (4), and (5) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), I agree with the Eighth Circuit that the District Court did not properly exercise its discretion.</p>\n<p>Appellate review for abuse of discretion is not an empty formality. A decision calling for the exercise of judicial discretion \"hardly means that it is unfettered by meaningful standards or shielded from thorough appellate review.\" <i>Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</i> 422 U.S. 405, 416, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975). Accord, <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 487 U.S. 326, 336, 108 S.Ct. 2413, 101 L.Ed.2d 297 (1988); <i>Franks v. Bowman Transp.

And when a trial court is required by statute to take specified factors into account in making a discretionary decision, the trial court must be reversed if it \"ignored or slighted a factor that Congress has deemed pertinent.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 337, 108 S.Ct. 2413. See <i>Hensley v.

See also <i>United States v.

The opinion of the Court makes much of the restrictions and burdens of probation, see <i>ante,</i> at 595-596, but in the real world there is a huge difference between imprisonment and probation. If the District Court had given any appreciable weight to the Guidelines, the District Court could not have sentenced petitioner to probation without very strong countervailing considerations.</p>\n<p>The court listed five considerations as justification for a sentence of probation: (1) petitioner's \"voluntary and explicit withdrawal from the conspiracy,\" (2) his \"exemplary behavior while on bond,\" (3) \"the support manifested by family and friends,\" (4) \"the lack of criminal history, especially a complete lack of any violent criminal history,\" (5) and his age at the time of the offense, 21. App. 97.</p>\n<p>Two of the considerations that the District Court cited \u0097 \"the support manifested by family and friends\" and his age, <i>ibid.</i> \u0097 amounted to a direct rejection of the Sentencing Commission's authority to decide the most basic issues of sentencing policy. In the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress required the Sentencing Commission to consider and decide whether certain specified factors \u0097 including \"age,\" \"education,\" \"previous employment record,\" \"physical condition,\" \"family ties and responsibilities,\" and \"community ties\" \u0097 \"have any relevance to the nature [and] extent . . . of an appropriate sentence.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(d). These factors come up with great frequency, and judges in the pre-Sentencing Reform Act era disagreed regarding their relevance. Indeed, some of these factors were viewed by some judges as reasons for increasing a sentence and by others as reasons for decreasing a sentence. For example, if a defendant had a job, a supportive family, and friends, those factors were sometimes viewed as justifying a harsher sentence on the ground that the defendant had squandered the opportunity to lead a law-abiding life. Alternatively, those same factors were sometimes viewed as justifications for a more lenient sentence on the ground that a defendant with a job and a network of support would be less likely to return to crime. If each judge is free to implement his or her personal views on such matters, sentencing disparities are inevitable.</p>\n<p>In response to Congress' direction to establish uniform national sentencing policies regarding these common sentencing factors, the Sentencing Commission issued policy statements concluding that \"age,\" \"family ties,\" and \"community ties\" are relevant to sentencing only in unusual cases. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a7 5H1.1 (age), 5H1.6 (family and community ties) (Nov.2006). The District Court in this case did not claim that there was anything particularly unusual about petitioner's family or community ties or his age, but the court cited these factors as justifications for a sentence of probation. Although the District Court was obligated to take into account the Commission's policy statements and the need to avoid sentencing disparities, the District Court rejected Commission policy statements that are critical to the effort to reduce such disparities.</p>\n<p>The District Court relied on petitioner's lack of criminal history, but criminal history (or the lack thereof) is a central factor in the calculation of the Guidelines range. Petitioner was given credit for his lack of criminal history in the calculation of his Guidelines sentence. Consequently, giving petitioner additional credit for this factor was nothing more than an expression of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*609</span> disagreement with the policy determination reflected in the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p>The District Court mentioned petitioner's \"exemplary behavior while on bond,\" App. 97, but this surely cannot be regarded as a weighty factor.</p>\n<p>Finally, the District Court was plainly impressed by petitioner's \"voluntary and explicit withdrawal from the conspiracy.\" <i>Ibid.</i> As the Government argues, the legitimate strength of this factor is diminished by petitioner's motivation in withdrawing. He did not leave the conspiracy for reasons of conscience, and he made no effort to stop the others in the ring. He withdrew because he had become afraid of apprehension. 446 F.3d 884, 886 (C.A.8 2006). While the District Court was within its rights in regarding this factor and petitioner's \"self-rehabilitat[ion],\" App. 75, as positive considerations, they are not enough, in light of the Guidelines' call for a 30- to 37-month prison term, to warrant a sentence of probation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court attacks straw men. The Court unjustifiably faults the Eighth Circuit for using what it characterizes as a \"rigid mathematical formula.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 596. The Eighth Circuit (following a Seventh Circuit opinion) stated that a trial judge's justifications for a sentence outside the Guidelines range must be \"proportional to the extent of the difference between the advisory range and the sentence imposed.\" 446 F.3d, at 889 (quoting <i>United States v. Claiborne,</i> 439 F.3d 479, 481 (C.A.8 2006), in turn quoting <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 427 F.3d 423, 426-427 (C.A.7 2005); internal quotation marks omitted). Taking this language literally as requiring a mathematical computation, the Court has an easy time showing that mathematical precision is not possible:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he mathematical approach assumes the existence of some ascertainable method of assigning percentages to various justifications. Does withdrawal from a conspiracy justify more or less than, say, a 30% reduction? . . . What percentage, if any, should be assigned to evidence that a defendant poses no future threat to society, or to evidence that innocent third parties are dependent on him?\" <i>Ante,</i> at 596.</blockquote>\n<p>This criticism is quite unfair. It is apparent that the Seventh and Eighth Circuits did not mean to suggest that proportionality review could be reduced to a mathematical equation, and certainly the Eighth Circuit in this case did not assign numbers to the various justifications offered by the District Court. All that the Seventh and Eighth Circuits meant, I am convinced, is what this Court's opinion states, <i>i.e.,</i> that \"the extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range\" is a relevant consideration in determining whether the District Court properly exercised its sentencing discretion. <i>Ante,</i> at 592.</p>\n<p>This Court's opinion is also wrong in suggesting that the Eighth Circuit's approach was inconsistent with the abuse-of-discretion standard of appellate review. <i>Ante,</i> at 596. The Eighth Circuit stated unequivocally that it was conducting abuse-of-discretion review, 446 F.3d, at 888-889; abuse-of-discretion review is not toothless; and it is entirely proper for a reviewing court to find an abuse of discretion when important factors \u0097 in this case, the Guidelines, policy statements, and the need to avoid sentencing disparities \u0097 are \"slighted.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 487 U.S., at 337, 108 S.Ct. 2413. The mere fact that the Eighth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*610</span> Circuit reversed is hardly proof that the Eighth Circuit did not apply the correct standard of review.</p>\n<p>Because I believe that the Eighth Circuit correctly interpreted and applied the standards set out in the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion, I must respectfully dissent.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Ecstasy is sometimes called \"MDMA\" because its scientific name is \"methylenedioxy-methamphetamine.\" App. 24, 118.</p>\n<p>[2]  Notably, not all of the Guidelines are tied to this empirical evidence. For example, the Sentencing Commission departed from the empirical approach when setting the Guidelines range for drug offenses, and chose instead to key the Guidelines to the statutory mandatory minimum sentences that Congress established for such crimes. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1A1.1 (Nov.2006) (USSG). This decision, and its effect on a district judge's authority to deviate from the Guidelines range in a particular drug case, is addressed in <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 2007 WL 4292040.</p>\n<p>[3]  Several Courts of Appeals had rejected such a presumption of unreasonableness even prior to our decision in <i>Rita.</i> See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Howard,</i> 454 F.3d 700, 703 (C.A.7 2006) (\"Although a sentence outside the range does not enjoy the presumption of reasonableness that one within the range does, it does not warrant a presumption of unreasonableness\"); <i>United States v. Matheny,</i> 450 F.3d 633, 642 (C.A.6 2006) (\"[T]his court's holding that sentences within the advisory guideline range are presumptively reasonable does not mean that sentences outside of that range are presumptively unreasonable\"); <i>United States v. Myers,</i> 439 F.3d 415, 417 (C.A.8 2006) (\"We have determined that a sentence imposed within the guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. While it does not follow that a sentence outside the guidelines range is unreasonable, we review a district court's decision to depart from the appropriate guidelines range for abuse of discretion\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>[4]  See also Advisory Council of Judges of National Council on Crime and Delinquency, Guides for Sentencing 13-14 (1957) (\"Probation is not granted out of a spirit of leniency.... As the Wickersham Commission said, probation is not merely `letting an offender off easily'\"); 1 N. Cohen, The Law of Probation and Parole \u00a7 7:9 (2d ed. 1999) (\"[T]he probation or parole conditions imposed on an individual can have a significant impact on both that person and society. ... Often these conditions comprehensively regulate significant facets of their day-to-day lives .... They may become subject to frequent searches by government officials, as well as to mandatory counseling sessions with a caseworker or psychotherapist\").</p>\n<p>[5]  Notably, when the Court of Appeals explained its disagreement with the District Judge's decision in this case, it made no attempt to quantify the strength of any of the mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p>[6]  Section 3553(a) lists seven factors that a sentencing court must consider. The first factor is a broad command to consider \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The second factor requires the consideration of the general purposes of sentencing, including:\n</p>\n<p>\"the need for the sentence imposed \u0097</p>\n<p>\"(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</p>\n<p>\"(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</p>\n<p>\"(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</p>\n<p>\"(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\" \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p>The third factor pertains to \"the kinds of sentences available,\" \u00a7 3553(a)(3); the fourth to the Sentencing Guidelines; the fifth to any relevant policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission; the sixth to \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities,\" \u00a7 3553(a)(6); and the seventh to \"the need to provide restitution to any victim,\" \u00a7 3553(a)(7). Preceding this list is a general directive to \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\" of sentencing described in the second factor. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The fact that \u00a7 3553(a) explicitly directs sentencing courts to consider the Guidelines supports the premise that district courts must begin their analysis with the Guidelines and remain cognizant of them throughout the sentencing process.</p>\n<p>[7]  District judges sentence, on average, 117 defendants every year. Administrative Office of United States Courts, 2006 Federal Court Management Statistics 167. The District Judge in this case, Judge Pratt, has sentenced over 990 offenders over the course of his career. <i>United States v. Likens,</i> 464 F.3d 823, 827, n. 1 (C.A.8 2006) (Bright, J., dissenting). Only a relatively small fraction of these defendants appeal their sentence on reasonableness grounds. See <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S., at 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035 (\"In 1994, for example, 93.9% of Guidelines cases were not appealed\"); <i>Likens,</i> 464 F.3d, at 827, n. 1 (Bright, J., dissenting) (noting that the District Judge had sentenced hundreds of defendants and that \"[w]e have reviewed only a miniscule number of those cases\"); cf. United States Sentencing Commission, 2006 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics 135-152.</p>\n<p>[8]  It is particularly revealing that when we adopted an abuse-of-discretion standard in <i>Koon,</i> we explicitly rejected the Government's argument that <i>\"de novo</i> review of departure decisions is necessary `to protect against unwarranted disparities arising from the differing sentencing approaches of individual district judges.'\" 518 U.S., at 97, 116 S.Ct. 2035 (quoting Brief for United States in O.T. 1995, No. 94-1664, p. 12). Even then we were satisfied that a more deferential abuse-of-discretion standard could successfully balance the need to \"reduce unjustified disparities\" across the Nation and \"consider every convicted person as an individual.\" 518 U.S., at 113, 116 S.Ct. 2035.</p>\n<p>[9]  The District Judge also gave specific consideration to the fact \u0097 not directly taken into account by the Guidelines \u0097 that Gall netted $30,000 from his participation in the conspiracy. He noted, however:\n</p>\n<p>\"[T]his fact can be viewed from different perspectives. On the one hand, [Gall] should be punished for profiting from a criminal scheme. ... On the other hand, [Gall], who is from a working-class family and has few financial resources, decided to turn his back on what, for him, was a highly profitable venture.... The Court can not consider, for the purposes of sentencing, one side of the financial aspect of the offense conduct without considering the other.\" App. 123-124, n. 3.</p>\n<p>[10]  The Court of Appeals explained that under the current Guidelines, which treat ecstasy more harshly, Gall's base offense level would have been 32, eight levels higher than the base offense level imposed under the 1999 Guidelines.</p>\n<p>[11]  Specifically, probation is not recommended under the Guidelines when the applicable Guidelines range is outside Zone A of the sentencing table as it is here. USSG \u00a7 5B1.1.</p>\n<p>[1]  To take some examples, Connecticut, as of 1784, punished burglary and robbery without violence with imprisonment of up to 10 years \"at the Discretion of the Superior Court before whom the Conviction is had.\" See Acts and Laws of the State of Connecticut 18 (1784). A 1749 Delaware law punished assault of a parent with imprisonment of up to 18 months. Laws of the State of Delaware 306 (1797). A 1793 Maryland law gave courts the ability to \"in their discretion, adjudge\" criminal defendants \"to serve and labour for any time, in their discretion, not exceeding\" specified terms of years. Digest of the Laws of Maryland 196 (T. Herty 1799). By 1785, Massachusetts allowed judges to sentence criminals convicted of a variety of offenses, including assault and manslaughter, \"according to the aggravation of the offense,\" or \"at the discretion of the Court.\" The Perpetual Laws, of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, from the Establishment of its Constitution to the First Session of the General Court A.D. 1788 (1788), reprinted in The First Laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, pp. 244-252 (J. Cushing comp.1981). In 1791, New Hampshire passed a law punishing certain assaults with imprisonment of up to two years, and forgery with imprisonment of up to three years, at the court's discretion. See Laws of the State of New Hampshire (1792). New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and South Carolina likewise enacted criminal statutes providing for indeterminate sentences of imprisonment at the discretion of the court either before, or in the immediate wake of, the ratification of the Sixth Amendment. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Laws of the State of New Jersey 210-218 (1800) (detailing laws passed in 1796); 2 Laws of the State of New York 45-48, 211, 242-248, 390 (1789); Laws of the State of North Carolina 288, 389 (J. Iredell 1791); An Abridgment of the Laws of Pennsylvania, Penal Laws 1-47 (1801) (detailing laws passed 1790-1794); Public Laws of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations 584-600 (1798); Public Laws of the State of South Carolina 55, 61, 257, 497 (J. Grimke 1790).</p>\n<p>[2]  We have often looked to laws passed by the First Congress to aide interpretation of the Bill of Rights, which that Congress proposed. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Harmelin v. Michigan,</i> 501 U.S. 957, 980, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (noting, while interpreting the Eighth Amendment, that \"[t]he actions of the First Congress . . . are of course persuasive evidence of what the Constitution means\"); <i>Marsh v. Chambers,</i> 463 U.S. 783, 788-790, 103 S.Ct. 3330, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983) (looking to the actions of the First Congress in interpreting the First Amendment); <i>Carroll v.

The Court's opinion in this case conspicuously refrains from directly addressing that question, and the opinion in <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 2007 WL 4292040, is explicitly equivocal, stating that \"while the Guidelines are no longer binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge's view that the Guidelines range `fails properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a) considerations' even in a mine-run case.\" <i>Post,</i> at ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, at 575 (quoting <i>Rita v.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 06\u20137949. Argued October 2, 2007\u2014Decided December 10, 2007\nPetitioner Gall joined an ongoing enterprise distributing the controlled\n  substance \u201cecstasy\u201d while in college, but withdrew from the conspir\n  acy after seven months, has sold no illegal drugs since, and has used\n  no illegal drugs and worked steadily since graduation. Three and\n  half years after withdrawing from the conspiracy, Gall pleaded guilty\n  to his participation. A presentence report recommended a sentence of\n  30 to 37 months in prison, but the District Court sentenced Gall to 36\n  months\u2019 probation, finding that probation reflected the seriousness of\n  his offense and that imprisonment was unnecessary because his vol\n  untary withdrawal from the conspiracy and postoffense conduct\n  showed that he would not return to criminal behavior and was not a\n  danger to society. The Eighth Circuit reversed on the ground that a\n  sentence outside the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range must be\u2014\n  and was not in this case\u2014supported by extraordinary circumstances.\nHeld:\n    1. While the extent of the difference between a particular sentence\n and the recommended Guidelines range is relevant, courts of appeals\n must review all sentences\u2014whether inside, just outside, or signifi\n cantly outside the Guidelines range\u2014under a deferential abuse-of\n discretion standard. Pp. 7\u201314.\n       (a) Because the Guidelines are now advisory, appellate review of\n sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are \u201crea\n sonable,\u201d United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, and an abuse-of\n discretion standard applies to appellate review of sentencing deci\n sions. A district judge must consider the extent of any departure\n from the Guidelines and must explain the appropriateness of an un\n usually lenient or harsh sentence with sufficient justifications. An\n appellate court may take the degree of variance into account and con\n2                       GALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    sider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines, but it may not re\n    quire \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances or employ a rigid mathematical\n    formula using a departure\u2019s percentage as the standard for determin\n    ing the strength of the justification required for a specific sentence.\n    Such approaches come too close to creating an impermissible unrea\n    sonableness presumption for sentences outside the Guidelines range.\n    The mathematical approach also suffers from infirmities of applica\n    tion. And both approaches reflect a practice of applying a heightened\n    standard of review to sentences outside the Guidelines range, which\n    is inconsistent with the rule that the abuse-of-discretion standard\n    applies to appellate review of all sentencing decisions\u2014whether in\n    side or outside that range. Pp. 7\u201310.\n          (b) A district court should begin by correctly calculating the ap\n    plicable Guidelines range. The Guidelines are the starting point and\n    initial benchmark but are not the only consideration. After permit\n    ting both parties to argue for a particular sentence, the judge should\n    consider all of 18 U. S. C. \u00a73353(a)\u2019s factors to determine whether\n    they support either party\u2019s proposal. He may not presume that the\n    Guidelines range is reasonable but must make an individualized as\n    sessment based on the facts presented. If he decides on an outside-\n    the-Guidelines sentence, he must consider the extent of the deviation\n    and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support\n    the degree of variation. He must adequately explain the chosen sen\n    tence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the\n    perception of fair sentencing. In reviewing the sentence, the appel\n    late court must first ensure that the district court made no signifi\n    cant procedural errors and then consider the sentence\u2019s substantive\n    reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, taking into\n    account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of a\n    variance from the Guidelines range, but must give due deference to\n    the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a73553(a) factors justify the vari\n    ance. That the appellate court might have reasonably reached a dif\n    ferent conclusion does not justify reversal. Pp. 11\u201314.\n       2. On abuse-of-discretion review, the Eighth Circuit failed to give\n    due deference to the District Court\u2019s reasoned and reasonable sen\n    tencing decision. Since the District Court committed no procedural\n    error, the only question for the Circuit was whether the sentence was\n    reasonable, i.e., whether the District Judge abused his discretion in\n    determining that the \u00a73553(a) factors supported the sentence and\n    justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range. The Cir\n    cuit gave virtually no deference to the District Court\u2019s decision that\n    the variance was justified. The Circuit clearly disagreed with the\n    District Court\u2019s decision, but it was not for the Circuit to decide de\n    novo whether the justification for a variance is sufficient or the sen\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

The first, Rita v. United\nStates, 551 U. S. ___ (2007), involved a sentence within the\nrange recommended by the Federal Sentencing Guide\nlines; we held that when a district judge\u2019s discretionary\ndecision in a particular case accords with the sentence the\nUnited States Sentencing Commission deems appropriate\n\u201cin the mine run of cases,\u201d the court of appeals may pre\nsume that the sentence is reasonable. Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11).\n   The second case, Claiborne v. United States, involved a\nsentence below the range recommended by the Guidelines,\nand raised the converse question whether a court of ap\npeals may apply a \u201cproportionality test,\u201d and require that\na sentence that constitutes a substantial variance from the\nGuidelines be justified by extraordinary circumstances.\nSee Claiborne v. United States, 549 U. S. ___ (2006). We\ndid not have the opportunity to answer this question\n2                    GALL v.

We granted certiorari in the case before us\ntoday in order to reach that question, left unanswered last\nTerm. 551 U. S. ___ (2007). We now hold that, while the\nextent of the difference between a particular sentence and\nthe recommended Guidelines range is surely relevant,\ncourts of appeals must review all sentences\u2014whether\ninside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines\nrange\u2014under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\nWe also hold that the sentence imposed by the experienced\nDistrict Judge in this case was reasonable.\n                              I\n  In February or March 2000, petitioner Brian Gall, a\nsecond-year college student at the University of Iowa, was\ninvited by Luke Rinderknecht to join an ongoing enter\nprise distributing a controlled substance popularly known\nas \u201cecstasy.\u201d1 Gall\u2014who was then a user of ecstasy, co\ncaine, and marijuana\u2014accepted the invitation. During\nthe ensuing seven months, Gall delivered ecstasy pills,\nwhich he received from Rinderknecht, to other conspira\ntors, who then sold them to consumers. He netted over\n$30,000.\n  A month or two after joining the conspiracy, Gall\nstopped using ecstasy. A few months after that, in Sep\ntember 2000, he advised Rinderknecht and other co\nconspirators that he was withdrawing from the conspir\nacy. He has not sold illegal drugs of any kind since. He\nhas, in the words of the District Court, \u201cself-rehabilitated.\u201d\nApp. 75. He graduated from the University of Iowa in\n2002, and moved first to Arizona, where he obtained a job\nin the construction industry, and later to Colorado, where\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Ecstasy is sometimes called \u201cMDMA\u201d because its scientific name is\n\n\u201cmethylenedioxymethamphetamine.\u201d App. 24, 118.\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhe earned $18 per hour as a master carpenter. He has not\nused any illegal drugs since graduating from college.\n   After Gall moved to Arizona, he was approached by\nfederal law enforcement agents who questioned him about\nhis involvement in the ecstasy distribution conspiracy.\nGall admitted his limited participation in the distribution\nof ecstasy, and the agents took no further action at that\ntime. On April 28, 2004\u2014approximately a year and a half\nafter this initial interview, and three and a half years\nafter Gall withdrew from the conspiracy\u2014an indictment\nwas returned in the Southern District of Iowa charging\nhim and seven other defendants with participating in a\nconspiracy to distribute ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana,\nthat began in or about May 1996 and continued through\nOctober 30, 2002. The Government has never questioned\nthe truthfulness of any of Gall\u2019s earlier statements or\ncontended that he played any role in, or had any knowl\nedge of, other aspects of the conspiracy described in the\nindictment. When he received notice of the indictment,\nGall moved back to Iowa and surrendered to the authori\nties. While free on his own recognizance, Gall started his\nown business in the construction industry, primarily\nengaged in subcontracting for the installation of windows\nand doors. In his first year, his profits were over $2,000\nper month.\n   Gall entered into a plea agreement with the Govern\nment, stipulating that he was \u201cresponsible for, but did not\nnecessarily distribute himself, at least 2,500 grams of\n[ecstasy], or the equivalent of at least 87.5 kilograms of\nmarijuana.\u201d Id., at 25. In the agreement, the Government\nacknowledged that by \u201con or about September of 2000,\u201d\nGall had communicated his intent to stop distributing\necstasy to Rinderknecht and other members of the con\nspiracy.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napplicable to Gall because he had withdrawn from the\nconspiracy prior to the effective date of those changes.\n   In her presentence report, the probation officer con\ncluded that Gall had no significant criminal history; that\nhe was not an organizer, leader, or manager; and that his\noffense did not involve the use of any weapons. The report\nstated that Gall had truthfully provided the Government\nwith all of the evidence he had concerning the alleged\noffenses, but that his evidence was not useful because he\nprovided no new information to the agents. The report\nalso described Gall\u2019s substantial use of drugs prior to his\noffense and the absence of any such use in recent years.\nThe report recommended a sentencing range of 30 to 37\nmonths of imprisonment.\n   The record of the sentencing hearing held on May 27,\n2005, includes a \u201csmall flood\u201d of letters from Gall\u2019s parents\nand other relatives, his fiance, neighbors, and representa\ntives of firms doing business with him, uniformly praising\nhis character and work ethic. The transcript includes the\ntestimony of several witnesses and the District Judge\u2019s\ncolloquy with the Assistant United States Attorney\n(AUSA) and with Gall. The AUSA did not contest any of\nthe evidence concerning Gall\u2019s law-abiding life during the\npreceding five years, but urged that \u201cthe Guidelines are\nappropriate and should be followed,\u201d and requested that\nthe court impose a prison sentence within the Guidelines\nrange. Id., at 93. He mentioned that two of Gall\u2019s co\nconspirators had been sentenced to 30 and 35 months,\nrespectively, but upon further questioning by the District\nCourt, he acknowledged that neither of them had volun\ntarily withdrawn from the conspiracy.\n   The District Judge sentenced Gall to probation for a\nterm of 36 months. In addition to making a lengthy state\nment on the record, the judge filed a detailed sentencing\nmemorandum explaining his decision, and provided the\nfollowing statement of reasons in his written judgment:\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

C. 3553(a), the Defendant\u2019s ex\n    plicit withdrawal from the conspiracy almost four\n    years before the filing of the Indictment, the Defen\n    dant\u2019s post-offense conduct, especially obtaining a col\n    lege degree and the start of his own successful busi\n    ness, the support of family and friends, lack of\n    criminal history, and his age at the time of the offense\n    conduct, all warrant the sentence imposed, which was\n    sufficient, but not greater than necessary to serve the\n    purposes of sentencing.\u201d Id., at 117.\n  At the end of both the sentencing hearing and the sen\ntencing memorandum, the District Judge reminded Gall\nthat probation, rather than \u201can act of leniency,\u201d is a \u201csub\nstantial restriction of freedom.\u201d Id., at 99, 125. In the\nmemorandum, he emphasized:\n       \u201c[Gall] will have to comply with strict reporting\n    conditions along with a three-year regime of alcohol\n    and drug testing. He will not be able to change or\n    make decisions about significant circumstances in his\n    life, such as where to live or work, which are prized\n    liberty interests, without first seeking authorization\n    from his Probation Officer or, perhaps, even the\n    Court. Of course, the Defendant always faces the\n    harsh consequences that await if he violates the con\n    ditions of his probationary term.\u201d Id., at 125.\n  Finally, the District Judge explained why he had con\ncluded that the sentence of probation reflected the seri\nousness of Gall\u2019s offense and that no term of imprisonment\nwas necessary:\n       \u201cAny term of imprisonment in this case would be\n    counter effective by depriving society of the contribu\n    tions of the Defendant who, the Court has found, un\n    derstands the consequences of his criminal conduct\n6                 GALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    and is doing everything in his power to forge a new\n    life. The Defendant\u2019s post-offense conduct indicates\n    neither that he will return to criminal behavior nor\n    that the Defendant is a danger to society. In fact, the\n    Defendant\u2019s post-offense conduct was not motivated\n    by a desire to please the Court or any other govern\n    mental agency, but was the pre-Indictment product of\n    the Defendant\u2019s own desire to lead a better life.\u201d Id.,\n    at 125\u2013126.\n                               II\n   The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for resen\ntencing. Relying on its earlier opinion in United States v.\nClaiborne, 439 F. 3d 479 (CA8 2006), it held that a sen\ntence outside of the Guidelines range must be supported\nby a justification that \u201c \u2018 \u201cis proportional to the extent of\nthe difference between the advisory range and the sen\ntence imposed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 446 F. 3d 884, 889 (CA8 2006) (quoting\nClaiborne, 439 F. 3d, at 481, in turn quoting United States\nv. Johnson, 427 F. 3d 423, 426\u2013427 (CA7 2005)). Charac\nterizing the difference between a sentence of probation\nand the bottom of Gall\u2019s advisory Guidelines range of 30\nmonths as \u201cextraordinary\u201d because it amounted to \u201ca 100%\ndownward variance,\u201d 446 F. 3d, at 889, the Court of Ap\npeals held that such a variance must be\u2014and here was\nnot\u2014supported by extraordinary circumstances.\n   Rather than making an attempt to quantify the value of\nthe justifications provided by the District Judge, the Court\nof Appeals identified what it regarded as five separate\nerrors in the District Judge\u2019s reasoning: (1) He gave \u201ctoo\nmuch weight to Gall\u2019s withdrawal from the conspiracy\u201d; (2)\ngiven that Gall was 21 at the time of his offense, the Dis\ntrict Judge erroneously gave \u201csignificant weight\u201d to stud\nies showing impetuous behavior by persons under the age\nof 18; (3) he did not \u201cproperly weigh\u201d the seriousness of\nGall\u2019s offense; (4) he failed to consider whether a sentence\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

As we shall ex\nplain, we are not persuaded that these factors, whether\nviewed separately or in the aggregate, are sufficient to\nsupport the conclusion that the District Judge abused his\ndiscretion. As a preface to our discussion of these particu\nlars, however, we shall explain why the Court of Appeals\u2019\nrule requiring \u201cproportional\u201d justifications for departures\nfrom the Guidelines range is not consistent with our re\nmedial opinion in United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220\n(2005).\n                              III\n  In Booker we invalidated both the statutory provision,\n18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which made\nthe Sentencing Guidelines mandatory, and \u00a73742(e) (2000\ned. and Supp. IV), which directed appellate courts to apply\na de novo standard of review to departures from the\nGuidelines. As a result of our decision, the Guidelines are\nnow advisory, and appellate review of sentencing decisions\nis limited to determining whether they are \u201creasonable.\u201d\nOur explanation of \u201creasonableness\u201d review in the Booker\nopinion made it pellucidly clear that the familiar abuse-of\ndiscretion standard of review now applies to appellate\nreview of sentencing decisions. See 543 U. S., at 260\u2013262;\nsee also Rita, 551 U. S., at ___ (STEVENS, J., concurring).\n  It is also clear that a district judge must give serious\nconsideration to the extent of any departure from the\nGuidelines and must explain his conclusion that an un\nusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence is appro\npriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications.\nFor even though the Guidelines are advisory rather than\nmandatory, they are, as we pointed out in Rita, the prod\nuct of careful study based on extensive empirical evidence\nderived from the review of thousands of individual sen\n8                      GALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntencing decisions.2 Id., at ___.\n  In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside\nthe Guidelines range, appellate courts may therefore take\nthe degree of variance into account and consider the ex\ntent of a deviation from the Guidelines. We reject, how\never, an appellate rule that requires \u201cextraordinary\u201d cir\ncumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines\nrange. We also reject the use of a rigid mathematical\nformula that uses the percentage of a departure as the\nstandard for determining the strength of the justifications\nrequired for a specific sentence.\n  As an initial matter, the approaches we reject come too\nclose to creating an impermissible presumption of unrea\nsonableness for sentences outside the Guidelines range.\nSee id., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (\u201cThe fact that we permit\ncourts of appeals to adopt a presumption of reasonableness\ndoes not mean that courts may adopt a presumption of\nunreasonableness\u201d).3 Even the Government has acknowl\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Notably,\n             not all of the Guidelines are tied to this empirical evidence.\nFor example, the Sentencing Commission departed from the empirical\napproach when setting the Guidelines range for drug offenses, and\nchose instead to key the Guidelines to the statutory mandatory mini\nmum sentences that Congress established for such crimes. See United\nStates Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a71A1.1 (Nov. 2006)\n(USSG). This decision, and its effect on a district judge\u2019s authority to\ndeviate from the Guidelines range in a particular drug case, is ad\ndressed in Kimbrough v. United States, post, p. ___.\n   3 Several Courts of Appeals had rejected such a presumption of un\n\nreasonableness even prior to our decision in Rita. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Howard, 454 F. 3d 700, 703 (CA7 2006) (\u201cAlthough a sentence\noutside the range does not enjoy the presumption of reasonableness\nthat one within the range does, it does not warrant a presumption of\nunreasonableness\u201d); United States v. Matheny, 450 F. 3d 633, 642 (CA6\n2006) (\u201c[T]his court\u2019s holding that sentences within the advisory guide\nline range are presumptively reasonable does not mean that sentences\noutside of that range are presumptively unreasonable\u201d); United States\nv. Myers, 439 F. 3d 415, 417 (CA8 2006) (\u201cWe have determined that a\nsentence imposed within the guidelines range is presumptively reason\nable. While it does not follow that a sentence outside the guidelines\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nedged that such a presumption would not be consistent\nwith Booker. See Brief for United States in Rita v. United\nStates, O. T. 2006, No. 06\u20135754, pp. 34\u201335.\n  The mathematical approach also suffers from infirmities\nof application. On one side of the equation, deviations\nfrom the Guidelines range will always appear more ex\ntreme\u2014in percentage terms\u2014when the range itself is low,\nand a sentence of probation will always be a 100% depar\nture regardless of whether the Guidelines range is 1\nmonth or 100 years. Moreover, quantifying the variance\nas a certain percentage of the maximum, minimum, or\nmedian prison sentence recommended by the Guidelines\ngives no weight to the \u201csubstantial restriction of freedom\u201d\ninvolved in a term of supervised release or probation.\nApp. 95.\n  We recognize that custodial sentences are qualitatively\nmore severe than probationary sentences of equivalent\nterms. Offenders on probation are nonetheless subject to\nseveral standard conditions that substantially restrict\ntheir liberty. See United States v. Knights, 534 U. S. 112,\n119 (2001) (\u201cInherent in the very nature of probation is\nthat probationers \u2018do not enjoy the absolute liberty to\nwhich every citizen is entitled\u2019 \u201d (quoting Griffin v. Wiscon\nsin, 483 U.

USSG \u00a75B1.3. Most probationers are also subject\nto individual \u201cspecial conditions\u201d imposed by the court.\nGall, for instance, may not patronize any establishment that\nderives more than 50% of its revenue from the sale of alco\nhol, and must submit to random drug tests as directed by\nhis probation officer. App. 109.\n  On the other side of the equation, the mathematical\napproach assumes the existence of some ascertainable\nmethod of assigning percentages to various justifications.\nDoes withdrawal from a conspiracy justify more or less\nthan, say, a 30% reduction? Does it matter that the with\ndrawal occurred several years ago? Is it relevant that the\nwithdrawal was motivated by a decision to discontinue the\nuse of drugs and to lead a better life? What percentage, if\nany, should be assigned to evidence that a defendant poses\nno future threat to society, or to evidence that innocent\nthird parties are dependent on him? The formula is a\nclassic example of attempting to measure an inventory of\napples by counting oranges.5\n  Most importantly, both the exceptional circumstances\nrequirement and the rigid mathematical formulation\nreflect a practice\u2014common among courts that have\nadopted \u201cproportional review\u201d\u2014of applying a heightened\nstandard of review to sentences outside the Guidelines\nrange. This is inconsistent with the rule that the abuse\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncaseworker or psychotherapist\u201d).\n   5 Notably, when the Court of Appeals explained its disagreement with\n\nthe District Judge\u2019s decision in this case, it made no attempt to quan\ntify the strength of any of the mitigating circumstances.\n                      Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof-discretion standard of review applies to appellate re\nview of all sentencing decisions\u2014whether inside or outside\nthe Guidelines range.\n   As we explained in Rita, a district court should begin all\nsentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the appli\ncable Guidelines range. See 551 U. S., at ___. As a matter\nof administration and to secure nationwide consistency,\nthe Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial\nbenchmark. The Guidelines are not the only considera\ntion, however. Accordingly, after giving both parties an\nopportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem\nappropriate, the district judge should then consider all of\nthe \u00a73553(a) factors to determine whether they support\nthe sentence requested by a party.6 In so doing, he may\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Section   3553(a) lists seven factors that a sentencing court must\nconsider. The first factor is a broad command to consider \u201cthe nature\nand circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of\nthe defendant.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(1). The second factor requires the\nconsideration of the general purposes of sentencing, including:\n\u201cthe need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n\u201c(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the\nlaw, and to provide just punishment for the offense;\n\u201c(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;\n\u201c(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and\n\u201c(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational\ntraining, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most\neffective manner.\u201d \u00a73553(a)(2).\n   The third factor pertains to \u201cthe kinds of sentences available,\u201d\n\u00a73553(a)(3); the fourth to the Sentencing Guidelines; the fifth to any\nrelevant policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission; the\nsixth to \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities,\u201d\n\u00a73553(a)(6); and the seventh to \u201cthe need to provide restitution to any\nvictim,\u201d \u00a73553(a)(7). Preceding this list is a general directive to \u201cimpose\na sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with\nthe purposes\u201d of sentencing described in the second factor. \u00a73553(a)\n(2000 ed., Supp. V). The fact that \u00a73553(a) explicitly directs sentencing\ncourts to consider the Guidelines supports the premise that district\ncourts must begin their analysis with the Guidelines and remain\ncognizant of them throughout the sentencing process.\n12                GALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable. See\nid., at ___. He must make an individualized assessment\nbased on the facts presented. If he decides that an out\nside-Guidelines sentence is warranted, he must consider\nthe extent of the deviation and ensure that the justifica\ntion is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the\nvariance. We find it uncontroversial that a major depar\nture should be supported by a more significant justifica\ntion than a minor one. After settling on the appropriate\nsentence, he must adequately explain the chosen sentence\nto allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote\nthe perception of fair sentencing. Id., at ___.\n   Regardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or\noutside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must\nreview the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion stan\ndard. It must first ensure that the district court commit\nted no significant procedural error, such as failing to\ncalculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range,\ntreating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider\nthe \u00a73553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly\nerroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen\nsentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from\nthe Guidelines range. Assuming that the district court\u2019s\nsentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate\ncourt should then consider the substantive reasonableness\nof the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion\nstandard. When conducting this review, the court will, of\ncourse, take into account the totality of the circumstances,\nincluding the extent of any variance from the Guidelines\nrange. If the sentence is within the Guidelines range, the\nappellate court may, but is not required to, apply a pre\nsumption of reasonableness. Id., at ___. But if the sen\ntence is outside the Guidelines range, the court may not\napply a presumption of unreasonableness. It may consider\nthe extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to\nthe district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a73553(a) factors, on a\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

The fact that the\nappellate court might reasonably have concluded that a\ndifferent sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify\nreversal of the district court.\n   Practical considerations also underlie this legal princi\nple. \u201cThe sentencing judge is in a superior position to\nfind facts and judge their import under \u00a73553(a) in the\nindividual case. The judge sees and hears the evidence,\nmakes credibility determinations, has full knowledge of\nthe facts and gains insights not conveyed by the record.\u201d\nBrief for Federal Public and Community Defenders et al.\nas Amici Curiae 16. \u201cThe sentencing judge has access to,\nand greater familiarity with, the individual case and the\nindividual defendant before him than the Commission or\nthe appeals court.\u201d Rita, 551 U.

As we shall now explain, the opinion of the\nCourt of Appeals in this case does not reflect the requisite\ndeference and does not support the conclusion that the\nDistrict Court abused its discretion.\n                             IV\n  As an initial matter, we note that the District Judge\ncommitted no significant procedural error. He correctly\ncalculated the applicable Guidelines range, allowed both\nparties to present arguments as to what they believed the\nappropriate sentence should be, considered all of the\n\u00a73553(a) factors, and thoroughly documented his reason\ning. The Court of Appeals found that the District Judge\nerred in failing to give proper weight to the seriousness of\nthe offense, as required by \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), and failing to\nconsider whether a sentence of probation would create\nunwarranted disparities, as required by \u00a73553(a)(6). We\ndisagree.\n  Section 3553(a)(2)(A) requires judges to consider \u201cthe\nneed for the sentence imposed . . . to reflect the seriousness\nof the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to pro\nvide just punishment for the offense.\u201d The Court of Ap\npeals concluded that \u201cthe district court did not properly\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 It is particularly revealing that when we adopted an abuse-of\n\ndiscretion standard in Koon, we explicitly rejected the Government\u2019s\nargument that \u201cde novo review of departure decisions is necessary \u2018to\nprotect against unwarranted disparities arising from the differing\nsentencing approaches of individual district judges.\u2019 \u201d 518 U.

Had the prosecutor raised the\nissue, specific discussion of the point might have been in\norder, but it was not incumbent on the District Judge to\nraise every conceivably relevant issue on his own initiative.\n   The Government\u2019s legitimate concern that a lenient\nsentence for a serious offense threatens to promote disre\nspect for the law is at least to some extent offset by the\nfact that seven of the eight defendants in this case have\nbeen sentenced to significant prison terms. Moreover, the\nunique facts of Gall\u2019s situation provide support for the\nDistrict Judge\u2019s conclusion that, in Gall\u2019s case, \u201ca sentence\nof imprisonment may work to promote not respect, but\nderision, of the law if the law is viewed as merely a means\nto dispense harsh punishment without taking into account\nthe real conduct and circumstances involved in sentenc\ning.\u201d Id., at 126.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 The District Judge also gave specific consideration to the fact\u2014not\n\ndirectly taken into account by the Guidelines\u2014that Gall netted $30,000\nfrom his participation in the conspiracy. He noted, however:\n\u201c[T]his fact can be viewed from different perspectives. On the one hand,\n[Gall] should be punished for profiting from a criminal scheme. . . . On\nthe other hand, [Gall], who is from a working-class family and has few\nfinancial resources, decided to turn his back on what, for him, was a\nhighly profitable venture. . . . The Court can not consider, for the pur\nposes of sentencing, one side of the financial aspect of the offense con\nduct without considering the other.\u201d App. 123\u2013124, n. 3.\n16                GALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Section 3553(a)(6) requires judges to consider \u201cthe need\nto avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defen\ndants with similar records who have been found guilty of\nsimilar conduct.\u201d The Court of Appeals stated that \u201cthe\nrecord does not show that the district court considered\nwhether a sentence of probation would result in unwar\nranted disparities.\u201d 446 F. 3d, at 890. As with the seri\nousness of the offense conduct, avoidance of unwarranted\ndisparities was clearly considered by the Sentencing Com\nmission when setting the Guidelines ranges. Since the\nDistrict Judge correctly calculated and carefully reviewed\nthe Guidelines range, he necessarily gave significant\nweight and consideration to the need to avoid unwar\nranted disparities.\n  Moreover, as we understand the colloquy between the\nDistrict Judge and the AUSA, it seems that the judge gave\nspecific attention to the issue of disparity when he in\nquired about the sentences already imposed by a different\njudge on two of Gall\u2019s codefendants. The AUSA advised\nthe District Judge that defendant Harbison had received a\n30-month sentence and that Gooding had received 35\nmonths. The following colloquy then occurred:\n       \u201cTHE COURT: . . . You probably know more about\n     this than anybody. How long did those two stay in the\n     conspiracy, and did they voluntarily withdraw?\n       \u201cMR GRIESS: They did not.\n       \u201cTHE COURT: They did not?\n       \u201cMR. GRIESS: They did not voluntarily withdraw.\n     And they were in the conspiracy, I think, for a shorter\n     period of time, but at the very end.\n       \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Thank you.\n       \u201cMR. GRIESS: A significant difference there, Your\n     Honor, is that they were in the conspiracy after the\n     guidelines changed and, therefore, were sentenced at\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    a much higher level because of that.\u201d App. 88.\n   A little later Mr. Griess stated: \u201cThe last thing I want to\ntalk about goes to sentencing disparity. . . . Obviously, the\nCourt is cognizant of that and wants to avoid any unwar\nranted sentencing disparities.\u201d Id., at 89. He then dis\ncussed at some length the sentence of 36 months imposed\non another codefendant, Jarod Yoder, whose participation\nin the conspiracy was roughly comparable to Gall\u2019s. Griess\nvoluntarily acknowledged three differences between Yoder\nand Gall: Yoder was in the conspiracy at its end and there\nfore was sentenced under the more severe Guidelines, he\nhad a more serious criminal history, and he did not with\ndraw from the conspiracy.\n   From these facts, it is perfectly clear that the District\nJudge considered the need to avoid unwarranted dispari\nties, but also considered the need to avoid unwarranted\nsimilarities among other co-conspirators who were not\nsimilarly situated. The District Judge regarded Gall\u2019s\nvoluntary withdrawal as a reasonable basis for giving him\na less severe sentence than the three codefendants dis\ncussed with the AUSA, who neither withdrew from the\nconspiracy nor rehabilitated themselves as Gall had done.\nWe also note that neither the Court of Appeals nor the\nGovernment has called our attention to a comparable\ndefendant who received a more severe sentence.\n   Since the District Court committed no procedural error,\nthe only question for the Court of Appeals was whether\nthe sentence was reasonable\u2014i.e., whether the District\nJudge abused his discretion in determining that the\n\u00a73553(a) factors supported a sentence of probation and\njustified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines\nrange. As we shall now explain, the sentence was reason\nable. The Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to the contrary was\nincorrect and failed to demonstrate the requisite deference\nto the District Judge\u2019s decision.\n18                   GALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               V\n\n   The Court of Appeals gave virtually no deference to the\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision that the \u00a73553(a) factors justified\na significant variance in this case. Although the Court of\nAppeals correctly stated that the appropriate standard of\nreview was abuse of discretion, it engaged in an analysis\nthat more closely resembled de novo review of the facts\npresented and determined that, in its view, the degree of\nvariance was not warranted.\n   The Court of Appeals thought that the District Court\n\u201cgave too much weight to Gall\u2019s withdrawal from the\nconspiracy because the court failed to acknowledge the\nsignificant benefit Gall received from being subject to the\n1999 Guidelines.\u201d10 446 F. 3d, at 889. This criticism is\nflawed in that it ignores the critical relevance of Gall\u2019s\nvoluntary withdrawal, a circumstance that distinguished\nhis conduct not only from that of all his codefendants, but\nfrom the vast majority of defendants convicted of conspir\nacy in federal court. The District Court quite reasonably\nattached great weight to the fact that Gall voluntarily\nwithdrew from the conspiracy after deciding, on his own\ninitiative, to change his life. This lends strong support to\nthe District Court\u2019s conclusion that Gall is not going to\nreturn to criminal behavior and is not a danger to society.\nSee 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B), (C). Compared to a case\nwhere the offender\u2019s rehabilitation occurred after he was\ncharged with a crime, the District Court here had greater\njustification for believing Gall\u2019s turnaround was genuine,\nas distinct from a transparent attempt to build a mitiga\ntion case.\n   The Court of Appeals thought the District Judge \u201cgave\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 TheCourt of Appeals explained that under the current Guidelines,\nwhich treat ecstasy more harshly, Gall\u2019s base offense level would have\nbeen 32, eight levels higher than the base offense level imposed under\nthe 1999 Guidelines.\n                  Cite as: 552 U.

The appel\nlate court correctly observed that the studies cited by the\nDistrict Judge do not explain how Gall\u2019s \u201cspecific behavior\nin the instant case was impetuous or ill-considered.\u201d Ibid.\n   In that portion of his sentencing memorandum, however,\nthe judge was discussing the \u201ccharacter of the defendant,\u201d\nnot the nature of his offense. App. 122. He noted that\nGall\u2019s criminal history included a ticket for underage\ndrinking when he was 18 years old and possession of mari\njuana that was contemporaneous with his offense in this\ncase. In summary, the District Judge observed that all of\nGall\u2019s criminal history \u201cincluding the present offense,\noccurred when he was twenty-one-years old or younger\u201d\nand appeared \u201cto stem from his addictions to drugs and\nalcohol.\u201d Id., at 123. The District Judge appended a long\nfootnote to his discussion of Gall\u2019s immaturity. The foot\nnote includes an excerpt from our opinion in Roper v.\nSimmons, 543 U. S. 551, 569 (2005), which quotes a study\nstating that a lack of maturity and an undeveloped sense of\nresponsibility are qualities that \u201c \u2018often result in impetuous\nand ill-considered actions.\u2019 \u201d The District Judge clearly\nstated the relevance of these studies in the opening and\nclosing sentences of the footnote:\n      \u201cImmaturity at the time of the offense conduct is\n    not an inconsequential consideration. Recent studies\n    on the development of the human brain conclude that\n    human brain development may not become complete\n    until the age of twenty-five. . . . [T]he recent [National\n    Institute of Health] report confirms that there is no\n    bold line demarcating at what age a person reaches\n    full maturity. While age does not excuse behavior, a\n    sentencing court should account for age when inquir\n20                   GALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n     ing into the conduct of a defendant.\u201d App. 123, n. 2.\n  Given the dramatic contrast between Gall\u2019s behavior\nbefore he joined the conspiracy and his conduct after\nwithdrawing, it was not unreasonable for the District\nJudge to view Gall\u2019s immaturity at the time of the offense\nas a mitigating factor, and his later behavior as a sign\nthat he had matured and would not engage in such im\npetuous and ill-considered conduct in the future. Indeed,\nhis consideration of that factor finds support in our cases.\nSee, e.g., Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 367 (1993)\n(holding that a jury was free to consider a 19-year-old\ndefendant\u2019s youth when determining whether there was a\nprobability that he would continue to commit violent acts\nin the future and stating that \u201c \u2018youth is more than a\nchronological fact. It is a time and condition of life when a\nperson may be most susceptible to influence and to psycho\nlogical damage\u2019 \u201d (quoting Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S.\n104, 115 (1982))).\n  Finally, the Court of Appeals thought that, even if Gall\u2019s\nrehabilitation was dramatic and permanent, a sentence of\nprobation for participation as a middleman in a conspiracy\ndistributing 10,000 pills of ecstasy \u201clies outside the range\nof choice dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d 446 F. 3d, at\n890. If the Guidelines were still mandatory, and assuming\nthe facts did not justify a Guidelines-based downward\ndeparture, this would provide a sufficient basis for setting\naside Gall\u2019s sentence because the Guidelines state that\nprobation alone is not an appropriate sentence for compa\nrable offenses.11 But the Guidelines are not mandatory,\nand thus the \u201crange of choice dictated by the facts of the\ncase\u201d is significantly broadened. Moreover, the Guidelines\nare only one of the factors to consider when imposing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Specifically, probation is not recommended under the Guidelines\n\nwhen the applicable Guidelines range is outside Zone A of the sentenc\ning table as it is here.

Tr. of Oral Arg.\n37\u201338 (stating that probation could be an appropriate\nsentence, given the exact same offense, if \u201cthere are com\npelling family circumstances where individuals will be\nvery badly hurt in the defendant\u2019s family if no one is\navailable to take care of them\u201d).\n   The District Court quite reasonably attached great\nweight to Gall\u2019s self-motivated rehabilitation, which was\nundertaken not at the direction of, or under supervision\nby, any court, but on his own initiative. This also lends\nstrong support to the conclusion that imprisonment was\nnot necessary to deter Gall from engaging in future crimi\nnal conduct or to protect the public from his future crimi\nnal acts. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B), (C).\n   The Court of Appeals clearly disagreed with the District\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that consideration of the \u00a73553(a) fac\ntors justified a sentence of probation; it believed that the\ncircumstances presented here were insufficient to sustain\nsuch a marked deviation from the Guidelines range. But it\nis not for the Court of Appeals to decide de novo whether\nthe justification for a variance is sufficient or the sentence\nreasonable. On abuse-of-discretion review, the Court of\nAppeals should have given due deference to the District\nCourt\u2019s reasoned and reasonable decision that the \u00a73553(a)\nfactors, on the whole, justified the sentence.

United States, 551 U.

Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005).\nWhether a sentencing scheme uses mandatory Guidelines,\na \u201cproportionality test\u201d for Guidelines variances, or a\ndeferential abuse-of-discretion standard, there will be\nsome sentences upheld only on the basis of additional\njudge-found facts.\n  Although I continue to believe that substantive-\nreasonableness review is inherently flawed, I give stare\ndecisis effect to the statutory holding of Rita. The highly\ndeferential standard adopted by the Court today will\nresult in far fewer unconstitutional sentences than the\nproportionality standard employed by the Eighth Circuit.\nMoreover, as I noted in Rita, the Court has not foreclosed\nas-applied constitutional challenges to sentences. The\ndoor therefore remains open for a defendant to demon\nstrate that his sentence, whether inside or outside the\nadvisory Guidelines range, would not have been upheld\nbut for the existence of a fact found by the sentencing\njudge and not by the jury.\n                  Cite as: 552 U.

Booker, 543 U. S.\n220 (2005), a district court must give the policy decisions\nthat are embodied in the Sentencing Guidelines at least\nsome significant weight in making a sentencing decision.\nI would answer that question in the affirmative and would\ntherefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n                               I\n   In Booker, a bare majority held that the Sentencing\nReform Act of 1984 (Sentencing Reform Act), as amended,\n18 U. S. C. \u00a73551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. \u00a7991 et seq., violated\nthe Sixth Amendment insofar as it required district judges\nto follow the United States Sentencing Guidelines, but\nanother bare majority held that this defect could be reme\ndied by excising the two statutory provisions, 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a73553(b)(1) and 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), that\nmade compliance with the Guidelines mandatory. As a\nresult of these two holdings, the lower federal courts were\ninstructed that the Guidelines must be regarded as \u201ceffec\ntively advisory,\u201d Booker, 543 U. S., at 245, and that indi\nvidual sentencing decisions are subject to appellate review\nfor \u201c \u2018reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 262. The Booker remedial\nopinion did not explain exactly what it meant by a system\n2                   GALL v.

This is how two of the dissents inter\npreted the Court\u2019s opinion. JUSTICE STEVENS wrote that\nsentencing judges had \u201cregain[ed] the unconstrained\ndiscretion Congress eliminated in 1984\u201d when it enacted\nthe Sentencing Reform Act. Id., at 297. JUSTICE SCALIA\nstated that \u201clogic compels the conclusion that the sentenc\ning judge . . . has full discretion, as full as what he pos\nsessed before the Act was passed, to sentence anywhere\nwithin the statutory range.\u201d Id., at 305.\n   While this is a possible understanding of the remedial\nopinion, a better reading is that sentencing judges must\nstill give the Guidelines\u2019 policy decisions some significant\nweight and that the courts of appeals must still police\ncompliance. In a key passage, the remedial opinion stated:\n      \u201cThe district courts, while not bound to apply the\n      Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take\n      them into account when sentencing.             See 18\n      U. S. C. A. \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(4), (5) (Supp. 2004). But com\n      pare post, at 305 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part)\n      (claiming that the sentencing judge has the same dis\n      cretion \u2018he possessed before the Act was passed\u2019).

District courts must not only\n\u201cconsult\u201d the Guidelines, they must \u201ctake them into ac\ncount.\u201d Id., at 264. In addition, the passage distances the\nremedial majority from JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s position that,\nunder an advisory Guidelines scheme, a district judge\nwould have \u201cdiscretion to sentence anywhere within the\nranges authorized by statute\u201d so long as the judge\n\u201cstate[d] that \u2018this court does not believe that the punish\nment set forth in the Guidelines is appropriate for this\nsort of offense.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 305 (opinion dissenting in part).\n   Moreover, in the passage quoted above and at other\npoints in the remedial opinion, the Court expressed confi\ndence that appellate review for reasonableness would help\nto avoid \u201c \u2018excessive sentencing disparities\u2019 \u201d and \u201cwould\ntend to iron out sentencing differences.\u201d Id., at 263.\nIndeed, a major theme of the remedial opinion, as well as\nour decision last Term in Rita v. United States, 551 U. S.\n___ (2007), was that the post-Booker sentencing regime\nwould still promote the Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s goal of\nreducing sentencing disparities. See, e.g., 551 U. S., at __\n(slip op., at 8), __ (slip op., at 9), __ (slip op., at 15); Booker,\nsupra, at 259\u2013260, 263\u2013264.\n   It is unrealistic to think this goal can be achieved over\nthe long term if sentencing judges need only give lip ser\nvice to the Guidelines. The other sentencing factors set\nout in \u00a73553(a) are so broad that they impose few real\nrestraints on sentencing judges. See id., at 305 (SCALIA,\nJ., dissenting in part). Thus, if judges are obligated to do\nno more than consult the Guidelines before deciding upon\nthe sentence that is, in their independent judgment, suffi\ncient to serve the other \u00a73553(a) factors, federal sentenc\ning will not \u201cmove . . . in Congress\u2019 preferred direction.\u201d\nId., at 264 (opinion of the Court). On the contrary, sen\ntencing disparities will gradually increase. Appellate\n4                 GALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ndecisions affirming sentences that diverge from the Guide\nlines (such as the Court\u2019s decision today) will be influen\ntial, and the sentencing habits developed during the pre-\nBooker era will fade.\n   Finally, in reading the Booker remedial opinion, we\nshould not forget the decision\u2019s constitutional underpin\nnings. Booker and its antecedents are based on the Sixth\nAmendment right to trial by jury. The Court has held that\n(at least under a mandatory guidelines system) a defen\ndant has the right to have a jury, not a judge, find facts\nthat increase the defendant\u2019s authorized sentence. See id.,\nat 230\u2013232; Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 303\u2013304\n(2004). It is telling that the rules set out in the Court\u2019s\nopinion in the present case have nothing to do with juries\nor factfinding and, indeed, that not one of the facts that\nbears on petitioner\u2019s sentence is disputed. What is at\nissue, instead, is the allocation of the authority to decide\nissues of substantive sentencing policy, an issue on which\nthe Sixth Amendment says absolutely nothing. The yawn\ning gap between the Sixth Amendment and the Court\u2019s\nopinion should be enough to show that the Blakely-Booker\nline of cases has gone astray.\n   In Blakely, the Court drew a distinction\u2014between judi\ncial factfinding under a guidelines system and judicial\nfactfinding under a discretionary sentencing system, see\n542 U. S., at 309\u2013310\u2014that, in my judgment, cannot be\ndefended as a matter of principle. It would be a coherent\nprinciple to hold that any fact that increases a defendant\u2019s\nsentence beyond the minimum required by the jury\u2019s\nverdict of guilt must be found by a jury. Such a holding,\nhowever, would clash with accepted sentencing practice at\nthe time of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment. By that\ntime, many States had enacted criminal statutes that gave\ntrial judges the discretion to select a sentence from within\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                     5\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\na prescribed range,1 and the First Congress enacted fed\neral criminal statutes that were cast in this mold. See An\nAct for the Punishment of certain Crimes against the\nUnited States, 1 Stat. 112.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 To take some examples, Connecticut, as of 1784, punished burglary\nand robbery without violence with imprisonment of up to 10 years \u201cat\nthe Discretion of the Superior Court before whom the Conviction is\nhad.\u201d See Acts and Laws of the State of Connecticut 18 (1784). A 1749\nDelaware law punished assault of a parent with imprisonment of up to\n18 months. Laws of the State of Delaware 306 (1797). A 1793 Mary\nland law gave courts the ability to \u201cin their discretion, adjudge\u201d crimi\nnal defendants \u201cto serve and labour for any time, in their discretion, not\nexceeding\u201d specified terms of years. Digest of the Laws of Maryland\n196 (T. Herty 1799). By 1785, Massachusetts allowed judges to sen\ntence criminals convicted of a variety of offenses, including assault and\nmanslaughter, \u201caccording to the aggravation of the offense,\u201d or \u201cat the\ndiscretion of the Court.\u201d The Perpetual Laws, of the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts, from the Establishment of its Constitution to the First\nSession of the General Court A. D. 1788 (1788), reprinted in The First\nLaws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, pp. 244\u2013252 (J. Cushing\ncomp. 1981). In 1791, New Hampshire passed a law punishing certain\nassaults with imprisonment of up to two years, and forgery with\nimprisonment of up to three years, at the court\u2019s discretion. See Laws\nof the State of New Hampshire (1792). New Jersey, New York, North\nCarolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and South Carolina likewise\nenacted criminal statutes providing for indeterminate sentences of\nimprisonment at the discretion of the court either before, or in the\nimmediate wake of, the ratification of the Sixth Amendment. See, e.g.,\nLaws of the State of New Jersey 210\u2013218 (1800) (detailing laws passed\nin 1796); 2 Laws of the State of New York 45\u201348, 211, 242\u2013248, 390\n(1789); Laws of the State of North Carolina 288, 389 (J.

Grimke 1790).\n   2 We have often looked to laws passed by the First Congress to aide\n\ninterpretation of the Bill of Rights, which that Congress proposed. See,\ne.g., Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 980 (1991) (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.) (noting, while interpreting the Eighth Amendment, that\n\u201c[t]he actions of the First Congress . . . are of course persuasive evi\ndence of what the Constitution means\u201d); Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S.\n783, 788\u2013790 (1983) (looking to the actions of the First Congress in\n6                    GALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Under a sentencing system of this type, trial judges\ninevitably make findings of fact (albeit informally) that\nincrease sentences beyond the minimum required by the\njury\u2019s verdict. For example, under a statute providing\nthat the punishment for burglary is, say, imprisonment for\nup to x years, the sentencing court might increase the\nsentence that it would have otherwise imposed by some\namount based on evidence introduced at trial that the\ndefendant was armed or that, before committing the\ncrime, the defendant had told a confederate that he would\nkill the occupants if they awakened during the burglary.\nThe only difference between this sort of factfinding and\nthe type that occurs under a guidelines system is that\nfactfinding under a guidelines system is explicit and the\neffect of each critical finding is quantified. But in both\ninstances, facts that cause a defendant to spend more time\nin prison are found by judges, not juries, and therefore no\ndistinction can be drawn as a matter of Sixth Amendment\nprinciple.\n   The Court\u2019s acceptance of this distinction also produced\nstrange collateral consequences. A sentencing system that\ngives trial judges the discretion to sentence within a speci\nfied range not only permits judicial factfinding that may\nincrease a sentence, such a system also gives individual\njudges discretion to implement their own sentencing poli\ncies. This latter feature, whether wise or unwise, has\nnothing to do with the concerns of the Sixth Amendment,\nand a principal objective of the Sentencing Reform Act was\nto take this power out of the hands of individual district\njudges.\n   The Booker remedy, however, undid this congressional\nchoice. In curing the Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s perceived\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ninterpreting the First Amendment); Carroll v. United States, 267 U.

S. ____ (2007)            7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ndefect regarding judicial factfinding, Booker restored to\nthe district courts at least a measure of the policymaking\nauthority that the Sentencing Reform Act had taken away.\n(How much of this authority was given back is, of course,\nthe issue here.)\n   I recognize that the Court is committed to the Blakely-\nBooker line of cases, but we are not required to continue\nalong a path that will take us further and further off\ncourse. Because the Booker remedial opinion may be read\nto require sentencing judges to give weight to the Guide\nlines, I would adopt that interpretation and thus minimize\nthe gap between what the Sixth Amendment requires and\nwhat our cases have held.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   Read fairly, the opinion of the Court of Appeals holds\nthat the District Court did not properly exercise its sen\ntencing discretion because it did not give sufficient weight\nto the policy decisions reflected in the Guidelines. Peti\ntioner was convicted of a serious crime, conspiracy to\ndistribute \u201cecstasy.\u201d He distributed thousands of pills and\nmade between $30,000 and $40,000 in profit. Although he\neventually left the conspiracy, he did so because he was\nworried about apprehension. The Sentencing Guidelines\ncalled for a term of imprisonment of 30 to 37 months, but\nthe District Court imposed a term of probation.\n   Compelled to interpret the Booker remedial opinion, the\nDistrict Court, it appears, essentially chose the interpreta\ntion outlined in JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 and JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s\ndissents. The District Court considered the sentence\ncalled for by the Guidelines, but I see no evidence that the\nDistrict Court deferred to the Guidelines to any significant\ndegree. Rather, the court determined what it thought was\nappropriate under the circumstances and sentenced peti\ntioner accordingly.\n8                 GALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   If the question before us was whether a reasonable\njurist could conclude that a sentence of probation was\nsufficient in this case to serve the purposes of punishment\nset out in 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(2), the District Court\u2019s\ndecision could not be disturbed. But because I believe that\nsentencing judges must still give some significant weight\nto the Guidelines sentencing range, the Commission\u2019s\npolicy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted\nsentencing disparities, \u00a73553(a)(3), (4), and (5) (2000 ed.\nand Supp. V), I agree with the Eighth Circuit that the\nDistrict Court did not properly exercise its discretion.\n   Appellate review for abuse of discretion is not an empty\nformality. A decision calling for the exercise of judicial\ndiscretion \u201chardly means that it is unfettered by meaning\nful standards or shielded from thorough appellate review.\u201d\nAlbemarle Paper Co. v.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(3), (4), and (5) (2000 ed. and Supp.\nV)\u2014namely, the Guidelines sentencing range, the Com\nmission\u2019s policy statements, and the need to avoid unwar\nranted sentencing disparities. Although the Guidelines\ncalled for a prison term of at least 30 months, the District\nCourt did not require any imprisonment\u2014not one day.\nThe opinion of the Court makes much of the restrictions\nand burdens of probation, see ante, at 9\u201310, but in the real\nworld there is a huge difference between imprisonment\nand probation. If the District Court had given any appre\nciable weight to the Guidelines, the District Court could\nnot have sentenced petitioner to probation without very\nstrong countervailing considerations.\n  The court listed five considerations as justification for a\nsentence of probation: (1) petitioner\u2019s \u201cvoluntary and\nexplicit withdrawal from the conspiracy,\u201d (2) his \u201cexem\nplary behavior while on bond,\u201d (3) \u201cthe support manifested\nby family and friends,\u201d (4) \u201cthe lack of criminal history,\nespecially a complete lack of any violent criminal history,\u201d\n(5) and his age at the time of the offense, 21. App. 97.\n  Two of the considerations that the District Court cited\u2014\n\u201cthe support manifested by family and friends\u201d and his\nage, ibid.\u2014amounted to a direct rejection of the Sentenc\ning Commission\u2019s authority to decide the most basic issues\nof sentencing policy. In the Sentencing Reform Act, Con\ngress required the Sentencing Commission to consider and\ndecide whether certain specified factors\u2014including \u201cage,\u201d\n10                 GALL v.

S. C. \u00a7994(d).\nThese factors come up with great frequency, and judges in\nthe pre-Sentencing Reform Act era disagreed regarding\ntheir relevance. Indeed, some of these factors were viewed\nby some judges as reasons for increasing a sentence and\nby others as reasons for decreasing a sentence. For exam\nple, if a defendant had a job, a supportive family, and\nfriends, those factors were sometimes viewed as justifying\na harsher sentence on the ground that the defendant had\nsquandered the opportunity to lead a law-abiding life.\nAlternatively, those same factors were sometimes viewed\nas justifications for a more lenient sentence on the ground\nthat a defendant with a job and a network of support\nwould be less likely to return to crime. If each judge is\nfree to implement his or her personal views on such mat\nters, sentencing disparities are inevitable.\n   In response to Congress\u2019 direction to establish uniform\nnational sentencing policies regarding these common\nsentencing factors, the Sentencing Commission issued\npolicy statements concluding that \u201cage,\u201d \u201cfamily ties,\u201d and\n\u201ccommunity ties\u201d are relevant to sentencing only in un\nusual cases. See United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a75H1.1 (age), 5H1.6 (family and\ncommunity ties) (Nov. 2006). The District Court in this\ncase did not claim that there was anything particularly\nunusual about petitioner\u2019s family or community ties or his\nage, but the court cited these factors as justifications for a\nsentence of probation. Although the District Court was\nobligated to take into account the Commission\u2019s policy\nstatements and the need to avoid sentencing disparities,\nthe District Court rejected Commission policy statements\nthat are critical to the effort to reduce such disparities.\n   The District Court relied on petitioner\u2019s lack of criminal\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

Conse\nquently, giving petitioner additional credit for this factor\nwas nothing more than an expression of disagreement\nwith the policy determination reflected in the Guidelines\nrange.\n  The District Court mentioned petitioner\u2019s \u201cexemplary\nbehavior while on bond,\u201d App. 97, but this surely cannot\nbe regarded as a weighty factor.\n  Finally, the District Court was plainly impressed by\npetitioner\u2019s \u201cvoluntary and explicit withdrawal from the\nconspiracy.\u201d Ibid. As the Government argues, the legiti\nmate strength of this factor is diminished by petitioner\u2019s\nmotivation in withdrawing. He did not leave the conspir\nacy for reasons of conscience, and he made no effort to stop\nthe others in the ring. He withdrew because he had be\ncome afraid of apprehension. 446 F. 3d 884, 886 (CA8\n2006). While the District Court was within its rights\nin regarding this factor and petitioner\u2019s \u201cself\nrehabilitat[ion],\u201d App. 75, as positive considerations, they\nare not enough, in light of the Guidelines\u2019 call for a 30- to\n37-month prison term, to warrant a sentence of probation.\n                             B\n  In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court attacks\nstraw men. The Court unjustifiably faults the Eighth\nCircuit for using what it characterizes as a \u201crigid mathe\nmatical formula.\u201d Ante, at 8. The Eighth Circuit (follow\ning a Seventh Circuit opinion) stated that a trial judge\u2019s\njustifications for a sentence outside the Guidelines range\nmust be \u201cproportional to the extent of the difference be\ntween the advisory range and the sentence imposed.\u201d 446\nF. 3d, at 889 (quoting United States v.

Taking this language literally\nas requiring a mathematical computation, the Court has\nan easy time showing that mathematical precision is not\npossible:\n     \u201c[T]he mathematical approach assumes the existence\n     of some ascertainable method of assigning percent\n     ages to various justifications. Does withdrawal from a\n     conspiracy justify more or less than, say, a 30% reduc\n     tion? . . . What percentage, if any, should be assigned\n     to evidence that a defendant poses no future threat to\n     society, or to evidence that innocent third parties are\n     dependent on him?\u201d Ante, at 10.\n   This criticism is quite unfair. It is apparent that the\nSeventh and Eighth Circuits did not mean to suggest that\nproportionality review could be reduced to a mathematical\nequation, and certainly the Eighth Circuit in this case did\nnot assign numbers to the various justifications offered by\nthe District Court. All that the Seventh and Eighth Cir\ncuits meant, I am convinced, is what this Court\u2019s opinion\nstates, i.e., that \u201cthe extent of the difference between a\nparticular sentence and the recommended Guidelines\nrange\u201d is a relevant consideration in determining whether\nthe District Court properly exercised its sentencing discre\ntion. Ante, at 2.\n   This Court\u2019s opinion is also wrong in suggesting that the\nEighth Circuit\u2019s approach was inconsistent with the\nabuse-of-discretion standard of appellate review. Ante, at\n10. The Eighth Circuit stated unequivocally that it was\nconducting abuse-of-discretion review, 446 F. 3d, at 888\u2013\n889; abuse-of-discretion review is not toothless; and it is\nentirely proper for a reviewing court to find an abuse of\ndiscretion when important factors\u2014in this case, the\nGuidelines, policy statements, and the need to avoid sen\ntencing disparities\u2014are \u201cslighted.\u201d Taylor, 487 U.

The first, <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), involved a sentence <i>within</i> the range recommended by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines; we held that when a district judge's discretionary decision in a particular case accords with the sentence the United States Sentencing Commission deems appropriate \"in the mine run of cases,\" the court of appeals may presume that the sentence is reasonable. <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2465.</p>\n<p>The second case, <i>Claiborne v. United States</i><i>,</i> involved a sentence <i>below</i> the range recommended by the Guidelines, and raised the converse question whether a court of appeals may apply a \"proportionality test,\" and require that a sentence that constitutes a substantial variance from the Guidelines be justified by extraordinary circumstances. See <i>Claiborne v. United States,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006). We did not have the opportunity to answer this question because the case was mooted by Claiborne's untimely death. <i>Claiborne v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2245, 167 L.Ed.2d 1080 (2007) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> We granted certiorari in the case before us today in order to reach that question, left unanswered last Term. 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2933, 168 L.Ed.2d 261 (2007). We now hold that, while the extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range is surely relevant, courts of appeals must review all sentences \u0097 whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range \u0097 under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. We also hold that the sentence imposed by the experienced District Judge in this case was reasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In February or March 2000, petitioner Brian Gall, a second-year college student at the University of Iowa, was invited by Luke Rinderknecht to join an ongoing enterprise <span class=\"star-pagination\">*592</span> distributing a controlled substance popularly known as \"ecstasy.\"<sup>[1]</sup> Gall \u0097 who was then a user of ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana \u0097 accepted the invitation. During the ensuing seven months, Gall delivered ecstasy pills, which he received from Rinderknecht, to other conspirators, who then sold them to consumers. He netted over $30,000.</p>\n<p>A month or two after joining the conspiracy, Gall stopped using ecstasy. A few months after that, in September 2000, he advised Rinderknecht and other co-conspirators that he was withdrawing from the conspiracy. He has not sold illegal drugs of any kind since. He has, in the words of the District Court, \"self-rehabilitated.\" App. 75. He graduated from the University of Iowa in 2002, and moved first to Arizona, where he obtained a job in the construction industry, and later to Colorado, where he earned $18 per hour as a master carpenter. He has not used any illegal drugs since graduating from college.</p>\n<p>After Gall moved to Arizona, he was approached by federal law enforcement agents who questioned him about his involvement in the ecstasy distribution conspiracy. Gall admitted his limited participation in the distribution of ecstasy, and the agents took no further action at that time. On April 28, 2004 \u0097 approximately a year and a half after this initial interview, and three and a half years after Gall withdrew from the conspiracy \u0097 an indictment was returned in the Southern District of Iowa charging him and seven other defendants with participating in a conspiracy to distribute ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana, that began in or about May 1996 and continued through October 30, 2002. The Government has never questioned the truthfulness of any of Gall's earlier statements or contended that he played any role in, or had any knowledge of, other aspects of the conspiracy described in the indictment. When he received notice of the indictment, Gall moved back to Iowa and surrendered to the authorities. While free on his own recognizance, Gall started his own business in the construction industry, primarily engaged in subcontracting for the installation of windows and doors. In his first year, his profits were over $2,000 per month.</p>\n<p>Gall entered into a plea agreement with the Government, stipulating that he was \"responsible for, but did not necessarily distribute himself, at least 2,500 grams of [ecstasy], or the equivalent of at least 87.5 kilograms of marijuana.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 25. In the agreement, the Government acknowledged that by \"on or about September of 2000,\" Gall had communicated his intent to stop distributing ecstasy to Rinderknecht and other members of the conspiracy. <i>Ibid.</i> The agreement further provided that recent changes in the Guidelines that enhanced the recommended punishment for distributing ecstasy were not applicable to Gall because he had withdrawn from the conspiracy prior to the effective date of those changes.</p>\n<p>In her presentence report, the probation officer concluded that Gall had no significant criminal history; that he was not an organizer, leader, or manager; and that his offense did not involve the use of any weapons. The report stated that Gall had truthfully provided the Government with all of the evidence he had concerning the alleged offenses, but that his evidence was not useful because he provided no new information to the agents. The report also described Gall's substantial use of drugs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*593</span> prior to his offense and the absence of any such use in recent years. The report recommended a sentencing range of 30 to 37 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The record of the sentencing hearing held on May 27, 2005, includes a \"small flood\" of letters from Gall's parents and other relatives, his fiance, neighbors, and representatives of firms doing business with him, uniformly praising his character and work ethic. The transcript includes the testimony of several witnesses and the District Judge's colloquy with the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) and with Gall. The AUSA did not contest any of the evidence concerning Gall's law-abiding life during the preceding five years, but urged that \"the Guidelines are appropriate and should be followed,\" and requested that the court impose a prison sentence within the Guidelines range. <i>Id.,</i> at 93. He mentioned that two of Gall's coconspirators had been sentenced to 30 and 35 months, respectively, but upon further questioning by the District Court, he acknowledged that neither of them had voluntarily withdrawn from the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>The District Judge sentenced Gall to probation for a term of 36 months. In addition to making a lengthy statement on the record, the judge filed a detailed sentencing memorandum explaining his decision, and provided the following statement of reasons in his written judgment:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Court determined that, considering all the factors under 18 U.S.C. 3553(a), the Defendant's explicit withdrawal from the conspiracy almost four years before the filing of the Indictment, the Defendant's post-offense conduct, especially obtaining a college degree and the start of his own successful business, the support of family and friends, lack of criminal history, and his age at the time of the offense conduct, all warrant the sentence imposed, which was sufficient, but not greater than necessary to serve the purposes of sentencing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 117.</blockquote>\n<p>At the end of both the sentencing hearing and the sentencing memorandum, the District Judge reminded Gall that probation, rather than \"an act of leniency,\" is a \"substantial restriction of freedom.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 99, 125. In the memorandum, he emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Gall] will have to comply with strict reporting conditions along with a three-year regime of alcohol and drug testing. He will not be able to change or make decisions about significant circumstances in his life, such as where to live or work, which are prized liberty interests, without first seeking authorization from his Probation Officer or, perhaps, even the Court. Of course, the Defendant always faces the harsh consequences that await if he violates the conditions of his probationary term.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 125.</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the District Judge explained why he had concluded that the sentence of probation reflected the seriousness of Gall's offense and that no term of imprisonment was necessary:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Any term of imprisonment in this case would be counter effective by depriving society of the contributions of the Defendant who, the Court has found, understands the consequences of his criminal conduct and is doing everything in his power to forge a new life. The Defendant's post-offense conduct indicates neither that he will return to criminal behavior nor that the Defendant is a danger to society. In fact, the Defendant's post-offense conduct was not motivated by a desire to please the Court or any other governmental agency, but was the pre-Indictment product of the Defendant's own desire to lead a better life.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 125-126.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*594</span> II</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for resentencing. Relying on its earlier opinion in <i>United States v. Claiborne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793477\"><a href=\"/opinion/793477/united-states-v-mario-claiborne/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span> (C.A.8 2006), it held that a sentence outside of the Guidelines range must be supported by a justification that \"`\"is proportional to the extent of the difference between the advisory range and the sentence imposed.\"'\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794213\"><a href=\"/opinion/794213/united-states-v-brian-michael-gall/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span>, 889 (C.A.8 2006) (quoting <i>Claiborne,</i> 439 F.3d, at 481, in turn quoting <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792280\"><a href=\"/opinion/792280/united-states-v-allan-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span>, 426-427 (C.A.7 2005)). Characterizing the difference between a sentence of probation and the bottom of Gall's advisory Guidelines range of 30 months as \"extraordinary\" because it amounted to \"a 100% downward variance,\" 446 F.3d, at 889, the Court of Appeals held that such a variance must be \u0097 and here was not \u0097 supported by extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p>Rather than making an attempt to quantify the value of the justifications provided by the District Judge, the Court of Appeals identified what it regarded as five separate errors in the District Judge's reasoning: (1) He gave \"too much weight to Gall's withdrawal from the conspiracy\"; (2) given that Gall was 21 at the time of his offense, the District Judge erroneously gave \"significant weight\" to studies showing impetuous behavior by persons under the age of 18; (3) he did not \"properly weigh\" the seriousness of Gall's offense; (4) he failed to consider whether a sentence of probation would result in \"unwarranted\" disparities; and (5) he placed \"too much emphasis on Gall's post-offense rehabilitation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 889-890. As we shall explain, we are not persuaded that these factors, whether viewed separately or in the aggregate, are sufficient to support the conclusion that the District Judge abused his discretion. As a preface to our discussion of these particulars, however, we shall explain why the Court of Appeals' rule requiring \"proportional\" justifications for departures from the Guidelines range is not consistent with our remedial opinion in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In <i>Booker</i> we invalidated both the statutory provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which made the Sentencing Guidelines mandatory, and \u00a7 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which directed appellate courts to apply a <i>de novo</i> standard of review to departures from the Guidelines. As a result of our decision, the Guidelines are now advisory, and appellate review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are \"reasonable.\" Our explanation of \"reasonableness\" review in the <i>Booker</i> opinion made it pellucidly clear that the familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions. See 543 U.S., at 260-262, 125 S.Ct. 738; see also <i>Rita,</i> 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456 (STEVENS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>It is also clear that a district judge must give serious consideration to the extent of any departure from the Guidelines and must explain his conclusion that an unusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence is appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications. For even though the Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory, they are, as we pointed out in <i>Rita,</i> the product of careful study based on extensive empirical evidence derived from the review of thousands of individual sentencing decisions.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p>In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the Guidelines range, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*595</span> appellate courts may therefore take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines. We reject, however, an appellate rule that requires \"extraordinary\" circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range. We also reject the use of a rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the approaches we reject come too close to creating an impermissible presumption of unreasonableness for sentences outside the Guidelines range. See <i>id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2467 (\"The fact that we permit courts of appeals to adopt a presumption of reasonableness does not mean that courts may adopt a presumption of unreasonableness\").<sup>[3]</sup> Even the Government has acknowledged that such a presumption would not be consistent with <i>Booker.</i> See Brief for United States in <i>Rita v. United States</i><i>,</i> O.T.2006, No. 06-5754, pp. 34-35.</p>\n<p>The mathematical approach also suffers from infirmities of application. On one side of the equation, deviations from the Guidelines range will always appear more extreme \u0097 in percentage terms \u0097 when the range itself is low, and a sentence of probation will always be a 100% departure regardless of whether the Guidelines range is 1 month or 100 years. Moreover, quantifying the variance as a certain percentage of the maximum, minimum, or median prison sentence recommended by the Guidelines gives no weight to the \"substantial restriction of freedom\" involved in a term of supervised release or probation. App. 95.</p>\n<p>We recognize that custodial sentences are qualitatively more severe than probationary sentences of equivalent terms. Offenders on probation are nonetheless subject to several standard conditions that substantially restrict their liberty. See <i>United States v. Knights,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118468\"><a href=\"/opinion/118468/united-states-v-knights/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 119, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001) (\"Inherent in the very nature of probation is that probationers `do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled'\" (quoting <i>Griffin v. Wisconsin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111959\"><a href=\"/opinion/111959/griffin-v-wisconsin/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span>, 874, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987))).<sup>[4]</sup> Probationers may not leave <span class=\"star-pagination\">*596</span> the judicial district, move, or change jobs without notifying, and in some cases receiving permission from, their probation officer or the court. They must report regularly to their probation officer, permit unannounced visits to their homes, refrain from associating with any person convicted of a felony, and refrain from excessive drinking. USSG \u00a7 5B1.3. Most probationers are also subject to individual \"special conditions\" imposed by the court. Gall, for instance, may not patronize any establishment that derives more than 50% of its revenue from the sale of alcohol, and must submit to random drug tests as directed by his probation officer. App. 109.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the equation, the mathematical approach assumes the existence of some ascertainable method of assigning percentages to various justifications. Does withdrawal from a conspiracy justify more or less than, say, a 30% reduction? Does it matter that the withdrawal occurred several years ago? Is it relevant that the withdrawal was motivated by a decision to discontinue the use of drugs and to lead a better life? What percentage, if any, should be assigned to evidence that a defendant poses no future threat to society, or to evidence that innocent third parties are dependent on him? The formula is a classic example of attempting to measure an inventory of apples by counting oranges.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Most importantly, both the exceptional circumstances requirement and the rigid mathematical formulation reflect a practice \u0097 common among courts that have adopted \"proportional review\" \u0097 of applying a heightened standard of review to sentences outside the Guidelines range. This is inconsistent with the rule that the abuse-of-discretion standard of review applies to appellate review of all sentencing decisions \u0097 whether inside or outside the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p>As we explained in <i>Rita,</i> a district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range. See 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456. As a matter of administration and to secure nationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark. The Guidelines are not the only consideration, however. Accordingly, after giving both parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate, the district judge should then consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.<sup>[6]</sup> In so doing, he may not presume <span class=\"star-pagination\">*597</span> that the Guidelines range is reasonable. See <i>id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456. He must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented. If he decides that an outside-Guidelines sentence is warranted, he must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance. We find it uncontroversial that a major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one. After settling on the appropriate sentence, he must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing. <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. It must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u0097 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range. Assuming that the district court's sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. When conducting this review, the court will, of course, take into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range. If the sentence is within the Guidelines range, the appellate court may, but is not required to, apply a presumption of reasonableness. <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456. But if the sentence is outside the Guidelines range, the court may not apply a presumption of unreasonableness. It may consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court's decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance. The fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.</p>\n<p>Practical considerations also underlie this legal principle. \"The sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) in the individual case. The judge sees and hears the evidence, makes credibility determinations, has full knowledge of the facts and gains insights not conveyed by the record.\" Brief for Federal Public and Community Defenders et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 16. \"The sentencing judge has access to, and greater familiarity with, the individual case and the individual defendant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*598</span> before him than the Commission or the appeals court.\" <i>Rita,</i> 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2469. Moreover, \"[d]istrict courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations, especially as they see so many more Guidelines sentences than appellate courts do.\" <i>Koon v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>\"It has been uniform and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 113, 116 S.Ct. 2035.<sup>[8]</sup> The uniqueness of the individual case, however, does not change the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review that applies to all sentencing decisions. As we shall now explain, the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case does not reflect the requisite deference and does not support the conclusion that the District Court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>As an initial matter, we note that the District Judge committed no significant procedural error. He correctly calculated the applicable Guidelines range, allowed both parties to present arguments as to what they believed the appropriate sentence should be, considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and thoroughly documented his reasoning. The Court of Appeals found that the District Judge erred in failing to give proper weight to the seriousness of the offense, as required by \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and failing to consider whether a sentence of probation would create unwarranted disparities, as required by \u00a7 3553(a)(6). We disagree.</p>\n<p>Section 3553(a)(2)(A) requires judges to consider \"the need for the sentence imposed... to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\" The Court of Appeals concluded that \"the district court did not properly weigh the seriousness of Gall's offense\" because it \"ignored the serious health risks ecstasy poses.\" 446 F.3d, at 890. Contrary to the Court of Appeals' conclusion, the District Judge plainly did consider the seriousness of the offense. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. 99 (\"The Court, however, is bound to impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness <span class=\"star-pagination\">*599</span> of joining a conspiracy to distribute MDMA or ecstasy\"); <i>id.,</i> at 122.<sup>[9]</sup> It is true that the District Judge did not make specific reference to the (unquestionably significant) health risks posed by ecstasy, but the prosecutor did not raise ecstasy's effects at the sentencing hearing. Had the prosecutor raised the issue, specific discussion of the point might have been in order, but it was not incumbent on the District Judge to raise every conceivably relevant issue on his own initiative.</p>\n<p>The Government's legitimate concern that a lenient sentence for a serious offense threatens to promote disrespect for the law is at least to some extent offset by the fact that seven of the eight defendants in this case have been sentenced to significant prison terms. Moreover, the unique facts of Gall's situation provide support for the District Judge's conclusion that, in Gall's case, \"a sentence of imprisonment may work to promote not respect, but derision, of the law if the law is viewed as merely a means to dispense harsh punishment without taking into account the real conduct and circumstances involved in sentencing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 126.</p>\n<p>Section 3553(a)(6) requires judges to consider \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\" The Court of Appeals stated that \"the record does not show that the district court considered whether a sentence of probation would result in unwarranted disparities.\" 446 F.3d, at 890. As with the seriousness of the offense conduct, avoidance of unwarranted disparities was clearly considered by the Sentencing Commission when setting the Guidelines ranges. Since the District Judge correctly calculated and carefully reviewed the Guidelines range, he necessarily gave significant weight and consideration to the need to avoid unwarranted disparities.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as we understand the colloquy between the District Judge and the AUSA, it seems that the judge gave specific attention to the issue of disparity when he inquired about the sentences already imposed by a different judge on two of Gall's codefendants. The AUSA advised the District Judge that defendant Harbison had received a 30-month sentence and that Gooding had received 35 months. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: ... You probably know more about this than anybody. How long did those two stay in the conspiracy, and did they voluntarily withdraw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"MR GRIESS: They did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: They did not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"MR. GRIESS: They did not voluntarily withdraw. And they were in the conspiracy, I think, for a shorter period of time, but at the very end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"MR. GRIESS: A significant difference there, Your Honor, is that they were in the conspiracy after the guidelines changed and, therefore, were sentenced at a much higher level because of that.\" App. 88.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*600</span> A little later Mr. Griess stated: \"The last thing I want to talk about goes to sentencing disparity. ... Obviously, the Court is cognizant of that and wants to avoid any unwarranted sentencing disparities.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 89. He then discussed at some length the sentence of 36 months imposed on another codefendant, Jarod Yoder, whose participation in the conspiracy was roughly comparable to Gall's. Griess voluntarily acknowledged three differences between Yoder and Gall: Yoder was in the conspiracy at its end and therefore was sentenced under the more severe Guidelines, he had a more serious criminal history, and he did not withdraw from the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>From these facts, it is perfectly clear that the District Judge considered the need to avoid unwarranted disparities, but also considered the need to avoid unwarranted <i>similarities</i> among other co-conspirators who were not similarly situated. The District Judge regarded Gall's voluntary withdrawal as a reasonable basis for giving him a less severe sentence than the three codefendants discussed with the AUSA, who neither withdrew from the conspiracy nor rehabilitated themselves as Gall had done. We also note that neither the Court of Appeals nor the Government has called our attention to a comparable defendant who received a more severe sentence.</p>\n<p>Since the District Court committed no procedural error, the only question for the Court of Appeals was whether the sentence was reasonable \u0097 <i>i.e.,</i> whether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported a sentence of probation and justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range. As we shall now explain, the sentence was reasonable. The Court of Appeals' decision to the contrary was incorrect and failed to demonstrate the requisite deference to the District Judge's decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals gave virtually no deference to the District Court's decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justified a significant variance in this case. Although the Court of Appeals correctly stated that the appropriate standard of review was abuse of discretion, it engaged in an analysis that more closely resembled <i>de novo</i> review of the facts presented and determined that, in its view, the degree of variance was not warranted.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals thought that the District Court \"gave too much weight to Gall's withdrawal from the conspiracy because the court failed to acknowledge the significant benefit Gall received from being subject to the 1999 Guidelines.\"<sup>[10]</sup> 446 F.3d, at 889. This criticism is flawed in that it ignores the critical relevance of Gall's voluntary withdrawal, a circumstance that distinguished his conduct not only from that of all his codefendants, but from the vast majority of defendants convicted of conspiracy in federal court. The District Court quite reasonably attached great weight to the fact that Gall voluntarily withdrew from the conspiracy after deciding, on his own initiative, to change his life. This lends strong support to the District Court's conclusion that Gall is not going to return to criminal behavior and is not a danger to society. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C). Compared to a case where the offender's rehabilitation occurred after he was charged with a crime, the District Court here had greater justification <span class=\"star-pagination\">*601</span> for believing Gall's turnaround was genuine, as distinct from a transparent attempt to build a mitigation case.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals thought the District Judge \"gave significant weight to an improper factor\" when he compared Gall's sale of ecstasy when he was a 21-year-old adult to the \"impetuous and ill-considered\" actions of persons under the age of 18. 446 F.3d, at 890. The appellate court correctly observed that the studies cited by the District Judge do not explain how Gall's \"specific behavior in the instant case was impetuous or ill-considered.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In that portion of his sentencing memorandum, however, the judge was discussing the \"character of the defendant,\" not the nature of his offense. App. 122. He noted that Gall's criminal history included a ticket for underage drinking when he was 18 years old and possession of marijuana that was contemporaneous with his offense in this case. In summary, the District Judge observed that all of Gall's criminal history \"including the present offense, occurred when he was twenty-one-years old or younger\" and appeared \"to stem from his addictions to drugs and alcohol.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 123. The District Judge appended a long footnote to his discussion of Gall's immaturity. The footnote includes an excerpt from our opinion in <i>Roper v. Simmons,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137749\"><a href=\"/opinion/137749/roper-v-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span>, 569, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005), which quotes a study stating that a lack of maturity and an undeveloped sense of responsibility are qualities that \"'often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions.'\" The District Judge clearly stated the relevance of these studies in the opening and closing sentences of the footnote:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Immaturity at the time of the offense conduct is not an inconsequential consideration. Recent studies on the development of the human brain conclude that human brain development may not become complete until the age of twenty-five.. . . [T]he recent [National Institute of Health] report confirms that there is no bold line demarcating at what age a person reaches full maturity. While age does not excuse behavior, a sentencing court should account for age when inquiring into the conduct of a defendant.\" App. 123, n. 2.</blockquote>\n<p>Given the dramatic contrast between Gall's behavior before he joined the conspiracy and his conduct after withdrawing, it was not unreasonable for the District Judge to view Gall's immaturity at the time of the offense as a mitigating factor, and his later behavior as a sign that he had matured and would not engage in such impetuous and ill-considered conduct in the future. Indeed, his consideration of that factor finds support in our cases. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112897\"><a href=\"/opinion/112897/johnson-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 367, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993) (holding that a jury was free to consider a 19-year-old defendant's youth when determining whether there was a probability that he would continue to commit violent acts in the future and stating that \"`youth is more than a chronological fact. It is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage'\" (quoting <i>Eddings v. Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110641\"><a href=\"/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 115, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982))).</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court of Appeals thought that, even if Gall's rehabilitation was dramatic and permanent, a sentence of probation for participation as a middleman in a conspiracy distributing 10,000 pills of ecstasy \"lies outside the range of choice dictated by the facts of the case.\" 446 F.3d, at 890. If the Guidelines were still mandatory, and assuming the facts did not justify a Guidelines-based downward departure, this would provide a sufficient basis for setting aside Gall's sentence because the Guidelines state that probation alone is not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*602</span> an appropriate sentence for comparable offenses.<sup>[11]</sup> But the Guidelines are not mandatory, and thus the \"range of choice dictated by the facts of the case\" is significantly broadened. Moreover, the Guidelines are only one of the factors to consider when imposing sentence, and \u00a7 3553(a)(3) directs the judge to consider sentences other than imprisonment.</p>\n<p>We also note that the Government did not argue below, and has not argued here, that a sentence of probation could never be imposed for a crime identical to Gall's. Indeed, it acknowledged that probation could be permissible if the record contained different \u0097 but in our view, no more compelling \u0097 mitigating evidence. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-38 (stating that probation could be an appropriate sentence, given the exact same offense, if \"there are compelling family circumstances where individuals will be very badly hurt in the defendant's family if no one is available to take care of them\").</p>\n<p>The District Court quite reasonably attached great weight to Gall's self-motivated rehabilitation, which was undertaken not at the direction of, or under supervision by, any court, but on his own initiative. This also lends strong support to the conclusion that imprisonment was not necessary to deter Gall from engaging in future criminal conduct or to protect the public from his future criminal acts. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals clearly disagreed with the District Judge's conclusion that consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justified a sentence of probation; it believed that the circumstances presented here were insufficient to sustain such a marked deviation from the Guidelines range. But it is not for the Court of Appeals to decide <i>de novo</i> whether the justification for a variance is sufficient or the sentence reasonable. On abuse-of-discretion review, the Court of Appeals should have given due deference to the District Court's reasoned and reasonable decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justified the sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), I wrote separately to state my view that any appellate review of sentences for substantive reasonableness will necessarily result in a sentencing scheme constitutionally indistinguishable from the mandatory Guidelines struck down in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Whether a sentencing scheme uses mandatory Guidelines, a \"proportionality test\" for Guidelines variances, or a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, there will be some sentences upheld only on the basis of additional judge-found facts.</p>\n<p>Although I continue to believe that substantive-reasonableness review is inherently flawed, I give <i>stare decisis</i> effect to the statutory holding of <i>Rita.</i> The highly deferential standard adopted by the Court today will result in far fewer unconstitutional sentences than the proportionality standard employed by the Eighth Circuit. Moreover, as I noted in <i>Rita,</i> the Court has not foreclosed as-applied constitutional challenges to sentences. The door therefore <span class=\"star-pagination\">*603</span> remains open for a defendant to demonstrate that his sentence, whether inside or outside the advisory Guidelines range, would not have been upheld but for the existence of a fact found by the sentencing judge and not by the jury.</p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court's opinion here, as I do in today's companion case of <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4292040</span></span>, which follow <i>United States v.

My disagreements with holdings in those earlier cases are not the stuff of formally perpetual dissent, but I see their objectionable points hexing our judgments today, see <i>id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456 (SOUTER, J., dissenting), and <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 272, 125 S.Ct. 738 (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). After <i>Booker's</i> remedial holding, I continue to think that the best resolution of the tension between substantial consistency throughout the system and the right of jury trial would be a new Act of Congress: reestablishing a statutory system of mandatory sentencing guidelines (though not identical to the original in all points of detail), but providing for jury findings of all facts necessary to set the upper range of sentencing discretion. See <i>Rita, supra,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2463-2464.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Consistent with my dissenting opinion in <i>Kimbrough v.

Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must give the policy decisions that are embodied in the Sentencing Guidelines at least some significant weight in making a sentencing decision. I would answer that question in the affirmative and would therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In <i>Booker,</i> a bare majority held that the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Sentencing Reform Act), as amended, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551 <i>et seq.,</i> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991 <i>et seq.,</i> violated the Sixth Amendment insofar as it required district judges to follow the United States Sentencing Guidelines, but another bare majority held that this defect could be remedied by excising the two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(b)(1) and 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), that made compliance with the Guidelines mandatory. As a result of these two holdings, the lower federal courts were instructed that the Guidelines must be regarded as \"effectively advisory,\" <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S., at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738, and that individual sentencing decisions are subject to appellate review for \"`reasonableness.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 262, 125 S.Ct. 738. The <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion did not explain exactly what it meant by a system of \"advisory\" guidelines or by \"reasonableness\" review, and the opinion is open to different interpretations.</p>\n<p>It is possible to read the opinion to mean that district judges, after giving the Guidelines a polite nod, may then proceed essentially as if the Sentencing Reform Act had never been enacted. This is how two of the dissents interpreted the Court's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*604</span> opinion. Justice STEVENS wrote that sentencing judges had \"regain[ed] the unconstrained discretion Congress eliminated in 1984\" when it enacted the Sentencing Reform Act. <i>Id.,</i> at 297, 125 S.Ct. 738. Justice SCALIA stated that \"logic compels the conclusion that the sentencing judge. . . has full discretion, as full as what he possessed before the Act was passed, to sentence anywhere within the statutory range.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 305, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>While this is a possible understanding of the remedial opinion, a better reading is that sentencing judges must still give the Guidelines' policy decisions some significant weight and that the courts of appeals must still police compliance. In a key passage, the remedial opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing. See 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(4), (5) (Supp.2004). <i>But compare post, at 305 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part) (claiming that the sentencing judge has the same discretion 'he possessed before the Act was passed').</i> The courts of appeals review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness. These features of the remaining system, while not the system Congress enacted, nonetheless <i>continue to move sentencing in Congress' preferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing disparities</i> while maintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize sentences where necessary.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264-265, 125 S.Ct. 738 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>The implication of this passage is that district courts are still required to give some deference to the policy decisions embodied in the Guidelines and that appellate review must monitor compliance. District courts must not only \"consult\" the Guidelines, they must \"take them into account.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. In addition, the passage distances the remedial majority from Justice SCALIA's position that, under an advisory Guidelines scheme, a district judge would have \"discretion to sentence anywhere within the ranges authorized by statute\" so long as the judge \"state[d] that `this court does not believe that the punishment set forth in the Guidelines is appropriate for this sort of offense.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 305, 125 S.Ct. 738 (opinion dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Moreover, in the passage quoted above and at other points in the remedial opinion, the Court expressed confidence that appellate review for reasonableness would help to avoid \"`excessive sentencing disparities'\" and \"would tend to iron out sentencing differences.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 263, 125 S.Ct. 738. Indeed, a major theme of the remedial opinion, as well as our decision last Term in <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), was that the post-<i>Booker</i> sentencing regime would still promote the Sentencing Reform Act's goal of reducing sentencing disparities. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2463, 2463-2464, 2467; <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 259-260, 263-264, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p>It is unrealistic to think this goal can be achieved over the long term if sentencing judges need only give lip service to the Guidelines. The other sentencing factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a) are so broad that they impose few real restraints on sentencing judges. See <i>id.,</i> at 305, 125 S.Ct. 738 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part). Thus, if judges are obligated to do no more than consult the Guidelines before deciding upon the sentence that is, in their independent judgment, sufficient to serve the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, federal sentencing will not \"move . . . in Congress' preferred direction.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738 (opinion of the Court). On the contrary, sentencing disparities will gradually increase. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*605</span> Appellate decisions affirming sentences that diverge from the Guidelines (such as the Court's decision today) will be influential, and the sentencing habits developed during the pre-<i>Booker</i> era will fade.</p>\n<p>Finally, in reading the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion, we should not forget the decision's constitutional underpinnings. <i>Booker</i> and its antecedents are based on the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. The Court has held that (at least under a mandatory guidelines system) a defendant has the right to have a jury, not a judge, find facts that increase the defendant's authorized sentence. See <i>id.,</i> at 230-232, 125 S.Ct. 738; <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 303-304, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). It is telling that the rules set out in the Court's opinion in the present case have nothing to do with juries or factfinding and, indeed, that not one of the facts that bears on petitioner's sentence is disputed. What is at issue, instead, is the allocation of the authority to decide issues of substantive sentencing policy, an issue on which the Sixth Amendment says absolutely nothing. The yawning gap between the Sixth Amendment and the Court's opinion should be enough to show that the <i>Blakely-Booker</i> line of cases has gone astray.</p>\n<p>In <i>Blakely,</i> the Court drew a distinction \u0097 between judicial factfinding under a guidelines system and judicial factfinding under a discretionary sentencing system, see 542 U.S., at 309-310, 124 S.Ct. 2531 \u0097 that, in my judgment, cannot be defended as a matter of principle. It would be a coherent principle to hold that any fact that increases a defendant's sentence beyond the minimum required by the jury's verdict of guilt must be found by a jury. Such a holding, however, would clash with accepted sentencing practice at the time of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment. By that time, many States had enacted criminal statutes that gave trial judges the discretion to select a sentence from within a prescribed range,<sup>[1]</sup> and the First Congress enacted federal criminal statutes that were cast in this mold. See An Act for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*606</span> Punishment of certain Crimes against the United States, 1 Stat. 112.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Under a sentencing system of this type, trial judges inevitably make findings of fact (albeit informally) that increase sentences beyond the minimum required by the jury's verdict. For example, under a statute providing that the punishment for burglary is, say, imprisonment for up to <i>x</i> years, the sentencing court might increase the sentence that it would have otherwise imposed by some amount based on evidence introduced at trial that the defendant was armed or that, before committing the crime, the defendant had told a confederate that he would kill the occupants if they awakened during the burglary. The only difference between this sort of factfinding and the type that occurs under a guidelines system is that factfinding under a guidelines system is explicit and the effect of each critical finding is quantified. But in both instances, facts that cause a defendant to spend more time in prison are found by judges, not juries, and therefore no distinction can be drawn as a matter of Sixth Amendment principle.</p>\n<p>The Court's acceptance of this distinction also produced strange collateral consequences. A sentencing system that gives trial judges the discretion to sentence within a specified range not only permits judicial factfinding that may increase a sentence, such a system also gives individual judges discretion to implement their own sentencing policies. This latter feature, whether wise or unwise, has nothing to do with the concerns of the Sixth Amendment, and a principal objective of the Sentencing Reform Act was to take this power out of the hands of individual district judges.</p>\n<p>The <i>Booker</i> remedy, however, undid this congressional choice. In curing the Sentencing Reform Act's perceived defect regarding judicial factfinding, <i>Booker</i> restored to the district courts at least a measure of the policymaking authority that the Sentencing Reform Act had taken away. (How much of this authority was given back is, of course, the issue here.)</p>\n<p>I recognize that the Court is committed to the <i>Blakely-Booker</i> line of cases, but we are not required to continue along a path that will take us further and further off course. Because the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion may be read to require sentencing judges to give weight to the Guidelines, I would adopt that interpretation and thus minimize the gap between what the Sixth Amendment requires and what our cases have held.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Read fairly, the opinion of the Court of Appeals holds that the District Court did not properly exercise its sentencing discretion because it did not give sufficient weight to the policy decisions reflected in the Guidelines. Petitioner was convicted of a serious crime, conspiracy to distribute \"ecstasy.\" He distributed thousands of pills and made between $30,000 and $40,000 in profit. Although he eventually <span class=\"star-pagination\">*607</span> left the conspiracy, he did so because he was worried about apprehension. The Sentencing Guidelines called for a term of imprisonment of 30 to 37 months, but the District Court imposed a term of probation.</p>\n<p>Compelled to interpret the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion, the District Court, it appears, essentially chose the interpretation outlined in Justice STEVENS' and Justice SCALIA's dissents. The District Court considered the sentence called for by the Guidelines, but I see no evidence that the District Court deferred to the Guidelines to any significant degree. Rather, the court determined what it thought was appropriate under the circumstances and sentenced petitioner accordingly.</p>\n<p>If the question before us was whether a reasonable jurist could conclude that a sentence of probation was sufficient in this case to serve the purposes of punishment set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), the District Court's decision could not be disturbed. But because I believe that sentencing judges must still give some significant weight to the Guidelines sentencing range, the Commission's policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, \u00a7 3553(a)(3), (4), and (5) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), I agree with the Eighth Circuit that the District Court did not properly exercise its discretion.</p>\n<p>Appellate review for abuse of discretion is not an empty formality.

The opinion of the Court makes much of the restrictions and burdens of probation, see <i>ante,</i> at 595-596, but in the real world there is a huge difference between imprisonment and probation. If the District Court had given any appreciable weight to the Guidelines, the District Court could not have sentenced petitioner to probation without very strong countervailing considerations.</p>\n<p>The court listed five considerations as justification for a sentence of probation: (1) petitioner's \"voluntary and explicit withdrawal from the conspiracy,\" (2) his \"exemplary behavior while on bond,\" (3) \"the support manifested by family and friends,\" (4) \"the lack of criminal history, especially a complete lack of any violent criminal history,\" (5) and his age at the time of the offense, 21. App. 97.</p>\n<p>Two of the considerations that the District Court cited \u0097 \"the support manifested by family and friends\" and his age, <i>ibid.</i> \u0097 amounted to a direct rejection of the Sentencing Commission's authority to decide the most basic issues of sentencing policy. In the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress required the Sentencing Commission to consider and decide whether certain specified factors \u0097 including \"age,\" \"education,\" \"previous employment record,\" \"physical condition,\" \"family ties and responsibilities,\" and \"community ties\" \u0097 \"have any relevance to the nature [and] extent . . . of an appropriate sentence.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(d). These factors come up with great frequency, and judges in the pre-Sentencing Reform Act era disagreed regarding their relevance. Indeed, some of these factors were viewed by some judges as reasons for increasing a sentence and by others as reasons for decreasing a sentence. For example, if a defendant had a job, a supportive family, and friends, those factors were sometimes viewed as justifying a harsher sentence on the ground that the defendant had squandered the opportunity to lead a law-abiding life. Alternatively, those same factors were sometimes viewed as justifications for a more lenient sentence on the ground that a defendant with a job and a network of support would be less likely to return to crime. If each judge is free to implement his or her personal views on such matters, sentencing disparities are inevitable.</p>\n<p>In response to Congress' direction to establish uniform national sentencing policies regarding these common sentencing factors, the Sentencing Commission issued policy statements concluding that \"age,\" \"family ties,\" and \"community ties\" are relevant to sentencing only in unusual cases. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a7 5H1.1 (age), 5H1.6 (family and community ties) (Nov.2006). The District Court in this case did not claim that there was anything particularly unusual about petitioner's family or community ties or his age, but the court cited these factors as justifications for a sentence of probation. Although the District Court was obligated to take into account the Commission's policy statements and the need to avoid sentencing disparities, the District Court rejected Commission policy statements that are critical to the effort to reduce such disparities.</p>\n<p>The District Court relied on petitioner's lack of criminal history, but criminal history (or the lack thereof) is a central factor in the calculation of the Guidelines range. Petitioner was given credit for his lack of criminal history in the calculation of his Guidelines sentence. Consequently, giving petitioner additional credit for this factor was nothing more than an expression of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*609</span> disagreement with the policy determination reflected in the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p>The District Court mentioned petitioner's \"exemplary behavior while on bond,\" App. 97, but this surely cannot be regarded as a weighty factor.</p>\n<p>Finally, the District Court was plainly impressed by petitioner's \"voluntary and explicit withdrawal from the conspiracy.\" <i>Ibid.</i> As the Government argues, the legitimate strength of this factor is diminished by petitioner's motivation in withdrawing. He did not leave the conspiracy for reasons of conscience, and he made no effort to stop the others in the ring. He withdrew because he had become afraid of apprehension. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794213\"><a href=\"/opinion/794213/united-states-v-brian-michael-gall/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span>, 886 (C.A.8 2006). While the District Court was within its rights in regarding this factor and petitioner's \"self-rehabilitat[ion],\" App. 75, as positive considerations, they are not enough, in light of the Guidelines' call for a 30- to 37-month prison term, to warrant a sentence of probation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court attacks straw men. The Court unjustifiably faults the Eighth Circuit for using what it characterizes as a \"rigid mathematical formula.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 596. The Eighth Circuit (following a Seventh Circuit opinion) stated that a trial judge's justifications for a sentence outside the Guidelines range must be \"proportional to the extent of the difference between the advisory range and the sentence imposed.\" 446 F.3d, at 889 (quoting <i>United States v. Claiborne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793477\"><a href=\"/opinion/793477/united-states-v-mario-claiborne/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 481 (C.A.8 2006), in turn quoting <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792280\"><a href=\"/opinion/792280/united-states-v-allan-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span>, 426-427 (C.A.7 2005); internal quotation marks omitted). Taking this language literally as requiring a mathematical computation, the Court has an easy time showing that mathematical precision is not possible:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he mathematical approach assumes the existence of some ascertainable method of assigning percentages to various justifications. Does withdrawal from a conspiracy justify more or less than, say, a 30% reduction? . . . What percentage, if any, should be assigned to evidence that a defendant poses no future threat to society, or to evidence that innocent third parties are dependent on him?\" <i>Ante,</i> at 596.</blockquote>\n<p>This criticism is quite unfair. It is apparent that the Seventh and Eighth Circuits did not mean to suggest that proportionality review could be reduced to a mathematical equation, and certainly the Eighth Circuit in this case did not assign numbers to the various justifications offered by the District Court. All that the Seventh and Eighth Circuits meant, I am convinced, is what this Court's opinion states, <i>i.e.,</i> that \"the extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range\" is a relevant consideration in determining whether the District Court properly exercised its sentencing discretion. <i>Ante,</i> at 592.</p>\n<p>This Court's opinion is also wrong in suggesting that the Eighth Circuit's approach was inconsistent with the abuse-of-discretion standard of appellate review. <i>Ante,</i> at 596. The Eighth Circuit stated unequivocally that it was conducting abuse-of-discretion review, 446 F.3d, at 888-889; abuse-of-discretion review is not toothless; and it is entirely proper for a reviewing court to find an abuse of discretion when important factors \u0097 in this case, the Guidelines, policy statements, and the need to avoid sentencing disparities \u0097 are \"slighted.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 487 U.S., at 337, 108 S.Ct. 2413. The mere fact that the Eighth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*610</span> Circuit reversed is hardly proof that the Eighth Circuit did not apply the correct standard of review.</p>\n<p>Because I believe that the Eighth Circuit correctly interpreted and applied the standards set out in the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion, I must respectfully dissent.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Ecstasy is sometimes called \"MDMA\" because its scientific name is \"methylenedioxy-methamphetamine.\" App. 24, 118.</p>\n<p>[2]  Notably, not all of the Guidelines are tied to this empirical evidence. For example, the Sentencing Commission departed from the empirical approach when setting the Guidelines range for drug offenses, and chose instead to key the Guidelines to the statutory mandatory minimum sentences that Congress established for such crimes. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1A1.1 (Nov.2006) (USSG). This decision, and its effect on a district judge's authority to deviate from the Guidelines range in a particular drug case, is addressed in <i>Kimbrough v.

As the Wickersham Commission said, probation is not merely `letting an offender off easily'\"); 1 N. Cohen, The Law of Probation and Parole \u00a7 7:9 (2d ed. 1999) (\"[T]he probation or parole conditions imposed on an individual can have a significant impact on both that person and society. ... Often these conditions comprehensively regulate significant facets of their day-to-day lives .... They may become subject to frequent searches by government officials, as well as to mandatory counseling sessions with a caseworker or psychotherapist\").</p>\n<p>[5]  Notably, when the Court of Appeals explained its disagreement with the District Judge's decision in this case, it made no attempt to quantify the strength of any of the mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p>[6]  Section 3553(a) lists seven factors that a sentencing court must consider. The first factor is a broad command to consider \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The second factor requires the consideration of the general purposes of sentencing, including:\n</p>\n<p>\"the need for the sentence imposed \u0097</p>\n<p>\"(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</p>\n<p>\"(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</p>\n<p>\"(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</p>\n<p>\"(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\" \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p>The third factor pertains to \"the kinds of sentences available,\" \u00a7 3553(a)(3); the fourth to the Sentencing Guidelines; the fifth to any relevant policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission; the sixth to \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities,\" \u00a7 3553(a)(6); and the seventh to \"the need to provide restitution to any victim,\" \u00a7 3553(a)(7). Preceding this list is a general directive to \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\" of sentencing described in the second factor. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The fact that \u00a7 3553(a) explicitly directs sentencing courts to consider the Guidelines supports the premise that district courts must begin their analysis with the Guidelines and remain cognizant of them throughout the sentencing process.</p>\n<p>[7]  District judges sentence, on average, 117 defendants every year. Administrative Office of United States Courts, 2006 Federal Court Management Statistics 167. The District Judge in this case, Judge Pratt, has sentenced over 990 offenders over the course of his career. <i>United States v. Likens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795855\"><a href=\"/opinion/795855/united-states-v-morris-k-likens/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span>, 827, n. 1 (C.A.8 2006) (Bright, J., dissenting). Only a relatively small fraction of these defendants appeal their sentence on reasonableness grounds. See <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S., at 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035 (\"In 1994, for example, 93.9% of Guidelines cases were not appealed\"); <i>Likens,</i> 464 F.3d, at 827, n. 1 (Bright, J., dissenting) (noting that the District Judge had sentenced hundreds of defendants and that \"[w]e have reviewed only a miniscule number of those cases\"); cf. United States Sentencing Commission, 2006 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics 135-152.</p>\n<p>[8]  It is particularly revealing that when we adopted an abuse-of-discretion standard in <i>Koon,</i> we explicitly rejected the Government's argument that <i>\"de novo</i> review of departure decisions is necessary `to protect against unwarranted disparities arising from the differing sentencing approaches of individual district judges.'\" 518 U.S., at 97, 116 S.Ct. 2035 (quoting Brief for United States in O.T. 1995, No. 94-1664, p. 12). Even then we were satisfied that a more deferential abuse-of-discretion standard could successfully balance the need to \"reduce unjustified disparities\" across the Nation and \"consider every convicted person as an individual.\" 518 U.S., at 113, 116 S.Ct. 2035.</p>\n<p>[9]  The District Judge also gave specific consideration to the fact \u0097 not directly taken into account by the Guidelines \u0097 that Gall netted $30,000 from his participation in the conspiracy. He noted, however:\n</p>\n<p>\"[T]his fact can be viewed from different perspectives. On the one hand, [Gall] should be punished for profiting from a criminal scheme. ... On the other hand, [Gall], who is from a working-class family and has few financial resources, decided to turn his back on what, for him, was a highly profitable venture.... The Court can not consider, for the purposes of sentencing, one side of the financial aspect of the offense conduct without considering the other.\" App. 123-124, n. 3.</p>\n<p>[10]  The Court of Appeals explained that under the current Guidelines, which treat ecstasy more harshly, Gall's base offense level would have been 32, eight levels higher than the base offense level imposed under the 1999 Guidelines.</p>\n<p>[11]  Specifically, probation is not recommended under the Guidelines when the applicable Guidelines range is outside Zone A of the sentencing table as it is here. USSG \u00a7 5B1.1.</p>\n<p>[1]  To take some examples, Connecticut, as of 1784, punished burglary and robbery without violence with imprisonment of up to 10 years \"at the Discretion of the Superior Court before whom the Conviction is had.\" See Acts and Laws of the State of Connecticut 18 (1784). A 1749 Delaware law punished assault of a parent with imprisonment of up to 18 months. Laws of the State of Delaware 306 (1797). A 1793 Maryland law gave courts the ability to \"in their discretion, adjudge\" criminal defendants \"to serve and labour for any time, in their discretion, not exceeding\" specified terms of years. Digest of the Laws of Maryland 196 (T. Herty 1799). By 1785, Massachusetts allowed judges to sentence criminals convicted of a variety of offenses, including assault and manslaughter, \"according to the aggravation of the offense,\" or \"at the discretion of the Court.\" The Perpetual Laws, of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, from the Establishment of its Constitution to the First Session of the General Court A.D. 1788 (1788), reprinted in The First Laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, pp. 244-252 (J. Cushing comp.1981). In 1791, New Hampshire passed a law punishing certain assaults with imprisonment of up to two years, and forgery with imprisonment of up to three years, at the court's discretion. See Laws of the State of New Hampshire (1792). New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and South Carolina likewise enacted criminal statutes providing for indeterminate sentences of imprisonment at the discretion of the court either before, or in the immediate wake of, the ratification of the Sixth Amendment. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Laws of the State of New Jersey 210-218 (1800) (detailing laws passed in 1796); 2 Laws of the State of New York 45-48, 211, 242-248, 390 (1789); Laws of the State of North Carolina 288, 389 (J. Iredell 1791); An Abridgment of the Laws of Pennsylvania, Penal Laws 1-47 (1801) (detailing laws passed 1790-1794); Public Laws of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations 584-600 (1798); Public Laws of the State of South Carolina 55, 61, 257, 497 (J. Grimke 1790).</p>\n<p>[2]  We have often looked to laws passed by the First Congress to aide interpretation of the Bill of Rights, which that Congress proposed. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Harmelin v.
