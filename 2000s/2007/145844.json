Dreeben, Deputy Solicitor General, Daryl Joseffer, Assistant to the Solicitor General, Joel M. Gershowitz, Attorney, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioner James D. Logan pleaded guilty in a United States District Court to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Logan's record as a recidivist, which included three relevant state convictions, led the District Court to impose a 15-year prison term, the minimum sentence mandated by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*479</span> Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). For ACCA sentence-enhancement purposes, a prior conviction may be disregarded if the conviction \"has been expunged, or set aside,\" or the offender \"has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored.\" \u00a7 921(a)(20) (2000 ed.). None of Logan's prior convictions have been expunged or set aside. Nor has he been pardoned for any past crime. And, bearing importantly on the instant petition, the three state-court convictions that triggered Logan's ACCA-enhanced sentence occasioned no loss of civil rights.</p>\n<p>Challenging his enhanced sentence, Logan presents this question: Does the \"civil rights restored\" exemption contained in \u00a7 921(a)(20) encompass, and therefore remove from ACCA's reach, state-court convictions that at no time deprived the offender of civil rights? We hold that the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption provision does not cover the case of an offender who retained civil rights at all times, and whose legal status, postconviction, remained in all respects unaltered by any state dispensation.</p>\n<p>Section 921(a)(20) sets out postconviction events\u0097expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights\u0097that extend to an offender a measure of forgiveness, relieving him from some or all of the consequences of his conviction. Congress might have broadened the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption provision to cover convictions attended by no loss of civil rights. The national lawmakers, however, did not do so. Section 921(a)(20)'s failure to exempt convictions that do not revoke civil rights produces anomalies. But so does the extension of the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption that Logan advances. We are not equipped to say what statutory alteration, if any, Congress would have made had its attention trained on offenders who retained civil rights; nor can we recast \u00a7 921(a)(20) in Congress' stead.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Federal law generally prohibits the possession of a firearm by a person convicted of \"a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Ordinarily, the maximum felon-in-possession sentence is 10 years. See \u00a7 924(a)(2). If the offender's prior criminal record includes at least three convictions for \"violent felon[ies]\" or \"serious drug offense[s],\" however, the maximum sentence increases to life, and ACCA mandates a minimum term of 15 years. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>Congress defined the term \"violent felony\" to include specified crimes \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.). An offense classified by a State as a misdemeanor, however, may qualify as a \"violent felony\" for ACCA-enhancement purposes (or as a predicate for a felon-in-possession conviction under \u00a7 922(g)) only if the offense is punishable by more than two years in prison. \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B).</p>\n<p>In <i>Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc.,</i> 460 U.S. 103, 103 S.Ct. 986, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983), we held that a State's expungement of a conviction did not nullify the conviction for purposes of the firearms disabilities Congress placed in \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and (h)(1). In so ruling, we noted that our decision would ensure greater uniformity in federal sentences. See <i>id.,</i> at 119-120, 103 S.Ct. 986. Provisions for expungement \"var[ied] widely from State to State,\" we observed, <i>id.,</i> at 120, 103 S.Ct. 986, and yielded \"nothing less than a national patchwork,\" <i>id.,</i> at 122, 103 S.Ct. 986.</p>\n<p>In the Firearms Owners' Protection Act (FOPA), 100 Stat. 449 (1986), Congress amended \u00a7 921(a)(20) in response to <i>Dickerson's</i> holding that, for purposes of federal firearms disabilities, state law did <span class=\"star-pagination\">*480</span> not determine the present impact of a prior conviction. The amended provision excludes from qualification as a \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" (or a misdemeanor under state law punishable by more than two years in prison):</p>\n<blockquote>\"Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored ... unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20).<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>While \u00a7 921(a)(20) does not define the term \"civil rights,\" courts have held, and petitioner agrees, that the civil rights relevant under the above-quoted provision are the rights to vote, hold office, and serve on a jury. See Brief for Petitioner 13, n. 10; cf. <i>Caron v. United States,</i> 524 U.S. 308, 316, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (1998).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>On May 31, 2005, police officers responded to a domestic disturbance complaint made by Logan's girlfriend, Asenath Wilson. App. 9, 12. Wilson told the officers, among other things, that she had seen Logan with a gun and that he usually kept it in the car. <i>Ibid.</i> Logan, who was with Wilson when the police arrived, consented to a search of his car. <i>Id.,</i> at 11. In a hidden compartment behind the glove box, the officers found a 9-millimeter handgun. <i>Id.,</i> at 9-10, 12.</p>\n<p>Logan pleaded guilty to the federal offense of possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. <i>Id.,</i> at 12. (In 1991, he had been convicted in an Illinois court of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. <i>Id.,</i> at 9-10, 12.) The United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin sentenced Logan to imprisonment for 15 years, the mandatory minimum under ACCA. In imposing that enhanced sentence, the District Court took account of Logan's three Wisconsin misdemeanor battery convictions, each punishable by a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment. <i>Id.,</i> at 16-18.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Both in the District Court and on appeal, Logan argued that his Wisconsin <span class=\"star-pagination\">*481</span> misdemeanor convictions did not qualify as ACCA predicate offenses because they caused no loss of his civil rights. Rights retained, he urged, are functionally equivalent to rights revoked but later restored. If the exemption contained in \u00a7 921(a)(20) covered the three state-court misdemeanor convictions, Logan's maximum sentence, in lieu of the 15-year mandatory minimum under ACCA, would have been 10 years, see \u00a7 924(a)(2), and the United States Sentencing Guidelines would have indicated a sentence range of 37 to 46 months, see Brief for Petitioner 5. The District Court rejected Logan's argument, holding that the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption provision \"applies only to defendants whose civil rights were both lost and restored pursuant to state statutes.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. Accordingly, the court sentenced Logan to imprisonment for 15 years. <i>Id.,</i> at 12.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, concluding that \"an offender whose civil rights have been neither diminished nor returned is not a person who `has had civil rights restored.'\" 453 F.3d 804, 805 (2006). Logan's argument for treating retained rights the same way as restored rights, the appeals court observed, \"go[es] in the teeth of [\u00a7 921(a)(20)'s] text.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1251, 167 L.Ed.2d 72 (2007), to resolve a split among the Circuits as to whether \u00a7 921(a)(20)'s exception for \"civil rights restored\" should be interpreted to include civil rights retained at all times. Compare 453 F.3d, at 809 (case below) (\"civil rights restored\" does not include civil rights never revoked), and <i>McGrath v. United States,</i> 60 F.3d 1005 (C.A.2 1995) (same), with <i>United States v. Indelicato,</i> 97 F.3d 627, 631 (C.A.1 1996) (\"civil rights restored\" includes civil rights never lost).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Logan pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1), and received a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence because he had at least three prior convictions for \"violent felon[ies].\" \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). He acknowledges his convictions in Wisconsin for three battery offenses that facially qualify as violent felonies under \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B) (2000 ed.). See Brief for Petitioner 4-5. Thus the sole matter in dispute is whether Logan fits within the exemption from an ACCA-enhanced sentence for convictions \"expunged, or set aside\" or offenders who \"ha[ve] been pardoned or ha[ve] had civil rights restored.\" \u00a7 921(a)(20). None of Logan's battery convictions have been expunged, set aside, or pardoned. See 453 F.3d, at 809. Under Wisconsin law, felons lose but can regain their civil rights and can gain the removal of firearms disabilities. See Wis. Stat. \u00a7 6.03(1)(b) (Supp.2006); Wis. Const., Art. XIII, \u00a73(2); Wis. Stat. \u00a7 756.02 (2001); \u00a7 973.176(1) (2007). Persons convicted of misdemeanors, however, even if they are repeat offenders, generally retain their civil rights and are not subject to firearms disabilities.</p>\n<p>With this background in view, we turn to the proper interpretation of the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption from ACCA-enhanced sentencing for offenders who have had their \"civil rights restored.\" Logan's misdemeanor convictions, we reiterate, did not result in any loss of the rights to vote, hold public office, or serve on juries. Should he nonetheless be ranked with offenders whose rights were terminated but <span class=\"star-pagination\">*482</span> later restored? The ordinary meaning of the word \"restored\" affords Logan no aid. In line with dictionary definitions,<sup>[3]</sup> the Court of Appeals stated: \"The word `restore' means to give back something that had been taken away.\" 453 F.3d, at 805. Accord <i>McGrath,</i> 60 F.3d, at 1007 (\"The `restoration' of a thing never lost or diminished is a definitional impossibility.\"); cf. <i>Indelicato,</i> 97 F.3d, at 629 (\"Clearly the ordinary reading of the word `restored' supports the government.\").</p>\n<p>The context in which the word \"restored\" appears in \u00a7 921(a)(20) counsels adherence to the word's ordinary meaning. Words in a list are generally known by the company they keep. <i>E.g., </i><i>Dole v. Steelworkers,</i> 494 U.S. 26, 36, 110 S.Ct. 929, 108 L.Ed.2d 23 (1990); <i>Beecham v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 368, 371, 114 S.Ct. 1669, 128 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). In \u00a7 921(a)(20), the words \"civil rights restored\" appear in the company of the words \"expunged,\" \"set aside,\" and \"pardoned.\" Each term describes a measure by which the government relieves an offender of some or all of the consequences of his conviction. In contrast, a defendant who retains rights is simply left alone. He receives no status-altering dispensation, no token of forgiveness from the government.</p>\n<p>Opposing a plain-meaning approach to the language Congress enacted, Logan relies dominantly on the harsh results a literal reading could yield: Unless retention of rights is treated as legally equivalent to restoration of rights, less serious offenders will be subject to ACCA's enhanced penalties while more serious offenders in the same State, who have had civil rights restored, may escape heightened punishment. <i>E.g.,</i> Reply Brief 8 (\"[I]ndividuals who have committed more serious crimes than Petitioner may nonetheless have their rights restored, whereas misdemeanants who never lost their rights must suffer enhanced sentencing.\"). Logan urges that this result\u0097treating those who never lost their civil rights more harshly than those who lost, then regained, those rights\u0097is not merely anomalous; it rises to the level of the absurd, particularly in States where restoration of civil rights is automatic and occurs immediately upon release from prison. See <i>Caron,</i> 524 U.S., at 313, 118 S.Ct. 2007 (automatic restoration of rights qualifies for \u00a7 921(a)(20)'s exemption).</p>\n<p>Logan's argument, we note, overlooks \u00a7 921(a)(20)'s \"unless\" clause. Under that provision, an offender gains no exemption from ACCA's application through an expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights if the dispensation \"expressly provides that the [offender] may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\" Many States that restore felons' civil rights (or accord another measure of forgiveness) nonetheless impose or retain firearms disabilities. See Brief for United States 30 (citing, <i>inter alia,</i> La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14:95.1(C) (West Supp.2007), under which felons' firearms disabilities are lifted only after 10 years and only if no further felony convictions intervene).<sup>[4]</sup> We <span class=\"star-pagination\">*483</span> further note that Wisconsin has addressed, and prospectively eliminated, the anomaly Logan asserts he encountered: Wisconsin no longer punishes misdemeanors by more than two years of imprisonment, and thus no longer has any misdemeanors that qualify as ACCA predicates. See <i>supra,</i> at 480-481, n. 2.</p>\n<p>One can demur to Logan's argument that a literal reading of \u00a7 921(a)(20) could produce anomalous results, for the resolution he proposes\u0097reading into the exemption convictions under which civil rights are retained\u0097would correct one potential anomaly while creating others. See <i>McGrath,</i> 60 F.3d, at 1009. Under Logan's proposed construction, the most dangerous recidivists in a State that does not revoke any offender's civil rights could fall within \u00a7 921(a)(20)'s exemption. For example, Maine does not deprive any offenders of their civil rights. See Lodging for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> (NACDL Lodging), App. 1, pp. 23-24. As Logan would have us read \u00a7 921(a)(20), all Maine crimes, including first-degree murder, would be treated as crimes for which \"civil rights [have been] restored,\" while less serious crimes committed elsewhere would not.</p>\n<p>In <i>McGrath,</i> the Second Circuit incisively identified Congress' response to <i>Dickerson,</i> see <i>supra,</i> at 479-480, as the cause of the multiple anomalies \u00a7 921(a)(20) may produce:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Congress'] decision to have restoration triggered by events governed by state law insured anomalous results. The several states have considerably different laws governing pardon, expungement, and forfeiture and restoration of civil rights. Furthermore, states have drastically different policies as to when and under what circumstances such discretionary acts of grace should be extended.... [Anomalies generated by \u00a7 921(a)(20)] are the inevitable consequence of making access to the exemption depend on the differing laws and policies of the several states.\" 60 F.3d, at 1009.</blockquote>\n<p>Accord 453 F.3d, at 807 (\"When Congress replaced <i>Dickerso[n]</i> ... it ensured that similarly situated people would be treated differently\u0097for states vary widely in which if any civil rights a convict loses and whether these rights are restored.\"). See also M. Love, Relief from the Collateral Consequences of a Criminal Conviction: A State-by-State Resource Guide (2006), updated online at http://www.sentencing project.org/PublicationDetails.aspx? PublicationID=486 (as visited Nov. 27, 2007, and in Clerk of Court's case file) (surveying state practices).</p>\n<p>Were we to accept Logan's argument, it bears emphasis, we would undercut \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B), which places within ACCA's reach state misdemeanor convictions punishable by more than two years' imprisonment. Because state-law misdemeanors generally entail no revocation of civil rights,<sup>[5]</sup> Logan's proposed reading of the word \"restored\" to include \"retained\" would yield this curiosity: An offender would fall within ACCA's reach if his three prior offenses carried potential prison terms of over two years, but that same offender would be released from ACCA's grip by virtue of his retention of civil rights. We are disinclined to say that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*484</span> what Congress imposed with one hand (exposure to ACCA) it withdrew with the other (exemption from ACCA).</p>\n<p>We may assume, <i>arguendo,</i> that when Congress revised \u00a7 921(a)(20) in 1986, see <i>supra,</i> at 478, it labored under the misapprehension that all offenders\u0097misdemeanants as well as felons\u0097forfeit civil rights, at least temporarily. Even indulging the further assumption that courts may repair such a congressional oversight or mistake,<sup>[6]</sup> we could hardly divine the revision the Legislature would favor. Perhaps Congress would choose to exempt offenders who never lost their civil rights. See <i>McGrath,</i> 60 F.3d, at 1009. But it is also plausible that Congress would remove the exemption for civil rights restoration as insufficiently indicative of official forgiveness. Or, Congress might elect to include restorations of civil rights along with expungements, set asides, and pardons only if the restoration was nonautomatic, <i>i.e.,</i> granted on a case-by-case basis. Homing in on the disparities resulting from diverse state legislation, see <i>supra,</i> at 483, Congress might even revise \u00a7 921(a)(20) to provide, in accord with <i>Dickerson,</i> that federal rather than state law defines a conviction for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 922 and 924. See 453 F.3d, at 806-807.</p>\n<p>In all events, a measure adopted ten years after \u00a7 921(a)(20) was given its current shape cautions against any assumption that Congress did not mean to deny that exemption to offenders who retained their civil rights. In 1996, Congress enacted \u00a7 922(g)(9), which outlaws possession of a firearm by anyone \"who has been convicted... of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\" See Pub.L. 104-208, Tit. VI, \u00a7 658, 110 Stat. 3009-371 to 3009-372. Tailored to \u00a7 922(g)(9), Congress adopted a definitional provision, corresponding to \u00a7 921(a)(20), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A person shall not be considered to have been convicted of [a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence] if the conviction has been expunged or set aside, or is an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored <i>(if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under such an offense)</i> unless the pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) tracks \u00a7 921(a)(20) in specifying expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of rights as dispensations that can cancel lingering effects of a conviction. But the emphasized parenthetical qualification shows that the words \"civil rights restored\" do not cover a person whose civil rights were never taken away. See 453 F.3d, at 808. Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) casts considerable doubt on Logan's hypothesis that, had Congress adverted to the issue when it drafted \u00a7 921(a)(20), it would have placed in the same category persons who regained civil rights and persons who retained civil rights.</p>\n<p>Congress' enactment of \u00a7 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) is also relevant to Logan's absurdity argument. See <i>supra,</i> at 482. Statutory terms, we have held, may be interpreted against their literal meaning where the words \"could not conceivably have been intended to apply\" to the case at hand. <i>Cabell v. Markham,</i> 148 F.2d 737, 739(CA2) (L. Hand, J.), aff'd, 326 U.S. 404, 66 S.Ct. 193, 90 L.Ed. 165 (1945); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*485</span> see <i>Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co.,</i> 490 U.S. 504, 511, 109 S.Ct. 1981, 104 L.Ed.2d 557 (1989) (Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(1) \"can't mean what it says\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). In this case, it can hardly be maintained that Congress could not have meant what it said. Congress explicitly distinguished between \"restored\" and \"retained\" in \u00a7 921(a)(33)(B)(ii). It is more than \"conceivable\" that the Legislature, albeit an earlier one, see <i>supra,</i> at 477-478, meant to do the same in \u00a7 921(a)(20).</p>\n<p>In sum, Congress framed \u00a7 921(a)(20) to serve two purposes. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29. It sought to qualify as ACCA predicate offenses violent crimes that a State classifies as misdemeanors yet punishes by a substantial term of imprisonment, <i>i.e.,</i> more than two years. See \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B). Congress also sought to defer to a State's dispensation relieving an offender from disabling effects of a conviction. See <i>supra,</i> at 478. Had Congress included a retention-of-rights exemption, however, the very misdemeanors it meant to cover would escape ACCA's reach. See <i>supra,</i> at 483-484. Logan complains of an anomalous result. Yet the solution he proposes would also produce anomalies. See <i>supra,</i> at 483. Having no warrant to stray from \u00a7 921(a)(20)'s text, we hold that the words \"civil rights restored\" do not cover the case of an offender who lost no civil rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Firearms Owners' Protection Act, 100 Stat. 449, included a \"safety valve\" provision under which persons subject to federal firearms disabilities, including persons whose civil rights have not been restored, may apply to the Attorney General for relief from the disabilities. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The relief provision has been rendered inoperative, however, for Congress has repeatedly barred the Attorney General from using appropriated funds \"to investigate or act upon [relief] applications.\" <i>United States v. Bean,</i> 537 U.S. 71, 74-75, 123 S.Ct. 584, 154 L.Ed.2d 483 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). The bar on funding was renewed every year from 1992 through 2006. See <i>id.,</i> at 75, n. 3, 123 S.Ct. 584 (1992 through 2002); Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, 117 Stat. 433; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, 118 Stat. 53; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, 118 Stat. 2859; Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006, 119 Stat. 2290.</p>\n<p>[2]  Under Wisconsin law, misdemeanor battery is ordinarily punishable by a maximum term of nine months. See Wis. Stat. \u00a7 940.19(1) (2005); \u00a7 939.51(3). Logan was exposed to a three-year maximum term for each offense, however, because he was convicted as a \"repeater\" or \"habitual\" criminal. See App. 16-17; Wis. Stat. \u00a7 939.62 (1999-2000).\n</p>\n<p>Postdating Logan's battery convictions, Wisconsin prospectively reduced the maximum term for \"repeater\" misdemeanors to two years. See 2001 Wis. Act 109, \u00a7 562 (Jan.2002 special session) (amending Wis. Stat. \u00a7 939.62).

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 06\u20136911. Argued October 30, 2007\u2014Decided December 4, 2007\nUnder federal law, the maximum prison term for a felon convicted of\n possessing a firearm is ordinarily 10 years.           See 18 U. S. C.\n \u00a7924(a)(2). If the offender\u2019s prior criminal record includes at least\n three convictions for \u201cviolent felon[ies,]\u201d however, the Armed Career\n Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA) mandates a minimum term of 15 years.\n See \u00a7924(e)(1). Congress defined the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include\n specified crimes \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding\n one year,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B), but also provided that a state-law misde\n meanor may qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d if the offense is punishable\n by a term of more than two years, \u00a7921(a)(20)(B). Congress amended\n \u00a7921(a)(20) in 1986 to exclude from qualification for enhanced sen\n tencing \u201cany conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for\n which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights [i.e., rights\n to vote, hold office, and serve on a jury] restored.\u201d\n    Petitioner Logan pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a\n firearm and received a 15-year sentence, the mandatory minimum\n under ACCA. In imposing this sentence, the court took account of\n three Wisconsin misdemeanor battery convictions, each of them pun\n ishable by a 3-year maximum sentence, and none of them revoking\n any of Logan\u2019s civil rights. Logan challenged his sentence on the\n ground that his state-court convictions fell within \u00a7921(a)(20)\u2019s \u201ccivil\n rights restored\u201d exemption from ACCA\u2019s reach. Rights retained,\n Logan argued, should be treated the same as rights revoked but later\n restored. The District Court disagreed, holding that the exemption\n applies only to defendants whose civil rights were both lost and re\n stored, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The exemption contained in \u00a7921(a)(20) does not cover the case of\n an offender who retained civil rights at all times, and whose legal\n2                      LOGAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    status, postconviction, remained in all respects unaltered by any\n    state dispensation. Pp. 6\u201313.\n       (a) The ordinary meaning of the word \u201crestored\u201d\u2014giving back\n    something that has been taken away\u2014does not include retention of\n    something never lost. Moreover, the context in which \u201crestored\u201d ap\n    pears in \u00a7921(a)(20) counsels adherence to the word\u2019s ordinary mean\n    ing. In \u00a7921(a)(20), the words \u201ccivil rights restored\u201d appear in the\n    company of \u201cexpunged,\u201d \u201cset aside,\u201d and \u201cpardoned.\u201d Each of those\n    terms describes a measure by which the government relieves an of\n    fender of some or all of the consequences of his conviction. In con\n    trast, a defendant who retains rights is simply left alone. He receives\n    no status-altering dispensation, no token of forgiveness from the gov\n    ernment. Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) Logan\u2019s dominant argument against a plain-meaning approach\n    is not persuasive. He relies on the harsh result a literal reading\n    could yield: Unless retention of rights is treated as legally equivalent\n    to restoration of rights, he maintains, less serious offenders will be\n    subject to ACCA\u2019s enhanced penalties while more serious offenders in\n    the same State, who have had civil rights restored, may escape\n    heightened punishment. Logan urges that this result is not merely\n    anomalous; it is absurd, particularly in States where restoration of\n    civil rights occurs automatically upon release from prison. Pp. 7\u20138.\n       Logan\u2019s harsh or absurd consequences argument overlooks\n    \u00a7921(a)(20)\u2019s \u201cunless\u201d clause, under which an offender gains no ex\n    emption from ACCA\u2019s application through an expungement, set\n    aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights if the dispensation \u201cex\n    pressly provides that the [offender] may not ship, transport, possess,\n    or receive firearms.\u201d Many States that restore felons\u2019 civil rights (or\n    accord another measure of forgiveness) nonetheless impose or retain\n    firearms disabilities. Further, Wisconsin no longer punishes misde\n    meanors by more than two years\u2019 imprisonment, and thus no longer\n    has any misdemeanors that qualify as ACCA predicates. Pp. 8\u20139.\n       The resolution Logan proposes, in any event, would correct one po\n    tential anomaly while creating others. Under Logan\u2019s proposed con\n    struction, all crimes, including first-degree murder, would be treated\n    as crimes for which \u201ccivil rights [have been] restored\u201d in a State that\n    does not revoke any offender\u2019s civil rights, while less serious crimes\n    committed elsewhere would not. Accepting Logan\u2019s argument would\n    also undercut \u00a7921(a)(20)(B), which subjects to ACCA state misde\n    meanor convictions punishable by more than two years\u2019 imprison\n    ment. Because misdemeanors generally entail no revocation of civil\n    rights, reading the word \u201crestored\u201d to include \u201cretained\u201d would yield\n    this curiosity: An offender would fall within ACCA\u2019s reach if his three\n    prior offenses carried potential prison terms of over two years, but\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

This Court is disinclined to say that what Congress imposed\n  with one hand (exposure to ACCA) it withdrew with the other (ex\n  emption from ACCA). Even assuming that when Congress revised\n  \u00a7921(a)(20) in 1986, it labored under the misapprehension that all\n  misdemeanants and felons at least temporarily forfeit civil rights,\n  and indulging the further assumption that courts may repair such a\n  congressional oversight or mistake, this Court is not equipped to say\n  what statutory alteration, if any, Congress would have made had its\n  attention trained on offenders who retained civil rights; nor can the\n  Court recast \u00a7921(a)(20) in Congress\u2019 stead. Pp. 9\u201311.\n     Section 922(g)(9)\u2014which was adopted 10 years after \u00a7921(a)(20)\n  was given its current shape and which outlaws possession of a fire\n  arm by anyone \u201cconvicted . . . of a misdemeanor crime of domestic vio\n  lence\u201d\u2014cautions against any assumption that Congress did not mean\n  to deny the \u00a7921(a)(20) exemption to offenders who retained their\n  civil rights. Tailored to \u00a7922(g)(9), Congress adopted a definitional\n  provision, \u00a7921(a)(33)(B)(ii), corresponding to \u00a7921(a)(20), which\n  specifies expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of rights as\n  dispensations that can cancel lingering effects of a conviction. That\n  provision also demonstrates that the words \u201ccivil rights restored\u201d do\n  not cover a person whose civil rights were never taken away. It pro\n  vides for restoration of civil rights as a qualifying dispensation only\n  \u201cif the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil\n  rights\u201d in the first place. Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) also rebuts Logan\u2019s\n  absurdity argument. Statutory terms may be interpreted against\n  their literal meaning where the words could not conceivably have\n  been intended to apply to the case at hand. See, e.g., Green v. Bock\n  Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 511. In \u00a7921(a)(33)(B)(ii), how\n  ever, Congress explicitly distinguished between \u201crestored\u201d and \u201cre\n  tained,\u201d thereby making it more than conceivable that the Legisla\n  ture, albeit an earlier one, meant to do the same in \u00a7921(a)(20).\n  Pp. 11\u201313.\n453 F. 3d 804, affirmed.\n\n  GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                        Cite as: 552 U.

LOGAN, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [December 4, 2007] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Petitioner James D. Logan pleaded guilty in a United\nStates District Court to being a felon in possession of a\nfirearm, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1). Logan\u2019s\nrecord as a recidivist, which included three relevant state\nconvictions, led the District Court to impose a 15-year\nprison term, the minimum sentence mandated by the\nArmed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).       For ACCA sentence-\nenhancement purposes, a prior conviction may be disre\ngarded if the conviction \u201chas been expunged, or set aside,\u201d\nor the offender \u201chas been pardoned or has had civil rights\nrestored.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(20) (2000 ed.). None of Logan\u2019s prior\nconvictions have been expunged or set aside. Nor has he\nbeen pardoned for any past crime. And, bearing impor\ntantly on the instant petition, the three state-court convic\ntions that triggered Logan\u2019s ACCA-enhanced sentence\noccasioned no loss of civil rights.\n   Challenging his enhanced sentence, Logan presents this\nquestion: Does the \u201ccivil rights restored\u201d exemption con\ntained in \u00a7921(a)(20) encompass, and therefore remove\nfrom ACCA\u2019s reach, state-court convictions that at no time\n2                 LOGAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndeprived the offender of civil rights? We hold that the\n\u00a7921(a)(20) exemption provision does not cover the case of\nan offender who retained civil rights at all times, and\nwhose legal status, postconviction, remained in all re\nspects unaltered by any state dispensation.\n  Section 921(a)(20) sets out postconviction events\u2014\nexpungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil\nrights\u2014that extend to an offender a measure of forgive\nness, relieving him from some or all of the consequences of\nhis conviction.    Congress might have broadened the\n\u00a7921(a)(20) exemption provision to cover convictions at\ntended by no loss of civil rights. The national lawmakers,\nhowever, did not do so. Section 921(a)(20)\u2019s failure to\nexempt convictions that do not revoke civil rights produces\nanomalies. But so does the extension of the \u00a7921(a)(20)\nexemption that Logan advances. We are not equipped to\nsay what statutory alteration, if any, Congress would have\nmade had its attention trained on offenders who retained\ncivil rights; nor can we recast \u00a7921(a)(20) in Congress\u2019\nstead.\n                              I\n   Federal law generally prohibits the possession of a\nfirearm by a person convicted of \u201ca crime punishable by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7922(g)(1). Ordinarily, the maximum felon-in-possession\nsentence is 10 years. See \u00a7924(a)(2). If the offender\u2019s\nprior criminal record includes at least three convictions for\n\u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d or \u201cserious drug offense[s],\u201d however,\nthe maximum sentence increases to life, and ACCA man\ndates a minimum term of 15 years. \u00a7924(e)(1) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. V).\n   Congress defined the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include\nspecified crimes \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term\nexceeding one year.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.).

New Banner Institute, Inc., 460 U. S. 103\n(1983), we held that a State\u2019s expungement of a conviction\ndid not nullify the conviction for purposes of the firearms\ndisabilities Congress placed in \u00a7\u00a7922(g)(1) and (h)(1). In\nso ruling, we noted that our decision would ensure greater\nuniformity in federal sentences. See id., at 119\u2013120.\nProvisions for expungement \u201cvar[ied] widely from State to\nState,\u201d we observed, id., at 120, and yielded \u201cnothing less\nthan a national patchwork,\u201d id., at 122.\n   In the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act (FOPA), 100\nStat. 449 (1986), Congress amended \u00a7921(a)(20) in re\nsponse to Dickerson\u2019s holding that, for purposes of federal\nfirearms disabilities, state law did not determine the\npresent impact of a prior conviction. The amended provi\nsion excludes from qualification as a \u201ccrime punishable by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d (or a misde\nmeanor under state law punishable by more than two\nyears in prison):\n     \u201cAny conviction which has been expunged, or set aside\n     or for which a person has been pardoned or has had\n     civil rights restored . . . unless such pardon, expunge\n     ment, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides\n     that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or\n     receive firearms.\u201d 18 U.

See\n18 U. S. C. \u00a7925(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The relief provision has been\nrendered inoperative, however, for Congress has repeatedly barred the\nAttorney General from using appropriated funds \u201cto investigate or act\n4                   LOGAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nWhile \u00a7921(a)(20) does not define the term \u201ccivil rights,\u201d\ncourts have held, and petitioner agrees, that the civil\nrights relevant under the above-quoted provision are the\nrights to vote, hold office, and serve on a jury. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 13, n. 10; cf. Caron v. United States, 524\nU. S. 308, 316 (1998).\n                             II\n   On May 31, 2005, police officers responded to a domestic\ndisturbance complaint made by Logan\u2019s girlfriend,\nAsenath Wilson. App. 9, 12. Wilson told the officers,\namong other things, that she had seen Logan with a gun\nand that he usually kept it in the car. Ibid. Logan, who\nwas with Wilson when the police arrived, consented to a\nsearch of his car. Id., at 11. In a hidden compartment\nbehind the glove box, the officers found a 9-millimeter\nhandgun. Id., at 9\u201310, 12.\n   Logan pleaded guilty to the federal offense of possession\nof a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. Id.,\nat 12. (In 1991, he had been convicted in an Illinois court\nof unlawful possession of a controlled substance. Id., at 9\u2013\n10, 12.) The United States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of Wisconsin sentenced Logan to imprisonment for\n15 years, the mandatory minimum under ACCA. In im\nposing that enhanced sentence, the District Court took\naccount of Logan\u2019s three Wisconsin misdemeanor battery\nconvictions, each punishable by a maximum sentence of\nthree years\u2019 imprisonment. Id., at 16\u201318.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nupon [relief] applications.\u201d United States v. Bean, 537 U. S. 71, 74\u201375\n(2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).

S. ____ (2007)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Both in the District Court and on appeal, Logan argued\nthat his Wisconsin misdemeanor convictions did not qual\nify as ACCA predicate offenses because they caused no\nloss of his civil rights. Rights retained, he urged, are\nfunctionally equivalent to rights revoked but later re\nstored. If the exemption contained in \u00a7921(a)(20) covered\nthe three state-court misdemeanor convictions, Logan\u2019s\nmaximum sentence, in lieu of the 15-year mandatory\nminimum under ACCA, would have been 10 years, see\n\u00a7924(a)(2), and the United States Sentencing Guidelines\nwould have indicated a sentence range of 37 to 46 months,\nsee Brief for Petitioner 5. The District Court rejected\nLogan\u2019s argument, holding that the \u00a7921(a)(20) exemption\nprovision \u201capplies only to defendants whose civil rights\nwere both lost and restored pursuant to state statutes.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 11. Accordingly, the court sentenced\nLogan to imprisonment for 15 years. Id., at 12.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh\nCircuit affirmed, concluding that \u201can offender whose civil\nrights have been neither diminished nor returned is not a\nperson who \u2018has had civil rights restored.\u2019 \u201d 453 F. 3d 804,\n805 (2006). Logan\u2019s argument for treating retained rights\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nby a maximum term of nine months. See Wis. Stat. \u00a7940.19(1) (2005);\n\u00a7939.51(3). Logan was exposed to a three-year maximum term for each\noffense, however, because he was convicted as a \u201crepeater\u201d or \u201chabitual\u201d\ncriminal. See App. 16\u201317; Wis. Stat. \u00a7939.62 (1999\u20132000).\n  Postdating Logan\u2019s battery convictions, Wisconsin prospectively\nreduced the maximum term for \u201crepeater\u201d misdemeanors to two years.\nSee 2001 Wis. Act 109, \u00a7562 (Jan. 2002 special session) (amending Wis.\nStat. \u00a7939.62). Misdemeanors committed in Wisconsin after this\nreduction no longer qualify as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7921(a)(20).\n  Logan has never argued that his Wisconsin convictions should not\ncount as ACCA predicates because they were punishable by more than\ntwo years\u2019 imprisonment solely because of his status as a recidivist\noffender. We express no opinion on this matter. Cf. United States v.\nRodriguez, 464 F. 3d 1072 (CA9 2006), cert. granted, 551 U. S. ___\n(2007).\n6                LOGAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe same way as restored rights, the appeals court ob\nserved, \u201cgo[es] in the teeth of [\u00a7921(a)(20)\u2019s] text.\u201d Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari, 549 U. S. ___ (2007), to resolve a\nsplit among the Circuits as to whether \u00a7921(a)(20)\u2019s excep\ntion for \u201ccivil rights restored\u201d should be interpreted to\ninclude civil rights retained at all times. Compare 453\nF. 3d, at 809 (case below) (\u201ccivil rights restored\u201d does not\ninclude civil rights never revoked), and McGrath v. United\nStates, 60 F. 3d 1005 (CA2 1995) (same), with United\nStates v. Indelicato, 97 F. 3d 627, 631 (CA1 1996) (\u201ccivil\nrights restored\u201d includes civil rights never lost).\n                              III\n   Logan pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a\nfirearm, in violation of \u00a7922(g)(1), and received a manda\ntory minimum 15-year sentence because he had at least\nthree prior convictions for \u201cviolent felon[ies].\u201d \u00a7924(e)(1)\n(2000 ed., Supp. V). He acknowledges his convictions in\nWisconsin for three battery offenses that facially qualify\nas violent felonies under \u00a7921(a)(20)(B) (2000 ed.). See\nBrief for Petitioner 4\u20135. Thus the sole matter in dispute is\nwhether Logan fits within the exemption from an ACCA-\nenhanced sentence for convictions \u201cexpunged, or set aside\u201d\nor offenders who \u201cha[ve] been pardoned or ha[ve] had civil\nrights restored.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(20). None of Logan\u2019s battery\nconvictions have been expunged, set aside, or pardoned.\nSee 453 F. 3d, at 809. Under Wisconsin law, felons lose\nbut can regain their civil rights and can gain the removal\nof firearms disabilities. See Wis. Stat. \u00a76.03(1)(b) (Supp.\n2006); Wis. Const., Art. XIII, \u00a73(2); Wis. Stat. \u00a7756.02\n(2001); \u00a7973.176(1) (2007). Persons convicted of misde\nmeanors, however, even if they are repeat offenders, gen\nerally retain their civil rights and are not subject to fire\narms disabilities.\n   With this background in view, we turn to the proper\ninterpretation of the \u00a7921(a)(20) exemption from ACCA\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nenhanced sentencing for offenders who have had their\n\u201ccivil rights restored.\u201d Logan\u2019s misdemeanor convictions,\nwe reiterate, did not result in any loss of the rights to vote,\nhold public office, or serve on juries. Should he nonethe\nless be ranked with offenders whose rights were termi\nnated but later restored? The ordinary meaning of the\nword \u201crestored\u201d affords Logan no aid. In line with diction\nary definitions,3 the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cThe word\n\u2018restore\u2019 means to give back something that had been\ntaken away.\u201d 453 F. 3d, at 805. Accord McGrath, 60\nF. 3d, at 1007 (\u201cThe \u2018restoration\u2019 of a thing never lost or\ndiminished is a definitional impossibility.\u201d); cf. Indelicato,\n97 F. 3d, at 629 (\u201cClearly the ordinary reading of the word\n\u2018restored\u2019 supports the government.\u201d).\n   The context in which the word \u201crestored\u201d appears in\n\u00a7921(a)(20) counsels adherence to the word\u2019s ordinary\nmeaning. Words in a list are generally known by the\ncompany they keep. E.g., Dole v. Steelworkers, 494 U. S.\n26, 36 (1990); Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368,\n371 (1994). In \u00a7921(a)(20), the words \u201ccivil rights re\nstored\u201d appear in the company of the words \u201cexpunged,\u201d\n\u201cset aside,\u201d and \u201cpardoned.\u201d Each term describes a meas\nure by which the government relieves an offender of some\nor all of the consequences of his conviction. In contrast, a\ndefendant who retains rights is simply left alone. He\nreceives no status-altering dispensation, no token of for\ngiveness from the government.\n   Opposing a plain-meaning approach to the language\nCongress enacted, Logan relies dominantly on the harsh\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1936 (1993)\n\n(defining \u201crestore\u201d to mean \u201cgive back (as something lost or taken\naway)\u201d); American Heritage Dictionary 1486 (4th ed. 2000) (defining\n\u201crestore\u201d to mean \u201cbring back into existence or use; reestablish\u201d); 13\nOxford English Dictionary 755 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \u201crestore\u201d to mean\n\u201cgive back, [or] make return or restitution of (anything previously taken\naway or lost)\u201d).\n8                    LOGAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nresults a literal reading could yield: Unless retention of\nrights is treated as legally equivalent to restoration of\nrights, less serious offenders will be subject to ACCA\u2019s\nenhanced penalties while more serious offenders in the\nsame State, who have had civil rights restored, may es\ncape heightened punishment.           E.g., Reply Brief 8\n(\u201c[I]ndividuals who have committed more serious crimes\nthan Petitioner may nonetheless have their rights re\nstored, whereas misdemeanants who never lost their\nrights must suffer enhanced sentencing.\u201d). Logan urges\nthat this result\u2014treating those who never lost their civil\nrights more harshly than those who lost, then regained,\nthose rights\u2014is not merely anomalous; it rises to the level\nof the absurd, particularly in States where restoration of\ncivil rights is automatic and occurs immediately upon\nrelease from prison. See Caron, 524 U. S., at 313 (auto\nmatic restoration of rights qualifies for \u00a7921(a)(20)\u2019s\nexemption).\n   Logan\u2019s argument, we note, overlooks \u00a7921(a)(20)\u2019s\n\u201cunless\u201d clause. Under that provision, an offender gains\nno exemption from ACCA\u2019s application through an ex\npungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights\nif the dispensation \u201cexpressly provides that the [offender]\nmay not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\u201d\nMany States that restore felons\u2019 civil rights (or accord\nanother measure of forgiveness) nonetheless impose or\nretain firearms disabilities. See Brief for United States 30\n(citing, inter alia, La. Stat. Ann. \u00a714:95.1(C) (West Supp.\n2007), under which felons\u2019 firearms disabilities are lifted\nonly after 10 years and only if no further felony convic\ntions intervene).4 We further note that Wisconsin has\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Courts have divided on the question whether \u00a7921(a)(20)\u2019s \u201cunless\u201d\n\nclause is triggered whenever state law provides for the continuation of\nfirearm proscriptions, or only when the State provides individual notice\nto the offender of the firearms disabilities. Compare, e.g., United States\nv. Cassidy, 899 F. 2d 543, 549 (CA6 1990) (courts must look to \u201cthe\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\naddressed, and prospectively eliminated, the anomaly\nLogan asserts he encountered: Wisconsin no longer pun\nishes misdemeanors by more than two years of imprison\nment, and thus no longer has any misdemeanors that\nqualify as ACCA predicates. See supra, at 4\u20135, n. 2.\n  One can demur to Logan\u2019s argument that a literal read\ning of \u00a7921(a)(20) could produce anomalous results, for the\nresolution he proposes\u2014reading into the exemption con\nvictions under which civil rights are retained\u2014would\ncorrect one potential anomaly while creating others. See\nMcGrath, 60 F. 3d, at 1009. Under Logan\u2019s proposed\nconstruction, the most dangerous recidivists in a State\nthat does not revoke any offender\u2019s civil rights could fall\nwithin \u00a7921(a)(20)\u2019s exemption. For example, Maine does\nnot deprive any offenders of their civil rights. See Lodging\nfor National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\net al. as Amici Curiae (NACDL Lodging), App. 1, pp. 23\u2013\n24. As Logan would have us read \u00a7921(a)(20), all Maine\ncrimes, including first-degree murder, would be treated as\ncrimes for which \u201ccivil rights [have been] restored,\u201d while\nless serious crimes committed elsewhere would not.\n  In McGrath, the Second Circuit incisively identified\nCongress\u2019 response to Dickerson, see supra, at 3, as the\ncause of the multiple anomalies \u00a7921(a)(20) may produce:\n     \u201c[Congress\u2019] decision to have restoration triggered by\n     events governed by state law insured anomalous re\n     sults. The several states have considerably different\n     laws governing pardon, expungement, and forfeiture\n     and restoration of civil rights. Furthermore, states\n     have drastically different policies as to when and un\n     der what circumstances such discretionary acts of\n     grace should be extended. . . .

Love, Relief from the Collat\neral Consequences of a Criminal Conviction: A State-by-\nState Resource Guide (2006), updated online at\nhttp://www.sentencingproject.org/PublicationDetails.aspx?\nPublicationID=486 (as visited Nov. 27, 2007, and in Clerk\nof Court\u2019s case file) (surveying state practices).\n   Were we to accept Logan\u2019s argument, it bears emphasis,\nwe would undercut \u00a7921(a)(20)(B), which places within\nACCA\u2019s reach state misdemeanor convictions punishable\nby more than two years\u2019 imprisonment. Because state-law\nmisdemeanors generally entail no revocation of civil\nrights,5 Logan\u2019s proposed reading of the word \u201crestored\u201d to\ninclude \u201cretained\u201d would yield this curiosity: An offender\nwould fall within ACCA\u2019s reach if his three prior offenses\ncarried potential prison terms of over two years, but that\nsame offender would be released from ACCA\u2019s grip by\nvirtue of his retention of civil rights. We are disinclined to\nsay that what Congress imposed with one hand (exposure\nto ACCA) it withdrew with the other (exemption from\nACCA).\n   We may assume, arguendo, that when Congress revised\n\u00a7921(a)(20) in 1986, see supra, at 3, it labored under the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 See NACDL Lodging, App. 1 (compiling state laws); id., at 17\u201334\n\n(indicating that Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, and\nNew Hampshire revoke no misdemeanant\u2019s civil rights, but provide for\npunishment of certain crimes they classify as misdemeanors by prison\nterms exceeding two years).\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

Perhaps Congress would choose to exempt offend\ners who never lost their civil rights. See McGrath, 60\nF. 3d, at 1009. But it is also plausible that Congress\nwould remove the exemption for civil rights restoration as\ninsufficiently indicative of official forgiveness. Or, Con\ngress might elect to include restorations of civil rights\nalong with expungements, set asides, and pardons only if\nthe restoration was nonautomatic, i.e., granted on a case-\nby-case basis. Homing in on the disparities resulting from\ndiverse state legislation, see supra, at 9\u201310, Congress\nmight even revise \u00a7921(a)(20) to provide, in accord with\nDickerson, that federal rather than state law defines a\nconviction for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7922 and 924. See 453 F. 3d,\nat 806\u2013807.\n  In all events, a measure adopted ten years after\n\u00a7921(a)(20) was given its current shape cautions against\nany assumption that Congress did not mean to deny that\nexemption to offenders who retained their civil rights. In\n1996, Congress enacted \u00a7922(g)(9), which outlaws posses\nsion of a firearm by anyone \u201cwho has been convicted . . . of\na misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d See Pub.\nL. 104\u2013208, Tit. VI, \u00a7658, 110 Stat. 3009\u2013371 to 3009\u2013372.\nTailored to \u00a7922(g)(9), Congress adopted a definitional\nprovision, corresponding to \u00a7921(a)(20), which reads:\n     \u201cA person shall not be considered to have been con\n     victed of [a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence] if\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 But  see Iselin v. United States, 270 U. S. 245, 251 (1926) (\u201cenlarge\nment of [a statute] by [a] court, so that what was omitted, presumably\nby inadvertence, may be included within its scope . . . transcends the\njudicial function\u201d).\n12                LOGAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     the conviction has been expunged or set aside, or is an\n     offense for which the person has been pardoned or has\n     had civil rights restored (if the law of the applicable\n     jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under\n     such an offense) unless the pardon, expungement, or\n     restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the\n     person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive\n     firearms.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7921(a)(33)(B)(ii) (emphasis\n     added).\n   Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) tracks \u00a7921(a)(20) in specifying\nexpungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of rights as\ndispensations that can cancel lingering effects of a convic\ntion. But the emphasized parenthetical qualification\nshows that the words \u201ccivil rights restored\u201d do not cover a\nperson whose civil rights were never taken away. See 453\nF. 3d, at 808. Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) casts considerable\ndoubt on Logan\u2019s hypothesis that, had Congress adverted\nto the issue when it drafted \u00a7921(a)(20), it would have\nplaced in the same category persons who regained civil\nrights and persons who retained civil rights.\n   Congress\u2019 enactment of \u00a7921(a)(33)(B)(ii) is also relevant\nto Logan\u2019s absurdity argument. See supra, at 7\u20138. Statu\ntory terms, we have held, may be interpreted against their\nliteral meaning where the words \u201ccould not conceivably\nhave been intended to apply\u201d to the case at hand. Cabell\nv. Markham, 148 F. 2d 737, 739 (CA2) (L. Hand, J.), aff\u2019d,\n326 U. S. 404 (1945); see Green v. Bock Laundry Machine\nCo., 490 U.

In this case, it can hardly be maintained\nthat Congress could not have meant what it said. Con\ngress explicitly distinguished between \u201crestored\u201d and\n\u201cretained\u201d in \u00a7921(a)(33)(B)(ii). It is more than \u201cconceiv\nable\u201d that the Legislature, albeit an earlier one, see supra,\nat 3, meant to do the same in \u00a7921(a)(20).\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In sum, Congress framed \u00a7921(a)(20) to serve two pur\nposes. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\u201329. It sought to qualify as\nACCA predicate offenses violent crimes that a State classi\nfies as misdemeanors yet punishes by a substantial term\nof imprisonment, i.e., more than two years.             See\n\u00a7921(a)(20)(B). Congress also sought to defer to a State\u2019s\ndispensation relieving an offender from disabling effects of\na conviction. See supra, at 3. Had Congress included a\nretention-of-rights exemption, however, the very misde\nmeanors it meant to cover would escape ACCA\u2019s reach.\nSee supra, at 10. Logan complains of an anomalous result.\nYet the solution he proposes would also produce anoma\nlies. See supra, at 9. Having no warrant to stray from\n\u00a7921(a)(20)\u2019s text, we hold that the words \u201ccivil rights\nrestored\u201d do not cover the case of an offender who lost no\ncivil rights.\n                       *    *      *\n For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Seventh Circuit is\n                                            Affirmed.\n",

Logan pleaded guilty in a United States District Court to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Logan's record as a recidivist, which included three relevant state convictions, led the District Court to impose a 15-year prison term, the minimum sentence mandated by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*479</span> Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). For ACCA sentence-enhancement purposes, a prior conviction may be disregarded if the conviction \"has been expunged, or set aside,\" or the offender \"has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored.\" \u00a7 921(a)(20) (2000 ed.). None of Logan's prior convictions have been expunged or set aside. Nor has he been pardoned for any past crime. And, bearing importantly on the instant petition, the three state-court convictions that triggered Logan's ACCA-enhanced sentence occasioned no loss of civil rights.</p>\n<p>Challenging his enhanced sentence, Logan presents this question: Does the \"civil rights restored\" exemption contained in \u00a7 921(a)(20) encompass, and therefore remove from ACCA's reach, state-court convictions that at no time deprived the offender of civil rights? We hold that the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption provision does not cover the case of an offender who retained civil rights at all times, and whose legal status, postconviction, remained in all respects unaltered by any state dispensation.</p>\n<p>Section 921(a)(20) sets out postconviction events\u0097expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights\u0097that extend to an offender a measure of forgiveness, relieving him from some or all of the consequences of his conviction. Congress might have broadened the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption provision to cover convictions attended by no loss of civil rights. The national lawmakers, however, did not do so. Section 921(a)(20)'s failure to exempt convictions that do not revoke civil rights produces anomalies. But so does the extension of the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption that Logan advances. We are not equipped to say what statutory alteration, if any, Congress would have made had its attention trained on offenders who retained civil rights; nor can we recast \u00a7 921(a)(20) in Congress' stead.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Federal law generally prohibits the possession of a firearm by a person convicted of \"a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Ordinarily, the maximum felon-in-possession sentence is 10 years. See \u00a7 924(a)(2). If the offender's prior criminal record includes at least three convictions for \"violent felon[ies]\" or \"serious drug offense[s],\" however, the maximum sentence increases to life, and ACCA mandates a minimum term of 15 years. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>Congress defined the term \"violent felony\" to include specified crimes \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.). An offense classified by a State as a misdemeanor, however, may qualify as a \"violent felony\" for ACCA-enhancement purposes (or as a predicate for a felon-in-possession conviction under \u00a7 922(g)) only if the offense is punishable by more than two years in prison. \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B).</p>\n<p>In <i>Dickerson v.

In so ruling, we noted that our decision would ensure greater uniformity in federal sentences. See <i>id.,</i> at 119-120, 103 S.Ct. 986.

The amended provision excludes from qualification as a \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" (or a misdemeanor under state law punishable by more than two years in prison):</p>\n<blockquote>\"Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored ... unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20).<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>While \u00a7 921(a)(20) does not define the term \"civil rights,\" courts have held, and petitioner agrees, that the civil rights relevant under the above-quoted provision are the rights to vote, hold office, and serve on a jury.

App. 9, 12. Wilson told the officers, among other things, that she had seen Logan with a gun and that he usually kept it in the car. <i>Ibid.</i> Logan, who was with Wilson when the police arrived, consented to a search of his car. <i>Id.,</i> at 11. In a hidden compartment behind the glove box, the officers found a 9-millimeter handgun. <i>Id.,</i> at 9-10, 12.</p>\n<p>Logan pleaded guilty to the federal offense of possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. <i>Id.,</i> at 12. (In 1991, he had been convicted in an Illinois court of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. <i>Id.,</i> at 9-10, 12.) The United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin sentenced Logan to imprisonment for 15 years, the mandatory minimum under ACCA. In imposing that enhanced sentence, the District Court took account of Logan's three Wisconsin misdemeanor battery convictions, each punishable by a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment. <i>Id.,</i> at 16-18.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Both in the District Court and on appeal, Logan argued that his Wisconsin <span class=\"star-pagination\">*481</span> misdemeanor convictions did not qualify as ACCA predicate offenses because they caused no loss of his civil rights. Rights retained, he urged, are functionally equivalent to rights revoked but later restored. If the exemption contained in \u00a7 921(a)(20) covered the three state-court misdemeanor convictions, Logan's maximum sentence, in lieu of the 15-year mandatory minimum under ACCA, would have been 10 years, see \u00a7 924(a)(2), and the United States Sentencing Guidelines would have indicated a sentence range of 37 to 46 months, see Brief for Petitioner 5. The District Court rejected Logan's argument, holding that the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption provision \"applies only to defendants whose civil rights were both lost and restored pursuant to state statutes.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. Accordingly, the court sentenced Logan to imprisonment for 15 years. <i>Id.,</i> at 12.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, concluding that \"an offender whose civil rights have been neither diminished nor returned is not a person who `has had civil rights restored.'\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794885\"><a href=\"/opinion/794885/united-states-v-james-d-logan/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 805 (2006). Logan's argument for treating retained rights the same way as restored rights, the appeals court observed, \"go[es] in the teeth of [\u00a7 921(a)(20)'s] text.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1251, 167 L.Ed.2d 72 (2007), to resolve a split among the Circuits as to whether \u00a7 921(a)(20)'s exception for \"civil rights restored\" should be interpreted to include civil rights retained at all times. Compare 453 F.3d, at 809 (case below) (\"civil rights restored\" does not include civil rights never revoked), and <i>McGrath v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"700445\"><a href=\"/opinion/700445/james-mcgrath-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span> (C.A.2 1995) (same), with <i>United States v.

He acknowledges his convictions in Wisconsin for three battery offenses that facially qualify as violent felonies under \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B) (2000 ed.). See Brief for Petitioner 4-5. Thus the sole matter in dispute is whether Logan fits within the exemption from an ACCA-enhanced sentence for convictions \"expunged, or set aside\" or offenders who \"ha[ve] been pardoned or ha[ve] had civil rights restored.\" \u00a7 921(a)(20). None of Logan's battery convictions have been expunged, set aside, or pardoned. See 453 F.3d, at 809. Under Wisconsin law, felons lose but can regain their civil rights and can gain the removal of firearms disabilities. See Wis. Stat. \u00a7 6.03(1)(b) (Supp.2006); Wis. Const., Art. XIII, \u00a73(2); Wis. Stat. \u00a7 756.02 (2001); \u00a7 973.176(1) (2007). Persons convicted of misdemeanors, however, even if they are repeat offenders, generally retain their civil rights and are not subject to firearms disabilities.</p>\n<p>With this background in view, we turn to the proper interpretation of the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption from ACCA-enhanced sentencing for offenders who have had their \"civil rights restored.\" Logan's misdemeanor convictions, we reiterate, did not result in any loss of the rights to vote, hold public office, or serve on juries. Should he nonetheless be ranked with offenders whose rights were terminated but <span class=\"star-pagination\">*482</span> later restored? The ordinary meaning of the word \"restored\" affords Logan no aid. In line with dictionary definitions,<sup>[3]</sup> the Court of Appeals stated: \"The word `restore' means to give back something that had been taken away.\" 453 F.3d, at 805. Accord <i>McGrath,</i> 60 F.3d, at 1007 (\"The `restoration' of a thing never lost or diminished is a definitional impossibility.\"); cf. <i>Indelicato,</i> 97 F.3d, at 629 (\"Clearly the ordinary reading of the word `restored' supports the government.\").</p>\n<p>The context in which the word \"restored\" appears in \u00a7 921(a)(20) counsels adherence to the word's ordinary meaning. Words in a list are generally known by the company they keep. <i>E.g., </i><i>Dole v. Steelworkers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112374\"><a href=\"/opinion/112374/dole-v-steelworkers/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 36, 110 S.Ct. 929, 108 L.Ed.2d 23 (1990); <i>Beecham v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087963/beecham-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 371, 114 S.Ct. 1669, 128 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). In \u00a7 921(a)(20), the words \"civil rights restored\" appear in the company of the words \"expunged,\" \"set aside,\" and \"pardoned.\" Each term describes a measure by which the government relieves an offender of some or all of the consequences of his conviction. In contrast, a defendant who retains rights is simply left alone. He receives no status-altering dispensation, no token of forgiveness from the government.</p>\n<p>Opposing a plain-meaning approach to the language Congress enacted, Logan relies dominantly on the harsh results a literal reading could yield: Unless retention of rights is treated as legally equivalent to restoration of rights, less serious offenders will be subject to ACCA's enhanced penalties while more serious offenders in the same State, who have had civil rights restored, may escape heightened punishment. <i>E.g.,</i> Reply Brief 8 (\"[I]ndividuals who have committed more serious crimes than Petitioner may nonetheless have their rights restored, whereas misdemeanants who never lost their rights must suffer enhanced sentencing.\"). Logan urges that this result\u0097treating those who never lost their civil rights more harshly than those who lost, then regained, those rights\u0097is not merely anomalous; it rises to the level of the absurd, particularly in States where restoration of civil rights is automatic and occurs immediately upon release from prison. See <i>Caron,</i> 524 U.S., at 313, 118 S.Ct. 2007 (automatic restoration of rights qualifies for \u00a7 921(a)(20)'s exemption).</p>\n<p>Logan's argument, we note, overlooks \u00a7 921(a)(20)'s \"unless\" clause. Under that provision, an offender gains no exemption from ACCA's application through an expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights if the dispensation \"expressly provides that the [offender] may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\" Many States that restore felons' civil rights (or accord another measure of forgiveness) nonetheless impose or retain firearms disabilities. See Brief for United States 30 (citing, <i>inter alia,</i> La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14:95.1(C) (West Supp.2007), under which felons' firearms disabilities are lifted only after 10 years and only if no further felony convictions intervene).<sup>[4]</sup> We <span class=\"star-pagination\">*483</span> further note that Wisconsin has addressed, and prospectively eliminated, the anomaly Logan asserts he encountered: Wisconsin no longer punishes misdemeanors by more than two years of imprisonment, and thus no longer has any misdemeanors that qualify as ACCA predicates. See <i>supra,</i> at 480-481, n. 2.</p>\n<p>One can demur to Logan's argument that a literal reading of \u00a7 921(a)(20) could produce anomalous results, for the resolution he proposes\u0097reading into the exemption convictions under which civil rights are retained\u0097would correct one potential anomaly while creating others. See <i>McGrath,</i> 60 F.3d, at 1009. Under Logan's proposed construction, the most dangerous recidivists in a State that does not revoke any offender's civil rights could fall within \u00a7 921(a)(20)'s exemption. For example, Maine does not deprive any offenders of their civil rights. See Lodging for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> (NACDL Lodging), App. 1, pp. 23-24. As Logan would have us read \u00a7 921(a)(20), all Maine crimes, including first-degree murder, would be treated as crimes for which \"civil rights [have been] restored,\" while less serious crimes committed elsewhere would not.</p>\n<p>In <i>McGrath,</i> the Second Circuit incisively identified Congress' response to <i>Dickerson,</i> see <i>supra,</i> at 479-480, as the cause of the multiple anomalies \u00a7 921(a)(20) may produce:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Congress'] decision to have restoration triggered by events governed by state law insured anomalous results. The several states have considerably different laws governing pardon, expungement, and forfeiture and restoration of civil rights. Furthermore, states have drastically different policies as to when and under what circumstances such discretionary acts of grace should be extended.... [Anomalies generated by \u00a7 921(a)(20)] are the inevitable consequence of making access to the exemption depend on the differing laws and policies of the several states.\" 60 F.3d, at 1009.</blockquote>\n<p>Accord 453 F.3d, at 807 (\"When Congress replaced <i>Dickerso[n]</i> ... it ensured that similarly situated people would be treated differently\u0097for states vary widely in which if any civil rights a convict loses and whether these rights are restored.\"). See also M. Love, Relief from the Collateral Consequences of a Criminal Conviction: A State-by-State Resource Guide (2006), updated online at http://www.sentencing project.org/PublicationDetails.aspx? PublicationID=486 (as visited Nov. 27, 2007, and in Clerk of Court's case file) (surveying state practices).</p>\n<p>Were we to accept Logan's argument, it bears emphasis, we would undercut \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B), which places within ACCA's reach state misdemeanor convictions punishable by more than two years' imprisonment. Because state-law misdemeanors generally entail no revocation of civil rights,<sup>[5]</sup> Logan's proposed reading of the word \"restored\" to include \"retained\" would yield this curiosity: An offender would fall within ACCA's reach if his three prior offenses carried potential prison terms of over two years, but that same offender would be released from ACCA's grip by virtue of his retention of civil rights. We are disinclined to say that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*484</span> what Congress imposed with one hand (exposure to ACCA) it withdrew with the other (exemption from ACCA).</p>\n<p>We may assume, <i>arguendo,</i> that when Congress revised \u00a7 921(a)(20) in 1986, see <i>supra,</i> at 478, it labored under the misapprehension that all offenders\u0097misdemeanants as well as felons\u0097forfeit civil rights, at least temporarily. Even indulging the further assumption that courts may repair such a congressional oversight or mistake,<sup>[6]</sup> we could hardly divine the revision the Legislature would favor. Perhaps Congress would choose to exempt offenders who never lost their civil rights. See <i>McGrath,</i> 60 F.3d, at 1009. But it is also plausible that Congress would remove the exemption for civil rights restoration as insufficiently indicative of official forgiveness. Or, Congress might elect to include restorations of civil rights along with expungements, set asides, and pardons only if the restoration was nonautomatic, <i>i.e.,</i> granted on a case-by-case basis. Homing in on the disparities resulting from diverse state legislation, see <i>supra,</i> at 483, Congress might even revise \u00a7 921(a)(20) to provide, in accord with <i>Dickerson,</i> that federal rather than state law defines a conviction for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 922 and 924. See 453 F.3d, at 806-807.</p>\n<p>In all events, a measure adopted ten years after \u00a7 921(a)(20) was given its current shape cautions against any assumption that Congress did not mean to deny that exemption to offenders who retained their civil rights. In 1996, Congress enacted \u00a7 922(g)(9), which outlaws possession of a firearm by anyone \"who has been convicted... of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\" See Pub.L. 104-208, Tit. VI, \u00a7 658, 110 Stat. 3009-371 to 3009-372. Tailored to \u00a7 922(g)(9), Congress adopted a definitional provision, corresponding to \u00a7 921(a)(20), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A person shall not be considered to have been convicted of [a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence] if the conviction has been expunged or set aside, or is an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored <i>(if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under such an offense)</i> unless the pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) tracks \u00a7 921(a)(20) in specifying expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of rights as dispensations that can cancel lingering effects of a conviction. But the emphasized parenthetical qualification shows that the words \"civil rights restored\" do not cover a person whose civil rights were never taken away. See 453 F.3d, at 808. Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) casts considerable doubt on Logan's hypothesis that, had Congress adverted to the issue when it drafted \u00a7 921(a)(20), it would have placed in the same category persons who regained civil rights and persons who retained civil rights.</p>\n<p>Congress' enactment of \u00a7 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) is also relevant to Logan's absurdity argument. See <i>supra,</i> at 482. Statutory terms, we have held, may be interpreted against their literal meaning where the words \"could not conceivably have been intended to apply\" to the case at hand. <i>Cabell v. Markham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1503769\"><a href=\"/opinion/1503769/cabell-v-markham/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span>, 739(CA2) (L.

In this case, it can hardly be maintained that Congress could not have meant what it said. Congress explicitly distinguished between \"restored\" and \"retained\" in \u00a7 921(a)(33)(B)(ii). It is more than \"conceivable\" that the Legislature, albeit an earlier one, see <i>supra,</i> at 477-478, meant to do the same in \u00a7 921(a)(20).</p>\n<p>In sum, Congress framed \u00a7 921(a)(20) to serve two purposes. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29. It sought to qualify as ACCA predicate offenses violent crimes that a State classifies as misdemeanors yet punishes by a substantial term of imprisonment, <i>i.e.,</i> more than two years. See \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B). Congress also sought to defer to a State's dispensation relieving an offender from disabling effects of a conviction. See <i>supra,</i> at 478. Had Congress included a retention-of-rights exemption, however, the very misdemeanors it meant to cover would escape ACCA's reach. See <i>supra,</i> at 483-484. Logan complains of an anomalous result. Yet the solution he proposes would also produce anomalies. See <i>supra,</i> at 483. Having no warrant to stray from \u00a7 921(a)(20)'s text, we hold that the words \"civil rights restored\" do not cover the case of an offender who lost no civil rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Firearms Owners' Protection Act, 100 Stat. 449, included a \"safety valve\" provision under which persons subject to federal firearms disabilities, including persons whose civil rights have not been restored, may apply to the Attorney General for relief from the disabilities. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The relief provision has been rendered inoperative, however, for Congress has repeatedly barred the Attorney General from using appropriated funds \"to investigate or act upon [relief] applications.\" <i>United States v.

See Wis. Stat. \u00a7 940.19(1) (2005); \u00a7 939.51(3). Logan was exposed to a three-year maximum term for each offense, however, because he was convicted as a \"repeater\" or \"habitual\" criminal. See App. 16-17; Wis. Stat. \u00a7 939.62 (1999-2000).\n</p>\n<p>Postdating Logan's battery convictions, Wisconsin prospectively reduced the maximum term for \"repeater\" misdemeanors to two years. See 2001 Wis. Act 109, \u00a7 562 (Jan.2002 special session) (amending Wis. Stat. \u00a7 939.62). Misdemeanors committed in Wisconsin after this reduction no longer qualify as \"violent felonies\" under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20).</p>\n<p>Logan has never argued that his Wisconsin convictions should not count as ACCA predicates because they were punishable by more than two years' imprisonment solely because of his status as a recidivist offender.
