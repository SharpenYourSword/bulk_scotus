ALLEN, Commissioner, Alabama Department of Corrections,<br>\r\nv.<br>\r\nDaniel SIEBERT.</h1></center>\r\n<center>No. 06-1680.</center>\r\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\r\n<center>November 5, 2007.</center>\r\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\r\n<p>Daniel Siebert was convicted and sentenced to death in the State of Alabama for the murder of Linda Jarman. Siebert's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the certificate of judgment issued on May 22, 1990. This Court denied certiorari on November 5, 1990. <i>Siebert v. Alabama,</i> 498 U.S. 963, 111 S.Ct. 398, 112 L.Ed.2d 408. On August 25, 1992, Siebert filed a petition for postconviction relief in Alabama state court. The state courts denied the petition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> as untimely, however, because it was filed approximately three months after the expiration of the then-applicable 2-year statute of limitations, 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2000-2001), which began to run from the date the certificate of judgment issued.<sup>[*]</sup> The Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari on September 15, 2000. Siebert did not seek review in this Court. On September 14, 2001, Siebert filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.</p>\r\n<p>The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) established a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The limitations period is tolled, however, while \"a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\" \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Because Siebert's direct appeal became final before AEDPA became effective, the 1-year limitations period began to run from April 24, 1996, AEDPA's effective date. See <i>Carey v. Saffold,</i> 536 U.S. 214, 217, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002). Thus, absent tolling, Siebert's federal habeas petition would be untimely by over four years.</p>\r\n<p>The District Court dismissed Siebert's habeas petition as untimely, reasoning that an application for state post-conviction relief is not \"properly filed\" if it was rejected by the state court on statute-of-limitations grounds. The Court of Appeals reversed, however, holding that Siebert's state postconviction petition was \"properly filed\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2), because the state time bar was not jurisdictional and the Alabama courts therefore had discretion in enforcing it. See <i>Siebert v. Campbell,</i> 334 F.3d 1018, 1030 (C.A.11 2003) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> The Court of Appeals accordingly remanded to the District Court to consider the merits of Siebert's petition.</p>\r\n<p>While Siebert's habeas petition was pending on remand in the District Court, we decided <i>Pace v. DiGuglielmo,</i> 544 U.S. 408, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005). In <i>Pace,</i> we held that a state postconviction petition rejected by the state court as untimely is not \"properly filed\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <i>Id.,</i> at 414, 417, 125 S.Ct. 1807. Relying on <i>Pace,</i> the District Court again found that Siebert's state postconviction petition was not \"properly filed,\" and dismissed his federal habeas petition as untimely. The Court of Appeals, however, reversed and remanded. In a one-paragraph opinion, the court distinguished <i>Pace</i> on the ground that Rule 32.2(c), unlike the statute of limitations at issue in <i>Pace,</i> \"operate[s] as an affirmative defense.\" 480 F.3d 1089, 1090 (C.A.11 2007). Thus, the court found its prior holding\u0097that Siebert's state postconviction petition was \"properly filed\" because the state court rejected it on a nonjurisdictional ground\u0097stood as the law of the case. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>The Court of Appeals' carve-out of time limits that operate as affirmative defenses is inconsistent with our holding in <i>Pace.</i> Although the Pennsylvania statute of limitations at issue in <i>Pace</i> happens to have been a jurisdictional time bar under state law, see <i>Commonwealth v. Banks,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> 556 Pa. 1, 5-6, 726 A.2d 374, 376 (1999), the jurisdictional nature of the time limit was not the basis for our decision. Rather, we built upon a distinction that we had earlier articulated in <i>Artuz v. Bennett,</i> 531 U.S. 4, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000), between postconviction petitions rejected on the basis of \"`filing' conditions,\" which are not \"properly filed\" under \u00a7 2244(d)(2), and those rejected on the basis of \"procedural bars [that] go to the ability to obtain relief,\" which are. <i>Pace, supra,</i> at 417, 125 S.Ct. 1807 (citing <i>Artuz, supra,</i> at 10-11, 121 S.Ct. 361). We found that statutes of limitations are \"filing\" conditions because they \"go to the very initiation of a petition and a court's ability to consider that petition.\" <i>Pace,</i> 544 U.S., at 417, 125 S.Ct. 1807. Thus, we held \"that time limits, <i>no matter their form,</i> are `filing' conditions,\" and that a state post-conviction petition is therefore not \"properly filed\" if it was rejected by the state court as untimely. <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\r\n<p>In short, our holding in <i>Pace</i> turned not on the nature of the particular time limit relied upon by the state court, but rather on the fact that time limits generally establish \"conditions to filing\" a petition for state postconviction relief. Whether a time limit is jurisdictional, an affirmative defense, or something in between, it is a \"condition to filing,\" <i>Artuz, supra,</i> at 9, 121 S.Ct. 361\u0097it places a limit on how long a prisoner can wait before filing a postconviction petition. The fact that Alabama's Rule 32.2(c) is an affirmative defense that can be waived (or is subject to equitable tolling) renders it no less a \"filing\" requirement than a jurisdictional time bar would be; it only makes it a less stringent one. Indeed, in <i>Pace</i> we cited the very statute at issue in this case as an example of such a \"filing\" requirement. See 544 U.S., at 417, n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 1807 (citing 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2004-2005)).</p>\r\n<p>Excluding from <i>Pace's</i> scope those time limits that operate as affirmative defenses would leave a gaping hole in what we plainly meant to be a general rule, as statutes of limitations are often affirmative defenses. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c); <i>Kirkland v. State,</i> 143 Idaho 544, 546, 149 P.3d 819, 821 (2006) (\"The statute of limitations for petitions for post-conviction relief is not jurisdictional. It `is an affirmative defense that may be waived if it is not pleaded by the defendant'\" (quoting <i>Cole v. State,</i> 135 Idaho 107, 110, 15 P.3d 820, 823 (2000); citation omitted)); <i>People v. Boclair,</i> 202 Ill.2d 89, 101, 273 Ill.Dec. 560, 789 N.E.2d 734, 742 (2002) (holding that time bar for filing postconviction petition is \"an affirmative defense and can be raised, waived, or forfeited, by the State\"). What is more, whether a time limit is jurisdictional or an affirmative defense is often a disputed question, as the interpretive history of Rule 32.2(c) itself illustrates, see <i>Ex parte Ward,</i> No. 1051818, 2007 WL 1576054, *6 (Ala., June 1, 2007) (noting confusion in the Alabama lower courts over whether Rule 32.2(c) is jurisdictional). Under the Court of Appeals' approach, federal habeas courts would have to delve into the intricacies of state procedural law in deciding whether a postconviction petition rejected by the state courts as untimely was nonetheless \"properly filed\" under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Our decision in <i>Pace</i> precludes such an approach.</p>\r\n<p>We therefore reiterate now what we held in <i>Pace</i>: \"When a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, `that [is] the end of the matter' for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\" 544 U.S., at 414, 125 S.Ct. 1807 (quoting <i>Carey,</i> 536 U.S., at 226, 122 S.Ct. 2134; alteration in original). Because Siebert's petition for state postconviction relief was rejected as untimely by the Alabama courts, it was not \"properly filed\" under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Accordingly, he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> was not entitled to tolling of AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations.</p>\r\n<p>The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\r\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\r\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, dissenting.</p>\r\n<p>There is an obvious distinction between time limits that go to the very initiation of a petition, and time limits that create an affirmative defense that can be waived. Compare the majority and dissenting opinions in <i>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States,</i> 457 F.3d 1345 (C.A.Fed. 2006), cert. granted, 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2877, 167 L.Ed.2d 1151 (2007). The time limit under consideration in <i>Pace v. DiGuglielmo,</i> 544 U.S. 408, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005), was of the former kind\u0097as the Court's opinion expressly noted. See <i>id.,</i> at 417, 125 S.Ct. 1807 (discussing \"time limits, which go to the very initiation of a petition and a court's ability to consider that petition\"). The time limit at issue in this case is of the latter, distinguishable kind\u0097as the Court of Appeals correctly stated. 480 F.3d 1089, 1090 (C.A.11 2007) (holding that <i>Pace</i> did not address statutory tolling for \"a statute of limitations that operated as an affirmative defense\").</p>\r\n<p>It is true that there is language in the majority opinion in <i>Pace</i> that is broad enough to cover both kinds of limitations provisions, but only the former (those that do not operate as affirmative defenses) can even arguably provide a reasonable basis for concluding that an untimely petition has not been \"properly filed\" within the meaning of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214 (AEDPA).<sup>[*]</sup> I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\r\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\r\n<p>[*]  At the time Siebert's petition was before the Alabama courts, Rule 32.2(c) provided that \"the court shall not entertain any petition,\" with certain exceptions not applicable here, \"unless the petition is filed ... within two (2) years after the issuance of the certificate of judgment by the Court of Criminal Appeals.\" The rule has since been amended to provide for a 1-year limitations period, but is otherwise unchanged. See 1 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2007-2008).</p>\r\n<p>[*]  I continue to believe, as stated in my dissent in <i>Pace,</i> 544 U.S., at 427, 125 S.Ct. 1807, that state timeliness bars that operate like procedural bars (for example, those that require the courts to consider enumerated exceptions) should not determine whether a state postconviction petition is \"properly filed\" under AEDPA. Even accepting <i>Pace,</i> however, this case is distinguishable and should not be summarily reversed.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>",

Siebert did not\r\nseek review in this Court. On September 14, 2001, Siebert\r\nfiled a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, see 28\r\nU. S.

Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2007\u20132008).\r\n2                     ALLEN v. SIEBERT\r\n\r\n                          Per Curiam\r\n\r\n1996 (AEDPA) established a 1-year statute of limitations\r\nfor filing a federal habeas petition. \u00a72244(d)(1). The\r\nlimitations period is tolled, however, while \u201ca properly\r\nfiled application for State post-conviction or other collat\r\neral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or\r\nclaim is pending.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(2). Because Siebert\u2019s direct\r\nappeal became final before AEDPA became effective, the\r\n1-year limitations period began to run from April 24, 1996,\r\nAEDPA\u2019s effective date. See Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S.\r\n214, 217 (2002). Thus, absent tolling, Siebert\u2019s federal\r\nhabeas petition would be untimely by over four years.\r\n   The District Court dismissed Siebert\u2019s habeas petition\r\nas untimely, reasoning that an application for state post-\r\nconviction relief is not \u201cproperly filed\u201d if it was rejected by\r\nthe state court on statute-of-limitations grounds. The\r\nCourt of Appeals reversed, however, holding that Siebert\u2019s\r\nstate postconviction petition was \u201cproperly filed\u201d within\r\nthe meaning of \u00a72244(d)(2), because the state time bar was\r\nnot jurisdictional and the Alabama courts therefore had\r\ndiscretion in enforcing it. See Siebert v. Campbell, 334\r\nF. 3d 1018, 1030 (CA11 2003) (per curiam). The Court of\r\nAppeals accordingly remanded to the District Court to\r\nconsider the merits of Siebert\u2019s petition.\r\n   While Siebert\u2019s habeas petition was pending on remand\r\nin the District Court, we decided Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544\r\nU. S. 408 (2005). In Pace, we held that a state postconvic\r\ntion petition rejected by the state court as untimely is not\r\n\u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a72244(d)(2). Id., at\r\n414, 417. Relying on Pace, the District Court again found\r\nthat Siebert\u2019s state postconviction petition was not \u201cprop\r\nerly filed,\u201d and dismissed his federal habeas petition as\r\nuntimely. The Court of Appeals, however, reversed and\r\nremanded. In a one-paragraph opinion, the court distin\r\nguished Pace on the ground that Rule 32.2(c), unlike the\r\nstatute of limitations at issue in Pace, \u201coperate[s] as an\r\naffirmative defense.\u201d 480 F. 3d 1089, 1090 (CA11 2007).\r\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)             3\r\n\r\n                           Per Curiam\r\n\r\nThus, the court found its prior holding\u2014that Siebert\u2019s\r\nstate postconviction petition was \u201cproperly filed\u201d because\r\nthe state court rejected it on a nonjurisdictional ground\u2014\r\nstood as the law of the case. Ibid.\r\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 carve-out of time limits that\r\noperate as affirmative defenses is inconsistent with our\r\nholding in Pace. Although the Pennsylvania statute of\r\nlimitations at issue in Pace happens to have been a juris\r\ndictional time bar under state law, see Commonwealth v.\r\nBanks, 556 Pa. 1, 5\u20136, 726 A. 2d 374, 376 (1999), the\r\njurisdictional nature of the time limit was not the basis for\r\nour decision. Rather, we built upon a distinction that we\r\nhad earlier articulated in Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4\r\n(2000), between postconviction petitions rejected on the\r\nbasis of \u201c \u2018filing\u2019 conditions,\u201d which are not \u201cproperly filed\u201d\r\nunder \u00a72244(d)(2), and those rejected on the basis of \u201cpro\r\ncedural bars [that] go to the ability to obtain relief,\u201d which\r\nare. Pace, supra, at 417 (citing Artuz, supra, at 10\u201311).\r\nWe found that statutes of limitations are \u201cfiling\u201d condi\r\ntions because they \u201cgo to the very initiation of a petition\r\nand a court\u2019s ability to consider that petition.\u201d Pace, 544\r\nU. S., at 417. Thus, we held \u201cthat time limits, no matter\r\ntheir form, are \u2018filing\u2019 conditions,\u201d and that a state post-\r\nconviction petition is therefore not \u201cproperly filed\u201d if it was\r\nrejected by the state court as untimely. Ibid. (emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n   In short, our holding in Pace turned not on the nature of\r\nthe particular time limit relied upon by the state court,\r\nbut rather on the fact that time limits generally establish\r\n\u201cconditions to filing\u201d a petition for state postconviction\r\nrelief. Whether a time limit is jurisdictional, an affirma\r\ntive defense, or something in between, it is a \u201ccondition to\r\nfiling,\u201d Artuz, supra, at 9\u2014it places a limit on how long a\r\nprisoner can wait before filing a postconviction petition.\r\nThe fact that Alabama\u2019s Rule 32.2(c) is an affirmative\r\ndefense that can be waived (or is subject to equitable\r\n4                     ALLEN v. SIEBERT\r\n\r\n                          Per Curiam\r\n\r\ntolling) renders it no less a \u201cfiling\u201d requirement than a\r\njurisdictional time bar would be; it only makes it a less\r\nstringent one. Indeed, in Pace we cited the very statute at\r\nissue in this case as an example of such a \u201cfiling\u201d require\r\nment. See 544 U. S., at 417, n. 7 (citing 2 Ala. Rule Crim.\r\nProc. 32.2(c) (2004\u20132005)).\r\n   Excluding from Pace\u2019s scope those time limits that\r\noperate as affirmative defenses would leave a gaping hole\r\nin what we plainly meant to be a general rule, as statutes\r\nof limitations are often affirmative defenses. See, e.g.,\r\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c); Kirkland v. State, 143 Idaho 544,\r\n546, 149 P. 3d 819, 821 (2006) (\u201cThe statute of limitations\r\nfor petitions for post-conviction relief is not jurisdictional.\r\nIt \u2018is an affirmative defense that may be waived if it is not\r\npleaded by the defendant\u2019 \u201d (quoting Cole v. State, 135\r\nIdaho 107, 110, 15 P. 3d 820, 823 (2000); citation omit\r\nted)); People v. Boclair, 202 Ill. 2d 89, 101, 789 N. E. 2d\r\n734, 742 (2002) (holding that time bar for filing postcon\r\nviction petition is \u201can affirmative defense and can be\r\nraised, waived, or forfeited, by the State\u201d). What is more,\r\nwhether a time limit is jurisdictional or an affirmative\r\ndefense is often a disputed question, as the interpretive\r\nhistory of Rule 32.2(c) itself illustrates, see Ex parte Ward,\r\nNo. 1051818, 2007 WL 1576054, *6 (Ala., June 1, 2007)\r\n(noting confusion in the Alabama lower courts over\r\nwhether Rule 32.2(c) is jurisdictional).

Our decision in Pace precludes such an ap\r\nproach.\r\n   We therefore reiterate now what we held in Pace: \u201cWhen\r\na postconviction petition is untimely under state law, \u2018that\r\n[is] the end of the matter\u2019 for purposes of \u00a72244(d)(2).\u201d 544\r\nU.

The time limit\r\nunder consideration in Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408\r\n(2005), was of the former kind\u2014as the Court\u2019s opinion\r\nexpressly noted. See id., at 417 (discussing \u201ctime limits,\r\nwhich go to the very initiation of a petition and a court\u2019s\r\nability to consider that petition\u201d). The time limit at issue\r\nin this case is of the latter, distinguishable kind\u2014as the\r\nCourt of Appeals correctly stated. 480 F. 3d 1089, 1090\r\n(CA11 2007) (holding that Pace did not address statutory\r\ntolling for \u201ca statute of limitations that operated as an\r\naffirmative defense\u201d).\r\n   It is true that there is language in the majority opinion\r\nin Pace that is broad enough to cover both kinds of limita\r\ntions provisions, but only the former (those that do not\r\noperate as affirmative defenses) can even arguably provide\r\na reasonable basis for concluding that an untimely petition\r\nhas not been \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of the\r\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110\r\n2                         ALLEN v.

Siebert's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the certificate of judgment issued on May 22, 1990. This Court denied certiorari on November 5, 1990. <i>Siebert v. Alabama,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></span>, 111 S.Ct. 398, 112 L.Ed.2d 408. On August 25, 1992, Siebert filed a petition for postconviction relief in Alabama state court. The state courts denied the petition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> as untimely, however, because it was filed approximately three months after the expiration of the then-applicable 2-year statute of limitations, 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2000-2001), which began to run from the date the certificate of judgment issued.<sup>[*]</sup> The Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari on September 15, 2000. Siebert did not seek review in this Court. On September 14, 2001, Siebert filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.</p>\r\n<p>The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) established a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The limitations period is tolled, however, while \"a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\" \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Because Siebert's direct appeal became final before AEDPA became effective, the 1-year limitations period began to run from April 24, 1996, AEDPA's effective date. See <i>Carey v. Saffold,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121154\"><a href=\"/opinion/121154/carey-v-saffold/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 217, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002). Thus, absent tolling, Siebert's federal habeas petition would be untimely by over four years.</p>\r\n<p>The District Court dismissed Siebert's habeas petition as untimely, reasoning that an application for state post-conviction relief is not \"properly filed\" if it was rejected by the state court on statute-of-limitations grounds. The Court of Appeals reversed, however, holding that Siebert's state postconviction petition was \"properly filed\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2), because the state time bar was not jurisdictional and the Alabama courts therefore had discretion in enforcing it. See <i>Siebert v. Campbell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76209\"><a href=\"/opinion/76209/daniel-siebert-v-donal-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>, 1030 (C.A.11 2003) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> The Court of Appeals accordingly remanded to the District Court to consider the merits of Siebert's petition.</p>\r\n<p>While Siebert's habeas petition was pending on remand in the District Court, we decided <i>Pace v. DiGuglielmo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142891\"><a href=\"/opinion/142891/pace-v-diguglielmo/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005). In <i>Pace,</i> we held that a state postconviction petition rejected by the state court as untimely is not \"properly filed\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <i>Id.,</i> at 414, 417, 125 S.Ct. 1807. Relying on <i>Pace,</i> the District Court again found that Siebert's state postconviction petition was not \"properly filed,\" and dismissed his federal habeas petition as untimely. The Court of Appeals, however, reversed and remanded. In a one-paragraph opinion, the court distinguished <i>Pace</i> on the ground that Rule 32.2(c), unlike the statute of limitations at issue in <i>Pace,</i> \"operate[s] as an affirmative defense.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1089</span></span>, 1090 (C.A.11 2007). Thus, the court found its prior holding\u0097that Siebert's state postconviction petition was \"properly filed\" because the state court rejected it on a nonjurisdictional ground\u0097stood as the law of the case. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>The Court of Appeals' carve-out of time limits that operate as affirmative defenses is inconsistent with our holding in <i>Pace.</i> Although the Pennsylvania statute of limitations at issue in <i>Pace</i> happens to have been a jurisdictional time bar under state law, see <i>Commonwealth v. Banks,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5-6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2192682\"><a href=\"/opinion/2192682/com-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 376 (1999), the jurisdictional nature of the time limit was not the basis for our decision. Rather, we built upon a distinction that we had earlier articulated in <i>Artuz v. Bennett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118389\"><a href=\"/opinion/118389/artuz-v-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000), between postconviction petitions rejected on the basis of \"`filing' conditions,\" which are not \"properly filed\" under \u00a7 2244(d)(2), and those rejected on the basis of \"procedural bars [that] go to the ability to obtain relief,\" which are. <i>Pace, supra,</i> at 417, 125 S.Ct. 1807 (citing <i>Artuz, supra,</i> at 10-11, 121 S.Ct. 361). We found that statutes of limitations are \"filing\" conditions because they \"go to the very initiation of a petition and a court's ability to consider that petition.\" <i>Pace,</i> 544 U.S., at 417, 125 S.Ct. 1807. Thus, we held \"that time limits, <i>no matter their form,</i> are `filing' conditions,\" and that a state post-conviction petition is therefore not \"properly filed\" if it was rejected by the state court as untimely. <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\r\n<p>In short, our holding in <i>Pace</i> turned not on the nature of the particular time limit relied upon by the state court, but rather on the fact that time limits generally establish \"conditions to filing\" a petition for state postconviction relief. Whether a time limit is jurisdictional, an affirmative defense, or something in between, it is a \"condition to filing,\" <i>Artuz, supra,</i> at 9, 121 S.Ct. 361\u0097it places a limit on how long a prisoner can wait before filing a postconviction petition. The fact that Alabama's Rule 32.2(c) is an affirmative defense that can be waived (or is subject to equitable tolling) renders it no less a \"filing\" requirement than a jurisdictional time bar would be; it only makes it a less stringent one. Indeed, in <i>Pace</i> we cited the very statute at issue in this case as an example of such a \"filing\" requirement. See 544 U.S., at 417, n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 1807 (citing 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2004-2005)).</p>\r\n<p>Excluding from <i>Pace's</i> scope those time limits that operate as affirmative defenses would leave a gaping hole in what we plainly meant to be a general rule, as statutes of limitations are often affirmative defenses. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c); <i>Kirkland v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1694273\"><a href=\"/opinion/1694273/kirkland-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 546, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2565721\"><a href=\"/opinion/2565721/kirkland-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span>, 821 (2006) (\"The statute of limitations for petitions for post-conviction relief is not jurisdictional. It `is an affirmative defense that may be waived if it is not pleaded by the defendant'\" (quoting <i>Cole v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585663\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585663/cole-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 110, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585663\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585663/cole-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span>, 823 (2000); citation omitted)); <i>People v. Boclair,</i> 202 Ill.2d 89, 101, 273 Ill.Dec. 560, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2200841\"><a href=\"/opinion/2200841/people-v-boclair/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span>, 742 (2002) (holding that time bar for filing postconviction petition is \"an affirmative defense and can be raised, waived, or forfeited, by the State\"). What is more, whether a time limit is jurisdictional or an affirmative defense is often a disputed question, as the interpretive history of Rule 32.2(c) itself illustrates, see <i>Ex parte Ward,</i> No. 1051818, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2535006\"><a href=\"/opinion/2535006/ex-parte-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1576054</span></a></span>, *6 (Ala., June 1, 2007) (noting confusion in the Alabama lower courts over whether Rule 32.2(c) is jurisdictional). Under the Court of Appeals' approach, federal habeas courts would have to delve into the intricacies of state procedural law in deciding whether a postconviction petition rejected by the state courts as untimely was nonetheless \"properly filed\" under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Our decision in <i>Pace</i> precludes such an approach.</p>\r\n<p>We therefore reiterate now what we held in <i>Pace</i>: \"When a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, `that [is] the end of the matter' for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\" 544 U.S., at 414, 125 S.Ct. 1807 (quoting <i>Carey,</i> 536 U.S., at 226, 122 S.Ct. 2134; alteration in original). Because Siebert's petition for state postconviction relief was rejected as untimely by the Alabama courts, it was not \"properly filed\" under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Accordingly, he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> was not entitled to tolling of AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations.</p>\r\n<p>The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\r\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\r\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, dissenting.</p>\r\n<p>There is an obvious distinction between time limits that go to the very initiation of a petition, and time limits that create an affirmative defense that can be waived. Compare the majority and dissenting opinions in <i>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1345</span></span> (C.A.Fed. 2006), cert. granted, 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2877, 167 L.Ed.2d 1151 (2007).
