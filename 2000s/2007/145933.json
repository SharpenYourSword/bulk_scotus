S.\n___ (2007), and they now bring two requests: first, a 122\nday extension of time in which to file a petition for rehear\ning of the order denying certiorari, and second, suspension\nof the order denying certiorari. Both applications are\ndenied.\n    1. This Court’s Rules expressly provide for extensions of\ntime in which to file a petition for writ of certiorari, Rule\n13.5, or a petition for rehearing of a “judgment or decision\n. . . on the merits,” Rule 44.1, but they do not provide for\nany extension of time in which to file a petition for rehear\ning of an order denying certiorari. Such an order is plainly\nnot a “judgment or decision . . . on the merits.” Indeed,\nwhile Rule 44.1 establishes a 25-day period for filing a\npetition for rehearing of a judgment on the merits “unless\nthe Court or a Justice shortens or extends the time,” Rule\n2                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\n44.2, articulating a 25-day period for filing a petition for\nrehearing of an order denying certiorari, contains no such\nexception, confirming that the Rules do not contemplate\ngranting an extension for such petitions.\n   2. An order denying certiorari “will not be suspended\npending disposition of a petition for rehearing except by\norder of the Court or a Justice.” Rule 16.3. This most\nextraordinary relief will not be granted unless there is a\n“reasonable likelihood of this Court’s reversing its previ\nous position and granting certiorari.” Richmond v. Ari\nzona, 434 U. S. 1323 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers).\nIn arguing for suspension, applicants point to a motion\nfiled by the Government in the District Court as part of\nongoing proceedings below. They contend that, if the\nmotion is granted, or if certain other actions are taken by\nthe lower courts, there will be an adverse effect on the\nreview available to them under the Detainee Treatment\nAct of 2005, Tit. X, 119 Stat. 2739. This does not satisfy\nthe rigorous standard we have established for Rule 16.3\nrelief. Applicants do not even point to any action by the\nlower courts as prompting their request for extraordinary\nrelief—only the filing of motions and possible court action.\nSuch grounds can hardly provide a basis for believing this\nCourt would reverse course and grant certiorari. Accord\ningly, suspension of the order is not warranted.\n</pre>", "id": 145933, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2007/04/26/Boumediene_v._Bush_1.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 550 U.
