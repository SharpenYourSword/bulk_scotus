BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\n               STATES, ET AL.\n\n    KHALED A. F. AL ODAH, NEXT FRIEND OF FAWZI \n\n     KHALID ABDULLAH FAHAD AL ODAH, ET AL. \n\n06\u20131196                    v.\n                   UNITED STATES ET AL.\n  ON PETITIONS FOR WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n     STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF\n\n                   COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n          Nos. 06\u20131195 and 06\u20131196. Decided April 2, 2007 \n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, and\nwith whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins as to Part I, dissent\ning from the denial of certiorari.\n  I would grant the petitions for certiorari and expedite\nargument in these cases.\n                              I\n  Petitioners, foreign citizens imprisoned at Guantanamo\nBay, Cuba, raise an important question: whether the\nMilitary Commissions Act of 2006, Pub. L. 109\u2013366, 120\nStat. 2600, deprives courts of jurisdiction to consider their\nhabeas claims, and, if so, whether that deprivation is\nconstitutional. I believe these questions deserve this\nCourt\u2019s immediate attention.\n  First, the \u201cprovince\u201d of the Great Writ, \u201cshaped to guar\nantee the most fundamental of all rights, is to provide an\neffective and speedy instrument by which judicial inquiry\nmay be had into the legality of the detention of a person.\u201d\nCarafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234, 238 (1968) (emphasis\n2                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nadded and footnote omitted). Yet, petitioners have been\nheld for more than five years. They have not obtained\njudicial review of their habeas claims. If petitioners are\nright about the law, immediate review may avoid an addi\ntional year or more of imprisonment. If they are wrong,\nour review is nevertheless appropriate to help establish\nthe boundaries of the constitutional provision for the writ\nof habeas corpus. Cf. Carafas, supra. Finally, whether\npetitioners are right or wrong, our prompt review will\ndiminish the legal \u201cuncertainty\u201d that now \u201csurrounds\u201d the\napplication to Guantanamo detainees of this \u201cfundamental\nconstitutional principle.\u201d Brief for Senator Arlen Specter\nas Amicus Curiae 19; see generally ibid. (favoring expe\ndited consideration of these cases). Doing so will bring\nincreased clarity that in turn will speed review in other\ncases.\n   Second, petitioners plausibly argue that the lower\ncourt\u2019s reasoning is contrary to this Court\u2019s precedent.\nThis Court previously held that federal jurisdiction lay to\nconsider petitioners\u2019 habeas claims. Rasul v. Bush, 542\nU. S. 466, 485 (2004) (providing several of these petition\ners with the right to habeas review under law as it then\nstood). Our analysis proceeded under the then-operative\nstatute, but petitioners urge that our reasoning applies to\nthe scope of the constitutional habeas right as well. In\nholding that the writ extended to the petitioners in Rasul,\nwe said that Guantanamo was under the complete control\nand jurisdiction of the United States. Id., at 480\u2013481; id.,\nat 487 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cGuan\ntanamo Bay is in every practical respect a United States\nterritory\u201d). We then observed that the writ at common law\nwould have extended to petitioners:\n    \u201cApplication of the habeas statute to persons detained\n    at the base is consistent with the historical reach of\n    the writ of habeas corpus. At common law, courts ex\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    ercised habeas jurisdiction over the claims of aliens\n    detained within sovereign territory of the realm, as\n    well as the claims of persons detained in the so-called\n    exempt jurisdictions, where ordinary writs did not\n    run, and all other dominions under the sovereign\u2019s\n    control . . . . [E]ven if a territory was no part of the\n    realm, there was no doubt as to the court\u2019s power to\n    issue writs of habeas corpus if the territory was under\n    the subjection of the Crown.\u201d Id., at 481\u2013482 (internal\n    quotation marks and footnotes omitted).\nOur reasoning may be applicable here. The lower court\u2019s\nholding, petitioners urge, disregards these statements and\nreasoning.\n   Further, petitioners in Boumediene are natives of Alge\nria, and citizens of Bosnia, seized in Bosnia. Pet. for Cert.\nin No. 06\u20131195, p. 4. Other detainees, including several\npetitioners in Al Odah, also are citizens of friendly na\ntions, including Australia, Canada, Kuwait, Turkey, and\nthe United Kingdom; and many were seized outside of any\ntheater of hostility, in places like Pakistan, Thailand, and\nZambia. Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\u20131196, pp. 2\u20133, and n. 2;\n476 F. 3d 981, 1007 (CADC 2007) (Rogers, J., dissenting).\nIt is possible that these circumstances will make a differ\nence in respect to our resolution of the constitutional\nquestions presented. Cf. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S.\n507, 509, 514, 521 (2004) (plurality opinion of O\u2019Connor,\nJ., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and KENNEDY and BREYER,\nJJ.) (holding military had authority to detain United\nStates citizen \u201cenemy combatant,\u201d captured in a \u201czone of\nactive combat in a foreign theater of conflict,\u201d specifically\nAfghanistan, and stressing, in a \u201cnarrow\u201d holding, that\n\u201c[a]ctive combat operations against Taliban fighters . . .\n[were] ongoing in Afghanistan\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   The Government, of course, contests petitioners\u2019 argu\nments on the merits. But I do not here say petitioners are\n4                   BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncorrect; I say only that the questions presented are signifi\ncant ones warranting our review.\n   If petitioners have the right of access to habeas corpus\nin the federal courts, this Court would then have to con\nsider whether Congress\u2019 provision in the Detainee Treat\nment Act of 2005 (DTA), Tit. X, 119 Stat. 2739, providing\nfor review in the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit of\nthose proceedings, is a constitutionally adequate substi\ntute for habeas corpus. See Swain v. Pressley, 430 U. S.\n372, 381 (1977). The Government argues that we should\ntherefore wait for a case where, unlike petitioners here,\nthe detainee seeking certiorari has actually sought and\nreceived review under these alternative means. E.g., Brief\nin Opposition 16\u201317. Petitioners respond, however, that\nfurther proceedings in the Court of Appeals under the\nDTA could not possibly remedy a constitutional violation.\nThe lower court expressly indicated that no constitutional\nrights (not merely the right to habeas) extend to the Guan\ntanamo detainees. 476 F. 3d, at 991\u2013992 (rejecting peti\ntioners\u2019 arguments under this Court\u2019s precedent that\nfundamental rights afforded by the Constitution extend to\nGuantanamo, and noting that \u201c[p]recedent in this circuit\nalso forecloses the detainees\u2019 claims to constitutional\nrights\u201d). Therefore, it is irrelevant, to petitioners, that the\nDTA provides for review in the D. C. Circuit of any consti\ntutional infirmities in the proceedings under that Act,\n\u00a71005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 119 Stat. 2742; the lower court has\nalready rendered that provision a nullity.\n   Nor will further percolation of the question presented\noffer elucidation as to either the threshold question\nwhether petitioners have a right to habeas, or the question\nwhether the DTA provides a constitutionally adequate\nsubstitute. It is unreasonable to suggest that the D. C.\nCircuit in future proceedings under the DTA will provide\nreview that affords petitioners the rights that the Circuit\nhas already concluded they do not have. Ordinarily, ha\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

See Wilwording v.\nSwenson, 404 U. S. 249, 250 (1971) (per curiam).\n   The Government, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. ___\n(2006), similarly argued for delay. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n52) (\u201cThe Government objects to our consideration of any\nprocedural challenge at this stage on the grounds that . . .\n[petitioner] will be able to raise any such challenge follow\ning a \u2018final decision\u2019 under the DTA\u201d). That case, too,\npresented questions of the scope of the Guantanamo de\ntainees\u2019 right to federal-court review of DTA-authorized\nprocedures. We there rejected the Government\u2019s argu\nment for delay as unsound. Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 52\u2013\n53) (\u201c[C]ontrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, there is a\n\u2018basis to presume\u2019 that the procedures . . . violate the\nlaw . . . . Under these circumstances, review . . . in ad\nvance of a \u2018final decision\u2019 . . . is appropriate\u201d).\n   Here, as in Hamdan, petitioners argue that the tribu\nnals to which they have already been subjected were\ninfirm (by, inter alia, denying Petitioners counsel and\naccess to evidence, Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\u20131195, p. 7).\nHamdan, supra, at ___\u2013___ (slip op., 35\u201336). Here, as in\nHamdan, petitioners assert that these procedural infirmi\nties cannot be corrected by review under the DTA which\nprovides for no augmentation of the record on appeal and,\nas noted above, will provide no remedy for any constitu\ntional violation. See DTA \u00a71005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742;\n476 F. 3d, at 1005 (Rogers, J., dissenting). Here, as in\nHamdan, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 25), petitioners have a\ncompelling interest in assuring in advance that the proce\ndures to which they are subject are lawful. And here,\nunlike Hamdan, the military tribunals in Guantanamo\nhave completed their work; all that remains are the ap\npeals. For all these reasons, I would grant the petitions.\n6                  BOUMEDIENE v.

In the\npast, this Court has expedited other cases where impor\ntant issues and a need for speedy consideration were at\nstake. In Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), the Court\ndecided that it should grant expedited consideration,\n    \u201c[i]n view of the public importance of the questions\n    raised by [the] petitions and of the duty which rests\n    on the courts, in time of war as well as in time of\n    peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safe\n    guards of civil liberty, and because in our opinion the\n    public interest required that we consider and decide\n    those questions without any avoidable delay.\u201d Id., at\n    19.\nSee also Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651 (1996); New York\nTimes Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971) (per cu\nriam); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S.\n579 (1952).\n  For these reasons, I would grant the petitions for certio\nrari and the motions to expedite the cases in accordance\nwith the schedule deemed acceptable (in the alternative)\nby the Government.\n",

Here, as in\nHamdan, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 25), petitioners have a\ncompelling interest in assuring in advance that the proce\ndures to which they are subject are lawful. And here,\nunlike Hamdan, the military tribunals in Guantanamo\nhave completed their work; all that remains are the ap\npeals. For all these reasons, I would grant the petitions.\n6                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH \n\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n                             II \n\n  Moreover, I would expedite our consideration. In the\npast, this Court has expedited other cases where impor\ntant issues and a need for speedy consideration were at\nstake. In Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), the Court\ndecided that it should grant expedited consideration,\n    \u201c[i]n view of the public importance of the questions\n    raised by [the] petitions and of the duty which rests\n    on the courts, in time of war as well as in time of\n    peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safe\n    guards of civil liberty, and because in our opinion the\n    public interest required that we consider and decide\n    those questions without any avoidable delay.\u201d Id., at\n    19.\nSee also Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651 (1996); New York\nTimes Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971) (per cu\nriam); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S.\n579 (1952).\n  For these reasons, I would grant the petitions for certio\nrari and the motions to expedite the cases in accordance\nwith the schedule deemed acceptable (in the alternative)\nby the Government.\n</pre>",
