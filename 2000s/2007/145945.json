United States, 530 U. S. 428 (2000), we\nheld that the first sentence of 18 U. S. C. §3501(a) is un\nconstitutional. In this case the Court of Appeals affirmed\nthe District Court’s rejection of the petitioner’s request for\nan instruction relating to the voluntariness of her confes\nsion—an instruction that the third sentence of §3501(a)\nrequires. The Court of Appeals reasoned that Dickerson\nhad invalidated all of §3501 and not just the first sen\ntence. As the Solicitor General concedes, that holding was\nerroneous. While I am persuaded that the arguably harm\nless character of the trial judge’s error provides a proper\nreason for denying the petition for certiorari, I think it\nimportant to note that our denial does not endorse the\nincorrect reasoning in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.\n</pre>", "id": 145945, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2007/01/16/Joseph_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                  Cite as: 549 U.
