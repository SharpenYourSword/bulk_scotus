Decided January 16, 2007 \n\n\n   The motion of the United States for leave to intervene is\ngranted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted.\nThe judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for\nfurther consideration in light of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72403(a) to\nconsider the views of the United States.\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring.\n   I concur in the Court\u2019s order granting the petition for\ncertiorari, vacating the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment, and\nremanding for consideration of the United States\u2019 views in\nlight of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72403(a). The United States points out\nthat had the Sixth Circuit attended to United States v.\nGeorgia, 546 U. S. 151 (2006), it might not have reached\nthe question whether Title II of the Americans with Dis\nabilities Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 337, as amended, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a712131 et seq., abrogated the State of Ohio\u2019s Elev\nenth Amendment immunity with respect to petitioners\u2019\nclaims. That is so because the Court of Appeals also held\nthat petitioners failed to state a claim for relief against\nOhio under Title II. I write separately to note that two\naspects of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s alternative rulings are puz\nzling, calling into question the adequacy of those rulings to\nsupport the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.\n   First, petitioners alleged that Ohio discriminated\nagainst Rachel Haas by failing to ensure that she was\nhoused in a handicap accessible correctional facility. The\nCourt of Appeals held this claim barred by judicial immu\n2         HAAS v. QUEST RECOVERY SERVICES, INC.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., concurring\n\nnity, even though no judge was named a defendant in this\naction. The court cited no authority for according the\nbenefit of judicial immunity to defendants who are not\njudges.\n  Second, petitioners asserted, as a discrete basis for\nOhio\u2019s liability, the State\u2019s ownership of the building\nhousing the private correctional facility to which Haas was\nassigned. See Dept. of Justice, Civil Rights Division,\nDisability Rights Section, Americans with Disabilities Act:\nTitle II Technical Assistance Manual \u00a71.3000 (Nov. 1993)\n(explaining that a public entity may be liable as a land\nlord). The Sixth Circuit held that petitioners failed to\nsatisfy special \u201cpleading requirements\u201d set forth in John\nson v. Saline, 151 F. 3d 564 (1998), for alleging a claim\nagainst Ohio as a landlord. Under this Court\u2019s jurispru\ndence, however, federal courts ordinarily have no warrant\nto impose heightened pleading standards not prescribed\nby statute or rule. See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant\nCounty Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507\nU. S. 163, 168 (1993). Neither Johnson nor the decision at\nhand offers any justification for applying special pleading\nrules to Title II claims.\n  If, on remand, the Court of Appeals again holds that\npetitioners failed to state a claim under Title II, this Court\nwould benefit from a fuller statement of the reasons un\nderlying that decision. Further review here would also be\naided if, on remand, the Sixth Circuit clarified whether\nany aspect of Ohio\u2019s Title II liability was covered by the\nsettlement agreement the parties entered into while this\ncase was pending in the District Court. Ohio here con\ntends that, as part of that agreement, it has been released\nfrom Title II liability as a landlord. The Sixth Circuit\nstated only that the parties settled Ohio\u2019s liability as a\nlandlord under a different statute, the Rehabilitation Act,\nand petitioners do not concede that they have released\ntheir Title II landlord-liability claim.\n",
