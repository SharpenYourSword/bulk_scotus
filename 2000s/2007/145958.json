ARIZONA\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n                  COURT OF ARIZONA\n\n             No. 07–5847. Decided October 15, 2007 \n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   Joe Clarence Smith, petitioner in this case, was first\nsentenced to death 30 years ago. Due to constitutional\nerror, the Arizona courts in 1979 set this first sentencing\naside. Smith was again sentenced to death later that\nyear. Due to ineffective assistance of counsel, the federal\ncourts in 1999 set this second sentencing aside. Smith\nwas again sentenced to death in 2004. He now argues\nthat the Federal Constitution’s prohibition against cruel\nand unusual punishments forbids his execution more than\n30 years after he was initially convicted.\n   In my view, Smith can reasonably claim that his execu\ntion at this late date would be “unusual.” I am unaware of\nother executions that have taken place after so long a\ndelay, particularly when much of the delay at issue seems\ndue to constitutionally defective sentencing proceedings.\nAnd whether it is “cruel” to keep an individual for decades\non death row or otherwise under threat of imminent exe\ncution raises a serious constitutional question. I have\nelsewhere explained (in cases involving less lengthy de\nlays) why I believe that is so. See Foster v. Florida, 537\nU.
