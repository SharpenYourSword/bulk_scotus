KELLY, WARDEN \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 06\u201311622.   Decided October 1, 2007 \n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE\nGINSBURG joins, respecting the denial of certiorari.\n   The petition for certiorari seeking review of the Court of\nAppeals judgment upholding petitioner\u2019s death sentence\nwas filed on June 1, 2007, well in advance of its June 27\ndue date. Under our normal practice, that timely petition\nwould have been reviewed at our Conference on Septem\nber 24, 2007. Nevertheless, Virginia set an execution date\nof June 13, 2007, making it impossible for us to consider\nthe merits of the petition in the normal course, and mak\ning it necessary for the Court to rule on petitioner\u2019s last-\nminute application for a stay of execution. Although only\nfour Members of the Court voted to grant that application,\nthe Governor of Virginia, recognizing that basic fairness\ndemands that capital defendants be given the opportunity\nto complete the legal appeals process prior to execution,\ngranted petitioner a reprieve to afford us the opportunity\nto give the petition the careful consideration that it clearly\nmerited.\n   As the majority opinion filed by Judge Traxler and the\ndissenting opinion filed by Judge Gregory demonstrate,\nreasonable judges can and do disagree about the merits of\npetitioner\u2019s challenge to the adequacy of his counsel\u2019s\nrepresentation at the penalty phase of his trial. See 474\nF. 3d 154 (CA4 2007). Moreover, those opinions also make\nit clear that a thorough examination of the trial record, as\n2                     EMMETT v. KELLY\n\n                    Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\nwell as the evidence that he claims his lawyers should\nhave discovered, is essential for a correct appraisal of the\nmerits. Having conducted that review, I do not dissent\nfrom the Court\u2019s decision to deny certiorari. I do, however,\nremain firmly convinced that no State should be allowed\nto foreshorten this Court\u2019s orderly review of federal consti\ntutional claims of first-time habeas petitioners by execut\ning prisoners before that review can be completed.\n   Both the interest in avoiding irreversible error in capital\ncases, and the interest in the efficient management of our\ndocket, would be served by a routine practice of staying all\nexecutions scheduled in advance of the completion of our\nreview of the denial of a capital defendant\u2019s first applica\ntion for a federal writ of habeas corpus. Such a practice\nwould be faithful to the distinction between first and\nsuccessive habeas petitions recognized by Congress in the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA)\nand would accord death row inmates the same, rather\nthan lesser, procedural safeguards as ordinary litigants. It\nis a practice that JUSTICE GINSBURG and I have followed\nin the past and one that I hope a majority of the Court will\neventually endorse.\n",
