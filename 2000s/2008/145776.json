Contributions from individual donors during a 2-year election cycle are subject to a cap, which is currently set at $2,300. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2766</span> \u00a7\u00a7 441a(a)(1)(A), (c); 72 Fed.Reg. 5295 (2007). In addition, no funds may be accepted from an individual whose aggregate contributions to candidates and their committees during the election cycle have reached the legal limit, currently $42,700. See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 441a(a)(3)(A), (c); 72 Fed. Reg. 5295. A candidate also may not accept general election coordinated expenditures by national or state political party committees that exceed an imposed limit. See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 441a(c), (d). Currently, the limit for candidates in States with more than one House seat is $40,900. 72 Fed.Reg. 5294.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Section 319(a) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 116 Stat. 109, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a-1(a),<sup>[3]</sup> part of the so-called \"Millionaire's Amendment,\" fundamentally alters this scheme when, as a result of a candidate's expenditure of personal funds, the \"opposition personal funds amount\" (OPFA) exceeds $350,000.<sup>[4]</sup> The OPFA, in simple terms, is a statistic that compares the expenditure of personal funds by competing candidates and also takes into account to some degree certain other fundraising.<sup>[5]</sup> See \u00a7 441a-1(a). When a candidate's expenditure of personal funds causes the OPFA to pass the $350,000 mark (for convenience, such candidates will be referred to as \"self-financing\"), a new, asymmetrical regulatory scheme comes into play. The self-financing candidate remains subject to the limitations noted above, but the candidate's opponent (the \"non-self-financing\" candidate) may receive individual contributions at treble the normal limit <i>(e.g.,</i> $6,900 rather than the current $2,300), even from individuals who have reached the normal aggregate contributions cap, and may accept coordinated party expenditures without limit. See \u00a7\u00a7 441a-1(a)(1)(A)-(C). Once the non-self-financing candidate's receipts exceed the OPFA, the prior limits are revived. \u00a7 441a-1(a)(3). A candidate who does not spend the contributions received under the asymmetrical limits must return them. \u00a7 441a-1(a)(4).</p>\n<p>In order to calculate the OPFA, certain information is needed about the self-financing candidate's campaign assets and personal expenditures. Section 319(b) thus requires self-financing candidates to make three types of disclosures. First, within 15 days after entering a race, a candidate must file a \"[d]eclaration of intent\" revealing the amount of personal funds the candidate intends to spend in excess of $350,000. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a-1(b)(1)(B). A candidate who does not intend to cross this threshold may simply declare an intent to spend no personal funds. 11 CFR \u00a7 400.20(a)(2) (2008). Second, within 24 hours of crossing or becoming obligated to cross the $350,000 mark, the candidate must file an \"[i]nitial notification.\" 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a-1(b)(1)(C). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2767</span> Third, the candidate must file an \"[a]dditional notification\" within 24 hours of making or becoming obligated to make each additional expenditure of $10,000 or more using personal funds. \u00a7 441a-1(b)(1)(D). The initial and additional notifications must provide the date and amount of each expenditure from personal funds, and all notifications must be filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), all other candidates for the seat, and the national parties of all those candidates. \u00a7 441a-1(b)(1)(E). Failure to comply with the reporting requirements may result in civil and criminal penalties. \u00a7\u00a7 437g(a)(5)-(6), (d)(1).</p>\n<p>A non-self-financing candidate and the candidate's committee face less extensive disclosure requirements. Within 24 hours after receiving an \"initial\" or \"additional\" notification filed by a self-financing opponent, a non-self-financing candidate must provide notice to the FEC and the national and state committees of the candidate's party if the non-self-financing candidate concludes based on the newly acquired information that the OPFA has passed the $350,000 mark. 11 CFR \u00a7 400.30(b)(2). In addition, when the additional contributions that a non-self-financing candidate is authorized to receive pursuant to the asymmetrical limitations scheme equals the OPFA, the non-self-financing candidate must notify the FEC and the appropriate national and state committees within 24 hours. \u00a7 400.31(e)(1)(ii). The non-self-financing candidate must also provide notice regarding any refunds of \"excess funds\" (funds received under the increased limits but not used in the campaign). \u00a7\u00a7 400.50, 400.54. For their part, political parties must notify the FEC and the candidate they support within 24 hours of making any expenditures that exceed the normal limit for coordinated party expenditures. \u00a7 400.30(c)(2).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Appellant Jack Davis was the Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives from New York's 26th Congressional District in 2004 and 2006. In both elections, he lost to the incumbent. In his brief, Davis discloses having spent $1.2 million, principally his own funds, on his 2004 campaign. Brief for Appellant 4. He reports spending $2.3 million in 2006, all but $126,000 of which came from personal funds. <i>Id.,</i> at 13. His opponent in 2006 spent no personal funds. Indeed, although the OPFA calculation provided the opportunity for Davis' opponent to raise nearly $1.5 million under \u00a7 319(a)'s asymmetrical limits, Davis' opponent adhered to the normal contribution limits.</p>\n<p>Davis' 2006 candidacy began in March 2006, when he filed with the FEC a \"Statement of Candidacy\" and, in compliance with \u00a7 319(b), declared that he intended to spend $1 million in personal funds during the general election. Two months later, in anticipation of this expenditure and its \u00a7 319 consequences, Davis filed suit against the FEC, requesting that \u00a7 319 be declared unconstitutional and that the FEC be enjoined from enforcing it during the 2006 election.</p>\n<p>After Davis declared his candidacy but before he filed suit, the FEC's general counsel notified him that it had reason to believe that he had violated \u00a7 319 by failing to report personal expenditures during the 2004 campaign. The FEC proposed a conciliation agreement under which Davis would pay a substantial civil penalty. Davis responded by agreeing to toll the limitations period for an FEC enforcement action until resolution of this suit.</p>\n<p>Davis filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and a three-judge panel was convened. BCRA \u00a7 403, 116 Stat. 113, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2768</span> note following 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437h. While Davis requested that the case be decided before the general election campaign began on September 12, 2006, the FEC opposed the request, asserting the need for extensive discovery, and the request was denied. Ultimately, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>Ruling on those motions, the District Court began by addressing Davis' standing <i>sua sponte.</i> The Court concluded that Davis had standing, but rejected his claims on the merits and granted summary judgment for the FEC. 501 F.Supp.2d 22 (2007). Davis then invoked BCRA's exclusive avenue for appellate review \u0097 direct appeal to this Court. Note following \u00a7 437h. We deferred full consideration of our jurisdiction, 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 976, 169 L.Ed.2d 800 (2008), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Like the District Court, we must first ensure that we have jurisdiction to hear Davis' appeal. Article III restricts federal courts to the resolution of cases and controversies. <i>Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona,</i> 520 U.S. 43, 64, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997). That restriction requires that the party invoking federal jurisdiction have standing \u0097 the \"personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation.\" <i>Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,</i> 528 U.S. 167, 189, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). But it is not enough that the requisite interest exist at the outset. \"To qualify as a case fit for federal-court adjudication, `an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.'\" <i>Arizonans for Official English, supra,</i> at 67, 117 S.Ct. 1055. The FEC argues that Davis' appeal fails to present a constitutional case or controversy because Davis lacks standing and because his claims are moot. We address each of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As noted, the requirement that a claimant have \"standing is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.\" <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992); see also <i>Arizonans for Official English, supra,</i> at 64, 117 S.Ct. 1055. To qualify for standing, a claimant must present an injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendant's challenged behavior; and likely to be redressed by a favorable ruling. <i>Lujan, supra,</i> at 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p>The District Court held, and the parties do not dispute, that Davis possesses standing to challenge the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 319(b). When Davis filed suit, he had already declared his 2006 candidacy and had been forced by \u00a7 319(b) to disclose to his opponent that he intended to spend more than $350,000 in personal funds. At that time, Davis faced the imminent threat that he would have to follow up on that disclosure with further notifications after he in fact passed the $350,000 mark. Securing a declaration that \u00a7 319(b)'s requirements are unconstitutional and an injunction against their enforcement would have spared him from making those disclosures. That relief also would have removed the real threat that the FEC would pursue an enforcement action based on alleged violations of \u00a7 319(b) during his 2004 campaign. As a result, Davis possesses standing to challenge \u00a7 319(b)'s disclosure requirement.</p>\n<p>The fact that Davis has standing to challenge \u00a7 319(b) does not necessarily mean that he also has standing to challenge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2769</span> the scheme of contribution limitations that applies when \u00a7 319(a) comes into play. \"[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross.\" <i>Lewis v. Casey,</i> 518 U.S. 343, 358, n. 6, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Rather, \"a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press\" and \"`for each form of relief'\" that is sought. <i>DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno,</i> 547 U.S. 332, 352, 126 S.Ct. 1854, 164 L.Ed.2d 589 (2006) (quoting <i>Friends of Earth, supra,</i> at 185, 120 S.Ct. 693).</p>\n<p>In light of these principles, the FEC argues that Davis lacks standing to attack \u00a7 319(a)'s asymmetrical limits. When Davis commenced this action, his opponent had not yet qualified for the asymmetrical limits, and later, when his opponent did qualify to take advantage of those limits, he chose not to do so. Accordingly, the FEC argues that \u00a7 319(a) did not cause Davis any injury.</p>\n<p>While the proof required to establish standing increases as the suit proceeds, see <i>Lujan, supra,</i> at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, the standing inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed. <i>Friends of Earth, supra,</i> at 180, 120 S.Ct. 693; <i>Arizonans for Official English, supra,</i> at 68, n. 22, 117 S.Ct. 1055. As noted above, the injury required for standing need not be actualized. A party facing prospective injury has standing to sue where the threatened injury is real, immediate, and direct. <i>Los Angeles v. Lyons,</i> 461 U.S. 95, 102, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983); see also <i>Babbitt v. Farm Workers,</i> 442 U.S. 289, 298, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979) (A plaintiff may challenge the prospective operation of a statute that presents a realistic and impending threat of direct injury). Davis faced such an injury from the operation of \u00a7 319(a) when he filed suit. Davis had declared his candidacy and his intent to spend more than $350,000 of personal funds in the general election campaign whose onset was rapidly approaching. Section 319(a) would shortly burden his expenditure of personal funds by allowing his opponent to receive contributions on more favorable terms, and there was no indication that his opponent would forgo that opportunity. Indeed, the record at summary judgment indicated that most candidates who had the opportunity to receive expanded contributions had done so. App. 89. In these circumstances, we conclude that Davis faced the requisite injury from \u00a7 319(a) when he filed suit and has standing to challenge that provision's asymmetrical contribution scheme.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The FEC's mootness argument also fails. This case closely resembles <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007). There, Wisconsin Right to Life (WRTL), a nonprofit, ideological advocacy corporation, wished to run radio and TV ads within 30 days of the 2004 Washington primary, contrary to a restriction imposed by BCRA. WRTL sued the FEC, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Although the suit was not resolved before the 2004 election, we rejected the FEC's claim of mootness, finding that the case \"fit comfortably within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2662. That \"exception applies where `(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Spencer v. Kemna,</i> 523 U.S. 1, 17, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2770</span> In <i>WRTL,</i> \"despite BCRA's command that the cas[e] be expedited `to the greatest possible extent,'\" WRTL's claims could not reasonably be resolved before the election concluded. 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2662 (quoting \u00a7 403(a)(4), 116 Stat. 113, note following 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437h). Similarly, in this case despite BCRA's mandate to expedite and Davis' request that his case be resolved before the 2004 general election season commenced, Davis' case could not be resolved before the 2006 election concluded, demonstrating that his claims are capable of evading review.</p>\n<p>As to the second prong of the exception, even though WRTL raised an as-applied challenge, we found its suit capable of repetition where \"WRTL credibly claimed that it planned on running `materially similar' future\" ads subject to BCRA's prohibition and had, in fact, sought an injunction that would permit such an ad during the 2006 election. 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2663 (some internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the FEC conceded in its brief that Davis' \u00a7 319(a) claim would be capable of repetition if Davis planned to self-finance another bid for a House seat. Brief for Appellee 14, 20-21, and n. 5. Davis subsequently made a public statement expressing his intent to do so. See Reply Brief 16 (citing Terreri, Democrat Davis Confirms He'll Run Again for Congress, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, Mar. 27, 2008, p. 5B). As a result, we are satisfied that Davis' facial challenge is not moot.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We turn to the merits of Davis' claim that the First Amendment is violated by the contribution limits that apply when \u00a7 319(a) comes into play. Under this scheme, as previously noted, when a candidate spends more than $350,000 in personal funds and creates what the statute apparently regards as a financial imbalance, that candidate's opponent may qualify to receive both larger individual contributions than would otherwise be allowed and unlimited coordinated party expenditures. Davis contends that \u00a7 319(a) unconstitutionally burdens his exercise of his First Amendment right to make unlimited expenditures of his personal funds because making expenditures that create the imbalance has the effect of enabling his opponent to raise more money and to use that money to finance speech that counteracts and thus diminishes the effectiveness of Davis' own speech.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>If \u00a7 319(a) simply raised the contribution limits for all candidates, Davis' argument would plainly fail. This Court has previously sustained the facial constitutionality of limits on discrete and aggregate individual contributions and on coordinated party expenditures. <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 23-35, 38, 46-47, and n. 53, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.,</i> 533 U.S. 431, 437, 465, 121 S.Ct. 2351, 150 L.Ed.2d 461 (2001) <i>(Colorado II)</i><i>.</i> At the same time, the Court has recognized that such limits implicate First Amendment interests and that they cannot stand unless they are \"closely drawn\" to serve a \"sufficiently important interest,\" such as preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 136, 138, n. 40, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003); <i>Colorado II, supra,</i> at 456, 121 S.Ct. 2351; <i>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,</i> 528 U.S. 377, 387-388, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2771</span> 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000); <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 25-30, 38, 96 S.Ct. 612. When contribution limits are challenged as too restrictive, we have extended a measure of deference to the judgment of the legislative body that enacted the law. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Randall v. Sorrell,</i> 548 U.S. 230, 248, 126 S.Ct. 2479, 165 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (plurality opinion); <i>Nixon, supra,</i> at 396-397, 120 S.Ct. 897; <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 30, 111, 103-104, 96 S.Ct. 612. But we have held that limits that are too low cannot stand. <i>Randall, supra,</i> at 246-262, 126 S.Ct. 2479; <i>id.,</i> at 263, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>There is, however, no constitutional basis for attacking contribution limits on the ground that they are too high. Congress has no constitutional obligation to limit contributions at all; and if Congress concludes that allowing contributions of a certain amount does not create an undue risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption, a candidate who wishes to restrict an opponent's fundraising cannot argue that the Constitution demands that contributions be regulated more strictly. Consequently, if \u00a7 319(a)'s elevated contribution limits applied across the board, Davis would not have any basis for challenging those limits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Section 319(a), however, does not raise the contribution limits across the board. Rather, it raises the limits only for the non-self-financing candidate and does so only when the self-financing candidate's expenditure of personal funds causes the OPFA threshold to be exceeded. We have never upheld the constitutionality of a law that imposes different contribution limits for candidates who are competing against each other, and we agree with Davis that this scheme impermissibly burdens his First Amendment right to spend his own money for campaign speech.</p>\n<p>In <i>Buckley,</i> we soundly rejected a cap on a candidate's expenditure of personal funds to finance campaign speech. We held that a \"candidate . . . has a First Amendment right to engage in the discussion of public issues and vigorously and tirelessly to advocate his own election\" and that a cap on personal expenditures imposes \"a substantial,\" \"clea[r]\" and \"direc[t]\" restraint on that right. 424 U.S., at 52-53, 96 S.Ct. 612. We found that the cap at issue was not justified by \"[t]he primary governmental interest\" proffered in its defense, <i>i.e.,</i> \"the prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the political process.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 53, 96 S.Ct. 612. Far from preventing these evils, \"the use of personal funds,\" we observed, \"reduces the candidate's dependence on outside contributions and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse to which . . . contribution limitations are directed.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We also rejected the argument that the expenditure cap could be justified on the ground that it served \"[t]he ancillary interest in equalizing the relative financial resources of candidates competing for elective office.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 54, 96 S.Ct. 612. This putative interest, we noted, was \"clearly not sufficient to justify the . . . infringement of fundamental First Amendment rights.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p><i>Buckley</i>'s emphasis on the fundamental nature of the right to spend personal funds for campaign speech is instructive. While BCRA does not impose a cap on a candidate's expenditure of personal funds, it imposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises that First Amendment right. Section 319(a) requires a candidate to choose between the First Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2772</span> Many candidates who can afford to make large personal expenditures to support their campaigns may choose to do so despite \u00a7 319(a), but they must shoulder a special and potentially significant burden if they make that choice. See <i>Day v. Holahan,</i> 34 F.3d 1356, 1359-1360 (C.A.8 1994) (concluding that a Minnesota law that increased a candidate's expenditure limits and eligibility for public funds based on independent expenditures against her candidacy burdened the speech of those making the independent expenditures); Brief for Appellee 29 (conceding that \"[\u00a7]319 does impose some consequences on a candidate's choice to self-finance beyond certain amounts\"). Under \u00a7 319(a), the vigorous exercise of the right to use personal funds to finance campaign speech produces fundraising advantages for opponents in the competitive context of electoral politics. Cf. <i>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal.,</i> 475 U.S. 1, 14, 106 S.Ct. 903, 89 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (plurality opinion) (finding infringement on speech rights where if the plaintiff spoke it could \"be forced . . . to help disseminate hostile views\").</p>\n<p>The resulting drag on First Amendment rights is not constitutional simply because it attaches as a consequence of a statutorily imposed choice. In <i>Buckley,</i> we held that Congress \"may engage in public financing of election campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure limitations\" even though we found an independent limit on overall campaign expenditures to be unconstitutional. 424 U.S., at 57, n. 65, 96 S.Ct. 612; see <i>id.,</i> at 54-58, 96 S.Ct. 612. But the choice involved in <i>Buckley</i> was quite different from the choice imposed by \u00a7 319(a). In <i>Buckley,</i> a candidate, by forgoing public financing, could retain the unfettered right to make unlimited personal expenditures. Here, \u00a7 319(a) does not provide any way in which a candidate can exercise that right without abridgment. Instead, a candidate who wishes to exercise that right has two choices: abide by a limit on personal expenditures or endure the burden that is placed on that right by the activation of a scheme of discriminatory contribution limits. The choice imposed by \u00a7 319(a) is not remotely parallel to that in <i>Buckley.</i></p>\n<p>Because \u00a7 319(a) imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech, that provision cannot stand unless it is \"justified by a compelling state interest,\" <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,</i> 479 U.S. 238, 256, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986); see also, <i>e.g., McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Austin v.

No such justification is present here.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2773</span> The burden imposed by \u00a7 319(a) on the expenditure of personal funds is not justified by any governmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption. The <i>Buckley</i> Court reasoned that reliance on personal funds <i>reduces</i> the threat of corruption, and therefore \u00a7 319(a), by discouraging use of personal funds, disserves the anticorruption interest. Similarly, given Congress' judgment that liberalized limits for non-self-financing candidates do not unduly imperil anticorruption interests, it is hard to imagine how the denial of liberalized limits to self-financing candidates can be regarded as serving anticorruption goals sufficiently to justify the resulting constitutional burden.</p>\n<p>The Government maintains that \u00a7 319(a)'s asymmetrical limits are justified because they \"level electoral opportunities for candidates of different personal wealth.\" Brief for Appellee 34. \"Congress enacted Section 319,\" the Government writes, \"to reduce <i>the natural advantage</i> that wealthy individuals possess in campaigns for federal office.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 33 (emphasis added). Our prior decisions, however, provide no support for the proposition that this is a legitimate government objective. See <i>Nixon,</i> 528 U.S., at 428, 120 S.Ct. 897 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (\"`[P]reventing corruption or the appearance of corruption are the only legitimate and compelling government interests thus far identified for restricting campaign finances'\" (quoting <i>National Conservative Political Action Comm., supra,</i> at 496-497, 105 S.Ct. 1459)); <i>Randall,</i> 548 U.S., at 268, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (noting \"the interests the Court has recognized as compelling, <i>i.e.,</i> the prevention of corruption or the appearance thereof\"). On the contrary, in <i>Buckley,</i> we held that \"[t]he interest in equalizing the financial resources of candidates\" did not provide a \"justification for restricting\" candidates' overall campaign expenditures, particularly where equalization \"might serve . . . to handicap a candidate who lacked substantial name recognition or exposure of his views before the start of the campaign.\" 424 U.S., at 56-57, 96 S.Ct. 612. We have similarly held that the interest \"in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections\" cannot support a cap on expenditures for \"express advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates,\" as \"the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612; see also <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 227, 124 S.Ct. 619 (noting, in assessing standing, that there is no legal right to have the same resources to influence the electoral process). Cf. <i>Austin, supra,</i> at 705, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (rejecting as \"antithetical to the First Amendment\" \"the notion that the government has a legitimate interest in restricting the quantity of speech to equalize the relative influence of speakers on elections\").</p>\n<p>The argument that a candidate's speech may be restricted in order to \"level electoral opportunities\" has ominous implications because it would permit Congress to arrogate the voters' authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates competing for office. See <i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 791-792, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (\"[T]he people in our democracy are entrusted with the responsibility for judging and evaluating the relative merits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2774</span> of conflicting arguments\" and \"may consider, in making their judgment, the source and credibility of the advocate\"). Different candidates have different strengths. Some are wealthy; others have wealthy supporters who are willing to make large contributions. Some are celebrities; some have the benefit of a well-known family name. Leveling electoral opportunities means making and implementing judgments about which strengths should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election. The Constitution, however, confers upon voters, not Congress, the power to choose the Members of the House of Representatives, Art. I, \u00a7 2, and it is a dangerous business for Congress to use the election laws to influence the voters' choices. See <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 791, n. 31, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (The \"[g]overnment is forbidden to assume the task of ultimate judgment, lest the people lose their ability to govern themselves\").</p>\n<p>Finally, the Government contends that \u00a7 319(a) is justified because it ameliorates the deleterious effects that result from the tight limits that federal election law places on individual campaign contributions and coordinated party expenditures. These limits, it is argued, make it harder for candidates who are not wealthy to raise funds and therefore provide a substantial advantage for wealthy candidates. Accordingly, \u00a7 319(a) can be seen, not as a legislative effort to interfere with the natural operation of the electoral process, but as a legislative effort to mitigate the untoward consequences of Congress' own handiwork and restore \"the normal relationship between a candidate's financial resources and the level of popular support for his candidacy.\" Brief for Appellee 33.</p>\n<p>Whatever the merits of this argument as an original matter, it is fundamentally at war with the analysis of expenditure and contributions limits that this Court adopted in <i>Buckley</i> and has applied in subsequent cases. The advantage that wealthy candidates now enjoy and that \u00a7 319(a) seeks to reduce is an advantage that flows directly from <i>Buckley</i>'s disparate treatment of expenditures and contributions. If that approach is sound\u0097and the Government does not urge us to hold otherwise<sup>[8]</sup>\u0097it is hard to see how undoing the consequences of that decision can be viewed as a compelling interest. If the normally applicable limits on individual contributions and coordinated party contributions are seriously distorting the electoral process, if they are feeding a \"public perception that wealthy people can buy seats in Congress,\" Brief for Appellee 34, and if those limits are not needed in order to combat corruption, then the obvious remedy is to raise or eliminate those limits. But the unprecedented step of imposing different contribution and coordinated party expenditure limits on candidates vying for the same seat is antithetical to the First Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The remaining issue that we must consider is the constitutionality of \u00a7 319(b)'s disclosure requirements. \"[W]e have repeatedly found that compelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2775</span> privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 64, 96 S.Ct. 612. As a result, we have closely scrutinized disclosure requirements, including requirements governing independent expenditures made to further individuals' political speech. <i>Id.,</i> at 75, 96 S.Ct. 612. To survive this scrutiny, significant encroachments \"cannot be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental interest.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 64, 96 S.Ct. 612. Instead, there must be \"a `relevant correlation' or `substantial relation' between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed,\" and the governmental interest \"must survive exacting scrutiny.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (footnotes omitted). That is, the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on First Amendment rights. <i>Id.,</i> at 68, 71, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\n<p>The \u00a7 319(b) disclosure requirements were designed to implement the asymmetrical contribution limits provided for in \u00a7 319(a), and as discussed above, \u00a7 319(a) violates the First Amendment. In light of that holding, the burden imposed by the \u00a7 319(b) requirements cannot be justified, and it follows that they too are unconstitutional.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>In sum, we hold that \u00a7\u00a7 319(a) and (b) violate the First Amendment.

To reduce that advantage, and to combat the perception that congressional seats are for sale to the highest bidder, Congress has relaxed the restrictions that would otherwise limit the amount of contributions that the opponents of self-funding candidates may accept from their supporters. In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, the District Court held that because the Millionaire's Amendment does not impose any burden whatsoever on the self-funding candidate's freedom to speak, it does not violate the First Amendment, and because it does no more than diminish the unequal strength of the self-funding candidate, it does not violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. I agree completely with the District Court's opinion, specifically its adherence to our decision in <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). While I would affirm for the reasons given by the District Court, I believe it appropriate to add these additional comments on the premise that underlies the constitutional prohibition on expenditure limitations, and on my reasons for concluding that the Millionaire's Amendment represents a modest, sensible, and plainly constitutional attempt by Congress to minimize the advantages enjoyed by wealthy candidates vis-\u00e1-vis those who must rely on the support of others to fund their pursuit of public office.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>According to the Court's decision in <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 18, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (<i>per curiam)</i><i>,</i> the vice that condemns expenditure limitations is that they \"impose direct quantity restrictions\" on political speech.<sup>[1]</sup> A limitation on the amount of money that a candidate is permitted to spend, the <i>Buckley</i> Court concluded, \"reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 19, 96 S.Ct. 612. Accordingly, the Court determined that any regulation of the quantity of money spent on campaigns for office ought to be viewed as a direct regulation of speech itself.</p>\n<p>Justice White firmly disagreed with the <i>Buckley</i> Court's holding on expenditure limitations, explaining that such regulations should be analyzed, not as direct restrictions on speech, but rather as akin to time, place, and manner regulations, which will be upheld \"so long as the purposes they serve are legitimate and sufficiently substantial.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264, 96 S.Ct. 612 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Although I did not participate in the Court's decision in <i>Buckley,</i> I have since been persuaded that Justice White\u0097who maintained his steadfast opposition to <i>Buckley</i>'s view of expenditure limits, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm.,</i> 470 U.S. 480, 507-512, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985) (dissenting opinion)\u0097was correct. Indeed, it was <i>Buckley</i> that represented a break from 65 years of established practice, as well as a probable departure from the views of the Framers of the relevant provisions of the Constitution itself. See <i>Randall v. Sorrell,</i> 548 U.S. 230, 274, 280-281, 126 S.Ct. 2479, 165 L.Ed.2d 482 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2779</span> In my view, a number of purposes, both legitimate and substantial, may justify the imposition of reasonable limitations on the expenditures permitted during the course of any single campaign. For one, such limitations would \"free candidates and their staffs from the interminable burden of fundraising.\" <i>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 518 U.S. 604, 649, 116 S.Ct. 2309, 135 L.Ed.2d 795 (1996) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Moreover, the imposition of reasonable limitations would likely have the salutary effect of improving the quality of the exposition of ideas. After all, orderly debate is always more enlightening than a shouting match that awards points on the basis of decibels rather than reasons. Quantity limitations are commonplace in any number of other contexts in which high-value speech occurs. Litigants in this Court pressing issues of the utmost importance to the Nation are allowed only a fixed time for oral debate and a maximum number of pages for written argument. As listeners and as readers, judges need time to reflect on the merits of an issue; repetitious arguments are disfavored and are usually especially unpersuasive. Indeed, experts in the art of advocacy agree that \"lawyers go on for too long, and when they do it doesn't help their case.\"<sup>[2]</sup> It seems to me that Congress is entitled to make the judgment that voters deserve the same courtesy and the same opportunity to reflect as judges; flooding the airwaves with slogans and sound-bites may well do more to obscure the issues than to enlighten listeners. At least in the context of elections, the notion that rules limiting the quantity of speech are just as offensive to the First Amendment as rules limiting the content of speech is plainly incorrect.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>If, as I have come to believe, Congress could attempt to reduce the millionaire candidate's advantage by imposing reasonable limits on <i>all</i> candidates' expenditures, it follows <i>a fortiori</i> that the eminently reasonable scheme before us today survives constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Even accepting the <i>Buckley</i> Court's holding that expenditure limits as such are uniquely incompatible with the First Amendment, it remains my firm conviction that the Millionaire's Amendment represents a good-faith attempt by Congress to regulate, within the bounds of the Constitution, one particularly pernicious feature of many contemporary political campaigns.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>It cannot be gainsaid that the twin rationales at the heart of the Millionaire's Amendment\u0097reducing the importance of wealth as a criterion for public office and countering the perception that seats in the United States Congress are available for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2780</span> purchase by the wealthiest bidder\u0097are important Government interests. It is also evident that Congress, in enacting the provision, crafted a solution that was carefully tailored to those concerns. Davis insists, however, that the Government's interests are insufficiently weighty to justify what he believes are intrusions upon his rights under the First Amendment and the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment, and that, regardless of the strength of the justifications offered, Congress' solution is not sufficiently tailored to addressing the twin concerns it has identified. His arguments are unpersuasive on all counts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The thrust of Davis' First Amendment challenge is that by relaxing the contribution limits applicable to the opponent of a self-funding candidate, the Millionaire's Amendment punishes the candidate who chooses to self-fund. Extrapolating from the zero-sum nature of a political race, Davis insists that any benefit conferred upon a self-funder's opponent thereby works a detriment to the self-funding candidate. Accordingly, he argues, the scheme burdens the self-funding candidate's First Amendment right to speak freely and to participate fully in the political process.</p>\n<p>But Davis cannot show that the Millionaire's Amendment causes him\u0097or any other self-funding candidate\u0097any First Amendment injury whatsoever. The Millionaire's Amendment quiets no speech at all. On the contrary, it does no more than assist the opponent of a self-funding candidate in his attempts to make his voice heard; this amplification in no way mutes the voice of the millionaire, who remains able to speak as loud and as long as he likes in support of his campaign. Enhancing the speech of the millionaire's opponent, far from contravening the First Amendment, actually advances its core principles. If only one candidate can make himself heard, the voter's ability to make an informed choice is impaired.<sup>[5]</sup> And the self-funding candidate's ability to engage meaningfully in the political process is in no way undermined by this provision.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Even were we to credit Davis' view that the benefit conferred on the self-funding candidate's opponent burdens the self-funder's First Amendment rights, the purposes of the Amendment surely justify its effects. The Court is simply wrong when it suggests that the \"governmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2773, is the sole governmental interest sufficient to support campaign finance regulations. See <i>ante,</i> at 2773-2774. It is true, of course, that in upholding the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971's (FECA) limits on the size of contributions to political campaigns, the <i>Buckley</i> Court held that preventing both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption were Government interests of sufficient weight that they justified any infringement upon First Amendment freedoms that resulted from FECA's contribution <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2781</span> limits; the Court explained that, \"[t]o the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <i>quid pro quo</i> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined. . . . Of almost equal concern . . . is the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.\" 424 U.S., at 26-27, 96 S.Ct. 612. It is also true that the Court found that same interest insufficient to justify FECA's expenditure limitations. <i>Id.,</i> at 45-46, 52-56, 96 S.Ct. 612. But it does not follow that the <i>Buckley</i> Court concluded that <i>only</i> the interest in combating corruption and the appearance of corruption can justify congressional regulation of campaign financing.</p>\n<p>Indeed, we have long recognized the strength of an independent governmental interest in reducing both the influence of wealth on the outcomes of elections, and the appearance that wealth alone dictates those results. In case after case, we have held that statutes designed to protect against the undue influence of aggregations of wealth on the political process\u0097 where such statutes are responsive to the identified evil\u0097do not contravene the First Amendment. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce,</i> 494 U.S. 652, 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652 (1990) (upholding statute designed to combat \"the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas\"); <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,</i> 479 U.S. 238, 257, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986) (\"Th[e] concern over the corrosive influence of concentrated corporate wealth reflects the conviction that it is important to protect the integrity of the marketplace of political ideas. . . . Direct corporate spending on political activity raises the prospect that resources amassed in the economic marketplace may be used to provide an unfair advantage in the political marketplace\"); cf. <i>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC,</i> 395 U.S. 367, 390, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969) (upholding constitutionality of several components of the FCC's \"fair coverage\" requirements, and explaining that \"[i]t is the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail, rather than to countenance monopolization of that market\").</p>\n<p>Although the focus of our cases has been on aggregations of corporate rather than individual wealth, there is no reason that their logic\u0097specifically, their concerns about the corrosive and distorting effects of wealth on our political process\u0097is not equally applicable in the context of individual wealth. For, as we explained in <i>McConnell,</i> \"Congress' historical concern with the `political potentialities of wealth' and their `untoward consequences for the democratic process'. . . has long reached beyond corporate money,\" 540 U.S., at 116, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>United States v. Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S. 567, 577-578, 77 S.Ct. 529, 1 L.Ed.2d 563 (1957)).</p>\n<p>Minimizing the effect of concentrated wealth on our political process, and the concomitant interest in addressing the dangers that attend the perception that political power can be purchased, are, therefore, sufficiently weighty objectives to justify significant congressional action. And, not only was Congress motivated by proper and weighty goals in crafting the Millionaire's Amendment, the details of the scheme it devised are genuinely responsive to the problems it identified. The statute's \"Opposition Personal Funds Amount\" formula permits a self-funding candidate to spend as much money as he wishes, while <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2782</span> taking into account fundraising by the relevant campaigns; it thereby ensures that a candidate who happens to enjoy a significant fundraising advantage against a self-funding opponent does not reap a windfall as a result of the enhanced contribution limits. Rather, the self-funder's opponent may avail himself of the enhanced contribution limits only until parity is achieved, at which point he becomes again ineligible for contributions above the normal maximum. See \u00a7\u00a7 441a-1(a)(1)(A)-(C).</p>\n<p>It seems uncontroversial that \"there is no good reason to allow disparities in wealth to be translated into disparities in political power. A well-functioning democracy distinguishes between market processes of purchase and sale on the one hand and political processes of voting and reason-giving on the other.\" Sunstein, Political Equality and Unintended Consequences, 94 Colum. L.Rev. 1390 (1994). In light of that clear truth, Congress' carefully crafted attempt to reduce the distinct advantages enjoyed by wealthy candidates for congressional office does not offend the First Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Davis' equal protection argument, which the Court finds unnecessary to address, <i>ante,</i> at 2775, n. 9, fares no better. He claims that by permitting only the self-funder's opponent to avail himself of the increased contribution limits, the statute creates an unwarranted disparity between the self-funder and his opponent. But, as we explained in <i>McConnell,</i> \"Congress is fully entitled to consider . . . real-world differences . . . when crafting a system of campaign finance regulation.\" 540 U.S., at 188, 124 S.Ct. 619. And <i>Buckley</i> itself acknowledged, in the course of upholding FECA's public financing scheme, that \"the Constitution does not require Congress to treat all declared candidates the same.\" 424 U.S., at 97, 96 S.Ct. 612. It blinks reality to contend that the millionaire candidate is situated identically to a nonmillionaire opponent, and Congress was under no obligation to indulge any such fiction. Accordingly, Davis has failed to establish that he was deprived of the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In sum, I share Judge Wright's view that nothing in the Constitution \"prevents us, as a political community, from making certain modest but important changes in the kind of process we want for selecting our political leaders,\" Wright, Politics and the Constitution: Is Money Speech? 85 Yale L.J. 1001, 1005 (1976). In my judgment, the Millionaire's Amendment represents just such a change. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice BREYER joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>Agreeing with the Court that appellant Jack Davis has standing and that this case is not moot, I join Part II of the Court's opinion. On the merits, however, I part ways with the Court. The District Court's careful and persuasive opinion, as I see it, correctly concluded that the provisions challenged in this case are entirely consistent with <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> and all other relevant decisions of this Court. I therefore join Part II of Justice STEVENS' opinion.</p>\n<p>I resist joining other portions of Justice STEVENS' opinion, however, to the extent that they address <i>Buckley</i>'s distinction between expenditure and contribution limits and, correspondingly, <i>Buckley</i>'s holding that expenditure limits impose \"direct quantity restrictions on political communication,\" <i>id.,</i> at 18, 96 S.Ct. 612. Appellee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2783</span> Federal Election Commission has not asked us to overrule <i>Buckley</i>; consequently, the issue has not been briefed. Convinced that the challenged statute encounters no constitutional shoal under our precedents, I would leave reconsideration of <i>Buckley</i> for a later day and case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  All undesignated references in this opinion to 2 U.S.C. are to the 2006 edition.</p>\n<p>[2]  These limits are adjusted for inflation every two years. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(c).</p>\n<p>[3]  BCRA \u00a7 319(a) is set out in an Appendix to this opinion. Although what we refer to as \u00a7\u00a7 319(a) and (b) are actually \u00a7 315A(a) and (b) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which were added to that Act by BCRA \u00a7 319(a), we follow the convention of the parties in making reference to \u00a7\u00a7 319(a) and (b).</p>\n<p>[4]  BCRA \u00a7 304 similarly regulates self-financed Senate bids. 116 Stat. 97, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(i).</p>\n<p>[5]  The OPFA is calculated as follows. For each candidate, expenditures of personal funds are added to 50% of the funds raised for the election at issue measured at designated dates in the year preceding the election. The resulting figures are compared, and if the difference is greater than $350,000, the asymmetrical limits take effect. See \u00a7\u00a7 441a-1(a)(1), (2).</p>\n<p>[6]  In light of this conclusion, we need not decide whether the threat of an FEC enforcement action for alleged 2004 violations would be sufficient to keep this controversy alive.</p>\n<p>[7]  Even if \u00a7 319(a) were characterized as a limit on contributions rather than expenditures, it is doubtful whether it would survive. A contribution limit involving \"`\"significant interference\" with associational rights'\" must be \"`\"closely drawn\"'\" to serve a \"`sufficiently important interest.'\" <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 136, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). For the reasons explained <i>infra,</i> at 2773-2774, the chief interest proffered in support of the asymmetrical contribution scheme\u0097leveling electoral opportunities\u0097cannot justify the infringement of First Amendment interests.</p>\n<p>[8]  Justice STEVENS would revisit and reject <i>Buckley</i>'s treatment of expenditure limits. <i>Post,</i> at ___-___ (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). The Government has not urged us to take that step, and in any event, Justice STEVENS' proposal is unsound. He suggests that restricting the quantity of campaign speech would improve the quality of that speech, but it would be dangerous for the Government to regulate core political speech for the asserted purpose of improving that speech. And in any event, there is no reason to suppose that restricting the quantity of campaign speech would have the desired effect.</p>\n<p>[9]  Because we conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 319(a) and (b) violate the First Amendment, we need not address Davis' claim that they also violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p>[1]  The <i>Buckley</i> Court invalidated two different types of limits on campaign expenditures: limits on the amount of \"personal or family resources\" a candidate could spend on his own campaign, 424 U.S., at 51-54, 96 S.Ct. 612, and overall limits on campaign expenditures, <i>id.,</i> at 54-60, 96 S.Ct. 612. In my judgment the Court was mistaken in striking down both of those provisions; I treat them together here.</p>\n<p>[2]  Brust, A Voice for the Write: Tips on Making Your Case From a Supremely Reliable Source, 94 A.B.A.J. 37 (May 2008) (interview with Justice SCALIA and Bryan Garner).</p>\n<p>[3]  The Court is of course correct that \"it would be dangerous for the Government to regulate core political speech for the asserted purpose of improving that speech.\" <i>Ante,</i> at ___, n. 8. But campaign expenditures are not <i>themselves</i> \"core political speech\"; they merely may <i>enable</i> such speech (as well as its repetition <i>ad nauseam</i>). In my judgment, it is simply not the case that the First Amendment \"provides the same measure of protection\" to the use of money to enable speech as it does to speech itself. <i>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,</i> 528 U.S. 377, 398, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000) (STEVENS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>[4]  I note at the outset of this discussion, however, that I agree with the Court's conclusion that Davis has standing to challenge \u00a7\u00a7 319(a) and (b), and that the case is not moot; I therefore join Part II of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>[5]  \"In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential, for the identities of those who are elected will inevitably shape the course that we follow as a nation.\" <i>Buckley v.

In neither event is his engagement in the political process in any sense impeded.</p>\n\n</div>",

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE\n               DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n       No. 07\u2013320.      Argued April 22, 2008\u2014Decided June 26, 2008\nFederal-law limits on the amount of contributions a House of Represen-\n  tatives candidate and his authorized committee may receive from an\n  individual, and the amount his party may devote to coordinated cam-\n  paign expenditures, 2 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7441a(a)(1)(A), (a)(3)(A), (c), and (d),\n  normally apply equally to all competitors for a seat and their author-\n  ized committees. However, \u00a7319(a) of the Bipartisan Campaign Re-\n  form Act of 2002 (BCRA), 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441a\u20131(a), part of the so-called\n  \u201cMillionaire\u2019s Amendment,\u201d fundamentally alters this scheme when,\n  as a result of a candidate\u2019s expenditure of personal funds, the \u201coppo-\n  sition personal funds amount\u201d (OPFA) exceeds $350,000. The OPFA\n  is a statistic comparing competing candidates\u2019 personal expenditures\n  and taking account of certain other fundraising. When a \u201cself-\n  financing\u201d candidate\u2019s personal expenditure causes the OPFA to pass\n  $350,000, a new, asymmetrical regulatory scheme comes into play.\n  The self-financing candidate remains subject to the normal limita-\n  tions, but his opponent, the \u201cnon-self-financing\u201d candidate, may re-\n  ceive individual contributions at treble the normal limit from indi-\n  viduals who have reached the normal limit on aggregate\n  contributions, and may accept coordinated party expenditures with-\n  out limit. See \u00a7\u00a7441a\u20131(a)(1)(A)\u2013(C). Because calculating the OPFA\n  requires certain information about the self-financing candidate\u2019s\n  campaign assets and personal expenditures, \u00a7319(b) requires him to\n  file an initial \u201cdeclaration of intent\u201d revealing the amount of personal\n  funds the candidate intends to spend in excess of $350,000, and to\n  make additional disclosures to the other candidates, their national\n  parties, and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as his personal\n  expenditures exceed certain benchmarks.\n     Appellant Davis, a candidate for a House seat in 2004 and 2006\n2               DAVIS v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    who lost both times to the incumbent, notified the FEC for the 2006\n    election, in compliance with \u00a7319(b), that he intended to spend $1\n    million in personal funds. After the FEC informed him it had reason\n    to believe he had violated \u00a7319 by failing to report personal expendi-\n    tures during the 2004 campaign, he filed this suit for a declaration\n    that \u00a7319 is unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the FEC\n    from enforcing the section during the 2006 election. The District\n    Court concluded sua sponte that Davis had standing, but rejected his\n    claims on the merits and granted the FEC summary judgment.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has jurisdiction to hear Davis\u2019 appeal. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (a) Davis has standing to challenge \u00a7319(b)\u2019s disclosure require-\n ments. When he filed suit, he had already declared his 2006 candi-\n dacy and had been forced by \u00a7319(b) to disclose to his opponent that\n he intended to spend more than $350,000 in personal funds. He also\n faced the imminent threat that he would have to follow up on that\n disclosure with further notifications once he passed the $350,000\n mark. Securing a declaration that \u00a7319(b) is unconstitutional and an\n injunction against its enforcement would have spared him from mak-\n ing those disclosures and also would have removed the real threat\n that the FEC would pursue an enforcement action based on alleged\n \u00a7319(b) violations during his 2004 campaign. Davis also has stand-\n ing to challenge \u00a7319(a)\u2019s asymmetrical contribution limits. The\n standing inquiry focuses on whether the party invoking jurisdiction\n had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed, see,\n e.g., Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC),\n Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 180, and a party facing prospective injury has\n standing where the threatened injury is real, immediate, and direct,\n see, e.g., Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102. Davis faced the\n requisite injury from \u00a7319(a) when he filed suit: He had already de-\n clared his candidacy and his intent to spend more than $350,000 of\n personal funds in the general election campaign whose onset was\n rapidly approaching. Section 319(a) would shortly burden his per-\n sonal expenditure by allowing his opponent to receive contributions\n on more favorable terms, and there was no indication that his oppo-\n nent would forgo that opportunity. Pp. 6\u20138.\n       (b) The FEC\u2019s argument that the Court lacks jurisdiction because\n Davis\u2019 claims are moot also fails. In Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wis-\n consin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL), 551 U. S. ___, this Court rejected a\n very similar claim of mootness, finding that the case \u201cfit comfortably\n within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of\n repetition, yet evading review.\u201d Id., at ___. That \u201cexception applies\n where \u2018(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully\n litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable\n                    Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                       3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nexpectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the\nsame action again.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. First, despite BCRA\u2019s command that the\ncase be expedited to the greatest possible extent and Davis\u2019 request\nthat his case be resolved before the 2006 election, the case could not\nbe resolved before the 2006 election. See id., at ___. Second, the FEC\nhas conceded that Davis\u2019 \u00a7319(a) claim would be capable of repetition\nif he planned to self-finance another bid for a House seat, and he sub-\nsequently made a public statement expressing his intent to do so.\nSee id., at ___ . Pp. 8\u20139.\n   2. Sections 319(a) and (b) violate the First Amendment. If \u00a7319(a)\u2019s\nelevated contribution limits applied across the board to all candi-\ndates, Davis would have no constitutional basis for challenging them.\nSection 319(a), however, raises the limits only for non-self-financing\ncandidates and only when the self-financing candidate\u2019s expenditure\nof personal funds causes the OPFA threshold to be exceeded. This\nCourt has never upheld the constitutionality of a law that imposes\ndifferent contribution limits for candidates competing against each\nother, and it agrees with Davis that this scheme impermissibly bur-\ndens his First Amendment right to spend his own money for cam-\npaign speech. In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, the Court soundly re-\njected a cap on a candidate\u2019s expenditure of personal funds to finance\ncampaign speech, holding that a \u201ccandidate . . . has a First Amend-\nment right to . . . vigorously and tirelessly . . . advocate his own elec-\ntion,\u201d and that a cap on personal expenditures imposes \u201ca substan-\ntial,\u201d \u201cclea[r,]\u201d and \u201cdirec[t]\u201d restraint on that right, id., at 52\u201353. It\nfound the cap at issue not justified by \u201c[t]he primary governmental\ninterest\u201d in \u201cthe prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the\npolitical process,\u201d id., at 53, or by \u201c[t]he ancillary interest in equaliz-\ning the relative financial resources of candidates competing for elec-\ntive office,\u201d id., at 54. Buckley is instructive here. While BCRA does\nnot impose a cap on a candidate\u2019s expenditure of personal funds, it\nimposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly ex-\nercises that First Amendment right, requiring him to choose between\nthe right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to\ndiscriminatory fundraising limitations. The resulting drag on First\nAmendment rights is not constitutional simply because it attaches as\na consequence of a statutorily imposed choice. Id., at 54\u201357, and n.\n65, distinguished. The burden is not justified by any governmental\ninterest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption, see\nid., at 53. Nor can an interest in leveling electoral opportunities for\ncandidates of different personal wealth justify \u00a7319(a)\u2019s asymmetrical\nlimits, see id., at 56\u201357. The Court has never recognized this interest\nas a legitimate objective and doing so would have ominous implica-\ntions for the voters\u2019 authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates\n4               DAVIS v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    competing for office. Finally, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s ar-\n    gument that \u00a7319(a) is justified because it ameliorates the deleteri-\n    ous effects resulting from the tight limits federal election law places\n    on individual campaign contributions and coordinated party expendi-\n    tures. Whatever this argument\u2019s merits as an original matter, it is\n    fundamentally at war with Buckley\u2019s analysis of expenditure and\n    contributions limits, which this Court has applied in subsequent\n    cases. Pp. 10\u201317.\n         (c) Because \u00a7319(a) is unconstitutional, \u00a7319(b)\u2019s disclosure re-\n    quirements, which were designed to implement the asymmetrical\n    contribution limits, are as well. \u201c[C]ompelled disclosure, in itself, can\n    seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by\n    the First Amendment,\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64, so the Court closely\n    scrutinizes such requirements, id., at 75. For significant encroach-\n    ments to survive, there must be \u201ca \u2018relevant correlation\u2019 or \u2018substan-\n    tial relation\u2019 between the governmental interest and the information\n    required to be disclosed\u201d and the governmental interest must reflect\n    the seriousness of the burden on First Amendment rights. Ibid.\n    Given \u00a7319(a)\u2019s unconstitutionality, the burden imposed by the\n    \u00a7319(b) requirements cannot be justified. P. 18.\n501 F.

Although\n\nwhat we refer to as \u00a7\u00a7319(a) and (b) are actually \u00a7315A(a) and (b) of the\nFederal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which were added to that Act\nby BCRA \u00a7319(a), we follow the convention of the parties in making\nreference to \u00a7\u00a7319(a) and (b).\n  4 BCRA \u00a7304 similarly regulates self-financed Senate bids. 116 Stat.\n\n97, 2 U.

For each candidate, expendi-\n\ntures of personal funds are added to 50% of the funds raised for the\nelection at issue measured at designated dates in the year preceding\nthe election. The resulting figures are compared, and if the difference\nis greater than $350,000, the asymmetrical limits take effect. See\n\u00a7\u00a7441a\u20131(a)(1), (2).\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(for convenience, such candidates will be referred to as\n\u201cself-financing\u201d), a new, asymmetrical regulatory scheme\ncomes into play. The self-financing candidate remains\nsubject to the limitations noted above, but the candidate\u2019s\nopponent (the \u201cnon-self-financing\u201d candidate) may receive\nindividual contributions at treble the normal limit (e.g.,\n$6,900 rather than the current $2,300), even from indi-\nviduals who have reached the normal aggregate contribu-\ntions cap, and may accept coordinated party expenditures\nwithout limit. See \u00a7\u00a7441a\u20131(a)(1)(A)\u2013(C). Once the non-\nself-financing candidate\u2019s receipts exceed the OPFA, the\nprior limits are revived. \u00a7441a\u20131(a)(3). A candidate who\ndoes not spend the contributions received under the\nasymmetrical limits must return them. \u00a7441a\u20131(a)(4).\n   In order to calculate the OPFA, certain information is\nneeded about the self-financing candidate\u2019s campaign\nassets and personal expenditures. Section 319(b) thus\nrequires self-financing candidates to make three types of\ndisclosures. First, within 15 days after entering a race, a\ncandidate must file a \u201c[d]eclaration of intent\u201d revealing the\namount of personal funds the candidate intends to spend\nin excess of $350,000. 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441a\u20131(b)(1)(B). A\ncandidate who does not intend to cross this threshold may\nsimply declare an intent to spend no personal funds. 11\nCFR \u00a7400.20(a)(2) (2008). Second, within 24 hours of\ncrossing or becoming obligated to cross the $350,000 mark,\nthe candidate must file an \u201c[i]nitial notification.\u201d 2\nU. S. C. \u00a7441a\u20131(b)(1)(C). Third, the candidate must file\nan \u201c[a]dditional notification\u201d within 24 hours of making or\nbecoming obligated to make each additional expenditure of\n$10,000 or more using personal funds. \u00a7441a\u20131(b)(1)(D).\nThe initial and additional notifications must provide the\ndate and amount of each expenditure from personal funds,\nand all notifications must be filed with the Federal Elec-\ntion Commission (FEC), all other candidates for the seat,\nand the national parties of all those candidates. \u00a7441a\u2013\n4          DAVIS v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1(b)(1)(E). Failure to comply with the reporting require-\nments may result in civil and criminal penalties.\n\u00a7\u00a7437g(a)(5)\u2013(6), (d)(1).\n   A non-self-financing candidate and the candidate\u2019s\ncommittee face less extensive disclosure requirements.\nWithin 24 hours after receiving an \u201cinitial\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d\nnotification filed by a self-financing opponent, a non-self-\nfinancing candidate must provide notice to the FEC and\nthe national and state committees of the candidate\u2019s party\nif the non-self-financing candidate concludes based on the\nnewly acquired information that the OPFA has passed the\n$350,000 mark. 11 CFR \u00a7400.30(b)(2). In addition, when\nthe additional contributions that a non-self-financing\ncandidate is authorized to receive pursuant to the asym-\nmetrical limitations scheme equals the OPFA, the non-\nself-financing candidate must notify the FEC and the\nappropriate national and state committees within 24\nhours. \u00a7400.31(e)(1)(ii). The non-self-financing candidate\nmust also provide notice regarding any refunds of \u201cexcess\nfunds\u201d (funds received under the increased limits but not\nused in the campaign). \u00a7\u00a7400.50, 400.54. For their part,\npolitical parties must notify the FEC and the candidate\nthey support within 24 hours of making any expenditures\nthat exceed the normal limit for coordinated party expen-\nditures. \u00a7400.30(c)(2).\n                             B\n  Appellant Jack Davis was the Democratic candidate for\nthe House of Representatives from New York\u2019s 26th Con-\ngressional District in 2004 and 2006. In both elections, he\nlost to the incumbent. In his brief, Davis discloses having\nspent $1.2 million, principally his own funds, on his 2004\ncampaign. Brief for Appellant 4. He reports spending\n$2.3 million in 2006, all but $126,000 of which came from\npersonal funds. Id., at 13. His opponent in 2006 spent no\npersonal funds. Indeed, although the OPFA calculation\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovided the opportunity for Davis\u2019 opponent to raise\nnearly $1.5 million under \u00a7319(a)\u2019s asymmetrical limits,\nDavis\u2019 opponent adhered to the normal contribution limits.\n   Davis\u2019 2006 candidacy began in March 2006, when he\nfiled with the FEC a \u201cStatement of Candidacy\u201d and, in\ncompliance with \u00a7319(b), declared that he intended to\nspend $1 million in personal funds during the general\nelection. Two months later, in anticipation of this expen-\nditure and its \u00a7319 consequences, Davis filed suit against\nthe FEC, requesting that \u00a7319 be declared unconstitu-\ntional and that the FEC be enjoined from enforcing it\nduring the 2006 election.\n   After Davis declared his candidacy but before he filed\nsuit, the FEC\u2019s general counsel notified him that it had\nreason to believe that he had violated \u00a7319 by failing to\nreport personal expenditures during the 2004 campaign.\nThe FEC proposed a conciliation agreement under which\nDavis would pay a substantial civil penalty. Davis re-\nsponded by agreeing to toll the limitations period for an\nFEC enforcement action until resolution of this suit.\n   Davis filed this action in the United States District\nCourt for the District of Columbia, and a three-judge panel\nwas convened. BCRA \u00a7403, 116 Stat. 113, note following 2\nU. S. C. \u00a7437h. While Davis requested that the case be\ndecided before the general election campaign began on\nSeptember 12, 2006, the FEC opposed the request, assert-\ning the need for extensive discovery, and the request was\ndenied. Ultimately, the parties filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment.\n   Ruling on those motions, the District Court began by\naddressing Davis\u2019 standing sua sponte. The Court con-\ncluded that Davis had standing, but rejected his claims on\nthe merits and granted summary judgment for the FEC.\n501 F. Supp. 2d 22 (2007). Davis then invoked BCRA\u2019s\nexclusive avenue for appellate review\u2014direct appeal to\nthis Court. Note following \u00a7437h. We deferred full con-\n6           DAVIS v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsideration of our jurisdiction, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), and we\nnow reverse.\n                              II\n   Like the District Court, we must first ensure that we\nhave jurisdiction to hear Davis\u2019 appeal. Article III re-\nstricts federal courts to the resolution of cases and contro-\nversies. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520\nU. S. 43, 64 (1997). That restriction requires that the\nparty invoking federal jurisdiction have standing\u2014the\n\u201cpersonal interest that must exist at the commencement of\nthe litigation.\u201d Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envi-\nronmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 189 (2000)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). But it is not enough\nthat the requisite interest exist at the outset. \u201cTo qualify\nas a case fit for federal-court adjudication, \u2018an actual\ncontroversy must be extant at all stages of review, not\nmerely at the time the complaint is filed.\u2019 \u201d Arizonans for\nOfficial English, supra, at 67. The FEC argues that Davis\u2019\nappeal fails to present a constitutional case or controversy\nbecause Davis lacks standing and because his claims are\nmoot. We address each of these issues in turn.\n                             A\n  As noted, the requirement that a claimant have \u201cstand-\ning is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-\ncontroversy requirement of Article III.\u201d Lujan v. Defend-\ners of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992); see also Arizo-\nnans for Official English, supra, at 64. To qualify for\nstanding, a claimant must present an injury that is con-\ncrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly trace-\nable to the defendant\u2019s challenged behavior; and likely to\nbe redressed by a favorable ruling. Lujan, supra, at 560\u2013\n561.\n  The District Court held, and the parties do not dispute,\nthat Davis possesses standing to challenge the disclosure\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirements of \u00a7319(b). When Davis filed suit, he had\nalready declared his 2006 candidacy and had been forced\nby \u00a7319(b) to disclose to his opponent that he intended to\nspend more than $350,000 in personal funds. At that\ntime, Davis faced the imminent threat that he would have\nto follow up on that disclosure with further notifications\nafter he in fact passed the $350,000 mark. Securing a\ndeclaration that \u00a7319(b)\u2019s requirements are unconstitu-\ntional and an injunction against their enforcement would\nhave spared him from making those disclosures. That\nrelief also would have removed the real threat that the\nFEC would pursue an enforcement action based on alleged\nviolations of \u00a7319(b) during his 2004 campaign. As a\nresult, Davis possesses standing to challenge \u00a7319(b)\u2019s\ndisclosure requirement.\n   The fact that Davis has standing to challenge \u00a7319(b)\ndoes not necessarily mean that he also has standing to\nchallenge the scheme of contribution limitations that\napplies when \u00a7319(a) comes into play. \u201c[S]tanding is not\ndispensed in gross.\u201d Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 358,\nn. 6 (1996). Rather, \u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate stand-\ning for each claim he seeks to press\u201d and \u201c \u2018for each form of\nrelief\u2019 \u201d that is sought. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547\nU. S. 332, 352 (2006) (quoting Friends of Earth, supra, at\n185).\n   In light of these principles, the FEC argues that Davis\nlacks standing to attack \u00a7319(a)\u2019s asymmetrical limits.\nWhen Davis commenced this action, his opponent had not\nyet qualified for the asymmetrical limits, and later, when\nhis opponent did qualify to take advantage of those limits,\nhe chose not to do so. Accordingly, the FEC argues that\n\u00a7319(a) did not cause Davis any injury.\n   While the proof required to establish standing increases\nas the suit proceeds, see Lujan, supra, at 561, the stand-\ning inquiry remains focused on whether the party invok-\ning jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome\n8          DAVIS v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen the suit was filed. Friends of Earth, supra, at 180;\nArizonans for Official English, supra, at 68, n. 22. As\nnoted above, the injury required for standing need not be\nactualized. A party facing prospective injury has standing\nto sue where the threatened injury is real, immediate, and\ndirect. Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102 (1983); see\nalso Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298 (1979) (A\nplaintiff may challenge the prospective operation of a\nstatute that presents a realistic and impending threat of\ndirect injury). Davis faced such an injury from the opera-\ntion of \u00a7319(a) when he filed suit. Davis had declared his\ncandidacy and his intent to spend more than $350,000 of\npersonal funds in the general election campaign whose\nonset was rapidly approaching. Section 319(a) would\nshortly burden his expenditure of personal funds by allow-\ning his opponent to receive contributions on more favor-\nable terms, and there was no indication that his opponent\nwould forgo that opportunity. Indeed, the record at sum-\nmary judgment indicated that most candidates who had\nthe opportunity to receive expanded contributions had\ndone so. App. 89. In these circumstances, we conclude\nthat Davis faced the requisite injury from \u00a7319(a) when he\nfiled suit and has standing to challenge that provision\u2019s\nasymmetrical contribution scheme.\n                              B\n  The FEC\u2019s mootness argument also fails. This case\nclosely resembles Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wisconsin\nRight to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. ___ (2007). There, Wisconsin\nRight to Life (WRTL), a nonprofit, ideological advocacy\ncorporation, wished to run radio and TV ads within 30\ndays of the 2004 Washington primary, contrary to a re-\nstriction imposed by BCRA. WRTL sued the FEC, seeking\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. Although the suit was\nnot resolved before the 2004 election, we rejected the\nFEC\u2019s claim of mootness, finding that the case \u201cfit com-\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfortably within the established exception to mootness for\ndisputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 8). That \u201cexception applies where \u2018(1) the\nchallenged action is in its duration too short to be fully\nlitigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a\nreasonable expectation that the same complaining party\nwill be subject to the same action again.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting\nSpencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 17 (1998)).\n   In WRTL, \u201cdespite BCRA\u2019s command that the cas[e] be\nexpedited \u2018to the greatest possible extent,\u2019 \u201d WRTL\u2019s claims\ncould not reasonably be resolved before the election con-\ncluded.    551 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quoting\n\u00a7403(a)(4), 116 Stat. 113, note following 2 U. S. C. \u00a7437h).\nSimilarly, in this case despite BCRA\u2019s mandate to expedite\nand Davis\u2019 request that his case be resolved before the\n2004 general election season commenced, Davis\u2019 case could\nnot be resolved before the 2006 election concluded, demon-\nstrating that his claims are capable of evading review.\n   As to the second prong of the exception, even though\nWRTL raised an as-applied challenge, we found its suit\ncapable of repetition where \u201cWRTL credibly claimed that\nit planned on running \u2018materially similar\u2019 future\u201d ads\nsubject to BCRA\u2019s prohibition and had, in fact, sought an\ninjunction that would permit such an ad during the 2006\nelection. 551 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (some internal\nquotation marks omitted). Here, the FEC conceded in its\nbrief that Davis\u2019 \u00a7319(a) claim would be capable of repeti-\ntion if Davis planned to self-finance another bid for a\nHouse seat. Brief for Appellee 14, 20\u201321, and n. 5. Davis\nsubsequently made a public statement expressing his\nintent to do so. See Reply Brief 16 (citing Terreri, Democ-\nrat Davis Confirms He\u2019ll Run Again for Congress, Roches-\nter Democrat and Chronicle, Mar. 27, 2008, p. 5B). As a\nresult, we are satisfied that Davis\u2019 facial challenge is not\n10            DAVIS v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmoot.6\n                           III\n  We turn to the merits of Davis\u2019 claim that the First\nAmendment is violated by the contribution limits that\napply when \u00a7319(a) comes into play. Under this scheme,\nas previously noted, when a candidate spends more than\n$350,000 in personal funds and creates what the statute\napparently regards as a financial imbalance, that candi-\ndate\u2019s opponent may qualify to receive both larger individ-\nual contributions than would otherwise be allowed and\nunlimited coordinated party expenditures. Davis contends\nthat \u00a7319(a) unconstitutionally burdens his exercise of his\nFirst Amendment right to make unlimited expenditures of\nhis personal funds because making expenditures that\ncreate the imbalance has the effect of enabling his oppo-\nnent to raise more money and to use that money to finance\nspeech that counteracts and thus diminishes the effective-\nness of Davis\u2019 own speech.\n                             A\n   If \u00a7319(a) simply raised the contribution limits for all\ncandidates, Davis\u2019 argument would plainly fail. This\nCourt has previously sustained the facial constitutionality\nof limits on discrete and aggregate individual contribu-\ntions and on coordinated party expenditures. Buckley v.\nValeo, 424 U. S. 1, 23\u201335, 38, 46\u201347, and n. 53 (1976) (per\ncuriam); Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Colorado Republican\nFederal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 437, 465 (2001)\n(Colorado II). At the same time, the Court has recognized\nthat such limits implicate First Amendment interests and\nthat they cannot stand unless they are \u201cclosely drawn\u201d to\nserve a \u201csufficiently important interest,\u201d such as prevent-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 In light of this conclusion, we need not decide whether the threat of\n\nan FEC enforcement action for alleged 2004 violations would be suffi-\ncient to keep this controversy alive.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning corruption and the appearance of corruption. See, e.g.,\nMcConnell v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 540 U. S. 93, 136,\n138, n. 40 (2003); Colorado II, supra, at 456; Nixon v.\nShrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 387\u2013388\n(2000); Buckley, supra, at 25\u201330, 38. When contribution\nlimits are challenged as too restrictive, we have extended\na measure of deference to the judgment of the legislative\nbody that enacted the law. See, e.g., Randall v. Sorrell,\n548 U. S. 230, 248 (2006) (plurality opinion); Nixon, supra,\nat 396\u2013397; Buckley, supra, at 30, 111, 103\u2013104. But we\nhave held that limits that are too low cannot stand. Ran-\ndall, supra, at 246\u2013262; id., at 263 (ALITO, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment).\n  There is, however, no constitutional basis for attacking\ncontribution limits on the ground that they are too high.\nCongress has no constitutional obligation to limit contri-\nbutions at all; and if Congress concludes that allowing\ncontributions of a certain amount does not create an un-\ndue risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption, a\ncandidate who wishes to restrict an opponent\u2019s fundraising\ncannot argue that the Constitution demands that contri-\nbutions be regulated more strictly. Consequently, if\n\u00a7319(a)\u2019s elevated contribution limits applied across the\nboard, Davis would not have any basis for challenging\nthose limits.\n                             B\n  Section 319(a), however, does not raise the contribution\nlimits across the board. Rather, it raises the limits only\nfor the non-self-financing candidate and does so only when\nthe self-financing candidate\u2019s expenditure of personal\nfunds causes the OPFA threshold to be exceeded. We have\nnever upheld the constitutionality of a law that imposes\ndifferent contribution limits for candidates who are com-\npeting against each other, and we agree with Davis that\nthis scheme impermissibly burdens his First Amendment\n12         DAVIS v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nright to spend his own money for campaign speech.\n    In Buckley, we soundly rejected a cap on a candidate\u2019s\nexpenditure of personal funds to finance campaign speech.\nWe held that a \u201ccandidate . . . has a First Amendment\nright to engage in the discussion of public issues and\nvigorously and tirelessly to advocate his own election\u201d and\nthat a cap on personal expenditures imposes \u201ca substan-\ntial,\u201d \u201cclea[r]\u201d and \u201cdirec[t]\u201d restraint on that right. 424\nU. S., at 52\u201353. We found that the cap at issue was not\njustified by \u201c[t]he primary governmental interest\u201d prof-\nfered in its defense, i.e., \u201cthe prevention of actual and\napparent corruption of the political process.\u201d Id., at 53.\nFar from preventing these evils, \u201cthe use of personal\nfunds,\u201d we observed, \u201creduces the candidate\u2019s dependence\non outside contributions and thereby counteracts the\ncoercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse to which\n. . . contribution limitations are directed.\u201d Ibid. We also\nrejected the argument that the expenditure cap could be\njustified on the ground that it served \u201c[t]he ancillary in-\nterest in equalizing the relative financial resources of\ncandidates competing for elective office.\u201d Id., at 54. This\nputative interest, we noted, was \u201cclearly not sufficient to\njustify the . . . infringement of fundamental First Amend-\nment rights.\u201d Ibid.\n    Buckley\u2019s emphasis on the fundamental nature of the\nright to spend personal funds for campaign speech is\ninstructive. While BCRA does not impose a cap on a\ncandidate\u2019s expenditure of personal funds, it imposes an\nunprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly\nexercises that First Amendment right.

Under\n\u00a7319(a), the vigorous exercise of the right to use personal\nfunds to finance campaign speech produces fundraising\nadvantages for opponents in the competitive context of\nelectoral politics. Cf. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public\nUtil. Comm\u2019n of Cal., 475 U.

In Buckley, we held that\nCongress \u201cmay engage in public financing of election\ncampaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds\non an agreement by the candidate to abide by specified\nexpenditure limitations\u201d even though we found an inde-\npendent limit on overall campaign expenditures to be\nunconstitutional. 424 U.

In Buckley, a candi-\ndate, by forgoing public financing, could retain the unfet-\ntered right to make unlimited personal expenditures.\nHere, \u00a7319(a) does not provide any way in which a candi-\ndate can exercise that right without abridgment. Instead,\na candidate who wishes to exercise that right has two\nchoices: abide by a limit on personal expenditures or en-\ndure the burden that is placed on that right by the activa-\ntion of a scheme of discriminatory contribution limits.

No such\njustification is present here.7\n   The burden imposed by \u00a7319(a) on the expenditure of\npersonal funds is not justified by any governmental inter-\nest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corrup-\ntion. The Buckley Court reasoned that reliance on per-\nsonal funds reduces the threat of corruption, and therefore\n\u00a7319(a), by discouraging use of personal funds, disserves\nthe anticorruption interest.

See Bellotti, supra, at\n791\u2013792 (\u201c[T]he people in our democracy are entrusted\nwith the responsibility for judging and evaluating the\nrelative merits of conflicting arguments\u201d and \u201cmay consider,\nin making their judgment, the source and credibility of the\nadvocate\u201d). Different candidates have different strengths.\nSome are wealthy; others have wealthy supporters who are\nwilling to make large contributions.

These limits, it is argued, make it\nharder for candidates who are not wealthy to raise funds\nand therefore provide a substantial advantage for wealthy\ncandidates. Accordingly, \u00a7319(a) can be seen, not as a\nlegislative effort to interfere with the natural operation of\nthe electoral process, but as a legislative effort to mitigate\nthe untoward consequences of Congress\u2019 own handiwork\nand restore \u201cthe normal relationship between a candi-\ndate\u2019s financial resources and the level of popular support\nfor his candidacy.\u201d Brief for Appellee 33.\n  Whatever the merits of this argument as an original\nmatter, it is fundamentally at war with the analysis of\nexpenditure and contributions limits that this Court\nadopted in Buckley and has applied in subsequent cases.\nThe advantage that wealthy candidates now enjoy and\nthat \u00a7319(a) seeks to reduce is an advantage that flows\ndirectly from Buckley\u2019s disparate treatment of expendi-\ntures and contributions. If that approach is sound\u2014and\nthe Government does not urge us to hold otherwise8\u2014it is\nhard to see how undoing the consequences of that decision\ncan be viewed as a compelling interest.

He suggests\nthat restricting the quantity of campaign speech would improve the\nquality of that speech, but it would be dangerous for the Government to\nregulate core political speech for the asserted purpose of improving that\nspeech. And in any event, there is no reason to suppose that restricting\nthe quantity of campaign speech would have the desired effect.\n18            DAVIS v.

C.\n\u00a7441a\u20131 (2006 ed.), is the product of a congressional judg\u00ad\nment that candidates who are willing and able to spend\nover $350,000 of their own money in seeking election to\nCongress enjoy an advantage over opponents who must\nrely on contributions to finance their campaigns. To re\u00ad\nduce that advantage, and to combat the perception that\ncongressional seats are for sale to the highest bidder,\nCongress has relaxed the restrictions that would other\u00ad\nwise limit the amount of contributions that the opponents\nof self-funding candidates may accept from their support\u00ad\ners. In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, the District\nCourt held that because the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment does\nnot impose any burden whatsoever on the self-funding\ncandidate\u2019s freedom to speak, it does not violate the First\nAmendment, and because it does no more than diminish\nthe unequal strength of the self-funding candidate, it does\nnot violate the equal protection component of the Fifth\nAmendment. I agree completely with the District Court\u2019s\nopinion, specifically its adherence to our decision in\nMcConnell v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 540 U. S. 93\n2             DAVIS v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n(2003). While I would affirm for the reasons given by the\nDistrict Court, I believe it appropriate to add these addi\u00ad\ntional comments on the premise that underlies the consti\u00ad\ntutional prohibition on expenditure limitations, and on my\nreasons for concluding that the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment\nrepresents a modest, sensible, and plainly constitutional\nattempt by Congress to minimize the advantages enjoyed\nby wealthy candidates vis-\u00e0-vis those who must rely on the\nsupport of others to fund their pursuit of public office.\n                               I\n   According to the Court\u2019s decision in Buckley v. Valeo,\n424 U. S. 1, 18 (1976) (per curiam), the vice that condemns\nexpenditure limitations is that they \u201cimpose direct quan\u00ad\ntity restrictions\u201d on political speech.1 A limitation on the\namount of money that a candidate is permitted to spend,\nthe Buckley Court concluded, \u201creduces the quantity of\nexpression by restricting the number of issues discussed,\nthe depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience\nreached.\u201d Id., at 19. Accordingly, the Court determined\nthat any regulation of the quantity of money spent on\ncampaigns for office ought to be viewed as a direct regula\u00ad\ntion of speech itself.\n   Justice White firmly disagreed with the Buckley Court\u2019s\nholding on expenditure limitations, explaining that such\nregulations should be analyzed, not as direct restrictions\non speech, but rather as akin to time, place, and manner\nregulations, which will be upheld \u201cso long as the purposes\nthey serve are legitimate and sufficiently substantial.\u201d\nId., at 264 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Buckley Court invalidated two different types of limits on cam\u00ad\n\npaign expenditures: limits on the amount of \u201cpersonal or family re\u00ad\nsources\u201d a candidate could spend on his own campaign, 424 U. S., at\n51\u201354, and overall limits on campaign expenditures, id., at 54\u201360. In\nmy judgment the Court was mistaken in striking down both of those\nprovisions; I treat them together here.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\npart). Although I did not participate in the Court\u2019s deci\u00ad\nsion in Buckley, I have since been persuaded that Justice\nWhite\u2014who maintained his steadfast opposition to Buck-\nley\u2019s view of expenditure limits, see, e.g., Federal Election\nComm\u2019n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm.,\n470 U. S. 480, 507\u2013512 (1985) (dissenting opinion)\u2014was\ncorrect. Indeed, it was Buckley that represented a break\nfrom 65 years of established practice, as well as a probable\ndeparture from the views of the Framers of the relevant\nprovisions of the Constitution itself.         See Randall\nv. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 274, 280\u2013281 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting).\n   In my view, a number of purposes, both legitimate and\nsubstantial, may justify the imposition of reasonable\nlimitations on the expenditures permitted during the\ncourse of any single campaign. For one, such limitations\nwould \u201cfree candidates and their staffs from the intermi\u00ad\nnable burden of fundraising.\u201d Colorado Republican Fed-\neral Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 518\nU. S. 604, 649 (1996) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Moreover,\nthe imposition of reasonable limitations would likely have\nthe salutary effect of improving the quality of the exposi\u00ad\ntion of ideas. After all, orderly debate is always more\nenlightening than a shouting match that awards points on\nthe basis of decibels rather than reasons. Quantity limita\u00ad\ntions are commonplace in any number of other contexts in\nwhich high-value speech occurs. Litigants in this Court\npressing issues of the utmost importance to the Nation are\nallowed only a fixed time for oral debate and a maximum\nnumber of pages for written argument. As listeners and\nas readers, judges need time to reflect on the merits of an\nissue; repetitious arguments are disfavored and are usu\u00ad\nally especially unpersuasive. Indeed, experts in the art of\nadvocacy agree that \u201clawyers go on for too long, and when\n4             DAVIS v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nthey do it doesn\u2019t help their case.\u201d2 It seems to me that\nCongress is entitled to make the judgment that voters\ndeserve the same courtesy and the same opportunity to\nreflect as judges; flooding the airwaves with slogans and\nsound-bites may well do more to obscure the issues than to\nenlighten listeners. At least in the context of elections, the\nnotion that rules limiting the quantity of speech are just\nas offensive to the First Amendment as rules limiting the\ncontent of speech is plainly incorrect.3\n  If, as I have come to believe, Congress could attempt to\nreduce the millionaire candidate\u2019s advantage by imposing\nreasonable limits on all candidates\u2019 expenditures, it fol\u00ad\nlows a fortiori that the eminently reasonable scheme\nbefore us today survives constitutional scrutiny.\n                            II\n  Even accepting the Buckley Court\u2019s holding that expen\u00ad\nditure limits as such are uniquely incompatible with the\nFirst Amendment, it remains my firm conviction that the\nMillionaire\u2019s Amendment represents a good-faith attempt\nby Congress to regulate, within the bounds of the Consti\u00ad\ntution, one particularly pernicious feature of many con\u00ad\ntemporary political campaigns.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Brust, A Voice for the Write: Tips on Making Your Case From a\n\nSupremely Reliable Source, 94 A. B. A. J. 37 (May 2008) (interview\nwith JUSTICE SCALIA and Bryan Garner).\n  3 The Court is of course correct that \u201cit would be dangerous for the\n\nGovernment to regulate core political speech for the asserted purpose of\nimproving that speech.\u201d Ante, at 17, n. 8. But campaign expenditures\nare not themselves \u201ccore political speech\u201d; they merely may enable such\nspeech (as well as its repetition ad nauseam). In my judgment, it is\nsimply not the case that the First Amendment \u201cprovides the same\nmeasure of protection\u201d to the use of money to enable speech as it does to\nspeech itself. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S.\n377, 398 (2000) (STEVENS, J., concurring).\n  4 I note at the outset of this discussion, however, that I agree with the\n\nCourt\u2019s conclusion that Davis has standing to challenge \u00a7\u00a7319(a) and\n(b), and that the case is not moot; I therefore join Part II of the Court\u2019s\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   It cannot be gainsaid that the twin rationales at the\nheart of the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment\u2014reducing the\nimportance of wealth as a criterion for public office and\ncountering the perception that seats in the United States\nCongress are available for purchase by the wealthiest\nbidder\u2014are important Government interests. It is also\nevident that Congress, in enacting the provision, crafted a\nsolution that was carefully tailored to those concerns.\nDavis insists, however, that the Government\u2019s interests\nare insufficiently weighty to justify what he believes are\nintrusions upon his rights under the First Amendment\nand the equal protection component of the Fifth Amend\u00ad\nment, and that, regardless of the strength of the justifica\u00ad\ntions offered, Congress\u2019 solution is not sufficiently tailored\nto addressing the twin concerns it has identified. His\narguments are unpersuasive on all counts.\n                             A\n  The thrust of Davis\u2019 First Amendment challenge is that\nby relaxing the contribution limits applicable to the oppo\u00ad\nnent of a self-funding candidate, the Millionaire\u2019s\nAmendment punishes the candidate who chooses to self-\nfund. Extrapolating from the zero-sum nature of a politi\u00ad\ncal race, Davis insists that any benefit conferred upon a\nself-funder\u2019s opponent thereby works a detriment to the\nself-funding candidate.     Accordingly, he argues, the\nscheme burdens the self-funding candidate\u2019s First\nAmendment right to speak freely and to participate fully\nin the political process.\n  But Davis cannot show that the Millionaire\u2019s Amend\u00ad\nment causes him\u2014or any other self-funding candidate\u2014\nany First Amendment injury whatsoever. The Million\u00ad\naire\u2019s Amendment quiets no speech at all. On the con\u00ad\ntrary, it does no more than assist the opponent of a self\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nopinion.\n6             DAVIS v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nfunding candidate in his attempts to make his voice heard;\nthis amplification in no way mutes the voice of the mil\u00ad\nlionaire, who remains able to speak as loud and as long as\nhe likes in support of his campaign. Enhancing the speech\nof the millionaire\u2019s opponent, far from contravening the\nFirst Amendment, actually advances its core principles. If\nonly one candidate can make himself heard, the voter\u2019s\nability to make an informed choice is impaired.5 And the\nself-funding candidate\u2019s ability to engage meaningfully in\nthe political process is in no way undermined by this\nprovision.6\n   Even were we to credit Davis\u2019 view that the benefit\nconferred on the self-funding candidate\u2019s opponent bur\u00ad\ndens the self-funder\u2019s First Amendment rights, the pur\u00ad\nposes of the Amendment surely justify its effects. The\nCourt is simply wrong when it suggests that the \u201cgovern\u00ad\nmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception\nof corruption,\u201d ante, at 14, is the sole governmental inter\u00ad\nest sufficient to support campaign finance regulations.\nSee ante, at 15\u201317. It is true, of course, that in upholding\nthe Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971\u2019s (FECA)\nlimits on the size of contributions to political campaigns,\nthe Buckley Court held that preventing both actual cor\u00ad\nruption and the appearance of corruption were Govern\u00ad\nment interests of sufficient weight that they justified any\ninfringement upon First Amendment freedoms that re\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 \u201cIn\n        a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citi\u00ad\nzenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential,\nfor the identities of those who are elected will inevitably shape the\ncourse that we follow as a nation.\u201d Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 14\u201315\n(1976) (per curiam).\n   6 The self-funder retains the choice to structure his campaign\u2019s fund\u00ad\n\ning as he pleases: He may choose to fund his own campaign subject to\nno limitations whatsoever and still accept limited donations from\nsupporters; alternatively, he may forgo self-financing and rely on\ncontributions alone, at the same level as his opponent. In neither event\nis his engagement in the political process in any sense impeded.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

Of almost\nequal concern . . . is the impact of the appearance of cor\u00ad\nruption stemming from public awareness of the opportuni\u00ad\nties for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual\nfinancial contributions.\u201d 424 U. S., at 26\u201327. It is also\ntrue that the Court found that same interest insufficient\nto justify FECA\u2019s expenditure limitations. Id., at 45\u201346,\n52\u201356. But it does not follow that the Buckley Court\nconcluded that only the interest in combating corruption\nand the appearance of corruption can justify congressional\nregulation of campaign financing.\n   Indeed, we have long recognized the strength of an\nindependent governmental interest in reducing both the\ninfluence of wealth on the outcomes of elections, and the\nappearance that wealth alone dictates those results. In\ncase after case, we have held that statutes designed to\nprotect against the undue influence of aggregations of\nwealth on the political process\u2014where such statutes are\nresponsive to the identified evil\u2014do not contravene the\nFirst Amendment. See, e.g., Austin v. Michigan Chamber\nof Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 660 (1990) (upholding statute\ndesigned to combat \u201cthe corrosive and distorting effects of\nimmense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated\nwith the help of the corporate form and that have little or\nno correlation to the public\u2019s support for the corporation\u2019s\npolitical ideas\u201d); Federal Election Comm\u2019n v.

For, as we explained in McConnell,\n\u201cCongress\u2019 historical concern with the \u2018political potentiali\u00ad\nties of wealth\u2019 and their \u2018untoward consequences for the\ndemocratic process\u2019. . . has long reached beyond corporate\nmoney,\u201d 540 U. S., at 116 (quoting United States v. Auto-\nmobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567, 577\u2013578 (1957)).\n   Minimizing the effect of concentrated wealth on our\npolitical process, and the concomitant interest in address\u00ad\ning the dangers that attend the perception that political\npower can be purchased, are, therefore, sufficiently\nweighty objectives to justify significant congressional\naction. And, not only was Congress motivated by proper\nand weighty goals in crafting the Millionaire\u2019s Amend\u00ad\nment, the details of the scheme it devised are genuinely\nresponsive to the problems it identified. The statute\u2019s\n\u201cOpposition Personal Funds Amount\u201d formula permits a\nself-funding candidate to spend as much money as he\nwishes, while taking into account fundraising by the rele\u00ad\nvant campaigns; it thereby ensures that a candidate who\nhappens to enjoy a significant fundraising advantage\nagainst a self-funding opponent does not reap a windfall\nas a result of the enhanced contribution limits.

Contributions from individual donors during a 2-year election cycle are subject to a cap, which is currently set at $2,300. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2766</span> \u00a7\u00a7 441a(a)(1)(A), (c); 72 Fed.Reg. 5295 (2007). In addition, no funds may be accepted from an individual whose aggregate contributions to candidates and their committees during the election cycle have reached the legal limit, currently $42,700. See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 441a(a)(3)(A), (c); 72 Fed. Reg. 5295. A candidate also may not accept general election coordinated expenditures by national or state political party committees that exceed an imposed limit. See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 441a(c), (d). Currently, the limit for candidates in States with more than one House seat is $40,900. 72 Fed.Reg. 5294.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Section 319(a) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 116 Stat. 109, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a-1(a),<sup>[3]</sup> part of the so-called \"Millionaire's Amendment,\" fundamentally alters this scheme when, as a result of a candidate's expenditure of personal funds, the \"opposition personal funds amount\" (OPFA) exceeds $350,000.<sup>[4]</sup> The OPFA, in simple terms, is a statistic that compares the expenditure of personal funds by competing candidates and also takes into account to some degree certain other fundraising.<sup>[5]</sup> See \u00a7 441a-1(a). When a candidate's expenditure of personal funds causes the OPFA to pass the $350,000 mark (for convenience, such candidates will be referred to as \"self-financing\"), a new, asymmetrical regulatory scheme comes into play. The self-financing candidate remains subject to the limitations noted above, but the candidate's opponent (the \"non-self-financing\" candidate) may receive individual contributions at treble the normal limit <i>(e.g.,</i> $6,900 rather than the current $2,300), even from individuals who have reached the normal aggregate contributions cap, and may accept coordinated party expenditures without limit. See \u00a7\u00a7 441a-1(a)(1)(A)-(C). Once the non-self-financing candidate's receipts exceed the OPFA, the prior limits are revived. \u00a7 441a-1(a)(3). A candidate who does not spend the contributions received under the asymmetrical limits must return them. \u00a7 441a-1(a)(4).</p>\n<p>In order to calculate the OPFA, certain information is needed about the self-financing candidate's campaign assets and personal expenditures. Section 319(b) thus requires self-financing candidates to make three types of disclosures. First, within 15 days after entering a race, a candidate must file a \"[d]eclaration of intent\" revealing the amount of personal funds the candidate intends to spend in excess of $350,000. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a-1(b)(1)(B). A candidate who does not intend to cross this threshold may simply declare an intent to spend no personal funds. 11 CFR \u00a7 400.20(a)(2) (2008). Second, within 24 hours of crossing or becoming obligated to cross the $350,000 mark, the candidate must file an \"[i]nitial notification.\" 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a-1(b)(1)(C). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2767</span> Third, the candidate must file an \"[a]dditional notification\" within 24 hours of making or becoming obligated to make each additional expenditure of $10,000 or more using personal funds. \u00a7 441a-1(b)(1)(D). The initial and additional notifications must provide the date and amount of each expenditure from personal funds, and all notifications must be filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), all other candidates for the seat, and the national parties of all those candidates. \u00a7 441a-1(b)(1)(E). Failure to comply with the reporting requirements may result in civil and criminal penalties. \u00a7\u00a7 437g(a)(5)-(6), (d)(1).</p>\n<p>A non-self-financing candidate and the candidate's committee face less extensive disclosure requirements. Within 24 hours after receiving an \"initial\" or \"additional\" notification filed by a self-financing opponent, a non-self-financing candidate must provide notice to the FEC and the national and state committees of the candidate's party if the non-self-financing candidate concludes based on the newly acquired information that the OPFA has passed the $350,000 mark. 11 CFR \u00a7 400.30(b)(2). In addition, when the additional contributions that a non-self-financing candidate is authorized to receive pursuant to the asymmetrical limitations scheme equals the OPFA, the non-self-financing candidate must notify the FEC and the appropriate national and state committees within 24 hours. \u00a7 400.31(e)(1)(ii). The non-self-financing candidate must also provide notice regarding any refunds of \"excess funds\" (funds received under the increased limits but not used in the campaign). \u00a7\u00a7 400.50, 400.54. For their part, political parties must notify the FEC and the candidate they support within 24 hours of making any expenditures that exceed the normal limit for coordinated party expenditures. \u00a7 400.30(c)(2).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Appellant Jack Davis was the Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives from New York's 26th Congressional District in 2004 and 2006. In both elections, he lost to the incumbent. In his brief, Davis discloses having spent $1.2 million, principally his own funds, on his 2004 campaign. Brief for Appellant 4. He reports spending $2.3 million in 2006, all but $126,000 of which came from personal funds. <i>Id.,</i> at 13. His opponent in 2006 spent no personal funds. Indeed, although the OPFA calculation provided the opportunity for Davis' opponent to raise nearly $1.5 million under \u00a7 319(a)'s asymmetrical limits, Davis' opponent adhered to the normal contribution limits.</p>\n<p>Davis' 2006 candidacy began in March 2006, when he filed with the FEC a \"Statement of Candidacy\" and, in compliance with \u00a7 319(b), declared that he intended to spend $1 million in personal funds during the general election. Two months later, in anticipation of this expenditure and its \u00a7 319 consequences, Davis filed suit against the FEC, requesting that \u00a7 319 be declared unconstitutional and that the FEC be enjoined from enforcing it during the 2006 election.</p>\n<p>After Davis declared his candidacy but before he filed suit, the FEC's general counsel notified him that it had reason to believe that he had violated \u00a7 319 by failing to report personal expenditures during the 2004 campaign. The FEC proposed a conciliation agreement under which Davis would pay a substantial civil penalty. Davis responded by agreeing to toll the limitations period for an FEC enforcement action until resolution of this suit.</p>\n<p>Davis filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and a three-judge panel was convened. BCRA \u00a7 403, 116 Stat. 113, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2768</span> note following 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437h. While Davis requested that the case be decided before the general election campaign began on September 12, 2006, the FEC opposed the request, asserting the need for extensive discovery, and the request was denied. Ultimately, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>Ruling on those motions, the District Court began by addressing Davis' standing <i>sua sponte.</i> The Court concluded that Davis had standing, but rejected his claims on the merits and granted summary judgment for the FEC. 501 F.Supp.2d 22 (2007). Davis then invoked BCRA's exclusive avenue for appellate review \u0097 direct appeal to this Court. Note following \u00a7 437h. We deferred full consideration of our jurisdiction, 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 976, 169 L.Ed.2d 800 (2008), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Like the District Court, we must first ensure that we have jurisdiction to hear Davis' appeal. Article III restricts federal courts to the resolution of cases and controversies. <i>Arizonans for Official English v.

The FEC argues that Davis' appeal fails to present a constitutional case or controversy because Davis lacks standing and because his claims are moot. We address each of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As noted, the requirement that a claimant have \"standing is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.\" <i>Lujan v.

To qualify for standing, a claimant must present an injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendant's challenged behavior; and likely to be redressed by a favorable ruling. <i>Lujan, supra,</i> at 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p>The District Court held, and the parties do not dispute, that Davis possesses standing to challenge the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 319(b). When Davis filed suit, he had already declared his 2006 candidacy and had been forced by \u00a7 319(b) to disclose to his opponent that he intended to spend more than $350,000 in personal funds. At that time, Davis faced the imminent threat that he would have to follow up on that disclosure with further notifications after he in fact passed the $350,000 mark. Securing a declaration that \u00a7 319(b)'s requirements are unconstitutional and an injunction against their enforcement would have spared him from making those disclosures. That relief also would have removed the real threat that the FEC would pursue an enforcement action based on alleged violations of \u00a7 319(b) during his 2004 campaign. As a result, Davis possesses standing to challenge \u00a7 319(b)'s disclosure requirement.</p>\n<p>The fact that Davis has standing to challenge \u00a7 319(b) does not necessarily mean that he also has standing to challenge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2769</span> the scheme of contribution limitations that applies when \u00a7 319(a) comes into play. \"[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross.\" <i>Lewis v.

When Davis commenced this action, his opponent had not yet qualified for the asymmetrical limits, and later, when his opponent did qualify to take advantage of those limits, he chose not to do so. Accordingly, the FEC argues that \u00a7 319(a) did not cause Davis any injury.</p>\n<p>While the proof required to establish standing increases as the suit proceeds, see <i>Lujan, supra,</i> at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, the standing inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed. <i>Friends of Earth, supra,</i> at 180, 120 S.Ct. 693; <i>Arizonans for Official English, supra,</i> at 68, n. 22, 117 S.Ct. 1055. As noted above, the injury required for standing need not be actualized. A party facing prospective injury has standing to sue where the threatened injury is real, immediate, and direct. <i>Los Angeles v.

Davis faced such an injury from the operation of \u00a7 319(a) when he filed suit. Davis had declared his candidacy and his intent to spend more than $350,000 of personal funds in the general election campaign whose onset was rapidly approaching. Section 319(a) would shortly burden his expenditure of personal funds by allowing his opponent to receive contributions on more favorable terms, and there was no indication that his opponent would forgo that opportunity. Indeed, the record at summary judgment indicated that most candidates who had the opportunity to receive expanded contributions had done so. App. 89. In these circumstances, we conclude that Davis faced the requisite injury from \u00a7 319(a) when he filed suit and has standing to challenge that provision's asymmetrical contribution scheme.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The FEC's mootness argument also fails. This case closely resembles <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007). There, Wisconsin Right to Life (WRTL), a nonprofit, ideological advocacy corporation, wished to run radio and TV ads within 30 days of the 2004 Washington primary, contrary to a restriction imposed by BCRA. WRTL sued the FEC, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Although the suit was not resolved before the 2004 election, we rejected the FEC's claim of mootness, finding that the case \"fit comfortably within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2662. That \"exception applies where `(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Spencer v. Kemna,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118176\"><a href=\"/opinion/118176/spencer-v-kemna/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2770</span> In <i>WRTL,</i> \"despite BCRA's command that the cas[e] be expedited `to the greatest possible extent,'\" WRTL's claims could not reasonably be resolved before the election concluded. 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2662 (quoting \u00a7 403(a)(4), 116 Stat. 113, note following 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437h). Similarly, in this case despite BCRA's mandate to expedite and Davis' request that his case be resolved before the 2004 general election season commenced, Davis' case could not be resolved before the 2006 election concluded, demonstrating that his claims are capable of evading review.</p>\n<p>As to the second prong of the exception, even though WRTL raised an as-applied challenge, we found its suit capable of repetition where \"WRTL credibly claimed that it planned on running `materially similar' future\" ads subject to BCRA's prohibition and had, in fact, sought an injunction that would permit such an ad during the 2006 election. 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 2663 (some internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the FEC conceded in its brief that Davis' \u00a7 319(a) claim would be capable of repetition if Davis planned to self-finance another bid for a House seat. Brief for Appellee 14, 20-21, and n. 5. Davis subsequently made a public statement expressing his intent to do so. See Reply Brief 16 (citing Terreri, Democrat Davis Confirms He'll Run Again for Congress, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, Mar. 27, 2008, p. 5B). As a result, we are satisfied that Davis' facial challenge is not moot.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We turn to the merits of Davis' claim that the First Amendment is violated by the contribution limits that apply when \u00a7 319(a) comes into play. Under this scheme, as previously noted, when a candidate spends more than $350,000 in personal funds and creates what the statute apparently regards as a financial imbalance, that candidate's opponent may qualify to receive both larger individual contributions than would otherwise be allowed and unlimited coordinated party expenditures. Davis contends that \u00a7 319(a) unconstitutionally burdens his exercise of his First Amendment right to make unlimited expenditures of his personal funds because making expenditures that create the imbalance has the effect of enabling his opponent to raise more money and to use that money to finance speech that counteracts and thus diminishes the effectiveness of Davis' own speech.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>If \u00a7 319(a) simply raised the contribution limits for all candidates, Davis' argument would plainly fail. This Court has previously sustained the facial constitutionality of limits on discrete and aggregate individual contributions and on coordinated party expenditures. <i>Buckley v.

But we have held that limits that are too low cannot stand. <i>Randall, supra,</i> at 246-262, 126 S.Ct. 2479; <i>id.,</i> at 263, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>There is, however, no constitutional basis for attacking contribution limits on the ground that they are too high. Congress has no constitutional obligation to limit contributions at all; and if Congress concludes that allowing contributions of a certain amount does not create an undue risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption, a candidate who wishes to restrict an opponent's fundraising cannot argue that the Constitution demands that contributions be regulated more strictly. Consequently, if \u00a7 319(a)'s elevated contribution limits applied across the board, Davis would not have any basis for challenging those limits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Section 319(a), however, does not raise the contribution limits across the board. Rather, it raises the limits only for the non-self-financing candidate and does so only when the self-financing candidate's expenditure of personal funds causes the OPFA threshold to be exceeded. We have never upheld the constitutionality of a law that imposes different contribution limits for candidates who are competing against each other, and we agree with Davis that this scheme impermissibly burdens his First Amendment right to spend his own money for campaign speech.</p>\n<p>In <i>Buckley,</i> we soundly rejected a cap on a candidate's expenditure of personal funds to finance campaign speech. We held that a \"candidate . . . has a First Amendment right to engage in the discussion of public issues and vigorously and tirelessly to advocate his own election\" and that a cap on personal expenditures imposes \"a substantial,\" \"clea[r]\" and \"direc[t]\" restraint on that right. 424 U.S., at 52-53, 96 S.Ct. 612. We found that the cap at issue was not justified by \"[t]he primary governmental interest\" proffered in its defense, <i>i.e.,</i> \"the prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the political process.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 53, 96 S.Ct. 612. Far from preventing these evils, \"the use of personal funds,\" we observed, \"reduces the candidate's dependence on outside contributions and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse to which . . . contribution limitations are directed.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We also rejected the argument that the expenditure cap could be justified on the ground that it served \"[t]he ancillary interest in equalizing the relative financial resources of candidates competing for elective office.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 54, 96 S.Ct. 612. This putative interest, we noted, was \"clearly not sufficient to justify the . . . infringement of fundamental First Amendment rights.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p><i>Buckley</i>'s emphasis on the fundamental nature of the right to spend personal funds for campaign speech is instructive. While BCRA does not impose a cap on a candidate's expenditure of personal funds, it imposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises that First Amendment right. Section 319(a) requires a candidate to choose between the First Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2772</span> Many candidates who can afford to make large personal expenditures to support their campaigns may choose to do so despite \u00a7 319(a), but they must shoulder a special and potentially significant burden if they make that choice. See <i>Day v. Holahan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677807\"><a href=\"/opinion/677807/scott-day-treasurer-of-impace-mea-impace-mea-a-pol/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1356</span></a></span>, 1359-1360 (C.A.8 1994) (concluding that a Minnesota law that increased a candidate's expenditure limits and eligibility for public funds based on independent expenditures against her candidacy burdened the speech of those making the independent expenditures); Brief for Appellee 29 (conceding that \"[\u00a7]319 does impose some consequences on a candidate's choice to self-finance beyond certain amounts\"). Under \u00a7 319(a), the vigorous exercise of the right to use personal funds to finance campaign speech produces fundraising advantages for opponents in the competitive context of electoral politics. Cf. <i>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Util.

In <i>Buckley,</i> we held that Congress \"may engage in public financing of election campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure limitations\" even though we found an independent limit on overall campaign expenditures to be unconstitutional. 424 U.S., at 57, n. 65, 96 S.Ct. 612; see <i>id.,</i> at 54-58, 96 S.Ct. 612. But the choice involved in <i>Buckley</i> was quite different from the choice imposed by \u00a7 319(a). In <i>Buckley,</i> a candidate, by forgoing public financing, could retain the unfettered right to make unlimited personal expenditures. Here, \u00a7 319(a) does not provide any way in which a candidate can exercise that right without abridgment. Instead, a candidate who wishes to exercise that right has two choices: abide by a limit on personal expenditures or endure the burden that is placed on that right by the activation of a scheme of discriminatory contribution limits. The choice imposed by \u00a7 319(a) is not remotely parallel to that in <i>Buckley.</i></p>\n<p>Because \u00a7 319(a) imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech, that provision cannot stand unless it is \"justified by a compelling state interest,\" <i>Federal Election Comm'n v.

No such justification is present here.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2773</span> The burden imposed by \u00a7 319(a) on the expenditure of personal funds is not justified by any governmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption. The <i>Buckley</i> Court reasoned that reliance on personal funds <i>reduces</i> the threat of corruption, and therefore \u00a7 319(a), by discouraging use of personal funds, disserves the anticorruption interest. Similarly, given Congress' judgment that liberalized limits for non-self-financing candidates do not unduly imperil anticorruption interests, it is hard to imagine how the denial of liberalized limits to self-financing candidates can be regarded as serving anticorruption goals sufficiently to justify the resulting constitutional burden.</p>\n<p>The Government maintains that \u00a7 319(a)'s asymmetrical limits are justified because they \"level electoral opportunities for candidates of different personal wealth.\" Brief for Appellee 34. \"Congress enacted Section 319,\" the Government writes, \"to reduce <i>the natural advantage</i> that wealthy individuals possess in campaigns for federal office.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 33 (emphasis added). Our prior decisions, however, provide no support for the proposition that this is a legitimate government objective. See <i>Nixon,</i> 528 U.S., at 428, 120 S.Ct. 897 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (\"`[P]reventing corruption or the appearance of corruption are the only legitimate and compelling government interests thus far identified for restricting campaign finances'\" (quoting <i>National Conservative Political Action Comm., supra,</i> at 496-497, 105 S.Ct. 1459)); <i>Randall,</i> 548 U.S., at 268, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (noting \"the interests the Court has recognized as compelling, <i>i.e.,</i> the prevention of corruption or the appearance thereof\"). On the contrary, in <i>Buckley,</i> we held that \"[t]he interest in equalizing the financial resources of candidates\" did not provide a \"justification for restricting\" candidates' overall campaign expenditures, particularly where equalization \"might serve . . . to handicap a candidate who lacked substantial name recognition or exposure of his views before the start of the campaign.\" 424 U.S., at 56-57, 96 S.Ct. 612. We have similarly held that the interest \"in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections\" cannot support a cap on expenditures for \"express advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates,\" as \"the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612; see also <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 227, 124 S.Ct. 619 (noting, in assessing standing, that there is no legal right to have the same resources to influence the electoral process). Cf. <i>Austin, supra,</i> at 705, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (rejecting as \"antithetical to the First Amendment\" \"the notion that the government has a legitimate interest in restricting the quantity of speech to equalize the relative influence of speakers on elections\").</p>\n<p>The argument that a candidate's speech may be restricted in order to \"level electoral opportunities\" has ominous implications because it would permit Congress to arrogate the voters' authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates competing for office. See <i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 791-792, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (\"[T]he people in our democracy are entrusted with the responsibility for judging and evaluating the relative merits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2774</span> of conflicting arguments\" and \"may consider, in making their judgment, the source and credibility of the advocate\"). Different candidates have different strengths. Some are wealthy; others have wealthy supporters who are willing to make large contributions. Some are celebrities; some have the benefit of a well-known family name. Leveling electoral opportunities means making and implementing judgments about which strengths should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election. The Constitution, however, confers upon voters, not Congress, the power to choose the Members of the House of Representatives, Art. I, \u00a7 2, and it is a dangerous business for Congress to use the election laws to influence the voters' choices. See <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 791, n. 31, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (The \"[g]overnment is forbidden to assume the task of ultimate judgment, lest the people lose their ability to govern themselves\").</p>\n<p>Finally, the Government contends that \u00a7 319(a) is justified because it ameliorates the deleterious effects that result from the tight limits that federal election law places on individual campaign contributions and coordinated party expenditures. These limits, it is argued, make it harder for candidates who are not wealthy to raise funds and therefore provide a substantial advantage for wealthy candidates. Accordingly, \u00a7 319(a) can be seen, not as a legislative effort to interfere with the natural operation of the electoral process, but as a legislative effort to mitigate the untoward consequences of Congress' own handiwork and restore \"the normal relationship between a candidate's financial resources and the level of popular support for his candidacy.\" Brief for Appellee 33.</p>\n<p>Whatever the merits of this argument as an original matter, it is fundamentally at war with the analysis of expenditure and contributions limits that this Court adopted in <i>Buckley</i> and has applied in subsequent cases. The advantage that wealthy candidates now enjoy and that \u00a7 319(a) seeks to reduce is an advantage that flows directly from <i>Buckley</i>'s disparate treatment of expenditures and contributions. If that approach is sound\u0097and the Government does not urge us to hold otherwise<sup>[8]</sup>\u0097it is hard to see how undoing the consequences of that decision can be viewed as a compelling interest. If the normally applicable limits on individual contributions and coordinated party contributions are seriously distorting the electoral process, if they are feeding a \"public perception that wealthy people can buy seats in Congress,\" Brief for Appellee 34, and if those limits are not needed in order to combat corruption, then the obvious remedy is to raise or eliminate those limits. But the unprecedented step of imposing different contribution and coordinated party expenditure limits on candidates vying for the same seat is antithetical to the First Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The remaining issue that we must consider is the constitutionality of \u00a7 319(b)'s disclosure requirements. \"[W]e have repeatedly found that compelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2775</span> privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 64, 96 S.Ct. 612. As a result, we have closely scrutinized disclosure requirements, including requirements governing independent expenditures made to further individuals' political speech. <i>Id.,</i> at 75, 96 S.Ct. 612. To survive this scrutiny, significant encroachments \"cannot be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental interest.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 64, 96 S.Ct. 612. Instead, there must be \"a `relevant correlation' or `substantial relation' between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed,\" and the governmental interest \"must survive exacting scrutiny.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (footnotes omitted). That is, the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on First Amendment rights. <i>Id.,</i> at 68, 71, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\n<p>The \u00a7 319(b) disclosure requirements were designed to implement the asymmetrical contribution limits provided for in \u00a7 319(a), and as discussed above, \u00a7 319(a) violates the First Amendment. In light of that holding, the burden imposed by the \u00a7 319(b) requirements cannot be justified, and it follows that they too are unconstitutional.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>In sum, we hold that \u00a7\u00a7 319(a) and (b) violate the First Amendment.

To reduce that advantage, and to combat the perception that congressional seats are for sale to the highest bidder, Congress has relaxed the restrictions that would otherwise limit the amount of contributions that the opponents of self-funding candidates may accept from their supporters. In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, the District Court held that because the Millionaire's Amendment does not impose any burden whatsoever on the self-funding candidate's freedom to speak, it does not violate the First Amendment, and because it does no more than diminish the unequal strength of the self-funding candidate, it does not violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. I agree completely with the District Court's opinion, specifically its adherence to our decision in <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). While I would affirm for the reasons given by the District Court, I believe it appropriate to add these additional comments on the premise that underlies the constitutional prohibition on expenditure limitations, and on my reasons for concluding that the Millionaire's Amendment represents a modest, sensible, and plainly constitutional attempt by Congress to minimize the advantages enjoyed by wealthy candidates vis-\u00e1-vis those who must rely on the support of others to fund their pursuit of public office.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>According to the Court's decision in <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 18, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (<i>per curiam)</i><i>,</i> the vice that condemns expenditure limitations is that they \"impose direct quantity restrictions\" on political speech.<sup>[1]</sup> A limitation on the amount of money that a candidate is permitted to spend, the <i>Buckley</i> Court concluded, \"reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 19, 96 S.Ct. 612. Accordingly, the Court determined that any regulation of the quantity of money spent on campaigns for office ought to be viewed as a direct regulation of speech itself.</p>\n<p>Justice White firmly disagreed with the <i>Buckley</i> Court's holding on expenditure limitations, explaining that such regulations should be analyzed, not as direct restrictions on speech, but rather as akin to time, place, and manner regulations, which will be upheld \"so long as the purposes they serve are legitimate and sufficiently substantial.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264, 96 S.Ct. 612 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Although I did not participate in the Court's decision in <i>Buckley,</i> I have since been persuaded that Justice White\u0097who maintained his steadfast opposition to <i>Buckley</i>'s view of expenditure limits, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111370\"><a href=\"/opinion/111370/federal-election-commn-v-national-conservative-pol/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 507-512, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985) (dissenting opinion)\u0097was correct. Indeed, it was <i>Buckley</i> that represented a break from 65 years of established practice, as well as a probable departure from the views of the Framers of the relevant provisions of the Constitution itself. See <i>Randall v. Sorrell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145630\"><a href=\"/opinion/145630/randall-v-sorrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 274, 280-281, 126 S.Ct. 2479, 165 L.Ed.2d 482 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2779</span> In my view, a number of purposes, both legitimate and substantial, may justify the imposition of reasonable limitations on the expenditures permitted during the course of any single campaign. For one, such limitations would \"free candidates and their staffs from the interminable burden of fundraising.\" <i>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118057\"><a href=\"/opinion/118057/colorado-republican-federal-campaign-comm-v-federa/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></a></span>, 649, 116 S.Ct. 2309, 135 L.Ed.2d 795 (1996) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Moreover, the imposition of reasonable limitations would likely have the salutary effect of improving the quality of the exposition of ideas. After all, orderly debate is always more enlightening than a shouting match that awards points on the basis of decibels rather than reasons. Quantity limitations are commonplace in any number of other contexts in which high-value speech occurs. Litigants in this Court pressing issues of the utmost importance to the Nation are allowed only a fixed time for oral debate and a maximum number of pages for written argument. As listeners and as readers, judges need time to reflect on the merits of an issue; repetitious arguments are disfavored and are usually especially unpersuasive. Indeed, experts in the art of advocacy agree that \"lawyers go on for too long, and when they do it doesn't help their case.\"<sup>[2]</sup> It seems to me that Congress is entitled to make the judgment that voters deserve the same courtesy and the same opportunity to reflect as judges; flooding the airwaves with slogans and sound-bites may well do more to obscure the issues than to enlighten listeners. At least in the context of elections, the notion that rules limiting the quantity of speech are just as offensive to the First Amendment as rules limiting the content of speech is plainly incorrect.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>If, as I have come to believe, Congress could attempt to reduce the millionaire candidate's advantage by imposing reasonable limits on <i>all</i> candidates' expenditures, it follows <i>a fortiori</i> that the eminently reasonable scheme before us today survives constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Even accepting the <i>Buckley</i> Court's holding that expenditure limits as such are uniquely incompatible with the First Amendment, it remains my firm conviction that the Millionaire's Amendment represents a good-faith attempt by Congress to regulate, within the bounds of the Constitution, one particularly pernicious feature of many contemporary political campaigns.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>It cannot be gainsaid that the twin rationales at the heart of the Millionaire's Amendment\u0097reducing the importance of wealth as a criterion for public office and countering the perception that seats in the United States Congress are available for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2780</span> purchase by the wealthiest bidder\u0097are important Government interests. It is also evident that Congress, in enacting the provision, crafted a solution that was carefully tailored to those concerns. Davis insists, however, that the Government's interests are insufficiently weighty to justify what he believes are intrusions upon his rights under the First Amendment and the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment, and that, regardless of the strength of the justifications offered, Congress' solution is not sufficiently tailored to addressing the twin concerns it has identified. His arguments are unpersuasive on all counts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The thrust of Davis' First Amendment challenge is that by relaxing the contribution limits applicable to the opponent of a self-funding candidate, the Millionaire's Amendment punishes the candidate who chooses to self-fund. Extrapolating from the zero-sum nature of a political race, Davis insists that any benefit conferred upon a self-funder's opponent thereby works a detriment to the self-funding candidate. Accordingly, he argues, the scheme burdens the self-funding candidate's First Amendment right to speak freely and to participate fully in the political process.</p>\n<p>But Davis cannot show that the Millionaire's Amendment causes him\u0097or any other self-funding candidate\u0097any First Amendment injury whatsoever. The Millionaire's Amendment quiets no speech at all. On the contrary, it does no more than assist the opponent of a self-funding candidate in his attempts to make his voice heard; this amplification in no way mutes the voice of the millionaire, who remains able to speak as loud and as long as he likes in support of his campaign. Enhancing the speech of the millionaire's opponent, far from contravening the First Amendment, actually advances its core principles. If only one candidate can make himself heard, the voter's ability to make an informed choice is impaired.<sup>[5]</sup> And the self-funding candidate's ability to engage meaningfully in the political process is in no way undermined by this provision.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Even were we to credit Davis' view that the benefit conferred on the self-funding candidate's opponent burdens the self-funder's First Amendment rights, the purposes of the Amendment surely justify its effects. The Court is simply wrong when it suggests that the \"governmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2773, is the sole governmental interest sufficient to support campaign finance regulations. See <i>ante,</i> at 2773-2774. It is true, of course, that in upholding the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971's (FECA) limits on the size of contributions to political campaigns, the <i>Buckley</i> Court held that preventing both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption were Government interests of sufficient weight that they justified any infringement upon First Amendment freedoms that resulted from FECA's contribution <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2781</span> limits; the Court explained that, \"[t]o the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <i>quid pro quo</i> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined. . . . Of almost equal concern . . . is the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.\" 424 U.S., at 26-27, 96 S.Ct. 612. It is also true that the Court found that same interest insufficient to justify FECA's expenditure limitations. <i>Id.,</i> at 45-46, 52-56, 96 S.Ct. 612. But it does not follow that the <i>Buckley</i> Court concluded that <i>only</i> the interest in combating corruption and the appearance of corruption can justify congressional regulation of campaign financing.</p>\n<p>Indeed, we have long recognized the strength of an independent governmental interest in reducing both the influence of wealth on the outcomes of elections, and the appearance that wealth alone dictates those results. In case after case, we have held that statutes designed to protect against the undue influence of aggregations of wealth on the political process\u0097 where such statutes are responsive to the identified evil\u0097do not contravene the First Amendment. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Austin v.

FCC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107962\"><a href=\"/opinion/107962/red-lion-broadcasting-co-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, 390, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969) (upholding constitutionality of several components of the FCC's \"fair coverage\" requirements, and explaining that \"[i]t is the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail, rather than to countenance monopolization of that market\").</p>\n<p>Although the focus of our cases has been on aggregations of corporate rather than individual wealth, there is no reason that their logic\u0097specifically, their concerns about the corrosive and distorting effects of wealth on our political process\u0097is not equally applicable in the context of individual wealth. For, as we explained in <i>McConnell,</i> \"Congress' historical concern with the `political potentialities of wealth' and their `untoward consequences for the democratic process'. . . has long reached beyond corporate money,\" 540 U.S., at 116, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>United States v. Automobile Workers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105465\"><a href=\"/opinion/105465/united-states-v-automobile-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 577-578, 77 S.Ct. 529, 1 L.Ed.2d 563 (1957)).</p>\n<p>Minimizing the effect of concentrated wealth on our political process, and the concomitant interest in addressing the dangers that attend the perception that political power can be purchased, are, therefore, sufficiently weighty objectives to justify significant congressional action. And, not only was Congress motivated by proper and weighty goals in crafting the Millionaire's Amendment, the details of the scheme it devised are genuinely responsive to the problems it identified. The statute's \"Opposition Personal Funds Amount\" formula permits a self-funding candidate to spend as much money as he wishes, while <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2782</span> taking into account fundraising by the relevant campaigns; it thereby ensures that a candidate who happens to enjoy a significant fundraising advantage against a self-funding opponent does not reap a windfall as a result of the enhanced contribution limits. Rather, the self-funder's opponent may avail himself of the enhanced contribution limits only until parity is achieved, at which point he becomes again ineligible for contributions above the normal maximum. See \u00a7\u00a7 441a-1(a)(1)(A)-(C).</p>\n<p>It seems uncontroversial that \"there is no good reason to allow disparities in wealth to be translated into disparities in political power. A well-functioning democracy distinguishes between market processes of purchase and sale on the one hand and political processes of voting and reason-giving on the other.\" Sunstein, Political Equality and Unintended Consequences, 94 Colum. L.Rev. 1390 (1994). In light of that clear truth, Congress' carefully crafted attempt to reduce the distinct advantages enjoyed by wealthy candidates for congressional office does not offend the First Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Davis' equal protection argument, which the Court finds unnecessary to address, <i>ante,</i> at 2775, n. 9, fares no better. He claims that by permitting only the self-funder's opponent to avail himself of the increased contribution limits, the statute creates an unwarranted disparity between the self-funder and his opponent. But, as we explained in <i>McConnell,</i> \"Congress is fully entitled to consider . . . real-world differences . . . when crafting a system of campaign finance regulation.\" 540 U.S., at 188, 124 S.Ct. 619. And <i>Buckley</i> itself acknowledged, in the course of upholding FECA's public financing scheme, that \"the Constitution does not require Congress to treat all declared candidates the same.\" 424 U.S., at 97, 96 S.Ct. 612. It blinks reality to contend that the millionaire candidate is situated identically to a nonmillionaire opponent, and Congress was under no obligation to indulge any such fiction. Accordingly, Davis has failed to establish that he was deprived of the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In sum, I share Judge Wright's view that nothing in the Constitution \"prevents us, as a political community, from making certain modest but important changes in the kind of process we want for selecting our political leaders,\" Wright, Politics and the Constitution: Is Money Speech? 85 Yale L.J. 1001, 1005 (1976). In my judgment, the Millionaire's Amendment represents just such a change. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice BREYER joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>Agreeing with the Court that appellant Jack Davis has standing and that this case is not moot, I join Part II of the Court's opinion. On the merits, however, I part ways with the Court. The District Court's careful and persuasive opinion, as I see it, correctly concluded that the provisions challenged in this case are entirely consistent with <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> and all other relevant decisions of this Court. I therefore join Part II of Justice STEVENS' opinion.</p>\n<p>I resist joining other portions of Justice STEVENS' opinion, however, to the extent that they address <i>Buckley</i>'s distinction between expenditure and contribution limits and, correspondingly, <i>Buckley</i>'s holding that expenditure limits impose \"direct quantity restrictions on political communication,\" <i>id.,</i> at 18, 96 S.Ct. 612. Appellee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2783</span> Federal Election Commission has not asked us to overrule <i>Buckley</i>; consequently, the issue has not been briefed. Convinced that the challenged statute encounters no constitutional shoal under our precedents, I would leave reconsideration of <i>Buckley</i> for a later day and case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  All undesignated references in this opinion to 2 U.S.C. are to the 2006 edition.</p>\n<p>[2]  These limits are adjusted for inflation every two years. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(c).</p>\n<p>[3]  BCRA \u00a7 319(a) is set out in an Appendix to this opinion. Although what we refer to as \u00a7\u00a7 319(a) and (b) are actually \u00a7 315A(a) and (b) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which were added to that Act by BCRA \u00a7 319(a), we follow the convention of the parties in making reference to \u00a7\u00a7 319(a) and (b).</p>\n<p>[4]  BCRA \u00a7 304 similarly regulates self-financed Senate bids. 116 Stat. 97, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(i).</p>\n<p>[5]  The OPFA is calculated as follows. For each candidate, expenditures of personal funds are added to 50% of the funds raised for the election at issue measured at designated dates in the year preceding the election. The resulting figures are compared, and if the difference is greater than $350,000, the asymmetrical limits take effect. See \u00a7\u00a7 441a-1(a)(1), (2).</p>\n<p>[6]  In light of this conclusion, we need not decide whether the threat of an FEC enforcement action for alleged 2004 violations would be sufficient to keep this controversy alive.</p>\n<p>[7]  Even if \u00a7 319(a) were characterized as a limit on contributions rather than expenditures, it is doubtful whether it would survive. A contribution limit involving \"`\"significant interference\" with associational rights'\" must be \"`\"closely drawn\"'\" to serve a \"`sufficiently important interest.'\" <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 136, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). For the reasons explained <i>infra,</i> at 2773-2774, the chief interest proffered in support of the asymmetrical contribution scheme\u0097leveling electoral opportunities\u0097cannot justify the infringement of First Amendment interests.</p>\n<p>[8]  Justice STEVENS would revisit and reject <i>Buckley</i>'s treatment of expenditure limits. <i>Post,</i> at ___-___ (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). The Government has not urged us to take that step, and in any event, Justice STEVENS' proposal is unsound. He suggests that restricting the quantity of campaign speech would improve the quality of that speech, but it would be dangerous for the Government to regulate core political speech for the asserted purpose of improving that speech. And in any event, there is no reason to suppose that restricting the quantity of campaign speech would have the desired effect.</p>\n<p>[9]  Because we conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 319(a) and (b) violate the First Amendment, we need not address Davis' claim that they also violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p>[1]  The <i>Buckley</i> Court invalidated two different types of limits on campaign expenditures: limits on the amount of \"personal or family resources\" a candidate could spend on his own campaign, 424 U.S., at 51-54, 96 S.Ct. 612, and overall limits on campaign expenditures, <i>id.,</i> at 54-60, 96 S.Ct. 612. In my judgment the Court was mistaken in striking down both of those provisions; I treat them together here.</p>\n<p>[2]  Brust, A Voice for the Write: Tips on Making Your Case From a Supremely Reliable Source, 94 A.B.A.J. 37 (May 2008) (interview with Justice SCALIA and Bryan Garner).</p>\n<p>[3]  The Court is of course correct that \"it would be dangerous for the Government to regulate core political speech for the asserted purpose of improving that speech.\" <i>Ante,</i> at ___, n. 8. But campaign expenditures are not <i>themselves</i> \"core political speech\"; they merely may <i>enable</i> such speech (as well as its repetition <i>ad nauseam</i>). In my judgment, it is simply not the case that the First Amendment \"provides the same measure of protection\" to the use of money to enable speech as it does to speech itself. <i>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118335\"><a href=\"/opinion/118335/nixon-v-shrink-missouri-government-pac/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span>, 398, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000) (STEVENS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>[4]  I note at the outset of this discussion, however, that I agree with the Court's conclusion that Davis has standing to challenge \u00a7\u00a7 319(a) and (b), and that the case is not moot; I therefore join Part II of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>[5]  \"In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential, for the identities of those who are elected will inevitably shape the course that we follow as a nation.\" <i>Buckley v.
