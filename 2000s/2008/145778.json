Argued February 19, 2008—Decided June 26, 2008*\nUnder the Mobile-Sierra doctrine, the Federal Energy Regulatory\n Commission (FERC) must presume that the electricity rate set in a\n freely negotiated wholesale-energy contract meets the “just and rea-\n sonable” requirement of the Federal Power Act (FPA), see 16 U. S. C.\n §824d(a), and the presumption may be overcome only if FERC con-\n cludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest. See\n United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332;\n FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348. Under FERC’s cur-\n rent regulatory regime, a wholesale electricity seller may file a “mar-\n ket-based” tariff, which simply states that the utility will enter into\n freely negotiated contracts with purchasers. Those contracts are not\n filed with FERC before they go into effect. In 2000 and 2001, there\n was a dramatic increase in the price of electricity in the western\n United States. As a result, respondents entered into long-term con-\n tracts with petitioners that locked in rates that were very high by\n historical standards. Respondents subsequently asked FERC to mod-\n ify the contracts, contending that the rates should not be presumed\n just and reasonable under Mobile-Sierra. The Administrative Law\n Judge concluded that the presumption applied and that the contracts\n did not seriously harm the public interest. FERC affirmed, but the\n Ninth Circuit remanded. The court held that contract rates are pre-\n\n——————\n   * Together with No. 06–1462, American Electric Power Service Corp.\net al. v.

The court alter-\n    natively held that there is a different standard for overcoming the\n    Mobile-Sierra presumption when a purchaser challenges a contract:\n    whether the contract exceeds a “zone of reasonableness.”\nHeld:\n    1. The Commission was required to apply the Mobile-Sierra pre-\n sumption in evaluating the contracts here. Sierra held that a rate set\n out in a contract must be presumed to be just and reasonable absent\n serious harm to the public interest, regardless of when the contract is\n challenged. FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. 380, distinguished. Also,\n the Ninth Circuit’s rule requiring FERC to ask whether a contract\n was formed in an environment of market “dysfunction” is not sup-\n ported by this Court’s cases and plainly undermines the role of con-\n tracts in the FPA’s statutory scheme. Pp. 15–19.\n    2. The Ninth Circuit’s “zone of reasonableness” test fails to accord\n an adequate level of protection to contracts. The standard for a\n buyer’s rate-increase challenge must be the same, generally, as the\n standard for a seller’s challenge: The contract rate must seriously\n harm the public interest. The Ninth Circuit misread Sierra in hold-\n ing that the standard for evaluating a high-rate challenge and setting\n aside a contract rate is whether consumers’ electricity bills were\n higher than they would have been had the contract rates equaled\n “marginal cost.” Under the Mobile-Sierra presumption, setting aside\n a contract rate requires a finding of “unequivocal public necessity,”\n Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 822, or “extraordinary\n circumstances,” Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, 453 U. S. 571,\n 582. Pp. 19–23.\n    3. The judgment below is nonetheless affirmed on alternative\n grounds, based on two defects in FERC’s analysis. First, the analysis\n was flawed or incomplete to the extent FERC looked simply to\n whether consumers’ rates increased immediately upon conclusion of\n the relevant contracts, rather than determining whether the con-\n tracts imposed an excessive burden “down the line,” relative to the\n rates consumers could have obtained (but for the contracts) after\n elimination of the dysfunctional market. Sierra’s “excessive burden”\n on customers was the current burden, not just the burden imposed at\n the contract’s outset. See 350 U. S., at 355. Second, it is unclear\n from FERC’s orders whether it found respondents’ evidence inade-\n quate to support their claim that petitioners engaged in unlawful\n market manipulation that altered the playing field for contract nego-\n tiations. In such a case, the Commission should not presume that a\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

Like fraud and duress, unlawful\n  market activity directly affecting contract negotiations eliminates the\n  premise on which the Mobile-Sierra presumption rests: that the con-\n  tract rates are the product of fair, arms-length negotiations. On re-\n  mand, FERC should amplify or clarify its findings on these two\n  points.

See 16 U. S. C.\n§824 et seq. Modeled on the Interstate Commerce Act, the\nFPA requires regulated utilities to file compilations of\ntheir rate schedules, or “tariffs,” with the Commission,\nand to provide service to electricity purchasers on the\nterms and prices there set forth. §824d(c). Utilities wish­\ning to change their tariffs must notify the Commission 60\ndays before the change is to go into effect. §824d(d).\nUnlike the Interstate Commerce Act, however, the FPA\nalso permits utilities to set rates with individual electric­\nity purchasers through bilateral contracts. §824d(c), (d).\nAs we have explained elsewhere, the FPA “departed from\nthe scheme of purely tariff-based regulation and acknowl­\nedged that contracts between commercial buyers and\nsellers could be used in ratesetting.” Verizon Communica­\ntions Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 479 (2002). Like tariffs,\ncontracts must be filed with the Commission before they\ngo into effect. 16 U. S. C. §824d(c), (d).\n   The FPA requires all wholesale-electricity rates to be\n“just and reasonable.” §824d(a). When a utility files a\nnew rate with the Commission, through a change to its\ntariff or a new contract, the Commission may suspend the\nrate for up to five months while it investigates whether\n\n——————\n  1 We also use “Commission” to refer to the Federal Power Commis­\n\nsion, FERC’s predecessor.\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

The Commis­\nsion may, however, decline to investigate and permit the\nrate to go into effect—which does not amount to a deter­\nmination that the rate is “just and reasonable.” See 18\nCFR §35.4 (2007). After a rate goes into effect, whether or\nnot the Commission deemed it just and reasonable when\nfiled, the Commission may conclude, in response to a\ncomplaint or on its own motion, that the rate is not just\nand reasonable and replace it with a lawful rate. 16\nU. S. C. §824e(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V).\n   The statutory requirement that rates be “just and rea­\nsonable” is obviously incapable of precise judicial defini­\ntion, and we afford great deference to the Commission in\nits rate decisions. See FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. 380,\n389 (1974); Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747,\n767 (1968). We have repeatedly emphasized that the\nCommission is not bound to any one ratemaking formula.\nSee Mobil Oil Exploration & Producing Southeast, Inc. v.\nUnited Distribution Cos., 498 U. S. 211, 224 (1991); Per­\nmian Basin, supra, at 776–777. But FERC must choose a\nmethod that entails an appropriate “balancing of the\ninvestor and the consumer interests.” FPC v. Hope Natu­\nral Gas Co., 320 U. S. 591, 603 (1944). In exercising its\nbroad discretion, the Commission traditionally reviewed\nand set tariff rates under the “cost-of-service” method,\nwhich ensures that a seller of electricity recovers its costs\nplus a rate of return sufficient to attract necessary capital.\nSee J. McGrew, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n152, 160–161 (2003) (hereinafter McGrew).\n   In two cases decided on the same day in 1956, we ad­\ndressed the authority of the Commission to modify rates\nset bilaterally by contract rather than unilaterally by\ntariff. In United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service\nCorp., 350 U. S. 332, we rejected a natural-gas utility’s\nargument that the Natural Gas Act’s requirement that it\nfile all new rates with the Commission authorized it to\n4     MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC \n\n          UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nabrogate a lawful contract with a purchaser simply by\nfiling a new tariff, see id., at 336–337. The filing require­\nment, we explained, is merely a precondition to changing a\nrate, not an authorization to change rates in violation of a\nlawful contract (i.e., a contract that sets a just and reason­\nable rate). See id., at 339–344.\n   In FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348, 352–\n353 (1956), we applied the holding of Mobile to the analo­\ngous provisions of the FPA, concluding that the complain­\ning utility could not supersede a contract rate simply by\nfiling a new tariff. In Sierra, however, the Commission\nhad concluded not only (contrary to our holding) that the\nnewly filed tariff superseded the contract, but also that\nthe contract rate itself was not just and reasonable, “solely\nbecause it yield[ed] less than a fair return on the net\ninvested capital” of the utility. Id., at 355. Thus, we were\nconfronted with the question of how the Commission may\nevaluate whether a contract rate is just and reasonable.\n   We answered that question in the following way:\n    “[T]he Commission’s conclusion appears on its face to\n    be based on an erroneous standard. . . . [W]hile it may\n    be that the Commission may not normally impose\n    upon a public utility a rate which would produce less\n    than a fair return, it does not follow that the public\n    utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate af­\n    fording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it\n    is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bar­\n    gain. . . . In such circumstances the sole concern of the\n    Commission would seem to be whether the rate is so\n    low as to adversely affect the public interest—as\n    where it might impair the financial ability of the pub­\n    lic utility to continue its service, cast upon other con­\n    sumers an excessive burden, or be unduly discrimina­\n    tory.” Id., at 354–355 (emphasis deleted).\nAs we said in a later case, “[t]he regulatory system created\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nby the [FPA] is premised on contractual agreements vol­\nuntarily devised by the regulated companies; it contem­\nplates abrogation of these agreements only in circum­\nstances of unequivocal public necessity.” Permian Basin,\nsupra, at 822.\n   Over the past 50 years, decisions of this Court and the\nCourts of Appeals have refined the Mobile-Sierra pre­\nsumption to allow greater freedom of contract. In United\nGas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas and Water Div.,\n358 U. S. 103, 110–113 (1958), we held that parties could\ncontract out of the Mobile-Sierra presumption by specify­\ning in their contracts that a new rate filed with the Com­\nmission would supersede the contract rate. Courts of\nAppeals have held that contracting parties may also agree\nto a middle option between Mobile-Sierra and Memphis\nLight: A contract that does not allow the seller to super­\nsede the contract rate by filing a new rate may nonethe­\nless permit the Commission to set aside the contract rate\nif it results in an unfair rate of return, not just if it vio­\nlates the public interest. See, e.g., Papago Tribal Util.\nAuth. v. FERC, 723 F. 2d 950, 953 (CADC 1983); Louisi­\nana Power & Light Co. v. FERC, 587 F. 2d 671, 675–676\n(CA5 1979). Thus, as the Mobile-Sierra doctrine has\ndeveloped, regulated parties have retained broad author­\nity to specify whether FERC can review a contract rate\nsolely for whether it violates the public interest or also for\nwhether it results in an unfair rate of return. But the\nMobile-Sierra presumption remains the default rule.\n   Moreover, even though the challenges in Mobile and\nSierra were brought by sellers, lower courts have con­\ncluded that the Mobile-Sierra presumption also applies\nwhere a purchaser, rather than a seller, asks FERC to\nmodify a contract. See Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. FERC,\n210 F. 3d 403, 404–405, 409–410 (CADC 2000); Boston\nEdison Co. v. FERC, 856 F. 2d 361, 372 (CA1 1988). This\nCourt has seemingly blessed that conclusion, explaining\n6     MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC \n\n          UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthat under the FPA, “[w]hen commercial parties . . . avail\nthemselves of rate agreements, the principal regulatory\nresponsibility [is] not to relieve a contracting party of an\nunreasonable rate.” Verizon, 535 U. S., at 479 (citing\nSierra, supra, at 355).\n   Over the years, the Commission began to refer to the two\nmodes of review—one with the Mobile-Sierra presumption\nand the other without—as the “public interest standard”\nand the “just and reasonable standard.” See, e.g., Southern\nCo. Servs., Inc. Gulf States Utils. Co. v. Southern Co.\nServs., Inc., 39 FERC ¶63,026, pp. 65,134, 65,141 (1987).\nDecisions from the Courts of Appeals did likewise. See,\ne.g., Kansas Cities v. FERC, 723 F. 2d 82, 87–88 (CADC\n1983); Northeast Utils. Serv. Co. v. FERC, 993 F. 2d 937,\n961 (CA1 1993). We do not take this nomenclature to\nstand for the obviously indefensible proposition that a\nstandard different from the statutory just-and-reasonable\nstandard applies to contract rates. Rather, the term “pub­\nlic interest standard” refers to the differing application of\nthat just-and-reasonable standard to contract rates. See\nPhiladelphia Elec. Co., 58 F. P. C. 88, 90 (1977). (It would\nbe less confusing to adopt the Solicitor General’s terminol­\nogy, referring to the two differing applications of the just­\nand-reasonable standard as the “ordinary” “just and rea­\nsonable standard” and the “public interest standard.” See\nReply Brief for Respondent FERC 6.)\n                              B\n\n     Recent FERC Innovations; Market-Based Tariffs \n\n  In recent decades, the Commission has undertaken an\nambitious program of market-based reforms. Part of the\nimpetus for those changes was technological evolution.\nHistorically, electric utilities had been vertically inte­\ngrated monopolies. For a particular geographic area, a\nsingle utility would control the generation of electricity, its\ntransmission, and its distribution to consumers. See\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMidwest ISO Transmission Owners v. FERC, 373 F. 3d\n1361, 1363 (CADC 2004). Since the 1970’s, however,\nengineering innovations have lowered the cost of generat­\ning electricity and transmitting it over long distances,\nenabling new entrants to challenge the regional generat­\ning monopolies of traditional utilities. See generally New\nYork v. FERC, 535 U. S. 1, 7–8 (2002); Public Util. Dist.\nNo. 1 of Snohomish Cty. v. FERC, 272 F. 3d 607, 610\n(CADC 2001).\n   To take advantage of these changes, the Commission\nhas attempted to break down regulatory and economic\nbarriers that hinder a free market in wholesale electricity.\nIt has sought to promote competition in those areas of the\nindustry amenable to competition, such as the segment\nthat generates electric power, while ensuring that the\nsegment of the industry characterized by natural monop­\noly—namely, the transmission grid that conveys the gen­\nerated electricity—cannot exert monopolistic influence\nover other areas. See New York, supra, at 9–10; Snoho­\nmish, supra. To that end, FERC required in Order No.\n888 that each transmission provider offer transmission\nservice to all customers on an equal basis by filing an\n“open access transmission tariff.” Promoting Wholesale\nCompetition Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory\nTransmission Services by Public Utilities, 61 Fed. Reg.\n21540 (1996); see New York, supra, at 10–12. That re­\nquirement prevents the utilities that own the grid from\noffering more favorable transmission terms to their own\naffiliates and thereby extending their monopoly power to\nother areas of the industry.\n   To further pry open the wholesale-electricity market\nand to reduce technical inefficiencies caused when differ­\nent utilities operate different portions of the grid inde­\npendently, the Commission has encouraged transmission\nproviders to establish “Regional Transmission Organiza­\ntions”—entities to which transmission providers would\n8     MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n          UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntransfer operational control of their facilities for the pur­\npose of efficient coordination. Order No. 2000, 65 Fed.\nReg. 810, 811–812 (2000); see Midwest ISO, supra, at\n1364. It has encouraged the management of those entities\nby “Independent System Operators,” not-for-profit entities\nthat operate transmission facilities in a nondiscriminatory\nmanner. See Midwest ISO, supra. In addition to coordi­\nnating transmission service, Regional Transmission Or­\nganizations perform other functions, such as running\nauction markets for electricity sales and offering contracts\nfor hedging against potential grid congestion. See Blum­\nsack, Measuring the Benefits and Costs of Regional Elec­\ntric Grid Integration, 28 Energy L. J. 147, 147 (2007).\n   Against this backdrop of technological change and mar-\nket-based reforms, the Commission over the past two\ndecades has begun to permit sellers of wholesale electric­\nity to file “market-based” tariffs. These tariffs, instead of\nsetting forth rate schedules or rate-fixing contracts, simply\nstate that the seller will enter into freely negotiated con­\ntracts with purchasers.      See generally Market-Based\nRates For Wholesale Sales Of Electric Energy, Capacity\nAnd Ancillary Services By Public Utilities, Order No. 697,\n72 Fed. Reg. 39904 (2007) (hereinafter Market-Based\nRates); McGrew 160–167. FERC does not subject the\ncontracts entered into under these tariffs (as it subjected\ntraditional wholesale-power contracts) to §824d’s require­\nment of immediate filing, apparently on the theory that\nthe requirement has been satisfied by the initial filing of\nthe market-based tariffs themselves. See Brief for Re­\nspondent FERC 28–29 (hereinafter Brief for FERC).\n   FERC will grant approval of a market-based tariff only\nif a utility demonstrates that it lacks or has adequately\nmitigated market power, lacks the capacity to erect other\nbarriers to entry, and has avoided giving preferences to its\naffiliates. See Market-Based Rates, ¶7, 72 Fed. Reg. 39907.\nIn addition to the initial authorization of a market-based\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

FERC, 383\nF. 3d 1006, 1013 (CA9 2004). It must also demonstrate\nevery four months that it still lacks or has adequately\nmitigated market power. See ibid. If FERC determines\nfrom these filings that a seller has reattained market\npower, it may revoke the authority prospectively. See\nMarket-Based Rates, ¶5, 72 Fed. Reg. 39906. And if the\nCommission finds that a seller has violated its Regional\nTransmission Organization’s market rules, its tariff, or\nCommission orders, the Commission may take appropriate\nremedial action, such as ordering refunds, requiring dis­\ngorgement of profits, and imposing civil penalties. See\nibid.\n   Both the Ninth Circuit and the D. C. Circuit have gen­\nerally approved FERC’s scheme of market-based tariffs.\nSee Lockyer, supra, at 1011–1013; Louisiana Energy &\nPower Auth. v. FERC, 141 F. 3d 364, 365 (CADC 1998).\nWe have not hitherto approved, and express no opinion\ntoday, on the lawfulness of the market-based-tariff sys­\ntem, which is not one of the issues before us. It suffices for\nthe present cases to recognize that when a seller files a\nmarket-based tariff, purchasers no longer have the option\nof buying electricity at a rate set by tariff and contracts no\nlonger need to be filed with FERC (and subjected to its\ninvestigatory power) before going into effect.\n                             C\n\n          California’s Electricity Regulation and \n\n                     Its Consequences \n\n   In 1996, California enacted Assembly Bill 1890 (AB\n1890), which massively restructured the California elec­\ntricity market. See 1996 Cal. Stat. ch. 854 (codified at Cal.\nPub. Util. Code Ann. §§330–398.5 (West 2004 and Supp.\n10    MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n          UTIL. DIST.

Annual Survey of Am.\nLaw 155, 172–185 (2001) (hereinafter Cudahy). The bill\ntransferred operational control of the transmission facili­\nties of California’s three largest investor-owned utilities to\nan Independent Service Operator (Cal-ISO). See Pacific\nGas & Elec. Co. v. FERC, 464 F. 3d 861, 864 (CA9 2006).\nIt also established the California Power Exchange\n(CalPX), a nonprofit entity that operated a short-term\nmarket—or “spot market”—for electricity. The bill re­\nquired California’s three largest investor-owned utilities to\ndivest most of their electricity-generation facilities. It\nthen required those utilities to purchase and sell the bulk\nof their electricity from and to the CalPX’s spot market,\npermitting only limited leeway for them to enter into long-\nterm contracts. See Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish\nCty. v. FERC, 471 F. 3d 1053, 1068 (CA9 2006) (case\nbelow).\n   In 1997, FERC approved the Cal-ISO as consistent with\nthe requirements for an Independent Service Operator\nestablished in Order No. 888. FERC also approved the\nCalPX and the investor-owned utilities’ authority to make\nsales at market-based rates in the CalPX, finding that, in\nlight of the divesture of their generation units and other\nconditions imposed under the restructuring plan, those\nutilities had adequately mitigated their market power.\nSee Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 81 FERC ¶61,122, pp. 61,435,\n61,435–61,436, 61,537–61,548 (1997).\n   The CalPX opened for business in March 1998. In the\nsummer of 1999, it expanded to include an auction for\nsales of electricity under “forward contracts”—contracts in\nwhich sellers promise to deliver electricity more than one\nday in the future (sometimes many years). But the par­\nticipation of California’s large investor-owned utilities in\nthat forward market was limited because, as we have said,\nAB 1890 strictly capped the amount of power that they\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

See 471 F. 3d,\nat 1068.\n  That diminishment of the role of long-term contracts in\nthe California electricity market turned out to be one of\nthe seeds of an energy crisis. In the summer of 2000, the\nprice of electricity in the CalPX’s spot market jumped\ndramatically—more than fifteenfold. See ibid. The in­\ncrease was the result of a combination of natural, eco­\nnomic, and regulatory factors: “flawed market rules; in­\nadequate addition of generating facilities in the preceding\nyears; a drop in available hydropower due to drought\nconditions; a rupture of a major pipeline supplying natural\ngas into California; strong growth in the economy and in\nelectricity demand; unusually high temperatures; an\nincrease in unplanned outages of extremely old generating\nfacilities; and market manipulation.” CAlifornians for\nRenewable Energy, Inc. v. Sellers of Energy and Ancillary\nServs., 119 FERC ¶61,058, pp. 61,243, 61,246 (2007).\nBecause California’s investor-owned utilities had for the\nmost part been forbidden to obtain their power through\nlong-term contracts, the turmoil in the spot market hit\nthem hard. See Cudahy 174. The high prices led to roll­\ning blackouts and saddled utilities with mounting debt.\n  In late 2000, the Commission took action. A central\nplank of its emergency effort was to eliminate the utilities’\nreliance on the CalPX’s spot market and to shift their\npurchases to the forward market. To that end, FERC\nabolished the requirement that investor-owned utilities\npurchase and sell all power through the CalPX and en­\ncouraged them to enter into long-term contracts. See San\nDiego Gas & Electric Co. v. Sellers of Energy and Ancillary\nServs., 93 FERC ¶61,294, pp. 61,980, 61,982 (2000); see\nalso 471 F. 3d, at 1069. The Commission also put price\ncaps on wholesale electricity. See San Diego Gas & Elec.\nCo. v. Sellers of Energy and Ancillary Servs., 95 FERC\n¶61,418, p. 62,545 (2001). By June 2001, electricity prices\n12    MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n          UTIL. DIST.

Id., at 62,456.\n                              D\n\n                   Genesis of These Cases \n\n  The principal respondents in these cases are western\nutilities that purchased power under long-term contracts\nduring that tumultuous period in 2000 and 2001. Al­\nthough they are not located in California, the high prices\nin California spilled over into other Western States. See\n471 F. 3d, at 1069. Petitioners are the sellers that entered\ninto the contracts with respondents.\n  The contracts between the parties included rates that\nwere very high by historical standards. For example,\nrespondent Snohomish signed a 9-year contract to pur­\nchase electricity from petitioner Morgan Stanley at a rate\nof $105/megawatt hour (MWh), whereas prices in the\nPacific Northwest have historically averaged $24/MWh.\nThe contract prices were substantially lower, however,\nthan the prices that Snohomish would have paid in the\nspot market during the energy crisis, when prices peaked\nat $3,300/MWh. See id., at 1069–1070.\n  After the crisis had passed, buyer’s remorse set in and\nrespondents asked FERC to modify the contracts. They\ncontended that the rates in the contracts should not be\npresumed to be just and reasonable under Mobile-Sierra\nbecause, given the sellers’ market-based tariffs, the\ncontracts had never been initially approved by the Com­\nmission without the presumption. See Nevada Power Co.\nv. Enron Power Marketing, Inc., 103 FERC ¶61,353,\npp. 62,382, 62,387 (2003). Respondents also argued that\ncontract modification was warranted even under the Mo­\nbile-Sierra presumption because the contract rates were so\nhigh that they violated the public interest. See 103 FERC,\nat 62,383, 62,387–62,395.\n  In a preliminary order, the Commission instructed the\nAdministrative Law Judge (ALJ) to consider 12 different\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfactors in deciding whether the presumption could be\novercome for the contracts, such as the terms of the con­\ntracts, the available alternatives at the time of sale, the\nrelationship of the rates to Commission benchmarks, the\neffect of the contracts on the financial health of the pur­\nchasers, and the impact of contract modification on na­\ntional energy markets. After a hearing, the ALJ con­\ncluded that the Mobile-Sierra presumption should apply to\nthe contracts and that the contracts did not seriously\nharm the public interest. In fact, according to the ALJ,\neven if the Mobile-Sierra presumption did not apply,\nrespondents would not be entitled to have the contracts\nmodified. 103 FERC, at 62,390–62,394.\n   Between the ALJ’s decision and the Commission’s rul­\ning, the Commission’s staff issued a report (Staff Report)\nconcluding that unlawful activities of various sellers in the\nspot market had affected prices in the forward market.\nSee id., at 62,396. Respondents raised the report at oral\nargument before the Commission, and some of them ar­\ngued that petitioners “were unlawfully manipulating\nmarket prices, thereby engaging in fraud and deception in\nviolation of their market-based rate tariffs.” Ibid. Peti­\ntioners contended, however, that the Staff Report demon­\nstrated only a correlation between rates in the spot and\nforward markets, not a causal connection. See ibid.\n   FERC affirmed the ALJ. The Commission first held\nthat the Mobile-Sierra presumption did apply to the con­\ntracts at issue. Although agreeing with respondents that\nthe presumption applies only where FERC has had an\ninitial opportunity to review a contract rate, the Commis­\nsion relied on the somewhat metaphysical ground that the\ngrant of market-based authority to petitioners qualified as\nthat initial opportunity. See 103 FERC, at 62,388–62,389.\nThe Commission then held that respondents could not\novercome the Mobile-Sierra presumption. It recognized\nthat the Staff Report had “found that spot market distor­\n14     MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n           UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY.\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions flowed through to forward power prices,” 103 FERC,\nat 62,396–62,397, but concluded that this finding, even if\ntrue, was not “determinative” because:\n     “a finding that the unjust and unreasonable spot mar­\n     ket caused forward bilateral prices to be unjust and\n     unreasonable would be relevant to contract modifica­\n     tion only where there is a ‘just and reasonable’ stan­\n     dard of review. . . . Under the ‘public interest’ stan­\n     dard, to justify contract modification it is not enough\n     to show that forward prices became unjust and unrea­\n     sonable due to the impact of spot market dysfunctions;\n     it must be shown that the rates, terms and conditions\n     are contrary to the public interest.” Id., at 62,397.\n   The Commission determined that under the factors\nidentified in Sierra, as well as under a totality-of-the­\ncircumstances test, respondents had not demonstrated\nthat the contracts threatened the public interest. See 103\nFERC, at 62,397–62,399. On rehearing, respondents\nreiterated their complaints, including their charge that\n“their contracts were the product of market manipulation\nby Enron, Morgan Stanley and other [sellers].” 105 FERC\n¶61,185, pp. 61,979, 61,989 (2003). The Commission an­\nswered that there was “no evidence to support a finding of\nmarket manipulation that specifically affected the con­\ntracts at issue.” Ibid.\n   Respondents filed petitions for review in the Ninth\nCircuit, which granted the petitions and remanded to the\nCommission, finding two flaws in the Commission’s analy­\nsis.2 First, the court agreed with respondents that rates\nset by contract (whether pursuant to a market-based tariff\n——————\n  2 In a holding not challenged before this Court, the Ninth Circuit con­\n\ncluded that the contracts at issue did not contain “Memphis clause[s],”\n471 F. 3d 1053, 1079 (2006) (citing United Gas Pipe Line Co. v.

S. ____ (2008)         15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor not) are presumptively reasonable only where FERC\nhas had an initial opportunity to review the contracts\nwithout applying the Mobile-Sierra presumption. To\nsatisfy that prerequisite under the market-based tariff\nregime, the court said, the Commission must promptly\nreview the terms of contracts after their formation and\nmust modify those that do not appear to be just and rea­\nsonable when evaluated without the Mobile-Sierra pre­\nsumption (rather than merely revoking market-based\nauthority prospectively but leaving pre-existing contracts\nintact). See 471 F. 3d, at 1075–1077, 1079–1085. This\ninitial review must include an inquiry into “the market\nconditions in which the contracts at issue were formed,”\nand market “dysfunction” is a ground for finding a con­\ntract not to be just and reasonable. Id., at 1085–1087.\nSecond, the Ninth Circuit held that even assuming that\nthe Mobile-Sierra presumption applied, the standard for\novercoming that presumption is different for a purchaser’s\nchallenge to a contract, namely, whether the contract rate\nexceeds a “zone of reasonableness.” 471 F. 3d, at 1088–\n1090.\n  We granted certiorari. See 551 U. S. ___ (2007).\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n        Application of Mobile-Sierra Presumption to \n\n         Contracts Concluded under Market-Based \n\n                       Rate Authority \n\n  As noted earlier, the FERC order under review here\nagreed with the Ninth Circuit’s premise that the Commis­\nsion must have an initial opportunity to review a contract\nwithout the Mobile-Sierra presumption, but maintained\nthat the authorization for market-based rate authority\nqualified as that initial review. Before this Court, how­\never, FERC changes its tune, arguing that there is no such\nprerequisite—or at least that FERC could reasonably\n16    MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n          UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nconclude so and therefore that Chevron deference is in\norder. See Brief for FERC 20–21, 33–34; Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837 (1984). We will not uphold a discretionary agency\ndecision where the agency has offered a justification in\ncourt different from what it provided in its opinion. See\nSEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. 80, 94–95 (1943). But\nFERC has lucked out: The Chenery doctrine has no appli­\ncation to these cases, because we conclude that the Com­\nmission was required, under our decision in Sierra, to\napply the Mobile-Sierra presumption in its evaluation of\nthe contracts here. That it provided a different rationale\nfor the necessary result is no cause for upsetting its ruling.\n“To remand would be an idle and useless formality. Chen­\nery does not require that we convert judicial review of\nagency action into a ping-pong game.” NLRB v. Wyman-\nGordon Co., 394 U. S. 759, 766–767, n. 6 (1969) (plurality\nopinion).\n   We are in broad agreement with the Ninth Circuit on a\ncentral premise: There is only one statutory standard for\nassessing wholesale electricity rates, whether set by con­\ntract or tariff—the just-and-reasonable standard. The\nplain text of the FPA states that “[a]ll rates . . . shall be\njust and reasonable.” 16 U. S. C. §824d(a); see also\n§824e(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V). But we disagree with the\nNinth Circuit’s interpretation of Sierra as requiring (con­\ntrary to the statute) that the Commission apply the stan­\ndard differently, depending on when a contract rate is\nchallenged. In the Ninth Circuit’s view, Sierra was prem­\nised on the idea that “as long as the rate was just and\nreasonable when the contract was formed, there would be\na presumption. . .that the reasonableness continued\nthroughout the term of the contract.” 471 F. 3d, at 1077.\nIn other words, so long as the Commission concludes\n(either after a hearing or by allowing a rate to go into\neffect) that a contract rate is just and reasonable when\n                       Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                       17\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\ninitially filed, the rate will be presumed just and reason­\nable in future proceedings.\n   That is a misreading of Sierra. Sierra was grounded in\nthe commonsense notion that “[i]n wholesale markets, the\nparty charging the rate and the party charged [are] often\nsophisticated businesses enjoying presumptively equal\nbargaining power, who could be expected to negotiate a\n‘just and reasonable’ rate as between the two of them.”\nVerizon, 535 U. S., at 479. Therefore, only when the mu­\ntually agreed-upon contract rate seriously harms the\nconsuming public may the Commission declare it not to be\njust and reasonable.3 Sierra thus provided a definition of\nwhat it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and-reasonable\nstandard in the contract context—a definition that applies\nregardless of when the contract is reviewed. The Ninth\nCircuit, by contrast, essentially read Sierra “as the equiva­\nlent of an estoppel doctrine,” whereby an initial Commis­\nsion opportunity for review prevents the Commission from\nmodifying the rates absent serious future harm to the\npublic interest. Tewksbury & Lim, Applying the Mobile-\nSierra Doctrine to Market-Based Rate Contracts, 26 En­\nergy L. J. 437, 457–458 (2005). But Sierra said nothing of\nthe sort. And given that the Commission’s passive per­\nmission for a rate to go into effect does not constitute a\nfinding that the rate is just and reasonable, it would be\nodd to treat that initial “opportunity for review” as curtail­\ning later challenges.\n   The Ninth Circuit found support for its prerequisite in\nour decision in FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. 380 (1974).\nIn that case, we warned that the Commission’s attempt to\nrely solely on market forces to evaluate rates charged by\n\n——————\n  3 We  do not say, as the dissent alleges, post, at 7 (opinion of\nSTEVENS, J.), that the public interest is not also relevant in a challenge\nto unilaterally set rates. But it is the “ ‘sole concern’ ” in a contract case.\nSee FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348, 355 (1956).\n18   MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n         UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsmall natural-gas producers was inconsistent with the\nNatural Gas Act’s insistence that rates be just and rea­\nsonable. See id., at 397. The Ninth Circuit apparently\ntook this to mean that all initially filed contracts must be\nsubject to review without the Mobile-Sierra presumption.\nBut Texaco had nothing to do with that doctrine. It held\nthat the Commission had improperly implemented a\nscheme of total deregulation by applying no standard of\nreview at all to small-producer rates. See 417 U. S., at\n395–397. It did not cast doubt on the proposition that in a\nproper regulatory scheme, the ordinary mode for evaluat­\ning contractually set rates is to look to whether the rates\nseriously harm the public interest, not to whether they are\nunfair to one of the parties that voluntarily assented to\nthe contract. Cf. id., at 391, n. 4.\n   Nor do we agree with the Ninth Circuit that FERC must\ninquire into whether a contract was formed in an envi­\nronment of market “dysfunction” before applying the\nMobile-Sierra presumption. Markets are not perfect, and\none of the reasons that parties enter into wholesale-power\ncontracts is precisely to hedge against the volatility that\nmarket imperfections produce. That is why one of the\nCommission’s responses to the energy crisis was to remove\nregulatory barriers to long-term contracts. It would be a\nperverse rule that rendered contracts less likely to be\nenforced when there is volatility in the market. (Such a\nrule would come into play, after all, only when a contract\nformed in a period of “dysfunction” did not significantly\nharm the consuming public, since contracts that seriously\nharm the public should be set aside even under the Mo­\nbile-Sierra presumption.) By enabling sophisticated par­\nties who weathered market turmoil by entering long-term\ncontracts to renounce those contracts once the storm has\npassed, the Ninth Circuit’s holding would reduce the\nincentive to conclude such contracts in the future. Such a\nrule has no support in our case law and plainly under­\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmines the role of contracts in the FPA’s statutory scheme.\n   To be sure, FERC has ample authority to set aside a\ncontract where there is unfair dealing at the contract\nformation stage—for instance, if it finds traditional\ngrounds for the abrogation of the contract such as fraud or\nduress. See 103 FERC, at 62,399–62,400 (“[T]here is no\nevidence of unfairness, bad faith, or duress in the original\nnegotiations”). In addition, if the “dysfunctional” market\nconditions under which the contract was formed were\ncaused by illegal action of one of the parties, FERC should\nnot apply the Mobile-Sierra presumption. See Part III,\ninfra. But the mere fact that the market is imperfect, or\neven chaotic, is no reason to undermine the stabilizing\nforce of contracts that the FPA embraced as an alternative\nto “purely tariff-based regulation.” Verizon, 535 U. S., at\n479. We may add that evaluating market “dysfunction” is\na very difficult and highly speculative task—not one that\nthe FPA would likely require the agency to engage in\nbefore holding sophisticated parties to their bargains.\n   We reiterate that we do not address the lawfulness of\nFERC’s market-based-rates scheme, which assuredly has\nits critics. But any needed revision in that scheme is\nproperly addressed in a challenge to the scheme itself, not\nthrough a disfigurement of the venerable Mobile-Sierra\ndoctrine. We hold only that FERC may abrogate a valid\ncontract only if it harms the public interest.\n                              B\n\n             Application of “Excessive Burden”\n\n            Exception to High-Rate Challenges\n\n  We turn now to the Ninth Circuit’s second holding: that\na “zone of reasonableness” test should be used to evaluate\na buyer’s challenge that a rate is too high. In our view\nthat fails to accord an adequate level of protection to\ncontracts. The standard for a buyer’s challenge must be\nthe same, generally speaking, as the standard for a seller’s\n20        MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n              UTIL. DIST.

That is the standard that the Commission\napplied in the proceedings below.\n   We are again in agreement with the Ninth Circuit on a\nstarting premise: It is clear that the three factors we\nidentified in Sierra—“where [a rate] might impair the\nfinancial ability of the public utility to continue its service,\ncast upon other consumers an excessive burden, or be\nunduly discriminatory,” 350 U. S., at 355—are not all\nprecisely applicable to the high-rate challenge of a pur­\nchaser (where, for example, the relevant question is not\nwhether “other customers” [of the utility] would be exces­\nsively burdened, but whether any customers of the pur­\nchaser would be); and that those three factors are in any\nevent not the exclusive components of the public interest.\nIn its decision below, the Commission recognized both\nthese realities. See 103 FERC, at 62,397 (“Nevada Com­\npanies failed to show that the contract terms at issue\nimpose an excessive burden on their customers” (emphasis\nadded)); id., at 62,398 (“The record also demonstrates that\nSnohomish presented no evidence that its contract with\nMorgan Stanley adversely affected Snohomish or its rate­\npayers” (emphasis added)); id., at 62,398–62,399 (evaluat­\ning the “totality of circumstances”); see also Brief for\nFERC 41–42.4\n   Where we disagree with the Ninth Circuit is on the\n——————\n  4 Thedissent criticizes the Commission’s decision because it took into\naccount under the heading “totality of the circumstances” only the\ncircumstances of the contract formation, not “circumstances exogenous\nto contract negotiations, including natural disasters and market\nmanipulation by entities not parties to the challenged contract.” Post,\nat 13. Those considerations are relevant to whether the contracts\nimpose an “excessive burden” on consumers relative to what they would\nhave paid absent the contracts. It is precisely our uncertainty whether\nthe Commission considered those “circumstances exogenous to contract\nnegotiations,” discussed in Part III of our opinion, that causes us to\napprove the remand to FERC.\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

The\nNinth Circuit took “excessive burden” to mean merely the\nburden caused when one set of consumers is forced to pay\nabove marginal cost to compensate for below-marginal­\n\n——————\n   5 Elsewhere the Ninth Circuit softened this standard somewhat, say­\n\ning that “[e]ven if a particular rate exceeds marginal cost . . . it may\nstill be within this reasonable range—or ‘zone of reasonableness’—if\nthat higher-than-cost-based price results from normal market forces\nand is part of a general trend toward rates that do reflect cost.” 471\nF. 3d, at 1089. We are not sure (and we think no one can be sure)\nprecisely what this means. It has no basis in our opinions, and is in\nany event wrong because its point of departure (the general principle\nthat rates cannot exceed marginal cost) contradicts Mobile-Sierra.\n   The Ninth Circuit purported to find support for its “zone of reason­\nableness” test in the case law of the District of Columbia Circuit. But\nthe cited case stands only for the proposition that a market-based\nscheme must assure that market forces will, “over the long pull,” cause\nrates to approximate marginal cost. Interstate Natural Gas Assn. of\nAm. v. FERC, 285 F. 3d 18, 31 (2002). Nowhere does the opinion\nsuggest that the standard for reforming a particular contract validly\nentered into under a market-based scheme is whether the rates ap­\nproximate marginal cost.\n   By the same token, our approval of FERC’s decision not to set pro­\nspective area rates solely with reference to pre-existing contract prices,\nPermian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 792–793 (1968), does\nnot support, as the dissent thinks, post, at 8, n. 2, the view that the\nstandard for abrogating an existing, valid contract is anything less than\nthe Mobile-Sierra standard. That is the standard Permian Basin\napplied when actually confronted with the issue of contract modifica­\ntion. See 390 U. S., at 781–784, 821–822.\n22    MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n          UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\ncost rates charged other consumers. See 471 F. 3d, at\n1088. And it proceeded to apply a similar notion of “exces­\nsive burden” to high-rate challenges (where all the burden\nof the above-marginal-cost contract rate falls on the pur­\nchaser’s own customers, and does not affect the customers\nof third parties). Id., at 1089. That is a misreading of\nSierra and our later cases. A presumption of validity that\ndisappears when the rate is above marginal cost is no\npresumption of validity at all, but a reinstitution of cost-\nbased rather than contract-based regulation. We have\nsaid that, under the Mobile-Sierra presumption, setting\naside a contract rate requires a finding of “unequivocal\npublic necessity,” Permian Basin, 390 U. S., at 822, or\n“extraordinary circumstances,” Arkansas Louisiana Gas\nCo. v. Hall, 453 U. S. 571, 582 (1981). In no way can these\ndescriptions be thought to refer to the mere exceeding of\nmarginal cost.\n    The Ninth Circuit’s standard would give short shrift to\nthe important role of contracts in the FPA, as reflected in\nour decision in Sierra, and would threaten to inject more\nvolatility into the electricity market by undermining a key\nsource of stability. The FPA recognizes that contract\nstability ultimately benefits consumers, even if short-term\nrates for a subset of the public might be high by historical\nstandards—which is why it permits rates to be set by\ncontract and not just by tariff. As the Commission has\nrecently put it, its “first and foremost duty is to protect\nconsumers from unjust and unreasonable rates; however,\n. . . uncertainties regarding rate stability and contract\nsanctity can have a chilling effect on investments and a\nseller’s willingness to enter into long-term contracts and\nthis, in turn, can harm customers in the long run.” Mar-\nket-Based Rates, ¶6, 72 Fed.

Assuming that FERC even ventured to under­\ntake such an analysis, rather than reverting to the ancien\nrégime of cost-of-service ratesetting, the regulatory costs\nwould be enormous. We think that the FPA intended to\nreserve the Commission’s contract-abrogation power for\nthose extraordinary circumstances where the public will\nbe severely harmed.6\n                          III\n    Defects in FERC’s Analysis Supporting Remand\n  Despite our significant disagreement with the Ninth\n——————\n  6 The dissent claims that we have misread the FPA because its provi­\nsions “do not distinguish between rates set unilaterally by tariff and\nrates set bilaterally by contract.” Post, at 2. But the dissent’s interpre­\ntation, whatever plausibility it has as an original matter, cannot be\nsquared with Sierra, which plainly distinguished between unilaterally\nand bilaterally set rates, and said that the only relevant consideration\nfor the Commission in the latter case is whether the public interest is\nharmed. And the circumstances identified in Sierra as implicating the\npublic interest refer to something more than a small dent in the con­\nsumer’s pocket, which is why our subsequent cases have described the\nstandard as a high one.\n  At the end of the day, the dissent simply argues against the settled\nunderstanding of the FPA that has prevailed in this Court, lower\ncourts, and the Commission for half a century. Although the dissent is\ncorrect that we have never used the phrase “Mobile-Sierra doctrine” in\nour cases, that is probably because the understanding of it was so\nuniform that no circuit split concerning its meaning arose until the\nNinth Circuit’s erroneous decision in these cases. If one searches the\nCommission’s reports, over 600 decisions since 2000 alone have cited\nthe doctrine, see Brief for Electric Power Supply Association et al. as\nAmici Curiae 15, and the Courts of Appeals have used the term “Mo­\nbile-Sierra doctrine” (or “Sierra-Mobile” doctrine) over 75 times since\n1974. If there were ever a context where long-settled understanding\nshould be honored it is here, where a statutory decision (subject to\nrevision by Congress) has been understood the same way for many\nyears by lower courts, by this Court, by the federal agency the statute\ngoverns, and hence surely by the private actors trying to observe the\nlaw.\n24    MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n          UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit, we find two errors in the Commission’s analysis,\nand we therefore affirm the judgment below on alternative\ngrounds.\n   First, it appears, as the Ninth Circuit concluded, see 471\nF. 3d, at 1090, that the Commission may have looked\nsimply to whether consumers’ rates increased immediately\nupon the relevant contracts’ going into effect, rather than\ndetermining whether the contracts imposed an excessive\nburden on consumers “down the line,” relative to the rates\nthey could have obtained (but for the contracts) after\nelimination of the dysfunctional market. For example, the\nCommission concluded that two of the respondents would\nexperience “rate decreases of approximately 20 percent for\nretail service” during the period covered by the contracts.\n103 FERC, at 62,397. But the baseline for that computa­\ntion was the rate they were paying before the contracts\nwent into effect. That disparity is certainly a relevant\nconsideration; but so is the disparity between the contract\nrate and the rates consumers would have paid (but for the\ncontracts) further down the line, when the open market\nwas no longer dysfunctional. That disparity, past a cer­\ntain point, could amount to an “excessive burden.” That is\nwhat was contemplated by Sierra, which involved a chal­\nlenge 5 years into a 15-year contract. The “excessive\nburden” on other customers to which the opinion referred\nwas assuredly the current burden, and not only the bur­\nden imposed at the very outset of the contract. See 350\nU. S., at 355. The “unequivocal public necessity” that\njustifies overriding the Mobile-Sierra presumption does\nnot disappear as a factor once the contract enters into\nforce. Thus, FERC’s analysis on this point was flawed—or\nat least incomplete. As the Ninth Circuit put it, “[i]t is\nentirely possible that rates had increased so high during\nthe energy crises because of dysfunction in the spot mar­\nket that, even with the acknowledged decrease in rates,\nconsumers still paid more under the forward contracts\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthan they otherwise would have.” 471 F. 3d, at 1090. If\nthat is so, and if that increase is so great that, even taking\ninto account the desirability of fostering market-\nstabilizing long-term contracts, the rates impose an exces­\nsive burden on consumers or otherwise seriously harm the\npublic interest, the rates must be disallowed.\n   Second, respondents alleged before FERC that some of\nthe petitioners in these cases had engaged in market\nmanipulation in the spot market. See, e.g., 105 FERC, at\n61,989 (“Snohomish and Nevada Companies argue that\ntheir contracts were the product of market manipulation\nby Enron, Morgan Stanley and other Respondents, which,\nas established by the Commission Staff, engaged in mar­\nket manipulation”). The Staff Report concluded, as we\nhave said, that the abnormally high prices in the spot\nmarket during the energy crisis influenced the terms of\ncontracts in the forward market. But the Commission\ndismissed the relevance of the Staff Report on the ground\nthat it had not demonstrated that forward market prices\nwere so high as to overcome the Mobile-Sierra presump­\ntion. We conclude, however, that if it is clear that one\nparty to a contract engaged in such extensive unlawful\nmarket manipulation as to alter the playing field for con­\ntract negotiations, the Commission should not presume\nthat the contract is just and reasonable. Like fraud and\nduress, unlawful market activity that directly affects\ncontract negotiations eliminates the premise on which the\nMobile-Sierra presumption rests: that the contract rates\nare the product of fair, arms-length negotiations. The\nmere fact that the unlawful activity occurred in a different\n(but related) market does not automatically establish that\nit had no effect upon the contract—especially given the\nStaff Report’s (unsurprising) finding that high prices in\nthe one market produced high prices in the other. We are\nunable to determine from the Commission’s orders\nwhether it found the evidence inadequate to support the\nclaim that respondents’ alleged unlawful activities af­\n26   MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n         UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY.\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nfected the contracts at issue here. It said in its order on\nrehearing, 105 FERC, at 61,989, that “[w]e . . . found no\nevidence to support a finding of market manipulation [by\nrespondents] that specifically affected the contracts at\nissue.” But perhaps that must be read in light of the\nCommission’s above described rejection of the Staff Report\non the ground that high spot market prices caused by\nmanipulation are irrelevant unless the forward market\nprices fail the Mobile-Sierra standard; and in light of the\nstatement in its initial order, in apparent response to the\nclaim of spot-market manipulation by respondents, 103\nFERC, at 62,397, that “a finding that the unjust and\nunreasonable spot market prices caused forward bilateral\nprices to be unjust and unreasonable would be relevant to\ncontract modification only where there is a ‘just and rea­\nsonable’ standard of review.”\n   We emphasize that the mere fact of a party’s engaging\nin unlawful activity in the spot market does not deprive its\nforward contracts of the benefit of the Mobile-Sierra pre­\nsumption. There is no reason why FERC should be able to\nabrogate a contract on these grounds without finding a\ncausal connection between unlawful activity and the\ncontract rate. Where, however, causality has been estab­\nlished, the Mobile-Sierra presumption should not apply.\n   On remand, the Commission should amplify or clarify\nits findings on these two points. The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals is affirmed, and the cases are remanded\nfor proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE BREYER took no part in\nthe consideration or decision of these cases.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

C. §791a et seq., wholesale electricity prices are\nestablished in the first instance by public utilities, either\nvia tariffs or in contracts with purchasers. §824d(c).\nWhether set by tariff or contract, all rates must be filed\nwith the Commission. See ibid. Section 205(a) of the FPA\nprovides, “All rates and charges . . . shall be just and\nreasonable, and any such rate or charge that is not just\nand reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.” 16\nU. S. C. §824d(a). Pursuant to §206(a), if FERC deter-\nmines “that any rate . . . or that any rule, regulation,\npractice, or contract affect[ing] such rate . . . is unjust [or]\nunreasonable . . . , the Commission shall determine the\njust and reasonable rate, . . . rule, regulation, practice, or\ncontract to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall\nfix the same by order.” 16 U. S. C. §824e(a). These provi-\nsions distinguish between the rate-setting roles of utilities\n(which initially set rates) and the Commission (which may\noverride utility-set rates that are not just and reasonable),\nbut they do not distinguish between rates set unilaterally\nby tariff and rates set bilaterally by contract. However the\nutility sets its prices, the standard of review is the same—\nrates must be just and reasonable.\n   The Court purports to acknowledge that “[t]here is only\none statutory standard for assessing wholesale electricity\nrates, whether set by contract or tariff—the just-and-\nreasonable standard.” Ante, at 16. Unlike rates set by\ntariff, however, the Court holds that any “freely negoti-\nated” contract rate is presumptively just and reasonable\nunless it “seriously harms” the public interest. Ante, at 1.\nAccording to the Court, this presumption represents a\n“differing application of [the] just-and-reasonable stan-\ndard,” but not a different standard altogether. Ante, at 6.\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)             3\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nI disagree. There is no significant difference between\nrequiring a heightened showing to overcome an otherwise\nconclusive presumption and imposing a heightened stan-\ndard of review. I agree that applying a separate standard\nof review to contract rates is “obviously indefensible,”\nibid., but that is also true with respect to the Court’s\npresumption.\n  Even if the “Mobile-Sierra presumption” were not tan-\ntamount to a separate standard, nothing in the statute\nmandates “differing application” of the statutory standard\nto rates set by contract. Ibid. Section 206(a) of the FPA\nprovides, “without qualification or exception,” that FERC\nmay replace any unjust or unreasonable contract with a\nlawful contract. Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390\nU. S. 747, 783–784 (1968) (construing identical language\nin the Natural Gas Act, 15 U. S. C. §717d(a)). The statute\ndoes not say anything about a mandatory presumption for\ncontracts, much less define the burden of proof for over-\ncoming it or delineate the circumstances for its nonappli-\ncation. Cf. ante, at 1, 19. Nor does the statute prohibit\nFERC from considering marginal cost when reviewing\nrates set by contract. Cf. ante, at 20–22, and n. 5.\n  If Congress had intended to impose such detailed con-\nstraints on the Commission’s authority to review contract\nrates, it would have done so itself in the FPA. Congress\ninstead used the general words “just and reasonable”\nbecause it wanted to give FERC, not the courts, wide\nlatitude in setting policy. As we explained in Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 843–844 (1984):\n       “ ‘The power of an administrative agency to admin-\n    ister a congressionally created . . . program necessar-\n    ily requires the formulation of policy and the making\n    of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by\n    Congress.’ Morton v.

Such legislative regulations are given\n    controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capri-\n    cious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. Some-\n    times the legislative delegation to an agency on a par-\n    ticular question is implicit rather than explicit. In\n    such a case, a court may not substitute its own con-\n    struction of a statutory provision for a reasonable in-\n    terpretation made by the administrator of an agency.”\n    (Footnote omitted.)\n  Consistent with this understanding of administrative\nlaw, our cases interpreting the FPA have invariably “em-\nphasized that courts are without authority to set aside any\nrate adopted by the Commission which is within a ‘zone of\nreasonableness.’ ” Permian Basin, 390 U. S., at 797. But\nsee ante, at 19 (asserting that “a ‘zone of reasonableness’\ntest . . . fails to accord an adequate level of protection to\ncontracts”). This deference makes eminent sense because\n“rate-making agencies are not bound to the service of any\nsingle regulatory formula; they are permitted, unless their\nstatutory authority otherwise plainly indicates, ‘to make\nthe pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by\nparticular circumstances.’ ” Permian Basin, 390 U. S., at\n776–777. Despite paying lipservice to this principle, see\nante, at 3, the Court binds the Commission to a rigid\nformula of the Court’s own making.\n  Having found no statutory text that supports its vision\nof the Mobile-Sierra doctrine, the Court invokes the “im-\nportant role of contracts in the FPA.” Ante, at 22. But\ncontracts play an “important role” in the FPA only insofar\nas the statute “departed from the scheme of purely tariff-\nbased regulation.” Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC,\n535 U.

The Court\nvacated and remanded on the ground that the Commission\nhad applied an erroneous standard. “[W]hile it may be\nthat the Commission may not normally impose upon a\npublic utility a rate which would produce less than a fair\nreturn,” the Court reasoned, “it does not follow that the\npublic utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate\naffording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it is\nentitled to be relieved of its improvident bargain.” Id., at\n355. When the seller has agreed to a rate that it later\nchallenges as too low, “the sole concern of the Commission\nwould seem to be whether the rate is so low as to ad-\nversely affect the public interest—as where it might im-\npair the financial ability of the public utility to continue\nits service, cast upon other consumers an excessive bur-\nden, or be unduly discriminatory.” Ibid. The Court fur-\nther elaborated on what it meant by the “public interest”:\n    “That the purpose of the power given the Commission\n    by §206(a) is the protection of the public interest, as\n    distinguished from the private interests of the utili-\n    ties, is evidenced by the recital in §201 of the Act that\n    the scheme of regulation imposed ‘is necessary in the\n    public interest.’ When §206(a) is read in the light of\n    this purpose, it is clear that a contract may not be\n    said to be either ‘unjust’ or ‘unreasonable’ simply be-\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

S. C. §824(a),\nwhether a rate is “just and reasonable” is measured\nagainst the public interest, not the private interests of\nregulated sellers. Contrary to the opinion of the Court,\nsee ante, at 23, n. 6, Sierra instructs that the public inter-\nest is the touchstone for just-and-reasonable review of all\nrates, not just contract rates. Sierra drew a distinction\nbetween the Commission’s authority to impose low rates\non utilities and its authority to abrogate low rates agreed\nto by utilities because these actions impact the public\ninterest differently, not because the public interest gov-\nerns rates set bilaterally but not rates set unilaterally.\nWhen the Commission imposes rates that afford less than\na fair return, it compromises the public’s interest in at-\ntracting necessary capital. The impact is different, how-\never, if a utility has agreed to a low rate because investors\nrecognize that the utility, not the regulator, is responsible\nfor the unattractive rate of return.\n  Sierra used “public interest” as shorthand for the inter-\nest of consumers in paying “ ‘the lowest possible reason-\nable rate consistent with the maintenance of adequate\nservice in the public interest.’ ” Permian Basin, 390 U. S.,\nat 793 (quoting Atlantic Refining Co. v. Public Serv.\nComm’n of N. Y., 360 U. S. 378, 388 (1959)). Whereas\nhigh rates directly implicate this interest, low rates do so\nonly indirectly, such as when the rate is so low that it\n“might impair the financial ability of the public utility to\ncontinue its service, cast upon other consumers an exces-\nsive burden, or be unduly discriminatory.” Sierra, 350\nU. S., at 355. Nothing in Sierra purports to mandate a\n“serious harm” standard of review, or to require any as-\nsumption that high rates and low rates impose symmetric\nburdens on the public interest. Cf. ante, at 19–20. As we\n8      MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC \n\n           UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY. \n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting \n\n\nlater explained in FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. 380, 399\n(1974), the Commission cannot ignore even “a small dent\nin the consumer’s pocket” because “the Act makes unlaw-\nful all rates which are not just and reasonable, and does\nnot say a little unlawfulness is permitted.”\n  Brushing aside the text of the FPA, as well as the hold-\nings in Mobile and Sierra themselves, the Court cherry\npicks language from Verizon, Arkla, and Permian Basin.\nBoth Verizon and Arkla mentioned the Mobile-Sierra line\nof cases only in passing, and neither case had anything to\ndo with just-and-reasonable review of rates. See Verizon,\n535 U. S., at 479; Arkla, 453 U. S. 571, 582 (1981). Fur-\nthermore, the statement in Permian Basin about “un-\nequivocal public necessity,” 390 U. S., at 822, speaks to the\ndifficulty of establishing injury to the public interest in the\ncontext of a low-rate challenge, not a high-rate challenge.2\n——————\n   2 The Court repeatedly quotes the following snippet from the 75-page\n\nopinion in Permian Basin: “The regulatory system created by the Act is\npremised on contractual agreements voluntarily devised by the regu-\nlated companies; it contemplates abrogation of these agreements only\nin circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.” 390 U. S., at 822\n(cited ante, at 5, 22, 24). Like FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350\nU. S. 348 (1956), however, Permian Basin made this statement in the\ncourse of rejecting a low-rate challenge. Read in context, the Court’s\nreference to “unequivocal public necessity” is a loose restatement of\nSierra, which required “evidence of injury to the public interest,” and\nwhich underscored how rarely a utility will be able to demonstrate that\na “contract price is so ‘low as to adversely affect the public interest.’ ”\n390 U. S., at 820–821 (quoting Sierra, 350 U. S., at 355). The Court’s\nexpansive reading of the “unequivocal public necessity” statement\ncannot be squared with Permian Basin’s discussion of the Commission’s\nauthority to review rates set by contract: “Although the Natural Gas\nAct is premised upon a continuing system of private contracting, the\nCommission has plenary authority to limit or to proscribe contractual\narrangements that contravene the relevant public interests.” 390 U. S.,\nat 784 (citation omitted). Nor can it be reconciled with Permian Basin’s\nrejection of the producers’ arguments (1) that the Commission “wrongly\ninvalidated existing contracts” by imposing a ceiling on rates, see id., at\n781–784, and (2) that the Commission was compelled to adopt contract\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

Of course, “the desirability of fostering\nmarket-stabilizing long-term contracts,” ante, at 25, plays\ninto the public interest insofar as the “Commission’s re-\nsponsibilities include the protection of future, as well as\npresent, consumer interests,” Permian Basin, 390 U. S., at\n798; see also United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light,\nGas and Water Div., 358 U. S. 103, 113 (1958) (“It seems\nplain that Congress . . . was not only expressing its convic-\ntion that the public interest requires the protection of\nconsumers from excessive prices for natural gas, but was\nalso manifesting its concern for the legitimate interests of\nnatural gas companies in whose financial stability the gas-\nconsuming public has a vital stake”). But under the FPA,\nCongress has charged FERC, not the courts, with balanc-\ning the short-term and long-term interests of consumers.\nSee Permian Basin, 390 U. S., at 792 (“The court’s respon-\nsibility is not to supplant the Commission’s balance of\nthese interests with one more nearly to its liking, but\ninstead to assure itself that the Commission has given\nreasoned consideration to each of the pertinent factors”).\n   Moreover, not even FERC has the authority to endorse\nthe rule announced by the Court today.

It follows, then, that “the Commission\nlacks the authority to place exclusive reliance on market\nprices.” Texaco, 417 U. S., at 400; see also id., at 399 (“In\nsubjecting producers to regulation because of anticompeti-\ntive conditions in the industry, Congress could not have\nassumed that ‘just and reasonable’ rates could conclu-\nsively be determined by reference to market price”). For\nthis reason, we have already rejected the policy rationale\nproffered by the Court today:\n     “It may be, as some economists have persuasively ar-\n     gued, that the assumptions of the 1930’s about the\n     competitive structure of the natural gas industry, if\n     true then, are no longer true today. It may also be\n     that control of prices in this industry, in a time of\n     shortage, if such there be, is counterproductive to the\n     interests of the consumer in increasing the production\n     of natural gas.

This is not to say that the Commis-\nsion should abrogate any contract that increases rates, but\nto underscore that the agency is “obliged at each step of its\nregulatory process to assess the requirements of the broad\npublic interests entrusted to its protection by Congress.”\nPermian Basin, 390 U. S., at 791.\n                              IV\n   Even if, as the Court holds today, the “Mobile-Sierra\npresumption” is merely a “differing application” of the\nstatutory just-and-reasonable standard, FERC’s orders\nmust be set aside because they were not decided on this\nbasis.\n   The FERC orders repeatedly aver that the agency is\napplying a “public interest” standard different from and\ndistinctly more demanding than the statutory standard.\nSee, e.g., App. 1198a (“[T]he burden of showing that a\ncontract is contrary to the public interest is a higher bur-\nden than showing that a contract is not just and reason-\nable. . . . The fact that a contract may be found to be un-\njust and unreasonable under [§§205 and 206] does not in\nand of itself demonstrate that the contract is contrary to\nthe public interest under the Supreme Court cases”).\nIndeed, the Commission’s misunderstanding of our cases\nis so egregious that the sellers, concerned that the orders\nwould be overturned, asked the Commission for “clarifica-\ntion that the public interest standard of review does not\nauthorize unjust and unreasonable rates.” Id., at 1506a,\n1567a. FERC clarified as follows:\n    “[I]f rates . . . become unjust and unreasonable and\n    the contract at issue is subject to the Mobile-Sierra\n    standard of review, the Commission under court\n    precedent may not change the contract simply because\n    it is no longer just and reasonable.

S., at 396, in these cases FERC refused outright to\napply that standard.3\n   In addition to misrepresenting FERC’s understanding of\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine as a presumption rather than a\nseparate standard, the Court overstates the extent to\nwhich FERC considered the lawfulness of the rates. The\nCourt recognizes, as it must, that the three factors identi-\nfied in Sierra are neither exclusive nor “precisely applica-\nble to the high-rate challenge of a purchaser.” See ante, at\n20; Brief for Respondent FERC 41–42. Although FERC\napplied what it termed the “Sierra Three-Prong Test,”\nApp. 1276a, the Court contends the agency did not err\nbecause it also evaluated the “ ‘totality of the circum-\nstances,’ ” see ante, at 20. But FERC’s totality-of-the-\ncircumstances review was infected by its misapprehension\nof the standard “dictated by the U. S. Supreme Court\nunder the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.” App. 1229a.\n   Whereas the focus of §§205(a) and 206(a) is on the rea-\nsonableness of the rates charged, not the conduct of the\ncontracting parties, FERC restricted its review to the\ncontracting parties’ behavior around the time of formation.\nSee id., at 1280a–1284a. FERC seems to have thought it\nwas powerless to conduct just-and-reasonable review\nunless the contract was already subject to abrogation\n\n——————\n  3 The Court contends that FERC’s application of the Mobile-Sierra\n\ndoctrine “should be honored” because it represents the “settled under-\nstanding of the FPA.” Ante, at 23, n. 6. As explained above, however,\nFERC’s interpretation of the FPA (and of our cases construing the FPA)\nis “ ‘obviously indefensible,’ ” supra, at 3 (quoting ante, at 6), and is\ntherefore not entitled to any deference.\n                      Cite as: 554 U.

By\nincluding contracts within the scope of §206(a), however,\nCongress must have concluded that contract defenses are\ninsufficient to protect the public interest. But see ante, at\n19 (holding that the “Mobile-Sierra presumption” applies\nin all circumstances absent “traditional grounds for . . .\nabrogation” or “illegal action” by a contracting party).4\nIndeed, nothing in the FPA or this Court’s cases precludes\nFERC from considering circumstances exogenous to con-\ntract negotiations, including natural disasters and market\nmanipulation by entities not parties to the challenged\ncontract.5 FERC’s error is obvious from the face of the\norders, which repeatedly state the Commission’s belief\nthat it could not consider evidence relevant to the reason-\nableness of the contract rates.6\n——————\n  4 The   Court quite sensibly instructs FERC that “if it is clear that one\nparty to a contract engaged in such extensive unlawful market manipu-\nlation as to alter the playing field for contract negotiations, the Com-\nmission should not presume that the contract is just and reasonable”;\nand that the “mere fact that the unlawful activity occurred in a differ-\nent (but related) market does not automatically establish that it had no\neffect upon the contract—especially given the Staff Report’s (unsurpris-\ning) finding that high prices in the one market produced high prices in\nthe other.” Ante, at 25. I disagree, however, with the Court’s sugges-\ntion that the FPA restricts FERC’s review of contract rates to these\nlimited criteria.\n   5 The FPA does not specify how market deficiencies should weigh in\n\nFERC’s review of contract rates. Depending on the circumstances and\nhow one balances the short-term and long-term interests of consumers,\nevidence of “market turmoil” may, as the Court argues, support rather\ndetract from a finding that contract rates are just and reasonable. See\nante, at 18. Whether any given contract rate “ultimately benefits\nconsumers,” ante, at 22, however, is a determination that Congress has\nvested in FERC, not this Court.\n   6 See, e.g., App. 1275a (“[A] finding that the unjust and unreasonable\n\nspot market prices caused forward bilateral prices to be unjust and\nunreasonable would be relevant to contract modification only where\nthere is a ‘just and reasonable’ standard of review.

S.\n80 (1943), “we cannot accept appellate counsel’s post hoc\nrationalizations for agency action; for an agency’s order\nmust be upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated in\nthe order by the agency itself,” Texaco, 417 U. S., at 397\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, even\nassuming FERC subjectively believed that it was applying\nthe just-and-reasonable standard despite its repeated\ndeclarations to the contrary, each order must be deemed\n“so ambiguous that it falls short of that standard of clarity\nthat administrative orders must exhibit.” Id., at 395–396.\n   In order to get around the Chenery doctrine, the Court\nnot only mischaracterizes FERC’s orders, but also takes a\nmore radical tack: It concludes that whatever the rationale\nset forth in FERC’s orders, Chenery does not apply be-\ncause “the Commission was required, under our decision\nin Sierra, to apply the Mobile-Sierra presumption in its\nevaluation of the contracts here.” Ante, at 16.

Argued February 19, 2008—Decided June 26, 2008*\nUnder the Mobile-Sierra doctrine, the Federal Energy Regulatory\n Commission (FERC) must presume that the electricity rate set in a\n freely negotiated wholesale-energy contract meets the “just and rea-\n sonable” requirement of the Federal Power Act (FPA), see 16 U. S. C.\n §824d(a), and the presumption may be overcome only if FERC con-\n cludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest. See\n United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332;\n FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348. Under FERC’s cur-\n rent regulatory regime, a wholesale electricity seller may file a “mar-\n ket-based” tariff, which simply states that the utility will enter into\n freely negotiated contracts with purchasers. Those contracts are not\n filed with FERC before they go into effect. In 2000 and 2001, there\n was a dramatic increase in the price of electricity in the western\n United States. As a result, respondents entered into long-term con-\n tracts with petitioners that locked in rates that were very high by\n historical standards. Respondents subsequently asked FERC to mod-\n ify the contracts, contending that the rates should not be presumed\n just and reasonable under Mobile-Sierra. The Administrative Law\n Judge concluded that the presumption applied and that the contracts\n did not seriously harm the public interest. FERC affirmed, but the\n Ninth Circuit remanded.

The court alter-\n    natively held that there is a different standard for overcoming the\n    Mobile-Sierra presumption when a purchaser challenges a contract:\n    whether the contract exceeds a “zone of reasonableness.”\nHeld:\n    1. The Commission was required to apply the Mobile-Sierra pre-\n sumption in evaluating the contracts here. Sierra held that a rate set\n out in a contract must be presumed to be just and reasonable absent\n serious harm to the public interest, regardless of when the contract is\n challenged. FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. 380, distinguished. Also,\n the Ninth Circuit’s rule requiring FERC to ask whether a contract\n was formed in an environment of market “dysfunction” is not sup-\n ported by this Court’s cases and plainly undermines the role of con-\n tracts in the FPA’s statutory scheme. Pp. 15–19.\n    2. The Ninth Circuit’s “zone of reasonableness” test fails to accord\n an adequate level of protection to contracts. The standard for a\n buyer’s rate-increase challenge must be the same, generally, as the\n standard for a seller’s challenge: The contract rate must seriously\n harm the public interest. The Ninth Circuit misread Sierra in hold-\n ing that the standard for evaluating a high-rate challenge and setting\n aside a contract rate is whether consumers’ electricity bills were\n higher than they would have been had the contract rates equaled\n “marginal cost.” Under the Mobile-Sierra presumption, setting aside\n a contract rate requires a finding of “unequivocal public necessity,”\n Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 822, or “extraordinary\n circumstances,” Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, 453 U. S. 571,\n 582. Pp. 19–23.\n    3. The judgment below is nonetheless affirmed on alternative\n grounds, based on two defects in FERC’s analysis. First, the analysis\n was flawed or incomplete to the extent FERC looked simply to\n whether consumers’ rates increased immediately upon conclusion of\n the relevant contracts, rather than determining whether the con-\n tracts imposed an excessive burden “down the line,” relative to the\n rates consumers could have obtained (but for the contracts) after\n elimination of the dysfunctional market. Sierra’s “excessive burden”\n on customers was the current burden, not just the burden imposed at\n the contract’s outset. See 350 U. S., at 355. Second, it is unclear\n from FERC’s orders whether it found respondents’ evidence inade-\n quate to support their claim that petitioners engaged in unlawful\n market manipulation that altered the playing field for contract nego-\n tiations.

The presumption may be\novercome only if FERC concludes that the contract seri­\nously harms the public interest.

See 16 U. S. C.\n§824 et seq. Modeled on the Interstate Commerce Act, the\nFPA requires regulated utilities to file compilations of\ntheir rate schedules, or “tariffs,” with the Commission,\nand to provide service to electricity purchasers on the\nterms and prices there set forth. §824d(c). Utilities wish­\ning to change their tariffs must notify the Commission 60\ndays before the change is to go into effect. §824d(d).\nUnlike the Interstate Commerce Act, however, the FPA\nalso permits utilities to set rates with individual electric­\nity purchasers through bilateral contracts. §824d(c), (d).\nAs we have explained elsewhere, the FPA “departed from\nthe scheme of purely tariff-based regulation and acknowl­\nedged that contracts between commercial buyers and\nsellers could be used in ratesetting.” Verizon Communica­\ntions Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 479 (2002). Like tariffs,\ncontracts must be filed with the Commission before they\ngo into effect. 16 U. S. C. §824d(c), (d).\n   The FPA requires all wholesale-electricity rates to be\n“just and reasonable.” §824d(a). When a utility files a\nnew rate with the Commission, through a change to its\ntariff or a new contract, the Commission may suspend the\nrate for up to five months while it investigates whether\n\n——————\n  1 We also use “Commission” to refer to the Federal Power Commis­\n\nsion, FERC’s predecessor.\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

The Commis­\nsion may, however, decline to investigate and permit the\nrate to go into effect—which does not amount to a deter­\nmination that the rate is “just and reasonable.” See 18\nCFR §35.4 (2007). After a rate goes into effect, whether or\nnot the Commission deemed it just and reasonable when\nfiled, the Commission may conclude, in response to a\ncomplaint or on its own motion, that the rate is not just\nand reasonable and replace it with a lawful rate. 16\nU. S. C. §824e(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V).\n   The statutory requirement that rates be “just and rea­\nsonable” is obviously incapable of precise judicial defini­\ntion, and we afford great deference to the Commission in\nits rate decisions. See FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. 380,\n389 (1974); Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747,\n767 (1968). We have repeatedly emphasized that the\nCommission is not bound to any one ratemaking formula.\nSee Mobil Oil Exploration & Producing Southeast, Inc. v.\nUnited Distribution Cos., 498 U. S. 211, 224 (1991); Per­\nmian Basin, supra, at 776–777. But FERC must choose a\nmethod that entails an appropriate “balancing of the\ninvestor and the consumer interests.” FPC v. Hope Natu­\nral Gas Co., 320 U. S. 591, 603 (1944). In exercising its\nbroad discretion, the Commission traditionally reviewed\nand set tariff rates under the “cost-of-service” method,\nwhich ensures that a seller of electricity recovers its costs\nplus a rate of return sufficient to attract necessary capital.\nSee J. McGrew, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n152, 160–161 (2003) (hereinafter McGrew).\n   In two cases decided on the same day in 1956, we ad­\ndressed the authority of the Commission to modify rates\nset bilaterally by contract rather than unilaterally by\ntariff. In United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service\nCorp., 350 U. S. 332, we rejected a natural-gas utility’s\nargument that the Natural Gas Act’s requirement that it\nfile all new rates with the Commission authorized it to\n4     MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC \n\n          UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nabrogate a lawful contract with a purchaser simply by\nfiling a new tariff, see id., at 336–337. The filing require­\nment, we explained, is merely a precondition to changing a\nrate, not an authorization to change rates in violation of a\nlawful contract (i.e., a contract that sets a just and reason­\nable rate). See id., at 339–344.\n   In FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348, 352–\n353 (1956), we applied the holding of Mobile to the analo­\ngous provisions of the FPA, concluding that the complain­\ning utility could not supersede a contract rate simply by\nfiling a new tariff. In Sierra, however, the Commission\nhad concluded not only (contrary to our holding) that the\nnewly filed tariff superseded the contract, but also that\nthe contract rate itself was not just and reasonable, “solely\nbecause it yield[ed] less than a fair return on the net\ninvested capital” of the utility. Id., at 355. Thus, we were\nconfronted with the question of how the Commission may\nevaluate whether a contract rate is just and reasonable.\n   We answered that question in the following way:\n    “[T]he Commission’s conclusion appears on its face to\n    be based on an erroneous standard. . . . [W]hile it may\n    be that the Commission may not normally impose\n    upon a public utility a rate which would produce less\n    than a fair return, it does not follow that the public\n    utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate af­\n    fording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it\n    is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bar­\n    gain. . . . In such circumstances the sole concern of the\n    Commission would seem to be whether the rate is so\n    low as to adversely affect the public interest—as\n    where it might impair the financial ability of the pub­\n    lic utility to continue its service, cast upon other con­\n    sumers an excessive burden, or be unduly discrimina­\n    tory.” Id., at 354–355 (emphasis deleted).\nAs we said in a later case, “[t]he regulatory system created\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nby the [FPA] is premised on contractual agreements vol­\nuntarily devised by the regulated companies; it contem­\nplates abrogation of these agreements only in circum­\nstances of unequivocal public necessity.” Permian Basin,\nsupra, at 822.\n   Over the past 50 years, decisions of this Court and the\nCourts of Appeals have refined the Mobile-Sierra pre­\nsumption to allow greater freedom of contract. In United\nGas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas and Water Div.,\n358 U. S. 103, 110–113 (1958), we held that parties could\ncontract out of the Mobile-Sierra presumption by specify­\ning in their contracts that a new rate filed with the Com­\nmission would supersede the contract rate. Courts of\nAppeals have held that contracting parties may also agree\nto a middle option between Mobile-Sierra and Memphis\nLight: A contract that does not allow the seller to super­\nsede the contract rate by filing a new rate may nonethe­\nless permit the Commission to set aside the contract rate\nif it results in an unfair rate of return, not just if it vio­\nlates the public interest. See, e.g., Papago Tribal Util.\nAuth. v. FERC, 723 F. 2d 950, 953 (CADC 1983); Louisi­\nana Power & Light Co. v. FERC, 587 F. 2d 671, 675–676\n(CA5 1979). Thus, as the Mobile-Sierra doctrine has\ndeveloped, regulated parties have retained broad author­\nity to specify whether FERC can review a contract rate\nsolely for whether it violates the public interest or also for\nwhether it results in an unfair rate of return. But the\nMobile-Sierra presumption remains the default rule.\n   Moreover, even though the challenges in Mobile and\nSierra were brought by sellers, lower courts have con­\ncluded that the Mobile-Sierra presumption also applies\nwhere a purchaser, rather than a seller, asks FERC to\nmodify a contract. See Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. FERC,\n210 F. 3d 403, 404–405, 409–410 (CADC 2000); Boston\nEdison Co. v. FERC, 856 F. 2d 361, 372 (CA1 1988). This\nCourt has seemingly blessed that conclusion, explaining\n6     MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC \n\n          UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthat under the FPA, “[w]hen commercial parties . . . avail\nthemselves of rate agreements, the principal regulatory\nresponsibility [is] not to relieve a contracting party of an\nunreasonable rate.” Verizon, 535 U. S., at 479 (citing\nSierra, supra, at 355).\n   Over the years, the Commission began to refer to the two\nmodes of review—one with the Mobile-Sierra presumption\nand the other without—as the “public interest standard”\nand the “just and reasonable standard.” See, e.g., Southern\nCo. Servs., Inc. Gulf States Utils. Co. v. Southern Co.\nServs., Inc., 39 FERC ¶63,026, pp. 65,134, 65,141 (1987).\nDecisions from the Courts of Appeals did likewise. See,\ne.g., Kansas Cities v. FERC, 723 F. 2d 82, 87–88 (CADC\n1983); Northeast Utils. Serv. Co. v. FERC, 993 F. 2d 937,\n961 (CA1 1993). We do not take this nomenclature to\nstand for the obviously indefensible proposition that a\nstandard different from the statutory just-and-reasonable\nstandard applies to contract rates. Rather, the term “pub­\nlic interest standard” refers to the differing application of\nthat just-and-reasonable standard to contract rates. See\nPhiladelphia Elec. Co., 58 F. P. C. 88, 90 (1977). (It would\nbe less confusing to adopt the Solicitor General’s terminol­\nogy, referring to the two differing applications of the just­\nand-reasonable standard as the “ordinary” “just and rea­\nsonable standard” and the “public interest standard.” See\nReply Brief for Respondent FERC 6.)\n                              B\n\n     Recent FERC Innovations; Market-Based Tariffs \n\n  In recent decades, the Commission has undertaken an\nambitious program of market-based reforms. Part of the\nimpetus for those changes was technological evolution.\nHistorically, electric utilities had been vertically inte­\ngrated monopolies. For a particular geographic area, a\nsingle utility would control the generation of electricity, its\ntransmission, and its distribution to consumers. See\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMidwest ISO Transmission Owners v. FERC, 373 F. 3d\n1361, 1363 (CADC 2004). Since the 1970’s, however,\nengineering innovations have lowered the cost of generat­\ning electricity and transmitting it over long distances,\nenabling new entrants to challenge the regional generat­\ning monopolies of traditional utilities. See generally New\nYork v. FERC, 535 U. S. 1, 7–8 (2002); Public Util. Dist.\nNo. 1 of Snohomish Cty. v. FERC, 272 F. 3d 607, 610\n(CADC 2001).\n   To take advantage of these changes, the Commission\nhas attempted to break down regulatory and economic\nbarriers that hinder a free market in wholesale electricity.\nIt has sought to promote competition in those areas of the\nindustry amenable to competition, such as the segment\nthat generates electric power, while ensuring that the\nsegment of the industry characterized by natural monop­\noly—namely, the transmission grid that conveys the gen­\nerated electricity—cannot exert monopolistic influence\nover other areas. See New York, supra, at 9–10; Snoho­\nmish, supra. To that end, FERC required in Order No.\n888 that each transmission provider offer transmission\nservice to all customers on an equal basis by filing an\n“open access transmission tariff.” Promoting Wholesale\nCompetition Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory\nTransmission Services by Public Utilities, 61 Fed. Reg.\n21540 (1996); see New York, supra, at 10–12. That re­\nquirement prevents the utilities that own the grid from\noffering more favorable transmission terms to their own\naffiliates and thereby extending their monopoly power to\nother areas of the industry.\n   To further pry open the wholesale-electricity market\nand to reduce technical inefficiencies caused when differ­\nent utilities operate different portions of the grid inde­\npendently, the Commission has encouraged transmission\nproviders to establish “Regional Transmission Organiza­\ntions”—entities to which transmission providers would\n8     MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n          UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntransfer operational control of their facilities for the pur­\npose of efficient coordination. Order No. 2000, 65 Fed.\nReg. 810, 811–812 (2000); see Midwest ISO, supra, at\n1364. It has encouraged the management of those entities\nby “Independent System Operators,” not-for-profit entities\nthat operate transmission facilities in a nondiscriminatory\nmanner. See Midwest ISO, supra. In addition to coordi­\nnating transmission service, Regional Transmission Or­\nganizations perform other functions, such as running\nauction markets for electricity sales and offering contracts\nfor hedging against potential grid congestion. See Blum­\nsack, Measuring the Benefits and Costs of Regional Elec­\ntric Grid Integration, 28 Energy L. J. 147, 147 (2007).\n   Against this backdrop of technological change and mar-\nket-based reforms, the Commission over the past two\ndecades has begun to permit sellers of wholesale electric­\nity to file “market-based” tariffs. These tariffs, instead of\nsetting forth rate schedules or rate-fixing contracts, simply\nstate that the seller will enter into freely negotiated con­\ntracts with purchasers.      See generally Market-Based\nRates For Wholesale Sales Of Electric Energy, Capacity\nAnd Ancillary Services By Public Utilities, Order No. 697,\n72 Fed. Reg. 39904 (2007) (hereinafter Market-Based\nRates); McGrew 160–167. FERC does not subject the\ncontracts entered into under these tariffs (as it subjected\ntraditional wholesale-power contracts) to §824d’s require­\nment of immediate filing, apparently on the theory that\nthe requirement has been satisfied by the initial filing of\nthe market-based tariffs themselves. See Brief for Re­\nspondent FERC 28–29 (hereinafter Brief for FERC).\n   FERC will grant approval of a market-based tariff only\nif a utility demonstrates that it lacks or has adequately\nmitigated market power, lacks the capacity to erect other\nbarriers to entry, and has avoided giving preferences to its\naffiliates. See Market-Based Rates, ¶7, 72 Fed. Reg. 39907.\nIn addition to the initial authorization of a market-based\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntariff, FERC imposes ongoing reporting requirements. A\nseller must file quarterly reports summarizing the con­\ntracts that it has entered into, even extremely short-term\ncontracts. See California ex rel. Lockyer v. FERC, 383\nF. 3d 1006, 1013 (CA9 2004). It must also demonstrate\nevery four months that it still lacks or has adequately\nmitigated market power. See ibid. If FERC determines\nfrom these filings that a seller has reattained market\npower, it may revoke the authority prospectively. See\nMarket-Based Rates, ¶5, 72 Fed. Reg. 39906. And if the\nCommission finds that a seller has violated its Regional\nTransmission Organization’s market rules, its tariff, or\nCommission orders, the Commission may take appropriate\nremedial action, such as ordering refunds, requiring dis­\ngorgement of profits, and imposing civil penalties. See\nibid.\n   Both the Ninth Circuit and the D. C. Circuit have gen­\nerally approved FERC’s scheme of market-based tariffs.\nSee Lockyer, supra, at 1011–1013; Louisiana Energy &\nPower Auth. v. FERC, 141 F. 3d 364, 365 (CADC 1998).\nWe have not hitherto approved, and express no opinion\ntoday, on the lawfulness of the market-based-tariff sys­\ntem, which is not one of the issues before us. It suffices for\nthe present cases to recognize that when a seller files a\nmarket-based tariff, purchasers no longer have the option\nof buying electricity at a rate set by tariff and contracts no\nlonger need to be filed with FERC (and subjected to its\ninvestigatory power) before going into effect.\n                             C\n\n          California’s Electricity Regulation and \n\n                     Its Consequences \n\n   In 1996, California enacted Assembly Bill 1890 (AB\n1890), which massively restructured the California elec­\ntricity market. See 1996 Cal. Stat. ch. 854 (codified at Cal.\nPub. Util. Code Ann. §§330–398.5 (West 2004 and Supp.\n10    MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n          UTIL. DIST.

Annual Survey of Am.\nLaw 155, 172–185 (2001) (hereinafter Cudahy). The bill\ntransferred operational control of the transmission facili­\nties of California’s three largest investor-owned utilities to\nan Independent Service Operator (Cal-ISO). See Pacific\nGas & Elec. Co. v. FERC, 464 F. 3d 861, 864 (CA9 2006).\nIt also established the California Power Exchange\n(CalPX), a nonprofit entity that operated a short-term\nmarket—or “spot market”—for electricity. The bill re­\nquired California’s three largest investor-owned utilities to\ndivest most of their electricity-generation facilities. It\nthen required those utilities to purchase and sell the bulk\nof their electricity from and to the CalPX’s spot market,\npermitting only limited leeway for them to enter into long-\nterm contracts. See Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish\nCty. v. FERC, 471 F. 3d 1053, 1068 (CA9 2006) (case\nbelow).\n   In 1997, FERC approved the Cal-ISO as consistent with\nthe requirements for an Independent Service Operator\nestablished in Order No. 888. FERC also approved the\nCalPX and the investor-owned utilities’ authority to make\nsales at market-based rates in the CalPX, finding that, in\nlight of the divesture of their generation units and other\nconditions imposed under the restructuring plan, those\nutilities had adequately mitigated their market power.\nSee Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 81 FERC ¶61,122, pp. 61,435,\n61,435–61,436, 61,537–61,548 (1997).\n   The CalPX opened for business in March 1998. In the\nsummer of 1999, it expanded to include an auction for\nsales of electricity under “forward contracts”—contracts in\nwhich sellers promise to deliver electricity more than one\nday in the future (sometimes many years). But the par­\nticipation of California’s large investor-owned utilities in\nthat forward market was limited because, as we have said,\nAB 1890 strictly capped the amount of power that they\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

See 471 F. 3d,\nat 1068.\n  That diminishment of the role of long-term contracts in\nthe California electricity market turned out to be one of\nthe seeds of an energy crisis. In the summer of 2000, the\nprice of electricity in the CalPX’s spot market jumped\ndramatically—more than fifteenfold. See ibid. The in­\ncrease was the result of a combination of natural, eco­\nnomic, and regulatory factors: “flawed market rules; in­\nadequate addition of generating facilities in the preceding\nyears; a drop in available hydropower due to drought\nconditions; a rupture of a major pipeline supplying natural\ngas into California; strong growth in the economy and in\nelectricity demand; unusually high temperatures; an\nincrease in unplanned outages of extremely old generating\nfacilities; and market manipulation.” CAlifornians for\nRenewable Energy, Inc. v. Sellers of Energy and Ancillary\nServs., 119 FERC ¶61,058, pp. 61,243, 61,246 (2007).\nBecause California’s investor-owned utilities had for the\nmost part been forbidden to obtain their power through\nlong-term contracts, the turmoil in the spot market hit\nthem hard. See Cudahy 174. The high prices led to roll­\ning blackouts and saddled utilities with mounting debt.\n  In late 2000, the Commission took action. A central\nplank of its emergency effort was to eliminate the utilities’\nreliance on the CalPX’s spot market and to shift their\npurchases to the forward market. To that end, FERC\nabolished the requirement that investor-owned utilities\npurchase and sell all power through the CalPX and en­\ncouraged them to enter into long-term contracts.

Al­\nthough they are not located in California, the high prices\nin California spilled over into other Western States. See\n471 F. 3d, at 1069. Petitioners are the sellers that entered\ninto the contracts with respondents.\n  The contracts between the parties included rates that\nwere very high by historical standards. For example,\nrespondent Snohomish signed a 9-year contract to pur­\nchase electricity from petitioner Morgan Stanley at a rate\nof $105/megawatt hour (MWh), whereas prices in the\nPacific Northwest have historically averaged $24/MWh.\nThe contract prices were substantially lower, however,\nthan the prices that Snohomish would have paid in the\nspot market during the energy crisis, when prices peaked\nat $3,300/MWh. See id., at 1069–1070.\n  After the crisis had passed, buyer’s remorse set in and\nrespondents asked FERC to modify the contracts. They\ncontended that the rates in the contracts should not be\npresumed to be just and reasonable under Mobile-Sierra\nbecause, given the sellers’ market-based tariffs, the\ncontracts had never been initially approved by the Com­\nmission without the presumption. See Nevada Power Co.\nv. Enron Power Marketing, Inc., 103 FERC ¶61,353,\npp. 62,382, 62,387 (2003). Respondents also argued that\ncontract modification was warranted even under the Mo­\nbile-Sierra presumption because the contract rates were so\nhigh that they violated the public interest. See 103 FERC,\nat 62,383, 62,387–62,395.\n  In a preliminary order, the Commission instructed the\nAdministrative Law Judge (ALJ) to consider 12 different\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfactors in deciding whether the presumption could be\novercome for the contracts, such as the terms of the con­\ntracts, the available alternatives at the time of sale, the\nrelationship of the rates to Commission benchmarks, the\neffect of the contracts on the financial health of the pur­\nchasers, and the impact of contract modification on na­\ntional energy markets. After a hearing, the ALJ con­\ncluded that the Mobile-Sierra presumption should apply to\nthe contracts and that the contracts did not seriously\nharm the public interest. In fact, according to the ALJ,\neven if the Mobile-Sierra presumption did not apply,\nrespondents would not be entitled to have the contracts\nmodified. 103 FERC, at 62,390–62,394.\n   Between the ALJ’s decision and the Commission’s rul­\ning, the Commission’s staff issued a report (Staff Report)\nconcluding that unlawful activities of various sellers in the\nspot market had affected prices in the forward market.\nSee id., at 62,396. Respondents raised the report at oral\nargument before the Commission, and some of them ar­\ngued that petitioners “were unlawfully manipulating\nmarket prices, thereby engaging in fraud and deception in\nviolation of their market-based rate tariffs.” Ibid. Peti­\ntioners contended, however, that the Staff Report demon­\nstrated only a correlation between rates in the spot and\nforward markets, not a causal connection. See ibid.\n   FERC affirmed the ALJ. The Commission first held\nthat the Mobile-Sierra presumption did apply to the con­\ntracts at issue. Although agreeing with respondents that\nthe presumption applies only where FERC has had an\ninitial opportunity to review a contract rate, the Commis­\nsion relied on the somewhat metaphysical ground that the\ngrant of market-based authority to petitioners qualified as\nthat initial opportunity. See 103 FERC, at 62,388–62,389.\nThe Commission then held that respondents could not\novercome the Mobile-Sierra presumption. It recognized\nthat the Staff Report had “found that spot market distor­\n14     MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n           UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY.\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions flowed through to forward power prices,” 103 FERC,\nat 62,396–62,397, but concluded that this finding, even if\ntrue, was not “determinative” because:\n     “a finding that the unjust and unreasonable spot mar­\n     ket caused forward bilateral prices to be unjust and\n     unreasonable would be relevant to contract modifica­\n     tion only where there is a ‘just and reasonable’ stan­\n     dard of review. . . . Under the ‘public interest’ stan­\n     dard, to justify contract modification it is not enough\n     to show that forward prices became unjust and unrea­\n     sonable due to the impact of spot market dysfunctions;\n     it must be shown that the rates, terms and conditions\n     are contrary to the public interest.” Id., at 62,397.\n   The Commission determined that under the factors\nidentified in Sierra, as well as under a totality-of-the­\ncircumstances test, respondents had not demonstrated\nthat the contracts threatened the public interest. See 103\nFERC, at 62,397–62,399. On rehearing, respondents\nreiterated their complaints, including their charge that\n“their contracts were the product of market manipulation\nby Enron, Morgan Stanley and other [sellers].” 105 FERC\n¶61,185, pp. 61,979, 61,989 (2003). The Commission an­\nswered that there was “no evidence to support a finding of\nmarket manipulation that specifically affected the con­\ntracts at issue.” Ibid.\n   Respondents filed petitions for review in the Ninth\nCircuit, which granted the petitions and remanded to the\nCommission, finding two flaws in the Commission’s analy­\nsis.2 First, the court agreed with respondents that rates\nset by contract (whether pursuant to a market-based tariff\n——————\n  2 In a holding not challenged before this Court, the Ninth Circuit con­\n\ncluded that the contracts at issue did not contain “Memphis clause[s],”\n471 F. 3d 1053, 1079 (2006) (citing United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis\nLight, Gas and Water Div., 358 U. S. 103 (1958)), see supra, at 5, that\nwould have precluded application of the Mobile-Sierra presumption.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)         15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor not) are presumptively reasonable only where FERC\nhas had an initial opportunity to review the contracts\nwithout applying the Mobile-Sierra presumption. To\nsatisfy that prerequisite under the market-based tariff\nregime, the court said, the Commission must promptly\nreview the terms of contracts after their formation and\nmust modify those that do not appear to be just and rea­\nsonable when evaluated without the Mobile-Sierra pre­\nsumption (rather than merely revoking market-based\nauthority prospectively but leaving pre-existing contracts\nintact). See 471 F. 3d, at 1075–1077, 1079–1085. This\ninitial review must include an inquiry into “the market\nconditions in which the contracts at issue were formed,”\nand market “dysfunction” is a ground for finding a con­\ntract not to be just and reasonable. Id., at 1085–1087.\nSecond, the Ninth Circuit held that even assuming that\nthe Mobile-Sierra presumption applied, the standard for\novercoming that presumption is different for a purchaser’s\nchallenge to a contract, namely, whether the contract rate\nexceeds a “zone of reasonableness.” 471 F. 3d, at 1088–\n1090.\n  We granted certiorari. See 551 U. S. ___ (2007).\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n        Application of Mobile-Sierra Presumption to \n\n         Contracts Concluded under Market-Based \n\n                       Rate Authority \n\n  As noted earlier, the FERC order under review here\nagreed with the Ninth Circuit’s premise that the Commis­\nsion must have an initial opportunity to review a contract\nwithout the Mobile-Sierra presumption, but maintained\nthat the authorization for market-based rate authority\nqualified as that initial review. Before this Court, how­\never, FERC changes its tune, arguing that there is no such\nprerequisite—or at least that FERC could reasonably\n16    MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n          UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nconclude so and therefore that Chevron deference is in\norder. See Brief for FERC 20–21, 33–34; Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837 (1984). We will not uphold a discretionary agency\ndecision where the agency has offered a justification in\ncourt different from what it provided in its opinion. See\nSEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. 80, 94–95 (1943). But\nFERC has lucked out: The Chenery doctrine has no appli­\ncation to these cases, because we conclude that the Com­\nmission was required, under our decision in Sierra, to\napply the Mobile-Sierra presumption in its evaluation of\nthe contracts here. That it provided a different rationale\nfor the necessary result is no cause for upsetting its ruling.\n“To remand would be an idle and useless formality. Chen­\nery does not require that we convert judicial review of\nagency action into a ping-pong game.” NLRB v. Wyman-\nGordon Co., 394 U. S. 759, 766–767, n. 6 (1969) (plurality\nopinion).\n   We are in broad agreement with the Ninth Circuit on a\ncentral premise: There is only one statutory standard for\nassessing wholesale electricity rates, whether set by con­\ntract or tariff—the just-and-reasonable standard. The\nplain text of the FPA states that “[a]ll rates . . . shall be\njust and reasonable.” 16 U. S. C. §824d(a); see also\n§824e(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V). But we disagree with the\nNinth Circuit’s interpretation of Sierra as requiring (con­\ntrary to the statute) that the Commission apply the stan­\ndard differently, depending on when a contract rate is\nchallenged. In the Ninth Circuit’s view, Sierra was prem­\nised on the idea that “as long as the rate was just and\nreasonable when the contract was formed, there would be\na presumption. . .that the reasonableness continued\nthroughout the term of the contract.” 471 F. 3d, at 1077.\nIn other words, so long as the Commission concludes\n(either after a hearing or by allowing a rate to go into\neffect) that a contract rate is just and reasonable when\n                       Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                       17\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\ninitially filed, the rate will be presumed just and reason­\nable in future proceedings.\n   That is a misreading of Sierra. Sierra was grounded in\nthe commonsense notion that “[i]n wholesale markets, the\nparty charging the rate and the party charged [are] often\nsophisticated businesses enjoying presumptively equal\nbargaining power, who could be expected to negotiate a\n‘just and reasonable’ rate as between the two of them.”\nVerizon, 535 U. S., at 479. Therefore, only when the mu­\ntually agreed-upon contract rate seriously harms the\nconsuming public may the Commission declare it not to be\njust and reasonable.3 Sierra thus provided a definition of\nwhat it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and-reasonable\nstandard in the contract context—a definition that applies\nregardless of when the contract is reviewed. The Ninth\nCircuit, by contrast, essentially read Sierra “as the equiva­\nlent of an estoppel doctrine,” whereby an initial Commis­\nsion opportunity for review prevents the Commission from\nmodifying the rates absent serious future harm to the\npublic interest. Tewksbury & Lim, Applying the Mobile-\nSierra Doctrine to Market-Based Rate Contracts, 26 En­\nergy L. J. 437, 457–458 (2005). But Sierra said nothing of\nthe sort. And given that the Commission’s passive per­\nmission for a rate to go into effect does not constitute a\nfinding that the rate is just and reasonable, it would be\nodd to treat that initial “opportunity for review” as curtail­\ning later challenges.\n   The Ninth Circuit found support for its prerequisite in\nour decision in FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. 380 (1974).\nIn that case, we warned that the Commission’s attempt to\nrely solely on market forces to evaluate rates charged by\n\n——————\n  3 We  do not say, as the dissent alleges, post, at 7 (opinion of\nSTEVENS, J.), that the public interest is not also relevant in a challenge\nto unilaterally set rates. But it is the “ ‘sole concern’ ” in a contract case.\nSee FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348, 355 (1956).\n18   MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n         UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsmall natural-gas producers was inconsistent with the\nNatural Gas Act’s insistence that rates be just and rea­\nsonable. See id., at 397. The Ninth Circuit apparently\ntook this to mean that all initially filed contracts must be\nsubject to review without the Mobile-Sierra presumption.\nBut Texaco had nothing to do with that doctrine. It held\nthat the Commission had improperly implemented a\nscheme of total deregulation by applying no standard of\nreview at all to small-producer rates. See 417 U. S., at\n395–397. It did not cast doubt on the proposition that in a\nproper regulatory scheme, the ordinary mode for evaluat­\ning contractually set rates is to look to whether the rates\nseriously harm the public interest, not to whether they are\nunfair to one of the parties that voluntarily assented to\nthe contract. Cf. id., at 391, n. 4.\n   Nor do we agree with the Ninth Circuit that FERC must\ninquire into whether a contract was formed in an envi­\nronment of market “dysfunction” before applying the\nMobile-Sierra presumption. Markets are not perfect, and\none of the reasons that parties enter into wholesale-power\ncontracts is precisely to hedge against the volatility that\nmarket imperfections produce. That is why one of the\nCommission’s responses to the energy crisis was to remove\nregulatory barriers to long-term contracts. It would be a\nperverse rule that rendered contracts less likely to be\nenforced when there is volatility in the market. (Such a\nrule would come into play, after all, only when a contract\nformed in a period of “dysfunction” did not significantly\nharm the consuming public, since contracts that seriously\nharm the public should be set aside even under the Mo­\nbile-Sierra presumption.) By enabling sophisticated par­\nties who weathered market turmoil by entering long-term\ncontracts to renounce those contracts once the storm has\npassed, the Ninth Circuit’s holding would reduce the\nincentive to conclude such contracts in the future. Such a\nrule has no support in our case law and plainly under­\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmines the role of contracts in the FPA’s statutory scheme.\n   To be sure, FERC has ample authority to set aside a\ncontract where there is unfair dealing at the contract\nformation stage—for instance, if it finds traditional\ngrounds for the abrogation of the contract such as fraud or\nduress. See 103 FERC, at 62,399–62,400 (“[T]here is no\nevidence of unfairness, bad faith, or duress in the original\nnegotiations”). In addition, if the “dysfunctional” market\nconditions under which the contract was formed were\ncaused by illegal action of one of the parties, FERC should\nnot apply the Mobile-Sierra presumption. See Part III,\ninfra. But the mere fact that the market is imperfect, or\neven chaotic, is no reason to undermine the stabilizing\nforce of contracts that the FPA embraced as an alternative\nto “purely tariff-based regulation.” Verizon, 535 U. S., at\n479. We may add that evaluating market “dysfunction” is\na very difficult and highly speculative task—not one that\nthe FPA would likely require the agency to engage in\nbefore holding sophisticated parties to their bargains.\n   We reiterate that we do not address the lawfulness of\nFERC’s market-based-rates scheme, which assuredly has\nits critics. But any needed revision in that scheme is\nproperly addressed in a challenge to the scheme itself, not\nthrough a disfigurement of the venerable Mobile-Sierra\ndoctrine. We hold only that FERC may abrogate a valid\ncontract only if it harms the public interest.\n                              B\n\n             Application of “Excessive Burden”\n\n            Exception to High-Rate Challenges\n\n  We turn now to the Ninth Circuit’s second holding: that\na “zone of reasonableness” test should be used to evaluate\na buyer’s challenge that a rate is too high. In our view\nthat fails to accord an adequate level of protection to\ncontracts. The standard for a buyer’s challenge must be\nthe same, generally speaking, as the standard for a seller’s\n20        MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n              UTIL. DIST.

That is the standard that the Commission\napplied in the proceedings below.\n   We are again in agreement with the Ninth Circuit on a\nstarting premise: It is clear that the three factors we\nidentified in Sierra—“where [a rate] might impair the\nfinancial ability of the public utility to continue its service,\ncast upon other consumers an excessive burden, or be\nunduly discriminatory,” 350 U. S., at 355—are not all\nprecisely applicable to the high-rate challenge of a pur­\nchaser (where, for example, the relevant question is not\nwhether “other customers” [of the utility] would be exces­\nsively burdened, but whether any customers of the pur­\nchaser would be); and that those three factors are in any\nevent not the exclusive components of the public interest.\nIn its decision below, the Commission recognized both\nthese realities. See 103 FERC, at 62,397 (“Nevada Com­\npanies failed to show that the contract terms at issue\nimpose an excessive burden on their customers” (emphasis\nadded)); id., at 62,398 (“The record also demonstrates that\nSnohomish presented no evidence that its contract with\nMorgan Stanley adversely affected Snohomish or its rate­\npayers” (emphasis added)); id., at 62,398–62,399 (evaluat­\ning the “totality of circumstances”); see also Brief for\nFERC 41–42.4\n   Where we disagree with the Ninth Circuit is on the\n——————\n  4 Thedissent criticizes the Commission’s decision because it took into\naccount under the heading “totality of the circumstances” only the\ncircumstances of the contract formation, not “circumstances exogenous\nto contract negotiations, including natural disasters and market\nmanipulation by entities not parties to the challenged contract.” Post,\nat 13. Those considerations are relevant to whether the contracts\nimpose an “excessive burden” on consumers relative to what they would\nhave paid absent the contracts. It is precisely our uncertainty whether\nthe Commission considered those “circumstances exogenous to contract\nnegotiations,” discussed in Part III of our opinion, that causes us to\napprove the remand to FERC.\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

The Ninth Circuit derived this test\nfrom our statement in Sierra that a contract rate would\nhave to be modified if it were so low that it imposed an\n“excessive burden” on other wholesale purchasers. The\nNinth Circuit took “excessive burden” to mean merely the\nburden caused when one set of consumers is forced to pay\nabove marginal cost to compensate for below-marginal­\n\n——————\n   5 Elsewhere the Ninth Circuit softened this standard somewhat, say­\n\ning that “[e]ven if a particular rate exceeds marginal cost . . . it may\nstill be within this reasonable range—or ‘zone of reasonableness’—if\nthat higher-than-cost-based price results from normal market forces\nand is part of a general trend toward rates that do reflect cost.” 471\nF. 3d, at 1089. We are not sure (and we think no one can be sure)\nprecisely what this means. It has no basis in our opinions, and is in\nany event wrong because its point of departure (the general principle\nthat rates cannot exceed marginal cost) contradicts Mobile-Sierra.\n   The Ninth Circuit purported to find support for its “zone of reason­\nableness” test in the case law of the District of Columbia Circuit. But\nthe cited case stands only for the proposition that a market-based\nscheme must assure that market forces will, “over the long pull,” cause\nrates to approximate marginal cost. Interstate Natural Gas Assn. of\nAm. v. FERC, 285 F. 3d 18, 31 (2002). Nowhere does the opinion\nsuggest that the standard for reforming a particular contract validly\nentered into under a market-based scheme is whether the rates ap­\nproximate marginal cost.\n   By the same token, our approval of FERC’s decision not to set pro­\nspective area rates solely with reference to pre-existing contract prices,\nPermian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 792–793 (1968), does\nnot support, as the dissent thinks, post, at 8, n. 2, the view that the\nstandard for abrogating an existing, valid contract is anything less than\nthe Mobile-Sierra standard. That is the standard Permian Basin\napplied when actually confronted with the issue of contract modifica­\ntion. See 390 U. S., at 781–784, 821–822.\n22    MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n          UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\ncost rates charged other consumers. See 471 F. 3d, at\n1088. And it proceeded to apply a similar notion of “exces­\nsive burden” to high-rate challenges (where all the burden\nof the above-marginal-cost contract rate falls on the pur­\nchaser’s own customers, and does not affect the customers\nof third parties). Id., at 1089. That is a misreading of\nSierra and our later cases. A presumption of validity that\ndisappears when the rate is above marginal cost is no\npresumption of validity at all, but a reinstitution of cost-\nbased rather than contract-based regulation. We have\nsaid that, under the Mobile-Sierra presumption, setting\naside a contract rate requires a finding of “unequivocal\npublic necessity,” Permian Basin, 390 U. S., at 822, or\n“extraordinary circumstances,” Arkansas Louisiana Gas\nCo. v. Hall, 453 U. S. 571, 582 (1981). In no way can these\ndescriptions be thought to refer to the mere exceeding of\nmarginal cost.\n    The Ninth Circuit’s standard would give short shrift to\nthe important role of contracts in the FPA, as reflected in\nour decision in Sierra, and would threaten to inject more\nvolatility into the electricity market by undermining a key\nsource of stability. The FPA recognizes that contract\nstability ultimately benefits consumers, even if short-term\nrates for a subset of the public might be high by historical\nstandards—which is why it permits rates to be set by\ncontract and not just by tariff. As the Commission has\nrecently put it, its “first and foremost duty is to protect\nconsumers from unjust and unreasonable rates; however,\n. . . uncertainties regarding rate stability and contract\nsanctity can have a chilling effect on investments and a\nseller’s willingness to enter into long-term contracts and\nthis, in turn, can harm customers in the long run.” Mar-\nket-Based Rates, ¶6, 72 Fed.

Assuming that FERC even ventured to under­\ntake such an analysis, rather than reverting to the ancien\nrégime of cost-of-service ratesetting, the regulatory costs\nwould be enormous. We think that the FPA intended to\nreserve the Commission’s contract-abrogation power for\nthose extraordinary circumstances where the public will\nbe severely harmed.6\n                          III\n    Defects in FERC’s Analysis Supporting Remand\n  Despite our significant disagreement with the Ninth\n——————\n  6 The dissent claims that we have misread the FPA because its provi­\nsions “do not distinguish between rates set unilaterally by tariff and\nrates set bilaterally by contract.” Post, at 2. But the dissent’s interpre­\ntation, whatever plausibility it has as an original matter, cannot be\nsquared with Sierra, which plainly distinguished between unilaterally\nand bilaterally set rates, and said that the only relevant consideration\nfor the Commission in the latter case is whether the public interest is\nharmed. And the circumstances identified in Sierra as implicating the\npublic interest refer to something more than a small dent in the con­\nsumer’s pocket, which is why our subsequent cases have described the\nstandard as a high one.\n  At the end of the day, the dissent simply argues against the settled\nunderstanding of the FPA that has prevailed in this Court, lower\ncourts, and the Commission for half a century. Although the dissent is\ncorrect that we have never used the phrase “Mobile-Sierra doctrine” in\nour cases, that is probably because the understanding of it was so\nuniform that no circuit split concerning its meaning arose until the\nNinth Circuit’s erroneous decision in these cases. If one searches the\nCommission’s reports, over 600 decisions since 2000 alone have cited\nthe doctrine, see Brief for Electric Power Supply Association et al. as\nAmici Curiae 15, and the Courts of Appeals have used the term “Mo­\nbile-Sierra doctrine” (or “Sierra-Mobile” doctrine) over 75 times since\n1974. If there were ever a context where long-settled understanding\nshould be honored it is here, where a statutory decision (subject to\nrevision by Congress) has been understood the same way for many\nyears by lower courts, by this Court, by the federal agency the statute\ngoverns, and hence surely by the private actors trying to observe the\nlaw.\n24    MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n          UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit, we find two errors in the Commission’s analysis,\nand we therefore affirm the judgment below on alternative\ngrounds.\n   First, it appears, as the Ninth Circuit concluded, see 471\nF. 3d, at 1090, that the Commission may have looked\nsimply to whether consumers’ rates increased immediately\nupon the relevant contracts’ going into effect, rather than\ndetermining whether the contracts imposed an excessive\nburden on consumers “down the line,” relative to the rates\nthey could have obtained (but for the contracts) after\nelimination of the dysfunctional market. For example, the\nCommission concluded that two of the respondents would\nexperience “rate decreases of approximately 20 percent for\nretail service” during the period covered by the contracts.\n103 FERC, at 62,397. But the baseline for that computa­\ntion was the rate they were paying before the contracts\nwent into effect. That disparity is certainly a relevant\nconsideration; but so is the disparity between the contract\nrate and the rates consumers would have paid (but for the\ncontracts) further down the line, when the open market\nwas no longer dysfunctional. That disparity, past a cer­\ntain point, could amount to an “excessive burden.” That is\nwhat was contemplated by Sierra, which involved a chal­\nlenge 5 years into a 15-year contract. The “excessive\nburden” on other customers to which the opinion referred\nwas assuredly the current burden, and not only the bur­\nden imposed at the very outset of the contract. See 350\nU. S., at 355. The “unequivocal public necessity” that\njustifies overriding the Mobile-Sierra presumption does\nnot disappear as a factor once the contract enters into\nforce. Thus, FERC’s analysis on this point was flawed—or\nat least incomplete. As the Ninth Circuit put it, “[i]t is\nentirely possible that rates had increased so high during\nthe energy crises because of dysfunction in the spot mar­\nket that, even with the acknowledged decrease in rates,\nconsumers still paid more under the forward contracts\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthan they otherwise would have.” 471 F. 3d, at 1090. If\nthat is so, and if that increase is so great that, even taking\ninto account the desirability of fostering market-\nstabilizing long-term contracts, the rates impose an exces­\nsive burden on consumers or otherwise seriously harm the\npublic interest, the rates must be disallowed.\n   Second, respondents alleged before FERC that some of\nthe petitioners in these cases had engaged in market\nmanipulation in the spot market. See, e.g., 105 FERC, at\n61,989 (“Snohomish and Nevada Companies argue that\ntheir contracts were the product of market manipulation\nby Enron, Morgan Stanley and other Respondents, which,\nas established by the Commission Staff, engaged in mar­\nket manipulation”). The Staff Report concluded, as we\nhave said, that the abnormally high prices in the spot\nmarket during the energy crisis influenced the terms of\ncontracts in the forward market. But the Commission\ndismissed the relevance of the Staff Report on the ground\nthat it had not demonstrated that forward market prices\nwere so high as to overcome the Mobile-Sierra presump­\ntion. We conclude, however, that if it is clear that one\nparty to a contract engaged in such extensive unlawful\nmarket manipulation as to alter the playing field for con­\ntract negotiations, the Commission should not presume\nthat the contract is just and reasonable. Like fraud and\nduress, unlawful market activity that directly affects\ncontract negotiations eliminates the premise on which the\nMobile-Sierra presumption rests: that the contract rates\nare the product of fair, arms-length negotiations. The\nmere fact that the unlawful activity occurred in a different\n(but related) market does not automatically establish that\nit had no effect upon the contract—especially given the\nStaff Report’s (unsurprising) finding that high prices in\nthe one market produced high prices in the other. We are\nunable to determine from the Commission’s orders\nwhether it found the evidence inadequate to support the\nclaim that respondents’ alleged unlawful activities af­\n26   MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n         UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY.\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nfected the contracts at issue here. It said in its order on\nrehearing, 105 FERC, at 61,989, that “[w]e . . . found no\nevidence to support a finding of market manipulation [by\nrespondents] that specifically affected the contracts at\nissue.” But perhaps that must be read in light of the\nCommission’s above described rejection of the Staff Report\non the ground that high spot market prices caused by\nmanipulation are irrelevant unless the forward market\nprices fail the Mobile-Sierra standard; and in light of the\nstatement in its initial order, in apparent response to the\nclaim of spot-market manipulation by respondents, 103\nFERC, at 62,397, that “a finding that the unjust and\nunreasonable spot market prices caused forward bilateral\nprices to be unjust and unreasonable would be relevant to\ncontract modification only where there is a ‘just and rea­\nsonable’ standard of review.”\n   We emphasize that the mere fact of a party’s engaging\nin unlawful activity in the spot market does not deprive its\nforward contracts of the benefit of the Mobile-Sierra pre­\nsumption. There is no reason why FERC should be able to\nabrogate a contract on these grounds without finding a\ncausal connection between unlawful activity and the\ncontract rate. Where, however, causality has been estab­\nlished, the Mobile-Sierra presumption should not apply.\n   On remand, the Commission should amplify or clarify\nits findings on these two points. The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals is affirmed, and the cases are remanded\nfor proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE BREYER took no part in\nthe consideration or decision of these cases.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

The opening sentence of the Court’s opinion tells us\nthat the “Mobile-Sierra doctrine”—a term that makes its\nfirst appearance in the United States Reports today—\nmandates an affirmative answer. This holding finds no\nsupport in either case that lends its name to the doctrine.\nNevertheless, in the interest of guarding against “disfig-\nurement of the venerable Mobile-Sierra doctrine,” ante, at\n19, the Court mangles both the governing statute and\n2     MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v.

C. §791a et seq., wholesale electricity prices are\nestablished in the first instance by public utilities, either\nvia tariffs or in contracts with purchasers. §824d(c).\nWhether set by tariff or contract, all rates must be filed\nwith the Commission. See ibid. Section 205(a) of the FPA\nprovides, “All rates and charges . . . shall be just and\nreasonable, and any such rate or charge that is not just\nand reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.” 16\nU. S. C. §824d(a). Pursuant to §206(a), if FERC deter-\nmines “that any rate . . . or that any rule, regulation,\npractice, or contract affect[ing] such rate . . . is unjust [or]\nunreasonable . . . , the Commission shall determine the\njust and reasonable rate, . . . rule, regulation, practice, or\ncontract to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall\nfix the same by order.” 16 U. S. C. §824e(a). These provi-\nsions distinguish between the rate-setting roles of utilities\n(which initially set rates) and the Commission (which may\noverride utility-set rates that are not just and reasonable),\nbut they do not distinguish between rates set unilaterally\nby tariff and rates set bilaterally by contract. However the\nutility sets its prices, the standard of review is the same—\nrates must be just and reasonable.\n   The Court purports to acknowledge that “[t]here is only\none statutory standard for assessing wholesale electricity\nrates, whether set by contract or tariff—the just-and-\nreasonable standard.” Ante, at 16. Unlike rates set by\ntariff, however, the Court holds that any “freely negoti-\nated” contract rate is presumptively just and reasonable\nunless it “seriously harms” the public interest. Ante, at 1.\nAccording to the Court, this presumption represents a\n“differing application of [the] just-and-reasonable stan-\ndard,” but not a different standard altogether. Ante, at 6.\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)             3\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nI disagree. There is no significant difference between\nrequiring a heightened showing to overcome an otherwise\nconclusive presumption and imposing a heightened stan-\ndard of review. I agree that applying a separate standard\nof review to contract rates is “obviously indefensible,”\nibid., but that is also true with respect to the Court’s\npresumption.\n  Even if the “Mobile-Sierra presumption” were not tan-\ntamount to a separate standard, nothing in the statute\nmandates “differing application” of the statutory standard\nto rates set by contract. Ibid. Section 206(a) of the FPA\nprovides, “without qualification or exception,” that FERC\nmay replace any unjust or unreasonable contract with a\nlawful contract. Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390\nU. S. 747, 783–784 (1968) (construing identical language\nin the Natural Gas Act, 15 U. S. C. §717d(a)). The statute\ndoes not say anything about a mandatory presumption for\ncontracts, much less define the burden of proof for over-\ncoming it or delineate the circumstances for its nonappli-\ncation. Cf. ante, at 1, 19. Nor does the statute prohibit\nFERC from considering marginal cost when reviewing\nrates set by contract. Cf. ante, at 20–22, and n. 5.\n  If Congress had intended to impose such detailed con-\nstraints on the Commission’s authority to review contract\nrates, it would have done so itself in the FPA. Congress\ninstead used the general words “just and reasonable”\nbecause it wanted to give FERC, not the courts, wide\nlatitude in setting policy. As we explained in Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 843–844 (1984):\n       “ ‘The power of an administrative agency to admin-\n    ister a congressionally created . . . program necessar-\n    ily requires the formulation of policy and the making\n    of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by\n    Congress.’ Morton v.

NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY. \n\n                   STEVENS, J., dissenting \n\n\n    If Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to\n    fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the\n    agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute\n    by regulation. Such legislative regulations are given\n    controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capri-\n    cious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. Some-\n    times the legislative delegation to an agency on a par-\n    ticular question is implicit rather than explicit. In\n    such a case, a court may not substitute its own con-\n    struction of a statutory provision for a reasonable in-\n    terpretation made by the administrator of an agency.”\n    (Footnote omitted.)\n  Consistent with this understanding of administrative\nlaw, our cases interpreting the FPA have invariably “em-\nphasized that courts are without authority to set aside any\nrate adopted by the Commission which is within a ‘zone of\nreasonableness.’ ” Permian Basin, 390 U. S., at 797. But\nsee ante, at 19 (asserting that “a ‘zone of reasonableness’\ntest . . . fails to accord an adequate level of protection to\ncontracts”). This deference makes eminent sense because\n“rate-making agencies are not bound to the service of any\nsingle regulatory formula; they are permitted, unless their\nstatutory authority otherwise plainly indicates, ‘to make\nthe pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by\nparticular circumstances.’ ” Permian Basin, 390 U. S., at\n776–777. Despite paying lipservice to this principle, see\nante, at 3, the Court binds the Commission to a rigid\nformula of the Court’s own making.\n  Having found no statutory text that supports its vision\nof the Mobile-Sierra doctrine, the Court invokes the “im-\nportant role of contracts in the FPA.” Ante, at 22. But\ncontracts play an “important role” in the FPA only insofar\nas the statute “departed from the scheme of purely tariff-\nbased regulation.” Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC,\n535 U.

Both United\nGas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S.\n332 (1956), and FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.

See ante, at 3–4. Rather, Mobile merely held\nthat utilities cannot unilaterally abrogate contracts with\npurchasers by filing new rate schedules with the Commis-\nsion. See 350 U. S., at 339–341. The Court neglects to\nmention, however, that although Mobile had no occasion to\ncomment on the standard of review, it did imply that\nCongress would not have permitted parties to establish\nrates by contract but for “the protection of the public\n\n——————\n  1 See also, e.g., Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v.

See 350 U. S., at 351–352.\nSeveral years later the utility complained that the rate\nprovided too little profit and was therefore not “just and\nreasonable.” The Commission agreed and set aside the\nrate “solely because it yield[ed] less than a fair return on\nthe net invested capital.” See id., at 354–355. The Court\nvacated and remanded on the ground that the Commission\nhad applied an erroneous standard. “[W]hile it may be\nthat the Commission may not normally impose upon a\npublic utility a rate which would produce less than a fair\nreturn,” the Court reasoned, “it does not follow that the\npublic utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate\naffording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it is\nentitled to be relieved of its improvident bargain.” Id., at\n355. When the seller has agreed to a rate that it later\nchallenges as too low, “the sole concern of the Commission\nwould seem to be whether the rate is so low as to ad-\nversely affect the public interest—as where it might im-\npair the financial ability of the public utility to continue\nits service, cast upon other consumers an excessive bur-\nden, or be unduly discriminatory.” Ibid. The Court fur-\nther elaborated on what it meant by the “public interest”:\n    “That the purpose of the power given the Commission\n    by §206(a) is the protection of the public interest, as\n    distinguished from the private interests of the utili-\n    ties, is evidenced by the recital in §201 of the Act that\n    the scheme of regulation imposed ‘is necessary in the\n    public interest.’ When §206(a) is read in the light of\n    this purpose, it is clear that a contract may not be\n    said to be either ‘unjust’ or ‘unreasonable’ simply be-\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

S. C. §824(a),\nwhether a rate is “just and reasonable” is measured\nagainst the public interest, not the private interests of\nregulated sellers. Contrary to the opinion of the Court,\nsee ante, at 23, n. 6, Sierra instructs that the public inter-\nest is the touchstone for just-and-reasonable review of all\nrates, not just contract rates. Sierra drew a distinction\nbetween the Commission’s authority to impose low rates\non utilities and its authority to abrogate low rates agreed\nto by utilities because these actions impact the public\ninterest differently, not because the public interest gov-\nerns rates set bilaterally but not rates set unilaterally.\nWhen the Commission imposes rates that afford less than\na fair return, it compromises the public’s interest in at-\ntracting necessary capital. The impact is different, how-\never, if a utility has agreed to a low rate because investors\nrecognize that the utility, not the regulator, is responsible\nfor the unattractive rate of return.\n  Sierra used “public interest” as shorthand for the inter-\nest of consumers in paying “ ‘the lowest possible reason-\nable rate consistent with the maintenance of adequate\nservice in the public interest.’ ” Permian Basin, 390 U. S.,\nat 793 (quoting Atlantic Refining Co. v. Public Serv.\nComm’n of N. Y., 360 U. S. 378, 388 (1959)). Whereas\nhigh rates directly implicate this interest, low rates do so\nonly indirectly, such as when the rate is so low that it\n“might impair the financial ability of the public utility to\ncontinue its service, cast upon other consumers an exces-\nsive burden, or be unduly discriminatory.” Sierra, 350\nU. S., at 355. Nothing in Sierra purports to mandate a\n“serious harm” standard of review, or to require any as-\nsumption that high rates and low rates impose symmetric\nburdens on the public interest. Cf. ante, at 19–20. As we\n8      MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC \n\n           UTIL. DIST.

S. 380, 399\n(1974), the Commission cannot ignore even “a small dent\nin the consumer’s pocket” because “the Act makes unlaw-\nful all rates which are not just and reasonable, and does\nnot say a little unlawfulness is permitted.”\n  Brushing aside the text of the FPA, as well as the hold-\nings in Mobile and Sierra themselves, the Court cherry\npicks language from Verizon, Arkla, and Permian Basin.\nBoth Verizon and Arkla mentioned the Mobile-Sierra line\nof cases only in passing, and neither case had anything to\ndo with just-and-reasonable review of rates. See Verizon,\n535 U. S., at 479; Arkla, 453 U. S. 571, 582 (1981). Fur-\nthermore, the statement in Permian Basin about “un-\nequivocal public necessity,” 390 U. S., at 822, speaks to the\ndifficulty of establishing injury to the public interest in the\ncontext of a low-rate challenge, not a high-rate challenge.2\n——————\n   2 The Court repeatedly quotes the following snippet from the 75-page\n\nopinion in Permian Basin: “The regulatory system created by the Act is\npremised on contractual agreements voluntarily devised by the regu-\nlated companies; it contemplates abrogation of these agreements only\nin circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.” 390 U. S., at 822\n(cited ante, at 5, 22, 24). Like FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350\nU. S. 348 (1956), however, Permian Basin made this statement in the\ncourse of rejecting a low-rate challenge. Read in context, the Court’s\nreference to “unequivocal public necessity” is a loose restatement of\nSierra, which required “evidence of injury to the public interest,” and\nwhich underscored how rarely a utility will be able to demonstrate that\na “contract price is so ‘low as to adversely affect the public interest.’ ”\n390 U. S., at 820–821 (quoting Sierra, 350 U. S., at 355). The Court’s\nexpansive reading of the “unequivocal public necessity” statement\ncannot be squared with Permian Basin’s discussion of the Commission’s\nauthority to review rates set by contract: “Although the Natural Gas\nAct is premised upon a continuing system of private contracting, the\nCommission has plenary authority to limit or to proscribe contractual\narrangements that contravene the relevant public interests.” 390 U. S.,\nat 784 (citation omitted). Nor can it be reconciled with Permian Basin’s\nrejection of the producers’ arguments (1) that the Commission “wrongly\ninvalidated existing contracts” by imposing a ceiling on rates, see id., at\n781–784, and (2) that the Commission was compelled to adopt contract\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

Of course, “the desirability of fostering\nmarket-stabilizing long-term contracts,” ante, at 25, plays\ninto the public interest insofar as the “Commission’s re-\nsponsibilities include the protection of future, as well as\npresent, consumer interests,” Permian Basin, 390 U. S., at\n798; see also United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light,\nGas and Water Div., 358 U. S. 103, 113 (1958) (“It seems\nplain that Congress . . . was not only expressing its convic-\ntion that the public interest requires the protection of\nconsumers from excessive prices for natural gas, but was\nalso manifesting its concern for the legitimate interests of\nnatural gas companies in whose financial stability the gas-\nconsuming public has a vital stake”). But under the FPA,\nCongress has charged FERC, not the courts, with balanc-\ning the short-term and long-term interests of consumers.\nSee Permian Basin, 390 U.

It follows, then, that “the Commission\nlacks the authority to place exclusive reliance on market\nprices.” Texaco, 417 U. S., at 400; see also id., at 399 (“In\nsubjecting producers to regulation because of anticompeti-\ntive conditions in the industry, Congress could not have\nassumed that ‘just and reasonable’ rates could conclu-\nsively be determined by reference to market price”). For\nthis reason, we have already rejected the policy rationale\nproffered by the Court today:\n     “It may be, as some economists have persuasively ar-\n     gued, that the assumptions of the 1930’s about the\n     competitive structure of the natural gas industry, if\n     true then, are no longer true today.

This is not to say that the Commis-\nsion should abrogate any contract that increases rates, but\nto underscore that the agency is “obliged at each step of its\nregulatory process to assess the requirements of the broad\npublic interests entrusted to its protection by Congress.”\nPermian Basin, 390 U. S., at 791.\n                              IV\n   Even if, as the Court holds today, the “Mobile-Sierra\npresumption” is merely a “differing application” of the\nstatutory just-and-reasonable standard, FERC’s orders\nmust be set aside because they were not decided on this\nbasis.\n   The FERC orders repeatedly aver that the agency is\napplying a “public interest” standard different from and\ndistinctly more demanding than the statutory standard.\nSee, e.g., App. 1198a (“[T]he burden of showing that a\ncontract is contrary to the public interest is a higher bur-\nden than showing that a contract is not just and reason-\nable. . . . The fact that a contract may be found to be un-\njust and unreasonable under [§§205 and 206] does not in\nand of itself demonstrate that the contract is contrary to\nthe public interest under the Supreme Court cases”).\nIndeed, the Commission’s misunderstanding of our cases\nis so egregious that the sellers, concerned that the orders\nwould be overturned, asked the Commission for “clarifica-\ntion that the public interest standard of review does not\nauthorize unjust and unreasonable rates.” Id., at 1506a,\n1567a. FERC clarified as follows:\n    “[I]f rates . . . become unjust and unreasonable and\n    the contract at issue is subject to the Mobile-Sierra\n    standard of review, the Commission under court\n    precedent may not change the contract simply because\n    it is no longer just and reasonable.

S., at 396, in these cases FERC refused outright to\napply that standard.3\n   In addition to misrepresenting FERC’s understanding of\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine as a presumption rather than a\nseparate standard, the Court overstates the extent to\nwhich FERC considered the lawfulness of the rates. The\nCourt recognizes, as it must, that the three factors identi-\nfied in Sierra are neither exclusive nor “precisely applica-\nble to the high-rate challenge of a purchaser.” See ante, at\n20; Brief for Respondent FERC 41–42. Although FERC\napplied what it termed the “Sierra Three-Prong Test,”\nApp. 1276a, the Court contends the agency did not err\nbecause it also evaluated the “ ‘totality of the circum-\nstances,’ ” see ante, at 20. But FERC’s totality-of-the-\ncircumstances review was infected by its misapprehension\nof the standard “dictated by the U. S. Supreme Court\nunder the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.” App. 1229a.\n   Whereas the focus of §§205(a) and 206(a) is on the rea-\nsonableness of the rates charged, not the conduct of the\ncontracting parties, FERC restricted its review to the\ncontracting parties’ behavior around the time of formation.\nSee id., at 1280a–1284a. FERC seems to have thought it\nwas powerless to conduct just-and-reasonable review\nunless the contract was already subject to abrogation\n\n——————\n  3 The Court contends that FERC’s application of the Mobile-Sierra\n\ndoctrine “should be honored” because it represents the “settled under-\nstanding of the FPA.” Ante, at 23, n. 6. As explained above, however,\nFERC’s interpretation of the FPA (and of our cases construing the FPA)\nis “ ‘obviously indefensible,’ ” supra, at 3 (quoting ante, at 6), and is\ntherefore not entitled to any deference.\n                      Cite as: 554 U.

By\nincluding contracts within the scope of §206(a), however,\nCongress must have concluded that contract defenses are\ninsufficient to protect the public interest. But see ante, at\n19 (holding that the “Mobile-Sierra presumption” applies\nin all circumstances absent “traditional grounds for . . .\nabrogation” or “illegal action” by a contracting party).4\nIndeed, nothing in the FPA or this Court’s cases precludes\nFERC from considering circumstances exogenous to con-\ntract negotiations, including natural disasters and market\nmanipulation by entities not parties to the challenged\ncontract.5 FERC’s error is obvious from the face of the\norders, which repeatedly state the Commission’s belief\nthat it could not consider evidence relevant to the reason-\nableness of the contract rates.6\n——————\n  4 The   Court quite sensibly instructs FERC that “if it is clear that one\nparty to a contract engaged in such extensive unlawful market manipu-\nlation as to alter the playing field for contract negotiations, the Com-\nmission should not presume that the contract is just and reasonable”;\nand that the “mere fact that the unlawful activity occurred in a differ-\nent (but related) market does not automatically establish that it had no\neffect upon the contract—especially given the Staff Report’s (unsurpris-\ning) finding that high prices in the one market produced high prices in\nthe other.” Ante, at 25. I disagree, however, with the Court’s sugges-\ntion that the FPA restricts FERC’s review of contract rates to these\nlimited criteria.\n   5 The FPA does not specify how market deficiencies should weigh in\n\nFERC’s review of contract rates. Depending on the circumstances and\nhow one balances the short-term and long-term interests of consumers,\nevidence of “market turmoil” may, as the Court argues, support rather\ndetract from a finding that contract rates are just and reasonable. See\nante, at 18. Whether any given contract rate “ultimately benefits\nconsumers,” ante, at 22, however, is a determination that Congress has\nvested in FERC, not this Court.\n   6 See, e.g., App. 1275a (“[A] finding that the unjust and unreasonable\n\nspot market prices caused forward bilateral prices to be unjust and\nunreasonable would be relevant to contract modification only where\nthere is a ‘just and reasonable’ standard of review. As we have previ-\nously concluded, the contracts at issue in this proceeding do not provide\n14     MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC\n           UTIL. DIST. NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH CTY.\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   Although the Court and the Commission attempt to\nrecast FERC’s orders as applying the statutory standard,\nsee ante, at 13–14; Brief for Respondent FERC 21, under\nthe doctrine set forth in SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S.\n80 (1943), “we cannot accept appellate counsel’s post hoc\nrationalizations for agency action; for an agency’s order\nmust be upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated in\nthe order by the agency itself,” Texaco, 417 U. S., at 397\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, even\nassuming FERC subjectively believed that it was applying\nthe just-and-reasonable standard despite its repeated\ndeclarations to the contrary, each order must be deemed\n“so ambiguous that it falls short of that standard of clarity\nthat administrative orders must exhibit.” Id., at 395–396.\n   In order to get around the Chenery doctrine, the Court\nnot only mischaracterizes FERC’s orders, but also takes a\nmore radical tack: It concludes that whatever the rationale\nset forth in FERC’s orders, Chenery does not apply be-\ncause “the Commission was required, under our decision\nin Sierra, to apply the Mobile-Sierra presumption in its\nevaluation of the contracts here.” Ante, at 16. This point\nprompts the Court to comment that “FERC has lucked\nout.” Ibid. If the Commission has “lucked out,” it is not\nonly a purely fortuitous victory, but also a Pyrrhic one.\n——————\nfor such a standard but rather evidence an intent that the contracts\nmay be changed only pursuant to the ‘public interest’ standard of\nreview. Under the ‘public interest’ standard, to justify contract modifi-\ncation it is not enough to show that forward prices became unjust and\nunreasonable due to the impact of spot market dysfunctions” (footnote\nomitted)); id., at 1527a (“Complainants were required to meet the\npublic interest standard of review, not the just and reasonable standard\nof review which could have taken into account the causal connection\nbetween the spot market prices and forward bilateral market prices”);\nid., at 1534a (“The Staff Report did not make any findings regarding\nthe justness and reasonableness of any contract rates and any such\nfindings would not be relevant here because the just and reasonable\nstandard is not applicable”).\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)          15\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nAlthough FERC prevails in these cases despite having\n“offered a justification in court different from what it\nprovided in its opinion,” ibid., it has paid a tremendous\nprice. The Court has curtailed the agency’s authority to\ninterpret the terms “just and reasonable” and thereby\nsubstantially narrowed FERC’s discretion to protect the\npublic interest by the means it thinks best. Contrary to\ncongressional intent, FERC no longer has the flexibility to\nadjust its review of contractual rates to account for chang-\ning conditions in the energy markets or among consumers.\nCf. Permian Basin, 390 U. S., at 784 (“[A]dministrative\nauthorities must be permitted, consistently with the obli-\ngations of due process, to adapt their rules and policies to\nthe demands of changing circumstances”).\n                              V\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit deserves praise for its efforts to bring the freewheel-\ning Mobile-Sierra doctrine back in line with the FPA and\nthis Court’s cases. I cannot endorse the opinion in its\nentirety, however, because it verges into the same sort of\nimproper policymaking that I have criticized in the Court’s\nopinion. Both decisions would hobble the Commission,\nalbeit from different sides. Congress has not authorized\ncourts to prescribe energy policy by imposing presump-\ntions or prerequisites, or by making marginal cost the sole\nconcern or no concern at all. I would therefore vacate and\nremand the cases in order to give the Commission an\nopportunity to evaluate the contract rates in light of a\nproper understanding of its discretion.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145778/", "sha1": "b34b2128ad97a32a1a30b6871a863856f8cb3259", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2007-070", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:07:41"}
