Argued April 14, 2008\u2014Decided June 25, 2008\nPetitioner Plains Commerce Bank (Bank), a non-Indian bank, sold land\n  it owned in fee simple on a tribal reservation to non-Indians. Re-\n  spondents the Longs, an Indian couple who had been leasing the land\n  with an option to purchase, claim the Bank discriminated against\n  them by selling the parcel to nonmembers of the Tribe on terms more\n  favorable than the Bank offered to sell it to them. The couple sued in\n  Tribal Court, asserting, inter alia, discrimination, breach-of-contract,\n  and bad-faith claims. Over the Bank\u2019s objection, the Tribal Court\n  concluded that it had jurisdiction and proceeded to trial, where a jury\n  ruled against the Bank on three claims, including the discrimination\n  claim. The court awarded the Longs damages plus interest. In a\n  supplemental judgment, the court also gave the Longs an option to\n  purchase that portion of the fee land they still occupied, nullifying\n  the Bank\u2019s sale of the land to non-Indians. After the Tribal Court of\n  Appeals affirmed, the Bank filed suit in Federal District Court, con-\n  tending that the tribal judgment was null and void because, as rele-\n  vant here, the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction over the Longs\u2019 dis-\n  crimination claim. The District Court granted the Longs summary\n  judgment, finding tribal court jurisdiction proper because the Bank\u2019s\n  consensual relationship with the Longs and their company (also a re-\n  spondent here) brought the Bank within the first category of tribal\n  civil jurisdiction over nonmembers outlined in Montana v. United\n  States, 450 U. S. 544. The Eighth Circuit affirmed, concluding that\n  the Tribe had authority to regulate the business conduct of persons\n  voluntarily dealing with tribal members, including a nonmember\u2019s\n  sale of fee land.\n2      PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                      CATTLE CO.                                          \n\n                        Syllabus \n\n\nHeld:\n    1. The Bank has Article III standing to pursue this challenge. Both\n with respect to damages and the option to purchase, the Bank was\n \u201cinjured in fact,\u201d see Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555,\n 560, by the Tribal Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the discrimina-\n tion claim. This Court is unpersuaded by the Longs\u2019 claim that the\n damages award was premised entirely on their breach-of-contract\n verdict, which the Bank has not challenged, rather than on their dis-\n crimination claim. Because the verdict form allowed the jury to make\n a damages award after finding liability as to any of the individual\n claims, the jury could have based its damages award, in whole or in\n part, on the discrimination finding. The Bank was also injured by\n the option to purchase. Only the Longs\u2019 discrimination claim sought\n deed to the land as relief. The fact that the remedial purchase option\n applied only to a portion of the total parcel does not eliminate the in-\n jury to the Bank, which had no obligation to sell any of the land to\n the Longs before the Tribal Court\u2019s judgment. That judgment effec-\n tively nullified a portion of the sale to a third party. These injuries\n can be remedied by a ruling that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction\n and that its judgment on the discrimination claim is null and void.\n Pp. 5\u20138.\n    2. The Tribal Court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate a dis-\n crimination claim concerning the non-Indian Bank\u2019s sale of its fee\n land. Pp. 8\u201324.\n       (a) The general rule that tribes do not possess authority over\n non-Indians who come within their borders, Montana v. United\n States, 450 U. S. 564, 565, restricts tribal authority over nonmember\n activities taking place on the reservation, and is particularly strong\n when the nonmember\u2019s activity occurs on land owned in fee simple by\n non-Indians, Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438, 446. Once\n tribal land is converted into fee simple, the tribe loses plenary juris-\n diction over it. See County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and\n Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 267\u2013268. Moreover, when\n the tribe or its members convey fee land to third parties, the tribe\n \u201closes any former right of absolute and exclusive use and occupation\n of the conveyed lands.\u201d South Dakota v. Bourland, 508 U. S. 679,\n 689. Thus, \u201cthe tribe has no authority itself . . . to regulate the use of\n fee land.\u201d Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Na-\n tion, 492 U. S. 408, 430. Montana provides two exceptions under\n which tribes may exercise \u201ccivil jurisdiction over non-Indians on their\n reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands,\u201d 450 U. S., at 565: (1) \u201cA\n tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the\n activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with\n the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts,\n                   Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nleases, or other arrangements,\u201d ibid.; and (2) a tribe may exercise\n\u201ccivil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within\nthe reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect\non the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or wel-\nfare of the tribe,\u201d id., at 566. Neither exception authorizes tribal\ncourts to exercise jurisdiction over the Longs\u2019 discrimination claim.\nPp. 8\u201311.\n     (b) The Tribal Court lacks jurisdiction to hear that claim because\nthe Tribe lacks the civil authority to regulate the Bank\u2019s sale of its\nfee land, and \u201ca tribe\u2019s adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its\nlegislative jurisdiction,\u201d Strate, supra, at 453. Montana does not\npermit tribes to regulate the sale of non-Indian fee land. Rather, it\npermits tribal regulation of nonmember conduct inside the reserva-\ntion that implicates the tribe\u2019s sovereign interests. 450 U. S., at 564\u2013\n565. With only one exception, see Brendale, supra, this Court has\nnever \u201cupheld under Montana the extension of tribal civil authority\nover nonmembers on non-Indian land,\u201d Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U. S.\n353, 360. Nor has the Court found that Montana authorized a tribe\nto regulate the sale of such land. This makes good sense, given the\nlimited nature of tribal sovereignty and the liberty interests of non-\nmembers. Tribal sovereign interests are confined to managing tribal\nland, see Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561, protecting tribal self-\ngovernment, and controlling internal relations, see Montana, supra,\nat 564. Regulations approved under Montana all flow from these lim-\nited interests. See, e.g., Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676, 696. None of\nthese interests justified tribal regulation of a nonmember\u2019s sale of fee\nland. The Tribe cannot justify regulation of the sale of non-Indian fee\nland by reference to its power to superintend tribal land because non-\nIndian fee parcels have ceased to be tribal land. Nor can regulation\nof fee land sales be justified by the Tribe\u2019s interest in protecting in-\nternal relations and self-government. Any direct harm sustained be-\ncause of a fee land sale is sustained at the point the land passes from\nIndian to non-Indian hands. Resale, by itself, causes no additional\ndamage. Regulating fee land sales also runs the risk of subjecting\nnonmembers to tribal regulatory authority without their consent.\nBecause the Bill of Rights does not apply to tribes and because non-\nmembers have no say in the laws and regulations governing tribal\nterritory, tribal laws and regulations may be applied only to non-\nmembers who have consented to tribal authority, expressly or by ac-\ntion. Even then the regulation must stem from the tribe\u2019s inherent\nsovereign authority to set conditions on entry, preserve self-\ngovernment, or control internal relations. There is no reason the\nBank should have anticipated that its general business dealings with\nthe Longs would permit the Tribe to regulate the Bank\u2019s sale of land\n4        PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                        CATTLE CO.                                                \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    it owned in fee simple. The Longs\u2019 attempt to salvage their position\n    by arguing that the discrimination claim should be read to challenge\n    the Bank\u2019s whole course of commercial dealings with them is unavail-\n    ing. Their breach-of-contract and bad-faith claims involve the Bank\u2019s\n    general dealings; the discrimination claim does not. The discrimina-\n    tion claim is tied specifically to the fee land sale. And only the dis-\n    crimination claim is before the Court. Pp. 11\u201322.\n         (c) Because the second Montana exception stems from the same\n    sovereign interests giving rise to the first, it is also inapplicable here.\n    The \u201cconduct\u201d covered by that exception must do more than injure a\n    tribe; it must \u201cimperil the subsistence\u201d of the tribal community.\n    Montana, 450 U. S., at 566. The land at issue has been owned by a\n    non-Indian party for at least 50 years. Its resale to another non-\n    Indian hardly \u201cimperil[s] the subsistence or welfare of the tribe.\u201d\n    Ibid. Pp. 22\u201323.\n         (d) Contrary to the Longs\u2019 argument, when the Bank sought the\n    Tribal Court\u2019s aid in serving process on the Longs for the Bank\u2019s\n    pending state-court eviction action, the Bank did not consent to tribal\n    court jurisdiction over the discrimination claim.

The couple sued on that claim in tribal\ncourt; the bank contested the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The\ntribal court concluded that it had jurisdiction and pro-\nceeded to hear the case. It ultimately ruled against the\nbank and awarded the Indian couple damages and the\nright to purchase a portion of the fee land. The question\npresented is whether the tribal court had jurisdiction to\nadjudicate a discrimination claim concerning the non-\nIndian bank\u2019s sale of fee land it owned. We hold that it\ndid not.\n                         I\n  The Long Family Land and Cattle Company, Inc. (Long\n2    PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                     CATTLE CO.                           \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nCompany or Company), is a family-run ranching and\nfarming operation incorporated under the laws of South\nDakota. Its lands are located on the Cheyenne River\nSioux Indian Reservation. Once a massive, 60-million\nacre affair, the reservation was appreciably diminished by\nCongress in the 1880s and at present consists of roughly\n11 million acres located in Dewey and Ziebach Counties in\nnorth-central South Dakota. The Long Company is a\nrespondent here, along with Ronnie and Lila Long, hus-\nband and wife, who together own at least 51 percent of the\nCompany\u2019s shares. Ronnie and Lila Long are both en-\nrolled members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian Tribe.\n   The Longs and their Company have been customers for\nmany years at Plains Commerce Bank (Bank), located\nsome 25 miles off the reservation as the crow flies in Ho-\nven, South Dakota. The Bank, like the Long Company, is\na South Dakota corporation, but has no ties to the reserva-\ntion other than its business dealings with tribal members.\nThe Bank made its first commercial loan to the Long\nCompany in 1989, and a series of agreements followed. As\npart of those agreements, Kenneth Long\u2014Ronnie Long\u2019s\nfather and a non-Indian\u2014mortgaged to the Bank 2,230\nacres of fee land he owned inside the reservation. At the\ntime of Kenneth Long\u2019s death in the summer of 1995,\nKenneth and the Long Company owed the Bank $750,000.\n   In the spring of 1996, Ronnie and Lila Long began\nnegotiating a new loan contract with the Bank in an effort\nto shore up their Company\u2019s flagging financial fortunes\nand come to terms with their outstanding debts. After\nseveral months of back-and-forth, the parties finally\nreached an agreement in December of that year\u2014two\nagreements, to be precise. The Company and the Bank\nsigned a fresh loan contract, according to which Kenneth\nLong\u2019s estate deeded over the previously mortgaged fee\nacreage to the Bank in lieu of foreclosure. App. 104. In\nreturn, the Bank agreed to cancel some of the Company\u2019s\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndebt and to make additional operating loans. The parties\nalso agreed to a lease arrangement: The Company re-\nceived a two-year lease on the 2,230 acres, deeded over to\nthe Bank, with an option to purchase the land at the end\nof the term for $468,000. Id., at 96\u2013103.\n   It is at this point, the Longs claim, that the Bank began\ntreating them badly. The Longs say the Bank initially\noffered more favorable purchase terms in the lease agree-\nment, allegedly proposing to sell the land back to the\nLongs with a 20-year contract for deed. The Bank eventu-\nally rescinded that offer, the Longs claim, citing \u201c \u2018possible\njurisdictional problems\u2019 \u201d that might have been caused by\nthe Bank financing an \u201c \u2018Indian owned entity on the reser-\nvation.\u2019 \u201d 491 F. 3d 878, 882 (CA8 2007) (case below).\n   Then came the punishing winter of 1996\u20131997. The\nLongs lost over 500 head of cattle in the blizzards that\nseason, with the result that the Long Company was un-\nable to exercise its option to purchase the leased acreage\nwhen the lease contract expired in 1998. Nevertheless,\nthe Longs refused to vacate the property, prompting the\nBank to initiate eviction proceedings in state court and to\npetition the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Court to serve\nthe Longs with a notice to quit. In the meantime, the\nBank sold 320 acres of the fee land it owned to a non-\nIndian couple. In June 1999, while the Longs continued to\noccupy a 960-acre parcel of the land, the Bank sold the\nremaining 1,910 acres to two other nonmembers.\n   In July 1999, the Longs and the Long Company filed\nsuit against the Bank in the Tribal Court, seeking an\ninjunction to prevent their eviction from the property and\nto reverse the sale of the land. They asserted a variety of\nclaims, including breach of contract, bad faith, violation of\ntribal-law self-help remedies, and discrimination. The\ndiscrimination claim alleged that the Bank sold the land\nto nonmembers on terms more favorable than those of-\nfered the Company. The Bank asserted in its answer that\n4    PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                     CATTLE CO.                                \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe court lacked jurisdiction and also stated a counter-\nclaim. The Tribal Court found that it had jurisdiction,\ndenied the Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its\ncounterclaim, and proceeded to trial. Four causes of ac-\ntion were submitted to the seven-member jury: breach of\ncontract, bad faith, violation of self-help remedies, and\ndiscrimination.\n   The jury found for the Longs on three of the four causes,\nincluding the discrimination claim, and awarded a\n$750,000 general verdict. After denying the Bank\u2019s post-\ntrial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict by\nfinding again that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the\nLongs\u2019 claims, the Tribal Court entered judgment award-\ning the Longs $750,000 plus interest. A later supplemen-\ntal judgment further awarded the Longs an option to\npurchase the 960 acres of the land they still occupied on\nthe terms offered in the original purchase option, effec-\ntively nullifying the Bank\u2019s previous sale of that land to\nnon-Indians.\n   The Bank appealed to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal\nCourt of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the trial\ncourt. The Bank then filed the instant action in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of South\nDakota, seeking a declaration that the tribal judgment\nwas null and void because, as relevant here, the Tribal\nCourt lacked jurisdiction over the Longs\u2019 discrimination\nclaim. The District Court granted summary judgment to\nthe Longs. The court found tribal court jurisdiction proper\nbecause the Bank had entered into a consensual relation-\nship with the Longs and the Long Company. 440 F. Supp.\n2d 1070, 1077\u20131078, 1080\u20131081 (SD 2006). According to\nthe District Court, this relationship brought the Bank\nwithin the first category of tribal civil jurisdiction over\nnonmembers outlined in Montana v. United States, 450\nU. S. 544 (1981). \tSee 440 F. Supp. 2d, at 1077\u20131078.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n491 F. 3d 878. The Longs\u2019 discrimination claim, the court\nheld, \u201carose directly from their preexisting commercial\nrelationship with the bank.\u201d Id., at 887. When the Bank\nchose to deal with the Longs, it effectively consented to\nsubstantive regulation by the tribe: An antidiscrimination\ntort claim was just another way of regulating the commer-\ncial transactions between the parties. See ibid. In sum,\nthe Tribe had authority to regulate the business conduct of\npersons who \u201cvoluntarily deal with tribal members,\u201d in-\ncluding, here, a nonmember\u2019s sale of fee land. Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n   Before considering the Tribal Court\u2019s authority to adju-\ndicate the discrimination claim, we must first address the\nLongs\u2019 contention that the Bank lacks standing to raise\nthis jurisdictional challenge in the first place. Though the\nLongs raised their standing argument for the first time\nbefore this Court, we bear an independent obligation to\nassure ourselves that jurisdiction is proper before proceed-\ning to the merits. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Envi-\nronment, 523 U. S. 83, 94\u201395 (1998).\n   We begin by noting that whether a tribal court has\nadjudicative authority over nonmembers is a federal ques-\ntion. See Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U. S. 9, 15\n(1987); National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe,\n471 U. S. 845, 852\u2013853 (1985). If the tribal court is found\nto lack such jurisdiction, any judgment as to the nonmem-\nber is necessarily null and void. The Longs do not contest\nthis settled principle but argue instead that the Bank has\nsuffered no \u201cinjury in fact\u201d as required by Article III\u2019s\ncase-or-controversy provision. See Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992).\n   The Longs appear to recognize their argument is some-\nwhat counterintuitive. They concede the jury found the\n6    PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                     CATTLE CO.                                \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBank guilty of discrimination and awarded them $750,000\nplus interest. But the Longs contend the jury\u2019s damages\naward was in fact premised entirely on their breach-of-\ncontract rather than on their discrimination claim. The\nBank does not presently challenge the breach-of-contract\nverdict.\n   In support of their argument, the Longs point to their\namended complaint in the Tribal Court. The complaint\ncomprised nine counts. Several of the counts sought dam-\nages; the discrimination count did not. As relief for the\ndiscrimination claim, the Longs asked to be granted \u201cpos-\nsession and title to their land.\u201d App. 173. The Longs\ncontend that the damage award therefore had nothing to\ndo with the discrimination claim. As a result, a decision\nfrom this Court finding no jurisdiction with respect to that\nclaim\u2014the only claim the Bank appeals\u2014would not\nchange anything.\n   We are not persuaded. The jury verdict form consisted\nof six special interrogatories, covering each claim asserted\nagainst the Bank, with another one covering the amount\nof damages to be awarded. Id., at 190\u2013192. The damages\ninterrogatory specifically allowed the jury to make an\naward after finding liability as to any of the individual\nclaims: \u201cIf you answered yes to Numbers 1, 3, 4, or 5 what\namount of damages should be awarded to the Plaintiffs?\u201d\nId., at 192 (emphasis added). The jury found against the\nBank on three of the special interrogatories, including\nnumber 4, the discrimination claim. The Bank, the jurors\nfound, \u201cintentionally discriminate[d] against the Plaintiffs\nRonnie and Lila Long.\u201d Id., at 191. The jury then entered\nan award of $750,000. Id., at 192. These facts establish\nthat the jury could have based its damages award, in\nwhole or in part, on the finding of discrimination.\n   There is, in addition, the option to purchase. The Longs\nargue that requiring the Bank to void the sale to non-\nmembers of a 960\u2013acre parcel and sell that parcel to them\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninstead does not constitute injury-in-fact, because the\nTribal Court actually denied the relief the Longs sought\nfor the Bank\u2019s discrimination. In its supplemental judg-\nment, the Tribal Court refused to permit the Longs (or the\nLong Company) to purchase all the land\u2014as they had\nrequested\u2014instead granting an option to purchase only\nthe 960 acres the Longs occupied at the time. See Sup-\nplemental Judgment in No. R\u2013120\u201399, Long Family Land\n& Cattle Co. v. Maciejewski, (Feb. 18, 2003), App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. A\u201369 to A\u201370. Even this partial relief, the Longs\ninsist, was crafted as an equitable remedy for their\nbreach-of-contract claim, see Brief for Respondents 32\u201334,\nand in any event the Bank really suffered no harm, be-\ncause it would gain as much income selling to the Longs as\nit did selling to the nonmembers, see id., at 34\u201335.\n   These arguments do not defeat the Bank\u2019s standing.\nThe Longs requested, as a remedy for the alleged dis-\ncrimination, \u201cpossession and title\u201d to the subject land.\nApp. 173. They received an option to acquire a portion of\nexactly that. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u201369 to A\u201370. The\nTribal Court\u2019s silence in its supplemental judgment as to\nwhich claim, exactly, the option to purchase was meant to\nremedy is immaterial. See ibid. Of the four claims pre-\nsented to the jury, only the discrimination claim sought\ndeed to the land as relief. See Amended Complaint (Jan.\n3, 2000), App. 158, 173. Nor does the fact that the reme-\ndial purchase option applied only to a portion of the total\nparcel eliminate the Bank\u2019s injury. The Bank had no\nobligation to sell the land to the Longs before the Tribal\nCourt\u2019s judgment\u2014indeed, the Bank had already sold the\nacreage to third parties. The Tribal Court judgment effec-\ntively nullified a portion of that sale. This judicially im-\nposed burden certainly qualifies as an injury for standing\npurposes. As for the Longs\u2019 speculation that the Bank\nwould make as much money selling the land to them as it\ndid selling the parcel to nonmembers, the argument is\n8    PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v.

There is more than adequate\ninjury in being compelled to undo one deed and enter into\nanother\u2014particularly with individuals who had previously\ndefaulted on loans.\n   Both with respect to damages and the option to pur-\nchase, the Bank was injured by the Tribal Court\u2019s exercise\nof jurisdiction over the discrimination claim. Those inju-\nries can be remedied by a ruling in favor of the Bank that\nthe Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction and that its judgment\non the discrimination claim is null and void. The ultimate\ncollateral consequence of such a determination, whatever\nit may be\u2014vacatur of the general damages award, vacatur\nof the option to purchase, a new trial on the other claims\u2014\ndoes not alter the fact that the Bank has shown injury\ntraceable to the challenged action and likely to be re-\ndressed by a favorable ruling.

Navajo Tribe, 471 U. S. 195, 201 (1985), to deter-\nmine tribal membership, see Santa Clara Pueblo v. Marti-\nnez, 436 U.

They may also exclude outsiders from\nentering tribal land. See Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676,\n696\u2013697 (1990). But tribes do not, as a general matter,\npossess authority over non-Indians who come within their\nborders: \u201c[T]he inherent sovereign powers of an Indian\ntribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the\ntribe.\u201d Montana, at 450 U. S., at 565. As we explained in\nOliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191 (1978), the\ntribes have, by virtue of their incorporation into the\nAmerican republic, lost \u201cthe right of governing . . . per-\nson[s] within their limits except themselves.\u201d Id., at 209\n(emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted).\n   This general rule restricts tribal authority over non-\nmember activities taking place on the reservation, and is\nparticularly strong when the nonmember\u2019s activity occurs\non land owned in fee simple by non-Indians\u2014what we\nhave called \u201cnon-Indian fee land.\u201d Strate v.

Suffice it to say\nhere that the effect of the Act was to convert millions of\nacres of formerly tribal land into fee simple parcels, \u201cfully\nalienable,\u201d id., at 264, and \u201cfree of all charge or encum-\nbrance whatsoever,\u201d 25 U.

(hereinafter Cohen).\n   Our cases have made clear that once tribal land is con-\nverted into fee simple, the tribe loses plenary jurisdiction\nover it. See County of Yakima, supra, at 267\u2013268 (General\nAllotment Act permits Yakima County to impose\nad valorem tax on fee land located within the reservation);\nGoudy v. Meath, 203 U.

Among the powers lost is the authority\nto prevent the land\u2019s sale, see County of Yakima, supra, at\n263 (General Allotment Act granted fee holders power of\nvoluntary sale)\u2014not surprisingly, as \u201cfree alienability\u201d by\nthe holder is a core attribute of the fee simple, C.

Moreover, when the tribe or tribal members convey\na parcel of fee land \u201cto non-Indians, [the tribe] loses any\nformer right of absolute and exclusive use and occupation\nof the conveyed lands.\u201d South Dakota v.

S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We have recognized two exceptions to this principle,\ncircumstances in which tribes may exercise \u201ccivil jurisdic-\ntion over non-Indians on their reservations, even on non-\nIndian fee lands.\u201d Montana, 450 U. S., at 565. First, \u201c[a]\ntribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other\nmeans, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual\nrelationships with the tribe or its members, through com-\nmercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements.\u201d\nIbid. Second, a tribe may exercise \u201ccivil authority over the\nconduct of non-Indians on fee lands within the reservation\nwhen that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on\nthe political integrity, the economic security, or the health\nor welfare of the tribe.\u201d Id., at 566. These rules have\nbecome known as the Montana exceptions, after the case\nthat elaborated them. By their terms, the exceptions\nconcern regulation of \u201cthe activities of nonmembers\u201d or\n\u201cthe conduct of non-Indians on fee land.\u201d\n   Given Montana\u2019s \u201c \u2018general proposition that the inherent\nsovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the\nactivities of nonmembers of the tribe,\u2019 \u201d Atkinson, supra, at\n651 (quoting Montana, supra, at 565), efforts by a tribe to\nregulate nonmembers, especially on non-Indian fee land,\nare \u201cpresumptively invalid,\u201d Atkinson, supra, at 659. The\nburden rests on the tribe to establish one of the exceptions\nto Montana\u2019s general rule that would allow an extension of\ntribal authority to regulate nonmembers on non-Indian fee\nland. Atkinson, 532 U. S., at 654. These exceptions are\n\u201climited\u201d ones, id., at 647, and cannot be construed in a\nmanner that would \u201cswallow the rule,\u201d id., at 655, or\n\u201cseverely shrink\u201d it, Strate, 520 U. S., at 458. The Bank\ncontends that neither exception authorizes tribal courts to\nexercise jurisdiction over the Longs\u2019 discrimination claim\nat issue in this case. We agree.\n                         B\n  According to our precedents, \u201ca tribe\u2019s adjudicative\n12   PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v.

We reaffirm that principle today and hold that\nthe Tribal Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the Longs\u2019\ndiscrimination claim because the Tribe lacks the civil\nauthority to regulate the Bank\u2019s sale of its fee land.\n   The Longs\u2019 discrimination claim challenges a non-\nIndian\u2019s sale of non-Indian fee land. Despite the Longs\u2019\nattempt to recharacterize their claim as turning on the\nBank\u2019s alleged \u201cfailure to pay to respondents loans prom-\nised for cattle-raising on tribal trust land,\u201d Brief for Re-\nspondents 47, in fact the Longs brought their discrimina-\ntion claim \u201cseeking to have the land sales set aside on the\nground that the sale to nonmembers \u2018on terms more favor-\nable\u2019 than the bank had extended to the Longs\u201d violated\ntribal tort law, 491 F. 3d, at 882 (quoting Plaintiffs\u2019\nAmended Complaint, App. 173). See also Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 7. That discrimination claim\nthus concerned the sale of a 2,230-acre fee parcel that the\nBank had acquired from the estate of a non-Indian.\n   The status of the land is relevant \u201cinsofar as it bears on\nthe application of . . . Montana\u2019s exceptions to [this] case.\u201d\nHicks, 533 U. S., at 376 (SOUTER, J., concurring). The\nacres at issue here were alienated from the Cheyenne\nRiver Sioux\u2019s tribal trust and converted into fee simple\nparcels as part of the Act of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312,\ncommonly called the 1908 Allotment Act. See Brief for\nRespondents 4, n. 2. While the General Allotment Act\nprovided for the division of tribal land into fee simple\nparcels owned by individual tribal members, that Act also\nmandated that such allotments would be held in trust for\ntheir owners by the United States for a period of 25\nyears\u2014or longer, at the President\u2019s discretion\u2014during\nwhich time the parcel owners had no authority to sell or\nconvey the land.

It \u201cset[s]\nlimits on how nonmembers may engage in commercial\ntransactions,\u201d 491 F. 3d, at 887\u2014and not just any transac-\ntions, but specifically nonmembers\u2019 sale of fee lands they\nown. It regulates the substantive terms on which the\nBank is able to offer its fee land for sale. Respondents and\ntheir principal amicus, the United States, acknowledge\nthat the tribal tort at issue here is a form of regulation.\nSee Brief for Respondents 52; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 25\u201326; see also Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc.,\n552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 11). They argue the\nregulation is fully authorized by the first Montana excep-\ntion. They are mistaken.\n   Montana does not permit Indian tribes to regulate the\nsale of non-Indian fee land. Montana and its progeny\npermit tribal regulation of nonmember conduct inside the\nreservation that implicates the tribe\u2019s sovereign interests.\nMontana expressly limits its first exception to the \u201cactivi-\nties of nonmembers,\u201d 450 U. S., at 565, allowing these to\nbe regulated to the extent necessary \u201cto protect tribal self-\ngovernment [and] to control internal relations,\u201d id., at 564.\nSee Big Horn Cty. Elect.

Each involved regulation of non-Indian activi-\nties on the reservation that had a discernable effect on the\ntribe or its members. The first concerned a tribal court\u2019s\njurisdiction over a contract dispute arising from the sale of\nmerchandise by a non-Indian to an Indian on the reserva-\ntion. See Williams v. Lee, 358 U.

We have upheld as within the\ntribe\u2019s sovereign authority the imposition of a severance\ntax on natural resources removed by nonmembers from\ntribal land. See Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455\nU. S. 130 (1982).

The exception is Brendale v. Confeder-\nated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408,\nand even it fits the general rubric noted above: In that\ncase, we permitted a tribe to restrain particular uses of\nnon-Indian fee land through zoning regulations. While a\nsix-Justice majority held that Montana did not authorize\nthe Yakima Nation to impose zoning regulations on non-\nIndian fee land located in an area of the reservation where\nnearly half the acreage was owned by nonmembers, 492\nU. S., at 430\u2013431 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 444\u2013447\n(opinion of STEVENS, J.), five Justices concluded that\nMontana did permit the Tribe to impose different zoning\nrestrictions on nonmember fee land isolated in \u201cthe heart\nof [a] closed portion of the reservation,\u201d 492 U.

Rather, our Mon-\ntana cases have always concerned nonmember conduct on\nthe land. See, e.g., Hicks, 533 U.

By virtue of their incorporation into the\nUnited States, the tribe\u2019s sovereign interests are now\nconfined to managing tribal land, see Worcester, 6 Pet., at\n561 (persons are allowed to enter Indian land only \u201cwith\nthe assent of the [tribal members] themselves\u201d), \u201cpro-\ntect[ing] tribal self-government,\u201d and \u201ccontrol[ling] inter-\nnal relations,\u201d see Montana, supra, at 564. The logic of\nMontana is that certain activities on non-Indian fee land\n(say, a business enterprise employing tribal members) or\ncertain uses (say, commercial development) may intrude\non the internal relations of the tribe or threaten tribal self-\nrule. To the extent they do, such activities or land uses\nmay be regulated. See Hicks, supra, at 361 (\u201cTribal asser-\ntion of regulatory authority over nonmembers must be\nconnected to that right of the Indians to make their own\nlaws and be governed by them\u201d). Put another way, certain\nforms of nonmember behavior, even on non-Indian fee\nland, may sufficiently affect the tribe as to justify tribal\noversight. While tribes generally have no interest in\nregulating the conduct of nonmembers, then, they may\nregulate nonmember behavior that implicates tribal gov-\nernance and internal relations.\n   The regulations we have approved under Montana all\nflow directly from these limited sovereign interests.

We\nthink the distinction is readily understandable. In any event, the\nquestion is not whether a sale is, in some generic sense, an action. The\nquestion is whether land ownership and sale are \u201cactivities\u201d within the\nmeaning of Montana and the other cited precedents.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

Much\ntaxation can be justified on a similar basis. See Colville,\n447 U.

D. 14, 46 (1934; emphasis added). The power to tax\ncertain nonmember activity can also be justified as \u201ca\nnecessary instrument of self-government and territorial\nmanagement,\u201d Merrion, 455 U.

See post, at 6\u20137. The reason is that\nregulation of the sale of non-Indian fee land, unlike the\nabove, cannot be justified by reference to the tribe\u2019s sover-\neign interests. By definition, fee land owned by nonmem-\nbers has already been removed from the tribe\u2019s immediate\ncontrol. See Strate, 520 U. S., at 456 (tribes lack power to\n\u201cassert [over non-Indian fee land] a landowner\u2019s right to\noccupy and exclude\u201d). It has already been alienated from\nthe tribal trust. The tribe cannot justify regulation of such\nland\u2019s sale by reference to its power to superintend tribal\nland, then, because non-Indian fee parcels have ceased to\nbe tribal land.\n   Nor can regulation of fee land sales be justified by the\ntribe\u2019s interests in protecting internal relations and self-\ngovernment. Any direct harm to its political integrity that\n18   PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                     CATTLE CO.                                 \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe tribe sustains as a result of fee land sale is sustained\nat the point the land passes from Indian to non-Indian\nhands. It is at that point the tribe and its members lose\nthe ability to use the land for their purposes. Once the\nland has been sold in fee simple to non-Indians and passed\nbeyond the tribe\u2019s immediate control, the mere resale of\nthat land works no additional intrusion on tribal relations\nor self-government. Resale, by itself, causes no additional\ndamage.\n   This is not to suggest that the sale of the land will have\nno impact on the tribe. The uses to which the land is put\nmay very well change from owner to owner, and those uses\nmay well affect the tribe and its members. As our cases\nbear out, see supra, at 14\u201316, the tribe may quite legiti-\nmately seek to protect its members from noxious uses that\nthreaten tribal welfare or security, or from nonmember\nconduct on the land that does the same. But the key point\nis that any threat to the tribe\u2019s sovereign interests flows\nfrom changed uses or nonmember activities, rather than\nfrom the mere fact of resale. The tribe is able fully to\nvindicate its sovereign interests in protecting its members\nand preserving tribal self-government by regulating non-\nmember activity on the land, within the limits set forth in\nour cases. The tribe has no independent interest in re-\nstraining alienation of the land itself, and thus, no author-\nity to do so.\n   Not only is regulation of fee land sale beyond the tribe\u2019s\nsovereign powers, it runs the risk of subjecting nonmem-\nbers to tribal regulatory authority without commensurate\nconsent. Tribal sovereignty, it should be remembered, is\n\u201ca sovereignty outside the basic structure of the Constitu-\ntion.\u201d United States v. Lara, 541 U.

And nonmembers have no part in tribal govern-\nment\u2014they have no say in the laws and regulations that\ngovern tribal territory. Consequently, those laws and\nregulations may be fairly imposed on nonmembers only if\nthe nonmember has consented, either expressly or by his\nactions. Even then, the regulation must stem from the\ntribe\u2019s inherent sovereign authority to set conditions on\nentry, preserve tribal self-government, or control internal\nrelations. See Montana, 450 U. S., at 564.\n   In commenting on the policy goals Congress adopted\nwith the General Allotment Act, we noted that \u201c[t]here is\nsimply no suggestion\u201d in the history of the Act \u201cthat Con-\ngress intended that the non-Indians who would settle\nupon alienated allotted lands would be subject to tribal\nregulatory authority.\u201d Id., at 560, n. 9. In fact, we said it\n\u201cdefies common sense to suppose\u201d that Congress meant to\nsubject non-Indians to tribal jurisdiction simply by virtue\nof the nonmember\u2019s purchase of land in fee simple. Ibid.\nIf Congress did not anticipate tribal jurisdiction would run\nwith the land, we see no reason why a nonmember would\nthink so either.\n   The Longs point out that the Bank in this case could\nhardly have been surprised by the Tribe\u2019s assertion of\nregulatory power over the parties\u2019 business dealings. The\nBank, after all, had \u201clengthy on-reservation commercial\nrelationships with the Long Company.\u201d Brief for Respon-\ndents 40. JUSTICE GINSBURG echoes this point. See post,\nat 4. But as we have emphasized repeatedly in this con-\ntext, when it comes to tribal regulatory authority, it is not\n\u201cin for a penny, in for a Pound.\u201d Atkinson, 532 U. S., at\n656 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Bank may\nreasonably have anticipated that its various commercial\ndealings with the Longs could trigger tribal authority to\nregulate those transactions\u2014a question we need not and\ndo not decide. But there is no reason the Bank should\n20   PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                     CATTLE CO.                                 \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhave anticipated that its general business dealings with\nrespondents would permit the Tribe to regulate the Bank\u2019s\nsale of land it owned in fee simple.\n   Even the courts below recognized that the Longs\u2019 dis-\ncrimination claim was a \u201cnovel\u201d one. 491 F. 3d, at 892. It\narose \u201cdirectly from Lakota tradition as embedded in\nCheyenne River Sioux tradition and custom,\u201d including\nthe Lakota \u201csense of justice, fair play and decency to oth-\ners.\u201d 440 F. Supp. 2d, at 1082 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The upshot was to require the Bank to offer the\nsame terms of sale to a prospective buyer who had de-\nfaulted in several previous transactions with the Bank as\nit offered to a different buyer without such a history of\ndefault. This is surely not a typical regulation. But what-\never the Bank anticipated, whatever \u201cconsensual relation-\nship\u201d may have been established through the Bank\u2019s\ndealing with the Longs, the jurisdictional consequences of\nthat relationship cannot extend to the Bank\u2019s subsequent\nsale of its fee land.\n   The Longs acknowledge, if obliquely, the critical impor-\ntance of land status. They emphasize that the Long Com-\npany \u201coperated on reservation fee and trust lands,\u201d Brief\nfor Respondents 40, and n. 24, 41, and note that \u201cthe fee\nland at issue in the lease-repurchase agreement\u201d had\npreviously belonged to a tribal member, id., at 47. These\nfacts, however, do not change the status of the land at the\ntime of the challenged sale. Regardless of where the Long\nCompany operated, the fee land whose sale the Longs seek\nto restrain was owned by the Bank at the relevant time.\nAnd indeed, before that, it was owned by Kenneth Long, a\nnon-Indian. See Hicks, supra, at 382, n. 4 (SOUTER, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cLand status . . . might well have an impact\nunder one (or perhaps both) of the Montana exceptions\u201d),\nAtkinson, supra, at 659 (SOUTER, J., concurring) (status of\nterritory as \u201ctribal or fee land may have much to do (as it\ndoes here) with the likelihood (or not) that facts will exist\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

The Longs\u2019 discrimi-\nnation claim, in short, is an attempt to regulate the terms\non which the Bank may sell the land it owns.3\n   Such regulation is outside the scope of a tribe\u2019s sover-\neign authority.

Post, at 8. First, we\nhave not said the Tribal Court has jurisdiction over the other claims:\nThat question is not before us and we decline to speculate as to its\nanswer. Moreover, the claims on which the Longs prevailed concern\nbreach of a loan agreement, see App. 190, and bad faith in connection\nwith Bureau of Indian Affairs loan guarantees, see id., at 192. The\npresent claim involves substantive regulation of the sale of fee land.\n  3 We point to the relief requested by the Longs\u2014and partially granted\n\nby the Tribal Court\u2014to rebut the Longs\u2019 contention that their claim did\nnot focus on the sale of the fee land. Contrary to JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s\nassertion, however, the nature of this remedy does not drive our juris-\ndictional ruling. See post, at 11\u201312. The remedy is invalid because\nthere is no jurisdiction, not the other way around.\n22   PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v.

Post, at 8. This argument completely overlooks\nthe very reason cases like Montana and this one arise:\nTribal jurisdiction, unlike the jurisdiction of the other\ngovernmental entities cited by JUSTICE GINSBURG, gener-\nally does not extend to nonmembers. See Montana, supra,\nat 565. The sovereign authority of Indian tribes is limited\nin ways state and federal authority is not. Contrary to\nJUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s suggestion, that bedrock principle\ndoes not vary depending on the desirability of a particular\nregulation.\n  Montana provides that, in certain circumstances, tribes\nmay exercise authority over the conduct of nonmembers,\neven if that conduct takes place on non-Indian fee land.\nBut conduct taking place on the land and the sale of the\nland are two very different things. The Cheyenne River\nSioux Tribe lost the authority to restrain the sale of fee\nsimple parcels inside their borders when the land was sold\nas part of the 1908 Allotment Act. Nothing in Montana\ngives it back.\n                              C\n   Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals\nrelied for its decision on the second Montana exception.\nThe Eighth Circuit declined to address the exception\u2019s\napplicability, see 491 F. 3d, at 888, n. 7, while the District\nCourt strongly suggested in passing that the second excep-\ntion would not apply here, see 440 F. Supp. 2d, at 1077.\nThe District Court is correct, for the same reasons we\nexplained above. The second Montana exception stems\nfrom the same sovereign interests that give rise to the\nfirst, interests that do not reach to regulating the sale of\nnon-Indian fee land.\n   The second exception authorizes the tribe to exercise\ncivil jurisdiction when non-Indians\u2019 \u201cconduct\u201d menaces the\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

The\nconduct must do more than injure the tribe, it must \u201cim-\nperil the subsistence\u201d of the tribal community. Ibid. One\ncommentator has noted that \u201cth[e] elevated threshold for\napplication of the second Montana exception suggests that\ntribal power must be necessary to avert catastrophic\nconsequences.\u201d Cohen \u00a74.02[3][c], at 232, n. 220.\n   The sale of formerly Indian-owned fee land to a third\nparty is quite possibly disappointing to the tribe, but\ncannot fairly be called \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for tribal self-\ngovernment. See Strate, 520 U. S., at 459. The land in\nquestion here has been owned by a non-Indian party for at\nleast 50 years, Brief for Respondents 4, during which time\nthe project of tribal self-government has proceeded with-\nout interruption. The land\u2019s resale to another non-Indian\nhardly \u201cimperil[s] the subsistence or welfare of the tribe.\u201d\nMontana, supra, at 566. Accordingly, we hold the second\nMontana exception inapplicable in this case.\n                             D\n   Finally, we address the Longs\u2019 argument that the Bank\nconsented to tribal court jurisdiction over the discrimina-\ntion claim by seeking the assistance of tribal courts in\nserving a notice to quit. Brief for Respondents 44\u201346.\nWhen the Longs refused to vacate the land, the Bank\ninitiated eviction proceedings in South Dakota state court.\nThe Bank then asked the Tribal Court to appoint a process\nserver able to reach the Longs. Seeking the Tribal Court\u2019s\naid in serving process on tribal members for a pending\nstate-court action does not, we think, constitute consent to\nfuture litigation in the Tribal Court. Notably, when the\nLongs did file their complaint against the Bank in Tribal\nCourt, the Bank promptly contended in its answer that\nthe court lacked jurisdiction.

See App. 194\u2013196. That judgment\ndid not disturb the Bank\u2019s sale of fee land to non-Indians.\nIt simply responded to the claim that the Bank, in its on-\nreservation commercial dealings with the Longs, treated\nthem disadvantageously because of their tribal affiliation\nand racial identity. A claim of that genre, I would hold, is\none the Tribal Court is competent to adjudicate. As the\n2    PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v.

While stating\nthe general rule, Montana also identified two exceptions:\n    \u201cA tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or\n    other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter\n    consensual relationships with the tribe or its mem-\n    bers, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or\n    other arrangements. A tribe may also retain inherent\n    power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of\n    non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when\n    that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the\n    political integrity, the economic security, or the health\n    or welfare of the tribe.\u201d Id., at 565\u2013566 (citations\n    omitted).\nThese two exceptions, Montana explained, recognize that\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

See id., at 557. This Court has since clari-\nfied that when a tribe has authority to regulate the activ-\nity of nonmembers, tribal courts presumably have\nadjudicatory authority over disputes arising out of that\nactivity. See Strate v. A\u20131 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438, 453\n(1997) (as to nonmembers, a tribe\u2019s adjudicative jurisdic-\ntion coincides with its legislative jurisdiction).

All Long Company property was situated\u2014\nand all operations of the enterprise occurred\u2014within the\nCheyenne River Sioux Indian Reservation. The Long\nCompany\u2019s articles of incorporation required Indian own-\nership of a majority of the corporation\u2019s shares.

As security for the\nBank\u2019s loans over the years, the Longs mortgaged both\ntheir land and their personal property. The Bank bene-\nfited significantly from the Long Company\u2019s status as an\nIndian-owned business entity, for the BIA loan guarantees\n\u201callowed [it] to greatly reduce its lending risk.\u201d Ibid.\nEventually, the Bank collected from the BIA almost\n$400,000, more than 80% of the net losses resulting from\nits loans to the Longs.

Supp. 2d 1070, 1078 (SD\n2007) (case below); App. 135\u2013138.\n   The discrimination claim here at issue rests on the\nallegedly unfair conditions the Bank exacted from the\nLongs when they sought loans to sustain the operation of\ntheir ranch. Following the death of Ronnie\u2019s father, the\nBank and the Longs entered into an agreement under\nwhich the mortgaged land would be deeded over to the\nBank in exchange for the Bank\u2019s canceling some debt and\nmaking additional loans to keep the ranch in business.\nThe Longs were given a two-year lease on the property\nwith an option to buy the land back when the lease term\nexpired. Negotiating sessions for these arrangements\nwere held at the Tribe\u2019s on-reservation offices and were\nfacilitated by tribal officers and BIA employees. 491 F. 3d,\nat 881.\n   Viewing the deal they were given in comparative light,\nthe Longs charged that the Bank offered to resell ranch\nland to them on terms less advantageous than those the\nBank offered in similar dealings with non-Indians. Their\nclaim, all courts prior to this one found, fit within the\nMontana exception for \u201cactivities of nonmembers who\nenter [into] . . . commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or\nother arrangements\u201d with tribal members. 450 U.

I\nam convinced that the courts below got it right.\n   This case, it bears emphasis, involves no unwitting\noutsider forced to litigate under unfamiliar rules and\nprocedures in tribal court. Cf. Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U. S.\n353, 382\u2013385 (2001) (SOUTER, J., concurring). Hardly a\nstranger to the tribal court system, the Bank regularly\nfiled suit in that forum. See Brief for Cheyenne River\nSioux Tribe as Amicus Curiae 29\u201331. The Bank enlisted\ntribal-court aid to serve notice to quit on the Longs in\nconnection with state-court eviction proceedings. The\nBank later filed a counterclaim for eviction and motion for\nsummary judgment in the case the Longs commenced in\nthe Tribal Court. In its summary judgment motion, the\nBank stated, without qualification, that the Tribal Court\n\u201cha[d] jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action.\u201d\nApp. 187\u2013188. Had the Bank wanted to avoid responding\nin tribal court or the application of tribal law, the means\nwere readily at hand: The Bank could have included forum\nselection, choice-of-law, or arbitration clauses in its\nagreements with the Longs, which the Bank drafted. See\nBrief for Respondents 42.\n                              II\n   Resolving this case on a ground neither argued nor\naddressed below, the Court holds that a tribe may not\nimpose any regulation\u2014not even a nondiscrimination\nrequirement\u2014on a bank\u2019s dealings with tribal members\nregarding on-reservation fee lands. See ante, at 1, 21\u201322.\nI do not read Montana or any other case so to instruct, and\nfind the Court\u2019s position perplexing.\n   First, I question the Court\u2019s separation of land sales tied\n6    PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v.

See, e.g., County of Yakima v.\nConfederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502\nU. S. 251, 269 (1992) (\u201cThe excise tax remains a tax upon\nthe Indian\u2019s activity of selling the land . . . .\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). Cf. 14 Oxford English Dictionary 388 (2d ed.\n1989) (defining \u201csale\u201d as \u201c[t]he action or an act of selling\u201d\n(def. 1(a))).\n   Second, the Court notes the absence of any case\n\u201cf[i]nd[ing] that Montana authorized a tribe to regulate\nthe sale of [non-Indian fee] land.\u201d Ante, at 15. But neither\nhave we held that Montana prohibits all such regulation.\nIf the Court in Montana, or later cases, had intended to\nremove land sales resulting from loan transactions en-\ntirely from tribal governance, it could have spoken plainly\nto that effect. Instead, Montana listed as examples of\nconsensual relationships that tribes might have authority\nto regulate \u201ccommercial dealing, contracts, [and] leases.\u201d\n450 U. S., at 565. Presumably, the reference to \u201cleases\u201d\nincludes leases of fee land. But why should a nonmem-\nber\u2019s lease of fee land to a member be differentiated, for\nMontana exception purposes, from a sale of the same\nland? And why would the enforcement of an antidiscrimi-\nnation command be less important to tribal self-rule and\ndignity, cf. ante, at 16\u201318, when the command relates to\nland sales than when it relates to other commercial rela-\ntionships between nonmembers and members?\n                            III\n   As earlier observed, see supra, at 1, I agree that the\nTribal Court had no authority to grant the Longs an op-\ntion to purchase the 960-acre parcel the Bank had con-\ntracted to sell to individuals unaffiliated with the Tribe.\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

Although the\nTribal Court overstepped in its supplemental judgment\nordering the Bank to give the Longs an option to purchase\nland third parties had contracted to buy, see App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. A\u201369 to A\u201371, it scarcely follows that the Tribal\nCourt lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the Longs\u2019 dis-\ncrimination claim, and to order in its principal judgment,\nsee App. 194\u2013196, monetary relief.1\n   The Court recognizes that \u201c[t]he Bank may reasonably\nhave anticipated that its various commercial dealings with\nthe Longs could trigger tribal authority to regulate those\ntransactions.\u201d Ante, at 19. Today\u2019s decision, furthermore,\npurports to leave the Longs\u2019 breach-of-contract and bad-\nfaith claims untouched. Ante, at 21, n. 2. Noting that the\nBank \u201cdoes not presently challenge the breach-of-contract\nverdict,\u201d ante, at 6, the Court emphasizes that \u201c[o]nly the\ndiscrimination claim is before us and that claim is tied\nspecifically to the sale of the fee land,\u201d ante, at 21. But if\nthe Tribal Court is a proper forum for the Longs\u2019 claim\nthat the Bank has broken its promise or acted deceptively\nin the land-financing transactions at issue, one is hard put\nto understand why the Tribe could not likewise enforce in\nits courts a law that commands: Thou shall not discrimi-\nnate against tribal members in the terms and conditions\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Longs joined their discrimination claim with claims of breach of\n\ncontract and bad-faith dealings. The jury found in favor of the Longs\non all three claims. App. 190\u2013192. The latter claims alleged that the\nBank \u201cnever provided the . . . operating loans\u201d promised during the\nparties\u2019 negotiations. 491 F. 3d 878, 882 (CA8 2007). \u201c[A]s a result,\u201d\nthe Longs asserted, \u201cthe company was not able [to] sustain its ranching\noperation through the particularly harsh winter of 1996\u201397.\u201d Ibid.\nNothing in the Court\u2019s opinion precludes decision of those claims by the\nTribal Court.

Why should the Tribe\nlack comparable authority to shield its members against\ndiscrimination by those engaging in on-reservation com-\nmercial relationships\u2014including land-secured lending\u2014\nwith them?\n                                A\n  The \u201cfighting issue\u201d in the tribal trial court, the Eighth\nCircuit underscored, \u201cwas whether the bank denied the\nLongs favorable terms on a deal solely on the basis of their\nrace or tribal affiliation.\u201d 491 F. 3d, at 891. The Longs\nmaintained that the Bank initially offered them more\nfavorable terms, proposing to sell the mortgaged land back\nto them with a 20-year contract for deed. Thereafter, the\nBank sent a letter to Ronnie Long withdrawing its initial\noffer, \u201cciting \u2018possible jurisdictional problems\u2019 posed by the\nLong Company\u2019s status as an \u2018Indian owned entity on the\nreservation.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 882 (quoting Letter from Charles\nSimon, Vice President, Bank of Hoven, to Ronnie Long\n(Apr. 26, 1996), App. 91). In the final agreement, the\nBank promised no long-term financing; instead, it gave the\nLongs only a two-year lease with an option to purchase\nthat required a large balloon payment within 60 days of\nthe lease\u2019s expiration. When the Longs were unable to\nmake the required payment within the specified deadline,\nthe Bank sold the land to nonmembers on more favorable\nterms.\n  In their complaint, the Longs alleged that the Bank\nallowed the non-Indians \u201cten years to pay for the land, but\nthe bank would not permit [the] Longs even 60 days to pay\nfor their land,\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch unfair discrimination by\nthe bank prevented the Longs and the [Long] Company\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

Rather, as the tribal trial\ncourt observed, the contracts with nonmembers simply\nsupplied \u201cevidence that the Bank denied the Longs the\nprivilege of contracting for a deed because of their status\nas tribal members.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u201378 to A\u201379\n(emphasis added).\n   The Tribal Court instructed the jury to hold the Bank\nliable on the discrimination claim only if the less favorable\nterms given to the Longs rested \u201csolely\u201d upon the Longs\u2019\n\u201crace or tribal identity.\u201d 491 F. 3d, at 883 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). In response to a special interroga-\ntory, the jury found that \u201cthe Defendant Bank intention-\nally discriminate[d] against the Plaintiffs Ronnie and Lila\nLong [in the lease with option to purchase] based solely\nupon their status as Indians or tribal members.\u201d App.\n191. Neither the instruction nor the special finding neces-\nsitated regulation of, or interference with, the Bank\u2019s fee-\nland sales to non-Indian individuals. See ante, at 1.2\n   Tellingly, the Bank\u2019s principal jurisdictional argument\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The  Court criticizes the Tribal Court for \u201crequir[ing] the Bank to\noffer the same terms of sale to a prospective buyer who had defaulted in\nseveral previous transactions with the Bank as it offered to a different\nbuyer without such a history of default.\u201d Ante, at 20. That criticism is\nunfair. First, the record does not confirm that the Longs were riskier\nbuyers than the nonmembers to whom the Bank eventually sold the\nland. Overlooked by the Court, the Bank\u2019s loans to the Longs were\nsheltered by BIA loan guarantees. See supra, at 3\u20134. Further, a\ndetermination that the Longs had encountered intentional discrimina-\ntion based solely on their status as tribal members in no way inhibited\nthe Bank from differentiating evenhandedly among borrowers based on\ntheir creditworthiness. The proscription of discrimination simply\nrequired the Bank to offer the Longs the same terms it would have\noffered similarly situated non-Indians.\n10     PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                       CATTLE CO.                                          \n\n                   Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nbelow bore no relationship to the position the Court em-\nbraces. The Bank recognized that the Longs were indeed\ncomplaining about discriminatory conduct of a familiar\nsort. Cf. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409, 413\n(1968) (42 U. S. C. \u00a71982 \u201cbars all racial discrimination\n. . . in the sale or rental of property\u201d). In Hicks, 533 U. S.\n353, this Court held that tribal courts could not exercise\njurisdiction over a claim arising under federal law, in that\ncase, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Relying on Hicks, the Bank in-\nsisted that the Longs\u2019 discrimination claim could not be\nheard in tribal court because it arose under well-known\nfederal antidiscrimination law, specifically, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71981 or \u00a72000d. 491 F. 3d, at 882\u2013883. The Tribal Court\nof Appeals, however, held that the claim arose under\nLakota common law, which resembled federal and state\nantidiscrimination measures. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u2013\n54 to A\u201355, and n. 5.3\n                          B\n  The Longs requested a remedy the Tribal Court did not\nhave authority to grant\u2014namely, an option to repurchase\nland the Bank had already contracted to sell to nonmem-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The Court types the Longs\u2019 discrimination claim as \u201c \u2018novel,\u2019 \u201d ante,\n\nat 20 (quoting 491 F. 3d, at 892), because the Tribal Court of Appeals\nderived the applicable law \u201c \u2018directly from Lakota tradition,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 20\n(quoting 440 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1082 (SD 2007) (case below)). Concern-\ning the content of the Tribe\u2019s law, however, the appeals court drew not\nonly from \u201cTribal tradition and custom,\u201d it also looked to federal and\nstate law. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u201355. Just as state courts may\ndraw upon federal law when appropriate, see, e.g., Dawson v. Bi-\nrenbaum, 968 S. W. 2d 663, 666\u2013667 (Ky. 1998), and federal courts may\nlook to state law to fill gaps, see, e.g., United States v. Kimbell Foods,\nInc., 440 U. S. 715, 728\u2013730 (1979), so too may tribal courts \u201cborrow\nfrom the law of . . . the federal government,\u201d see F. Cohen, Handbook of\nFederal Indian Law \u00a74.05[1], p. 275 (2005 ed.).

Argued April 14, 2008\u2014Decided June 25, 2008\nPetitioner Plains Commerce Bank (Bank), a non-Indian bank, sold land\n  it owned in fee simple on a tribal reservation to non-Indians. Re-\n  spondents the Longs, an Indian couple who had been leasing the land\n  with an option to purchase, claim the Bank discriminated against\n  them by selling the parcel to nonmembers of the Tribe on terms more\n  favorable than the Bank offered to sell it to them. The couple sued in\n  Tribal Court, asserting, inter alia, discrimination, breach-of-contract,\n  and bad-faith claims. Over the Bank\u2019s objection, the Tribal Court\n  concluded that it had jurisdiction and proceeded to trial, where a jury\n  ruled against the Bank on three claims, including the discrimination\n  claim. The court awarded the Longs damages plus interest. In a\n  supplemental judgment, the court also gave the Longs an option to\n  purchase that portion of the fee land they still occupied, nullifying\n  the Bank\u2019s sale of the land to non-Indians. After the Tribal Court of\n  Appeals affirmed, the Bank filed suit in Federal District Court, con-\n  tending that the tribal judgment was null and void because, as rele-\n  vant here, the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction over the Longs\u2019 dis-\n  crimination claim. The District Court granted the Longs summary\n  judgment, finding tribal court jurisdiction proper because the Bank\u2019s\n  consensual relationship with the Longs and their company (also a re-\n  spondent here) brought the Bank within the first category of tribal\n  civil jurisdiction over nonmembers outlined in Montana v. United\n  States, 450 U. S. 544. The Eighth Circuit affirmed, concluding that\n  the Tribe had authority to regulate the business conduct of persons\n  voluntarily dealing with tribal members, including a nonmember\u2019s\n  sale of fee land.\n2      PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                      CATTLE CO.                                          \n\n                        Syllabus \n\n\nHeld:\n    1. The Bank has Article III standing to pursue this challenge. Both\n with respect to damages and the option to purchase, the Bank was\n \u201cinjured in fact,\u201d see Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555,\n 560, by the Tribal Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the discrimina-\n tion claim. This Court is unpersuaded by the Longs\u2019 claim that the\n damages award was premised entirely on their breach-of-contract\n verdict, which the Bank has not challenged, rather than on their dis-\n crimination claim. Because the verdict form allowed the jury to make\n a damages award after finding liability as to any of the individual\n claims, the jury could have based its damages award, in whole or in\n part, on the discrimination finding. The Bank was also injured by\n the option to purchase. Only the Longs\u2019 discrimination claim sought\n deed to the land as relief. The fact that the remedial purchase option\n applied only to a portion of the total parcel does not eliminate the in-\n jury to the Bank, which had no obligation to sell any of the land to\n the Longs before the Tribal Court\u2019s judgment. That judgment effec-\n tively nullified a portion of the sale to a third party. These injuries\n can be remedied by a ruling that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction\n and that its judgment on the discrimination claim is null and void.\n Pp. 5\u20138.\n    2. The Tribal Court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate a dis-\n crimination claim concerning the non-Indian Bank\u2019s sale of its fee\n land. Pp. 8\u201324.\n       (a) The general rule that tribes do not possess authority over\n non-Indians who come within their borders, Montana v. United\n States, 450 U. S. 564, 565, restricts tribal authority over nonmember\n activities taking place on the reservation, and is particularly strong\n when the nonmember\u2019s activity occurs on land owned in fee simple by\n non-Indians, Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438, 446. Once\n tribal land is converted into fee simple, the tribe loses plenary juris-\n diction over it. See County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and\n Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 267\u2013268. Moreover, when\n the tribe or its members convey fee land to third parties, the tribe\n \u201closes any former right of absolute and exclusive use and occupation\n of the conveyed lands.\u201d South Dakota v. Bourland, 508 U. S. 679,\n 689. Thus, \u201cthe tribe has no authority itself . . . to regulate the use of\n fee land.\u201d Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Na-\n tion, 492 U. S. 408, 430. Montana provides two exceptions under\n which tribes may exercise \u201ccivil jurisdiction over non-Indians on their\n reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands,\u201d 450 U. S., at 565: (1) \u201cA\n tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the\n activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with\n the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts,\n                   Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nleases, or other arrangements,\u201d ibid.; and (2) a tribe may exercise\n\u201ccivil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within\nthe reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect\non the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or wel-\nfare of the tribe,\u201d id., at 566. Neither exception authorizes tribal\ncourts to exercise jurisdiction over the Longs\u2019 discrimination claim.\nPp. 8\u201311.\n     (b) The Tribal Court lacks jurisdiction to hear that claim because\nthe Tribe lacks the civil authority to regulate the Bank\u2019s sale of its\nfee land, and \u201ca tribe\u2019s adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its\nlegislative jurisdiction,\u201d Strate, supra, at 453. Montana does not\npermit tribes to regulate the sale of non-Indian fee land. Rather, it\npermits tribal regulation of nonmember conduct inside the reserva-\ntion that implicates the tribe\u2019s sovereign interests. 450 U. S., at 564\u2013\n565. With only one exception, see Brendale, supra, this Court has\nnever \u201cupheld under Montana the extension of tribal civil authority\nover nonmembers on non-Indian land,\u201d Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U. S.\n353, 360. Nor has the Court found that Montana authorized a tribe\nto regulate the sale of such land. This makes good sense, given the\nlimited nature of tribal sovereignty and the liberty interests of non-\nmembers. Tribal sovereign interests are confined to managing tribal\nland, see Worcester v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85797\"><a href=\"/opinion/85797/worcester-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561, protecting tribal self-\ngovernment, and controlling internal relations, see Montana, supra,\nat 564. Regulations approved under Montana all flow from these lim-\nited interests. See, e.g., Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676, 696. None of\nthese interests justified tribal regulation of a nonmember\u2019s sale of fee\nland. The Tribe cannot justify regulation of the sale of non-Indian fee\nland by reference to its power to superintend tribal land because non-\nIndian fee parcels have ceased to be tribal land. Nor can regulation\nof fee land sales be justified by the Tribe\u2019s interest in protecting in-\nternal relations and self-government. Any direct harm sustained be-\ncause of a fee land sale is sustained at the point the land passes from\nIndian to non-Indian hands. Resale, by itself, causes no additional\ndamage. Regulating fee land sales also runs the risk of subjecting\nnonmembers to tribal regulatory authority without their consent.\nBecause the Bill of Rights does not apply to tribes and because non-\nmembers have no say in the laws and regulations governing tribal\nterritory, tribal laws and regulations may be applied only to non-\nmembers who have consented to tribal authority, expressly or by ac-\ntion. Even then the regulation must stem from the tribe\u2019s inherent\nsovereign authority to set conditions on entry, preserve self-\ngovernment, or control internal relations. There is no reason the\nBank should have anticipated that its general business dealings with\nthe Longs would permit the Tribe to regulate the Bank\u2019s sale of land\n4        PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v.

The couple sued on that claim in tribal\ncourt; the bank contested the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The\ntribal court concluded that it had jurisdiction and pro-\nceeded to hear the case. It ultimately ruled against the\nbank and awarded the Indian couple damages and the\nright to purchase a portion of the fee land. The question\npresented is whether the tribal court had jurisdiction to\nadjudicate a discrimination claim concerning the non-\nIndian bank\u2019s sale of fee land it owned. We hold that it\ndid not.\n                         I\n  The Long Family Land and Cattle Company, Inc. (Long\n2    PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                     CATTLE CO.                           \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nCompany or Company), is a family-run ranching and\nfarming operation incorporated under the laws of South\nDakota. Its lands are located on the Cheyenne River\nSioux Indian Reservation. Once a massive, 60-million\nacre affair, the reservation was appreciably diminished by\nCongress in the 1880s and at present consists of roughly\n11 million acres located in Dewey and Ziebach Counties in\nnorth-central South Dakota. The Long Company is a\nrespondent here, along with Ronnie and Lila Long, hus-\nband and wife, who together own at least 51 percent of the\nCompany\u2019s shares. Ronnie and Lila Long are both en-\nrolled members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian Tribe.\n   The Longs and their Company have been customers for\nmany years at Plains Commerce Bank (Bank), located\nsome 25 miles off the reservation as the crow flies in Ho-\nven, South Dakota. The Bank, like the Long Company, is\na South Dakota corporation, but has no ties to the reserva-\ntion other than its business dealings with tribal members.\nThe Bank made its first commercial loan to the Long\nCompany in 1989, and a series of agreements followed. As\npart of those agreements, Kenneth Long\u2014Ronnie Long\u2019s\nfather and a non-Indian\u2014mortgaged to the Bank 2,230\nacres of fee land he owned inside the reservation. At the\ntime of Kenneth Long\u2019s death in the summer of 1995,\nKenneth and the Long Company owed the Bank $750,000.\n   In the spring of 1996, Ronnie and Lila Long began\nnegotiating a new loan contract with the Bank in an effort\nto shore up their Company\u2019s flagging financial fortunes\nand come to terms with their outstanding debts. After\nseveral months of back-and-forth, the parties finally\nreached an agreement in December of that year\u2014two\nagreements, to be precise. The Company and the Bank\nsigned a fresh loan contract, according to which Kenneth\nLong\u2019s estate deeded over the previously mortgaged fee\nacreage to the Bank in lieu of foreclosure. App. 104. In\nreturn, the Bank agreed to cancel some of the Company\u2019s\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndebt and to make additional operating loans. The parties\nalso agreed to a lease arrangement: The Company re-\nceived a two-year lease on the 2,230 acres, deeded over to\nthe Bank, with an option to purchase the land at the end\nof the term for $468,000. Id., at 96\u2013103.\n   It is at this point, the Longs claim, that the Bank began\ntreating them badly. The Longs say the Bank initially\noffered more favorable purchase terms in the lease agree-\nment, allegedly proposing to sell the land back to the\nLongs with a 20-year contract for deed. The Bank eventu-\nally rescinded that offer, the Longs claim, citing \u201c \u2018possible\njurisdictional problems\u2019 \u201d that might have been caused by\nthe Bank financing an \u201c \u2018Indian owned entity on the reser-\nvation.\u2019 \u201d 491 F. 3d 878, 882 (CA8 2007) (case below).\n   Then came the punishing winter of 1996\u20131997. The\nLongs lost over 500 head of cattle in the blizzards that\nseason, with the result that the Long Company was un-\nable to exercise its option to purchase the leased acreage\nwhen the lease contract expired in 1998. Nevertheless,\nthe Longs refused to vacate the property, prompting the\nBank to initiate eviction proceedings in state court and to\npetition the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Court to serve\nthe Longs with a notice to quit. In the meantime, the\nBank sold 320 acres of the fee land it owned to a non-\nIndian couple. In June 1999, while the Longs continued to\noccupy a 960-acre parcel of the land, the Bank sold the\nremaining 1,910 acres to two other nonmembers.\n   In July 1999, the Longs and the Long Company filed\nsuit against the Bank in the Tribal Court, seeking an\ninjunction to prevent their eviction from the property and\nto reverse the sale of the land. They asserted a variety of\nclaims, including breach of contract, bad faith, violation of\ntribal-law self-help remedies, and discrimination. The\ndiscrimination claim alleged that the Bank sold the land\nto nonmembers on terms more favorable than those of-\nfered the Company. The Bank asserted in its answer that\n4    PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                     CATTLE CO.                                \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe court lacked jurisdiction and also stated a counter-\nclaim. The Tribal Court found that it had jurisdiction,\ndenied the Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its\ncounterclaim, and proceeded to trial. Four causes of ac-\ntion were submitted to the seven-member jury: breach of\ncontract, bad faith, violation of self-help remedies, and\ndiscrimination.\n   The jury found for the Longs on three of the four causes,\nincluding the discrimination claim, and awarded a\n$750,000 general verdict. After denying the Bank\u2019s post-\ntrial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict by\nfinding again that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the\nLongs\u2019 claims, the Tribal Court entered judgment award-\ning the Longs $750,000 plus interest. A later supplemen-\ntal judgment further awarded the Longs an option to\npurchase the 960 acres of the land they still occupied on\nthe terms offered in the original purchase option, effec-\ntively nullifying the Bank\u2019s previous sale of that land to\nnon-Indians.\n   The Bank appealed to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal\nCourt of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the trial\ncourt. The Bank then filed the instant action in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of South\nDakota, seeking a declaration that the tribal judgment\nwas null and void because, as relevant here, the Tribal\nCourt lacked jurisdiction over the Longs\u2019 discrimination\nclaim. The District Court granted summary judgment to\nthe Longs. The court found tribal court jurisdiction proper\nbecause the Bank had entered into a consensual relation-\nship with the Longs and the Long Company. 440 F. Supp.\n2d 1070, 1077\u20131078, 1080\u20131081 (SD 2006). According to\nthe District Court, this relationship brought the Bank\nwithin the first category of tribal civil jurisdiction over\nnonmembers outlined in Montana v. United States, 450\nU. S. 544 (1981). \tSee 440 F. Supp. 2d, at 1077\u20131078.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

The Longs\u2019 discrimination claim, the court\nheld, \u201carose directly from their preexisting commercial\nrelationship with the bank.\u201d Id., at 887. When the Bank\nchose to deal with the Longs, it effectively consented to\nsubstantive regulation by the tribe: An antidiscrimination\ntort claim was just another way of regulating the commer-\ncial transactions between the parties. See ibid. In sum,\nthe Tribe had authority to regulate the business conduct of\npersons who \u201cvoluntarily deal with tribal members,\u201d in-\ncluding, here, a nonmember\u2019s sale of fee land. Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n   Before considering the Tribal Court\u2019s authority to adju-\ndicate the discrimination claim, we must first address the\nLongs\u2019 contention that the Bank lacks standing to raise\nthis jurisdictional challenge in the first place. Though the\nLongs raised their standing argument for the first time\nbefore this Court, we bear an independent obligation to\nassure ourselves that jurisdiction is proper before proceed-\ning to the merits. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Envi-\nronment, 523 U. S. 83, 94\u201395 (1998).\n   We begin by noting that whether a tribal court has\nadjudicative authority over nonmembers is a federal ques-\ntion. See Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U. S. 9, 15\n(1987); National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe,\n471 U. S. 845, 852\u2013853 (1985). If the tribal court is found\nto lack such jurisdiction, any judgment as to the nonmem-\nber is necessarily null and void. The Longs do not contest\nthis settled principle but argue instead that the Bank has\nsuffered no \u201cinjury in fact\u201d as required by Article III\u2019s\ncase-or-controversy provision. See Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992).\n   The Longs appear to recognize their argument is some-\nwhat counterintuitive. They concede the jury found the\n6    PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                     CATTLE CO.                                \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBank guilty of discrimination and awarded them $750,000\nplus interest. But the Longs contend the jury\u2019s damages\naward was in fact premised entirely on their breach-of-\ncontract rather than on their discrimination claim. The\nBank does not presently challenge the breach-of-contract\nverdict.\n   In support of their argument, the Longs point to their\namended complaint in the Tribal Court. The complaint\ncomprised nine counts. Several of the counts sought dam-\nages; the discrimination count did not. As relief for the\ndiscrimination claim, the Longs asked to be granted \u201cpos-\nsession and title to their land.\u201d App. 173. The Longs\ncontend that the damage award therefore had nothing to\ndo with the discrimination claim. As a result, a decision\nfrom this Court finding no jurisdiction with respect to that\nclaim\u2014the only claim the Bank appeals\u2014would not\nchange anything.\n   We are not persuaded. The jury verdict form consisted\nof six special interrogatories, covering each claim asserted\nagainst the Bank, with another one covering the amount\nof damages to be awarded. Id., at 190\u2013192. The damages\ninterrogatory specifically allowed the jury to make an\naward after finding liability as to any of the individual\nclaims: \u201cIf you answered yes to Numbers 1, 3, 4, or 5 what\namount of damages should be awarded to the Plaintiffs?\u201d\nId., at 192 (emphasis added). The jury found against the\nBank on three of the special interrogatories, including\nnumber 4, the discrimination claim. The Bank, the jurors\nfound, \u201cintentionally discriminate[d] against the Plaintiffs\nRonnie and Lila Long.\u201d Id., at 191. The jury then entered\nan award of $750,000. Id., at 192. These facts establish\nthat the jury could have based its damages award, in\nwhole or in part, on the finding of discrimination.\n   There is, in addition, the option to purchase. The Longs\nargue that requiring the Bank to void the sale to non-\nmembers of a 960\u2013acre parcel and sell that parcel to them\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninstead does not constitute injury-in-fact, because the\nTribal Court actually denied the relief the Longs sought\nfor the Bank\u2019s discrimination. In its supplemental judg-\nment, the Tribal Court refused to permit the Longs (or the\nLong Company) to purchase all the land\u2014as they had\nrequested\u2014instead granting an option to purchase only\nthe 960 acres the Longs occupied at the time. See Sup-\nplemental Judgment in No. R\u2013120\u201399, Long Family Land\n& Cattle Co. v. Maciejewski, (Feb. 18, 2003), App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. A\u201369 to A\u201370. Even this partial relief, the Longs\ninsist, was crafted as an equitable remedy for their\nbreach-of-contract claim, see Brief for Respondents 32\u201334,\nand in any event the Bank really suffered no harm, be-\ncause it would gain as much income selling to the Longs as\nit did selling to the nonmembers, see id., at 34\u201335.\n   These arguments do not defeat the Bank\u2019s standing.\nThe Longs requested, as a remedy for the alleged dis-\ncrimination, \u201cpossession and title\u201d to the subject land.\nApp. 173. They received an option to acquire a portion of\nexactly that. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u201369 to A\u201370. The\nTribal Court\u2019s silence in its supplemental judgment as to\nwhich claim, exactly, the option to purchase was meant to\nremedy is immaterial. See ibid. Of the four claims pre-\nsented to the jury, only the discrimination claim sought\ndeed to the land as relief. See Amended Complaint (Jan.\n3, 2000), App. 158, 173. Nor does the fact that the reme-\ndial purchase option applied only to a portion of the total\nparcel eliminate the Bank\u2019s injury. The Bank had no\nobligation to sell the land to the Longs before the Tribal\nCourt\u2019s judgment\u2014indeed, the Bank had already sold the\nacreage to third parties. The Tribal Court judgment effec-\ntively nullified a portion of that sale. This judicially im-\nposed burden certainly qualifies as an injury for standing\npurposes. As for the Longs\u2019 speculation that the Bank\nwould make as much money selling the land to them as it\ndid selling the parcel to nonmembers, the argument is\n8    PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                     CATTLE CO.                                  \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nentirely beside the point. There is more than adequate\ninjury in being compelled to undo one deed and enter into\nanother\u2014particularly with individuals who had previously\ndefaulted on loans.\n   Both with respect to damages and the option to pur-\nchase, the Bank was injured by the Tribal Court\u2019s exercise\nof jurisdiction over the discrimination claim. Those inju-\nries can be remedied by a ruling in favor of the Bank that\nthe Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction and that its judgment\non the discrimination claim is null and void. The ultimate\ncollateral consequence of such a determination, whatever\nit may be\u2014vacatur of the general damages award, vacatur\nof the option to purchase, a new trial on the other claims\u2014\ndoes not alter the fact that the Bank has shown injury\ntraceable to the challenged action and likely to be re-\ndressed by a favorable ruling.

They may also exclude outsiders from\nentering tribal land. See Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676,\n696\u2013697 (1990).

(hereinafter Cohen).\n   Our cases have made clear that once tribal land is con-\nverted into fee simple, the tribe loses plenary jurisdiction\nover it. See County of Yakima, supra, at 267\u2013268 (General\nAllotment Act permits Yakima County to impose\nad valorem tax on fee land located within the reservation);\nGoudy v. Meath, 203 U.

S., at 565. First, \u201c[a]\ntribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other\nmeans, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual\nrelationships with the tribe or its members, through com-\nmercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements.\u201d\nIbid. Second, a tribe may exercise \u201ccivil authority over the\nconduct of non-Indians on fee lands within the reservation\nwhen that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on\nthe political integrity, the economic security, or the health\nor welfare of the tribe.\u201d Id., at 566. These rules have\nbecome known as the Montana exceptions, after the case\nthat elaborated them. By their terms, the exceptions\nconcern regulation of \u201cthe activities of nonmembers\u201d or\n\u201cthe conduct of non-Indians on fee land.\u201d\n   Given Montana\u2019s \u201c \u2018general proposition that the inherent\nsovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the\nactivities of nonmembers of the tribe,\u2019 \u201d Atkinson, supra, at\n651 (quoting Montana, supra, at 565), efforts by a tribe to\nregulate nonmembers, especially on non-Indian fee land,\nare \u201cpresumptively invalid,\u201d Atkinson, supra, at 659. The\nburden rests on the tribe to establish one of the exceptions\nto Montana\u2019s general rule that would allow an extension of\ntribal authority to regulate nonmembers on non-Indian fee\nland. Atkinson, 532 U. S., at 654. These exceptions are\n\u201climited\u201d ones, id., at 647, and cannot be construed in a\nmanner that would \u201cswallow the rule,\u201d id., at 655, or\n\u201cseverely shrink\u201d it, Strate, 520 U.

We reaffirm that principle today and hold that\nthe Tribal Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the Longs\u2019\ndiscrimination claim because the Tribe lacks the civil\nauthority to regulate the Bank\u2019s sale of its fee land.\n   The Longs\u2019 discrimination claim challenges a non-\nIndian\u2019s sale of non-Indian fee land. Despite the Longs\u2019\nattempt to recharacterize their claim as turning on the\nBank\u2019s alleged \u201cfailure to pay to respondents loans prom-\nised for cattle-raising on tribal trust land,\u201d Brief for Re-\nspondents 47, in fact the Longs brought their discrimina-\ntion claim \u201cseeking to have the land sales set aside on the\nground that the sale to nonmembers \u2018on terms more favor-\nable\u2019 than the bank had extended to the Longs\u201d violated\ntribal tort law, 491 F. 3d, at 882 (quoting Plaintiffs\u2019\nAmended Complaint, App. 173). See also Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 7. That discrimination claim\nthus concerned the sale of a 2,230-acre fee parcel that the\nBank had acquired from the estate of a non-Indian.\n   The status of the land is relevant \u201cinsofar as it bears on\nthe application of . . . Montana\u2019s exceptions to [this] case.\u201d\nHicks, 533 U. S., at 376 (SOUTER, J., concurring). The\nacres at issue here were alienated from the Cheyenne\nRiver Sioux\u2019s tribal trust and converted into fee simple\nparcels as part of the Act of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312,\ncommonly called the 1908 Allotment Act. See Brief for\nRespondents 4, n. 2. While the General Allotment Act\nprovided for the division of tribal land into fee simple\nparcels owned by individual tribal members, that Act also\nmandated that such allotments would be held in trust for\ntheir owners by the United States for a period of 25\nyears\u2014or longer, at the President\u2019s discretion\u2014during\nwhich time the parcel owners had no authority to sell or\nconvey the land.

It regulates the substantive terms on which the\nBank is able to offer its fee land for sale.

Medtronic, Inc.,\n552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 11). They argue the\nregulation is fully authorized by the first Montana excep-\ntion. They are mistaken.\n   Montana does not permit Indian tribes to regulate the\nsale of non-Indian fee land. Montana and its progeny\npermit tribal regulation of nonmember conduct inside the\nreservation that implicates the tribe\u2019s sovereign interests.\nMontana expressly limits its first exception to the \u201cactivi-\nties of nonmembers,\u201d 450 U.

The exception is Brendale v. Confeder-\nated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408,\nand even it fits the general rubric noted above: In that\ncase, we permitted a tribe to restrain particular uses of\nnon-Indian fee land through zoning regulations. While a\nsix-Justice majority held that Montana did not authorize\nthe Yakima Nation to impose zoning regulations on non-\nIndian fee land located in an area of the reservation where\nnearly half the acreage was owned by nonmembers, 492\nU. S., at 430\u2013431 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 444\u2013447\n(opinion of STEVENS, J.), five Justices concluded that\nMontana did permit the Tribe to impose different zoning\nrestrictions on nonmember fee land isolated in \u201cthe heart\nof [a] closed portion of the reservation,\u201d 492 U.

Rather, our Mon-\ntana cases have always concerned nonmember conduct on\nthe land. See, e.g., Hicks, 533 U.

By virtue of their incorporation into the\nUnited States, the tribe\u2019s sovereign interests are now\nconfined to managing tribal land, see Worcester, 6 Pet., at\n561 (persons are allowed to enter Indian land only \u201cwith\nthe assent of the [tribal members] themselves\u201d), \u201cpro-\ntect[ing] tribal self-government,\u201d and \u201ccontrol[ling] inter-\nnal relations,\u201d see Montana, supra, at 564. The logic of\nMontana is that certain activities on non-Indian fee land\n(say, a business enterprise employing tribal members) or\ncertain uses (say, commercial development) may intrude\non the internal relations of the tribe or threaten tribal self-\nrule. To the extent they do, such activities or land uses\nmay be regulated. See Hicks, supra, at 361 (\u201cTribal asser-\ntion of regulatory authority over nonmembers must be\nconnected to that right of the Indians to make their own\nlaws and be governed by them\u201d). Put another way, certain\nforms of nonmember behavior, even on non-Indian fee\nland, may sufficiently affect the tribe as to justify tribal\noversight. While tribes generally have no interest in\nregulating the conduct of nonmembers, then, they may\nregulate nonmember behavior that implicates tribal gov-\nernance and internal relations.\n   The regulations we have approved under Montana all\nflow directly from these limited sovereign interests.

We\nthink the distinction is readily understandable. In any event, the\nquestion is not whether a sale is, in some generic sense, an action. The\nquestion is whether land ownership and sale are \u201cactivities\u201d within the\nmeaning of Montana and the other cited precedents.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

Much\ntaxation can be justified on a similar basis. See Colville,\n447 U.

D. 14, 46 (1934; emphasis added). The power to tax\ncertain nonmember activity can also be justified as \u201ca\nnecessary instrument of self-government and territorial\nmanagement,\u201d Merrion, 455 U.

See post, at 6\u20137. The reason is that\nregulation of the sale of non-Indian fee land, unlike the\nabove, cannot be justified by reference to the tribe\u2019s sover-\neign interests. By definition, fee land owned by nonmem-\nbers has already been removed from the tribe\u2019s immediate\ncontrol. See Strate, 520 U. S., at 456 (tribes lack power to\n\u201cassert [over non-Indian fee land] a landowner\u2019s right to\noccupy and exclude\u201d). It has already been alienated from\nthe tribal trust. The tribe cannot justify regulation of such\nland\u2019s sale by reference to its power to superintend tribal\nland, then, because non-Indian fee parcels have ceased to\nbe tribal land.\n   Nor can regulation of fee land sales be justified by the\ntribe\u2019s interests in protecting internal relations and self-\ngovernment. Any direct harm to its political integrity that\n18   PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                     CATTLE CO.                                 \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe tribe sustains as a result of fee land sale is sustained\nat the point the land passes from Indian to non-Indian\nhands. It is at that point the tribe and its members lose\nthe ability to use the land for their purposes. Once the\nland has been sold in fee simple to non-Indians and passed\nbeyond the tribe\u2019s immediate control, the mere resale of\nthat land works no additional intrusion on tribal relations\nor self-government. Resale, by itself, causes no additional\ndamage.\n   This is not to suggest that the sale of the land will have\nno impact on the tribe. The uses to which the land is put\nmay very well change from owner to owner, and those uses\nmay well affect the tribe and its members. As our cases\nbear out, see supra, at 14\u201316, the tribe may quite legiti-\nmately seek to protect its members from noxious uses that\nthreaten tribal welfare or security, or from nonmember\nconduct on the land that does the same. But the key point\nis that any threat to the tribe\u2019s sovereign interests flows\nfrom changed uses or nonmember activities, rather than\nfrom the mere fact of resale. The tribe is able fully to\nvindicate its sovereign interests in protecting its members\nand preserving tribal self-government by regulating non-\nmember activity on the land, within the limits set forth in\nour cases. The tribe has no independent interest in re-\nstraining alienation of the land itself, and thus, no author-\nity to do so.\n   Not only is regulation of fee land sale beyond the tribe\u2019s\nsovereign powers, it runs the risk of subjecting nonmem-\nbers to tribal regulatory authority without commensurate\nconsent.

And nonmembers have no part in tribal govern-\nment\u2014they have no say in the laws and regulations that\ngovern tribal territory. Consequently, those laws and\nregulations may be fairly imposed on nonmembers only if\nthe nonmember has consented, either expressly or by his\nactions. Even then, the regulation must stem from the\ntribe\u2019s inherent sovereign authority to set conditions on\nentry, preserve tribal self-government, or control internal\nrelations. See Montana, 450 U. S., at 564.\n   In commenting on the policy goals Congress adopted\nwith the General Allotment Act, we noted that \u201c[t]here is\nsimply no suggestion\u201d in the history of the Act \u201cthat Con-\ngress intended that the non-Indians who would settle\nupon alienated allotted lands would be subject to tribal\nregulatory authority.\u201d Id., at 560, n. 9. In fact, we said it\n\u201cdefies common sense to suppose\u201d that Congress meant to\nsubject non-Indians to tribal jurisdiction simply by virtue\nof the nonmember\u2019s purchase of land in fee simple. Ibid.\nIf Congress did not anticipate tribal jurisdiction would run\nwith the land, we see no reason why a nonmember would\nthink so either.\n   The Longs point out that the Bank in this case could\nhardly have been surprised by the Tribe\u2019s assertion of\nregulatory power over the parties\u2019 business dealings. The\nBank, after all, had \u201clengthy on-reservation commercial\nrelationships with the Long Company.\u201d Brief for Respon-\ndents 40. JUSTICE GINSBURG echoes this point. See post,\nat 4. But as we have emphasized repeatedly in this con-\ntext, when it comes to tribal regulatory authority, it is not\n\u201cin for a penny, in for a Pound.\u201d Atkinson, 532 U. S., at\n656 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Bank may\nreasonably have anticipated that its various commercial\ndealings with the Longs could trigger tribal authority to\nregulate those transactions\u2014a question we need not and\ndo not decide. But there is no reason the Bank should\n20   PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v.

The upshot was to require the Bank to offer the\nsame terms of sale to a prospective buyer who had de-\nfaulted in several previous transactions with the Bank as\nit offered to a different buyer without such a history of\ndefault. This is surely not a typical regulation. But what-\never the Bank anticipated, whatever \u201cconsensual relation-\nship\u201d may have been established through the Bank\u2019s\ndealing with the Longs, the jurisdictional consequences of\nthat relationship cannot extend to the Bank\u2019s subsequent\nsale of its fee land.\n   The Longs acknowledge, if obliquely, the critical impor-\ntance of land status. They emphasize that the Long Com-\npany \u201coperated on reservation fee and trust lands,\u201d Brief\nfor Respondents 40, and n. 24, 41, and note that \u201cthe fee\nland at issue in the lease-repurchase agreement\u201d had\npreviously belonged to a tribal member, id., at 47. These\nfacts, however, do not change the status of the land at the\ntime of the challenged sale. Regardless of where the Long\nCompany operated, the fee land whose sale the Longs seek\nto restrain was owned by the Bank at the relevant time.\nAnd indeed, before that, it was owned by Kenneth Long, a\nnon-Indian. See Hicks, supra, at 382, n. 4 (SOUTER, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cLand status . . . might well have an impact\nunder one (or perhaps both) of the Montana exceptions\u201d),\nAtkinson, supra, at 659 (SOUTER, J., concurring) (status of\nterritory as \u201ctribal or fee land may have much to do (as it\ndoes here) with the likelihood (or not) that facts will exist\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

Brief for Respondents 44. That argument is\nunavailing. The Longs are the first to point out that their\nbreach-of-contract and bad-faith claims, which do involve\nthe Bank\u2019s course of dealings, are not before this Court.\nIbid. Only the discrimination claim is before us and that\nclaim is tied specifically to the sale of the fee land.2 Ibid.\nCount six of the Longs\u2019 amended complaint in the Tribal\nCourt alleges that \u201c[i]n selling the Longs\u2019 land, [Plains\nCommerce Bank] unfairly discriminated against the Com-\npany and the Longs.\u201d App. 172\u2013173 (emphasis added). As\nrelief, the Longs claimed they \u201cshould get possession and\ntitle to their land back.\u201d Id., at 173. The Longs\u2019 discrimi-\nnation claim, in short, is an attempt to regulate the terms\non which the Bank may sell the land it owns.3\n   Such regulation is outside the scope of a tribe\u2019s sover-\neign authority.

Post, at 8. First, we\nhave not said the Tribal Court has jurisdiction over the other claims:\nThat question is not before us and we decline to speculate as to its\nanswer. Moreover, the claims on which the Longs prevailed concern\nbreach of a loan agreement, see App. 190, and bad faith in connection\nwith Bureau of Indian Affairs loan guarantees, see id., at 192. The\npresent claim involves substantive regulation of the sale of fee land.\n  3 We point to the relief requested by the Longs\u2014and partially granted\n\nby the Tribal Court\u2014to rebut the Longs\u2019 contention that their claim did\nnot focus on the sale of the fee land. Contrary to JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s\nassertion, however, the nature of this remedy does not drive our juris-\ndictional ruling. See post, at 11\u201312. The remedy is invalid because\nthere is no jurisdiction, not the other way around.\n22   PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v.

Post, at 8. This argument completely overlooks\nthe very reason cases like Montana and this one arise:\nTribal jurisdiction, unlike the jurisdiction of the other\ngovernmental entities cited by JUSTICE GINSBURG, gener-\nally does not extend to nonmembers. See Montana, supra,\nat 565. The sovereign authority of Indian tribes is limited\nin ways state and federal authority is not. Contrary to\nJUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s suggestion, that bedrock principle\ndoes not vary depending on the desirability of a particular\nregulation.\n  Montana provides that, in certain circumstances, tribes\nmay exercise authority over the conduct of nonmembers,\neven if that conduct takes place on non-Indian fee land.\nBut conduct taking place on the land and the sale of the\nland are two very different things. The Cheyenne River\nSioux Tribe lost the authority to restrain the sale of fee\nsimple parcels inside their borders when the land was sold\nas part of the 1908 Allotment Act. Nothing in Montana\ngives it back.\n                              C\n   Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals\nrelied for its decision on the second Montana exception.\nThe Eighth Circuit declined to address the exception\u2019s\napplicability, see 491 F. 3d, at 888, n. 7, while the District\nCourt strongly suggested in passing that the second excep-\ntion would not apply here, see 440 F. Supp. 2d, at 1077.\nThe District Court is correct, for the same reasons we\nexplained above. The second Montana exception stems\nfrom the same sovereign interests that give rise to the\nfirst, interests that do not reach to regulating the sale of\nnon-Indian fee land.\n   The second exception authorizes the tribe to exercise\ncivil jurisdiction when non-Indians\u2019 \u201cconduct\u201d menaces the\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

The\nconduct must do more than injure the tribe, it must \u201cim-\nperil the subsistence\u201d of the tribal community. Ibid. One\ncommentator has noted that \u201cth[e] elevated threshold for\napplication of the second Montana exception suggests that\ntribal power must be necessary to avert catastrophic\nconsequences.\u201d Cohen \u00a74.02[3][c], at 232, n. 220.\n   The sale of formerly Indian-owned fee land to a third\nparty is quite possibly disappointing to the tribe, but\ncannot fairly be called \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for tribal self-\ngovernment. See Strate, 520 U. S., at 459. The land in\nquestion here has been owned by a non-Indian party for at\nleast 50 years, Brief for Respondents 4, during which time\nthe project of tribal self-government has proceeded with-\nout interruption. The land\u2019s resale to another non-Indian\nhardly \u201cimperil[s] the subsistence or welfare of the tribe.\u201d\nMontana, supra, at 566. Accordingly, we hold the second\nMontana exception inapplicable in this case.\n                             D\n   Finally, we address the Longs\u2019 argument that the Bank\nconsented to tribal court jurisdiction over the discrimina-\ntion claim by seeking the assistance of tribal courts in\nserving a notice to quit. Brief for Respondents 44\u201346.\nWhen the Longs refused to vacate the land, the Bank\ninitiated eviction proceedings in South Dakota state court.\nThe Bank then asked the Tribal Court to appoint a process\nserver able to reach the Longs. Seeking the Tribal Court\u2019s\naid in serving process on tribal members for a pending\nstate-court action does not, we think, constitute consent to\nfuture litigation in the Tribal Court. Notably, when the\nLongs did file their complaint against the Bank in Tribal\nCourt, the Bank promptly contended in its answer that\nthe court lacked jurisdiction.

Further, I\ntake no issue with the Court\u2019s jurisdictional ruling insofar\nas it relates to the Tribal Court\u2019s supplemental judgment.\nIn that judgment, the Tribal Court ordered the Bank to\ngive Ronnie and Lila Long an option to repurchase fee\nland the Bank had already contracted to sell to non-Indian\nindividuals. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u201369 to A\u201371.\n   I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision, however, to the\nextent that it overturns the Tribal Court\u2019s principal judg-\nment awarding the Longs damages in the amount of\n$750,000 plus interest. See App. 194\u2013196. That judgment\ndid not disturb the Bank\u2019s sale of fee land to non-Indians.\nIt simply responded to the claim that the Bank, in its on-\nreservation commercial dealings with the Longs, treated\nthem disadvantageously because of their tribal affiliation\nand racial identity. A claim of that genre, I would hold, is\none the Tribal Court is competent to adjudicate. As the\n2    PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v.

United States, 450\nU. S. 544, 564\u2013565 (1981), this Court restated that, absent\na treaty or statute, Indian tribes generally lack authority\nto regulate the activities of nonmembers. While stating\nthe general rule, Montana also identified two exceptions:\n    \u201cA tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or\n    other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter\n    consensual relationships with the tribe or its mem-\n    bers, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or\n    other arrangements. A tribe may also retain inherent\n    power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of\n    non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when\n    that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the\n    political integrity, the economic security, or the health\n    or welfare of the tribe.\u201d Id., at 565\u2013566 (citations\n    omitted).\nThese two exceptions, Montana explained, recognize that\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

See id., at 557. This Court has since clari-\nfied that when a tribe has authority to regulate the activ-\nity of nonmembers, tribal courts presumably have\nadjudicatory authority over disputes arising out of that\nactivity. See Strate v. A\u20131 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438, 453\n(1997) (as to nonmembers, a tribe\u2019s adjudicative jurisdic-\ntion coincides with its legislative jurisdiction). In my view,\nthis is a clear case for application of Montana\u2019s first or\n\u201cconsensual relationships\u201d exception. I therefore do not\nreach the Longs\u2019 alternative argument that their com-\nplaint also fits within Montana\u2019s second exception.\n   Ronnie and Lila Long, husband and wife and owners of\nthe Long Family Land and Cattle Company (Long Com-\npany), are enrolled members of the Cheyenne River Sioux\nTribe. Although the Long Company was incorporated in\nSouth Dakota, the enterprise \u201cwas overwhelmingly tribal\nin character, as were its interactions with the bank.\u201d 491\nF. 3d, at 886. All Long Company property was situated\u2014\nand all operations of the enterprise occurred\u2014within the\nCheyenne River Sioux Indian Reservation. The Long\nCompany\u2019s articles of incorporation required Indian own-\nership of a majority of the corporation\u2019s shares. This\nrequirement reflected the Long Company\u2019s status as an\nIndian-owned business entity eligible for Bureau of Indian\nAffairs (BIA) loan guarantees. See 25 CFR \u00a7103.25 (2007)\n(requiring at least 51% Indian ownership). Loan guaran-\ntees are among the incentives the BIA offers to promote\nthe development of on-reservation Indian enterprises.

The business relationship dates from 1988, when\nRonnie Long\u2019s parents\u2014one of them a member of the\nTribe\u2014mortgaged some 2,230 acres of land to the Bank to\ngain working capital for the ranch. As security for the\nBank\u2019s loans over the years, the Longs mortgaged both\ntheir land and their personal property. The Bank bene-\nfited significantly from the Long Company\u2019s status as an\nIndian-owned business entity, for the BIA loan guarantees\n\u201callowed [it] to greatly reduce its lending risk.\u201d Ibid.\nEventually, the Bank collected from the BIA almost\n$400,000, more than 80% of the net losses resulting from\nits loans to the Longs.

Following the death of Ronnie\u2019s father, the\nBank and the Longs entered into an agreement under\nwhich the mortgaged land would be deeded over to the\nBank in exchange for the Bank\u2019s canceling some debt and\nmaking additional loans to keep the ranch in business.\nThe Longs were given a two-year lease on the property\nwith an option to buy the land back when the lease term\nexpired.

I\nam convinced that the courts below got it right.\n   This case, it bears emphasis, involves no unwitting\noutsider forced to litigate under unfamiliar rules and\nprocedures in tribal court. Cf. Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U. S.\n353, 382\u2013385 (2001) (SOUTER, J., concurring). Hardly a\nstranger to the tribal court system, the Bank regularly\nfiled suit in that forum. See Brief for Cheyenne River\nSioux Tribe as Amicus Curiae 29\u201331. The Bank enlisted\ntribal-court aid to serve notice to quit on the Longs in\nconnection with state-court eviction proceedings. The\nBank later filed a counterclaim for eviction and motion for\nsummary judgment in the case the Longs commenced in\nthe Tribal Court. In its summary judgment motion, the\nBank stated, without qualification, that the Tribal Court\n\u201cha[d] jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action.\u201d\nApp. 187\u2013188. Had the Bank wanted to avoid responding\nin tribal court or the application of tribal law, the means\nwere readily at hand: The Bank could have included forum\nselection, choice-of-law, or arbitration clauses in its\nagreements with the Longs, which the Bank drafted.

Presumably, the reference to \u201cleases\u201d\nincludes leases of fee land. But why should a nonmem-\nber\u2019s lease of fee land to a member be differentiated, for\nMontana exception purposes, from a sale of the same\nland? And why would the enforcement of an antidiscrimi-\nnation command be less important to tribal self-rule and\ndignity, cf. ante, at 16\u201318, when the command relates to\nland sales than when it relates to other commercial rela-\ntionships between nonmembers and members?\n                            III\n   As earlier observed, see supra, at 1, I agree that the\nTribal Court had no authority to grant the Longs an op-\ntion to purchase the 960-acre parcel the Bank had con-\ntracted to sell to individuals unaffiliated with the Tribe.\n                     Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                   7\n\n                        Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nThe third parties\u2019 contracts with the Bank cannot be\ndisturbed based on Montana\u2019s exception for \u201cthe activities\nof nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with\nthe tribe or its members.\u201d 450 U. S., at 565. Although the\nTribal Court overstepped in its supplemental judgment\nordering the Bank to give the Longs an option to purchase\nland third parties had contracted to buy, see App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. A\u201369 to A\u201371, it scarcely follows that the Tribal\nCourt lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the Longs\u2019 dis-\ncrimination claim, and to order in its principal judgment,\nsee App. 194\u2013196, monetary relief.1\n   The Court recognizes that \u201c[t]he Bank may reasonably\nhave anticipated that its various commercial dealings with\nthe Longs could trigger tribal authority to regulate those\ntransactions.\u201d Ante, at 19. Today\u2019s decision, furthermore,\npurports to leave the Longs\u2019 breach-of-contract and bad-\nfaith claims untouched. Ante, at 21, n. 2. Noting that the\nBank \u201cdoes not presently challenge the breach-of-contract\nverdict,\u201d ante, at 6, the Court emphasizes that \u201c[o]nly the\ndiscrimination claim is before us and that claim is tied\nspecifically to the sale of the fee land,\u201d ante, at 21. But if\nthe Tribal Court is a proper forum for the Longs\u2019 claim\nthat the Bank has broken its promise or acted deceptively\nin the land-financing transactions at issue, one is hard put\nto understand why the Tribe could not likewise enforce in\nits courts a law that commands: Thou shall not discrimi-\nnate against tribal members in the terms and conditions\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Longs joined their discrimination claim with claims of breach of\n\ncontract and bad-faith dealings. The jury found in favor of the Longs\non all three claims. App. 190\u2013192. The latter claims alleged that the\nBank \u201cnever provided the . . . operating loans\u201d promised during the\nparties\u2019 negotiations. 491 F. 3d 878, 882 (CA8 2007). \u201c[A]s a result,\u201d\nthe Longs asserted, \u201cthe company was not able [to] sustain its ranching\noperation through the particularly harsh winter of 1996\u201397.\u201d Ibid.\nNothing in the Court\u2019s opinion precludes decision of those claims by the\nTribal Court. See ante, at 6, 8, 21, n. 2.\n8    PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                     CATTLE CO.                                  \n\n                 Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nyou offer them in those same transactions. The Federal\nGovernment and every State, county, and municipality\ncan make nondiscrimination the law governing contracts\ngenerally, and real property transactions in particular.\nSee, e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71981, 1982. Why should the Tribe\nlack comparable authority to shield its members against\ndiscrimination by those engaging in on-reservation com-\nmercial relationships\u2014including land-secured lending\u2014\nwith them?\n                                A\n  The \u201cfighting issue\u201d in the tribal trial court, the Eighth\nCircuit underscored, \u201cwas whether the bank denied the\nLongs favorable terms on a deal solely on the basis of their\nrace or tribal affiliation.\u201d 491 F. 3d, at 891. The Longs\nmaintained that the Bank initially offered them more\nfavorable terms, proposing to sell the mortgaged land back\nto them with a 20-year contract for deed. Thereafter, the\nBank sent a letter to Ronnie Long withdrawing its initial\noffer, \u201cciting \u2018possible jurisdictional problems\u2019 posed by the\nLong Company\u2019s status as an \u2018Indian owned entity on the\nreservation.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 882 (quoting Letter from Charles\nSimon, Vice President, Bank of Hoven, to Ronnie Long\n(Apr. 26, 1996), App. 91). In the final agreement, the\nBank promised no long-term financing; instead, it gave the\nLongs only a two-year lease with an option to purchase\nthat required a large balloon payment within 60 days of\nthe lease\u2019s expiration. When the Longs were unable to\nmake the required payment within the specified deadline,\nthe Bank sold the land to nonmembers on more favorable\nterms.\n  In their complaint, the Longs alleged that the Bank\nallowed the non-Indians \u201cten years to pay for the land, but\nthe bank would not permit [the] Longs even 60 days to pay\nfor their land,\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch unfair discrimination by\nthe bank prevented the Longs and the [Long] Company\n                     Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                   9\n\n                        Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nfrom buying back their land from the bank.\u201d App. 173.\nAlthough the allegations about the Bank\u2019s contracts to sell\nto nonmembers were central to the Longs\u2019 lawsuit, those\ntransactions with third parties were not the wrong about\nwhich the Longs complained. Rather, as the tribal trial\ncourt observed, the contracts with nonmembers simply\nsupplied \u201cevidence that the Bank denied the Longs the\nprivilege of contracting for a deed because of their status\nas tribal members.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u201378 to A\u201379\n(emphasis added).\n   The Tribal Court instructed the jury to hold the Bank\nliable on the discrimination claim only if the less favorable\nterms given to the Longs rested \u201csolely\u201d upon the Longs\u2019\n\u201crace or tribal identity.\u201d 491 F. 3d, at 883 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). In response to a special interroga-\ntory, the jury found that \u201cthe Defendant Bank intention-\nally discriminate[d] against the Plaintiffs Ronnie and Lila\nLong [in the lease with option to purchase] based solely\nupon their status as Indians or tribal members.\u201d App.\n191. Neither the instruction nor the special finding neces-\nsitated regulation of, or interference with, the Bank\u2019s fee-\nland sales to non-Indian individuals. See ante, at 1.2\n   Tellingly, the Bank\u2019s principal jurisdictional argument\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The  Court criticizes the Tribal Court for \u201crequir[ing] the Bank to\noffer the same terms of sale to a prospective buyer who had defaulted in\nseveral previous transactions with the Bank as it offered to a different\nbuyer without such a history of default.\u201d Ante, at 20. That criticism is\nunfair. First, the record does not confirm that the Longs were riskier\nbuyers than the nonmembers to whom the Bank eventually sold the\nland. Overlooked by the Court, the Bank\u2019s loans to the Longs were\nsheltered by BIA loan guarantees. See supra, at 3\u20134. Further, a\ndetermination that the Longs had encountered intentional discrimina-\ntion based solely on their status as tribal members in no way inhibited\nthe Bank from differentiating evenhandedly among borrowers based on\ntheir creditworthiness. The proscription of discrimination simply\nrequired the Bank to offer the Longs the same terms it would have\noffered similarly situated non-Indians.\n10     PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND &\n                       CATTLE CO.                                          \n\n                   Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nbelow bore no relationship to the position the Court em-\nbraces. The Bank recognized that the Longs were indeed\ncomplaining about discriminatory conduct of a familiar\nsort. Cf. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409, 413\n(1968) (42 U. S. C. \u00a71982 \u201cbars all racial discrimination\n. . . in the sale or rental of property\u201d). In Hicks, 533 U. S.\n353, this Court held that tribal courts could not exercise\njurisdiction over a claim arising under federal law, in that\ncase, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Relying on Hicks, the Bank in-\nsisted that the Longs\u2019 discrimination claim could not be\nheard in tribal court because it arose under well-known\nfederal antidiscrimination law, specifically, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71981 or \u00a72000d. 491 F. 3d, at 882\u2013883. The Tribal Court\nof Appeals, however, held that the claim arose under\nLakota common law, which resembled federal and state\nantidiscrimination measures. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u2013\n54 to A\u201355, and n. 5.3\n                          B\n  The Longs requested a remedy the Tribal Court did not\nhave authority to grant\u2014namely, an option to repurchase\nland the Bank had already contracted to sell to nonmem-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The Court types the Longs\u2019 discrimination claim as \u201c \u2018novel,\u2019 \u201d ante,\n\nat 20 (quoting 491 F. 3d, at 892), because the Tribal Court of Appeals\nderived the applicable law \u201c \u2018directly from Lakota tradition,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 20\n(quoting </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1082 (SD 2007) (case below)). Concern-\ning the content of the Tribe\u2019s law, however, the appeals court drew not\nonly from \u201cTribal tradition and custom,\u201d it also looked to federal and\nstate law. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u201355. Just as state courts may\ndraw upon federal law when appropriate, see, e.g., Dawson v. Bi-\nrenbaum, 968 S. W. 2d 663, 666\u2013667 (Ky. 1998), and federal courts may\nlook to state law to fill gaps, see, e.g., United States v. Kimbell Foods,\nInc., 440 U. S. 715, 728\u2013730 (1979), so too may tribal courts \u201cborrow\nfrom the law of . . . the federal government,\u201d see F. Cohen, Handbook of\nFederal Indian Law \u00a74.05[1], p. 275 (2005 ed.). With regard to checks\nagainst discrimination, as the Tribal Court of Appeals observed, \u201cthere\nis a direct and laudable convergence of federal, state, and tribal con-\ncern.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u201355 to A\u201356.\n                    Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                  11\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nber third parties. See supra, at 6\u20137. That limitation,\nhowever, does not affect the court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the\nLongs\u2019 discrimination claim and to award damages on\nthat claim. \u201cThe nature of the relief available after juris-\ndiction attaches is, of course, different from the question\nwhether there is jurisdiction to adjudicate the contro-\nversy.\u201d Avco Corp. v. Machinists, 390 U. S. 557, 561\n(1968). See also Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S. 228, 239\u2013\n240, n. 18 (1979) (\u201c[J]urisdiction is a question of whether a\nfederal court has the power . . . to hear a case\u201d; \u201crelief is a\nquestion of the various remedies a federal court may make\navailable.\u201d).\n   Under the procedural rules applicable in Cheyenne\nRiver Sioux Tribal Courts, as under the Federal Rules,\ndemand for one form of relief does not confine a trial\ncourt\u2019s remedial authority. See Law and Order Code of\nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Rule Civ. Proc. 25(c)(1)\n(\u201c[E]very final judgment shall grant the relief to which the\nparty in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if such\nrelief is not demanded in the pleadings.\u201d); Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 54(c) (materially identical). A court does not lose\njurisdiction over a claim merely because it lacks authority\nto provide the form of relief a party primarily demands.\nSee Avco, 390 U. S., at 560\u2013561; 10 C. Wright, A. Miller, &\nM. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72664, pp. 181\u2013\n182 (3d ed. 1998) (\u201c[I]t is not . . . the type of relief re-\nquested in the demand that determines whether the court\nhas jurisdiction.\u201d).4 In such a case, authority to provide\nanother remedy suffices to permit the court to adjudicate\nthe merits of the claim. See Avco, 390 U. S., at 560\u2013561.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 As  in this case, see App. 177\u2013179, the complaint in Avco sought\ninjunctive relief, but also included a residual clause asking for other\nrelief, see Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, Int\u2019l Assn. of Mach. and\nAerospace Workers, 376 F. 2d 337, 339 (CA6 1967).\n12   PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v.
