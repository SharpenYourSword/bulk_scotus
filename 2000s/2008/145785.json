GILLESPIE COUNTY, TEXAS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 07–440.      Argued March 17, 2008—Decided June 23, 2008\nTexas police relied on erroneous information that petitioner Rothgery\n  had a previous felony conviction to arrest him as a felon in possession\n  of a firearm. The officers brought Rothgery before a magistrate\n  judge, as required by state law, for a so-called “article 15.17 hearing,”\n  at which the Fourth Amendment probable-cause determination was\n  made, bail was set, and Rothgery was formally apprised of the accu-\n  sation against him. After the hearing, the magistrate judge commit-\n  ted Rothgery to jail, and he was released after posting a surety bond.\n  Rothgery had no money for a lawyer and made several unheeded oral\n  and written requests for appointed counsel. He was subsequently in-\n  dicted and rearrested, his bail was increased, and he was jailed when\n  he could not post the bail. Subsequently, Rothgery was assigned a\n  lawyer, who assembled the paperwork that prompted the indict-\n  ment’s dismissal.\n     Rothgery then brought this 42 U. S. C. §1983 action against re-\n  spondent County, claiming that if it had provided him a lawyer\n  within a reasonable time after the article 15.17 hearing, he would not\n  have been indicted, rearrested, or jailed. He asserts that the\n  County’s unwritten policy of denying appointed counsel to indigent\n  defendants out on bond until an indictment is entered violates his\n  Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The District Court granted the\n  County summary judgment, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, consider-\n  ing itself bound by Circuit precedent to the effect that the right to\n  counsel did not attach at the article 15.17 hearing because the rele-\n  vant prosecutors were not aware of, or involved in, Rothgery’s arrest\n  or appearance at the hearing, and there was no indication that the of-\n  ficer at Rothgery’s appearance had any power to commit the State to\n  prosecute without a prosecutor’s knowledge or involvement.\n2                ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: A criminal defendant’s initial appearance before a magistrate\n judge, where he learns the charge against him and his liberty is sub-\n ject to restriction, marks the initiation of adversary judicial proceed-\n ings that trigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to coun-\n sel. Attachment does not also require that a prosecutor (as distinct\n from a police officer) be aware of that initial proceeding or involved in\n its conduct. Pp. 5–20.\n    (a) Texas’s article 15.17 hearing marks the point of attachment,\n with the consequent state obligation to appoint counsel within a rea-\n sonable time once a request for assistance is made. This Court has\n twice held that the right to counsel attaches at the initial appearance\n before a judicial officer at which a defendant is told of the formal ac-\n cusation against him and restrictions are imposed on his liberty. See\n Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, 629, n. 3; Brewer v. Williams,\n 430 U. S. 387, 398–399. Rothgery’s hearing was an initial appear-\n ance: he was taken before a magistrate judge, informed of the formal\n accusation against him, and sent to jail until he posted bail. Thus,\n Brewer and Jackson control. Pp. 5–10.\n    (b) In McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 180–181, the Court reaf-\n firmed that “[t]he Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at the\n first formal proceeding against an accused,” and observed that “in\n most States . . . free counsel is made available at that time.” That\n observation remains true today. The overwhelming consensus prac-\n tice conforms to the rule that the first formal proceeding is the point\n of attachment. The Court is advised without contradiction that not\n only the Federal Government, including the District of Columbia, but\n 43 States take the first step toward appointing counsel before, at, or\n just after initial appearance. To the extent the remaining 7 States\n have been denying appointed counsel at that time, they are a distinct\n minority. Pp. 10–12.\n    (c) Neither the Fifth Circuit nor the County offers an acceptable\n justification for the minority practice. Pp. 12–19.\n       (1) The Fifth Circuit found the determining factor to be that no\n prosecutor was aware of Rothgery’s article 15.17 hearing or involved\n in it. This prosecutorial awareness standard is wrong. Neither\n Brewer nor Jackson said a word about the prosecutor’s involvement\n as a relevant fact, much less a controlling one. Those cases left no\n room for the factual enquiry the Circuit would require, and with good\n reason: an attachment rule that turned on determining the moment\n of a prosecutor’s first involvement would be “wholly unworkable and\n impossible to administer,” Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 496.\n The Fifth Circuit derived its rule from the statement, in Kirby v. Illi-\n nois, 406 U. S. 682, 689, that the right to counsel attaches when the\n government has “committed itself to prosecute.” But what counts as\n                      Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                     3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  such a commitment is an issue of federal law unaffected by alloca-\n  tions of power among state officials under state law, cf. Moran v.\n  Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 429, n. 3, and under the federal standard, an\n  accusation filed with a judicial officer is sufficiently formal, and the\n  government’s commitment to prosecute it sufficiently concrete, when\n  the accusation prompts arraignment and restrictions on the accused’s\n  liberty, see, e.g., Kirby, supra, at 689. Pp. 12–15.\n       (2) The County relies on United States v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180,\n  in arguing that in considering the initial appearance’s significance,\n  this Court must ignore prejudice to a defendant’s pretrial liberty, it\n  being the concern, not of the right to counsel, but of the speedy-trial\n  right and the Fourth Amendment. But the County’s suggestion that\n  Fifth Amendment protections at the early stage obviate attachment\n  of the Sixth Amendment right at initial appearance was refuted by\n  Jackson, 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3. And since the Court is not asked to\n  extend the right to counsel to a point earlier than formal judicial pro-\n  ceedings (as in Gouveia), but to defer it to those proceedings in which\n  a prosecutor is involved, Gouveia does not speak to the question at is-\n  sue. Pp. 15–17.\n       (3) The County’s third tack gets it no further. Stipulating that\n  the properly formulated test is whether the State has objectively\n  committed itself to prosecute, the County says that prosecutorial in-\n  volvement is but one form of evidence of such commitment and that\n  others include (1) the filing of formal charges or the holding of an ad-\n  versarial preliminary hearing to determine probable cause to file\n  such charges, and (2) a court appearance following arrest on an in-\n  dictment. Either version runs up against Brewer and Jackson: an\n  initial appearance following a charge signifies a sufficient commit-\n  ment to prosecute regardless of a prosecutor’s participation, indict-\n  ment, information, or what the County calls a “formal” complaint.\n  The County’s assertions that Brewer and Jackson are “vague” and\n  thus of limited, if any, precedential value are wrong. Although the\n  Court in those cases saw no need for lengthy disquisitions on the ini-\n  tial appearance’s significance, that was because it found the attach-\n  ment issue an easy one. See, e.g., Brewer, supra, at 399. Pp. 17–19.\n491 F. 3d 293, vacated and remanded.\n\n   SOUTER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

ROTHGERY, PETITIONER v. GILLESPIE\n               COUNTY, TEXAS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                                  [June 23, 2008]\n\n  JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This Court has held that the right to counsel guaranteed\nby the Sixth Amendment applies at the first appearance\nbefore a judicial officer at which a defendant is told of the\nformal accusation against him and restrictions are im-\nposed on his liberty. See Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S.\n387, 398–399 (1977); Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625,\n629, n. 3 (1986). The question here is whether attachment\nof the right also requires that a public prosecutor (as\ndistinct from a police officer) be aware of that initial pro-\nceeding or involved in its conduct. We hold that it does\nnot.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  Although petitioner Walter Rothgery has never been\nconvicted of a felony,1 a criminal background check dis-\nclosed an erroneous record that he had been, and on July\n——————\n   1 “[F]elony charges . . . had been dismissed after Rothgery completed\n\na diversionary program, and both sides agree that [he] did not have a\nfelony conviction.” 491 F. 3d 293, 294 (CA5 2007) (case below).\n2                ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n15, 2002, Texas police officers relied on this record to\narrest him as a felon in possession of a firearm. The offi-\ncers lacked a warrant, and so promptly brought Rothgery\nbefore a magistrate judge, as required by Tex. Crim. Proc.\nCode Ann., Art. 14.06(a) (West Supp. 2007).2 Texas law\nhas no formal label for this initial appearance before a\nmagistrate, see 41 G. Dix & R. Dawson, Texas Practice\nSeries: Criminal Practice and Procedure §15.01 (2d ed.\n2001), which is sometimes called the “article 15.17 hear-\ning,” see, e.g., Kirk v. State, 199 S. W. 3d 467, 476–477\n(Tex. App. 2006); it combines the Fourth Amendment’s\nrequired probable-cause determination3 with the setting of\nbail, and is the point at which the arrestee is formally\napprised of the accusation against him, see Tex. Crim.\nProc. Code Ann., Art. 15.17(a).\n   Rothgery’s article 15.17 hearing followed routine. The\narresting officer submitted a sworn “Affidavit Of Probable\nCause” that described the facts supporting the arrest and\n“charge[d] that . . . Rothgery . . . commit[ted] the offense of\nunlawful possession of a firearm by a felon—3rd degree\nfelony [Tex. Penal Code Ann. §46.04],” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 33a. After reviewing the affidavit, the magistrate\njudge “determined that probable cause existed for the\n——————\n    2Aseparate article of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure requires\nprompt presentment in the case of arrests under warrant as well. See\nArt. 15.17(a) (West Supp. 2007). Whether the arrest is under warrant\nor warrantless, article 15.17 details the procedures a magistrate judge\nmust follow upon presentment. See Art. 14.06(a) (in cases of war-\nrantless arrest, “[t]he magistrate shall immediately perform the duties\ndescribed in Article 15.17 of this Code”).\n  3 See Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 113–114 (1975) (“[A] police-\n\nman’s on-the-scene assessment of probable cause provides legal justifi-\ncation for arresting a person suspected of crime, and for a brief period\nof detention to take the administrative steps incident to arrest[,] . . . .\n[but] the Fourth Amendment requires a judicial determination of\nprobable cause as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty follow-\ning arrest”).\n                     Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\narrest.” Id., at 34a. The magistrate judge informed Roth-\ngery of the accusation, set his bail at $5,000, and commit-\nted him to jail, from which he was released after posting a\nsurety bond. The bond, which the Gillespie County deputy\nsheriff signed, stated that “Rothgery stands charged by\ncomplaint duly filed . . . with the offense of a . . . felony, to\nwit: Unlawful Possession of a Firearm by a Felon.” Id., at\n39a. The release was conditioned on the defendant’s\npersonal appearance in trial court “for any and all subse-\nquent proceedings that may be had relative to the said\ncharge in the course of the criminal action based on said\ncharge.” Ibid.\n  Rothgery had no money for a lawyer and made several\noral and written requests for appointed counsel,4 which\nwent unheeded.5 The following January, he was indicted\nby a Texas grand jury for unlawful possession of a firearm\nby a felon, resulting in rearrest the next day, and an order\nincreasing bail to $15,000. When he could not post it, he\nwas put in jail and remained there for three weeks.\n  On January 23, 2003, six months after the article 15.17\nhearing, Rothgery was finally assigned a lawyer, who\npromptly obtained a bail reduction (so Rothgery could get\nout of jail), and assembled the paperwork confirming that\nRothgery had never been convicted of a felony. Counsel\nrelayed this information to the district attorney, who in\nturn filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, which was\ngranted.\n\n——————\n  4 Because respondent Gillespie County obtained summary judgment\n\nin the current case, we accept as true that Rothgery made multiple\nrequests.\n  5 Rothgery also requested counsel at the article 15.17 hearing itself,\n\nbut the magistrate judge informed him that the appointment of counsel\nwould delay setting bail (and hence his release from jail). Given the\nchoice of proceeding without counsel or remaining in custody, Rothgery\nwaived the right to have appointed counsel present at the hearing. See\n491 F. 3d, at 295, n. 2.\n4                ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n   Rothgery then brought this 42 U. S. C. §1983 action\nagainst respondent Gillespie County, claiming that if the\nCounty had provided a lawyer within a reasonable time\nafter the article 15.17 hearing, he would not have been\nindicted, rearrested, or jailed for three weeks.         The\nCounty’s failure is said to be owing to its unwritten policy\nof denying appointed counsel to indigent defendants out\non bond until at least the entry of an information or in-\ndictment.6 Rothgery sees this policy as violating his Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel.7\n   The District Court granted summary judgment to the\nCounty, see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2511642\"><a href=\"/opinion/2511642/rothgery-v-gillespie-county-tex/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Court of Appeals felt itself bound by Circuit\nprecedent, see id., at 296–297 (citing Lomax v. Alabama,\n629 F. 2d 413 (CA5 1980), and McGee v. Estelle, 625 F. 2d\n1206 (CA5 1980)), to the effect that the Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel did not attach at the article 15.17 hearing,\nbecause “the relevant prosecutors were not aware of or\ninvolved in Rothgery’s arrest or appearance before the\nmagistrate on July 16, 2002,” and “[t]here is also no indi-\ncation that the officer who filed the probable cause affida-\nvit at Rothgery’s appearance had any power to commit the\nstate to prosecute without the knowledge or involvement\nof a prosecutor,” 491 F. 3d, at 297.\n——————\n    6 Rothgerydoes not challenge the County’s written policy for ap-\npointment of counsel, but argues that the County was not following\nthat policy in practice. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2511642\"><a href=\"/opinion/2511642/rothgery-v-gillespie-county-tex/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 809–810 (WD Tex.\n2006).\n  7 Such a policy, if proven, arguably would also be in violation of Texas\n\nstate law, which appears to require appointment of counsel for indigent\ndefendants released from custody, at the latest, when the “first court\nappearance” is made. See Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann., Art. 1.051(j).\nSee also Brief for Texas Association of Counties et al. as Amici Curiae\n13 (asserting that Rothgery “was statutorily entitled to the appoint-\nment of counsel within three days after having requested it”).\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

S. ___ (2007), and now\nvacate and remand.\n                              II\n   The Sixth Amendment right of the “accused” to assis-\ntance of counsel in “all criminal prosecutions”8 is limited\nby its terms: “it does not attach until a prosecution is\ncommenced.” McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 175\n(1991); see also Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 430\n(1986). We have, for purposes of the right to counsel,\npegged commencement to “ ‘the initiation of adversary\njudicial criminal proceedings—whether by way of formal\ncharge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or\narraignment,’ ” United States v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180,\n188 (1984) (quoting Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, 689\n(1972) (plurality opinion)). The rule is not “mere formal-\nism,” but a recognition of the point at which “the govern-\nment has committed itself to prosecute,” “the adverse\npositions of government and defendant have solidified,”\nand the accused “finds himself faced with the prosecutorial\nforces of organized society, and immersed in the intricacies\nof substantive and procedural criminal law.” Kirby, supra,\nat 689. The issue is whether Texas’s article 15.17 hearing\nmarks that point, with the consequent state obligation to\nappoint counsel within a reasonable time once a request\nfor assistance is made.\n                               A\n  When the Court of Appeals said no, because no prosecu-\ntor was aware of Rothgery’s article 15.17 hearing or in-\nvolved in it, the court effectively focused not on the start of\nadversarial judicial proceedings, but on the activities and\nknowledge of a particular state official who was presuma-\n——————\n  8 The Sixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions,\n\nthe accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel\nfor his defence.”\n6                ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbly otherwise occupied. This was error.\n  As the Court of Appeals recognized, see 491 F. 3d, at\n298, we have twice held that the right to counsel attaches\nat the initial appearance before a judicial officer, see\nJackson, 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3; Brewer 430 U. S., at 399.\nThis first time before a court, also known as the “ ‘prelimi-\nnary arraignment’ ” or “ ‘arraignment on the complaint,’ ”\nsee 1 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal\nProcedure §1.4(g), p. 135 (3d ed. 2007), is generally the\nhearing at which “the magistrate informs the defendant of\nthe charge in the complaint, and of various rights in fur-\nther proceedings,” and “determine[s] the conditions for\npretrial release,” ibid. Texas’s article 15.17 hearing is an\ninitial appearance: Rothgery was taken before a magis-\ntrate judge, informed of the formal accusation against\nhim, and sent to jail until he posted bail. See supra, at 2–\n3.9 Brewer and Jackson control.\n  The Brewer defendant surrendered to the police after a\nwarrant was out for his arrest on a charge of abduction.\n——————\n  9 The Court of Appeals did not resolve whether the arresting officer’s\n\nformal accusation would count as a “formal complaint” under Texas\nstate law. See 491 F. 3d, at 298–300 (noting the confusion in the Texas\nstate courts). But it rightly acknowledged (albeit in considering the\nseparate question whether the complaint was a “formal charge”) that\nthe constitutional significance of judicial proceedings cannot be allowed\nto founder on the vagaries of state criminal law, lest the attachment\nrule be rendered utterly “vague and unpredictable.” Virginia v. Moore,\n553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 10). See 491 F. 3d, at 300 (“[W]e\nare reluctant to rely on the formalistic question of whether the affidavit\nhere would be considered a ‘complaint’ or its functional equivalent\nunder Texas case law and Article 15.04 of the Texas Code of Criminal\nProcedures—a question to which the answer is itself uncertain. In-\nstead, we must look to the specific circumstances of this case and the\nnature of the affidavit filed at Rothgery’s appearance before the magis-\ntrate” (footnote omitted)). What counts is that the complaint filed with\nthe magistrate judge accused Rothgery of committing a particular\ncrime and prompted the judicial officer to take legal action in response\n(here, to set the terms of bail and order the defendant locked up).\n                      Cite as: 554 U.

Arizona, 384 U. S.\n436 (1966)] rights and committed him to jail.” Brewer, 430\nU. S., at 391. After this preliminary arraignment, and\nbefore an indictment on the abduction charge had been\nhanded up, police elicited incriminating admissions that\nultimately led to an indictment for first-degree murder.\nBecause neither of the defendant’s lawyers had been\npresent when the statements were obtained, the Court\nfound it “clear” that the defendant “was deprived of . . . the\nright to the assistance of counsel.” Id., at 397–398. In\nplain terms, the Court said that “[t]here can be no doubt\nin the present case that judicial proceedings had been\ninitiated” before the defendant made the incriminating\nstatements. Id., at 399. Although it noted that the State\nhad conceded the issue, the Court nevertheless held that\nthe defendant’s right had clearly attached for the reason\nthat “[a] warrant had been issued for his arrest, he had\nbeen arraigned on that warrant before a judge in a . . .\ncourtroom, and he had been committed by the court to\nconfinement in jail.” Ibid.10\n——————\n  10 The dissent says that “Brewer’s attachment holding is indisputably\n\nno longer good law” because “we have subsequently held that the Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel is ‘ “offense specific,” ’ ” post, at 13 (opinion\nof THOMAS, J.) (quoting Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162, 164 (2001)), i.e.,\nthat it does not “exten[d] to crimes that are ‘factually related’ to those\nthat have actually been charged,” Cobb, supra, at 167. It is true that\nBrewer appears to have assumed that attachment of the right with\nrespect to the abduction charge should prompt attachment for the\nmurder charge as well. But the accuracy of the dissent’s assertion ends\nthere, for nothing in Cobb’s conclusion that the right is offense specific\ncasts doubt on Brewer’s separate, emphatic holding that the initial\nappearance marks the point at which the right attaches. Nor does\nCobb reflect, as the dissent suggests, see post, at 14, a more general\ndisapproval of our opinion in Brewer. While Brewer failed even to\nacknowledge the issue of offense specificity, it spoke clearly and force-\nfully about attachment. Cobb merely declined to follow Brewer’s\n8                 ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   In Jackson, the Court was asked to revisit the question\nwhether the right to counsel attaches at the initial ap-\npearance, and we had no more trouble answering it the\nsecond time around. Jackson was actually two consoli-\ndated cases, and although the State conceded that respon-\ndent Jackson’s arraignment “represented the initiation of\nformal legal proceedings,” 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3, it argued\nthat the same was not true for respondent Bladel. In\nbriefing us, the State explained that “[i]n Michigan, any\nperson charged with a felony, after arrest, must be\nbrought before a Magistrate or District Court Judge with-\nout unnecessary delay for his initial arraignment.” Brief\nfor Petitioner in Michigan v. Bladel, O. T. 1985, No. 84–\n1539, p. 24. The State noted that “[w]hile [Bladel] had\nbeen arraigned . . . , there is also a second arraignment in\nMichigan procedure . . . , at which time defendant has his\nfirst opportunity to enter a plea in a court with jurisdic-\ntion to render a final decision in a felony case.” Id., at 25.\nThe State contended that only the latter proceeding, the\n“arraignment on the information or indictment,” Y.\nKamisar, W. LaFave, J. Israel, & N. King, Modern Crimi-\nnal Procedure 28 (9th ed. 1999) (emphasis deleted), should\ntrigger the Sixth Amendment right.11 “The defendant’s\n——————\nunmentioned assumption, and thus it lends no support to the dissent’s\nclaim that we should ignore what Brewer explicitly said.\n  11 The State continued to press this contention at oral argument. See\n\nTr. of Oral Arg. in Michigan v. Jackson, O. T. 1985, No. 84–1531 etc., p.\n4 (“[T]he Michigan Supreme Court held that if a defendant, while at his\ninitial appearance before a magistrate who has no jurisdiction to accept\na final plea in the case, whose only job is ministerial, in other words to\nadvise a defendant of the charge against him, set bond if bond is\nappropriate, and to advise him of his right to counsel and to get the\nadministrative process going if he’s indigent, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt said if the defendant asked for appointed counsel at that stage,\nthe police are forevermore precluded from initiating interrogation of\nthat defendant”); id., at 8 (“First of all, as a practical matter, at least in\nour courts, the police are rarely present for arraignment, for this type of\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

The conclusion was driven by\nthe same considerations the Court had endorsed in\nBrewer: by the time a defendant is brought before a judi-\ncial officer, is informed of a formally lodged accusation,\nand has restrictions imposed on his liberty in aid of the\nprosecution, the State’s relationship with the defendant\nhas become solidly adversarial. And that is just as true\nwhen the proceeding comes before the indictment (in the\ncase of the initial arraignment on a formal complaint) as\nwhen it comes after it (at an arraignment on an indict-\nment).13 See Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1, 8 (1970)\n——————\nan arraignment, for an initial appearance, I guess we should use the\nterminology. . . . The prosecutor is not there for initial appearance. We\nhave people brought through a tunnel. A court officer picks them up.\nThey take them down and the judge goes through this procedure. . . .\nThere is typically nobody from our side, if you will, there to see what’s\ngoing on”).\n  12 The preliminary examination is a preindictment stage at which the\n\ndefendant is allowed to test the prosecution’s evidence against him, and\nto try to dissuade the prosecutor from seeking an indictment. See\nColeman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1 (1970). In Texas, the defendant is\nnotified of his right to a preliminary hearing, which in Texas is called\nan “examining trial,” at the article 15.17 hearing. See Tex. Crim. Proc.\nCode Ann., Art. 15.17(a). The examining trial in Texas is optional only,\nand the defendant must affirmatively request it. See Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 25.\n  13 The County, in its brief to this Court, suggests that although\n\nBrewer and Jackson spoke of attachment at the initial appearance, the\ncases might actually have turned on some unmentioned fact.

See id., at 173; see also id., at 175 (“It\nis undisputed, and we accept for purposes of the present\ncase, that at the time petitioner provided the incriminat-\ning statements at issue, his Sixth Amendment right had\nattached . . .”).

See Brief for Respon-\ndent 34–36. But as Rothgery points out, the initial appearance in\nBrewer was made in municipal court, and a felony information could\nnot have been filed there. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 11. As to\nJackson, the County suggests that the Court might have viewed Michi-\ngan’s initial arraignment as a significant proceeding only because the\ndefendant could make a statement at that hearing, and because re-\nspondent Bladel did in fact purport to enter a plea of not guilty. See\nBrief for Respondent 36–37. But this attempt to explain Jackson as a\nnarrow holding is impossible to square with Jackson’s sweeping rejec-\ntion of the State’s claims. It is further undermined by the fact that the\nmagistrate judge in Bladel’s case, like the one in Texas’s article 15.17\nhearing, had no jurisdiction to accept a plea of guilty to a felony charge.\nSee Reply Brief for Petitioner 11–12.\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

Under this\nstandard of prosecutorial awareness, attachment depends\nnot on whether a first appearance has begun adversary\njudicial proceedings, but on whether the prosecutor had a\nhand in starting it. That standard is wrong.\n  Neither Brewer nor Jackson said a word about the\nprosecutor’s involvement as a relevant fact, much less a\ncontrolling one. Those cases left no room for the factual\nenquiry the Court of Appeals would require, and with good\nreason: an attachment rule that turned on determining\nthe moment of a prosecutor’s first involvement would be\n“wholly unworkable and impossible to administer,” Esco-\nbedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 496 (1964) (White, J., dis-\nsenting), guaranteed to bog the courts down in prying\nenquiries into the communication between police (who are\nroutinely present at defendants’ first appearances) and the\nState’s attorneys (who are not), see Brief for Petitioner 39–\n41. And it would have the practical effect of resting at-\ntachment on such absurd distinctions as the day of the\nmonth an arrest is made, see Brief for Brennan Center of\nJustice et al. as Amici Curiae 10 (explaining that “jails\nmay be required to report their arrestees to county prose-\ncutor offices on particular days” (citing Tex.

Prosecutors in these\njurisdictions use the systems to prescreen cases early in\nthe process before an initial appearance” (citing D. Carmi-\nchael, M. Gilbert, & M. Voloudakis, Texas A&M U., Public\nPolicy Research Inst., Evaluating the Impact of Direct\nElectronic Filing in Criminal Cases: Closing the Paper\nTrap 2–3 (2006), online at http://www.courts.state.tx.\nus/tfid/pdf/FinalReport7-12-06wackn.pdf (as visited June\n19, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file))).\n   It is not that the Court of Appeals believed that any\nsuch regime would be desirable, but it thought originally\nthat its rule was implied by this Court’s statement that\nthe right attaches when the government has “committed\nitself to prosecute.” Kirby, 406 U. S., at 689. The Court of\nAppeals reasoned that because “the decision not to prose-\ncute is the quintessential function of a prosecutor” under\nTexas law, 491 F. 3d, at 297 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), the State could not commit itself to prosecution\nuntil the prosecutor signaled that it had.\n   But what counts as a commitment to prosecute is an\nissue of federal law unaffected by allocations of power\namong state officials under a State’s law, cf. Moran, 475\nU. S., at 429, n. 3 (“[T]he type of circumstances that would\ngive rise to the right would certainly have a federal defini-\ntion”), and under the federal standard, an accusation filed\nwith a judicial officer is sufficiently formal, and the gov-\nernment’s commitment to prosecute it sufficiently con-\ncrete, when the accusation prompts arraignment and\nrestrictions on the accused’s liberty to facilitate the prose-\ncution, see Jackson, 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3; Brewer, 430\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 399; Kirby, supra, at 689; see also n. 9, supra.\nFrom that point on, the defendant is “faced with the\nprosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in\nthe intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law”\nthat define his capacity and control his actual ability to\ndefend himself against a formal accusation that he is a\ncriminal. Kirby, supra, at 689. By that point, it is too late\nto wonder whether he is “accused” within the meaning of\nthe Sixth Amendment, and it makes no practical sense to\ndeny it. See Grano, Rhode Island v. Innis: A Need to\nReconsider the Constitutional Premises Underlying the\nLaw of Confessions, 17 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1, 31 (1979)\n(“[I]t would defy common sense to say that a criminal\nprosecution has not commenced against a defendant who,\nperhaps incarcerated and unable to afford judicially im-\nposed bail, awaits preliminary examination on the author-\nity of a charging document filed by the prosecutor, less\ntypically by the police, and approved by a court of law”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). All of this is equally\ntrue whether the machinery of prosecution was turned on\nby the local police or the state attorney general. In this\ncase, for example, Rothgery alleges that after the initial\nappearance, he was “unable to find any employment for\nwages” because “all of the potential employers he con-\ntacted knew or learned of the criminal charge pending\nagainst him.” Original Complaint in No. 1:04–CV–00456–\nLY (WD Tex., July 15, 2004), p. 5. One may assume that\nthose potential employers would still have declined to\nmake job offers if advised that the county prosecutor had\nnot filed the complaint.\n                              2\n  The County resists this logic with the argument that in\nconsidering the significance of the initial appearance, we\nmust ignore prejudice to a defendant’s pretrial liberty,\nreasoning that it is the concern, not of the right to counsel,\n16            ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut of the speedy-trial right and the Fourth Amendment.\nSee Brief for Respondent 47–51. And it cites Gouveia, 467\nU. S. 180, in support of its contention. See Brief for Re-\nspondent 49; see also Brief for Texas et al. as Amici Curiae\n8–9. We think the County’s reliance on Gouveia is mis-\nplaced, and its argument mistaken.\n   The defendants in Gouveia were prison inmates, sus-\npected of murder, who had been placed in an administra-\ntive detention unit and denied counsel up until an indict-\nment was filed. Although no formal judicial proceedings\nhad taken place prior to the indictment, see 467 U. S., at\n185, the defendants argued that their administrative\ndetention should be treated as an accusation for purposes\nof the right to counsel because the government was ac-\ntively investigating the crimes. We recognized that “be-\ncause an inmate suspected of a crime is already in prison,\nthe prosecution may have little incentive promptly to\nbring formal charges against him, and that the resulting\npreindictment delay may be particularly prejudicial to the\ninmate,” id., at 192, but we noted that statutes of limita-\ntion and protections of the Fifth Amendment guarded\nagainst delay, and that there was no basis for “depart[ing]\nfrom our traditional interpretation of the Sixth Amend-\nment right to counsel in order to provide additional protec-\ntions for [the inmates],” ibid.\n   Gouveia’s holding that the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel had not attached has no application here. For one\nthing, Gouveia does not affect the conclusion we reaf-\nfirmed two years later in Jackson, that bringing a defen-\ndant before a court for initial appearance signals a suffi-\ncient commitment to prosecute and marks the start of\nadversary judicial proceedings. (Indeed, Jackson refutes\nthe County’s argument that Fifth Amendment protections\nat the early stage obviate attachment of the Sixth Amend-\nment right at initial appearance. See supra, at 8–9.) And\nsince we are not asked to extend the right to counsel to a\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npoint earlier than formal judicial proceedings (as in Gou-\nveia), but to defer it to those proceedings in which a prose-\ncutor is involved, Gouveia does not speak to the question\nbefore us.\n  The County also tries to downplay the significance of the\ninitial appearance by saying that an attachment rule\nunqualified by prosecutorial involvement would lead to the\nconclusion “that the State has statutorily committed to\nprosecute every suspect arrested by the police,” given that\n“state law requires [an article 15.17 hearing] for every\narrestee.” Brief for Respondent 24 (emphasis in original).\nThe answer, though, is that the State has done just that,\nsubject to the option to change its official mind later. The\nState may rethink its commitment at any point: it may\nchoose not to seek indictment in a felony case, say, or the\nprosecutor may enter nolle prosequi after the case gets to\nthe jury room. But without a change of position, a defen-\ndant subject to accusation after initial appearance is\nheaded for trial and needs to get a lawyer working,\nwhether to attempt to avoid that trial or to be ready with\na defense when the trial date arrives.\n                              3\n    A third tack on the County’s part, slightly different from\nthe one taken by the Fifth Circuit, gets it no further. The\nCounty stipulates that “the properly formulated test is not\n. . . merely whether prosecutors have had any involvement\nin the case whatsoever, but instead whether the State has\nobjectively committed itself to prosecute.” Id., at 31. It\nthen informs us that “[p]rosecutorial involvement is\nmerely one form of evidence of such commitment.” Ibid.\nOther sufficient evidentiary indications are variously\ndescribed: first (expansively) as “the filing of formal\ncharges . . . by information, indictment or formal com-\nplaint, or the holding of an adversarial preliminary hear-\ning to determine probable cause to file such charges,” ibid.\n18            ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(citing Kirby, 406 U. S., at 689); then (restrictively) as a\ncourt appearance following “arrest . . . on an indictment or\ninformation,” Brief for Respondent 32. Either version, in\nany event, runs up against Brewer and Jackson: an initial\nappearance following a charge signifies a sufficient com-\nmitment to prosecute regardless of a prosecutor’s partici-\npation, indictment, information, or what the County calls\na “formal” complaint.\n   So the County is reduced to taking aim at those cases.\nBrewer and Jackson, we are told, are “vague” and thus of\n“limited, if any, precedential value.” Brief for Respondent\n33, 35; see also id., at 32, n. 13 (asserting that Brewer and\nJackson “neither provide nor apply an analytical frame-\nwork for determining attachment”). And, according to the\nCounty, our cases (Brewer and Jackson aside) actually\nestablish a “general rule that the right to counsel attaches\nat the point that [what the County calls] formal charges\nare filed,” Brief for Respondent 19, with exceptions al-\nlowed only in the case of “a very limited set of specific\npreindictment situations,” id., at 23. The County suggests\nthat the latter category should be limited to those appear-\nances at which the aid of counsel is urgent and “ ‘the dan-\ngers to the accused of proceeding without counsel’ ” are\ngreat. Id., at 28 (quoting Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S.\n285, 298 (1988)). Texas’s article 15.17 hearing should not\ncount as one of those situations, the County says, because\nit is not of critical significance, since it “allows no presen-\ntation of witness testimony and provides no opportunity to\nexpose weaknesses in the government’s evidence, create a\nbasis for later impeachment, or even engage in basic dis-\ncovery.” Brief for Respondent 29.\n   We think the County is wrong both about the clarity of\nour cases and the substance that we find clear. Certainly\nit is true that the Court in Brewer and Jackson saw no\nneed for lengthy disquisitions on the significance of the\ninitial appearance, but that was because it found the\n                     Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                   19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nattachment issue an easy one. The Court’s conclusions\nwere not vague; Brewer expressed “no doubt” that the\nright to counsel attached at the initial appearance, 430\nU. S., at 399, and Jackson said that the opposite result\nwould be “untenable,” 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3.\n  If, indeed, the County had simply taken the cases at face\nvalue, it would have avoided the mistake of merging the\nattachment question (whether formal judicial proceedings\nhave begun) with the distinct “critical stage” question\n(whether counsel must be present at a postattachment\nproceeding unless the right to assistance is validly\nwaived). Attachment occurs when the government has\nused the judicial machinery to signal a commitment to\nprosecute as spelled out in Brewer and Jackson. Once\nattachment occurs, the accused at least15 is entitled to the\npresence of appointed counsel during any “critical stage” of\nthe postattachment proceedings; what makes a stage\ncritical is what shows the need for counsel’s presence.16\nThus, counsel must be appointed within a reasonable time\nafter attachment to allow for adequate representation at\nany critical stage before trial, as well as at trial itself.\n  The County thus makes an analytical mistake in its\nassumption that attachment necessarily requires the\noccurrence or imminence of a critical stage. See Brief for\nRespondent 28–30. On the contrary, it is irrelevant to\nattachment that the presence of counsel at an article 15.17\n——————\n  15 We do not here purport to set out the scope of an individual’s post-\nattachment right to the presence of counsel. It is enough for present\npurposes to highlight that the enquiry into that right is a different one\nfrom the attachment analysis.\n  16 The cases have defined critical stages as proceedings between an\n\nindividual and agents of the State (whether “formal or informal, in\ncourt or out,” see United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967)) that\namount to “trial-like confrontations,” at which counsel would help the\naccused “in coping with legal problems or . . . meeting his adversary,”\nUnited States v. Ash, 413 U. S. 300, 312–313 (1973); see also Massiah v.\nUnited States, 377 U. S. 201 (1964).\n20              ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhearing, say, may not be critical, just as it is irrelevant\nthat counsel’s presence may not be critical when a prose-\ncutor walks over to the trial court to file an information.\nAs we said in Jackson, “[t]he question whether arraign-\nment signals the initiation of adversary judicial proceed-\nings . . . is distinct from the question whether the ar-\nraignment itself is a critical stage requiring the presence\nof counsel.” 475 U. S., at 630, n. 3. Texas’s article 15.17\nhearing plainly signals attachment, even if it is not itself a\ncritical stage.17\n                            III\n   Our holding is narrow. We do not decide whether the 6-\nmonth delay in appointment of counsel resulted in preju-\ndice to Rothgery’s Sixth Amendment rights, and have no\noccasion to consider what standards should apply in decid-\ning this. We merely reaffirm what we have held before\nand what an overwhelming majority of American jurisdic-\ntions understand in practice: a criminal defendant’s initial\nappearance before a judicial officer, where he learns the\ncharge against him and his liberty is subject to restriction,\nmarks the start of adversary judicial proceedings that\ntrigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to coun-\nsel. Because the Fifth Circuit came to a different conclu-\nsion on this threshold issue, its judgment is vacated, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  17 The dissent likewise anticipates an issue distinct from attachment\n\nwhen it claims Rothgery has suffered no harm the Sixth Amendment\nrecognizes. Post, at 18. Whether the right has been violated and\nwhether Rothgery has suffered cognizable harm are separate questions\nfrom when the right attaches, the sole question before us.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

GILLESPIE\n               COUNTY, TEXAS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                         [June 23, 2008]\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and\nJUSTICE SCALIA join, concurring.\n   I join the Court’s opinion because I do not understand it\nto hold that a defendant is entitled to the assistance of\nappointed counsel as soon as his Sixth Amendment right\nattaches. As I interpret our precedents, the term “attach-\nment” signifies nothing more than the beginning of the\ndefendant’s prosecution. It does not mark the beginning of\na substantive entitlement to the assistance of counsel. I\nwrite separately to elaborate on my understanding of the\nterm “attachment” and its relationship to the Amend-\nment’s substantive guarantee of “the Assistance of Coun-\nsel for [the] defence.”\n   The Sixth Amendment provides in pertinent part that\n“[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the\nright . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his de-\nfence.” The Amendment thus defines the scope of the\nright to counsel in three ways: It provides who may assert\nthe right (“the accused”); when the right may be asserted\n(“[i]n all criminal prosecutions”); and what the right guar-\nantees (“the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for\nhis defence”).\n   It is in the context of interpreting the Amendment’s\nanswer to the second of these questions—when the right\nmay be asserted—that we have spoken of the right “at-\n2             ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\ntaching.” In Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, 688 (1972), a\nplurality of the Court explained that “a person’s Sixth and\nFourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at\nor after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have\nbeen initiated against him.” A majority of the Court\nelaborated on that explanation in Moore v. Illinois, 434\nU. S. 220 (1977):\n       “In Kirby v. Illinois, the plurality opinion made\n    clear that the right to counsel announced in Wade and\n    Gilbert attaches only to corporeal identifications con-\n    ducted at or after the initiation of adversary judicial\n    criminal proceedings—whether by way of formal\n    charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information,\n    or arraignment. This is so because the initiation of\n    such proceedings marks the commencement of the\n    ‘criminal prosecutions’ to which alone the explicit\n    guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable.\n    Thus, in Kirby the plurality held that the prosecu-\n    tion’s evidence of a robbery victim’s one-on-one sta-\n    tionhouse identification of an uncounseled suspect\n    shortly after the suspect’s arrest was admissible be-\n    cause adversary judicial criminal proceedings had not\n    yet been initiated.” Id., at 226–227 (internal quota-\n    tion marks and citations omitted).\nWhen we wrote in Kirby and Moore that the Sixth\nAmendment right had “attached,” we evidently meant\nnothing more than that a “criminal prosecutio[n]” had\nbegun. Our cases have generally used the term in that\nnarrow fashion. See Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162, 167\n(2001) (internal quotation marks omitted); McNeil v.\nWisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 175 (1991); Michigan v. Harvey,\n494 U. S. 344, 353 (1990); Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U. S.\n249, 254–255 (1988); Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625,\n629, and n. 3 (1986); Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 428\n(1986); United States v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180, 188\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

S. 454, 469 (1981) (“[W]e have held that the right to\ncounsel granted by the Sixth Amendment means that a\nperson is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the\ntime that adversary judicial proceedings have been initi-\nated against him . . .” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nBrewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387, 398 (1977) (“[T]he right\nto counsel granted by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments means at least that a person is entitled to the help\nof a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings\nhave been initiated against him . . .”).\n   Because pretrial criminal procedures vary substantially\nfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction, there is room for dis-\nagreement about when a “prosecution” begins for Sixth\nAmendment purposes. As the Court, notes, however, we\nhave previously held that “arraignments” that were func-\ntionally indistinguishable from the Texas magistration\nmarked the point at which the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel “attached.” See ante, at 6 (discussing Jackson,\nsupra, and Brewer, supra).\n   It does not follow, however, and I do not understand the\nCourt to hold, that the county had an obligation to appoint\nan attorney to represent petitioner within some specified\nperiod after his magistration. To so hold, the Court would\nneed to do more than conclude that petitioner’s criminal\nprosecution had begun. It would also need to conclude\nthat the assistance of counsel in the wake of a Texas\nmagistration is part of the substantive guarantee of the\nSixth Amendment. That question lies beyond our reach,\npetitioner having never sought our review of it. See Pet.\nfor Cert. i (inviting us to decide whether the Fifth Circuit\n4             ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nerred in concluding “that adversary judicial proceedings\n. . . had not commenced, and petitioner’s Sixth Amend-\nment rights had not attached”). To recall the framework\nlaid out earlier, we have been asked to address only the\nwhen question, not the what question. Whereas the tem-\nporal scope of the right is defined by the words “[i]n all\ncriminal prosecutions,” the right’s substantive guarantee\nflows from a different textual font: the words “Assistance\nof Counsel for his defence.”\n    In interpreting this latter phrase, we have held that\n“defence” means defense at trial, not defense in relation to\nother objectives that may be important to the accused.\nSee Gouveia, supra, at 190 (“[T]he right to counsel exists\nto protect the accused during trial-type confrontations\nwith the prosecutor . . .”); Ash, supra, at 309 (“[T]he core\npurpose of the counsel guarantee was to assure ‘Assis-\ntance’ at trial . . .”). We have thus rejected the argument\nthat the Sixth Amendment entitles the criminal defendant\nto the assistance of appointed counsel at a probable cause\nhearing. See Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 122–123\n(1975) (observing that the Fourth Amendment hearing “is\naddressed only to pretrial custody” and has an insubstan-\ntial effect on the defendant’s trial rights). More generally,\nwe have rejected the notion that the right to counsel enti-\ntles the defendant to a “preindictment private investiga-\ntor.” Gouveia, supra, at 191.\n    At the same time, we have recognized that certain pre-\ntrial events may so prejudice the outcome of the defen-\ndant’s prosecution that, as a practical matter, the defen-\ndant must be represented at those events in order to enjoy\ngenuinely effective assistance at trial. See, e.g., Ash,\nsupra, at 309–310; United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218,\n226 (1967). Thus, we have held that an indigent defen-\ndant is entitled to the assistance of appointed counsel at a\npreliminary hearing if “substantial prejudice . . . inheres\nin the . . . confrontation” and “counsel [may] help avoid\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nthat prejudice.” Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1, 9\n(1970) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted); see also White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59, 60 (1963)\n(per curiam). We have also held that the assistance of\ncounsel is guaranteed at a pretrial lineup, since “the con-\nfrontation compelled by the State between the accused and\nthe victim or witnesses to a crime to elicit identification\nevidence is peculiarly riddled with innumerable dangers\nand variable factors which might seriously, even crucially,\nderogate from a fair trial.” Wade, supra, at 228. Other\n“critical stages” of the prosecution include pretrial interro-\ngation, a pretrial psychiatric exam, and certain kinds of\narraignments. See Harvey, 494 U. S., at 358, n. 4; Estelle,\nsupra, at 470–471; Coleman, supra, at 7–8 (plurality\nopinion).\n   Weaving together these strands of authority, I interpret\nthe Sixth Amendment to require the appointment of coun-\nsel only after the defendant’s prosecution has begun, and\nthen only as necessary to guarantee the defendant effec-\ntive assistance at trial. Cf. McNeil, 501 U. S., at 177–178\n(“The purpose of the Sixth Amendment counsel guaran-\ntee—and hence the purpose of invoking it—is to protec[t]\nthe unaided layman at critical confrontations with his\nexpert adversary, the government, after the adverse posi-\ntions of government and defendant have solidified with\nrespect to a particular alleged crime” (emphasis and al-\nteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted)). It\nfollows that defendants in Texas will not necessarily be\nentitled to the assistance of counsel within some specified\nperiod after their magistrations. See ante, at 19 (opinion\nof the Court) (pointing out the “analytical mistake” of\nassuming “that attachment necessarily requires the occur-\nrence or imminence of a critical stage”). Texas counties\nneed only appoint counsel as far in advance of trial, and as\nfar in advance of any pretrial “critical stage,” as necessary\nto guarantee effective assistance at trial.         Cf. ibid.\n6             ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n(“[C]ounsel must be appointed within a reasonable time\nafter attachment to allow for adequate representation at\nany critical stage before trial, as well as at trial itself”\n(emphasis added)).\n   The Court expresses no opinion on whether Gillespie\nCounty satisfied that obligation in this case. Petitioner\nhas asked us to decide only the limited question whether\nhis magistration marked the beginning of his “criminal\nprosecutio[n]” within the meaning of the Sixth Amend-\nment. Because I agree with the Court’s resolution of that\nlimited question, I join its opinion in full.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

GILLESPIE\n               COUNTY, TEXAS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                        [June 23, 2008]\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.\n  The Court holds today—for the first time after plenary\nconsideration of the question—that a criminal prosecution\nbegins, and that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\ntherefore attaches, when an individual who has been\nplaced under arrest makes an initial appearance before a\nmagistrate for a probable-cause determination and the\nsetting of bail. Because the Court’s holding is not sup-\nported by the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment or\nany reasonable interpretation of our precedents, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n                              I\n   The Sixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have\nthe Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” The text of the\nSixth Amendment thus makes clear that the right to\ncounsel arises only upon initiation of a “criminal prosecu-\ntio[n].” For that reason, the Court has repeatedly stressed\nthat the Sixth Amendment right to counsel “does not\nattach until a prosecution is commenced.” McNeil v.\nWisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 175 (1991); see also United\nStates v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180, 188 (1984) (“[T]he literal\nlanguage of the Amendment . . . requires the existence of\nboth a ‘criminal prosecutio[n]’ and an ‘accused’ ”). Echoing\n2             ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthis refrain, the Court today reiterates that “[t]he Sixth\nAmendment right of the ‘accused’ to assistance of counsel\nin ‘all criminal prosecutions’ is limited by its terms.” Ante,\nat 5 (footnote omitted).\n  Given the Court’s repeated insistence that the right to\ncounsel is textually limited to “criminal prosecutions,” one\nwould expect the Court’s jurisprudence in this area to be\ngrounded in an understanding of what those words meant\nwhen the Sixth Amendment was adopted. Inexplicably,\nhowever, neither today’s decision nor any of the other\nnumerous decisions in which the Court has construed the\nright to counsel has attempted to discern the original\nmeaning of “criminal prosecutio[n].” I think it appropriate\nto examine what a “criminal prosecutio[n]” would have\nbeen understood to entail by those who adopted the Sixth\nAmendment.\n                             A\n  There is no better place to begin than with Blackstone,\n“whose works constituted the preeminent authority on\nEnglish law for the founding generation.” Alden v. Maine,\n527 U. S. 706, 715 (1999). Blackstone devoted more than\n100 pages of his Commentaries on the Laws of England to\na discussion of the “regular and ordinary method of pro-\nceeding in the courts of criminal jurisdiction.” 4 W. Black-\nstone, Commentaries *289 (hereinafter Blackstone).\n  At the outset of his discussion, Blackstone organized the\nvarious stages of a criminal proceeding “under twelve\ngeneral heads, following each other in a progressive or-\nder.” Ibid. The first six relate to pretrial events: “1. Ar-\nrest; 2. Commitment and bail; 3. Prosecution; 4. Process; 5.\nArraignment, and it’s incidents; 6. Plea, and issue.” Ibid.\n(emphasis added). Thus, the first significant fact is that\nBlackstone did not describe the entire criminal process as\na “prosecution,” but rather listed prosecution as the third\nstep in a list of successive stages.

There, Black-\nstone explained that—after arrest and examination by a\njustice of the peace to determine whether a suspect should\nbe discharged, committed to prison, or admitted to bail,\nid., at *296—the “next step towards the punishment of\noffenders is their prosecution, or the manner of their for-\nmal accusation,” id., at *301 (emphasis added).\n   Blackstone thus provides a definition of “prosecution”:\nthe manner of an offender’s “formal accusation.” The\nmodifier “formal” is significant because it distinguishes\n“prosecution” from earlier stages of the process involving a\ndifferent kind of accusation: the allegation of criminal\nconduct necessary to justify arrest and detention. Black-\nstone’s discussion of arrest, commitment, and bail makes\nclear that a person could not be arrested and detained\nwithout a “charge” or “accusation,” i.e., an allegation,\nsupported by probable cause, that the person had commit-\nted a crime. See id., at *289–*300. But the accusation\njustifying arrest and detention was clearly preliminary to\nthe “formal accusation” that Blackstone identified with\n“prosecution.” See id., at *290, *318.\n   By “formal accusation,” Blackstone meant, in most\ncases, “indictment, the most usual and effectual means of\nprosecution.” Id., at *302. Blackstone defined an “indict-\nment” as “a written accusation of one or more persons of a\ncrime or misdemeanor, preferred to, and presented upon\noath by, a grand jury.” Ibid. (emphasis deleted). If the\ngrand jury was “satisfied of the truth of the accusation,” it\nendorsed the indictment, id., at *305–*306, which was\nthen “publicly delivered into court,” id., at *306, “after-\nwards to be tried and determined,” id., at *303, “before an\nofficer having power to punish the [charged] offence,” 2 T.\nCunningham, A New and Complete Law Dictionary (2d ed.\n1771).\n4             ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   In addition to indictment, Blackstone identified two\nother “methods of prosecution at the suit of the king.” 4\nBlackstone *312. The first was presentment, which, like\nan indictment, was a grand jury’s formal accusation “of an\noffence, inquirable in the Court where it [was] presented.”\n5 G. Jacob, The Law-Dictionary 278–279 (1811). The\nprincipal difference was that the accusation arose from\n“the notice taken by a grand jury of any offence from their\nown knowledge or observation” rather than from a “bill of\nindictment laid before them.” 4 Blackstone *301. The\nsecond was information, “the only species of proceeding at\nthe suit of the king, without a previous indictment or\npresentment by a grand jury.” Id., at *308. After an\ninformation was filed, it was “tried,” id., at *309, in the\nsame way as an indictment: “The same notice was given,\nthe same process was issued, the same pleas were allowed,\nthe same trial by jury was had, the same judgment was\ngiven by the same judges, as if the prosecution had origi-\nnally been by indictment,” id., at *310.\n   From the foregoing, the basic elements of a criminal\n“prosecution” emerge with reasonable clarity. “Prosecu-\ntion,” as Blackstone used the term, referred to “instituting\na criminal suit,” id., at *309, by filing a formal charging\ndocument—an indictment, presentment, or information—\nupon which the defendant was to be tried in a court with\npower to punish the alleged offense. And, significantly,\nBlackstone’s usage appears to have accorded with the\nordinary meaning of the term. See 2 N. Webster, An\nAmerican Dictionary of the English Language (1828)\n(defining “prosecution” as “[t]he institution or commence-\nment and continuance of a criminal suit; the process of\nexhibiting formal charges against an offender before a\nlegal tribunal, and pursuing them to final judgment,” and\nnoting that “[p]rosecutions may be by presentment, infor-\nmation or indictment”).\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

S. Const., Amdt. 5 (“No person . . . shall be compelled in\nany criminal case to be a witness against himself”).\n  In Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547 (1892), the\nCourt indicated that the difference in phraseology was not\naccidental. There the Court held that the Fifth Amend-\nment right not to be compelled to be a witness against\noneself “in any criminal case” could be invoked by a wit-\nness testifying before a grand jury. The Court rejected the\nargument that there could be no “criminal case” prior to\nindictment, reasoning that a “criminal case” under the\nFifth Amendment is much broader than a “criminal prose-\ncutio[n]” under the Sixth Amendment. Id., at 563.\n  The following Term, the Court construed the phrase\n“criminal prosecution” in a statutory context, and this\ntime the Court squarely held that a “prosecution” does not\nencompass preindictment stages of the criminal process.\nIn Virginia v. Paul, 148 U. S. 107 (1893), the Court con-\nsidered Revised Statute §643, which authorized removal to\nfederal court of any “ ‘criminal prosecution’ ” “ ‘commenced\nin any court of a State’ ” against a federal officer. Id., at\n115. The respondent, a deputy marshal, had been ar-\nrested by Virginia authorities on a warrant for murder\nand was held in county jail awaiting his appearance before\na justice of the peace “with a view to a commitment to\nawait the action of the grand jury.” Id., at 118. He filed a\npetition for removal of “ ‘said cause’ ” to federal court. Ibid.\nThe question before the Court was whether a “ ‘criminal\nprosecution’ ” had “ ‘commenced’ ” within the meaning of\n6             ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe statute at the time the respondent filed his removal\npetition.\n   The Court held that a criminal prosecution had not com-\nmenced, and that removal was therefore not authorized by\nthe terms of the statute. The Court noted that under Vir-\nginia law murder could be prosecuted only “by indictment\nfound in the county court,” and that “a justice of the peace,\nupon a previous complaint, [could] do no more than to\nexamine whether there [was] good cause for believing that\nthe accused [was] guilty, and to commit him for trial before\nthe court having jurisdiction of the offence.” Ibid. Accord-\ningly, where “no indictment was found, or other action\ntaken, in the county court,” there was as yet no “ ‘criminal\nprosecution.’ ” Id., at 119. The appearance before the jus-\ntice of the peace did not qualify as a “prosecution”:\n    “Proceedings before a magistrate to commit a person\n    to jail, or to hold him to bail, in order to secure his ap-\n    pearance to answer for a crime or offence which the\n    magistrate has no jurisdiction himself to try, before\n    the court in which he may be prosecuted and tried,\n    are but preliminary to the prosecution, and are no\n    more a commencement of the prosecution, than is an\n    arrest by an officer without a warrant for a felony\n    committed in his presence.” Ibid.\n                             C\n   The foregoing historical summary is strong evidence\nthat the term “criminal prosecutio[n]” in the Sixth\nAmendment refers to the commencement of a criminal suit\nby filing formal charges in a court with jurisdiction to try\nand punish the defendant. And on this understanding of\nthe Sixth Amendment, it is clear that petitioner’s initial\nappearance before the magistrate did not commence a\n“criminal prosecutio[n].” No formal charges had been\nfiled. The only document submitted to the magistrate was\nthe arresting officer’s affidavit of probable cause. The\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nofficer stated that he “ha[d] good reason to believe” that\npetitioner was a felon and had been “walking around [an]\nRV park with a gun belt on, carrying a pistol, handcuffs,\nmace spray, extra bullets and a knife.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 33a. The officer therefore “charge[d]” that petitioner\nhad “commit[ted] the offense of unlawful possession of a\nfirearm by a felon—3rd degree felony.” Ibid. The magis-\ntrate certified that he had examined the affidavit and\n“determined that probable cause existed for the arrest of\nthe individual accused therein.” Id., at 34a. Later that\nday, petitioner was released on bail, and did not hear from\nthe State again until he was indicted six months later.\n   The affidavit of probable cause clearly was not the type\nof formal accusation Blackstone identified with the com-\nmencement of a criminal “prosecution.” Rather, it was the\npreliminary accusation necessary to justify arrest and\ndetention—stages of the criminal process that Blackstone\nplaced before prosecution. The affidavit was not a plead-\ning that instituted a criminal prosecution, such as an\nindictment, presentment, or information; and the magis-\ntrate to whom it was presented had no jurisdiction to try\nand convict petitioner for the felony offense charged\ntherein. See Teal v. State, 230 S. W. 3d 172, 174 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2007) (“The Texas Constitution requires that,\nunless waived by the defendant, the State must obtain a\ngrand jury indictment in a felony case”); Tex. Crim. Proc.\nCode Ann., Arts. 4.05, 4.11(a) (West 2005). That is most\nassuredly why the magistrate informed petitioner that\ncharges “will be filed” in district court. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 35a (emphasis added).\n   The original meaning of the Sixth Amendment, then,\ncuts decisively against the Court’s conclusion that peti-\ntioner’s right to counsel attached at his initial appearance\nbefore the magistrate. But we are not writing on a blank\nslate: This Court has a substantial body of more recent\nprecedent construing the Sixth Amendment right to coun-\n8               ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsel.\n                             II\n   As the Court notes, our cases have “pegged commence-\nment” of a criminal prosecution, ante, at 5, to “the initia-\ntion of adversary judicial criminal proceedings—whether\nby way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment,\ninformation, or arraignment,” Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S.\n682, 689 (1972) (plurality opinion). The Court has re-\npeated this formulation in virtually every right-to-counsel\ncase decided since Kirby. Because Kirby’s formulation of\nthe attachment test has been accorded such precedential\nsignificance, it is important to determine precisely what\nKirby said:\n          “In a line of constitutional cases in this Court stem-\n       ming back to the Court’s landmark opinion in Powell\n       v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 [(1932)], it has been firmly\n       established that a person’s Sixth and Fourteenth\n       Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after\n       the time that adversary judicial proceedings have\n       been initiated against him. See Powell v. Alabama,\n       supra; Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 [(1938)]; Ham-\n       ilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 [(1961)]; Gideon v.\n       Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 [(1963)]; White v. Mary-\n       land, 373 U. S. 59 [(1963) (per curiam)]; Massiah v.\n       United States, 377 U. S. 201 [(1964)]; United States v.\n       Wade, 388 U. S. 218 [(1967)]; Gilbert v. California,\n       388 U. S. 263 [(1967)]; Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S.\n       1 [(1970)].\n          “This is not to say that a defendant in a criminal\n       case has a constitutional right to counsel only at the\n       trial itself. The Powell case makes clear that the right\n       attaches at the time of arraignment, and the Court\n       has recently held that it exists also at the time of a\n       preliminary hearing. Coleman v. Alabama, supra.\n       But the point is that, while members of the Court\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n    have differed as to existence of the right to counsel in\n    the contexts of some of the above cases, all of those\n    cases have involved points of time at or after the ini-\n    tiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings—\n    whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hear-\n    ing, indictment, information, or arraignment.” Id., at\n    688–689 (footnote omitted).\n   It is noteworthy that Kirby did not purport to announce\nanything new; rather, it simply catalogued what the Court\nhad previously held. And the point of the plurality’s dis-\ncussion was that the criminal process contains stages\nprior to commencement of a criminal prosecution. The\nholding of the case was that the right to counsel did not\napply at a station house lineup that took place “before the\ndefendant had been indicted or otherwise formally charged\nwith any criminal offense.” Id., at 684.\n   Kirby gave five examples of events that initiate “adver-\nsary judicial criminal proceedings”: formal charge, pre-\nliminary hearing, indictment, information, and arraign-\nment. None of these supports the result the Court reaches\ntoday. I will apply them seriatim. No indictment or in-\nformation had been filed when petitioner appeared before\nthe magistrate. Nor was there any other formal charge.\nAlthough the plurality in Kirby did not define “formal\ncharge,” there is no reason to believe it would have in-\ncluded an affidavit of probable cause in that category.\nNone of the cases on which it relied stood for that proposi-\ntion. Indeed, all of them—with the exception of White v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 59 (1963) (per curiam), and Coleman\nv. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1 (1970)—involved postindictment\nproceedings. See Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 49\n(1932) (postindictment arraignment); Johnson v. Zerbst,\n304 U. S. 458, 460 (1938) (trial); Hamilton v. Alabama,\n368 U. S. 52, 53, n. 3 (1961) (postindictment arraignment);\nGideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 337 (1963) (trial);\n10            ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nMassiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 (1964) (postin-\ndictment interrogation); United States v. Wade, 388 U. S.\n218, 219–220 (1967) (postindictment lineup); Gilbert v.\nCalifornia, 388 U. S. 263, 269 (1967) (postindictment\nlineup).\n   Nor was petitioner’s initial appearance a preliminary\nhearing. The comparable proceeding in Texas is called an\n“examining trial.” See ante, at 9, n. 12. More importantly,\npetitioner’s initial appearance was unlike the preliminary\nhearings that were held to constitute “critical stages” in\nWhite and Coleman, because it did not involve entry of a\nplea, cf. White, supra, at 60, and was nonadversarial, cf.\nColeman, supra, at 9. There was no prosecutor present,\nthere were no witnesses to cross-examine, there was no\ncase to discover, and the result of the proceeding was not\nto bind petitioner over to the grand jury or the trial court.\n   Finally, petitioner’s initial appearance was not what\nKirby described as an “arraignment.” An arraignment, in\nits traditional and usual sense, is a postindictment pro-\nceeding at which the defendant enters a plea. See, e.g.,\nW. LaFave, J. Israel, & N. King, Criminal Procedure\n§1.3(n), p. 19 (4th ed. 2004); 4 Blackstone *322. Although\nthe word “arraignment” is sometimes used to describe an\ninitial appearance before a magistrate, see LaFave, supra,\n§1.3(j), at 16, that is not what Kirby meant when it said\nthat the right to counsel attaches at an “arraignment.”\nRather, it meant the traditional, postindictment arraign-\nment where the defendant enters a plea. This would be\nthe most reasonable assumption even if there were noth-\ning else to go on, since that is the primary meaning of the\nword, especially when used unmodified.\n   But there is no need to assume. Kirby purported to\ndescribe only what the Court had already held, and none\nof the cases Kirby cited involved an initial appearance.\nOnly two of the cases involved arraignments, and both\nwere postindictment arraignments at which the defendant\n                    Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                  11\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nentered a plea. Hamilton, supra, at 53, n. 3; Powell, 287\nU. S., at 49. And the considerations that drove the Court’s\nanalysis in those cases are not present here. See id., at 57\n(emphasizing that “from the time of their arraignment\nuntil the beginning of their trial, when consultation, thor-\noughgoing investigation and preparation were vitally\nimportant, the defendants did not have the aid of coun-\nsel”); Hamilton, supra, at 53–55 (emphasizing that the\ndefendant entered a plea and was required to raise or\nwaive certain defenses). Kirby’s inclusion of “arraign-\nment” in the list of adversary judicial proceedings that\ntrigger the right to counsel thus provides no support for\nthe view that the right to counsel attaches at an initial\nappearance before a magistrate.\n                            III\n   It is clear that when Kirby was decided in 1972 there\nwas no precedent in this Court for the conclusion that a\ncriminal prosecution begins, and the right to counsel\ntherefore attaches, at an initial appearance before a mag-\nistrate. The Court concludes, however, that two subse-\nquent decisions—Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387 (1977),\nand Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986)—stand for\nthat proposition. Those decisions, which relied almost\nexclusively on Kirby, cannot bear the weight the Court\nputs on them.1\n   In Brewer, the defendant challenged his conviction for\nmurdering a 10-year-old girl on the ground that his Sixth\n——————\n  1 The Court also relies on McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171 (1991),\n\nto support its assertion that the right to counsel attaches upon an\ninitial appearance before a magistrate. Ante, at 10–11. But in McNeil,\nthe Court expressed no view whatsoever on the attachment issue.\nRather, it noted that the issue was “undisputed,” and “accept[ed] for\npurposes of the present case, that . . . [the defendant’s] Sixth Amend-\nment right had attached.” 501 U. S., at 175. We do not ordinarily give\nweight to assumptions made in prior cases about matters that were not\nin dispute.\n12            ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nAmendment right to counsel had been violated when\ndetectives elicited incriminating statements from him\nwhile transporting him from Davenport, Iowa, where he\nhad been arrested on a warrant for abduction and “ar-\nraigned before a judge . . . on the outstanding arrest war-\nrant,” to Des Moines, where he was to be tried. 430 U. S.,\nat 390–391. The principal issue was whether the defen-\ndant had waived his right to have counsel present during\npolice questioning when he voluntarily engaged one of the\ndetectives in a “wide-ranging conversation.” Id., at 392.\nHe subsequently agreed to lead the detectives to the girl’s\nbody in response to the so-called “ ‘Christian burial\nspeech,’ ” in which one of the detectives told the defendant\nthat “ ‘the parents of this little girl should be entitled to a\nChristian burial for the little girl who was snatched away\nfrom them on Christmas [E]ve and murdered.’ ” Id., at\n392–393. Not surprisingly, the parties vigorously disputed\nthe waiver issue, and it sharply divided the Court.\n   In contrast, the question whether the defendant’s right\nto counsel had attached was neither raised in the courts\nbelow nor disputed before this Court. Nonetheless, the\nCourt, after quoting Kirby’s formulation of the test, offered\nits conclusory observations:\n       “There can be no doubt in the present case that ju-\n     dicial proceedings had been initiated against Williams\n     before the start of the automobile ride from Davenport\n     to Des Moines. A warrant had been issued for his ar-\n     rest, he had been arraigned on that warrant before a\n     judge in a Davenport courtroom, and he had been\n     committed by the court to confinement in jail. The\n     State does not contend otherwise.” 430 U. S., at 399.\n    Brewer’s cursory treatment of the attachment issue\ndemonstrates precisely why, when “an issue [is] not ad-\ndressed by the parties,” it is “imprudent of us to address it\n. . . with any pretense of settling it for all time.” Metro-\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 521 U. S. 121, 136 (1997).\nAs an initial matter, the Court’s discussion of the facts\nreveals little about what happened at the proceeding.\nThere is no indication, for example, whether it was adver-\nsarial or whether the defendant was required to enter a\nplea or raise or waive any defenses—facts that earlier\ncases such as Hamilton, White, and Coleman had found\nsignificant.\n   Even assuming, however, that the arraignment in\nBrewer was functionally identical to the initial appearance\nhere, Brewer offered no reasoning for its conclusion that\nthe right to counsel attached at such a proceeding. One is\nleft with the distinct impression that the Court simply saw\nthe word “arraignment” in Kirby’s attachment test and\nconcluded that the right must have attached because the\ndefendant had been “arraigned.” There is no indication\nthat Brewer considered the difference between an ar-\nraignment on a warrant and an arraignment at which the\ndefendant pleads to the indictment.\n   The Court finds it significant that Brewer expressed “ ‘no\ndoubt’ ” that the right had attached. Ante, at 19 (quoting\n430 U. S., at 399). There was no need for a “lengthy dis-\nquisitio[n],” the Court says, because Brewer purportedly\n“found the attachment issue an easy one.” Ante, at 18–19.\nWhat the Court neglects to mention is that Brewer’s at-\ntachment holding is indisputably no longer good law. That\nis because we have subsequently held that the Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel is “offense specific,” meaning\nthat it attaches only to those offenses for which the defen-\ndant has been formally charged, and not to “other offenses\n‘closely related factually’ to the charged offense.” Texas v.\nCobb, 532 U. S. 162, 164 (2001). Because the defendant in\nBrewer had been arraigned only on the abduction warrant,\nthere is no doubt that, under Cobb, his right to counsel\nhad not yet attached with respect to the murder charges\nthat were subsequently brought. See 532 U. S., at 184\n14            ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(BREYER, J., dissenting) (noting that under the majority’s\nrule, “[the defendant’s] murder conviction should have\nremained undisturbed”). But the Court in Cobb did not\nconsider itself bound by Brewer’s implicit holding on the\nattachment question. See 532 U. S., at 169 (“Constitu-\ntional rights are not defined by inferences from opinions\nwhich did not address the question at issue”). And here,\nas in Cobb, Brewer did not address the fact that the ar-\nraignment on the warrant was not the same type of ar-\nraignment at which the right to counsel had previously\nbeen held to attach, and the parties did not argue the\nquestion. Brewer is thus entitled to no more precedential\nweight here than it was in Cobb.\n   Nor does Jackson control. In Jackson, as in Brewer, the\nattachment issue was secondary. The question presented\nwas “not whether respondents had a right to counsel at\ntheir postarraignment, custodial interrogations,” 475\nU. S., at 629, but “whether respondents validly waived\ntheir right to counsel,” id., at 630. And, as in Brewer, the\nCourt’s waiver holding was vigorously disputed. See 475\nU. S., at 637–642 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); see also\nCobb, supra, at 174–177 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (ques-\ntioning Jackson’s vitality). Unlike in Brewer, however, the\nattachment question was at least contested in Jackson—\nbut barely. With respect to respondent Jackson, the State\nconceded the issue. Jackson, supra, at 629, n. 3. And with\nrespect to respondent Bladel, the State had conceded the\nissue below, see People v. Bladel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77, 365\nN.

Bladel, O. T. 1985, No. 84–1539, pp. 24–26.\n   The Court disposed of the issue in a footnote. See Jack-\nson, supra, at 629–630, n. 3. As in Brewer, the Court did\nnot describe the nature of the proceeding. It stated only\nthat the respondents were “arraigned.” 475 U. S., at 627–\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

The Court phrased the question presented in terms\nof “arraignment,” id., at 626 (“The question presented by\nthese two cases is whether the same rule applies to a\ndefendant who has been formally charged with a crime\nand who has requested appointment of counsel at his\narraignment”), and repeated the words “arraignment” or\n“postarraignment” no fewer than 35 times in the course of\nits opinion.\n   There is no way to know from the Court’s opinion in\nJackson whether the arraignment at issue there was the\nsame type of arraignment at which the right to counsel\nhad been held to attach in Powell and Hamilton. Only\nupon examination of the parties’ briefs does it become\nclear that the proceeding was in fact an initial appearance.\nBut Jackson did not even acknowledge, much less “flatly\nrejec[t] the distinction between initial arraignment and\narraignment on the indictment.” Ante, at 9. Instead, it\noffered one sentence of analysis—“In view of the clear\nlanguage in our decisions about the significance of ar-\nraignment, the State’s argument is untenable”—followed\nby a string citation to four cases, each of which quoted\nKirby. 475 U. S., at 629–630, n. 3. For emphasis, the\nCourt italicized the words “or arraignment” in Kirby’s\nattachment test. 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   The only rule that can be derived from the face of the\nopinion in Jackson is that if a proceeding is called an\n“arraignment,” the right to counsel attaches.2 That rule\n——————\n  2 The  Court asserts that Jackson’s “conclusion was driven by the\nsame considerations the Court had endorsed in Brewer,” namely, that\n“by the time a defendant is brought before a judicial officer, is informed\nof a formally lodged accusation, and has restrictions imposed on his\nliberty in aid of the prosecution, the State’s relationship with the\ndefendant has become solidly adversarial.” Ante, at 9. But Jackson\nsaid nothing of the sort.\n     Moreover, even looking behind the opinion, Jackson does not sup-\n16              ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwould not govern this case because petitioner’s initial\nappearance was not called an “arraignment” (the parties\nrefer to it as a “magistration”). And that would, in any\ncase, be a silly rule. The Sixth Amendment consequences\nof a proceeding should turn on the substance of what\nhappens there, not on what the State chooses to call it.\nBut the Court in Jackson did not focus on the substantive\ndistinction between an initial arraignment and an ar-\nraignment on the indictment. Instead, the Court simply\ncited Kirby and left it at that. In these circumstances, I\nwould recognize Jackson for what it was—a cursory\ntreatment of an issue that was not the primary focus of\nthe Court’s opinion. Surely Jackson’s footnote must yield\nto our reasoned precedents.\n   And our reasoned precedents provide no support for the\nconclusion that the right to counsel attaches at an initial\nappearance before a magistrate. Kirby explained why the\nright attaches “after the initiation of adversary judicial\ncriminal proceedings”:\n       “The initiation of judicial criminal proceedings is far\n     from a mere formalism. It is the starting point of our\n——————\nport the result the Court reaches today. Respondent Bladel entered a\n“not guilty” plea at his arraignment, see Brief for Petitioner in Michi-\ngan v. Bladel, O. T. 1985, No. 84–1539, p. 4, and both Hamilton v.\nAlabama, 368 U. S. 52 (1961), and White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59\n(1963) (per curiam), had already held that a defendant has a right to\ncounsel when he enters a plea. The Court suggests that this fact is\nirrelevant because the magistrate in Bladel’s case “had no jurisdiction\nto accept a plea of guilty to a felony charge.” Ante, at 10, n. 13. But\nthat distinction does not appear in either Hamilton or White. See\nHamilton, supra, at 55 (“Only the presence of counsel could have\nenabled this accused to know all the defenses available to him and to\nplead intelligently”); White, supra, at 60 (“[P]etitioner entered a plea\nbefore the magistrate and that plea was taken at a time when he had\nno counsel”). Thus, the most that Jackson can possibly be made to\nstand for is that the right to counsel attaches at an initial appearance\nwhere the defendant enters a plea. And that rule would not govern this\ncase because petitioner did not enter a plea at his initial appearance.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n    whole system of adversary criminal justice. For it is\n    only then that the government has committed itself to\n    prosecute, and only then that the adverse positions of\n    government and defendant have solidified. It is then\n    that a defendant finds himself faced with the prosecu-\n    torial forces of organized society, and immersed in the\n    intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law.\n    It is this point, therefore, that marks the commence-\n    ment of the ‘criminal prosecutions’ to which alone the\n    explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are ap-\n    plicable.” 406 U. S., at 689–690 (plurality opinion).\n  None of these defining characteristics of a “criminal\nprosecution” applies to petitioner’s initial appearance\nbefore the magistrate. The initial appearance was not an\n“adversary” proceeding, and petitioner was not “faced with\nthe prosecutorial forces of organized society.” Instead, he\nstood in front of a “little glass window,” filled out various\nforms, and was read his Miranda rights. Brief for Re-\nspondent 5. The State had not committed itself to prose-\ncute—only a prosecutor may file felony charges in Texas,\nsee Tex. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. Arts. 2.01, 2.02 (West\n2005), and there is no evidence that any prosecutor was\neven aware of petitioner’s arrest or appearance. The\nadverse positions of government and defendant had not\nyet solidified—the State’s prosecutorial officers had not\nyet decided whether to press charges and, if so, which\ncharges to press. And petitioner was not immersed in the\nintricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law—\nshortly after the proceeding he was free on bail, and no\nfurther proceedings occurred until six months later when\nhe was indicted.\n  Moreover, the Court’s holding that the right to counsel\nattaches at an initial appearance is untethered from any\ninterest that we have heretofore associated with the right\nto counsel. The Court has repeatedly emphasized that\n18            ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n“[t]he purpose of the constitutional guaranty of a right to\ncounsel is to protect an accused from conviction resulting\nfrom his own ignorance of his legal and constitutional\nrights.” Johnson, 304 U. S., at 465. The “core purpose” of\nthe right, the Court has said, is to “assure ‘Assistance’ at\ntrial, when the accused [is] confronted with both the intri-\ncacies of the law and the advocacy of the public prosecu-\ntor.” United States v. Ash, 413 U. S. 300, 309 (1973). The\nCourt has extended the right to counsel to pretrial events\nonly when the absence of counsel would derogate from the\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial. See, e.g., Wade, 388 U. S.,\nat 227.\n   Neither petitioner nor the Court identifies any way in\nwhich petitioner’s ability to receive a fair trial was under-\nmined by the absence of counsel during the period between\nhis initial appearance and his indictment. Nothing during\nthat period exposed petitioner to the risk that he would be\nconvicted as the result of ignorance of his rights. Instead,\nthe gravamen of petitioner’s complaint is that if counsel\nhad been appointed earlier, he would have been able to\nstave off indictment by convincing the prosecutor that\npetitioner was not guilty of the crime alleged. But the\nSixth Amendment protects against the risk of erroneous\nconviction, not the risk of unwarranted prosecution. See\nGouveia, 467 U. S., at 191 (rejecting the notion that the\n“purpose of the right to counsel is to provide a defendant\nwith a preindictment private investigator”).\n   Petitioner argues that the right to counsel is implicated\nhere because restrictions were imposed on his liberty\nwhen he was required to post bail. But we have never\nsuggested that the accused’s right to the assistance of\ncounsel “for his defence” entails a right to use counsel as a\nsword to contest pretrial detention. To the contrary, we\nhave flatly rejected that notion, reasoning that a defen-\ndant’s liberty interests are protected by other constitu-\ntional guarantees. See id., at 190 (“While the right to\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

GILLESPIE COUNTY, TEXAS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 07–440.      Argued March 17, 2008—Decided June 23, 2008\nTexas police relied on erroneous information that petitioner Rothgery\n  had a previous felony conviction to arrest him as a felon in possession\n  of a firearm. The officers brought Rothgery before a magistrate\n  judge, as required by state law, for a so-called “article 15.17 hearing,”\n  at which the Fourth Amendment probable-cause determination was\n  made, bail was set, and Rothgery was formally apprised of the accu-\n  sation against him. After the hearing, the magistrate judge commit-\n  ted Rothgery to jail, and he was released after posting a surety bond.\n  Rothgery had no money for a lawyer and made several unheeded oral\n  and written requests for appointed counsel. He was subsequently in-\n  dicted and rearrested, his bail was increased, and he was jailed when\n  he could not post the bail. Subsequently, Rothgery was assigned a\n  lawyer, who assembled the paperwork that prompted the indict-\n  ment’s dismissal.\n     Rothgery then brought this 42 U. S. C. §1983 action against re-\n  spondent County, claiming that if it had provided him a lawyer\n  within a reasonable time after the article 15.17 hearing, he would not\n  have been indicted, rearrested, or jailed. He asserts that the\n  County’s unwritten policy of denying appointed counsel to indigent\n  defendants out on bond until an indictment is entered violates his\n  Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The District Court granted the\n  County summary judgment, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, consider-\n  ing itself bound by Circuit precedent to the effect that the right to\n  counsel did not attach at the article 15.17 hearing because the rele-\n  vant prosecutors were not aware of, or involved in, Rothgery’s arrest\n  or appearance at the hearing, and there was no indication that the of-\n  ficer at Rothgery’s appearance had any power to commit the State to\n  prosecute without a prosecutor’s knowledge or involvement.\n2                ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: A criminal defendant’s initial appearance before a magistrate\n judge, where he learns the charge against him and his liberty is sub-\n ject to restriction, marks the initiation of adversary judicial proceed-\n ings that trigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to coun-\n sel. Attachment does not also require that a prosecutor (as distinct\n from a police officer) be aware of that initial proceeding or involved in\n its conduct. Pp. 5–20.\n    (a) Texas’s article 15.17 hearing marks the point of attachment,\n with the consequent state obligation to appoint counsel within a rea-\n sonable time once a request for assistance is made. This Court has\n twice held that the right to counsel attaches at the initial appearance\n before a judicial officer at which a defendant is told of the formal ac-\n cusation against him and restrictions are imposed on his liberty. See\n Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, 629, n. 3; Brewer v. Williams,\n 430 U. S. 387, 398–399. Rothgery’s hearing was an initial appear-\n ance: he was taken before a magistrate judge, informed of the formal\n accusation against him, and sent to jail until he posted bail. Thus,\n Brewer and Jackson control. Pp. 5–10.\n    (b) In McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 180–181, the Court reaf-\n firmed that “[t]he Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at the\n first formal proceeding against an accused,” and observed that “in\n most States . . . free counsel is made available at that time.” That\n observation remains true today. The overwhelming consensus prac-\n tice conforms to the rule that the first formal proceeding is the point\n of attachment. The Court is advised without contradiction that not\n only the Federal Government, including the District of Columbia, but\n 43 States take the first step toward appointing counsel before, at, or\n just after initial appearance. To the extent the remaining 7 States\n have been denying appointed counsel at that time, they are a distinct\n minority. Pp. 10–12.\n    (c) Neither the Fifth Circuit nor the County offers an acceptable\n justification for the minority practice. Pp. 12–19.\n       (1) The Fifth Circuit found the determining factor to be that no\n prosecutor was aware of Rothgery’s article 15.17 hearing or involved\n in it. This prosecutorial awareness standard is wrong. Neither\n Brewer nor Jackson said a word about the prosecutor’s involvement\n as a relevant fact, much less a controlling one. Those cases left no\n room for the factual enquiry the Circuit would require, and with good\n reason: an attachment rule that turned on determining the moment\n of a prosecutor’s first involvement would be “wholly unworkable and\n impossible to administer,” Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 496.\n The Fifth Circuit derived its rule from the statement, in Kirby v. Illi-\n nois, 406 U. S. 682, 689, that the right to counsel attaches when the\n government has “committed itself to prosecute.” But what counts as\n                      Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                     3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  such a commitment is an issue of federal law unaffected by alloca-\n  tions of power among state officials under state law, cf. Moran v.\n  Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 429, n. 3, and under the federal standard, an\n  accusation filed with a judicial officer is sufficiently formal, and the\n  government’s commitment to prosecute it sufficiently concrete, when\n  the accusation prompts arraignment and restrictions on the accused’s\n  liberty, see, e.g., Kirby, supra, at 689. Pp. 12–15.\n       (2) The County relies on United States v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180,\n  in arguing that in considering the initial appearance’s significance,\n  this Court must ignore prejudice to a defendant’s pretrial liberty, it\n  being the concern, not of the right to counsel, but of the speedy-trial\n  right and the Fourth Amendment. But the County’s suggestion that\n  Fifth Amendment protections at the early stage obviate attachment\n  of the Sixth Amendment right at initial appearance was refuted by\n  Jackson, 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3. And since the Court is not asked to\n  extend the right to counsel to a point earlier than formal judicial pro-\n  ceedings (as in Gouveia), but to defer it to those proceedings in which\n  a prosecutor is involved, Gouveia does not speak to the question at is-\n  sue. Pp. 15–17.\n       (3) The County’s third tack gets it no further. Stipulating that\n  the properly formulated test is whether the State has objectively\n  committed itself to prosecute, the County says that prosecutorial in-\n  volvement is but one form of evidence of such commitment and that\n  others include (1) the filing of formal charges or the holding of an ad-\n  versarial preliminary hearing to determine probable cause to file\n  such charges, and (2) a court appearance following arrest on an in-\n  dictment. Either version runs up against Brewer and Jackson: an\n  initial appearance following a charge signifies a sufficient commit-\n  ment to prosecute regardless of a prosecutor’s participation, indict-\n  ment, information, or what the County calls a “formal” complaint.\n  The County’s assertions that Brewer and Jackson are “vague” and\n  thus of limited, if any, precedential value are wrong. Although the\n  Court in those cases saw no need for lengthy disquisitions on the ini-\n  tial appearance’s significance, that was because it found the attach-\n  ment issue an easy one.

See Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S.\n387, 398–399 (1977); Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625,\n629, n. 3 (1986).

The offi-\ncers lacked a warrant, and so promptly brought Rothgery\nbefore a magistrate judge, as required by Tex. Crim. Proc.\nCode Ann., Art. 14.06(a) (West Supp. 2007).2 Texas law\nhas no formal label for this initial appearance before a\nmagistrate, see 41 G. Dix & R. Dawson, Texas Practice\nSeries: Criminal Practice and Procedure §15.01 (2d ed.\n2001), which is sometimes called the “article 15.17 hear-\ning,” see, e.g., Kirk v. State, 199 S. W. 3d 467, 476–477\n(Tex. App. 2006); it combines the Fourth Amendment’s\nrequired probable-cause determination3 with the setting of\nbail, and is the point at which the arrestee is formally\napprised of the accusation against him, see Tex. Crim.\nProc. Code Ann., Art. 15.17(a).\n   Rothgery’s article 15.17 hearing followed routine. The\narresting officer submitted a sworn “Affidavit Of Probable\nCause” that described the facts supporting the arrest and\n“charge[d] that . . .

The magistrate judge informed Roth-\ngery of the accusation, set his bail at $5,000, and commit-\nted him to jail, from which he was released after posting a\nsurety bond. The bond, which the Gillespie County deputy\nsheriff signed, stated that “Rothgery stands charged by\ncomplaint duly filed . . . with the offense of a . . . felony, to\nwit: Unlawful Possession of a Firearm by a Felon.” Id., at\n39a. The release was conditioned on the defendant’s\npersonal appearance in trial court “for any and all subse-\nquent proceedings that may be had relative to the said\ncharge in the course of the criminal action based on said\ncharge.” Ibid.\n  Rothgery had no money for a lawyer and made several\noral and written requests for appointed counsel,4 which\nwent unheeded.5 The following January, he was indicted\nby a Texas grand jury for unlawful possession of a firearm\nby a felon, resulting in rearrest the next day, and an order\nincreasing bail to $15,000. When he could not post it, he\nwas put in jail and remained there for three weeks.\n  On January 23, 2003, six months after the article 15.17\nhearing, Rothgery was finally assigned a lawyer, who\npromptly obtained a bail reduction (so Rothgery could get\nout of jail), and assembled the paperwork confirming that\nRothgery had never been convicted of a felony. Counsel\nrelayed this information to the district attorney, who in\nturn filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, which was\ngranted.\n\n——————\n  4 Because respondent Gillespie County obtained summary judgment\n\nin the current case, we accept as true that Rothgery made multiple\nrequests.\n  5 Rothgery also requested counsel at the article 15.17 hearing itself,\n\nbut the magistrate judge informed him that the appointment of counsel\nwould delay setting bail (and hence his release from jail). Given the\nchoice of proceeding without counsel or remaining in custody, Rothgery\nwaived the right to have appointed counsel present at the hearing. See\n491 F. 3d, at 295, n. 2.\n4                ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n   Rothgery then brought this 42 U. S. C. §1983 action\nagainst respondent Gillespie County, claiming that if the\nCounty had provided a lawyer within a reasonable time\nafter the article 15.17 hearing, he would not have been\nindicted, rearrested, or jailed for three weeks.         The\nCounty’s failure is said to be owing to its unwritten policy\nof denying appointed counsel to indigent defendants out\non bond until at least the entry of an information or in-\ndictment.6 Rothgery sees this policy as violating his Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel.7\n   The District Court granted summary judgment to the\nCounty, see 413 F. Supp. 2d 806, 807 (WD Tex. 2006), and\nthe Court of Appeals affirmed, see 491 F. 3d 293, 294 (CA5\n2007). The Court of Appeals felt itself bound by Circuit\nprecedent, see id., at 296–297 (citing Lomax v. Alabama,\n629 F. 2d 413 (CA5 1980), and McGee v. Estelle, 625 F. 2d\n1206 (CA5 1980)), to the effect that the Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel did not attach at the article 15.17 hearing,\nbecause “the relevant prosecutors were not aware of or\ninvolved in Rothgery’s arrest or appearance before the\nmagistrate on July 16, 2002,” and “[t]here is also no indi-\ncation that the officer who filed the probable cause affida-\nvit at Rothgery’s appearance had any power to commit the\nstate to prosecute without the knowledge or involvement\nof a prosecutor,” 491 F. 3d, at 297.\n——————\n    6 Rothgerydoes not challenge the County’s written policy for ap-\npointment of counsel, but argues that the County was not following\nthat policy in practice. See 413 F. Supp. 2d 806, 809–810 (WD Tex.\n2006).\n  7 Such a policy, if proven, arguably would also be in violation of Texas\n\nstate law, which appears to require appointment of counsel for indigent\ndefendants released from custody, at the latest, when the “first court\nappearance” is made. See Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann., Art. 1.051(j).\nSee also Brief for Texas Association of Counties et al. as Amici Curiae\n13 (asserting that Rothgery “was statutorily entitled to the appoint-\nment of counsel within three days after having requested it”).\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

S. ___ (2007), and now\nvacate and remand.\n                              II\n   The Sixth Amendment right of the “accused” to assis-\ntance of counsel in “all criminal prosecutions”8 is limited\nby its terms: “it does not attach until a prosecution is\ncommenced.” McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 175\n(1991); see also Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 430\n(1986). We have, for purposes of the right to counsel,\npegged commencement to “ ‘the initiation of adversary\njudicial criminal proceedings—whether by way of formal\ncharge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or\narraignment,’ ” United States v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180,\n188 (1984) (quoting Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, 689\n(1972) (plurality opinion)). The rule is not “mere formal-\nism,” but a recognition of the point at which “the govern-\nment has committed itself to prosecute,” “the adverse\npositions of government and defendant have solidified,”\nand the accused “finds himself faced with the prosecutorial\nforces of organized society, and immersed in the intricacies\nof substantive and procedural criminal law.” Kirby, supra,\nat 689. The issue is whether Texas’s article 15.17 hearing\nmarks that point, with the consequent state obligation to\nappoint counsel within a reasonable time once a request\nfor assistance is made.\n                               A\n  When the Court of Appeals said no, because no prosecu-\ntor was aware of Rothgery’s article 15.17 hearing or in-\nvolved in it, the court effectively focused not on the start of\nadversarial judicial proceedings, but on the activities and\nknowledge of a particular state official who was presuma-\n——————\n  8 The Sixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions,\n\nthe accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel\nfor his defence.”\n6                ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbly otherwise occupied. This was error.\n  As the Court of Appeals recognized, see 491 F. 3d, at\n298, we have twice held that the right to counsel attaches\nat the initial appearance before a judicial officer, see\nJackson, 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3; Brewer 430 U. S., at 399.\nThis first time before a court, also known as the “ ‘prelimi-\nnary arraignment’ ” or “ ‘arraignment on the complaint,’ ”\nsee 1 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal\nProcedure §1.4(g), p. 135 (3d ed. 2007), is generally the\nhearing at which “the magistrate informs the defendant of\nthe charge in the complaint, and of various rights in fur-\nther proceedings,” and “determine[s] the conditions for\npretrial release,” ibid. Texas’s article 15.17 hearing is an\ninitial appearance: Rothgery was taken before a magis-\ntrate judge, informed of the formal accusation against\nhim, and sent to jail until he posted bail. See supra, at 2–\n3.9 Brewer and Jackson control.\n  The Brewer defendant surrendered to the police after a\nwarrant was out for his arrest on a charge of abduction.\n——————\n  9 The Court of Appeals did not resolve whether the arresting officer’s\n\nformal accusation would count as a “formal complaint” under Texas\nstate law. See 491 F. 3d, at 298–300 (noting the confusion in the Texas\nstate courts). But it rightly acknowledged (albeit in considering the\nseparate question whether the complaint was a “formal charge”) that\nthe constitutional significance of judicial proceedings cannot be allowed\nto founder on the vagaries of state criminal law, lest the attachment\nrule be rendered utterly “vague and unpredictable.” Virginia v. Moore,\n553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 10). See 491 F. 3d, at 300 (“[W]e\nare reluctant to rely on the formalistic question of whether the affidavit\nhere would be considered a ‘complaint’ or its functional equivalent\nunder Texas case law and Article 15.04 of the Texas Code of Criminal\nProcedures—a question to which the answer is itself uncertain. In-\nstead, we must look to the specific circumstances of this case and the\nnature of the affidavit filed at Rothgery’s appearance before the magis-\ntrate” (footnote omitted)). What counts is that the complaint filed with\nthe magistrate judge accused Rothgery of committing a particular\ncrime and prompted the judicial officer to take legal action in response\n(here, to set the terms of bail and order the defendant locked up).\n                      Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nHe was then “arraigned before a judge . . . on the out-\nstanding arrest warrant,” and at the arraignment, “[t]he\njudge advised him of his Miranda [v. Arizona, 384 U. S.\n436 (1966)] rights and committed him to jail.” Brewer, 430\nU. S., at 391. After this preliminary arraignment, and\nbefore an indictment on the abduction charge had been\nhanded up, police elicited incriminating admissions that\nultimately led to an indictment for first-degree murder.\nBecause neither of the defendant’s lawyers had been\npresent when the statements were obtained, the Court\nfound it “clear” that the defendant “was deprived of . . . the\nright to the assistance of counsel.” Id., at 397–398. In\nplain terms, the Court said that “[t]here can be no doubt\nin the present case that judicial proceedings had been\ninitiated” before the defendant made the incriminating\nstatements. Id., at 399. Although it noted that the State\nhad conceded the issue, the Court nevertheless held that\nthe defendant’s right had clearly attached for the reason\nthat “[a] warrant had been issued for his arrest, he had\nbeen arraigned on that warrant before a judge in a . . .\ncourtroom, and he had been committed by the court to\nconfinement in jail.” Ibid.10\n——————\n  10 The dissent says that “Brewer’s attachment holding is indisputably\n\nno longer good law” because “we have subsequently held that the Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel is ‘ “offense specific,” ’ ” post, at 13 (opinion\nof THOMAS, J.) (quoting Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162, 164 (2001)), i.e.,\nthat it does not “exten[d] to crimes that are ‘factually related’ to those\nthat have actually been charged,” Cobb, supra, at 167. It is true that\nBrewer appears to have assumed that attachment of the right with\nrespect to the abduction charge should prompt attachment for the\nmurder charge as well. But the accuracy of the dissent’s assertion ends\nthere, for nothing in Cobb’s conclusion that the right is offense specific\ncasts doubt on Brewer’s separate, emphatic holding that the initial\nappearance marks the point at which the right attaches. Nor does\nCobb reflect, as the dissent suggests, see post, at 14, a more general\ndisapproval of our opinion in Brewer. While Brewer failed even to\nacknowledge the issue of offense specificity, it spoke clearly and force-\nfully about attachment. Cobb merely declined to follow Brewer’s\n8                 ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   In Jackson, the Court was asked to revisit the question\nwhether the right to counsel attaches at the initial ap-\npearance, and we had no more trouble answering it the\nsecond time around. Jackson was actually two consoli-\ndated cases, and although the State conceded that respon-\ndent Jackson’s arraignment “represented the initiation of\nformal legal proceedings,” 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3, it argued\nthat the same was not true for respondent Bladel. In\nbriefing us, the State explained that “[i]n Michigan, any\nperson charged with a felony, after arrest, must be\nbrought before a Magistrate or District Court Judge with-\nout unnecessary delay for his initial arraignment.” Brief\nfor Petitioner in Michigan v. Bladel, O. T. 1985, No. 84–\n1539, p. 24. The State noted that “[w]hile [Bladel] had\nbeen arraigned . . . , there is also a second arraignment in\nMichigan procedure . . . , at which time defendant has his\nfirst opportunity to enter a plea in a court with jurisdic-\ntion to render a final decision in a felony case.” Id., at 25.\nThe State contended that only the latter proceeding, the\n“arraignment on the information or indictment,” Y.\nKamisar, W. LaFave, J. Israel, & N. King, Modern Crimi-\nnal Procedure 28 (9th ed. 1999) (emphasis deleted), should\ntrigger the Sixth Amendment right.11 “The defendant’s\n——————\nunmentioned assumption, and thus it lends no support to the dissent’s\nclaim that we should ignore what Brewer explicitly said.\n  11 The State continued to press this contention at oral argument. See\n\nTr. of Oral Arg. in Michigan v. Jackson, O. T. 1985, No. 84–1531 etc., p.\n4 (“[T]he Michigan Supreme Court held that if a defendant, while at his\ninitial appearance before a magistrate who has no jurisdiction to accept\na final plea in the case, whose only job is ministerial, in other words to\nadvise a defendant of the charge against him, set bond if bond is\nappropriate, and to advise him of his right to counsel and to get the\nadministrative process going if he’s indigent, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt said if the defendant asked for appointed counsel at that stage,\nthe police are forevermore precluded from initiating interrogation of\nthat defendant”); id., at 8 (“First of all, as a practical matter, at least in\nour courts, the police are rarely present for arraignment, for this type of\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

The conclusion was driven by\nthe same considerations the Court had endorsed in\nBrewer: by the time a defendant is brought before a judi-\ncial officer, is informed of a formally lodged accusation,\nand has restrictions imposed on his liberty in aid of the\nprosecution, the State’s relationship with the defendant\nhas become solidly adversarial. And that is just as true\nwhen the proceeding comes before the indictment (in the\ncase of the initial arraignment on a formal complaint) as\nwhen it comes after it (at an arraignment on an indict-\nment).13 See Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1, 8 (1970)\n——————\nan arraignment, for an initial appearance, I guess we should use the\nterminology. . . . The prosecutor is not there for initial appearance. We\nhave people brought through a tunnel. A court officer picks them up.\nThey take them down and the judge goes through this procedure. . . .\nThere is typically nobody from our side, if you will, there to see what’s\ngoing on”).\n  12 The preliminary examination is a preindictment stage at which the\n\ndefendant is allowed to test the prosecution’s evidence against him, and\nto try to dissuade the prosecutor from seeking an indictment. See\nColeman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1 (1970). In Texas, the defendant is\nnotified of his right to a preliminary hearing, which in Texas is called\nan “examining trial,” at the article 15.17 hearing. See Tex. Crim. Proc.\nCode Ann., Art. 15.17(a). The examining trial in Texas is optional only,\nand the defendant must affirmatively request it. See Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 25.\n  13 The County, in its brief to this Court, suggests that although\n\nBrewer and Jackson spoke of attachment at the initial appearance, the\ncases might actually have turned on some unmentioned fact. As to\n10               ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(plurality opinion) (right to counsel applies at preindict-\nment preliminary hearing at which the “sole purposes . . .\nare to determine whether there is sufficient evidence\nagainst the accused to warrant presenting his case to the\ngrand jury, and, if so, to fix bail if the offense is bailable”);\ncf. Owen v. State, 596 So. 2d 985, 989, n. 7 (Fla. 1992)\n(“The term ‘arraign’ simply means to be called before a\ncourt officer and charged with a crime”).\n                              B\n   Our latest look at the significance of the initial appear-\nance was McNeil, 501 U. S. 171, which is no help to the\nCounty. In McNeil the State had conceded that the right\nto counsel attached at the first appearance before a county\ncourt commissioner, who set bail and scheduled a prelimi-\nnary examination. See id., at 173; see also id., at 175 (“It\nis undisputed, and we accept for purposes of the present\ncase, that at the time petitioner provided the incriminat-\ning statements at issue, his Sixth Amendment right had\nattached . . .”). But we did more than just accept the\nconcession; we went on to reaffirm that “[t]he Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel attaches at the first formal\nproceeding against an accused,” and observed that “in\n——————\nBrewer, the County speculates that an information might have been\nfiled before the defendant’s initial appearance. See Brief for Respon-\ndent 34–36. But as Rothgery points out, the initial appearance in\nBrewer was made in municipal court, and a felony information could\nnot have been filed there. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 11. As to\nJackson, the County suggests that the Court might have viewed Michi-\ngan’s initial arraignment as a significant proceeding only because the\ndefendant could make a statement at that hearing, and because re-\nspondent Bladel did in fact purport to enter a plea of not guilty. See\nBrief for Respondent 36–37. But this attempt to explain Jackson as a\nnarrow holding is impossible to square with Jackson’s sweeping rejec-\ntion of the State’s claims. It is further undermined by the fact that the\nmagistrate judge in Bladel’s case, like the one in Texas’s article 15.17\nhearing, had no jurisdiction to accept a plea of guilty to a felony charge.\nSee Reply Brief for Petitioner 11–12.\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

Under this\nstandard of prosecutorial awareness, attachment depends\nnot on whether a first appearance has begun adversary\njudicial proceedings, but on whether the prosecutor had a\nhand in starting it. That standard is wrong.\n  Neither Brewer nor Jackson said a word about the\nprosecutor’s involvement as a relevant fact, much less a\ncontrolling one. Those cases left no room for the factual\nenquiry the Court of Appeals would require, and with good\nreason: an attachment rule that turned on determining\nthe moment of a prosecutor’s first involvement would be\n“wholly unworkable and impossible to administer,” Esco-\nbedo v.

Voloudakis, Texas A&M U., Public\nPolicy Research Inst., Evaluating the Impact of Direct\nElectronic Filing in Criminal Cases: Closing the Paper\nTrap 2–3 (2006), online at http://www.courts.state.tx.\nus/tfid/pdf/FinalReport7-12-06wackn.pdf (as visited June\n19, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file))).\n   It is not that the Court of Appeals believed that any\nsuch regime would be desirable, but it thought originally\nthat its rule was implied by this Court’s statement that\nthe right attaches when the government has “committed\nitself to prosecute.” Kirby, 406 U. S., at 689. The Court of\nAppeals reasoned that because “the decision not to prose-\ncute is the quintessential function of a prosecutor” under\nTexas law, 491 F. 3d, at 297 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), the State could not commit itself to prosecution\nuntil the prosecutor signaled that it had.\n   But what counts as a commitment to prosecute is an\nissue of federal law unaffected by allocations of power\namong state officials under a State’s law, cf. Moran, 475\nU. S., at 429, n. 3 (“[T]he type of circumstances that would\ngive rise to the right would certainly have a federal defini-\ntion”), and under the federal standard, an accusation filed\nwith a judicial officer is sufficiently formal, and the gov-\nernment’s commitment to prosecute it sufficiently con-\ncrete, when the accusation prompts arraignment and\nrestrictions on the accused’s liberty to facilitate the prose-\ncution, see Jackson, 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3; Brewer, 430\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 399; Kirby, supra, at 689; see also n. 9, supra.\nFrom that point on, the defendant is “faced with the\nprosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in\nthe intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law”\nthat define his capacity and control his actual ability to\ndefend himself against a formal accusation that he is a\ncriminal. Kirby, supra, at 689. By that point, it is too late\nto wonder whether he is “accused” within the meaning of\nthe Sixth Amendment, and it makes no practical sense to\ndeny it. See Grano, Rhode Island v. Innis: A Need to\nReconsider the Constitutional Premises Underlying the\nLaw of Confessions, 17 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1, 31 (1979)\n(“[I]t would defy common sense to say that a criminal\nprosecution has not commenced against a defendant who,\nperhaps incarcerated and unable to afford judicially im-\nposed bail, awaits preliminary examination on the author-\nity of a charging document filed by the prosecutor, less\ntypically by the police, and approved by a court of law”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). All of this is equally\ntrue whether the machinery of prosecution was turned on\nby the local police or the state attorney general. In this\ncase, for example, Rothgery alleges that after the initial\nappearance, he was “unable to find any employment for\nwages” because “all of the potential employers he con-\ntacted knew or learned of the criminal charge pending\nagainst him.” Original Complaint in No. 1:04–CV–00456–\nLY (WD Tex., July 15, 2004), p. 5. One may assume that\nthose potential employers would still have declined to\nmake job offers if advised that the county prosecutor had\nnot filed the complaint.\n                              2\n  The County resists this logic with the argument that in\nconsidering the significance of the initial appearance, we\nmust ignore prejudice to a defendant’s pretrial liberty,\nreasoning that it is the concern, not of the right to counsel,\n16            ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut of the speedy-trial right and the Fourth Amendment.\nSee Brief for Respondent 47–51. And it cites Gouveia, 467\nU. S. 180, in support of its contention. See Brief for Re-\nspondent 49; see also Brief for Texas et al. as Amici Curiae\n8–9. We think the County’s reliance on Gouveia is mis-\nplaced, and its argument mistaken.\n   The defendants in Gouveia were prison inmates, sus-\npected of murder, who had been placed in an administra-\ntive detention unit and denied counsel up until an indict-\nment was filed. Although no formal judicial proceedings\nhad taken place prior to the indictment, see 467 U. S., at\n185, the defendants argued that their administrative\ndetention should be treated as an accusation for purposes\nof the right to counsel because the government was ac-\ntively investigating the crimes. We recognized that “be-\ncause an inmate suspected of a crime is already in prison,\nthe prosecution may have little incentive promptly to\nbring formal charges against him, and that the resulting\npreindictment delay may be particularly prejudicial to the\ninmate,” id., at 192, but we noted that statutes of limita-\ntion and protections of the Fifth Amendment guarded\nagainst delay, and that there was no basis for “depart[ing]\nfrom our traditional interpretation of the Sixth Amend-\nment right to counsel in order to provide additional protec-\ntions for [the inmates],” ibid.\n   Gouveia’s holding that the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel had not attached has no application here. For one\nthing, Gouveia does not affect the conclusion we reaf-\nfirmed two years later in Jackson, that bringing a defen-\ndant before a court for initial appearance signals a suffi-\ncient commitment to prosecute and marks the start of\nadversary judicial proceedings. (Indeed, Jackson refutes\nthe County’s argument that Fifth Amendment protections\nat the early stage obviate attachment of the Sixth Amend-\nment right at initial appearance. See supra, at 8–9.) And\nsince we are not asked to extend the right to counsel to a\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npoint earlier than formal judicial proceedings (as in Gou-\nveia), but to defer it to those proceedings in which a prose-\ncutor is involved, Gouveia does not speak to the question\nbefore us.\n  The County also tries to downplay the significance of the\ninitial appearance by saying that an attachment rule\nunqualified by prosecutorial involvement would lead to the\nconclusion “that the State has statutorily committed to\nprosecute every suspect arrested by the police,” given that\n“state law requires [an article 15.17 hearing] for every\narrestee.” Brief for Respondent 24 (emphasis in original).\nThe answer, though, is that the State has done just that,\nsubject to the option to change its official mind later. The\nState may rethink its commitment at any point: it may\nchoose not to seek indictment in a felony case, say, or the\nprosecutor may enter nolle prosequi after the case gets to\nthe jury room. But without a change of position, a defen-\ndant subject to accusation after initial appearance is\nheaded for trial and needs to get a lawyer working,\nwhether to attempt to avoid that trial or to be ready with\na defense when the trial date arrives.\n                              3\n    A third tack on the County’s part, slightly different from\nthe one taken by the Fifth Circuit, gets it no further. The\nCounty stipulates that “the properly formulated test is not\n. . . merely whether prosecutors have had any involvement\nin the case whatsoever, but instead whether the State has\nobjectively committed itself to prosecute.” Id., at 31. It\nthen informs us that “[p]rosecutorial involvement is\nmerely one form of evidence of such commitment.” Ibid.\nOther sufficient evidentiary indications are variously\ndescribed: first (expansively) as “the filing of formal\ncharges . . . by information, indictment or formal com-\nplaint, or the holding of an adversarial preliminary hear-\ning to determine probable cause to file such charges,” ibid.\n18            ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(citing Kirby, 406 U. S., at 689); then (restrictively) as a\ncourt appearance following “arrest . . . on an indictment or\ninformation,” Brief for Respondent 32. Either version, in\nany event, runs up against Brewer and Jackson: an initial\nappearance following a charge signifies a sufficient com-\nmitment to prosecute regardless of a prosecutor’s partici-\npation, indictment, information, or what the County calls\na “formal” complaint.\n   So the County is reduced to taking aim at those cases.\nBrewer and Jackson, we are told, are “vague” and thus of\n“limited, if any, precedential value.” Brief for Respondent\n33, 35; see also id., at 32, n. 13 (asserting that Brewer and\nJackson “neither provide nor apply an analytical frame-\nwork for determining attachment”). And, according to the\nCounty, our cases (Brewer and Jackson aside) actually\nestablish a “general rule that the right to counsel attaches\nat the point that [what the County calls] formal charges\nare filed,” Brief for Respondent 19, with exceptions al-\nlowed only in the case of “a very limited set of specific\npreindictment situations,” id., at 23. The County suggests\nthat the latter category should be limited to those appear-\nances at which the aid of counsel is urgent and “ ‘the dan-\ngers to the accused of proceeding without counsel’ ” are\ngreat. Id., at 28 (quoting Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S.\n285, 298 (1988)). Texas’s article 15.17 hearing should not\ncount as one of those situations, the County says, because\nit is not of critical significance, since it “allows no presen-\ntation of witness testimony and provides no opportunity to\nexpose weaknesses in the government’s evidence, create a\nbasis for later impeachment, or even engage in basic dis-\ncovery.” Brief for Respondent 29.\n   We think the County is wrong both about the clarity of\nour cases and the substance that we find clear. Certainly\nit is true that the Court in Brewer and Jackson saw no\nneed for lengthy disquisitions on the significance of the\ninitial appearance, but that was because it found the\n                     Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                   19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nattachment issue an easy one. The Court’s conclusions\nwere not vague; Brewer expressed “no doubt” that the\nright to counsel attached at the initial appearance, 430\nU. S., at 399, and Jackson said that the opposite result\nwould be “untenable,” 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3.\n  If, indeed, the County had simply taken the cases at face\nvalue, it would have avoided the mistake of merging the\nattachment question (whether formal judicial proceedings\nhave begun) with the distinct “critical stage” question\n(whether counsel must be present at a postattachment\nproceeding unless the right to assistance is validly\nwaived). Attachment occurs when the government has\nused the judicial machinery to signal a commitment to\nprosecute as spelled out in Brewer and Jackson. Once\nattachment occurs, the accused at least15 is entitled to the\npresence of appointed counsel during any “critical stage” of\nthe postattachment proceedings; what makes a stage\ncritical is what shows the need for counsel’s presence.16\nThus, counsel must be appointed within a reasonable time\nafter attachment to allow for adequate representation at\nany critical stage before trial, as well as at trial itself.\n  The County thus makes an analytical mistake in its\nassumption that attachment necessarily requires the\noccurrence or imminence of a critical stage. See Brief for\nRespondent 28–30. On the contrary, it is irrelevant to\nattachment that the presence of counsel at an article 15.17\n——————\n  15 We do not here purport to set out the scope of an individual’s post-\nattachment right to the presence of counsel. It is enough for present\npurposes to highlight that the enquiry into that right is a different one\nfrom the attachment analysis.\n  16 The cases have defined critical stages as proceedings between an\n\nindividual and agents of the State (whether “formal or informal, in\ncourt or out,” see United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967)) that\namount to “trial-like confrontations,” at which counsel would help the\naccused “in coping with legal problems or . . . meeting his adversary,”\nUnited States v. Ash, 413 U. S. 300, 312–313 (1973); see also Massiah v.\nUnited States, 377 U. S. 201 (1964).\n20              ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhearing, say, may not be critical, just as it is irrelevant\nthat counsel’s presence may not be critical when a prose-\ncutor walks over to the trial court to file an information.\nAs we said in Jackson, “[t]he question whether arraign-\nment signals the initiation of adversary judicial proceed-\nings . . . is distinct from the question whether the ar-\nraignment itself is a critical stage requiring the presence\nof counsel.” 475 U. S., at 630, n. 3. Texas’s article 15.17\nhearing plainly signals attachment, even if it is not itself a\ncritical stage.17\n                            III\n   Our holding is narrow. We do not decide whether the 6-\nmonth delay in appointment of counsel resulted in preju-\ndice to Rothgery’s Sixth Amendment rights, and have no\noccasion to consider what standards should apply in decid-\ning this. We merely reaffirm what we have held before\nand what an overwhelming majority of American jurisdic-\ntions understand in practice: a criminal defendant’s initial\nappearance before a judicial officer, where he learns the\ncharge against him and his liberty is subject to restriction,\nmarks the start of adversary judicial proceedings that\ntrigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to coun-\nsel. Because the Fifth Circuit came to a different conclu-\nsion on this threshold issue, its judgment is vacated, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  17 The dissent likewise anticipates an issue distinct from attachment\n\nwhen it claims Rothgery has suffered no harm the Sixth Amendment\nrecognizes. Post, at 18. Whether the right has been violated and\nwhether Rothgery has suffered cognizable harm are separate questions\nfrom when the right attaches, the sole question before us.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

GILLESPIE\n               COUNTY, TEXAS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                         [June 23, 2008]\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and\nJUSTICE SCALIA join, concurring.\n   I join the Court’s opinion because I do not understand it\nto hold that a defendant is entitled to the assistance of\nappointed counsel as soon as his Sixth Amendment right\nattaches. As I interpret our precedents, the term “attach-\nment” signifies nothing more than the beginning of the\ndefendant’s prosecution. It does not mark the beginning of\na substantive entitlement to the assistance of counsel. I\nwrite separately to elaborate on my understanding of the\nterm “attachment” and its relationship to the Amend-\nment’s substantive guarantee of “the Assistance of Coun-\nsel for [the] defence.”\n   The Sixth Amendment provides in pertinent part that\n“[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the\nright . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his de-\nfence.” The Amendment thus defines the scope of the\nright to counsel in three ways: It provides who may assert\nthe right (“the accused”); when the right may be asserted\n(“[i]n all criminal prosecutions”); and what the right guar-\nantees (“the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for\nhis defence”).\n   It is in the context of interpreting the Amendment’s\nanswer to the second of these questions—when the right\nmay be asserted—that we have spoken of the right “at-\n2             ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\ntaching.” In Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, 688 (1972), a\nplurality of the Court explained that “a person’s Sixth and\nFourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at\nor after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have\nbeen initiated against him.” A majority of the Court\nelaborated on that explanation in Moore v. Illinois, 434\nU. S. 220 (1977):\n       “In Kirby v. Illinois, the plurality opinion made\n    clear that the right to counsel announced in Wade and\n    Gilbert attaches only to corporeal identifications con-\n    ducted at or after the initiation of adversary judicial\n    criminal proceedings—whether by way of formal\n    charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information,\n    or arraignment. This is so because the initiation of\n    such proceedings marks the commencement of the\n    ‘criminal prosecutions’ to which alone the explicit\n    guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable.\n    Thus, in Kirby the plurality held that the prosecu-\n    tion’s evidence of a robbery victim’s one-on-one sta-\n    tionhouse identification of an uncounseled suspect\n    shortly after the suspect’s arrest was admissible be-\n    cause adversary judicial criminal proceedings had not\n    yet been initiated.” Id., at 226–227 (internal quota-\n    tion marks and citations omitted).\nWhen we wrote in Kirby and Moore that the Sixth\nAmendment right had “attached,” we evidently meant\nnothing more than that a “criminal prosecutio[n]” had\nbegun. Our cases have generally used the term in that\nnarrow fashion. See Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162, 167\n(2001) (internal quotation marks omitted); McNeil v.\nWisconsin, 501 U.

S. 454, 469 (1981) (“[W]e have held that the right to\ncounsel granted by the Sixth Amendment means that a\nperson is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the\ntime that adversary judicial proceedings have been initi-\nated against him . . .” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nBrewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387, 398 (1977) (“[T]he right\nto counsel granted by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments means at least that a person is entitled to the help\nof a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings\nhave been initiated against him . . .”).\n   Because pretrial criminal procedures vary substantially\nfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction, there is room for dis-\nagreement about when a “prosecution” begins for Sixth\nAmendment purposes. As the Court, notes, however, we\nhave previously held that “arraignments” that were func-\ntionally indistinguishable from the Texas magistration\nmarked the point at which the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel “attached.” See ante, at 6 (discussing Jackson,\nsupra, and Brewer, supra).\n   It does not follow, however, and I do not understand the\nCourt to hold, that the county had an obligation to appoint\nan attorney to represent petitioner within some specified\nperiod after his magistration. To so hold, the Court would\nneed to do more than conclude that petitioner’s criminal\nprosecution had begun. It would also need to conclude\nthat the assistance of counsel in the wake of a Texas\nmagistration is part of the substantive guarantee of the\nSixth Amendment. That question lies beyond our reach,\npetitioner having never sought our review of it. See Pet.\nfor Cert. i (inviting us to decide whether the Fifth Circuit\n4             ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nerred in concluding “that adversary judicial proceedings\n. . . had not commenced, and petitioner’s Sixth Amend-\nment rights had not attached”). To recall the framework\nlaid out earlier, we have been asked to address only the\nwhen question, not the what question. Whereas the tem-\nporal scope of the right is defined by the words “[i]n all\ncriminal prosecutions,” the right’s substantive guarantee\nflows from a different textual font: the words “Assistance\nof Counsel for his defence.”\n    In interpreting this latter phrase, we have held that\n“defence” means defense at trial, not defense in relation to\nother objectives that may be important to the accused.\nSee Gouveia, supra, at 190 (“[T]he right to counsel exists\nto protect the accused during trial-type confrontations\nwith the prosecutor . . .”); Ash, supra, at 309 (“[T]he core\npurpose of the counsel guarantee was to assure ‘Assis-\ntance’ at trial . . .”). We have thus rejected the argument\nthat the Sixth Amendment entitles the criminal defendant\nto the assistance of appointed counsel at a probable cause\nhearing. See Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 122–123\n(1975) (observing that the Fourth Amendment hearing “is\naddressed only to pretrial custody” and has an insubstan-\ntial effect on the defendant’s trial rights). More generally,\nwe have rejected the notion that the right to counsel enti-\ntles the defendant to a “preindictment private investiga-\ntor.” Gouveia, supra, at 191.\n    At the same time, we have recognized that certain pre-\ntrial events may so prejudice the outcome of the defen-\ndant’s prosecution that, as a practical matter, the defen-\ndant must be represented at those events in order to enjoy\ngenuinely effective assistance at trial. See, e.g., Ash,\nsupra, at 309–310; United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218,\n226 (1967). Thus, we have held that an indigent defen-\ndant is entitled to the assistance of appointed counsel at a\npreliminary hearing if “substantial prejudice . . . inheres\nin the . . . confrontation” and “counsel [may] help avoid\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nthat prejudice.” Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1, 9\n(1970) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted); see also White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59, 60 (1963)\n(per curiam). We have also held that the assistance of\ncounsel is guaranteed at a pretrial lineup, since “the con-\nfrontation compelled by the State between the accused and\nthe victim or witnesses to a crime to elicit identification\nevidence is peculiarly riddled with innumerable dangers\nand variable factors which might seriously, even crucially,\nderogate from a fair trial.” Wade, supra, at 228. Other\n“critical stages” of the prosecution include pretrial interro-\ngation, a pretrial psychiatric exam, and certain kinds of\narraignments. See Harvey, 494 U. S., at 358, n. 4; Estelle,\nsupra, at 470–471; Coleman, supra, at 7–8 (plurality\nopinion).\n   Weaving together these strands of authority, I interpret\nthe Sixth Amendment to require the appointment of coun-\nsel only after the defendant’s prosecution has begun, and\nthen only as necessary to guarantee the defendant effec-\ntive assistance at trial. Cf. McNeil, 501 U. S., at 177–178\n(“The purpose of the Sixth Amendment counsel guaran-\ntee—and hence the purpose of invoking it—is to protec[t]\nthe unaided layman at critical confrontations with his\nexpert adversary, the government, after the adverse posi-\ntions of government and defendant have solidified with\nrespect to a particular alleged crime” (emphasis and al-\nteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted)). It\nfollows that defendants in Texas will not necessarily be\nentitled to the assistance of counsel within some specified\nperiod after their magistrations. See ante, at 19 (opinion\nof the Court) (pointing out the “analytical mistake” of\nassuming “that attachment necessarily requires the occur-\nrence or imminence of a critical stage”).

ROTHGERY, PETITIONER v. GILLESPIE\n               COUNTY, TEXAS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                        [June 23, 2008]\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.\n  The Court holds today—for the first time after plenary\nconsideration of the question—that a criminal prosecution\nbegins, and that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\ntherefore attaches, when an individual who has been\nplaced under arrest makes an initial appearance before a\nmagistrate for a probable-cause determination and the\nsetting of bail. Because the Court’s holding is not sup-\nported by the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment or\nany reasonable interpretation of our precedents, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n                              I\n   The Sixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have\nthe Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” The text of the\nSixth Amendment thus makes clear that the right to\ncounsel arises only upon initiation of a “criminal prosecu-\ntio[n].” For that reason, the Court has repeatedly stressed\nthat the Sixth Amendment right to counsel “does not\nattach until a prosecution is commenced.” McNeil v.\nWisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 175 (1991); see also United\nStates v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180, 188 (1984) (“[T]he literal\nlanguage of the Amendment . . . requires the existence of\nboth a ‘criminal prosecutio[n]’ and an ‘accused’ ”). Echoing\n2             ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthis refrain, the Court today reiterates that “[t]he Sixth\nAmendment right of the ‘accused’ to assistance of counsel\nin ‘all criminal prosecutions’ is limited by its terms.” Ante,\nat 5 (footnote omitted).\n  Given the Court’s repeated insistence that the right to\ncounsel is textually limited to “criminal prosecutions,” one\nwould expect the Court’s jurisprudence in this area to be\ngrounded in an understanding of what those words meant\nwhen the Sixth Amendment was adopted. Inexplicably,\nhowever, neither today’s decision nor any of the other\nnumerous decisions in which the Court has construed the\nright to counsel has attempted to discern the original\nmeaning of “criminal prosecutio[n].” I think it appropriate\nto examine what a “criminal prosecutio[n]” would have\nbeen understood to entail by those who adopted the Sixth\nAmendment.\n                             A\n  There is no better place to begin than with Blackstone,\n“whose works constituted the preeminent authority on\nEnglish law for the founding generation.” Alden v. Maine,\n527 U. S. 706, 715 (1999). Blackstone devoted more than\n100 pages of his Commentaries on the Laws of England to\na discussion of the “regular and ordinary method of pro-\nceeding in the courts of criminal jurisdiction.” 4 W. Black-\nstone, Commentaries *289 (hereinafter Blackstone).\n  At the outset of his discussion, Blackstone organized the\nvarious stages of a criminal proceeding “under twelve\ngeneral heads, following each other in a progressive or-\nder.” Ibid. The first six relate to pretrial events: “1. Ar-\nrest; 2. Commitment and bail; 3. Prosecution; 4. Process; 5.\nArraignment, and it’s incidents; 6. Plea, and issue.” Ibid.\n(emphasis added). Thus, the first significant fact is that\nBlackstone did not describe the entire criminal process as\na “prosecution,” but rather listed prosecution as the third\nstep in a list of successive stages. For a more complete\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nunderstanding of what Blackstone meant by “prosecution,”\nhowever, we must turn to chapter 23, entitled “Of the\nSeveral Modes of Prosecution.” Id., at *301. There, Black-\nstone explained that—after arrest and examination by a\njustice of the peace to determine whether a suspect should\nbe discharged, committed to prison, or admitted to bail,\nid., at *296—the “next step towards the punishment of\noffenders is their prosecution, or the manner of their for-\nmal accusation,” id., at *301 (emphasis added).\n   Blackstone thus provides a definition of “prosecution”:\nthe manner of an offender’s “formal accusation.” The\nmodifier “formal” is significant because it distinguishes\n“prosecution” from earlier stages of the process involving a\ndifferent kind of accusation: the allegation of criminal\nconduct necessary to justify arrest and detention. Black-\nstone’s discussion of arrest, commitment, and bail makes\nclear that a person could not be arrested and detained\nwithout a “charge” or “accusation,” i.e., an allegation,\nsupported by probable cause, that the person had commit-\nted a crime. See id., at *289–*300. But the accusation\njustifying arrest and detention was clearly preliminary to\nthe “formal accusation” that Blackstone identified with\n“prosecution.” See id., at *290, *318.\n   By “formal accusation,” Blackstone meant, in most\ncases, “indictment, the most usual and effectual means of\nprosecution.” Id., at *302. Blackstone defined an “indict-\nment” as “a written accusation of one or more persons of a\ncrime or misdemeanor, preferred to, and presented upon\noath by, a grand jury.” Ibid. (emphasis deleted). If the\ngrand jury was “satisfied of the truth of the accusation,” it\nendorsed the indictment, id., at *305–*306, which was\nthen “publicly delivered into court,” id., at *306, “after-\nwards to be tried and determined,” id., at *303, “before an\nofficer having power to punish the [charged] offence,” 2 T.\nCunningham, A New and Complete Law Dictionary (2d ed.\n1771).\n4             ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   In addition to indictment, Blackstone identified two\nother “methods of prosecution at the suit of the king.” 4\nBlackstone *312. The first was presentment, which, like\nan indictment, was a grand jury’s formal accusation “of an\noffence, inquirable in the Court where it [was] presented.”\n5 G. Jacob, The Law-Dictionary 278–279 (1811). The\nprincipal difference was that the accusation arose from\n“the notice taken by a grand jury of any offence from their\nown knowledge or observation” rather than from a “bill of\nindictment laid before them.” 4 Blackstone *301. The\nsecond was information, “the only species of proceeding at\nthe suit of the king, without a previous indictment or\npresentment by a grand jury.” Id., at *308. After an\ninformation was filed, it was “tried,” id., at *309, in the\nsame way as an indictment: “The same notice was given,\nthe same process was issued, the same pleas were allowed,\nthe same trial by jury was had, the same judgment was\ngiven by the same judges, as if the prosecution had origi-\nnally been by indictment,” id., at *310.\n   From the foregoing, the basic elements of a criminal\n“prosecution” emerge with reasonable clarity. “Prosecu-\ntion,” as Blackstone used the term, referred to “instituting\na criminal suit,” id., at *309, by filing a formal charging\ndocument—an indictment, presentment, or information—\nupon which the defendant was to be tried in a court with\npower to punish the alleged offense. And, significantly,\nBlackstone’s usage appears to have accorded with the\nordinary meaning of the term. See 2 N. Webster, An\nAmerican Dictionary of the English Language (1828)\n(defining “prosecution” as “[t]he institution or commence-\nment and continuance of a criminal suit; the process of\nexhibiting formal charges against an offender before a\nlegal tribunal, and pursuing them to final judgment,” and\nnoting that “[p]rosecutions may be by presentment, infor-\nmation or indictment”).\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)              5\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                               B\n  With Blackstone as our guide, it is significant that the\nFramers used the words “criminal prosecutions” in the\nSixth Amendment rather than some other formulation\nsuch as “criminal proceedings” or “criminal cases.” In-\ndeed, elsewhere in the Bill of Rights we find just such an\nalternative formulation: In contrast to the Sixth Amend-\nment, the Fifth Amendment refers to “criminal case[s].”\nU. S. Const., Amdt. 5 (“No person . . . shall be compelled in\nany criminal case to be a witness against himself”).\n  In Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547 (1892), the\nCourt indicated that the difference in phraseology was not\naccidental. There the Court held that the Fifth Amend-\nment right not to be compelled to be a witness against\noneself “in any criminal case” could be invoked by a wit-\nness testifying before a grand jury. The Court rejected the\nargument that there could be no “criminal case” prior to\nindictment, reasoning that a “criminal case” under the\nFifth Amendment is much broader than a “criminal prose-\ncutio[n]” under the Sixth Amendment. Id., at 563.\n  The following Term, the Court construed the phrase\n“criminal prosecution” in a statutory context, and this\ntime the Court squarely held that a “prosecution” does not\nencompass preindictment stages of the criminal process.\nIn Virginia v. Paul, 148 U. S. 107 (1893), the Court con-\nsidered Revised Statute §643, which authorized removal to\nfederal court of any “ ‘criminal prosecution’ ” “ ‘commenced\nin any court of a State’ ” against a federal officer. Id., at\n115. The respondent, a deputy marshal, had been ar-\nrested by Virginia authorities on a warrant for murder\nand was held in county jail awaiting his appearance before\na justice of the peace “with a view to a commitment to\nawait the action of the grand jury.” Id., at 118. He filed a\npetition for removal of “ ‘said cause’ ” to federal court. Ibid.\nThe question before the Court was whether a “ ‘criminal\nprosecution’ ” had “ ‘commenced’ ” within the meaning of\n6             ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe statute at the time the respondent filed his removal\npetition.\n   The Court held that a criminal prosecution had not com-\nmenced, and that removal was therefore not authorized by\nthe terms of the statute. The Court noted that under Vir-\nginia law murder could be prosecuted only “by indictment\nfound in the county court,” and that “a justice of the peace,\nupon a previous complaint, [could] do no more than to\nexamine whether there [was] good cause for believing that\nthe accused [was] guilty, and to commit him for trial before\nthe court having jurisdiction of the offence.” Ibid. Accord-\ningly, where “no indictment was found, or other action\ntaken, in the county court,” there was as yet no “ ‘criminal\nprosecution.’ ” Id., at 119. The appearance before the jus-\ntice of the peace did not qualify as a “prosecution”:\n    “Proceedings before a magistrate to commit a person\n    to jail, or to hold him to bail, in order to secure his ap-\n    pearance to answer for a crime or offence which the\n    magistrate has no jurisdiction himself to try, before\n    the court in which he may be prosecuted and tried,\n    are but preliminary to the prosecution, and are no\n    more a commencement of the prosecution, than is an\n    arrest by an officer without a warrant for a felony\n    committed in his presence.” Ibid.\n                             C\n   The foregoing historical summary is strong evidence\nthat the term “criminal prosecutio[n]” in the Sixth\nAmendment refers to the commencement of a criminal suit\nby filing formal charges in a court with jurisdiction to try\nand punish the defendant. And on this understanding of\nthe Sixth Amendment, it is clear that petitioner’s initial\nappearance before the magistrate did not commence a\n“criminal prosecutio[n].” No formal charges had been\nfiled. The only document submitted to the magistrate was\nthe arresting officer’s affidavit of probable cause. The\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nofficer stated that he “ha[d] good reason to believe” that\npetitioner was a felon and had been “walking around [an]\nRV park with a gun belt on, carrying a pistol, handcuffs,\nmace spray, extra bullets and a knife.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 33a. The officer therefore “charge[d]” that petitioner\nhad “commit[ted] the offense of unlawful possession of a\nfirearm by a felon—3rd degree felony.” Ibid. The magis-\ntrate certified that he had examined the affidavit and\n“determined that probable cause existed for the arrest of\nthe individual accused therein.” Id., at 34a. Later that\nday, petitioner was released on bail, and did not hear from\nthe State again until he was indicted six months later.\n   The affidavit of probable cause clearly was not the type\nof formal accusation Blackstone identified with the com-\nmencement of a criminal “prosecution.” Rather, it was the\npreliminary accusation necessary to justify arrest and\ndetention—stages of the criminal process that Blackstone\nplaced before prosecution. The affidavit was not a plead-\ning that instituted a criminal prosecution, such as an\nindictment, presentment, or information; and the magis-\ntrate to whom it was presented had no jurisdiction to try\nand convict petitioner for the felony offense charged\ntherein. See Teal v. State, 230 S. W. 3d 172, 174 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2007) (“The Texas Constitution requires that,\nunless waived by the defendant, the State must obtain a\ngrand jury indictment in a felony case”); Tex. Crim. Proc.\nCode Ann., Arts. 4.05, 4.11(a) (West 2005). That is most\nassuredly why the magistrate informed petitioner that\ncharges “will be filed” in district court. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 35a (emphasis added).\n   The original meaning of the Sixth Amendment, then,\ncuts decisively against the Court’s conclusion that peti-\ntioner’s right to counsel attached at his initial appearance\nbefore the magistrate. But we are not writing on a blank\nslate: This Court has a substantial body of more recent\nprecedent construing the Sixth Amendment right to coun-\n8               ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsel.\n                             II\n   As the Court notes, our cases have “pegged commence-\nment” of a criminal prosecution, ante, at 5, to “the initia-\ntion of adversary judicial criminal proceedings—whether\nby way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment,\ninformation, or arraignment,” Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S.\n682, 689 (1972) (plurality opinion). The Court has re-\npeated this formulation in virtually every right-to-counsel\ncase decided since Kirby. Because Kirby’s formulation of\nthe attachment test has been accorded such precedential\nsignificance, it is important to determine precisely what\nKirby said:\n          “In a line of constitutional cases in this Court stem-\n       ming back to the Court’s landmark opinion in Powell\n       v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 [(1932)], it has been firmly\n       established that a person’s Sixth and Fourteenth\n       Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after\n       the time that adversary judicial proceedings have\n       been initiated against him. See Powell v. Alabama,\n       supra; Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 [(1938)]; Ham-\n       ilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 [(1961)]; Gideon v.\n       Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 [(1963)]; White v. Mary-\n       land, 373 U. S. 59 [(1963) (per curiam)]; Massiah v.\n       United States, 377 U. S. 201 [(1964)]; United States v.\n       Wade, 388 U. S. 218 [(1967)]; Gilbert v. California,\n       388 U. S. 263 [(1967)]; Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S.\n       1 [(1970)].\n          “This is not to say that a defendant in a criminal\n       case has a constitutional right to counsel only at the\n       trial itself. The Powell case makes clear that the right\n       attaches at the time of arraignment, and the Court\n       has recently held that it exists also at the time of a\n       preliminary hearing. Coleman v. Alabama, supra.\n       But the point is that, while members of the Court\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n    have differed as to existence of the right to counsel in\n    the contexts of some of the above cases, all of those\n    cases have involved points of time at or after the ini-\n    tiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings—\n    whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hear-\n    ing, indictment, information, or arraignment.” Id., at\n    688–689 (footnote omitted).\n   It is noteworthy that Kirby did not purport to announce\nanything new; rather, it simply catalogued what the Court\nhad previously held. And the point of the plurality’s dis-\ncussion was that the criminal process contains stages\nprior to commencement of a criminal prosecution. The\nholding of the case was that the right to counsel did not\napply at a station house lineup that took place “before the\ndefendant had been indicted or otherwise formally charged\nwith any criminal offense.” Id., at 684.\n   Kirby gave five examples of events that initiate “adver-\nsary judicial criminal proceedings”: formal charge, pre-\nliminary hearing, indictment, information, and arraign-\nment. None of these supports the result the Court reaches\ntoday. I will apply them seriatim. No indictment or in-\nformation had been filed when petitioner appeared before\nthe magistrate. Nor was there any other formal charge.\nAlthough the plurality in Kirby did not define “formal\ncharge,” there is no reason to believe it would have in-\ncluded an affidavit of probable cause in that category.\nNone of the cases on which it relied stood for that proposi-\ntion. Indeed, all of them—with the exception of White v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 59 (1963) (per curiam), and Coleman\nv. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1 (1970)—involved postindictment\nproceedings. See Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 49\n(1932) (postindictment arraignment); Johnson v. Zerbst,\n304 U. S. 458, 460 (1938) (trial); Hamilton v. Alabama,\n368 U. S. 52, 53, n. 3 (1961) (postindictment arraignment);\nGideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 337 (1963) (trial);\n10            ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nMassiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 (1964) (postin-\ndictment interrogation); United States v. Wade, 388 U. S.\n218, 219–220 (1967) (postindictment lineup); Gilbert v.\nCalifornia, 388 U. S. 263, 269 (1967) (postindictment\nlineup).\n   Nor was petitioner’s initial appearance a preliminary\nhearing. The comparable proceeding in Texas is called an\n“examining trial.” See ante, at 9, n. 12. More importantly,\npetitioner’s initial appearance was unlike the preliminary\nhearings that were held to constitute “critical stages” in\nWhite and Coleman, because it did not involve entry of a\nplea, cf. White, supra, at 60, and was nonadversarial, cf.\nColeman, supra, at 9. There was no prosecutor present,\nthere were no witnesses to cross-examine, there was no\ncase to discover, and the result of the proceeding was not\nto bind petitioner over to the grand jury or the trial court.\n   Finally, petitioner’s initial appearance was not what\nKirby described as an “arraignment.” An arraignment, in\nits traditional and usual sense, is a postindictment pro-\nceeding at which the defendant enters a plea. See, e.g.,\nW. LaFave, J. Israel, & N. King, Criminal Procedure\n§1.3(n), p. 19 (4th ed. 2004); 4 Blackstone *322. Although\nthe word “arraignment” is sometimes used to describe an\ninitial appearance before a magistrate, see LaFave, supra,\n§1.3(j), at 16, that is not what Kirby meant when it said\nthat the right to counsel attaches at an “arraignment.”\nRather, it meant the traditional, postindictment arraign-\nment where the defendant enters a plea. This would be\nthe most reasonable assumption even if there were noth-\ning else to go on, since that is the primary meaning of the\nword, especially when used unmodified.\n   But there is no need to assume. Kirby purported to\ndescribe only what the Court had already held, and none\nof the cases Kirby cited involved an initial appearance.\nOnly two of the cases involved arraignments, and both\nwere postindictment arraignments at which the defendant\n                    Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                  11\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nentered a plea. Hamilton, supra, at 53, n. 3; Powell, 287\nU. S., at 49. And the considerations that drove the Court’s\nanalysis in those cases are not present here. See id., at 57\n(emphasizing that “from the time of their arraignment\nuntil the beginning of their trial, when consultation, thor-\noughgoing investigation and preparation were vitally\nimportant, the defendants did not have the aid of coun-\nsel”); Hamilton, supra, at 53–55 (emphasizing that the\ndefendant entered a plea and was required to raise or\nwaive certain defenses). Kirby’s inclusion of “arraign-\nment” in the list of adversary judicial proceedings that\ntrigger the right to counsel thus provides no support for\nthe view that the right to counsel attaches at an initial\nappearance before a magistrate.\n                            III\n   It is clear that when Kirby was decided in 1972 there\nwas no precedent in this Court for the conclusion that a\ncriminal prosecution begins, and the right to counsel\ntherefore attaches, at an initial appearance before a mag-\nistrate. The Court concludes, however, that two subse-\nquent decisions—Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387 (1977),\nand Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986)—stand for\nthat proposition. Those decisions, which relied almost\nexclusively on Kirby, cannot bear the weight the Court\nputs on them.1\n   In Brewer, the defendant challenged his conviction for\nmurdering a 10-year-old girl on the ground that his Sixth\n——————\n  1 The Court also relies on McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171 (1991),\n\nto support its assertion that the right to counsel attaches upon an\ninitial appearance before a magistrate. Ante, at 10–11. But in McNeil,\nthe Court expressed no view whatsoever on the attachment issue.\nRather, it noted that the issue was “undisputed,” and “accept[ed] for\npurposes of the present case, that . . . [the defendant’s] Sixth Amend-\nment right had attached.” 501 U. S., at 175. We do not ordinarily give\nweight to assumptions made in prior cases about matters that were not\nin dispute.\n12            ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nAmendment right to counsel had been violated when\ndetectives elicited incriminating statements from him\nwhile transporting him from Davenport, Iowa, where he\nhad been arrested on a warrant for abduction and “ar-\nraigned before a judge . . . on the outstanding arrest war-\nrant,” to Des Moines, where he was to be tried. 430 U. S.,\nat 390–391. The principal issue was whether the defen-\ndant had waived his right to have counsel present during\npolice questioning when he voluntarily engaged one of the\ndetectives in a “wide-ranging conversation.” Id., at 392.\nHe subsequently agreed to lead the detectives to the girl’s\nbody in response to the so-called “ ‘Christian burial\nspeech,’ ” in which one of the detectives told the defendant\nthat “ ‘the parents of this little girl should be entitled to a\nChristian burial for the little girl who was snatched away\nfrom them on Christmas [E]ve and murdered.’ ” Id., at\n392–393. Not surprisingly, the parties vigorously disputed\nthe waiver issue, and it sharply divided the Court.\n   In contrast, the question whether the defendant’s right\nto counsel had attached was neither raised in the courts\nbelow nor disputed before this Court. Nonetheless, the\nCourt, after quoting Kirby’s formulation of the test, offered\nits conclusory observations:\n       “There can be no doubt in the present case that ju-\n     dicial proceedings had been initiated against Williams\n     before the start of the automobile ride from Davenport\n     to Des Moines. A warrant had been issued for his ar-\n     rest, he had been arraigned on that warrant before a\n     judge in a Davenport courtroom, and he had been\n     committed by the court to confinement in jail. The\n     State does not contend otherwise.” 430 U. S., at 399.\n    Brewer’s cursory treatment of the attachment issue\ndemonstrates precisely why, when “an issue [is] not ad-\ndressed by the parties,” it is “imprudent of us to address it\n. . . with any pretense of settling it for all time.” Metro-\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

S. 121, 136 (1997).\nAs an initial matter, the Court’s discussion of the facts\nreveals little about what happened at the proceeding.\nThere is no indication, for example, whether it was adver-\nsarial or whether the defendant was required to enter a\nplea or raise or waive any defenses—facts that earlier\ncases such as Hamilton, White, and Coleman had found\nsignificant.\n   Even assuming, however, that the arraignment in\nBrewer was functionally identical to the initial appearance\nhere, Brewer offered no reasoning for its conclusion that\nthe right to counsel attached at such a proceeding. One is\nleft with the distinct impression that the Court simply saw\nthe word “arraignment” in Kirby’s attachment test and\nconcluded that the right must have attached because the\ndefendant had been “arraigned.” There is no indication\nthat Brewer considered the difference between an ar-\nraignment on a warrant and an arraignment at which the\ndefendant pleads to the indictment.\n   The Court finds it significant that Brewer expressed “ ‘no\ndoubt’ ” that the right had attached. Ante, at 19 (quoting\n430 U. S., at 399). There was no need for a “lengthy dis-\nquisitio[n],” the Court says, because Brewer purportedly\n“found the attachment issue an easy one.” Ante, at 18–19.\nWhat the Court neglects to mention is that Brewer’s at-\ntachment holding is indisputably no longer good law. That\nis because we have subsequently held that the Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel is “offense specific,” meaning\nthat it attaches only to those offenses for which the defen-\ndant has been formally charged, and not to “other offenses\n‘closely related factually’ to the charged offense.” Texas v.\nCobb, 532 U. S. 162, 164 (2001). Because the defendant in\nBrewer had been arraigned only on the abduction warrant,\nthere is no doubt that, under Cobb, his right to counsel\nhad not yet attached with respect to the murder charges\nthat were subsequently brought. See 532 U. S., at 184\n14            ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(BREYER, J., dissenting) (noting that under the majority’s\nrule, “[the defendant’s] murder conviction should have\nremained undisturbed”). But the Court in Cobb did not\nconsider itself bound by Brewer’s implicit holding on the\nattachment question. See 532 U. S., at 169 (“Constitu-\ntional rights are not defined by inferences from opinions\nwhich did not address the question at issue”). And here,\nas in Cobb, Brewer did not address the fact that the ar-\nraignment on the warrant was not the same type of ar-\nraignment at which the right to counsel had previously\nbeen held to attach, and the parties did not argue the\nquestion. Brewer is thus entitled to no more precedential\nweight here than it was in Cobb.\n   Nor does Jackson control. In Jackson, as in Brewer, the\nattachment issue was secondary. The question presented\nwas “not whether respondents had a right to counsel at\ntheir postarraignment, custodial interrogations,” 475\nU. S., at 629, but “whether respondents validly waived\ntheir right to counsel,” id., at 630. And, as in Brewer, the\nCourt’s waiver holding was vigorously disputed. See 475\nU. S., at 637–642 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); see also\nCobb, supra, at 174–177 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (ques-\ntioning Jackson’s vitality). Unlike in Brewer, however, the\nattachment question was at least contested in Jackson—\nbut barely. With respect to respondent Jackson, the State\nconceded the issue. Jackson, supra, at 629, n. 3. And with\nrespect to respondent Bladel, the State had conceded the\nissue below, see People v. Bladel, 421 Mich. 39, 77, 365\nN. W. 2d 56, 74 (1984) (Boyle, J., dissenting), and raised it\nfor the first time before this Court, devoting only three\npages of its brief to the question, see Brief for Petitioner in\nMichigan v. Bladel, O. T. 1985, No. 84–1539, pp. 24–26.\n   The Court disposed of the issue in a footnote. See Jack-\nson, supra, at 629–630, n. 3. As in Brewer, the Court did\nnot describe the nature of the proceeding. It stated only\nthat the respondents were “arraigned.” 475 U. S., at 627–\n                     Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                    15\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n628. The Court phrased the question presented in terms\nof “arraignment,” id., at 626 (“The question presented by\nthese two cases is whether the same rule applies to a\ndefendant who has been formally charged with a crime\nand who has requested appointment of counsel at his\narraignment”), and repeated the words “arraignment” or\n“postarraignment” no fewer than 35 times in the course of\nits opinion.\n   There is no way to know from the Court’s opinion in\nJackson whether the arraignment at issue there was the\nsame type of arraignment at which the right to counsel\nhad been held to attach in Powell and Hamilton. Only\nupon examination of the parties’ briefs does it become\nclear that the proceeding was in fact an initial appearance.\nBut Jackson did not even acknowledge, much less “flatly\nrejec[t] the distinction between initial arraignment and\narraignment on the indictment.” Ante, at 9. Instead, it\noffered one sentence of analysis—“In view of the clear\nlanguage in our decisions about the significance of ar-\nraignment, the State’s argument is untenable”—followed\nby a string citation to four cases, each of which quoted\nKirby. 475 U. S., at 629–630, n. 3. For emphasis, the\nCourt italicized the words “or arraignment” in Kirby’s\nattachment test. 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   The only rule that can be derived from the face of the\nopinion in Jackson is that if a proceeding is called an\n“arraignment,” the right to counsel attaches.2 That rule\n——————\n  2 The  Court asserts that Jackson’s “conclusion was driven by the\nsame considerations the Court had endorsed in Brewer,” namely, that\n“by the time a defendant is brought before a judicial officer, is informed\nof a formally lodged accusation, and has restrictions imposed on his\nliberty in aid of the prosecution, the State’s relationship with the\ndefendant has become solidly adversarial.” Ante, at 9. But Jackson\nsaid nothing of the sort.\n     Moreover, even looking behind the opinion, Jackson does not sup-\n16              ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwould not govern this case because petitioner’s initial\nappearance was not called an “arraignment” (the parties\nrefer to it as a “magistration”). And that would, in any\ncase, be a silly rule. The Sixth Amendment consequences\nof a proceeding should turn on the substance of what\nhappens there, not on what the State chooses to call it.\nBut the Court in Jackson did not focus on the substantive\ndistinction between an initial arraignment and an ar-\nraignment on the indictment. Instead, the Court simply\ncited Kirby and left it at that. In these circumstances, I\nwould recognize Jackson for what it was—a cursory\ntreatment of an issue that was not the primary focus of\nthe Court’s opinion. Surely Jackson’s footnote must yield\nto our reasoned precedents.\n   And our reasoned precedents provide no support for the\nconclusion that the right to counsel attaches at an initial\nappearance before a magistrate. Kirby explained why the\nright attaches “after the initiation of adversary judicial\ncriminal proceedings”:\n       “The initiation of judicial criminal proceedings is far\n     from a mere formalism. It is the starting point of our\n——————\nport the result the Court reaches today. Respondent Bladel entered a\n“not guilty” plea at his arraignment, see Brief for Petitioner in Michi-\ngan v. Bladel, O. T. 1985, No. 84–1539, p. 4, and both Hamilton v.\nAlabama, 368 U. S. 52 (1961), and White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59\n(1963) (per curiam), had already held that a defendant has a right to\ncounsel when he enters a plea. The Court suggests that this fact is\nirrelevant because the magistrate in Bladel’s case “had no jurisdiction\nto accept a plea of guilty to a felony charge.” Ante, at 10, n. 13. But\nthat distinction does not appear in either Hamilton or White. See\nHamilton, supra, at 55 (“Only the presence of counsel could have\nenabled this accused to know all the defenses available to him and to\nplead intelligently”); White, supra, at 60 (“[P]etitioner entered a plea\nbefore the magistrate and that plea was taken at a time when he had\nno counsel”). Thus, the most that Jackson can possibly be made to\nstand for is that the right to counsel attaches at an initial appearance\nwhere the defendant enters a plea. And that rule would not govern this\ncase because petitioner did not enter a plea at his initial appearance.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n    whole system of adversary criminal justice. For it is\n    only then that the government has committed itself to\n    prosecute, and only then that the adverse positions of\n    government and defendant have solidified. It is then\n    that a defendant finds himself faced with the prosecu-\n    torial forces of organized society, and immersed in the\n    intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law.\n    It is this point, therefore, that marks the commence-\n    ment of the ‘criminal prosecutions’ to which alone the\n    explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are ap-\n    plicable.” 406 U. S., at 689–690 (plurality opinion).\n  None of these defining characteristics of a “criminal\nprosecution” applies to petitioner’s initial appearance\nbefore the magistrate. The initial appearance was not an\n“adversary” proceeding, and petitioner was not “faced with\nthe prosecutorial forces of organized society.” Instead, he\nstood in front of a “little glass window,” filled out various\nforms, and was read his Miranda rights. Brief for Re-\nspondent 5. The State had not committed itself to prose-\ncute—only a prosecutor may file felony charges in Texas,\nsee Tex. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. Arts. 2.01, 2.02 (West\n2005), and there is no evidence that any prosecutor was\neven aware of petitioner’s arrest or appearance. The\nadverse positions of government and defendant had not\nyet solidified—the State’s prosecutorial officers had not\nyet decided whether to press charges and, if so, which\ncharges to press. And petitioner was not immersed in the\nintricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law—\nshortly after the proceeding he was free on bail, and no\nfurther proceedings occurred until six months later when\nhe was indicted.\n  Moreover, the Court’s holding that the right to counsel\nattaches at an initial appearance is untethered from any\ninterest that we have heretofore associated with the right\nto counsel. The Court has repeatedly emphasized that\n18            ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n“[t]he purpose of the constitutional guaranty of a right to\ncounsel is to protect an accused from conviction resulting\nfrom his own ignorance of his legal and constitutional\nrights.” Johnson, 304 U. S., at 465. The “core purpose” of\nthe right, the Court has said, is to “assure ‘Assistance’ at\ntrial, when the accused [is] confronted with both the intri-\ncacies of the law and the advocacy of the public prosecu-\ntor.” United States v. Ash, 413 U. S. 300, 309 (1973). The\nCourt has extended the right to counsel to pretrial events\nonly when the absence of counsel would derogate from the\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial. See, e.g., Wade, 388 U. S.,\nat 227.\n   Neither petitioner nor the Court identifies any way in\nwhich petitioner’s ability to receive a fair trial was under-\nmined by the absence of counsel during the period between\nhis initial appearance and his indictment. Nothing during\nthat period exposed petitioner to the risk that he would be\nconvicted as the result of ignorance of his rights. Instead,\nthe gravamen of petitioner’s complaint is that if counsel\nhad been appointed earlier, he would have been able to\nstave off indictment by convincing the prosecutor that\npetitioner was not guilty of the crime alleged. But the\nSixth Amendment protects against the risk of erroneous\nconviction, not the risk of unwarranted prosecution. See\nGouveia, 467 U. S., at 191 (rejecting the notion that the\n“purpose of the right to counsel is to provide a defendant\nwith a preindictment private investigator”).\n   Petitioner argues that the right to counsel is implicated\nhere because restrictions were imposed on his liberty\nwhen he was required to post bail. But we have never\nsuggested that the accused’s right to the assistance of\ncounsel “for his defence” entails a right to use counsel as a\nsword to contest pretrial detention. To the contrary, we\nhave flatly rejected that notion, reasoning that a defen-\ndant’s liberty interests are protected by other constitu-\ntional guarantees. See id., at 190 (“While the right to\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           19\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncounsel exists to protect the accused during trial-type\nconfrontations with the prosecutor, the speedy trial right\nexists primarily to protect an individual’s liberty interest,”\nincluding the interest in reducing the “ ‘impairment of\nliberty imposed on an accused while released on bail’ ”).\n                           IV\n  In sum, neither the original meaning of the Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel nor our precedents interpret-\ning the scope of that right supports the Court’s holding\nthat the right attaches at an initial appearance before a\nmagistrate.
