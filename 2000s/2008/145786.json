We must decide whether in these circumstances the Constitution forbids a State from insisting that the defendant proceed to trial with counsel, the State thereby denying the defendant the right to represent himself. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 6; <i>Faretta v. California,</i> 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). We conclude that the Constitution does not forbid a State so to insist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2382</span> I</h2>\n<p>In July 1999 Ahmad Edwards, the respondent, tried to steal a pair of shoes from an Indiana department store. After he was discovered, he drew a gun, fired at a store security officer, and wounded a bystander. He was caught and then charged with attempted murder, battery with a deadly weapon, criminal recklessness, and theft. His mental condition subsequently became the subject of three competency proceedings and two self-representation requests, mostly before the same trial judge:</p>\n<p>1. <i>First Competency Hearing: August 2000.</i> Five months after Edwards' arrest, his court-appointed counsel asked for a psychiatric evaluation. After hearing psychiatrist and neuropsychologist witnesses (in February 2000 and again in August 2000), the court found Edwards incompetent to stand trial, App. 365a, and committed him to Logansport State Hospital for evaluation and treatment, see <i>id.,</i> at 48a-53a.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Second Competency Hearing: March 2002.</i> Seven months after his commitment, doctors found that Edwards' condition had improved to the point where he could stand trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 63a-64a. Several months later, however, but still before trial, Edwards' counsel asked for another psychiatric evaluation. In March 2002, the judge held a competency hearing, considered additional psychiatric evidence, and (in April) found that Edwards, while \"suffer[ing] from mental illness,\" was \"competent to assist his attorneys in his defense and stand trial for the charged crimes.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 114a.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Third Competency Hearing: April 2003.</i> Seven months later but still before trial, Edwards' counsel sought yet another psychiatric evaluation of his client. And, in April 2003, the court held yet another competency hearing. Edwards' counsel presented further psychiatric and neuropsychological evidence showing that Edwards was suffering from serious thinking difficulties and delusions. A testifying psychiatrist reported that Edwards could understand the charges against him, but he was \"unable to cooperate with his attorney in his defense because of his schizophrenic illness\"; \"[h]is delusions and his marked difficulties in thinking make it impossible for him to cooperate with his attorney.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 164a. In November 2003, the court concluded that Edwards was not then competent to stand trial and ordered his recommitment to the state hospital. <i>Id.,</i> at 206a-211a.</p>\n<p>4. <i>First Self-Representation Request and First Trial: June 2005.</i> About eight months after his commitment, the hospital reported that Edwards' condition had again improved to the point that he had again become competent to stand trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 228a-236a. And almost one year after that Edwards' trial began. Just before trial, Edwards asked to represent himself. <i>Id.,</i> at 509a, 520a. He also asked for a continuance, which, he said, he needed in order to proceed <i>pro se. Id.,</i> at 519a-520a. The court refused the continuance. <i>Id.,</i> at 520a. Edwards then proceeded to trial represented by counsel. The jury convicted him of criminal recklessness and theft but failed to reach a verdict on the charges of attempted murder and battery.</p>\n<p>5. <i>Second Self-Representation Request and Second Trial: December 2005.</i> The State decided to retry Edwards on the attempted murder and battery charges. Just before the retrial, Edwards again asked the court to permit him to represent himself. <i>Id.,</i> at 279a-282a. Referring to the lengthy record of psychiatric reports, the trial court noted that Edwards still suffered from schizophrenia and concluded that \"[w]ith these findings, he's competent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2383</span> to stand trial but I'm not going to find he's competent to defend himself.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 527a. The court denied Edwards' self-representation request. Edwards was represented by appointed counsel at his retrial. The jury convicted Edwards on both of the remaining counts.</p>\n<p>Edwards subsequently appealed to Indiana's intermediate appellate court. He argued that the trial court's refusal to permit him to represent himself at his retrial deprived him of his constitutional right of self-representation. U.S. Const., Amdt. 6; <i>Faretta, supra</i><i>.</i> The court agreed and ordered a new trial. The matter then went to the Indiana Supreme Court. That court found that \"[t]he record in this case presents a substantial basis to agree with the trial court,\" 866 N.E.2d 252, 260 (2007), but it nonetheless affirmed the intermediate appellate court on the belief that this Court's precedents, namely, <i>Faretta,</i> 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, and <i>Godinez v. Moran,</i> 509 U.S. 389, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993), required the State to allow Edwards to represent himself. At Indiana's request, we agreed to consider whether the Constitution required the trial court to allow Edwards to represent himself at trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Our examination of this Court's precedents convinces us that those precedents frame the question presented, but they do not answer it. The two cases that set forth the Constitution's \"mental competence\" standard, <i>Dusky v. United States,</i> 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> and <i>Drope v. Missouri,</i> 420 U.S. 162, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975), specify that the Constitution does not permit trial of an individual who lacks \"mental competency.\" <i>Dusky</i> defines the competency standard as including both (1) \"whether\" the defendant has \"a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him\" and (2) whether the defendant \"has sufficient present ability <i>to consult with his lawyer</i> with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\" 362 U.S., at 402, 80 S.Ct. 788 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). <i>Drope</i> repeats that standard, stating that it \"has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, <i>to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense</i> may not be subjected to a trial.\" 420 U.S., at 171, 95 S.Ct. 896 (emphasis added). Neither case considered the mental competency issue presented here, namely, the relation of the mental competence standard to the right of self-representation.</p>\n<p>The Court's foundational \"self-representation\" case, <i>Faretta,</i> held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments include a \"constitutional right to proceed <i>without</i> counsel when\" a criminal defendant \"voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.\" 422 U.S., at 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (emphasis in original). The Court implied that right from: (1) a \"nearly universal conviction,\" made manifest in state law, that \"forcing a lawyer upon an unwilling defendant is contrary to his basic right to defend himself if he truly wants to do so,\" <i>id.,</i> at 817-818, 95 S.Ct. 2525; (2) Sixth Amendment language granting rights to the \"accused;\" (3) Sixth Amendment structure indicating that the rights it sets forth, related to the \"fair administration of American justice,\" are \"persona[l]\" to the accused, <i>id.,</i> at 818-821, 95 S.Ct. 2525; (4) the absence of historical examples of <i>forced</i> representation, <i>id.,</i> at 821-832, 95 S.Ct. 2525; and (5) \"`respect for the individual,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (quoting <i>Illinois v. Allen,</i> 397 U.S. 337, 350-351, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2384</span> (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring) (a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel \"must be honored out of `that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law'\")).</p>\n<p><i>Faretta</i> does not answer the question before us both because it did not consider the problem of mental competency (cf. 422 U.S., at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (Faretta was \"literate, competent, and understanding\")), and because <i>Faretta</i> itself and later cases have made clear that the right of self-representation is not absolute. See <i>Martinez v. Court of Appeal of Cal., Fourth Appellate Dist.,</i> 528 U.S. 152, 163, 120 S.Ct. 684, 145 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000) (no right of self-representation on direct appeal in a criminal case); <i>McKaskle v. Wiggins,</i> 465 U.S. 168, 178-179, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984) (appointment of standby counsel over self-represented defendant's objection is permissible); <i>Faretta,</i> 422 U.S., at 835, n. 46, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (no right \"to abuse the dignity of the courtroom\"); <i>ibid.</i> (no right to avoid compliance with \"relevant rules of procedural and substantive law\"); <i>id.,</i> at 834, n. 46 (no right to \"engag[e] in serious and obstructionist misconduct,\" referring to <i>Illinois v. Allen, supra</i>). The question here concerns a mental-illness-related limitation on the scope of the self-representation right.</p>\n<p>The sole case in which this Court considered mental competence and self-representation together, <i>Godinez, supra,</i> presents a question closer to that at issue here. The case focused upon a borderline-competent criminal defendant who had asked a state trial court to permit him to represent himself and to change his pleas from not guilty to guilty. The state trial court had found that the defendant met <i>Dusky</i>'s mental competence standard, that he \"knowingly and intelligently\" waived his right to assistance of counsel, and that he \"freely and voluntarily\" chose to plead guilty. 509 U.S., at 393, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the state trial court had consequently granted the defendant's self-representation and change-of-plea requests. See <i>id.,</i> at 392-393, 113 S.Ct. 2680. A federal appeals court, however, had vacated the defendant's guilty pleas on the ground that the Constitution required the trial court to ask a further question, namely, whether the defendant was competent to waive his constitutional right to counsel. See <i>id.,</i> at 393-394, 113 S.Ct. 2680. Competence to make that latter decision, the appeals court said, required the defendant to satisfy a higher mental competency standard than the standard set forth in <i>Dusky.</i> See 509 U.S., at 393-394, 113 S.Ct. 2680. <i>Dusky</i>'s more general standard sought only to determine whether a defendant represented by counsel was competent to stand trial, not whether he was competent to waive his right to counsel. 509 U.S., at 394-395, 113 S.Ct. 2680.</p>\n<p>This Court, reversing the Court of Appeals, \"reject[ed] the notion that competence to plead guilty or to waive the right to counsel must be measured by a standard that is higher than (or even different from) the <i>Dusky</i> standard.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 398, 113 S.Ct. 2680. The decision to plead guilty, we said, \"is no more complicated than the sum total of decisions that a [represented] defendant may be called upon to make during the course of a trial.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Hence \"there is no reason to believe that the decision to waive counsel requires an appreciably higher level of mental functioning than the decision to waive other constitutional rights.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 399, 113 S.Ct. 2680. And even assuming that self-representation might pose special trial-related difficulties, \"the competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the competence to <i>waive the right,</i> not the competence to represent himself.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2385</span> original). For this reason, we concluded, \"the defendant's `technical legal knowledge' is `not relevant' to the determination.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 400, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (quoting <i>Faretta, supra,</i> at 836, 95 S.Ct. 2525).</p>\n<p>We concede that <i>Godinez</i> bears certain similarities with the present case. Both involve mental competence and self-representation. Both involve a defendant who wants to represent himself. Both involve a mental condition that falls in a gray area between <i>Dusky</i>'s minimal constitutional requirement that measures a defendant's ability to stand trial and a somewhat higher standard that measures mental fitness for another legal purpose.</p>\n<p>We nonetheless conclude that <i>Godinez</i> does not answer the question before us now. In part that is because the Court of Appeals higher standard at issue in <i>Godinez</i> differs in a critical way from the higher standard at issue here. In <i>Godinez,</i> the higher standard sought to measure the defendant's ability to proceed on his own to enter a guilty plea; here the higher standard seeks to measure the defendant's ability to conduct trial proceedings. To put the matter more specifically, the <i>Godinez</i> defendant sought only to change his pleas to guilty, he did not seek to conduct trial proceedings, and his ability to conduct a defense at trial was expressly not at issue. Thus we emphasized in <i>Godinez</i> that we needed to consider only the defendant's \"competence to <i>waive the right.</i>\" 509 U.S., at 399, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (emphasis in original). And we further emphasized that we need <i>not</i> consider the defendant's \"technical legal knowledge\" about how to proceed at trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 400, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (internal quotation marks omitted). We found our holding consistent with this Court's earlier statement in <i>Massey v. Moore,</i> 348 U.S. 105, 108, 75 S.Ct. 145, 99 L.Ed. 135 (1954), that \"[o]ne might not be insane in the sense of being incapable of standing trial and yet lack the capacity to stand trial without benefit of counsel.\" See <i>Godinez, supra,</i> at 399-400, n. 10, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (quoting <i>Massey</i> and noting that it dealt with \"a question that is quite different from the question presented\" in <i>Godinez</i>). In this case, the very matters that we did not consider in <i>Godinez</i> are directly before us.</p>\n<p>For another thing, <i>Godinez</i> involved a State that sought to <i>permit</i> a gray-area defendant to represent himself. <i>Godinez</i>'s constitutional holding is that a State may do so. But that holding simply does not tell a State whether it may <i>deny</i> a gray-area defendant the right to represent himself\u0097the matter at issue here. One might argue that <i>Godinez</i>'s grant (to a State) of permission to allow a gray-area defendant self-representation must implicitly include permission to deny self-representation. Cf. 509 U.S., at 402, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (\"States are free to adopt competency standards that are more elaborate than the <i>Dusky</i> formulation\"). Yet one could more forcefully argue that <i>Godinez</i> simply did not consider whether the Constitution <i>requires</i> self-representation by gray-area defendants even in circumstances where the State seeks to disallow it (the question here). The upshot is that, in our view, the question before us is an open one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We now turn to the question presented. We assume that a criminal defendant has sufficient mental competence to stand trial (<i>i.e.,</i> the defendant meets <i>Dusky</i>'s standard) and that the defendant insists on representing himself during that trial. We ask whether the Constitution permits a State to limit that defendant's self-representation right by insisting upon representation by counsel at trial\u0097on the ground that the defendant lacks the mental capacity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2386</span> to conduct his trial defense unless represented.</p>\n<p>Several considerations taken together lead us to conclude that the answer to this question is yes. First, the Court's precedent, while not answering the question, points slightly in the direction of our affirmative answer. <i>Godinez,</i> as we have just said, simply leaves the question open. But the Court's \"mental competency\" cases set forth a standard that focuses directly upon a defendant's \"present ability to consult with his lawyer,\" <i>Dusky,</i> 362 U.S., at 402, 80 S.Ct. 788 (internal quotation marks omitted); a \"capacity . . . to consult with counsel,\" and an ability \"to assist [counsel] in preparing his defense,\" <i>Drope,</i> 420 U.S., at 171, 95 S.Ct. 896. See <i>ibid.</i> (\"It has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, <i>to consult with counsel,</i> and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial\" (emphasis added)). These standards assume representation by counsel and emphasize the importance of counsel. They thus suggest (though do not hold) that an instance in which a defendant who would choose to forgo counsel at trial presents a very different set of circumstances, which in our view, calls for a different standard.</p>\n<p>At the same time <i>Faretta,</i> the foundational self-representation case, rested its conclusion in part upon pre-existing state law set forth in cases all of which are consistent with, and at least two of which expressly adopt, a competency limitation on the self-representation right. See 422 U.S., at 813, and n. 9, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (citing 16 state-court decisions and two secondary sources). See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Cappetta v. State,</i> 204 So.2d 913, 917-918 (Fla.App.1967), rev'd on other grounds, 216 So.2d 749 (Fla.1968), cited in <i>Faretta, supra,</i> at 813, n. 9, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (assuring a \"mentally competent\" defendant the right \"to conduct his own defense\" <i>provided that</i> \"no unusual circumstances exist\" such as, <i>e.g.,</i> \"mental derangement\" that \"would . . . depriv[e]\" the defendant \"of a fair trial if allowed to conduct his own defense,\" 204 So.2d, at 917-918); <i>id.,</i> at 918 (noting that \"whether unusual circumstances are evident is a matter resting in the sound discretion granted to the trial judge\"); <i>Allen v. Commonwealth,</i> 324 Mass. 558, 562-563, 87 N.E.2d 192, 195 (1949) (noting \"the assignment of counsel\" was \"necessary\" where there was some \"special circumstance\" such as when the criminal defendant was \"mentally defective\").</p>\n<p>Second, the nature of the problem before us cautions against the use of a single mental competency standard for deciding both (1) whether a defendant who is represented by counsel can proceed to trial and (2) whether a defendant who goes to trial must be permitted to represent himself. Mental illness itself is not a unitary concept. It varies in degree. It can vary over time. It interferes with an individual's functioning at different times in different ways. The history of this case (set forth in Part I, <i>supra)</i> illustrates the complexity of the problem. In certain instances an individual may well be able to satisfy <i>Dusky</i>'s mental competence standard, for he will be able to work with counsel at trial, yet at the same time he may be unable to carry out the basic tasks needed to present his own defense without the help of counsel. See, <i>e.g.,</i> N. Poythress, R. Bonnie, J. Monahan, R. Otto, &amp; S. Hoge, Adjudicative Competence: The MacArthur Studies 103 (2002) (\"Within each domain of adjudicative competence (competence to assist counsel; decisional competence) the data indicate that understanding, reasoning, and appreciation [of the charges against a defendant] are separable and somewhat independent aspects of functional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2387</span> legal ability\"). See also <i>McKaskle,</i> 465 U.S., at 174, 104 S.Ct. 944 (describing trial tasks as including organization of defense, making motions, arguing points of law, participating in <i>voir dire,</i> questioning witnesses, and addressing the court and jury).</p>\n<p>The American Psychiatric Association (APA) tells us (without dispute) in its <i>amicus</i> brief filed in support of neither party that \"[d]isorganized thinking, deficits in sustaining attention and concentration, impaired expressive abilities, anxiety, and other common symptoms of severe mental illnesses can impair the defendant's ability to play the significantly expanded role required for self-representation even if he can play the lesser role of represented defendant.\" Brief for APA et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 26. Motions and other documents that the defendant prepared in this case (one of which we include in the Appendix, <i>infra</i>) suggest to a layperson the common sense of this general conclusion.</p>\n<p>Third, in our view, a right of self-representation at trial will not \"affirm the dignity\" of a defendant who lacks the mental capacity to conduct his defense without the assistance of counsel. <i>McKaskle, supra,</i> at 176-177, 104 S.Ct. 944 (\"Dignity\" and \"autonomy\" of individual underlie self-representation right). To the contrary, given that defendant's uncertain mental state, the spectacle that could well result from his self-representation at trial is at least as likely to prove humiliating as ennobling. Moreover, insofar as a defendant's lack of capacity threatens an improper conviction or sentence, self-representation in that exceptional context undercuts the most basic of the Constitution's criminal law objectives, providing a fair trial. As Justice Brennan put it, \"[t]he Constitution would protect none of us if it prevented the courts from acting to preserve the very processes that the Constitution itself prescribes.\" <i>Allen,</i> 397 U.S., at 350, 90 S.Ct. 1057 (concurring opinion). See <i>Martinez,</i> 528 U.S., at 162, 120 S.Ct. 684 (\"Even at the trial level . . . the government's interest in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the trial at times outweighs the defendant's interest in acting as his own lawyer\"). See also <i>Sell v. United States,</i> 539 U.S. 166, 180, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197 (2003) (\"[T]he Government has a concomitant, constitutionally essential interest in assuring that the defendant's trial is a fair one\").</p>\n<p>Further, proceedings must not only be fair, they must \"appear fair to all who observe them.\" <i>Wheat v. United States,</i> 486 U.S. 153, 160, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988). An <i>amicus</i> brief reports one psychiatrist's reaction to having observed a patient (a patient who had satisfied <i>Dusky</i>) try to conduct his own defense: \"[H]ow in the world can our legal system allow an insane man to defend himself?\" Brief for Ohio et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 24 (internal quotation marks omitted). See <i>Massey,</i> 348 U.S., at 108, 75 S.Ct. 145 (\"No trial can be fair that leaves the defense to a man who is insane, unaided by counsel, and who by reason of his mental condition stands helpless and alone before the court\"). The application of <i>Dusky</i>'s basic mental competence standard can help in part to avoid this result. But given the different capacities needed to proceed to trial without counsel, there is little reason to believe that <i>Dusky</i> alone is sufficient. At the same time, the trial judge, particularly one such as the trial judge in this case, who presided over one of Edwards' competency hearings and his two trials, will often prove best able to make more fine-tuned mental capacity decisions, tailored to the individualized circumstances of a particular defendant.</p>\n<p>We consequently conclude that the Constitution permits judges to take realistic account of the particular defendant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2388</span> mental capacities by asking whether a defendant who seeks to conduct his own defense at trial is mentally competent to do so. That is to say, the Constitution permits States to insist upon representation by counsel for those competent enough to stand trial under <i>Dusky</i> but who still suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Indiana has also asked us to adopt, as a measure of a defendant's ability to conduct a trial, a more specific standard that would \"deny a criminal defendant the right to represent himself at trial where the defendant cannot communicate coherently with the court or a jury.\" Brief for Petitioner 20 (emphasis deleted). We are sufficiently uncertain, however, as to how that particular standard would work in practice to refrain from endorsing it as a federal constitutional standard here. We need not now, and we do not, adopt it.</p>\n<p>Indiana has also asked us to overrule <i>Faretta.</i> We decline to do so. We recognize that judges have sometimes expressed concern that <i>Faretta,</i> contrary to its intent, has led to trials that are unfair. See <i>Martinez, supra,</i> at 164, 120 S.Ct. 684 (BREYER, J., concurring) (noting practical concerns of trial judges). But recent empirical research suggests that such instances are not common. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Hashimoto, Defending the Right of Self-Representation: An Empirical Look at the Pro Se Felony Defendant, 85 N.C.L.Rev. 423, 427, 447, 428 (2007) (noting that of the small number of defendants who chose to proceed <i>pro se</i>\u0097\"roughly 0.3% to 0.5%\" of the total, state felony defendants in particular \"appear to have achieved higher felony acquittal rates than their represented counterparts in that they were less likely to have been convicted of felonies\"). At the same time, instances in which the trial's fairness is in doubt may well be concentrated in the 20 percent or so of self-representation cases where the mental competence of the defendant is also at issue. See <i>id.,</i> at 428 (about 20 percent of federal <i>pro se</i> felony defendants ordered to undergo competency evaluations). If so, today's opinion, assuring trial judges the authority to deal appropriately with cases in the latter category, may well alleviate those fair trial concerns.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX</h2>\n<p>Excerpt from respondent's filing entitled \"`Defendant's Version of the Instant Offense,'\" which he had attached to his presentence investigation report:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`The appointed motion of permissive intervention filed therein the court superior on, 6-26-01 caused a stay of action and apon it's expiration or thereafter three years the plan to establish a youth program to and for the coordination of aspects of law enforcement to prevent and reduce crime amoung young people in Indiana became a diplomatic act as under the Safe Streets Act of 1967, \"A omnibuc considerate agent: I membered clients within the public and others that at/production of the courts actions showcased causes.

California,</i> 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). A mentally ill defendant who knowingly and voluntarily elects to proceed <i>pro se</i> instead of through counsel receives a fair trial that comports with the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Godinez v. Moran,</i> 509 U.S. 389, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993). The Court today concludes that a State may nonetheless strip a mentally ill defendant of the right to represent himself when that would be fairer. In my view the Constitution does not permit a State to substitute its own perception of fairness for the defendant's right to make his own case before the jury\u0097a specific right long understood as essential to a fair trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Ahmad Edwards suffers from schizophrenia, an illness that has manifested itself in different ways over time, depending on how and whether Edwards was treated as well as on other factors that appear harder to identify. In the years between 2000 and 2003\u0097years in which Edwards was apparently not treated with the antipsychotic medications and other drugs that are commonly prescribed for his illness\u0097 Edwards was repeatedly declared incompetent to stand trial. Even during this period, however, his mental state seems to have fluctuated. For instance, one psychiatrist in March 2001 described Edwards in a competency report as \"free of psychosis, depression, mania, and confusion,\" \"alert, oriented, [and] appropriate,\" apparently \"able to think clearly\" and apparently \"psychiatrically normal.\" App. 61a.</p>\n<p>Edwards seems to have been treated with antipsychotic medication for the first time in 2004. He was found competent to stand trial the same year. The psychiatrist making the recommendation described Edwards' thought processes as \"coherent\" and wrote that he \"communicate[d] very well,\" that his speech was \"easy to understand,\" that he displayed \"good communications skills, cooperative attitude, average intelligence, and good cognitive functioning,\" that he could \"appraise the roles of the participants in the courtroom proceedings,\" and that he had the capacity to challenge prosecution witnesses realistically and to testify relevantly. <i>Id.,</i> at 232a-235a (report of Dr. Robert Sena).</p>\n<p>Over the course of what became two separate criminal trials, Edwards sought to act as his own lawyer. He filed a number of incoherent written pleadings with the judge on which the Court places emphasis, but he also filed several intelligible pleadings, such as a motion to dismiss counsel, a motion to dismiss charges under the Indiana speedy trial provision, and a motion seeking a trial transcript.</p>\n<p>Edwards made arguments in the courtroom that were more coherent than his written pleadings. In seeking to represent himself at his first trial, Edwards complained in detail that the attorney representing him had not spent adequate time preparing and was not sharing legal materials for use in his defense. The trial judge concluded that Edwards had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel and proceeded to quiz Edwards about matters of state law. Edwards correctly answered questions about the meaning of <i>voir dire</i> and how it operated, and described the basic framework for admitting videotape evidence to trial, though he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2390</span> was unable to answer other questions, including questions about the topics covered by state evidentiary rules that the judge identified only by number. He persisted in his request to represent himself, but the judge denied the request because Edwards acknowledged he would need a continuance. Represented by counsel, he was convicted of criminal recklessness and theft, but the jury deadlocked on charges of attempted murder and battery.</p>\n<p>At his second trial, Edwards again asked the judge to be allowed to proceed <i>pro se.</i> He explained that he and his attorney disagreed about which defense to present to the attempted murder charge. Edwards' counsel favored lack of intent to kill; Edwards, self-defense. As the defendant put it: \"My objection is me and my attorney actually had discussed a defense, I think prosecution had mentioned that, and we are in disagreement with it. He has a defense and I have a defense that I would like to represent or present to the Judge.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 523a.</p>\n<p>The court again rejected Edwards' request to proceed <i>pro se,</i> and this time it did not have the justification that Edwards had sought a continuance. The court did not dispute that Edwards knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel, but stated it was \"going to carve out a third exception\" to the right of self-representation, and\u0097without explaining precisely what abilities Edwards lacked\u0097stated Edwards was \"competent to stand trial but I'm not going to find he's competent to defend himself.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 527a. Edwards sought\u0097by a request through counsel and by raising an objection in open court\u0097to address the judge on the matter, but the judge refused, stating that the issue had already been decided. Edwards' court-appointed attorney pursued the defense the attorney judged best\u0097lack of intent, not self-defense\u0097and Edwards was convicted of both attempted murder and battery. The Supreme Court of Indiana held that he was entitled to a new trial because he had been denied the right to represent himself. The State of Indiana sought certiorari, which we granted. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 741, 169 L.Ed.2d 579 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Constitution guarantees to every criminal defendant the \"right to proceed <i>without</i> counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.\" <i>Faretta,</i> 422 U.S., at 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525. The right reflects \"a nearly universal conviction, on the part of our people as well as our courts, that forcing a lawyer upon an unwilling defendant is contrary to his basic right to defend himself if he truly wants to do so.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 817, 95 S.Ct. 2525. <i>Faretta</i>'s discussion of the history of the right, <i>id.,</i> at 821-833, 95 S.Ct. 2525, includes the observation that \"[i]n the long history of British criminal jurisprudence, there was only one tribunal that ever adopted a practice of forcing counsel upon an unwilling defendant in a criminal proceeding. The tribunal was the Star Chamber,\" <i>id.,</i> at 821, 95 S.Ct. 2525. <i>Faretta</i> described the right to proceed <i>pro se</i> as a premise of the Sixth Amendment, which confers the tools for a defense on the \"accused,\" and describes the role of the attorney as one of \"assistance.\" The right of self-representation could also be seen as a part of the traditional meaning of the Due Process Clause. See <i>Martinez v. Court of Appeal of Cal., Fourth Appellate Dist.,</i> 528 U.S. 152, 165, 120 S.Ct. 684, 145 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Whichever provision provides its source, it means that a State simply may not force a lawyer upon a criminal defendant who wishes to conduct his own defense. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2391</span> <i>Faretta,</i> 422 U.S., at 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525.</p>\n<p>Exercising the right of self-representation requires waiving the right to counsel. A defendant may represent himself only when he \"`knowingly and intelligently'\" waives the lawyer's assistance that is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <i>Id.,</i> at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525. He must \"be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation,\" and the record must \"establish that `he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann,</i> 317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942)). This limitation may be relevant to many mentally ill defendants, but there is no dispute that Edwards was not one of them. Edwards was warned extensively of the risks of proceeding <i>pro se.</i> The trial judge found that Edwards had \"knowingly and voluntarily\" waived his right to counsel at his first trial, App. 512a, and at his second trial the judge denied him the right to represent himself only by \"carv[ing] out\" a new \"exception\" to the right beyond the standard of knowing and voluntary waiver, <i>id.,</i> at 527a.</p>\n<p>When a defendant appreciates the risks of forgoing counsel and chooses to do so voluntarily, the Constitution protects his ability to present his own defense even when that harms his case. In fact waiving counsel \"usually\" does so. <i>McKaskle v. Wiggins,</i> 465 U.S. 168, 177, n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984); see also <i>Faretta,</i> 422 U.S., at 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525. We have nonetheless said that the defendant's \"choice must be honored out of `that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> What the Constitution requires is not that a State's case be subject to the most rigorous adversarial testing possible\u0097after all, it permits a defendant to eliminate <i>all</i> adversarial testing by pleading guilty. What the Constitution requires is that a defendant be given the right to challenge the State's case against him using the arguments <i>he</i> sees fit.</p>\n<p>In <i>Godinez,</i> 509 U.S. 389, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321, we held that the Due Process Clause posed no barrier to permitting a defendant who suffered from mental illness both to waive his right to counsel and to plead guilty, so long as he was competent to stand trial and knowingly and voluntarily waived trial and the counsel right. <i>Id.,</i> at 391, 400, 113 S.Ct. 2680. It was \"never the rule at common law\" that a defendant could be competent to stand trial and yet incompetent to either exercise or give up some of the rights provided for his defense. <i>Id.,</i> at 404, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). We rejected the invitation to craft a higher competency standard for waiving counsel than for standing trial. That proposal, we said, was built on the \"flawed premise\" that a defendant's \"competence to represent himself\" was the relevant measure: \"[T]he competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the competence to <i>waive the right,</i> not the competence to represent himself.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 399, 113 S.Ct. 2680. We grounded this on <i>Faretta</i>'s candid acknowledgment that the Sixth Amendment protected the defendant's right to conduct a defense to his disadvantage. 509 U.S. at 399-400, 113 S.Ct. 2680.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court is correct that this case presents a variation on <i>Godinez:</i> It presents the question not whether another constitutional requirement (in <i>Godinez,</i> the proposed higher degree of competence required for a waiver) limits a defendant's constitutional right to elect self-representation, but whether a State's view of fairness <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2392</span> (or of other values) permits it to strip the defendant of this right. But that makes the question before us an easier one. While one constitutional requirement must yield to another in case of conflict, nothing permits a State, because of <i>its</i> view of what is fair, to deny a constitutional protection. Although \"the purpose of the rights set forth in [the Sixth] Amendment is to ensure a fair trial,\" it \"does not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez,</i> 548 U.S. 140, 145, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006). Thus, although the Confrontation Clause aims to produce fairness by ensuring the reliability of testimony, States may not provide for unconfronted testimony to be used at trial so long as it is reliable. <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 61, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). We have rejected an approach to individual liberties that \"`abstracts from the right to its purposes, and then eliminates the right.'\" <i>Gonzalez-Lopez, supra,</i> at 145, 126 S.Ct. 2557 (quoting <i>Maryland v. Craig,</i> 497 U.S. 836, 862, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p>Until today, the right of self-representation has been accorded the same respect as other constitutional guarantees. The only circumstance in which we have permitted the State to deprive a defendant of this trial right is the one under which we have allowed the State to deny <i>other</i> such rights: when it is necessary to enable the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion. That overriding necessity, we have said, justifies forfeiture of even the Sixth Amendment right to be present at trial\u0097 if, after being threatened with removal, a defendant \"insists on conducting himself in a manner so disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that his trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom.\" <i>Illinois v. Allen,</i> 397 U.S. 337, 343, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970). A <i>pro se</i> defendant may not \"abuse the dignity of the courtroom,\" nor may he fail to \"comply with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law,\" and a court may \"terminate\" the self-representation of a defendant who \"deliberately engages in serious and obstructionist misconduct.\" <i>Faretta, supra,</i> at 834-835, n. 46, 95 S.Ct. 2525. This ground for terminating self-representation is unavailable here, however, because Edwards was not even allowed to begin to represent himself, and because he was respectful and compliant and did not provide a basis to conclude a trial could not have gone forward had he been allowed to press his own claims.</p>\n<p>Beyond this circumstance, we have never constrained the ability of a defendant to retain \"actual control over the case he chooses to present to the jury\"\u0097what we have termed \"the core of the <i>Faretta</i> right.\" <i>Wiggins, supra,</i> at 178, 104 S.Ct. 944. Thus, while <i>Faretta</i> recognized that the right of self-representation does not bar the court from appointing standby counsel, we explained in <i>Wiggins</i> that \"[t]he <i>pro se</i> defendant must be allowed to control the organization and content of his own defense, to make motions, to argue points of law, to participate in <i>voir dire,</i> to question witnesses, and to address the court and the jury at appropriate points in the trial.\" 465 U.S., at 174, 104 S.Ct. 944. Furthermore, because \"multiple voices `for the defense'\" could \"confuse the message the defendant wishes to convey,\" <i>id.,</i> at 177, 104 S.Ct. 944, a standby attorney's participation would be barred when it would \"destroy the jury's perception that the defendant is representing himself,\" <i>id.,</i> at 178, 104 S.Ct. 944.</p>\n<p>As I have explained, I would not adopt an approach to the right of self-representation that we have squarely rejected for other rights\u0097allowing courts to disregard <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2393</span> the right when doing so serves the purposes for which the right was intended. But if I were to adopt such an approach, I would remain in dissent, because I believe the Court's assessment of the purposes of the right of self-representation is inaccurate to boot. While there is little doubt that preserving individual \"`dignity'\" (to which the Court refers), <i>ante,</i> at 2387, is paramount among those purposes, there is equally little doubt that the loss of \"dignity\" the right is designed to prevent is <i>not</i> the defendant's making a fool of himself by presenting an amateurish or even incoherent defense. Rather, the dignity at issue is the supreme human dignity of being master of one's fate rather than a ward of the State\u0097the dignity of individual choice. <i>Faretta</i> explained that the Sixth Amendment's counsel clause should not be invoked to impair \"`the exercise of [the defendant's] free choice'\" to dispense with the right, 422 U.S., at 815, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (quoting <i>Adams,</i> 317 U.S., at 280, 63 S.Ct. 236); for \"whatever else may be said of those who wrote the Bill of Rights, surely there can be no doubt that they understood the inestimable worth of free choice,\" 422 U.S., at 833-834, 95 S.Ct. 2525. Nine years later, when we wrote in <i>Wiggins</i> that the self-representation right served the \"dignity and autonomy of the accused,\" 465 U.S., at 177, 104 S.Ct. 944, we explained in no uncertain terms that this meant according every defendant the right to his say in court. In particular, we said that individual dignity and autonomy barred standby counsel from participating in a manner that would to \"destroy the jury's perception that the defendant is representing himself,\" and meant that \"the <i>pro se</i> defendant is entitled to preserve actual control over the case he chooses to present to the jury.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 178, 104 S.Ct. 944. In sum, if the Court is to honor the particular conception of \"dignity\" that underlies the self-representation right, it should respect the autonomy of the individual by honoring his choices knowingly and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p>A further purpose that the Court finds is advanced by denial of the right of self-representation is the purpose of assuring that trials \"appear fair to all who observe them.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2387. To my knowledge we have never denied a defendant a right simply on the ground that it would make his trial appear less \"fair\" to outside observers, and I would not inaugurate that principle here. But were I to do so, I would not apply it to deny a defendant the right to represent himself when he knowingly and voluntarily waives counsel. When Edwards stood to say that \"I have a defense that I would like to represent or present to the Judge,\" App. 523a, it seems to me the epitome of both actual and apparent unfairness for the judge to say, I have heard \"your desire to proceed by yourself and I've denied your request, so your attorney will speak for you from now on,\" <i>id.,</i> at 530a.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>It may be that the Court permits a State to deprive mentally ill defendants of a historic component of a fair trial because it is suspicious of the constitutional footing of the right of self-representation itself. The right is not explicitly set forth in the text of the Sixth Amendment, and some Members of this Court have expressed skepticism about <i>Faretta</i>'s holding. See <i>Martinez, supra,</i> at 156-158, 120 S.Ct. 684 (questioning relevance of historical evidence underlying <i>Faretta</i>'s holding); 528 U.S., at 164, 120 S.Ct. 684 (BREYER, J., concurring) (noting \"judges closer to the firing line have sometimes expressed dismay about the practical consequences\" of the right of self-representation).</p>\n<p>While the Sixth Amendment makes no mention of the right to forgo counsel, it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2394</span> provides the defendant, and not his lawyer, the right to call witnesses in his defense and to confront witnesses against him, and counsel is permitted to assist in \"<i>his</i> defence\" (emphasis added). Our trial system, however, allows the attorney representing a defendant \"full authority to manage the conduct of the trial\"\u0097an authority without which \"[t]he adversary process could not function effectively.\" <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> 484 U.S. 400, 418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988); see also <i>Florida v. Nixon,</i> 543 U.S. 175, 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004). We have held that \"the client must accept the consequences of the lawyer's decision to forgo cross-examination, to decide not to put certain witnesses on the stand, or to decide not to disclose the identity of certain witnesses in advance of trial.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 418, 108 S.Ct. 646. Thus, in order for the defendant's right to call his own witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses, and to put on a defense to be anything more than \"a tenuous and unacceptable legal fiction,\" a defendant must have consented to the representation of counsel. <i>Faretta, supra,</i> at 821, 95 S.Ct. 2525. Otherwise, \"the defense presented is not the defense guaranteed him by the Constitution, for in a very real sense, it is not <i>his</i> defense.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The facts of this case illustrate this point with the utmost clarity. Edwards wished to take a self-defense case to the jury. His counsel preferred a defense that focused on lack of intent. Having been denied the right to conduct his own defense, Edwards was convicted without having had the opportunity to present to the jury the grounds he believed supported his innocence. I do not doubt that he likely would have been convicted anyway. But to hold that a defendant may be deprived of the right to make legal arguments for acquittal simply because a state-selected agent has made different arguments on his behalf is, as Justice Frankfurter wrote in <i>Adams, supra,</i> at 280, 63 S.Ct. 236, to \"imprison a man in his privileges and call it the Constitution.\" In singling out mentally ill defendants for this treatment, the Court's opinion does not even have the questionable virtue of being politically correct. At a time when all society is trying to mainstream the mentally impaired, the Court permits them to be deprived of a basic constitutional right\u0097for their own good.</p>\n<p>Today's holding is extraordinarily vague. The Court does not accept Indiana's position that self-representation can be denied \"`where the defendant cannot communicate coherently with the court or a jury,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 2388. It does not even hold that Edwards was properly denied his right to represent himself. It holds only that lack of mental competence can under some circumstances form a basis for denying the right to proceed <i>pro se, ante,</i> at 2381-2382. We will presumably give some meaning to this holding in the future, but the indeterminacy makes a bad holding worse. Once the right of self-representation for the mentally ill is a sometime thing, trial judges will have every incentive to make their lives easier\u0097to avoid the painful necessity of deciphering occasional pleadings of the sort contained in the Appendix to today's opinion\u0097by appointing knowledgeable and literate counsel.</p>\n<p>Because I think a defendant who is competent to stand trial, and who is capable of knowing and voluntary waiver of assistance of counsel, has a constitutional right to conduct his own defense, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>",

EDWARDS\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIANA\n\n      No. 07\u2013208.      Argued March 26, 2008\u2014Decided June 19, 2008\nAfter Indiana charged respondent Edwards with attempted murder\n  and other crimes for a shooting during his attempt to steal a pair of\n  shoes, his mental condition became the subject of three competency\n  proceedings and two self-representation requests, mostly before the\n  same trial judge. Referring to the lengthy record of psychiatric re-\n  ports, the trial court noted that Edwards suffered from schizophrenia\n  and concluded that, although it appeared he was competent to stand\n  trial, he was not competent to defend himself at trial. The court\n  therefore denied Edwards\u2019 self-representation request. He was rep-\n  resented by appointed counsel at trial and convicted on two counts.\n  Indiana\u2019s intermediate appellate court ordered a new trial, agreeing\n  with Edwards that the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit him to represent\n  himself deprived him of his constitutional right of self-representation\n  under the Sixth Amendment and Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806.\n  Although finding that the record provided substantial support for the\n  trial court\u2019s ruling, the Indiana Supreme Court nonetheless affirmed\n  the intermediate appellate court on the ground that Faretta and\n  Godinez v. Moran, 509 U. S. 389, required the State to allow Edwards\n  to represent himself.\nHeld: The Constitution does not forbid States from insisting upon rep-\n resentation by counsel for those competent enough to stand trial but\n who suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not\n competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves. Pp. 4\u201313.\n    (a) This Court\u2019s precedents frame the question presented, but they\n do not answer it. Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S. 402, and Drope v.\n Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171, set forth the Constitution\u2019s \u201cmental\n competence\u201d standard forbidding the trial of an individual lacking a\n rational and factual understanding of the proceedings and sufficient\n ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational\n2                         INDIANA v. EDWARDS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    understanding. But those cases did not consider the issue presented\n    here, namely, the relation of that \u201cmental competence\u201d standard to\n    the self-representation right. Similarly the Court\u2019s foundational\n    \u201cself-representation\u201d case, Faretta, supra\u2014which held that the Sixth\n    and Fourteenth Amendments include a \u201cconstitutional right to pro-\n    ceed without counsel when\u201d a criminal defendant \u201cvoluntarily and in-\n    telligently elects to do so,\u201d 422 U. S., at 807\u2014does not answer the\n    question as to the scope of the self-representation right. Finally, al-\n    though Godinez, supra, presents a question closer to the one at issue\n    in that it focused upon a borderline-competent defendant who had\n    asked a state trial court to permit him to represent himself and to\n    change his pleas from not guilty to guilty, Godinez provides no an-\n    swer here because that defendant\u2019s ability to conduct a defense at\n    trial was expressly not at issue in that case, see 509 U. S., at 399\u2013\n    400, and because the case\u2019s constitutional holding that a State may\n    permit a gray-area defendant to represent himself does not tell a\n    State whether it may deny such a defendant the right to represent\n    himself at his trial. Pp. 4\u20138.\n       (b) Several considerations taken together lead the Court to con-\n    clude that the Constitution permits a State to limit a defendant\u2019s\n    self-representation right by insisting upon trial counsel when the de-\n    fendant lacks the mental competency to conduct his trial defense\n    unless represented. First, the Court\u2019s precedent, while not answering\n    the question, points slightly in that direction. By setting forth a\n    standard that focuses directly upon a defendant\u2019s ability to consult\n    with his lawyer, Dusky and Drope assume representation by counsel\n    and emphasize counsel\u2019s importance, thus suggesting (though not\n    holding) that choosing to forgo trial counsel presents a very different\n    set of circumstances than the mental competency determination for a\n    defendant to stand trial. Also, Faretta rested its self-representation\n    conclusion in part on pre-existing state cases that are consistent\n    with, and at least two of which expressly adopt, a competency limita-\n    tion on the self-representation right. See 422 U. S., at 813, and n. 9.\n    Second, the nature of mental illness\u2014which is not a unitary concept,\n    but varies in degree, can vary over time, and interferes with an indi-\n    vidual\u2019s functioning at different times in different ways\u2014cautions\n    against using a single competency standard to decide both whether a\n    defendant who is represented can proceed to trial and whether a de-\n    fendant who goes to trial must be permitted to represent himself.\n    Third, a self-representation right at trial will not \u201caffirm the dignity\u201d\n    of a defendant who lacks the mental capacity to conduct his defense\n    without the assistance of counsel, see McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S.\n    168, 176\u2013177, and may undercut the most basic of the Constitution\u2019s\n    criminal law objectives, providing a fair trial.

The\n  Court also declines Indiana\u2019s request to overrule Faretta because to-\n  day\u2019s opinion may well remedy the unfair trial concerns previously\n  leveled against the case.

We must decide whether in\nthese circumstances the Constitution forbids a State from\ninsisting that the defendant proceed to trial with counsel,\nthe State thereby denying the defendant the right to\nrepresent himself. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 6; Faretta v.\nCalifornia, 422 U. S. 806 (1975). We conclude that the\nConstitution does not forbid a State so to insist.\n                             I\n  In July 1999 Ahmad Edwards, the respondent, tried to\nsteal a pair of shoes from an Indiana department store.\nAfter he was discovered, he drew a gun, fired at a store\nsecurity officer, and wounded a bystander. He was caught\nand then charged with attempted murder, battery with a\ndeadly weapon, criminal recklessness, and theft. His\nmental condition subsequently became the subject of three\ncompetency proceedings and two self-representation re-\nquests, mostly before the same trial judge:\n  1. First Competency Hearing: August 2000.          Five\n2                  INDIANA v. EDWARDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmonths after Edwards\u2019 arrest, his court-appointed counsel\nasked for a psychiatric evaluation. After hearing psychia-\ntrist and neuropsychologist witnesses (in February 2000\nand again in August 2000), the court found Edwards\nincompetent to stand trial, App. 365a, and committed him\nto Logansport State Hospital for evaluation and treat-\nment, see id., at 48a\u201353a.\n   2. Second Competency Hearing: March 2002. Seven\nmonths after his commitment, doctors found that Ed-\nwards\u2019 condition had improved to the point where he could\nstand trial. Id., at 63a\u201364a. Several months later, how-\never, but still before trial, Edwards\u2019 counsel asked for\nanother psychiatric evaluation. In March 2002, the judge\nheld a competency hearing, considered additional psychi-\natric evidence, and (in April) found that Edwards, while\n\u201csuffer[ing] from mental illness,\u201d was \u201ccompetent to assist\nhis attorneys in his defense and stand trial for the charged\ncrimes.\u201d Id., at 114a.\n   3. Third Competency Hearing: April 2003.            Seven\nmonths later but still before trial, Edwards\u2019 counsel\nsought yet another psychiatric evaluation of his client.\nAnd, in April 2003, the court held yet another competency\nhearing. Edwards\u2019 counsel presented further psychiatric\nand neuropsychological evidence showing that Edwards\nwas suffering from serious thinking difficulties and delu-\nsions. A testifying psychiatrist reported that Edwards\ncould understand the charges against him, but he was\n\u201cunable to cooperate with his attorney in his defense\nbecause of his schizophrenic illness\u201d; \u201c[h]is delusions and\nhis marked difficulties in thinking make it impossible for\nhim to cooperate with his attorney.\u201d Id., at 164a. In\nNovember 2003, the court concluded that Edwards was\nnot then competent to stand trial and ordered his recom-\nmitment to the state hospital. Id., at 206a\u2013211a.\n   4. First Self-Representation Request and First Trial:\nJune 2005. About eight months after his commitment, the\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhospital reported that Edwards\u2019 condition had again im-\nproved to the point that he had again become competent to\nstand trial. Id., at 228a\u2013236a. And almost one year after\nthat Edwards\u2019 trial began. Just before trial, Edwards\nasked to represent himself. Id., at 509a, 520a. He also\nasked for a continuance, which, he said, he needed in\norder to proceed pro se. Id., at 519a\u2013520a. The court\nrefused the continuance. Id., at 520a. Edwards then\nproceeded to trial represented by counsel. The jury con-\nvicted him of criminal recklessness and theft but failed to\nreach a verdict on the charges of attempted murder and\nbattery.\n   5. Second Self-Representation Request and Second\nTrial: December 2005. The State decided to retry Edwards\non the attempted murder and battery charges. Just before\nthe retrial, Edwards again asked the court to permit him\nto represent himself. Id., at 279a\u2013282a. Referring to the\nlengthy record of psychiatric reports, the trial court noted\nthat Edwards still suffered from schizophrenia and con-\ncluded that \u201c[w]ith these findings, he\u2019s competent to stand\ntrial but I\u2019m not going to find he\u2019s competent to defend\nhimself.\u201d Id., at 527a. The court denied Edwards\u2019 self-\nrepresentation request. Edwards was represented by\nappointed counsel at his retrial. The jury convicted Ed-\nwards on both of the remaining counts.\n   Edwards subsequently appealed to Indiana\u2019s intermedi-\nate appellate court. He argued that the trial court\u2019s re-\nfusal to permit him to represent himself at his retrial\ndeprived him of his constitutional right of self-\nrepresentation. U. S. Const., Amdt. 6; Faretta, supra. The\ncourt agreed and ordered a new trial. The matter then\nwent to the Indiana Supreme Court. That court found\nthat \u201c[t]he record in this case presents a substantial basis\nto agree with the trial court,\u201d 866 N. E. 2d 252, 260 (2007),\nbut it nonetheless affirmed the intermediate appellate\ncourt on the belief that this Court\u2019s precedents, namely,\n4                  INDIANA v. EDWARDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFaretta, 422 U. S. 806, and Godinez v. Moran, 509 U. S.\n389 (1993), required the State to allow Edwards to repre-\nsent himself. At Indiana\u2019s request, we agreed to consider\nwhether the Constitution required the trial court to allow\nEdwards to represent himself at trial.\n                             II\n   Our examination of this Court\u2019s precedents convinces us\nthat those precedents frame the question presented, but\nthey do not answer it. The two cases that set forth the\nConstitution\u2019s \u201cmental competence\u201d standard, Dusky v.\nUnited States, 362 U. S. 402 (1960) (per curiam), and\nDrope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162 (1975), specify that the\nConstitution does not permit trial of an individual who\nlacks \u201cmental competency.\u201d Dusky defines the competency\nstandard as including both (1) \u201cwhether\u201d the defendant\nhas \u201ca rational as well as factual understanding of the\nproceedings against him\u201d and (2) whether the defendant\n\u201chas sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer\nwith a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\u201d 362\nU. S., at 402 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks\nomitted). Drope repeats that standard, stating that it \u201chas\nlong been accepted that a person whose mental condition\nis such that he lacks the capacity to understand the na-\nture and object of the proceedings against him, to consult\nwith counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may\nnot be subjected to a trial.\u201d 420 U. S., at 171 (emphasis\nadded). Neither case considered the mental competency\nissue presented here, namely, the relation of the mental\ncompetence standard to the right of self-representation.\n   The Court\u2019s foundational \u201cself-representation\u201d case,\nFaretta, held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments\ninclude a \u201cconstitutional right to proceed without counsel\nwhen\u201d a criminal defendant \u201cvoluntarily and intelligently\nelects to do so.\u201d 422 U. S., at 807 (emphasis in original).\nThe Court implied that right from: (1) a \u201cnearly universal\n                   Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)               5\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nconviction,\u201d made manifest in state law, that \u201cforcing a\nlawyer upon an unwilling defendant is contrary to his\nbasic right to defend himself if he truly wants to do so,\u201d\nid., at 817\u2013818; (2) Sixth Amendment language granting\nrights to the \u201caccused;\u201d (3) Sixth Amendment structure\nindicating that the rights it sets forth, related to the \u201cfair\nadministration of American justice,\u201d are \u201cpersona[l]\u201d to the\naccused, id., at 818\u2013821; (4) the absence of historical\nexamples of forced representation, id., at 821\u2013832; and (5)\n\u201c \u2018respect for the individual,\u2019 \u201d id., at 834 (quoting Illinois v.\nAllen, 397 U. S. 337, 350\u2013351 (1970) (Brennan, J., concur-\nring) (a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel \u201cmust\nbe honored out of \u2018that respect for the individual which is\nthe lifeblood of the law\u2019 \u201d)).\n    Faretta does not answer the question before us both\nbecause it did not consider the problem of mental compe-\ntency (cf. 422 U. S., at 835 (Faretta was \u201cliterate, compe-\ntent, and understanding\u201d)), and because Faretta itself and\nlater cases have made clear that the right of self-\nrepresentation is not absolute. See Martinez v. Court of\nAppeal of Cal., Fourth Appellate Dist., 528 U. S. 152, 163\n(2000) (no right of self-representation on direct appeal in a\ncriminal case); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168, 178\u2013\n179 (1984) (appointment of standby counsel over self-\nrepresented defendant\u2019s objection is permissible); Faretta,\n422 U. S., at 835, n. 46 (no right \u201cto abuse the dignity of\nthe courtroom\u201d); ibid. (no right to avoid compliance with\n\u201crelevant rules of procedural and substantive law\u201d); id., at\n834, n. 46 (no right to \u201cengag[e] in serious and obstruction-\nist misconduct,\u201d referring to Illinois v. Allen, supra). The\nquestion here concerns a mental-illness-related limitation\non the scope of the self-representation right.\n    The sole case in which this Court considered mental\ncompetence and self-representation together, Godinez,\nsupra, presents a question closer to that at issue here.\nThe case focused upon a borderline-competent criminal\n6                  INDIANA v. EDWARDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndefendant who had asked a state trial court to permit him\nto represent himself and to change his pleas from not\nguilty to guilty. The state trial court had found that the\ndefendant met Dusky\u2019s mental competence standard, that\nhe \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d waived his right to assis-\ntance of counsel, and that he \u201cfreely and voluntarily\u201d chose\nto plead guilty. 509 U. S., at 393 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). And the state trial court had conse-\nquently granted the defendant\u2019s self-representation and\nchange-of-plea requests. See id., at 392\u2013393. A federal\nappeals court, however, had vacated the defendant\u2019s guilty\npleas on the ground that the Constitution required the\ntrial court to ask a further question, namely, whether the\ndefendant was competent to waive his constitutional right\nto counsel. See id., at 393\u2013394. Competence to make that\nlatter decision, the appeals court said, required the defen-\ndant to satisfy a higher mental competency standard than\nthe standard set forth in Dusky. See 509 U. S., at 393\u2013\n394. Dusky\u2019s more general standard sought only to deter-\nmine whether a defendant represented by counsel was\ncompetent to stand trial, not whether he was competent to\nwaive his right to counsel. 509 U. S., at 394\u2013395.\n   This Court, reversing the Court of Appeals, \u201creject[ed]\nthe notion that competence to plead guilty or to waive the\nright to counsel must be measured by a standard that is\nhigher than (or even different from) the Dusky standard.\u201d\nId., at 398. The decision to plead guilty, we said, \u201cis no\nmore complicated than the sum total of decisions that a\n[represented] defendant may be called upon to make\nduring the course of a trial.\u201d Ibid. Hence \u201cthere is no\nreason to believe that the decision to waive counsel re-\nquires an appreciably higher level of mental functioning\nthan the decision to waive other constitutional rights.\u201d\nId., at 399. And even assuming that self-representation\nmight pose special trial-related difficulties, \u201cthe compe-\ntence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nright to counsel is the competence to waive the right, not\nthe competence to represent himself.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis in\noriginal). For this reason, we concluded, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s\n\u2018technical legal knowledge\u2019 is \u2018not relevant\u2019 to the determi-\nnation.\u201d Id., at 400 (quoting Faretta, supra, at 836).\n   We concede that Godinez bears certain similarities with\nthe present case. Both involve mental competence and\nself-representation. Both involve a defendant who wants\nto represent himself. Both involve a mental condition that\nfalls in a gray area between Dusky\u2019s minimal constitu-\ntional requirement that measures a defendant\u2019s ability to\nstand trial and a somewhat higher standard that meas-\nures mental fitness for another legal purpose.\n   We nonetheless conclude that Godinez does not answer\nthe question before us now. In part that is because the\nCourt of Appeals higher standard at issue in Godinez\ndiffers in a critical way from the higher standard at issue\nhere. In Godinez, the higher standard sought to measure\nthe defendant\u2019s ability to proceed on his own to enter a\nguilty plea; here the higher standard seeks to measure the\ndefendant\u2019s ability to conduct trial proceedings. To put\nthe matter more specifically, the Godinez defendant\nsought only to change his pleas to guilty, he did not seek\nto conduct trial proceedings, and his ability to conduct a\ndefense at trial was expressly not at issue. Thus we em-\nphasized in Godinez that we needed to consider only the\ndefendant\u2019s \u201ccompetence to waive the right.\u201d 509 U. S., at\n399 (emphasis in original). And we further emphasized\nthat we need not consider the defendant\u2019s \u201ctechnical legal\nknowledge\u201d about how to proceed at trial. Id., at 400\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We found our holding\nconsistent with this Court\u2019s earlier statement in Massey v.\nMoore, 348 U. S. 105, 108 (1954), that \u201c[o]ne might not be\ninsane in the sense of being incapable of standing trial and\nyet lack the capacity to stand trial without benefit of\ncounsel.\u201d See Godinez, supra, at 399\u2013400, n. 10 (quoting\n8                  INDIANA v. EDWARDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMassey and noting that it dealt with \u201ca question that is\nquite different from the question presented\u201d in Godinez).\nIn this case, the very matters that we did not consider in\nGodinez are directly before us.\n  For another thing, Godinez involved a State that sought\nto permit a gray-area defendant to represent himself.\nGodinez\u2019s constitutional holding is that a State may do so.\nBut that holding simply does not tell a State whether it\nmay deny a gray-area defendant the right to represent\nhimself\u2014the matter at issue here. One might argue that\nGodinez\u2019s grant (to a State) of permission to allow a gray-\narea defendant self-representation must implicitly include\npermission to deny self-representation. Cf. 509 U. S., at\n402 (\u201cStates are free to adopt competency standards that\nare more elaborate than the Dusky formulation\u201d). Yet one\ncould more forcefully argue that Godinez simply did not\nconsider whether the Constitution requires self-\nrepresentation by gray-area defendants even in circum-\nstances where the State seeks to disallow it (the question\nhere). The upshot is that, in our view, the question before\nus is an open one.\n                            III\n   We now turn to the question presented. We assume\nthat a criminal defendant has sufficient mental compe-\ntence to stand trial (i.e., the defendant meets Dusky\u2019s\nstandard) and that the defendant insists on representing\nhimself during that trial. We ask whether the Constitu-\ntion permits a State to limit that defendant\u2019s self-\nrepresentation right by insisting upon representation by\ncounsel at trial\u2014on the ground that the defendant lacks\nthe mental capacity to conduct his trial defense unless\nrepresented.\n   Several considerations taken together lead us to con-\nclude that the answer to this question is yes. First, the\nCourt\u2019s precedent, while not answering the question,\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npoints slightly in the direction of our affirmative answer.\nGodinez, as we have just said, simply leaves the question\nopen. But the Court\u2019s \u201cmental competency\u201d cases set forth\na standard that focuses directly upon a defendant\u2019s \u201cpre-\nsent ability to consult with his lawyer,\u201d Dusky, 362 U. S.,\nat 402 (internal quotation marks omitted); a \u201ccapacity . . .\nto consult with counsel,\u201d and an ability \u201cto assist [counsel]\nin preparing his defense,\u201d Drope, 420 U. S., at 171. See\nibid. (\u201cIt has long been accepted that a person whose\nmental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to\nunderstand the nature and object of the proceedings\nagainst him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in pre-\nparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial\u201d (em-\nphasis added)). These standards assume representation\nby counsel and emphasize the importance of counsel.\nThey thus suggest (though do not hold) that an instance in\nwhich a defendant who would choose to forgo counsel at\ntrial presents a very different set of circumstances, which\nin our view, calls for a different standard.\n   At the same time Faretta, the foundational self-\nrepresentation case, rested its conclusion in part upon pre-\nexisting state law set forth in cases all of which are consis-\ntent with, and at least two of which expressly adopt, a\ncompetency limitation on the self-representation right.\nSee 422 U. S., at 813, and n. 9 (citing 16 state-court deci-\nsions and two secondary sources). See, e.g., Cappetta v.\nState, 204 So. 2d 913, 917\u2013918 (Fla. App. 1967), rev\u2019d on\nother grounds, 216 So. 2d 749 (Fla. 1968), cited in Faretta,\nsupra, at 813, n. 9 (assuring a \u201cmentally competent\u201d de-\nfendant the right \u201cto conduct his own defense\u201d provided\nthat \u201cno unusual circumstances exist\u201d such as, e.g., \u201cmen-\ntal derangement\u201d that \u201cwould . . . depriv[e]\u201d the defendant\n\u201cof a fair trial if allowed to conduct his own defense,\u201d 204\nSo. 2d, at 917\u2013918); id., at 918 (noting that \u201cwhether\nunusual circumstances are evident is a matter resting in\nthe sound discretion granted to the trial judge\u201d); Allen v.\n10                 INDIANA v. EDWARDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCommonwealth, 324 Mass. 558, 562\u2013563, 87 N. E. 2d 192,\n195 (1949) (noting \u201cthe assignment of counsel\u201d was \u201cneces-\nsary\u201d where there was some \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d such\nas when the criminal defendant was \u201cmentally defective\u201d).\n   Second, the nature of the problem before us cautions\nagainst the use of a single mental competency standard for\ndeciding both (1) whether a defendant who is represented\nby counsel can proceed to trial and (2) whether a defen-\ndant who goes to trial must be permitted to represent\nhimself. Mental illness itself is not a unitary concept. It\nvaries in degree. It can vary over time. It interferes with\nan individual\u2019s functioning at different times in different\nways. The history of this case (set forth in Part I, supra)\nillustrates the complexity of the problem. In certain in-\nstances an individual may well be able to satisfy Dusky\u2019s\nmental competence standard, for he will be able to work\nwith counsel at trial, yet at the same time he may be\nunable to carry out the basic tasks needed to present his\nown defense without the help of counsel. See, e.g., N.\nPoythress, R. Bonnie, J. Monahan, R. Otto, & S. Hoge,\nAdjudicative Competence: The MacArthur Studies 103\n(2002) (\u201cWithin each domain of adjudicative competence\n(competence to assist counsel; decisional competence) the\ndata indicate that understanding, reasoning, and appre-\nciation [of the charges against a defendant] are separable\nand somewhat independent aspects of functional legal\nability\u201d).

McKaskle, supra, at 176\u2013177 (\u201cDignity\u201d\nand \u201cautonomy\u201d of individual underlie self-representation\nright). To the contrary, given that defendant\u2019s uncertain\nmental state, the spectacle that could well result from his\nself-representation at trial is at least as likely to prove\nhumiliating as ennobling. Moreover, insofar as a defen-\ndant\u2019s lack of capacity threatens an improper conviction or\nsentence, self-representation in that exceptional context\nundercuts the most basic of the Constitution\u2019s criminal\nlaw objectives, providing a fair trial. As Justice Brennan\nput it, \u201c[t]he Constitution would protect none of us if it\nprevented the courts from acting to preserve the very\nprocesses that the Constitution itself prescribes.\u201d Allen,\n397 U. S., at 350 (concurring opinion). See Martinez, 528\nU. S., at 162 (\u201cEven at the trial level . . . the government\u2019s\ninterest in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the trial\nat times outweighs the defendant\u2019s interest in acting as\nhis own lawyer\u201d). See also Sell v. United States, 539 U.

United\nStates, 486 U. S. 153, 160 (1988).

EDWARDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndefense: \u201c[H]ow in the world can our legal system allow an\ninsane man to defend himself?\u201d Brief for Ohio et al. as\nAmici Curiae 24 (internal quotation marks omitted). See\nMassey, 348 U. S., at 108 (\u201cNo trial can be fair that leaves\nthe defense to a man who is insane, unaided by counsel,\nand who by reason of his mental condition stands helpless\nand alone before the court\u201d). The application of Dusky\u2019s\nbasic mental competence standard can help in part to\navoid this result. But given the different capacities\nneeded to proceed to trial without counsel, there is little\nreason to believe that Dusky alone is sufficient. At the\nsame time, the trial judge, particularly one such as the\ntrial judge in this case, who presided over one of Edwards\u2019\ncompetency hearings and his two trials, will often prove\nbest able to make more fine-tuned mental capacity deci-\nsions, tailored to the individualized circumstances of a\nparticular defendant.\n   We consequently conclude that the Constitution permits\njudges to take realistic account of the particular defen-\ndant\u2019s mental capacities by asking whether a defendant\nwho seeks to conduct his own defense at trial is mentally\ncompetent to do so. That is to say, the Constitution per-\nmits States to insist upon representation by counsel for\nthose competent enough to stand trial under Dusky but\nwho still suffer from severe mental illness to the point\nwhere they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings\nby themselves.\n                            IV\n  Indiana has also asked us to adopt, as a measure of a\ndefendant\u2019s ability to conduct a trial, a more specific stan-\ndard that would \u201cdeny a criminal defendant the right to\nrepresent himself at trial where the defendant cannot\ncommunicate coherently with the court or a jury.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 20 (emphasis deleted). We are sufficiently\nuncertain, however, as to how that particular standard\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwould work in practice to refrain from endorsing it as a\nfederal constitutional standard here. We need not now,\nand we do not, adopt it.\n   Indiana has also asked us to overrule Faretta. We\ndecline to do so. We recognize that judges have sometimes\nexpressed concern that Faretta, contrary to its intent, has\nled to trials that are unfair. See Martinez, supra, at 164\n(BREYER, J., concurring) (noting practical concerns of trial\njudges). But recent empirical research suggests that such\ninstances are not common. See, e.g., Hashimoto, Defend-\ning the Right of Self-Representation: An Empirical Look at\nthe Pro Se Felony Defendant, 85 N. C. L. Rev. 423, 427,\n447, 428 (2007) (noting that of the small number of defen-\ndants who chose to proceed pro se\u2014\u201croughly 0.3% to 0.5%\u201d\nof the total, state felony defendants in particular \u201cappear\nto have achieved higher felony acquittal rates than their\nrepresented counterparts in that they were less likely to\nhave been convicted of felonies\u201d). At the same time, in-\nstances in which the trial\u2019s fairness is in doubt may well\nbe concentrated in the 20 percent or so of self-\nrepresentation cases where the mental competence of the\ndefendant is also at issue. See id., at 428 (about 20 per-\ncent of federal pro se felony defendants ordered to undergo\ncompetency evaluations). If so, today\u2019s opinion, assuring\ntrial judges the authority to deal appropriately with cases\nin the latter category, may well alleviate those fair trial\nconcerns.\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Supreme Court\nof Indiana is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n                                                So ordered.\n14                   INDIANA v.

Faretta v. California, 422\nU. S. 806 (1975). A mentally ill defendant who knowingly\nand voluntarily elects to proceed pro se instead of through\ncounsel receives a fair trial that comports with the Four-\nteenth Amendment. Godinez v. Moran, 509 U. S. 389\n(1993). The Court today concludes that a State may none-\ntheless strip a mentally ill defendant of the right to repre-\nsent himself when that would be fairer. In my view the\nConstitution does not permit a State to substitute its own\nperception of fairness for the defendant\u2019s right to make his\nown case before the jury\u2014a specific right long understood\nas essential to a fair trial.\n                              I\n  Ahmad Edwards suffers from schizophrenia, an illness\nthat has manifested itself in different ways over time,\ndepending on how and whether Edwards was treated as\nwell as on other factors that appear harder to identify. In\nthe years between 2000 and 2003\u2014years in which Ed-\nwards was apparently not treated with the antipsychotic\nmedications and other drugs that are commonly pre-\nscribed for his illness\u2014Edwards was repeatedly declared\n2                  INDIANA v. EDWARDS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nincompetent to stand trial. Even during this period, how-\never, his mental state seems to have fluctuated. For\ninstance, one psychiatrist in March 2001 described Ed-\nwards in a competency report as \u201cfree of psychosis, depres-\nsion, mania, and confusion,\u201d \u201calert, oriented, [and] appro-\npriate,\u201d apparently \u201cable to think clearly\u201d and apparently\n\u201cpsychiatrically normal.\u201d App. 61a.\n   Edwards seems to have been treated with antipsychotic\nmedication for the first time in 2004. He was found com-\npetent to stand trial the same year. The psychiatrist\nmaking the recommendation described Edwards\u2019 thought\nprocesses as \u201ccoherent\u201d and wrote that he \u201ccommuni-\ncate[d] very well,\u201d that his speech was \u201ceasy to under-\nstand,\u201d that he displayed \u201cgood communications skills,\ncooperative attitude, average intelligence, and good cogni-\ntive functioning,\u201d that he could \u201cappraise the roles of the\nparticipants in the courtroom proceedings,\u201d and that he\nhad the capacity to challenge prosecution witnesses realis-\ntically and to testify relevantly. Id., at 232a\u2013235a (report\nof Dr. Robert Sena).\n   Over the course of what became two separate criminal\ntrials, Edwards sought to act as his own lawyer. He filed a\nnumber of incoherent written pleadings with the judge on\nwhich the Court places emphasis, but he also filed several\nintelligible pleadings, such as a motion to dismiss counsel,\na motion to dismiss charges under the Indiana speedy trial\nprovision, and a motion seeking a trial transcript.\n   Edwards made arguments in the courtroom that were\nmore coherent than his written pleadings. In seeking to\nrepresent himself at his first trial, Edwards complained in\ndetail that the attorney representing him had not spent\nadequate time preparing and was not sharing legal mate-\nrials for use in his defense. The trial judge concluded that\nEdwards had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right\nto counsel and proceeded to quiz Edwards about matters of\nstate law. Edwards correctly answered questions about\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

He persisted in his request to represent himself,\nbut the judge denied the request because Edwards ac-\nknowledged he would need a continuance. Represented by\ncounsel, he was convicted of criminal recklessness and\ntheft, but the jury deadlocked on charges of attempted\nmurder and battery.\n  At his second trial, Edwards again asked the judge to be\nallowed to proceed pro se. He explained that he and his\nattorney disagreed about which defense to present to the\nattempted murder charge. Edwards\u2019 counsel favored lack\nof intent to kill; Edwards, self-defense. As the defendant\nput it: \u201cMy objection is me and my attorney actually had\ndiscussed a defense, I think prosecution had mentioned\nthat, and we are in disagreement with it. He has a de-\nfense and I have a defense that I would like to represent\nor present to the Judge.\u201d Id., at 523a.\n  The court again rejected Edwards\u2019 request to proceed\npro se, and this time it did not have the justification that\nEdwards had sought a continuance. The court did not\ndispute that Edwards knowingly and intelligently waived\nhis right to counsel, but stated it was \u201cgoing to carve out a\nthird exception\u201d to the right of self-representation, and\u2014\nwithout explaining precisely what abilities Edwards\nlacked\u2014stated Edwards was \u201ccompetent to stand trial but\nI\u2019m not going to find he\u2019s competent to defend himself.\u201d\nId., at 527a. Edwards sought\u2014by a request through\ncounsel and by raising an objection in open court\u2014to\naddress the judge on the matter, but the judge refused,\nstating that the issue had already been decided. Edwards\u2019\ncourt-appointed attorney pursued the defense the attorney\njudged best\u2014lack of intent, not self-defense\u2014and Ed-\n4                   INDIANA v.

S.,\nat 807. The right reflects \u201ca nearly universal conviction,\non the part of our people as well as our courts, that forcing\na lawyer upon an unwilling defendant is contrary to his\nbasic right to defend himself if he truly wants to do so.\u201d\nId., at 817. Faretta\u2019s discussion of the history of the right,\nid., at 821\u2013833, includes the observation that \u201c[i]n the long\nhistory of British criminal jurisprudence, there was only\none tribunal that ever adopted a practice of forcing counsel\nupon an unwilling defendant in a criminal proceeding.\nThe tribunal was the Star Chamber,\u201d id., at 821. Faretta\ndescribed the right to proceed pro se as a premise of the\nSixth Amendment, which confers the tools for a defense on\nthe \u201caccused,\u201d and describes the role of the attorney as one\nof \u201cassistance.\u201d The right of self-representation could also\nbe seen as a part of the traditional meaning of the Due\nProcess Clause. See Martinez v. Court of Appeal of Cal.,\nFourth Appellate Dist., 528 U. S. 152, 165 (2000) (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in judgment). Whichever provision provides\nits source, it means that a State simply may not force a\nlawyer upon a criminal defendant who wishes to conduct\nhis own defense. Faretta, 422 U. S., at 807.\n   Exercising the right of self-representation requires\nwaiving the right to counsel. A defendant may represent\nhimself only when he \u201c \u2018knowingly and intelligently\u2019 \u201d\nwaives the lawyer\u2019s assistance that is guaranteed by the\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

He must \u201cbe made aware\nof the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation,\u201d\nand the record must \u201cestablish that \u2018he knows what he is\ndoing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quot-\ning Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269,\n279 (1942)). This limitation may be relevant to many\nmentally ill defendants, but there is no dispute that Ed-\nwards was not one of them. Edwards was warned exten-\nsively of the risks of proceeding pro se. The trial judge\nfound that Edwards had \u201cknowingly and voluntarily\u201d\nwaived his right to counsel at his first trial, App. 512a,\nand at his second trial the judge denied him the right to\nrepresent himself only by \u201ccarv[ing] out\u201d a new \u201cexception\u201d\nto the right beyond the standard of knowing and voluntary\nwaiver, id., at 527a.\n   When a defendant appreciates the risks of forgoing\ncounsel and chooses to do so voluntarily, the Constitution\nprotects his ability to present his own defense even when\nthat harms his case. In fact waiving counsel \u201cusually\u201d\ndoes so. McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168, 177, n. 8\n(1984); see also Faretta, 422 U. S., at 834. We have none-\ntheless said that the defendant\u2019s \u201cchoice must be honored\nout of \u2018that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood\nof the law.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. What the Constitution requires is not\nthat a State\u2019s case be subject to the most rigorous adver-\nsarial testing possible\u2014after all, it permits a defendant to\neliminate all adversarial testing by pleading guilty. What\nthe Constitution requires is that a defendant be given the\nright to challenge the State\u2019s case against him using the\narguments he sees fit.\n   In Godinez, 509 U. S. 389, we held that the Due Process\nClause posed no barrier to permitting a defendant who\nsuffered from mental illness both to waive his right to\ncounsel and to plead guilty, so long as he was competent to\nstand trial and knowingly and voluntarily waived trial\nand the counsel right. Id., at 391, 400. It was \u201cnever the\n6                  INDIANA v. EDWARDS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nrule at common law\u201d that a defendant could be competent\nto stand trial and yet incompetent to either exercise or\ngive up some of the rights provided for his defense. Id., at\n404 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). We rejected the invitation to craft a higher\ncompetency standard for waiving counsel than for stand-\ning trial. That proposal, we said, was built on the \u201cflawed\npremise\u201d that a defendant\u2019s \u201ccompetence to represent\nhimself\u201d was the relevant measure: \u201c[T]he competence\nthat is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right\nto counsel is the competence to waive the right, not the\ncompetence to represent himself.\u201d Id., at 399. We\ngrounded this on Faretta\u2019s candid acknowledgment that\nthe Sixth Amendment protected the defendant\u2019s right to\nconduct a defense to his disadvantage. 509 U. S. at 399\u2013\n400.\n                              B\n   The Court is correct that this case presents a variation\non Godinez: It presents the question not whether another\nconstitutional requirement (in Godinez, the proposed\nhigher degree of competence required for a waiver) limits\na defendant\u2019s constitutional right to elect self-\nrepresentation, but whether a State\u2019s view of fairness (or\nof other values) permits it to strip the defendant of this\nright. But that makes the question before us an easier\none. While one constitutional requirement must yield to\nanother in case of conflict, nothing permits a State, be-\ncause of its view of what is fair, to deny a constitutional\nprotection. Although \u201cthe purpose of the rights set forth in\n[the Sixth] Amendment is to ensure a fair trial,\u201d it \u201cdoes\nnot follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the\ntrial is, on the whole, fair.\u201d United States v. Gonzalez-\nLopez, 548 U. S. 140, 145 (2006).

S. 36, 61 (2004).\nWe have rejected an approach to individual liberties that\n\u201c \u2018abstracts from the right to its purposes, and then elimi-\nnates the right.\u2019 \u201d Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 145 (quoting\nMaryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 862 (1990) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting)).\n    Until today, the right of self-representation has been\naccorded the same respect as other constitutional guaran-\ntees. The only circumstance in which we have permitted\nthe State to deprive a defendant of this trial right is the\none under which we have allowed the State to deny other\nsuch rights: when it is necessary to enable the trial to\nproceed in an orderly fashion. That overriding necessity,\nwe have said, justifies forfeiture of even the Sixth\nAmendment right to be present at trial\u2014if, after being\nthreatened with removal, a defendant \u201cinsists on conduct-\ning himself in a manner so disorderly, disruptive, and\ndisrespectful of the court that his trial cannot be carried\non with him in the courtroom.\u201d Illinois v. Allen, 397 U. S.\n337, 343 (1970). A pro se defendant may not \u201cabuse the\ndignity of the courtroom,\u201d nor may he fail to \u201ccomply with\nrelevant rules of procedural and substantive law,\u201d and a\ncourt may \u201cterminate\u201d the self-representation of a defen-\ndant who \u201cdeliberately engages in serious and obstruction-\nist misconduct.\u201d Faretta, supra, at 834\u2013835, n. 46. This\nground for terminating self-representation is unavailable\nhere, however, because Edwards was not even allowed to\nbegin to represent himself, and because he was respectful\nand compliant and did not provide a basis to conclude a\ntrial could not have gone forward had he been allowed to\npress his own claims.\n    Beyond this circumstance, we have never constrained\nthe ability of a defendant to retain \u201cactual control over the\ncase he chooses to present to the jury\u201d\u2014what we have\ntermed \u201cthe core of the Faretta right.\u201d Wiggins, supra, at\n8                   INDIANA v. EDWARDS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n178. Thus, while Faretta recognized that the right of self-\nrepresentation does not bar the court from appointing\nstandby counsel, we explained in Wiggins that \u201c[t]he pro se\ndefendant must be allowed to control the organization and\ncontent of his own defense, to make motions, to argue\npoints of law, to participate in voir dire, to question wit-\nnesses, and to address the court and the jury at appropri-\nate points in the trial.\u201d 465 U. S., at 174. Furthermore,\nbecause \u201cmultiple voices \u2018for the defense\u2019 \u201d could \u201cconfuse\nthe message the defendant wishes to convey,\u201d id., at 177, a\nstandby attorney\u2019s participation would be barred when it\nwould \u201cdestroy the jury\u2019s perception that the defendant is\nrepresenting himself,\u201d id., at 178.\n  As I have explained, I would not adopt an approach to\nthe right of self-representation that we have squarely\nrejected for other rights\u2014allowing courts to disregard the\nright when doing so serves the purposes for which the\nright was intended. But if I were to adopt such an ap-\nproach, I would remain in dissent, because I believe the\nCourt\u2019s assessment of the purposes of the right of self-\nrepresentation is inaccurate to boot. While there is little\ndoubt that preserving individual \u201c \u2018dignity\u2019 \u201d (to which the\nCourt refers), ante, at 11, is paramount among those\npurposes, there is equally little doubt that the loss of\n\u201cdignity\u201d the right is designed to prevent is not the defen-\ndant\u2019s making a fool of himself by presenting an amateur-\nish or even incoherent defense. Rather, the dignity at\nissue is the supreme human dignity of being master of\none\u2019s fate rather than a ward of the State\u2014the dignity of\nindividual choice.     Faretta explained that the Sixth\nAmendment\u2019s counsel clause should not be invoked to\nimpair \u201c \u2018the exercise of [the defendant\u2019s] free choice\u2019 \u201d to\ndispense with the right, 422 U. S., at 815 (quoting Adams,\n317 U. S., at 280); for \u201cwhatever else may be said of those\nwho wrote the Bill of Rights, surely there can be no doubt\nthat they understood the inestimable worth of free choice,\u201d\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)             9\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n422 U. S., at 833\u2013834. Nine years later, when we wrote in\nWiggins that the self-representation right served the\n\u201cdignity and autonomy of the accused,\u201d 465 U. S., at 177,\nwe explained in no uncertain terms that this meant ac-\ncording every defendant the right to his say in court. In\nparticular, we said that individual dignity and autonomy\nbarred standby counsel from participating in a manner\nthat would \u201cdestroy the jury\u2019s perception that the de-\nfendant is representing himself,\u201d and meant that \u201cthe pro\nse defendant is entitled to preserve actual control over the\ncase he chooses to present to the jury.\u201d Id., at 178. In\nsum, if the Court is to honor the particular conception of\n\u201cdignity\u201d that underlies the self-representation right, it\nshould respect the autonomy of the individual by honoring\nhis choices knowingly and voluntarily made.\n  A further purpose that the Court finds is advanced by\ndenial of the right of self-representation is the purpose of\nassuring that trials \u201cappear fair to all who observe them.\u201d\nAnte, at 11. To my knowledge we have never denied a\ndefendant a right simply on the ground that it would make\nhis trial appear less \u201cfair\u201d to outside observers, and I\nwould not inaugurate that principle here. But were I to do\nso, I would not apply it to deny a defendant the right to\nrepresent himself when he knowingly and voluntarily\nwaives counsel. When Edwards stood to say that \u201cI have a\ndefense that I would like to represent or present to the\nJudge,\u201d App. 523a, it seems to me the epitome of both\nactual and apparent unfairness for the judge to say, I have\nheard \u201cyour desire to proceed by yourself and I\u2019ve denied\nyour request, so your attorney will speak for you from now\non,\u201d id., at 530a.\n                              III\n   It may be that the Court permits a State to deprive\nmentally ill defendants of a historic component of a fair\ntrial because it is suspicious of the constitutional footing of\n10                  INDIANA v. EDWARDS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe right of self-representation itself. The right is not\nexplicitly set forth in the text of the Sixth Amendment,\nand some Members of this Court have expressed skepti-\ncism about Faretta\u2019s holding. See Martinez, supra, at 156\u2013\n158 (questioning relevance of historical evidence underly-\ning Faretta\u2019s holding); 528 U. S., at 164 (BREYER, J., con-\ncurring) (noting \u201cjudges closer to the firing line have some-\ntimes expressed dismay about the practical consequences\u201d\nof the right of self-representation).\n   While the Sixth Amendment makes no mention of the\nright to forgo counsel, it provides the defendant, and not\nhis lawyer, the right to call witnesses in his defense and to\nconfront witnesses against him, and counsel is permitted\nto assist in \u201chis defence\u201d (emphasis added). Our trial\nsystem, however, allows the attorney representing a de-\nfendant \u201cfull authority to manage the conduct of the\ntrial\u201d\u2014an authority without which \u201c[t]he adversary proc-\ness could not function effectively.\u201d Taylor v. Illinois, 484\nU. S. 400, 418 (1988); see also Florida v. Nixon, 543 U. S.\n175, 187 (2004). We have held that \u201cthe client must accept\nthe consequences of the lawyer\u2019s decision to forgo cross-\nexamination, to decide not to put certain witnesses on the\nstand, or to decide not to disclose the identity of certain\nwitnesses in advance of trial.\u201d Taylor, supra, at 418.\nThus, in order for the defendant\u2019s right to call his own\nwitnesses, to cross-examine witnesses, and to put on a\ndefense to be anything more than \u201ca tenuous and unac-\nceptable legal fiction,\u201d a defendant must have consented to\nthe representation of counsel. Faretta, supra, at 821.\nOtherwise, \u201cthe defense presented is not the defense guar-\nanteed him by the Constitution, for in a very real sense, it\nis not his defense.\u201d Ibid.\n   The facts of this case illustrate this point with the ut-\nmost clarity. Edwards wished to take a self-defense case\nto the jury. His counsel preferred a defense that focused\non lack of intent. Having been denied the right to conduct\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nhis own defense, Edwards was convicted without having\nhad the opportunity to present to the jury the grounds he\nbelieved supported his innocence. I do not doubt that he\nlikely would have been convicted anyway. But to hold that\na defendant may be deprived of the right to make legal\narguments for acquittal simply because a state-selected\nagent has made different arguments on his behalf is, as\nJustice Frankfurter wrote in Adams, supra, at 280, to\n\u201cimprison a man in his privileges and call it the Constitu-\ntion.\u201d In singling out mentally ill defendants for this\ntreatment, the Court\u2019s opinion does not even have the\nquestionable virtue of being politically correct. At a time\nwhen all society is trying to mainstream the mentally\nimpaired, the Court permits them to be deprived of a basic\nconstitutional right\u2014for their own good.\n   Today\u2019s holding is extraordinarily vague. The Court\ndoes not accept Indiana\u2019s position that self-representation\ncan be denied \u201c \u2018where the defendant cannot communicate\ncoherently with the court or a jury,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 12. It does\nnot even hold that Edwards was properly denied his right\nto represent himself. It holds only that lack of mental\ncompetence can under some circumstances form a basis for\ndenying the right to proceed pro se, ante, at 1. We will\npresumably give some meaning to this holding in the\nfuture, but the indeterminacy makes a bad holding worse.\nOnce the right of self-representation for the mentally ill is\na sometime thing, trial judges will have every incentive to\nmake their lives easier\u2014to avoid the painful necessity of\ndeciphering occasional pleadings of the sort contained in\nthe Appendix to today\u2019s opinion\u2014by appointing knowl-\nedgeable and literate counsel.\n   Because I think a defendant who is competent to stand\ntrial, and who is capable of knowing and voluntary waiver\nof assistance of counsel, has a constitutional right to con-\nduct his own defense, I respectfully dissent.\n",

We must decide whether in these circumstances the Constitution forbids a State from insisting that the defendant proceed to trial with counsel, the State thereby denying the defendant the right to represent himself. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 6; <i>Faretta v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109309\"><a href=\"/opinion/109309/faretta-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). We conclude that the Constitution does not forbid a State so to insist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2382</span> I</h2>\n<p>In July 1999 Ahmad Edwards, the respondent, tried to steal a pair of shoes from an Indiana department store. After he was discovered, he drew a gun, fired at a store security officer, and wounded a bystander. He was caught and then charged with attempted murder, battery with a deadly weapon, criminal recklessness, and theft. His mental condition subsequently became the subject of three competency proceedings and two self-representation requests, mostly before the same trial judge:</p>\n<p>1. <i>First Competency Hearing: August 2000.</i> Five months after Edwards' arrest, his court-appointed counsel asked for a psychiatric evaluation. After hearing psychiatrist and neuropsychologist witnesses (in February 2000 and again in August 2000), the court found Edwards incompetent to stand trial, App. 365a, and committed him to Logansport State Hospital for evaluation and treatment, see <i>id.,</i> at 48a-53a.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Second Competency Hearing: March 2002.</i> Seven months after his commitment, doctors found that Edwards' condition had improved to the point where he could stand trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 63a-64a. Several months later, however, but still before trial, Edwards' counsel asked for another psychiatric evaluation. In March 2002, the judge held a competency hearing, considered additional psychiatric evidence, and (in April) found that Edwards, while \"suffer[ing] from mental illness,\" was \"competent to assist his attorneys in his defense and stand trial for the charged crimes.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 114a.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Third Competency Hearing: April 2003.</i> Seven months later but still before trial, Edwards' counsel sought yet another psychiatric evaluation of his client. And, in April 2003, the court held yet another competency hearing. Edwards' counsel presented further psychiatric and neuropsychological evidence showing that Edwards was suffering from serious thinking difficulties and delusions. A testifying psychiatrist reported that Edwards could understand the charges against him, but he was \"unable to cooperate with his attorney in his defense because of his schizophrenic illness\"; \"[h]is delusions and his marked difficulties in thinking make it impossible for him to cooperate with his attorney.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 164a. In November 2003, the court concluded that Edwards was not then competent to stand trial and ordered his recommitment to the state hospital. <i>Id.,</i> at 206a-211a.</p>\n<p>4. <i>First Self-Representation Request and First Trial: June 2005.</i> About eight months after his commitment, the hospital reported that Edwards' condition had again improved to the point that he had again become competent to stand trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 228a-236a. And almost one year after that Edwards' trial began. Just before trial, Edwards asked to represent himself. <i>Id.,</i> at 509a, 520a. He also asked for a continuance, which, he said, he needed in order to proceed <i>pro se. Id.,</i> at 519a-520a. The court refused the continuance. <i>Id.,</i> at 520a. Edwards then proceeded to trial represented by counsel. The jury convicted him of criminal recklessness and theft but failed to reach a verdict on the charges of attempted murder and battery.</p>\n<p>5. <i>Second Self-Representation Request and Second Trial: December 2005.</i> The State decided to retry Edwards on the attempted murder and battery charges. Just before the retrial, Edwards again asked the court to permit him to represent himself. <i>Id.,</i> at 279a-282a. Referring to the lengthy record of psychiatric reports, the trial court noted that Edwards still suffered from schizophrenia and concluded that \"[w]ith these findings, he's competent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2383</span> to stand trial but I'm not going to find he's competent to defend himself.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 527a. The court denied Edwards' self-representation request. Edwards was represented by appointed counsel at his retrial. The jury convicted Edwards on both of the remaining counts.</p>\n<p>Edwards subsequently appealed to Indiana's intermediate appellate court. He argued that the trial court's refusal to permit him to represent himself at his retrial deprived him of his constitutional right of self-representation. U.S. Const., Amdt. 6; <i>Faretta, supra</i><i>.</i> The court agreed and ordered a new trial. The matter then went to the Indiana Supreme Court.

At Indiana's request, we agreed to consider whether the Constitution required the trial court to allow Edwards to represent himself at trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Our examination of this Court's precedents convinces us that those precedents frame the question presented, but they do not answer it. The two cases that set forth the Constitution's \"mental competence\" standard, <i>Dusky v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106037\"><a href=\"/opinion/106037/dusky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> and <i>Drope v. Missouri,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109191\"><a href=\"/opinion/109191/drope-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975), specify that the Constitution does not permit trial of an individual who lacks \"mental competency.\" <i>Dusky</i> defines the competency standard as including both (1) \"whether\" the defendant has \"a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him\" and (2) whether the defendant \"has sufficient present ability <i>to consult with his lawyer</i> with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\" 362 U.S., at 402, 80 S.Ct. 788 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). <i>Drope</i> repeats that standard, stating that it \"has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, <i>to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense</i> may not be subjected to a trial.\" 420 U.S., at 171, 95 S.Ct. 896 (emphasis added). Neither case considered the mental competency issue presented here, namely, the relation of the mental competence standard to the right of self-representation.</p>\n<p>The Court's foundational \"self-representation\" case, <i>Faretta,</i> held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments include a \"constitutional right to proceed <i>without</i> counsel when\" a criminal defendant \"voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.\" 422 U.S., at 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (emphasis in original). The Court implied that right from: (1) a \"nearly universal conviction,\" made manifest in state law, that \"forcing a lawyer upon an unwilling defendant is contrary to his basic right to defend himself if he truly wants to do so,\" <i>id.,</i> at 817-818, 95 S.Ct. 2525; (2) Sixth Amendment language granting rights to the \"accused;\" (3) Sixth Amendment structure indicating that the rights it sets forth, related to the \"fair administration of American justice,\" are \"persona[l]\" to the accused, <i>id.,</i> at 818-821, 95 S.Ct. 2525; (4) the absence of historical examples of <i>forced</i> representation, <i>id.,</i> at 821-832, 95 S.Ct. 2525; and (5) \"`respect for the individual,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (quoting <i>Illinois v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108110\"><a href=\"/opinion/108110/illinois-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span>, 350-351, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2384</span> (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring) (a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel \"must be honored out of `that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law'\")).</p>\n<p><i>Faretta</i> does not answer the question before us both because it did not consider the problem of mental competency (cf. 422 U.S., at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (Faretta was \"literate, competent, and understanding\")), and because <i>Faretta</i> itself and later cases have made clear that the right of self-representation is not absolute. See <i>Martinez v. Court of Appeal of Cal., Fourth Appellate Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118328\"><a href=\"/opinion/118328/martinez-v-court-of-appeal-of-cal-fourth-appellate/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 163, 120 S.Ct. 684, 145 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000) (no right of self-representation on direct appeal in a criminal case); <i>McKaskle v. Wiggins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111095\"><a href=\"/opinion/111095/mckaskle-v-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>, 178-179, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984) (appointment of standby counsel over self-represented defendant's objection is permissible); <i>Faretta,</i> 422 U.S., at 835, n. 46, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (no right \"to abuse the dignity of the courtroom\"); <i>ibid.</i> (no right to avoid compliance with \"relevant rules of procedural and substantive law\"); <i>id.,</i> at 834, n. 46 (no right to \"engag[e] in serious and obstructionist misconduct,\" referring to <i>Illinois v. Allen, supra</i>). The question here concerns a mental-illness-related limitation on the scope of the self-representation right.</p>\n<p>The sole case in which this Court considered mental competence and self-representation together, <i>Godinez, supra,</i> presents a question closer to that at issue here. The case focused upon a borderline-competent criminal defendant who had asked a state trial court to permit him to represent himself and to change his pleas from not guilty to guilty. The state trial court had found that the defendant met <i>Dusky</i>'s mental competence standard, that he \"knowingly and intelligently\" waived his right to assistance of counsel, and that he \"freely and voluntarily\" chose to plead guilty. 509 U.S., at 393, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the state trial court had consequently granted the defendant's self-representation and change-of-plea requests. See <i>id.,</i> at 392-393, 113 S.Ct. 2680. A federal appeals court, however, had vacated the defendant's guilty pleas on the ground that the Constitution required the trial court to ask a further question, namely, whether the defendant was competent to waive his constitutional right to counsel. See <i>id.,</i> at 393-394, 113 S.Ct. 2680. Competence to make that latter decision, the appeals court said, required the defendant to satisfy a higher mental competency standard than the standard set forth in <i>Dusky.</i> See 509 U.S., at 393-394, 113 S.Ct. 2680. <i>Dusky</i>'s more general standard sought only to determine whether a defendant represented by counsel was competent to stand trial, not whether he was competent to waive his right to counsel. 509 U.S., at 394-395, 113 S.Ct. 2680.</p>\n<p>This Court, reversing the Court of Appeals, \"reject[ed] the notion that competence to plead guilty or to waive the right to counsel must be measured by a standard that is higher than (or even different from) the <i>Dusky</i> standard.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 398, 113 S.Ct. 2680. The decision to plead guilty, we said, \"is no more complicated than the sum total of decisions that a [represented] defendant may be called upon to make during the course of a trial.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Hence \"there is no reason to believe that the decision to waive counsel requires an appreciably higher level of mental functioning than the decision to waive other constitutional rights.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 399, 113 S.Ct. 2680. And even assuming that self-representation might pose special trial-related difficulties, \"the competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the competence to <i>waive the right,</i> not the competence to represent himself.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2385</span> original). For this reason, we concluded, \"the defendant's `technical legal knowledge' is `not relevant' to the determination.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 400, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (quoting <i>Faretta, supra,</i> at 836, 95 S.Ct. 2525).</p>\n<p>We concede that <i>Godinez</i> bears certain similarities with the present case. Both involve mental competence and self-representation. Both involve a defendant who wants to represent himself. Both involve a mental condition that falls in a gray area between <i>Dusky</i>'s minimal constitutional requirement that measures a defendant's ability to stand trial and a somewhat higher standard that measures mental fitness for another legal purpose.</p>\n<p>We nonetheless conclude that <i>Godinez</i> does not answer the question before us now. In part that is because the Court of Appeals higher standard at issue in <i>Godinez</i> differs in a critical way from the higher standard at issue here. In <i>Godinez,</i> the higher standard sought to measure the defendant's ability to proceed on his own to enter a guilty plea; here the higher standard seeks to measure the defendant's ability to conduct trial proceedings. To put the matter more specifically, the <i>Godinez</i> defendant sought only to change his pleas to guilty, he did not seek to conduct trial proceedings, and his ability to conduct a defense at trial was expressly not at issue. Thus we emphasized in <i>Godinez</i> that we needed to consider only the defendant's \"competence to <i>waive the right.</i>\" 509 U.S., at 399, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (emphasis in original). And we further emphasized that we need <i>not</i> consider the defendant's \"technical legal knowledge\" about how to proceed at trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 400, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (internal quotation marks omitted). We found our holding consistent with this Court's earlier statement in <i>Massey v. Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105251\"><a href=\"/opinion/105251/massey-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 108, 75 S.Ct. 145, 99 L.Ed. 135 (1954), that \"[o]ne might not be insane in the sense of being incapable of standing trial and yet lack the capacity to stand trial without benefit of counsel.\" See <i>Godinez, supra,</i> at 399-400, n. 10, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (quoting <i>Massey</i> and noting that it dealt with \"a question that is quite different from the question presented\" in <i>Godinez</i>). In this case, the very matters that we did not consider in <i>Godinez</i> are directly before us.</p>\n<p>For another thing, <i>Godinez</i> involved a State that sought to <i>permit</i> a gray-area defendant to represent himself. <i>Godinez</i>'s constitutional holding is that a State may do so. But that holding simply does not tell a State whether it may <i>deny</i> a gray-area defendant the right to represent himself\u0097the matter at issue here. One might argue that <i>Godinez</i>'s grant (to a State) of permission to allow a gray-area defendant self-representation must implicitly include permission to deny self-representation. Cf. 509 U.S., at 402, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (\"States are free to adopt competency standards that are more elaborate than the <i>Dusky</i> formulation\"). Yet one could more forcefully argue that <i>Godinez</i> simply did not consider whether the Constitution <i>requires</i> self-representation by gray-area defendants even in circumstances where the State seeks to disallow it (the question here). The upshot is that, in our view, the question before us is an open one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We now turn to the question presented. We assume that a criminal defendant has sufficient mental competence to stand trial (<i>i.e.,</i> the defendant meets <i>Dusky</i>'s standard) and that the defendant insists on representing himself during that trial. We ask whether the Constitution permits a State to limit that defendant's self-representation right by insisting upon representation by counsel at trial\u0097on the ground that the defendant lacks the mental capacity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2386</span> to conduct his trial defense unless represented.</p>\n<p>Several considerations taken together lead us to conclude that the answer to this question is yes. First, the Court's precedent, while not answering the question, points slightly in the direction of our affirmative answer. <i>Godinez,</i> as we have just said, simply leaves the question open. But the Court's \"mental competency\" cases set forth a standard that focuses directly upon a defendant's \"present ability to consult with his lawyer,\" <i>Dusky,</i> 362 U.S., at 402, 80 S.Ct. 788 (internal quotation marks omitted); a \"capacity . . . to consult with counsel,\" and an ability \"to assist [counsel] in preparing his defense,\" <i>Drope,</i> 420 U.S., at 171, 95 S.Ct. 896. See <i>ibid.</i> (\"It has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, <i>to consult with counsel,</i> and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial\" (emphasis added)). These standards assume representation by counsel and emphasize the importance of counsel. They thus suggest (though do not hold) that an instance in which a defendant who would choose to forgo counsel at trial presents a very different set of circumstances, which in our view, calls for a different standard.</p>\n<p>At the same time <i>Faretta,</i> the foundational self-representation case, rested its conclusion in part upon pre-existing state law set forth in cases all of which are consistent with, and at least two of which expressly adopt, a competency limitation on the self-representation right. See 422 U.S., at 813, and n. 9, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (citing 16 state-court decisions and two secondary sources). See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Cappetta v. State,</i> 204 So.2d 913, 917-918 (Fla.App.1967), rev'd on other grounds, 216 So.2d 749 (Fla.1968), cited in <i>Faretta, supra,</i> at 813, n. 9, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (assuring a \"mentally competent\" defendant the right \"to conduct his own defense\" <i>provided that</i> \"no unusual circumstances exist\" such as, <i>e.g.,</i> \"mental derangement\" that \"would . . . depriv[e]\" the defendant \"of a fair trial if allowed to conduct his own defense,\" 204 So.2d, at 917-918); <i>id.,</i> at 918 (noting that \"whether unusual circumstances are evident is a matter resting in the sound discretion granted to the trial judge\"); <i>Allen v. Commonwealth,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></span>, 562-563, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></span>, 195 (1949) (noting \"the assignment of counsel\" was \"necessary\" where there was some \"special circumstance\" such as when the criminal defendant was \"mentally defective\").</p>\n<p>Second, the nature of the problem before us cautions against the use of a single mental competency standard for deciding both (1) whether a defendant who is represented by counsel can proceed to trial and (2) whether a defendant who goes to trial must be permitted to represent himself. Mental illness itself is not a unitary concept. It varies in degree. It can vary over time. It interferes with an individual's functioning at different times in different ways. The history of this case (set forth in Part I, <i>supra)</i> illustrates the complexity of the problem. In certain instances an individual may well be able to satisfy <i>Dusky</i>'s mental competence standard, for he will be able to work with counsel at trial, yet at the same time he may be unable to carry out the basic tasks needed to present his own defense without the help of counsel. See, <i>e.g.,</i> N. Poythress, R. Bonnie, J. Monahan, R. Otto, &amp; S. Hoge, Adjudicative Competence: The MacArthur Studies 103 (2002) (\"Within each domain of adjudicative competence (competence to assist counsel; decisional competence) the data indicate that understanding, reasoning, and appreciation [of the charges against a defendant] are separable and somewhat independent aspects of functional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2387</span> legal ability\"). See also <i>McKaskle,</i> 465 U.S., at 174, 104 S.Ct. 944 (describing trial tasks as including organization of defense, making motions, arguing points of law, participating in <i>voir dire,</i> questioning witnesses, and addressing the court and jury).</p>\n<p>The American Psychiatric Association (APA) tells us (without dispute) in its <i>amicus</i> brief filed in support of neither party that \"[d]isorganized thinking, deficits in sustaining attention and concentration, impaired expressive abilities, anxiety, and other common symptoms of severe mental illnesses can impair the defendant's ability to play the significantly expanded role required for self-representation even if he can play the lesser role of represented defendant.\" Brief for APA et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 26. Motions and other documents that the defendant prepared in this case (one of which we include in the Appendix, <i>infra</i>) suggest to a layperson the common sense of this general conclusion.</p>\n<p>Third, in our view, a right of self-representation at trial will not \"affirm the dignity\" of a defendant who lacks the mental capacity to conduct his defense without the assistance of counsel. <i>McKaskle, supra,</i> at 176-177, 104 S.Ct. 944 (\"Dignity\" and \"autonomy\" of individual underlie self-representation right). To the contrary, given that defendant's uncertain mental state, the spectacle that could well result from his self-representation at trial is at least as likely to prove humiliating as ennobling. Moreover, insofar as a defendant's lack of capacity threatens an improper conviction or sentence, self-representation in that exceptional context undercuts the most basic of the Constitution's criminal law objectives, providing a fair trial. As Justice Brennan put it, \"[t]he Constitution would protect none of us if it prevented the courts from acting to preserve the very processes that the Constitution itself prescribes.\" <i>Allen,</i> 397 U.S., at 350, 90 S.Ct. 1057 (concurring opinion). See <i>Martinez,</i> 528 U.S., at 162, 120 S.Ct. 684 (\"Even at the trial level . . . the government's interest in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the trial at times outweighs the defendant's interest in acting as his own lawyer\"). See also <i>Sell v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130152\"><a href=\"/opinion/130152/sell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span>, 180, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197 (2003) (\"[T]he Government has a concomitant, constitutionally essential interest in assuring that the defendant's trial is a fair one\").</p>\n<p>Further, proceedings must not only be fair, they must \"appear fair to all who observe them.\" <i>Wheat v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112074\"><a href=\"/opinion/112074/wheat-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 160, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988). An <i>amicus</i> brief reports one psychiatrist's reaction to having observed a patient (a patient who had satisfied <i>Dusky</i>) try to conduct his own defense: \"[H]ow in the world can our legal system allow an insane man to defend himself?\" Brief for Ohio et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 24 (internal quotation marks omitted). See <i>Massey,</i> 348 U.S., at 108, 75 S.Ct. 145 (\"No trial can be fair that leaves the defense to a man who is insane, unaided by counsel, and who by reason of his mental condition stands helpless and alone before the court\"). The application of <i>Dusky</i>'s basic mental competence standard can help in part to avoid this result. But given the different capacities needed to proceed to trial without counsel, there is little reason to believe that <i>Dusky</i> alone is sufficient. At the same time, the trial judge, particularly one such as the trial judge in this case, who presided over one of Edwards' competency hearings and his two trials, will often prove best able to make more fine-tuned mental capacity decisions, tailored to the individualized circumstances of a particular defendant.</p>\n<p>We consequently conclude that the Constitution permits judges to take realistic account of the particular defendant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2388</span> mental capacities by asking whether a defendant who seeks to conduct his own defense at trial is mentally competent to do so. That is to say, the Constitution permits States to insist upon representation by counsel for those competent enough to stand trial under <i>Dusky</i> but who still suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Indiana has also asked us to adopt, as a measure of a defendant's ability to conduct a trial, a more specific standard that would \"deny a criminal defendant the right to represent himself at trial where the defendant cannot communicate coherently with the court or a jury.\" Brief for Petitioner 20 (emphasis deleted). We are sufficiently uncertain, however, as to how that particular standard would work in practice to refrain from endorsing it as a federal constitutional standard here. We need not now, and we do not, adopt it.</p>\n<p>Indiana has also asked us to overrule <i>Faretta.</i> We decline to do so. We recognize that judges have sometimes expressed concern that <i>Faretta,</i> contrary to its intent, has led to trials that are unfair. See <i>Martinez, supra,</i> at 164, 120 S.Ct. 684 (BREYER, J., concurring) (noting practical concerns of trial judges). But recent empirical research suggests that such instances are not common. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Hashimoto, Defending the Right of Self-Representation: An Empirical Look at the Pro Se Felony Defendant, 85 N.C.L.Rev. 423, 427, 447, 428 (2007) (noting that of the small number of defendants who chose to proceed <i>pro se</i>\u0097\"roughly 0.3% to 0.5%\" of the total, state felony defendants in particular \"appear to have achieved higher felony acquittal rates than their represented counterparts in that they were less likely to have been convicted of felonies\"). At the same time, instances in which the trial's fairness is in doubt may well be concentrated in the 20 percent or so of self-representation cases where the mental competence of the defendant is also at issue. See <i>id.,</i> at 428 (about 20 percent of federal <i>pro se</i> felony defendants ordered to undergo competency evaluations). If so, today's opinion, assuring trial judges the authority to deal appropriately with cases in the latter category, may well alleviate those fair trial concerns.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX</h2>\n<p>Excerpt from respondent's filing entitled \"`Defendant's Version of the Instant Offense,'\" which he had attached to his presentence investigation report:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`The appointed motion of permissive intervention filed therein the court superior on, 6-26-01 caused a stay of action and apon it's expiration or thereafter three years the plan to establish a youth program to and for the coordination of aspects of law enforcement to prevent and reduce crime amoung young people in Indiana became a diplomatic act as under the Safe Streets Act of 1967, \"A omnibuc considerate agent: I membered clients within the public and others that at/production of the courts actions showcased causes.

California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109309\"><a href=\"/opinion/109309/faretta-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). A mentally ill defendant who knowingly and voluntarily elects to proceed <i>pro se</i> instead of through counsel receives a fair trial that comports with the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Godinez v. Moran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112898\"><a href=\"/opinion/112898/godinez-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993). The Court today concludes that a State may nonetheless strip a mentally ill defendant of the right to represent himself when that would be fairer. In my view the Constitution does not permit a State to substitute its own perception of fairness for the defendant's right to make his own case before the jury\u0097a specific right long understood as essential to a fair trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Ahmad Edwards suffers from schizophrenia, an illness that has manifested itself in different ways over time, depending on how and whether Edwards was treated as well as on other factors that appear harder to identify. In the years between 2000 and 2003\u0097years in which Edwards was apparently not treated with the antipsychotic medications and other drugs that are commonly prescribed for his illness\u0097 Edwards was repeatedly declared incompetent to stand trial. Even during this period, however, his mental state seems to have fluctuated. For instance, one psychiatrist in March 2001 described Edwards in a competency report as \"free of psychosis, depression, mania, and confusion,\" \"alert, oriented, [and] appropriate,\" apparently \"able to think clearly\" and apparently \"psychiatrically normal.\" App. 61a.</p>\n<p>Edwards seems to have been treated with antipsychotic medication for the first time in 2004. He was found competent to stand trial the same year. The psychiatrist making the recommendation described Edwards' thought processes as \"coherent\" and wrote that he \"communicate[d] very well,\" that his speech was \"easy to understand,\" that he displayed \"good communications skills, cooperative attitude, average intelligence, and good cognitive functioning,\" that he could \"appraise the roles of the participants in the courtroom proceedings,\" and that he had the capacity to challenge prosecution witnesses realistically and to testify relevantly. <i>Id.,</i> at 232a-235a (report of Dr. Robert Sena).</p>\n<p>Over the course of what became two separate criminal trials, Edwards sought to act as his own lawyer. He filed a number of incoherent written pleadings with the judge on which the Court places emphasis, but he also filed several intelligible pleadings, such as a motion to dismiss counsel, a motion to dismiss charges under the Indiana speedy trial provision, and a motion seeking a trial transcript.</p>\n<p>Edwards made arguments in the courtroom that were more coherent than his written pleadings. In seeking to represent himself at his first trial, Edwards complained in detail that the attorney representing him had not spent adequate time preparing and was not sharing legal materials for use in his defense. The trial judge concluded that Edwards had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel and proceeded to quiz Edwards about matters of state law. Edwards correctly answered questions about the meaning of <i>voir dire</i> and how it operated, and described the basic framework for admitting videotape evidence to trial, though he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2390</span> was unable to answer other questions, including questions about the topics covered by state evidentiary rules that the judge identified only by number. He persisted in his request to represent himself, but the judge denied the request because Edwards acknowledged he would need a continuance. Represented by counsel, he was convicted of criminal recklessness and theft, but the jury deadlocked on charges of attempted murder and battery.</p>\n<p>At his second trial, Edwards again asked the judge to be allowed to proceed <i>pro se.</i> He explained that he and his attorney disagreed about which defense to present to the attempted murder charge. Edwards' counsel favored lack of intent to kill; Edwards, self-defense. As the defendant put it: \"My objection is me and my attorney actually had discussed a defense, I think prosecution had mentioned that, and we are in disagreement with it. He has a defense and I have a defense that I would like to represent or present to the Judge.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 523a.</p>\n<p>The court again rejected Edwards' request to proceed <i>pro se,</i> and this time it did not have the justification that Edwards had sought a continuance. The court did not dispute that Edwards knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel, but stated it was \"going to carve out a third exception\" to the right of self-representation, and\u0097without explaining precisely what abilities Edwards lacked\u0097stated Edwards was \"competent to stand trial but I'm not going to find he's competent to defend himself.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 527a. Edwards sought\u0097by a request through counsel and by raising an objection in open court\u0097to address the judge on the matter, but the judge refused, stating that the issue had already been decided. Edwards' court-appointed attorney pursued the defense the attorney judged best\u0097lack of intent, not self-defense\u0097and Edwards was convicted of both attempted murder and battery. The Supreme Court of Indiana held that he was entitled to a new trial because he had been denied the right to represent himself. The State of Indiana sought certiorari, which we granted. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 741, 169 L.Ed.2d 579 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Constitution guarantees to every criminal defendant the \"right to proceed <i>without</i> counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.\" <i>Faretta,</i> 422 U.S., at 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525. The right reflects \"a nearly universal conviction, on the part of our people as well as our courts, that forcing a lawyer upon an unwilling defendant is contrary to his basic right to defend himself if he truly wants to do so.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 817, 95 S.Ct. 2525. <i>Faretta</i>'s discussion of the history of the right, <i>id.,</i> at 821-833, 95 S.Ct. 2525, includes the observation that \"[i]n the long history of British criminal jurisprudence, there was only one tribunal that ever adopted a practice of forcing counsel upon an unwilling defendant in a criminal proceeding. The tribunal was the Star Chamber,\" <i>id.,</i> at 821, 95 S.Ct. 2525. <i>Faretta</i> described the right to proceed <i>pro se</i> as a premise of the Sixth Amendment, which confers the tools for a defense on the \"accused,\" and describes the role of the attorney as one of \"assistance.\" The right of self-representation could also be seen as a part of the traditional meaning of the Due Process Clause. See <i>Martinez v. Court of Appeal of Cal., Fourth Appellate Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118328\"><a href=\"/opinion/118328/martinez-v-court-of-appeal-of-cal-fourth-appellate/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 165, 120 S.Ct. 684, 145 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Whichever provision provides its source, it means that a State simply may not force a lawyer upon a criminal defendant who wishes to conduct his own defense. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2391</span> <i>Faretta,</i> 422 U.S., at 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525.</p>\n<p>Exercising the right of self-representation requires waiving the right to counsel. A defendant may represent himself only when he \"`knowingly and intelligently'\" waives the lawyer's assistance that is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <i>Id.,</i> at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525. He must \"be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation,\" and the record must \"establish that `he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></span>, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942)). This limitation may be relevant to many mentally ill defendants, but there is no dispute that Edwards was not one of them. Edwards was warned extensively of the risks of proceeding <i>pro se.</i> The trial judge found that Edwards had \"knowingly and voluntarily\" waived his right to counsel at his first trial, App. 512a, and at his second trial the judge denied him the right to represent himself only by \"carv[ing] out\" a new \"exception\" to the right beyond the standard of knowing and voluntary waiver, <i>id.,</i> at 527a.</p>\n<p>When a defendant appreciates the risks of forgoing counsel and chooses to do so voluntarily, the Constitution protects his ability to present his own defense even when that harms his case. In fact waiving counsel \"usually\" does so. <i>McKaskle v. Wiggins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111095\"><a href=\"/opinion/111095/mckaskle-v-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>, 177, n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984); see also <i>Faretta,</i> 422 U.S., at 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525. We have nonetheless said that the defendant's \"choice must be honored out of `that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> What the Constitution requires is not that a State's case be subject to the most rigorous adversarial testing possible\u0097after all, it permits a defendant to eliminate <i>all</i> adversarial testing by pleading guilty. What the Constitution requires is that a defendant be given the right to challenge the State's case against him using the arguments <i>he</i> sees fit.</p>\n<p>In <i>Godinez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112898\"><a href=\"/opinion/112898/godinez-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321, we held that the Due Process Clause posed no barrier to permitting a defendant who suffered from mental illness both to waive his right to counsel and to plead guilty, so long as he was competent to stand trial and knowingly and voluntarily waived trial and the counsel right. <i>Id.,</i> at 391, 400, 113 S.Ct. 2680. It was \"never the rule at common law\" that a defendant could be competent to stand trial and yet incompetent to either exercise or give up some of the rights provided for his defense. <i>Id.,</i> at 404, 113 S.Ct. 2680 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). We rejected the invitation to craft a higher competency standard for waiving counsel than for standing trial. That proposal, we said, was built on the \"flawed premise\" that a defendant's \"competence to represent himself\" was the relevant measure: \"[T]he competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the competence to <i>waive the right,</i> not the competence to represent himself.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 399, 113 S.Ct. 2680. We grounded this on <i>Faretta</i>'s candid acknowledgment that the Sixth Amendment protected the defendant's right to conduct a defense to his disadvantage. 509 U.S. at 399-400, 113 S.Ct. 2680.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court is correct that this case presents a variation on <i>Godinez:</i> It presents the question not whether another constitutional requirement (in <i>Godinez,</i> the proposed higher degree of competence required for a waiver) limits a defendant's constitutional right to elect self-representation, but whether a State's view of fairness <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2392</span> (or of other values) permits it to strip the defendant of this right. But that makes the question before us an easier one. While one constitutional requirement must yield to another in case of conflict, nothing permits a State, because of <i>its</i> view of what is fair, to deny a constitutional protection. Although \"the purpose of the rights set forth in [the Sixth] Amendment is to ensure a fair trial,\" it \"does not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145633\"><a href=\"/opinion/145633/united-states-v-gonzalez-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>, 145, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006). Thus, although the Confrontation Clause aims to produce fairness by ensuring the reliability of testimony, States may not provide for unconfronted testimony to be used at trial so long as it is reliable. <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 61, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). We have rejected an approach to individual liberties that \"`abstracts from the right to its purposes, and then eliminates the right.'\" <i>Gonzalez-Lopez, supra,</i> at 145, 126 S.Ct. 2557 (quoting <i>Maryland v. Craig,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112489\"><a href=\"/opinion/112489/maryland-v-craig/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 862, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p>Until today, the right of self-representation has been accorded the same respect as other constitutional guarantees. The only circumstance in which we have permitted the State to deprive a defendant of this trial right is the one under which we have allowed the State to deny <i>other</i> such rights: when it is necessary to enable the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion. That overriding necessity, we have said, justifies forfeiture of even the Sixth Amendment right to be present at trial\u0097 if, after being threatened with removal, a defendant \"insists on conducting himself in a manner so disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that his trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom.\" <i>Illinois v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108110\"><a href=\"/opinion/108110/illinois-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span>, 343, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970). A <i>pro se</i> defendant may not \"abuse the dignity of the courtroom,\" nor may he fail to \"comply with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law,\" and a court may \"terminate\" the self-representation of a defendant who \"deliberately engages in serious and obstructionist misconduct.\" <i>Faretta, supra,</i> at 834-835, n. 46, 95 S.Ct. 2525. This ground for terminating self-representation is unavailable here, however, because Edwards was not even allowed to begin to represent himself, and because he was respectful and compliant and did not provide a basis to conclude a trial could not have gone forward had he been allowed to press his own claims.</p>\n<p>Beyond this circumstance, we have never constrained the ability of a defendant to retain \"actual control over the case he chooses to present to the jury\"\u0097what we have termed \"the core of the <i>Faretta</i> right.\" <i>Wiggins, supra,</i> at 178, 104 S.Ct. 944. Thus, while <i>Faretta</i> recognized that the right of self-representation does not bar the court from appointing standby counsel, we explained in <i>Wiggins</i> that \"[t]he <i>pro se</i> defendant must be allowed to control the organization and content of his own defense, to make motions, to argue points of law, to participate in <i>voir dire,</i> to question witnesses, and to address the court and the jury at appropriate points in the trial.\" 465 U.S., at 174, 104 S.Ct. 944. Furthermore, because \"multiple voices `for the defense'\" could \"confuse the message the defendant wishes to convey,\" <i>id.,</i> at 177, 104 S.Ct. 944, a standby attorney's participation would be barred when it would \"destroy the jury's perception that the defendant is representing himself,\" <i>id.,</i> at 178, 104 S.Ct. 944.</p>\n<p>As I have explained, I would not adopt an approach to the right of self-representation that we have squarely rejected for other rights\u0097allowing courts to disregard <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2393</span> the right when doing so serves the purposes for which the right was intended. But if I were to adopt such an approach, I would remain in dissent, because I believe the Court's assessment of the purposes of the right of self-representation is inaccurate to boot. While there is little doubt that preserving individual \"`dignity'\" (to which the Court refers), <i>ante,</i> at 2387, is paramount among those purposes, there is equally little doubt that the loss of \"dignity\" the right is designed to prevent is <i>not</i> the defendant's making a fool of himself by presenting an amateurish or even incoherent defense. Rather, the dignity at issue is the supreme human dignity of being master of one's fate rather than a ward of the State\u0097the dignity of individual choice. <i>Faretta</i> explained that the Sixth Amendment's counsel clause should not be invoked to impair \"`the exercise of [the defendant's] free choice'\" to dispense with the right, 422 U.S., at 815, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (quoting <i>Adams,</i> 317 U.S., at 280, 63 S.Ct. 236); for \"whatever else may be said of those who wrote the Bill of Rights, surely there can be no doubt that they understood the inestimable worth of free choice,\" 422 U.S., at 833-834, 95 S.Ct. 2525. Nine years later, when we wrote in <i>Wiggins</i> that the self-representation right served the \"dignity and autonomy of the accused,\" 465 U.S., at 177, 104 S.Ct. 944, we explained in no uncertain terms that this meant according every defendant the right to his say in court. In particular, we said that individual dignity and autonomy barred standby counsel from participating in a manner that would to \"destroy the jury's perception that the defendant is representing himself,\" and meant that \"the <i>pro se</i> defendant is entitled to preserve actual control over the case he chooses to present to the jury.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 178, 104 S.Ct. 944. In sum, if the Court is to honor the particular conception of \"dignity\" that underlies the self-representation right, it should respect the autonomy of the individual by honoring his choices knowingly and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p>A further purpose that the Court finds is advanced by denial of the right of self-representation is the purpose of assuring that trials \"appear fair to all who observe them.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2387. To my knowledge we have never denied a defendant a right simply on the ground that it would make his trial appear less \"fair\" to outside observers, and I would not inaugurate that principle here. But were I to do so, I would not apply it to deny a defendant the right to represent himself when he knowingly and voluntarily waives counsel. When Edwards stood to say that \"I have a defense that I would like to represent or present to the Judge,\" App. 523a, it seems to me the epitome of both actual and apparent unfairness for the judge to say, I have heard \"your desire to proceed by yourself and I've denied your request, so your attorney will speak for you from now on,\" <i>id.,</i> at 530a.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>It may be that the Court permits a State to deprive mentally ill defendants of a historic component of a fair trial because it is suspicious of the constitutional footing of the right of self-representation itself. The right is not explicitly set forth in the text of the Sixth Amendment, and some Members of this Court have expressed skepticism about <i>Faretta</i>'s holding. See <i>Martinez, supra,</i> at 156-158, 120 S.Ct. 684 (questioning relevance of historical evidence underlying <i>Faretta</i>'s holding); 528 U.S., at 164, 120 S.Ct. 684 (BREYER, J., concurring) (noting \"judges closer to the firing line have sometimes expressed dismay about the practical consequences\" of the right of self-representation).</p>\n<p>While the Sixth Amendment makes no mention of the right to forgo counsel, it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2394</span> provides the defendant, and not his lawyer, the right to call witnesses in his defense and to confront witnesses against him, and counsel is permitted to assist in \"<i>his</i> defence\" (emphasis added). Our trial system, however, allows the attorney representing a defendant \"full authority to manage the conduct of the trial\"\u0097an authority without which \"[t]he adversary process could not function effectively.\" <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111986\"><a href=\"/opinion/111986/taylor-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988); see also <i>Florida v. Nixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137735\"><a href=\"/opinion/137735/florida-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span>, 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004). We have held that \"the client must accept the consequences of the lawyer's decision to forgo cross-examination, to decide not to put certain witnesses on the stand, or to decide not to disclose the identity of certain witnesses in advance of trial.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 418, 108 S.Ct. 646. Thus, in order for the defendant's right to call his own witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses, and to put on a defense to be anything more than \"a tenuous and unacceptable legal fiction,\" a defendant must have consented to the representation of counsel. <i>Faretta, supra,</i> at 821, 95 S.Ct. 2525. Otherwise, \"the defense presented is not the defense guaranteed him by the Constitution, for in a very real sense, it is not <i>his</i> defense.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The facts of this case illustrate this point with the utmost clarity. Edwards wished to take a self-defense case to the jury. His counsel preferred a defense that focused on lack of intent. Having been denied the right to conduct his own defense, Edwards was convicted without having had the opportunity to present to the jury the grounds he believed supported his innocence. I do not doubt that he likely would have been convicted anyway. But to hold that a defendant may be deprived of the right to make legal arguments for acquittal simply because a state-selected agent has made different arguments on his behalf is, as Justice Frankfurter wrote in <i>Adams, supra,</i> at 280, 63 S.Ct. 236, to \"imprison a man in his privileges and call it the Constitution.\" In singling out mentally ill defendants for this treatment, the Court's opinion does not even have the questionable virtue of being politically correct. At a time when all society is trying to mainstream the mentally impaired, the Court permits them to be deprived of a basic constitutional right\u0097for their own good.</p>\n<p>Today's holding is extraordinarily vague. The Court does not accept Indiana's position that self-representation can be denied \"`where the defendant cannot communicate coherently with the court or a jury,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 2388. It does not even hold that Edwards was properly denied his right to represent himself. It holds only that lack of mental competence can under some circumstances form a basis for denying the right to proceed <i>pro se, ante,</i> at 2381-2382. We will presumably give some meaning to this holding in the future, but the indeterminacy makes a bad holding worse. Once the right of self-representation for the mentally ill is a sometime thing, trial judges will have every incentive to make their lives easier\u0097to avoid the painful necessity of deciphering occasional pleadings of the sort contained in the Appendix to today's opinion\u0097by appointing knowledgeable and literate counsel.</p>\n<p>Because I think a defendant who is competent to stand trial, and who is capable of knowing and voluntary waiver of assistance of counsel, has a constitutional right to conduct his own defense, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>",
