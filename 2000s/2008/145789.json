The question is whether an employer facing a disparate-impact claim and planning to defend on the basis of RFOA must not only produce evidence raising the defense, but also persuade the factfinder of its merit. We hold that the employer must do both.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The National Government pays private companies to do some of the work maintaining the Nation's fleet of nuclear-powered warships. One such contractor is respondent KAPL, Inc. (Knolls), the operator of the Government's Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, which has a history dating back to the first nuclear-powered submarines in the 1940s and 1950s. The United States Navy and the Department of Energy jointly fund Knolls's operations, decide what projects it should pursue, and set its annual staffing limits. In recent years, Knolls has been charged with designing prototype naval nuclear reactors and with training Navy personnel to run them.</p>\n<p>The demands for naval nuclear reactors changed with the end of the Cold War, and for fiscal year 1996 Knolls was ordered to reduce its work force. Even after a hundred or so employees chose to take the company's ensuing buyout offer, Knolls was left with thirty-some jobs to cut.<sup>[1]</sup> Petitioners (Meacham, for short) are among those laid off in the resulting \"involuntary reduction in force.\" In order to select those for layoff, Knolls told its managers to score their subordinates on three scales, \"performance,\" \"flexibility,\" and \"critical skills.\"<sup>[2]</sup> The scores were summed, along with points for years of service, and the totals determined who should be let go.</p>\n<p>Of the 31 salaried employees laid off, 30 were at least 40 years old.<sup>[3]</sup> Twenty-eight of them sued, raising both disparate-treatment (discriminatory intent) and disparate-impact (discriminatory result) claims under the ADEA and state law, alleging that Knolls \"designed and implemented its workforce reduction process to eliminate older employees and that, regardless of intent, the process had a discriminatory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2399</span> impact on ADEA-protected employees.\" <i>Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory,</i> 381 F.3d 56, 61 (C.A.2 2004) <i>(Meacham I)</i><i>.</i> To show a disparate impact, the workers relied on a statistical expert's testimony to the effect that results so skewed according to age could rarely occur by chance;<sup>[4]</sup> and that the scores for \"flexibility\" and \"criticality,\" over which managers had the most discretionary judgment, had the firmest statistical ties to the outcomes. <i>Id.,</i> at 65.</p>\n<p>The jury found for Meacham on the disparate-impact claim (but not on the disparate-treatment claim). The Court of Appeals affirmed, after examining the verdict through the lens of the so-called \"burden shifting\" scheme of inference spelled out in <i>Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,</i> 490 U.S. 642, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989). See <i>Meacham I, supra,</i> at 74-76.<sup>[5]</sup> After Knolls sought certiorari, we vacated the judgment and remanded for further proceedings in light of <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S. 228, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005), decided while Knolls's petition was pending. See 544 U.S. 957, 125 S.Ct. 1731, 161 L.Ed.2d 596 (2005).</p>\n<p>On remand, the same Court of Appeals panel ruled in favor of Knolls, over a dissent. 461 F.3d 134 (C.A.2 2006) (case below) <i>(Meacham II).</i> The majority found its prior ruling \"untenable\" because it had applied the <i>Wards Cove</i> \"business necessity\" standard rather than a \"reasonableness\" test, contrary to <i>City of Jackson</i>; and on the latter standard, Meacham, the employee, had not carried the burden of persuasion. 461 F.3d, at 140-141, 144.<sup>[6]</sup> In dissent, Judge Pooler took issue with the majority for confusing business justifications under <i>Wards Cove</i> with the statutory RFOA exemption, which she read to be an affirmative defense with the burden of persuasion falling on defendants. 461 F.3d, at 147, 149-152.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2400</span> Meacham sought certiorari, noting conflicting decisions assigning the burden of persuasion on the reasonableness of the factor other than age; the Court of Appeals in this case placed it on the employee (to show the non-age factor unreasonable), but the Ninth Circuit in <i>Criswell v. Western Airlines, Inc.,</i> 709 F.2d 544, 552 (1983), had assigned it to the employer (to show the factor was a reasonable one). In fact it was in <i>Criswell</i> that we first took up this question, only to find it not well posed in that case. <i>Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell,</i> 472 U.S. 400, 408, n. 10, 105 S.Ct. 2743, 86 L.Ed.2d 321 (1985). We granted certiorari, 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1118, 169 L.Ed.2d 846 (2007), and now vacate the judgment of the Second Circuit and remand.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The ADEA's general prohibitions against age discrimination, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 623(a)-(c), (e), are subject to a separate provision, \u00a7 623(f), creating exemptions for employer practices \"otherwise prohibited under subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e).\" The RFOA exemption is listed in \u00a7 623(f) alongside one for bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQ): \"It shall not be unlawful for an employer . . . to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e) . . . where age is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business, or where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age . . . .\" \u00a7 623(f)(1).</p>\n<p>Given how the statute reads, with exemptions laid out apart from the prohibitions (and expressly referring to the prohibited conduct as such), it is no surprise that we have already spoken of the BFOQ and RFOA provisions as being among the ADEA's \"five affirmative defenses,\" <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston,</i> 469 U.S. 111, 122, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985). After looking at the statutory text, most lawyers would accept that characterization as a matter of course, thanks to the familiar principle that \"[w]hen a proviso. . . carves an exception out of the body of a statute or contract those who set up such exception must prove it.\" <i>Javierre v. Central Altagracia,</i> 217 U.S. 502, 508, 30 S.Ct. 598, 54 L.Ed. 859 (1910) (opinion for the Court by Holmes, J.); see also <i>FTC v. Morton Salt Co.,</i> 334 U.S. 37, 44-45, 68 S.Ct. 822, 92 L.Ed. 1196 (1948) (\"[T]he burden of proving justification or exemption under a special exception to the prohibitions of a statute generally rests on one who claims its benefits . . .\"); <i>United States v. First City Nat. Bank of Houston,</i> 386 U.S. 361, 366, 87 S.Ct. 1088, 18 L.Ed.2d 151 (1967) (citing <i>Morton Salt, supra,</i> at 44-45, 68 S.Ct. 822). That longstanding convention is part of the backdrop against which the Congress writes laws, and we respect it unless we have compelling reasons to think that Congress meant to put the burden of persuasion on the other side. See <i>Schaffer v. Weast,</i> 546 U.S. 49, 57-58, 126 S.Ct. 528, 163 L.Ed.2d 387 (2005) (\"Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief\").</p>\n<p>We have never been given any reason for a heterodox take on the RFOA clause's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2401</span> nearest neighbor, and our prior cases recognize that the BFOQ clause establishes an affirmative defense against claims of disparate treatment. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>City of Jackson, supra,</i> at 233, n. 3, 125 S.Ct. 1536; <i>Western Air Lines, Inc., supra,</i> at 414-419, and nn. 24, 29, 105 S.Ct. 2743. We have likewise given the affirmative defense construction to the exemption in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 for pay differentials based on \"any other factor other than sex,\" <i>Corning Glass Works v. Brennan,</i> 417 U.S. 188, 196, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted); and there, we took account of the particular weight given to the interpretive convention already noted, when enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), <i>id.,</i> at 196-197, 94 S.Ct. 2223 (\"[T]he general rule [is] that the application of an exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act is a matter of affirmative defense on which the employer has the burden of proof\"). This focus makes the principle of construction the more instructive in ADEA cases: \"[i]n enacting the ADEA, Congress exhibited both a detailed knowledge of the FLSA provisions and their judicial interpretation and a willingness to depart from those provisions regarded as undesirable or inappropriate for incorporation,\" <i>Lorillard v. Pons,</i> 434 U.S. 575, 581, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978). And we have remarked and relied on the \"significant indication of Congress' intent in its directive that the ADEA be enforced in accordance with the `powers, remedies, and procedures' of the FLSA.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 580, 98 S.Ct. 866 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b); emphasis deleted); see also <i>Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc.,</i> 510 U.S. 517, 528, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994) (applying reasoning of <i>Lorillard</i>); <i>Thurston, supra,</i> at 126, 105 S.Ct. 613 (same). As against this interpretive background, there is no hint in the text that Congress meant \u00a7 623(f)(1) to march out of step with either the general or specifically FLSA default rules placing the burden of proving an exemption on the party claiming it.</p>\n<p>With these principles and prior cases in mind, we find it impossible to look at the text and structure of the ADEA and imagine that the RFOA clause works differently from the BFOQ clause next to it. Both exempt otherwise illegal conduct by reference to a further item of proof, thereby creating a defense for which the burden of persuasion falls on the \"one who claims its benefits,\" <i>Morton Salt Co., supra,</i> at 44-45, 68 S.Ct. 822, the \"party seeking relief,\" <i>Schaffer, supra,</i> at 57-58, 126 S.Ct. 528, and here, \"the employer,\" <i>Corning Glass Works, supra,</i> at 196, 94 S.Ct. 2223.</p>\n<p>If there were any doubt, the stress of the idiom \"otherwise prohibited,\" prefacing the BFOQ and RFOA conditions, would dispel it.<sup>[9]</sup> The implication of affirmative defense is underscored by contrasting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2402</span> \u00a7 623(f)(1) with the section of the ADEA at issue in <i>Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts,</i> 492 U.S. 158, 109 S.Ct. 2854, 106 L.Ed.2d 134 (1989), and by the way Congress responded to our decision there. In <i>Betts,</i> we said the issue was whether a provision in a former version of \u00a7 623(f)(2), one about employee benefit plans, merely \"redefine[d] the elements of a plaintiff's prima facie case,\" or instead \"establish[ed] a defense\" to what \"otherwise would be a violation of the Act.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 181, 109 S.Ct. 2854.<sup>[10]</sup> Although the provision contained no \"otherwise prohibited\" kind of language, we said that it \"appears on first reading to describe an affirmative defense.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We nonetheless thought that this more natural view (which we had taken in <i>Thurston</i>) was overridden by evidence of legislative history, by the peculiarity of a pretext-revealing condition in the phrasing of the provision (that a benefit plan \"not [be] a subterfuge to evade the purposes\" of the ADEA), and by the parallel with a prior case construing an \"analogous provision of Title VII\" (analogous because it also contained a pretext-revealing condition). 492 U.S., at 181, 109 S.Ct. 2854. A year later, however, Congress responded to <i>Betts</i> by enacting the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Pub.L. 101-433, 104 Stat. 978, avowedly to \"restore the original congressional intent\" that the ADEA's benefits provision be read as an affirmative defense, <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 101. What is instructive on the question at hand is that, in clarifying that \u00a7 623(f)(2) specifies affirmative defenses, Congress not only set the burden in so many words but also added the phrase \"otherwise prohibited\" as a part of the preface (just as in the text of \u00a7 623(f)(1)).<sup>[11]</sup> Congress thus confirmed the natural implication that we find in the \"otherwise prohibited\" language in \u00a7 623(f)(1): it refers to an excuse or justification for behavior that, standing alone, violates the statute's prohibition. The amendment in the aftermath of <i>Betts</i> shows that Congress understands the phrase the same way we naturally read it, as a clear signal that a defense to what is \"otherwise prohibited\" is an affirmative defense, entirely the responsibility of the party raising it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Knolls ventures that, regardless, the RFOA provision should be read as mere <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2403</span> elaboration on an element of liability. Because it bars liability where action is taken for reasons \"other than age,\" the argument goes, the provision must be directed not at justifying age discrimination by proof of some extenuating fact but at negating the premise of liability under \u00a7 623(a)(2), \"because of age.\"</p>\n<p>The answer to this argument, however, is <i>City of Jackson,</i> where we confirmed that the prohibition in \u00a7 623(a)(2) extends to practices with a disparate impact, inferring this result in part from the presence of the RFOA provision at issue here.<sup>[12]</sup> We drew on the recognized distinction between disparate-treatment and disparate-impact forms of liability, and explained that \"the very definition of disparate impact\" was that \"an employer who classifies his employees without respect to age may still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classification adversely affects the employee because of that employee's age.\" 544 U.S., at 236, n. 6, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 243, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (expressing agreement with \"all of the Court's reasoning\" in the plurality opinion, but finding it a basis for deference to the EEOC rather than for independent judicial decision). We emphasized that these were the kinds of employer activities, \"otherwise prohibited\" by \u00a7 623(a)(2), that were mainly what the statute meant to test against the RFOA condition: because \"[i]n disparate-impact cases . . . the allegedly `otherwise prohibited' activity is not based on age,\" it is \"in cases involving disparate-impact claims that the RFOA provision plays its principal role by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factor that was `reasonable.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 239, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>Thus, in <i>City of Jackson,</i> we made it clear that in the typical disparate-impact case, the employer's practice is \"without respect to age\" and its adverse impact (though \"because of age\") is \"attributable to a nonage factor\"; so action based on a \"factor other than age\" is the very premise for disparate-impact liability in the first place, not a negation of it or a defense to it. The RFOA defense in a disparate-impact case, then, is not focused on the asserted fact that a non-age factor was at work; we assume it was. The focus of the defense is that the factor relied upon was a \"reasonable\" one for the employer to be using. Reasonableness is a justification categorically distinct from the factual condition \"because of age\" and not necessarily correlated with it in any particular way: a reasonable factor may lean more heavily on older workers, as against younger ones, and an unreasonable factor might do just the opposite.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2404</span> III</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals majority rejected the affirmative defense reading and arrived at its position on the burden of proof question by a different route: because it read our decision in <i>City of Jackson</i> as ruling out the so-called \"business necessity\" enquiry in ADEA cases, the court concluded that the RFOA defense \"replaces\" it and therefore must conform to its burden of persuasion resting on the complaining party. But the court's premise (that <i>City of Jackson</i> modified the \"business necessity\" enquiry) is mistaken; this alone would be reason enough to reject its approach. And although we are now satisfied that the business necessity test should have no place in ADEA disparate-impact cases, we agree with the Government that this conclusion does not stand in the way of our holding that the RFOA exemption is an affirmative defense. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 25-27.</p>\n<p>To begin with, when the Court of Appeals further inferred from the <i>City of Jackson</i> reference to <i>Wards Cove</i> that the <i>Wards Cove</i> burden of persuasion (on the employee, for the business necessity enquiry) also applied to the RFOA defense, it gave short shrift to the reasons set out in Part II-A, <i>supra,</i> for reading RFOA as an affirmative defense (with the burden on the employer). But we think that even on its own terms, <i>City of Jackson</i> falls short of supporting the Court of Appeals's conclusion.</p>\n<p>Although <i>City of Jackson</i> contains the statement that \"<i>Wards Cove</i>'s pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII's identical language remains applicable to the ADEA,\" 544 U.S., at 240, 125 S.Ct. 1536, <i>City of Jackson</i> made only two specific references to aspects of the <i>Wards Cove</i> interpretation of Title VII that might have \"remain[ed] applicable\" in ADEA cases. One was to the existence of disparate-impact liability, which <i>City of Jackson</i> explained was narrower in ADEA cases than under Title VII. The other was to a plaintiff-employee's burden of identifying which particular practices allegedly cause an observed disparate impact, which is the employee's burden under both the ADEA and the pre-1991 Title VII. See 544 U.S., at 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536. Neither of these references, of course, is at odds with the view of RFOA as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>If, indeed, <i>City of Jackson</i>'s reference to <i>Wards Cove</i> could be read literally to include other aspects of the latter case, beyond what mattered in <i>City of Jackson</i> itself, the untoward consequences of the broader reading would rule it out. One such consequence is embraced by Meacham, who argues both that the Court of Appeals was wrong to place the burden of persuasion for the RFOA defense on the employee, and that the court was right in thinking that <i>City of Jackson</i> adopted the <i>Wards Cove</i> burden of persuasion on what Meacham views as one element of an ADEA impact claim. For Meacham takes the position that an impact plaintiff like himself has to negate business necessity in order to show that the employer's actions were \"otherwise prohibited\"; only then does the RFOA (with the burden of persuasion on the employer) have a role to play. To apply both tests, however, would force the parties to develop (and the court or jury to follow) two overlapping enquiries: first, whether the employment practice at issue (based on a factor other than <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2405</span> age) is supported by a business justification; and second, whether that factor is a reasonable one. Depending on how the first enquiry proceeds, a plaintiff might directly contest the force of the employer's rationale, or else try to show that the employer invoked it as a pretext by pointing (for example) to alternative practices with less of a disparate impact. See <i>Wards Cove,</i> 490 U.S., at 658, 109 S.Ct. 2115 (\"first, a consideration of the justifications an employer offers for his use of these practices; and second, the availability of alternative practices to achieve the same business ends, with less racial impact\"); see also <i>id.,</i> at 658-661, 109 S.Ct. 2115. But even if the plaintiff succeeded at one or the other, in Meacham's scheme the employer could still avoid liability by proving reasonableness.</p>\n<p>Here is what is so strange: as the Government says, \"[i]f disparate-impact plaintiffs have already established that a challenged practice is a pretext for intentional age discrimination, it makes little sense then to ask whether the discriminatory practice is based on reasonable factors <i>other than age.</i>\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 26 (emphasis in original). Conversely, proving the reasonableness defense would eliminate much of the point a plaintiff would have had for showing alternatives in the first place: why make the effort to show alternative practices with a less discriminatory effect (and besides, how would that prove pretext?), when everyone knows that the choice of a practice relying on a \"reasonable\" non-age factor is good enough to avoid liability?<sup>[14]</sup> At the very least, developing the reasonableness defense would be substantially redundant with the direct contest over the force of the business justification, especially when both enquiries deal with the same, narrowly specified practice. It is not very fair to take the remark about <i>Wards Cove</i> in <i>City of Jackson</i> as requiring such a wasteful and confusing structure of proof.</p>\n<p>Nor is there any good way to read the same line from <i>City of Jackson</i> as implying that the burden of proving any business-related defense falls on the plaintiff; most obviously, this would entail no longer taking the BFOQ clause to be an affirmative defense, which <i>City of Jackson</i> confirmed that it is, see 544 U.S., at 233, n. 3, 125 S.Ct. 1536. What is more, <i>City of Jackson</i> could not have had the RFOA clause in mind as \"identical\" to anything in Title VII (for which a <i>Wards Cove</i>'s reading might be adopted), for that statute has no like-worded defense. And as <i>Wards Cove</i> did not purport to construe any statutory defenses under Title VII, only an over-reading of <i>City of Jackson</i> would find lurking in it an assumption that <i>Wards Cove</i> has anything to say about statutory defenses in the ADEA (never mind one that Title VII does not have).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>As mentioned, where <i>City of Jackson</i> did get help from our prior reading of Title VII was in relying on <i>Wards Cove</i> to repeat that a plaintiff falls short by merely alleging a disparate impact, or \"point[ing] to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact.\" <i>City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S., at 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536. The plaintiff is obliged to do more: to \"isolat[e] and identif[y] the <i>specific</i> employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2406</span> <i>Wards Cove, supra,</i> at 656, 109 S.Ct. 2115; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted). The aim of this requirement, as <i>City of Jackson</i> said, is to avoid the \"result [of] employers being potentially liable for `the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances.'\" 544 U.S., at 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (quoting <i>Wards Cove, supra,</i> at 657, 109 S.Ct. 2115; some internal quotation marks omitted). And as the outcome in that case shows, the requirement has bite: one sufficient reason for rejecting the employees' challenge was that they \"ha[d] done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue [was] relatively less generous to older workers than to younger workers,\" and \"ha[d] not identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that ha[d] an adverse impact on older workers.\" <i>City of Jackson, supra,</i> at 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536.</p>\n<p>Identifying a specific practice is not a trivial burden, and it ought to allay some of the concern raised by Knolls's <i>amici,</i> who fear that recognizing an employer's burden of persuasion on an RFOA defense to impact claims will encourage strike suits or nudge plaintiffs with marginal cases into court, in turn inducing employers to alter business practices in order to avoid being sued. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for General Electric Co. as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 18-31. It is also to the point that the only thing at stake in this case is the gap between production and persuasion; nobody is saying that even the burden of production should be placed on the plaintiff. Cf. <i>Schaffer,</i> 546 U.S., at 56, 126 S.Ct. 528 (burden of persuasion answers \"which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced\"); <i>id.,</i> at 58, 126 S.Ct. 528 (\"In truth, however, very few cases will be in evidentiary equipoise\"). And the more plainly reasonable the employer's \"factor other than age\" is, the shorter the step for that employer from producing evidence raising the defense, to persuading the factfinder that the defense is meritorious. It will be mainly in cases where the reasonableness of the non-age factor is obscure for some reason, that the employer will have more evidence to reveal and more convincing to do in going from production to persuasion.</p>\n<p>That said, there is no denying that putting employers to the work of persuading factfinders that their choices are reasonable makes it harder and costlier to defend than if employers merely bore the burden of production; nor do we doubt that this will sometimes affect the way employers do business with their employees. But at the end of the day, <i>amici</i>'s concerns have to be directed at Congress, which set the balance where it is, by both creating the RFOA exemption and writing it in the orthodox format of an affirmative defense. We have to read it the way Congress wrote it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>As we have said before, Congress took account of the distinctive nature of age discrimination, and the need to preserve a fair degree of leeway for employment decisions with effects that correlate with age, when it put the RFOA clause into the ADEA, \"significantly narrow[ing] its coverage.\" <i>City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S., at 233, 125 S.Ct. 1536. And as the outcome for the employer in <i>City of Jackson</i> shows, \"it is not surprising that certain employment criteria that are routinely used may be reasonable despite their adverse impact on older workers as a group.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536. In this case, we realize that the Court of Appeals showed no hesitation in finding that Knolls prevailed on the RFOA defense, though the court expressed its conclusion in terms of Meacham's failure to meet the burden of persuasion. Whether the outcome should be any different when the burden is properly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2407</span> placed on the employer is best left to that court in the first instance. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice BREYER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I do not join the majority opinion because the Court answers for itself two questions that Congress has left to the sound judgment of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. As represented by the Solicitor General of the United States in a brief signed by the Commission's General Counsel, the Commission takes the position that the reasonable-factor-other-than-age provision is an affirmative defense on which the employer bears the burden of proof, and that, in disparate-impact suits brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), that provision replaces the business-necessity test of <i>Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,</i> 490 U.S. 642, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989).</p>\n<p>Neither position was contrived just for this case. Indeed, the Commission has arguably held its view on the burden-of-proof point for nearly 30 years. See 44 Fed.Reg. 68858, 68861 (1979). Although its regulation applied only to cases involving \"discriminatory treatment,\" 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(e) (2007), even if that covers only disparate treatment, see <i>ante,</i> at 2401-2402, n. 9, the logic of its extension to disparate-impact claims is obvious and unavoidable. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16, n. 1. At the very least, the regulation does not contradict the Commission's current position: It does not say that the employer bears the burden of proof <i>only</i> in discriminatory-treatment cases.</p>\n<p>The Commission's view on the business-necessity test is newly minted, but that does not undermine it. The Commission has never expressed the contrary view that the factfinder must consider both business necessity <i>and</i> reasonableness when an employer applies a factor that has a disparate impact on older workers. In fact, before <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S. 228, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005), the Commission had not even considered the relationship between the two standards, because it used to treat the two as <i>identical.</i> See 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(d). After <i>City of Jackson</i> rejected that equation, see 544 U.S., at 243, 125 S.Ct. 1536, the Commission decided that the business-necessity standard plays no role in ADEA disparate-impact claims, see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 25-27, and has even proposed new rules setting forth that position, see 73 Fed.Reg. 16807-16809 (2008).</p>\n<p>Because administration of the ADEA has been placed in the hands of the Commission, and because the agency's positions on the questions before us are unquestionably reasonable (as the Court's opinion ably shows), I defer to the agency's views. See <i>Raymond B. Yates, M. D., P.C. Profit Sharing Plan v. Hendon,</i> 541 U.S. 1, 24-25, 124 S.Ct. 1330, 158 L.Ed.2d 40 (2004) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). I therefore concur in the Court's judgment to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I write separately to note that I continue to believe that disparate-impact claims are not cognizable under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <i>et seq.</i> See <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S. 228, 247-268, 125 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2408</span> 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005) (O'Connor, J., joined by KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ., concurring in judgment). Moreover, I disagree with the Court's statement that the \"reasonable factors other than age\" (RFOA) exception, \u00a7 623(f)(1), is principally relevant in disparate-impact cases. Compare <i>City of Jackson, supra,</i> at 251-253, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (opinion concurring in judgment), with <i>ante,</i> at 2402-2403 (citing <i>City of Jackson, supra,</i> at 239, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (plurality opinion)). I therefore join only Parts I and II-A of the Court's opinion because I agree that the RFOA exception is an affirmative defense\u0097when it arises in disparate-treatment cases. Here, although the Court of Appeals erred in placing the burden of proof on petitioners, I would nonetheless affirm because the only claims at issue are disparate-impact claims.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Naval Reactors program had lowered Knolls's staffing limit by 108 people; as Knolls also had to hire 35 new employees for work existing personnel could not do, a total of 143 jobs would have to go.</p>\n<p>[2]  The \"performance\" score was based on the worker's two most recent appraisals. The \"flexibility\" instruction read: \"Rate the employee's flexibility within the Laboratory. Can his or her documented skills be used in other assignments that will add value to current or future Lab work? Is the employee retrainable for other Lab assignments?\" The \"critical skills\" instruction read: \"How critical are the employee's skills to continuing work in the Lab? Is the individual's skill a <i>key</i> technical resource for the [Naval Reactors] program? Is the skill readily accessible within the Lab or generally available from the external market?\" App. 94-95 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>[3]  For comparison: after the voluntary buyouts, 1,203 out of 2,063 salaried workers (or 58%) were at least 40 years old; and of the 245 who were at risk of involuntary layoff, and therefore included in the rankings scheme, 179 (or 73%) were 40 or over. <i>Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory,</i> 185 F.Supp.2d 193, 203 (N.D.N.Y.2002).</p>\n<p>[4]  The expert cut the data in different ways, showing the chances to be 1 in 348,000 (based on a population of all 2,063 salaried workers); 1 in 1,260 (based on a population of the 245 workers at risk of layoff); or 1 in 6,639 (when the analysis was broken down by sections of the company). <i>Meacham I,</i> 381 F.3d, at 64-65.</p>\n<p>[5]  Taking the <i>Wards Cove</i> steps in turn, the Court of Appeals concluded that the \"jury could have found that the degree of subjective decision making allowed in the [layoff procedure] created the disparity,\" 381 F.3d, at 74; that the employer had answered with evidence of a \"facially legitimate business justification,\" a need \"to reduce its workforce while still retaining employees with skills critical to the performance of [Knolls's] functions,\" <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted); and that petitioners would prevail nonetheless because \"[a]t least one suitable alternative is clear from the record,\" that Knolls \"could have designed [a procedure] with more safeguards against subjectivity, in particular, tests for criticality and flexibility that are less vulnerable to managerial bias,\" <i>id.,</i> at 75.</p>\n<p>[6]  Distinguishing the two tests mattered, the Court of Appeals explained, because even though \"[t]here may have been other reasonable ways for [Knolls] to achieve its goals (as we held in <i>[Meacham I]</i>), . . . the one selected was not unreasonable.\" <i>Meacham II,</i> 461 F.3d, at 146 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The burden of persuasion for either test was said to fall on the plaintiff, however, because \"the employer is not to bear the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to the legitimacy of its business justification.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 142 (citing <i>Wards Cove,</i> 490 U.S., at 659-660, 109 S.Ct. 2115; internal quotation marks omitted). The majority took note of the textual signs that the RFOA was an affirmative defense, but set them aside because \"<i>City of Jackson</i> . . . emphasized that there are reasonable and permissible employment criteria that correlate with age,\" thereby leaving it to plaintiffs to prove that a criterion is not reasonable. 461 F.3d, at 142-143.</p>\n<p>[7]  In Judge Pooler's view, a jury \"could permissibly find that defendants had not established a RFOA based on the unmonitored subjectivity of [Knolls's] plan as implemented.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 153 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>[8]  Petitioners also sought certiorari as to \"[w]hether respondents' practice of conferring broad discretionary authority upon individual managers to decide which employees to lay off during a reduction in force constituted a `reasonable factor other than age' as a matter of law.\" Pet. for Cert. i. We denied certiorari on this question and express no views on it here.</p>\n<p>[9]  We do not need to seek further relief from doubt by looking to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations on burdens of proof in ADEA cases. The parties focus on two of them, but we think neither clearly answers the question here. One of them the Government has disavowed as overtaken by our decision in <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S. 228, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005), Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16, n. 1 (noting that 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(d) (2007) \"takes a position that does not survive\" <i>City of Jackson</i>), for the regulation seems to require a showing of business necessity as a part of the RFOA defense. Compare 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(d) (\"When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment . . . on the grounds that it is a `factor other than' age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity\"), with <i>City of Jackson, supra,</i> at 243, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (\"Unlike the business necessity test, which asks whether there are other ways for the employer to achieve its goals that do not result in a disparate impact on a protected class, the reasonableness inquiry includes no such requirement\"). And the second regulation would take a bit of stretching to cover disparate-impact cases, for its text speaks in terms of disparate treatment. See 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(e) (concerning use of the RFOA defense against an \"individual claim of discriminatory treatment\"). The EEOC has lately proposed rulemaking that would revise both of these regulations, eliminating any reference to \"business necessity\" and placing the burden of proof on the employer \"[w]henever the exception of `a reasonable factor other than age' is raised.\" 73 Fed.Reg. 16807-16809 (Mar. 31, 2008) (proposed 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(e)).</p>\n<p>[10]  The provision read: \"It shall not be unlawful for an employer . . . to observe the terms of . . . any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter . . . because of the age of such individual.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(2) (1982 ed.).</p>\n<p>[11]  Congress surely could not have meant this phrase to contradict its express allocation of the burden, in the same amendment. But that would be the upshot of Knolls's suggestion that the only way to read the word \"otherwise\" as not redundant in the phrase \"otherwise prohibited under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (e)\" is to say that the word must refer only to \u00a7 623(f)(1) itself, implying that \u00a7 623(f)(1) must be a liability-creating provision for which the burden falls on the plaintiff. Brief for Respondents 33, and n. 7. Besides, this argument proves too much, for it implies that even the BFOQ exemption is not an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>[12]  In doing so, we expressly rejected the so-called \"safe harbor\" view of the RFOA provision. See <i>City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S., at 238-239, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 252-253, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (describing \"safe harbor\" view).</p>\n<p>[13]  The factual causation that \u00a7 623(a)(2) describes as practices that \"deprive or tend to deprive . . . or otherwise adversely affect [employees]. . . because of . . . age\" is typically shown by looking to data revealing the impact of a given practice on actual employees. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S., at 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (opinion of the Court); cf. <i>Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,</i> 490 U.S. 642, 657, 658-659, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989) (under Title VII, \"specific causation\" is shown, and a \"prima facie case\" is \"establish[ed],\" when plaintiff identifies a specific employment practice linked to a statistical disparity); <i>Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust,</i> 487 U.S. 977, 995, 108 S.Ct. 2777, 101 L.Ed.2d 827 (1988) (plurality opinion) (in Title VII cases, \"statistical disparities must be sufficiently substantial that they raise . . . an inference of causation\").\n</p>\n<p>This enquiry would be muddled if the value, \"reasonableness,\" were to become a factor artificially boosting or discounting the factual strength of the causal link, or the extent of the measured impact. It would open the door to incoherent undershooting, for example, if defendants were heard to say that an impact is \"somewhat less correlated with age, seeing as the factor is a reasonable one\"; and it would be overshooting to make them show that the impact is \"not correlated with age, and the factor is reasonable, besides.\"</p>\n<p>[14]  See <i>City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S., at 243, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (\"While there may have been other reasonable ways for the City to achieve its goals, the one selected was not unreasonable.

KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABO-\n        RATORY, AKA KAPL, INC., ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 06\u20131505. Argued April 23, 2008\u2014Decided June 19, 2008\nWhen the National Government ordered its contractor, respondent\n Knolls, to reduce its work force, Knolls had its managers score their\n subordinates on \u201cperformance,\u201d \u201cflexibility,\u201d and \u201ccritical skills\u201d;\n these scores, along with points for years of service, were used to de-\n termine who was laid off. Of the 31 employees let go, 30 were at least\n 40 years old. Petitioners (Meacham, for short) were among those laid\n off, and they filed this suit asserting, inter alia, a disparate-impact\n claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967\n (ADEA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7621 et seq. To show such an impact, Meacham\n relied on a statistical expert\u2019s testimony that results so skewed ac-\n cording to age could rarely occur by chance; and that the scores for\n \u201cflexibility\u201d and \u201ccriticality,\u201d over which managers had the most dis-\n cretionary judgment, had the firmest statistical ties to the outcomes.\n The jury found for Meacham on the disparate-impact claim, and the\n Second Circuit initially affirmed. This Court vacated the judgment\n and remanded in light of its intervening decision in Smith v. City of\n Jackson, 544 U. S. 228. The Second Circuit then held for Knolls,\n finding its prior ruling untenable because it had applied a \u201cbusiness\n necessity\u201d standard rather than a \u201creasonableness\u201d test in assessing\n the employer\u2019s reliance on factors other than age in the layoff deci-\n sions, and because Meacham had not carried the burden of persua-\n sion as to the reasonableness of Knolls\u2019s non-age factors.\nHeld: An employer defending a disparate-impact claim under the\n ADEA bears both the burden of production and the burden of persua-\n sion for the \u201creasonable factors other than age\u201d (RFOA) affirmative\n defense under \u00a7623(f)(1). Pp. 5\u201317.\n    (a) The ADEA\u2019s text and structure indicate that the RFOA exemp-\n2       MEACHAM v. KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABORATORY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion creates an affirmative defense, for which the burden of persua-\n    sion falls on the employer. The RFOA exemption is listed alongside\n    one for bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQ), which the Court\n    has recognized to be an affirmative defense: \u201cIt shall not be unlawful\n    for an employer . . . to take any action otherwise prohibited under\n    subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e) . . . where age is a [BFOQ] reasonably\n    necessary to the normal operation of the particular business, or\n    where the differentiation is based on [RFOA] . . . .\u201d \u00a7623(f)(1). Given\n    that the statute lays out its exemptions in a provision separate from\n    the general prohibitions in \u00a7\u00a7623(a)\u2013(c), (e), and expressly refers to\n    the prohibited conduct as such, it is no surprise that this Court has\n    spoken of both the BFOQ and RFOA as being among the ADEA\u2019s\n    \u201cfive affirmative defenses,\u201d Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston,\n    469 U. S. 111, 122. This reading follows the familiar principle that\n    \u201c[w]hen a proviso . . . carves an exception out of the body of a statute\n    or contract those who set up such exception must prove it,\u201d Javierre\n    v. Central Altagracia, 217 U. S. 502, 508. As this longstanding con-\n    vention is part of the backdrop against which the Congress writes\n    laws, the Court respects it unless there is compelling reason to think\n    that Congress put the burden of persuasion on the other side. See\n    Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 57\u201358. The Court has given this\n    principle particular weight in enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act\n    of 1968, Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U. S. 188, 196\u2013197;\n    and it has also recognized that \u201cthe ADEA [is] enforced in accordance\n    with the \u2018powers, remedies, and procedures\u2019 of the FLSA,\u201d Lorillard\n    v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580. Nothing in \u00a7623(f)(1) suggests that Con-\n    gress meant it to march out of step with either the general or specifi-\n    cally FLSA default rules placing the burden of proving an exemption\n    on the party claiming it. Any further doubt would be dispelled by the\n    natural implication of the \u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d language prefacing\n    the BFOQ and RFOA defenses. Pp. 5\u20139.\n       (b) Knolls argues that because the RFOA clause bars liability\n    where action is taken for reasons \u201cother than age,\u201d it should be read\n    as mere elaboration on an element of liability. But City of Jackson\n    confirmed that \u00a7623(a)(2)\u2019s prohibition extends to practices with a\n    disparate impact, inferring this result in part from the presence of\n    the RFOA provision. 544 U. S., at 239, 243. And City of Jackson\n    made it clear that action based on a \u201cfactor other than age\u201d is the\n    very premise for disparate-impact liability, not a negation of it or a\n    defense to it. Thus, it is assumed that a non-age factor was at work\n    in such a case, and the focus of the RFOA defense is on whether the\n    factor relied on was \u201creasonable.\u201d Pp. 10\u201311.\n       (c) The business necessity test has no place in ADEA disparate-\n    impact cases; applying both that test and the RFOA defense would\n                      Cite as: 554 U.

The absence of a\n  business necessity enquiry does not diminish, however, the reasons\n  already given for reading the RFOA as an affirmative defense. City\n  of Jackson cannot be read as implying that the burden of proving any\n  business-related defense falls on the plaintiff, for it confirmed that\n  the BFOQ is an affirmative defense, see 544 U. S., at 233, n. 3. More-\n  over, in referring to \u201cWards Cove\u2019s interpretation of identical lan-\n  guage [in Title VII],\u201d City of Jackson could not have had the RFOA\n  clause in mind, for Title VII has no like-worded defense. And as\n  Wards Cove did not purport to construe any Title VII defenses, only\n  an over-reading of City of Jackson would find in it an assumption\n  that Wards Cove has anything to say about statutory defenses in the\n  ADEA. Pp. 12\u201315.\n     (d) City of Jackson confirmed that an ADEA disparate-impact\n  plaintiff must \u201c \u2018 \u201cisolat[e] and identif[y] the specific employment prac-\n  tices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical dis-\n  parities.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 544 U. S., at 241. This is not a trivial burden, and it\n  ought to allay some of the concern that recognizing an employer\u2019s\n  burden of persuasion on an RFOA defense will encourage strike suits\n  or nudge plaintiffs with marginal cases into court; but in the end,\n  such concerns have to be directed at Congress, which set the balance\n  by both creating the RFOA exemption and writing it in the orthodox\n  format of an affirmative defense.

C.\n\u00a7621 et seq., creates an exemption for employer actions\n\u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d by the ADEA but \u201cbased on reason-\nable factors other than age\u201d (RFOA). \u00a7623(f)(1). The\nquestion is whether an employer facing a disparate-impact\nclaim and planning to defend on the basis of RFOA must\nnot only produce evidence raising the defense, but also\npersuade the factfinder of its merit. We hold that the\nemployer must do both.\n                          I\n  The National Government pays private companies to\ndo some of the work maintaining the Nation\u2019s fleet of\nnuclear-powered warships.     One such contractor is\nrespondent KAPL, Inc. (Knolls), the operator of the\nGovernment\u2019s Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, which\nhas a history dating back to the first nuclear-powered\nsubmarines in the 1950s. The United States Navy and\nthe Department of Energy jointly fund Knolls\u2019s opera-\n2       MEACHAM v. KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABORATORY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntions, decide what projects it should pursue, and set its\nannual staffing limits. In recent years, Knolls has been\ncharged with designing prototype naval nuclear reactors\nand with training Navy personnel to run them.\n   The demands for naval nuclear reactors changed with\nthe end of the Cold War, and for fiscal year 1996 Knolls\nwas ordered to reduce its work force. Even after a hun-\ndred or so employees chose to take the company\u2019s ensuing\nbuyout offer, Knolls was left with thirty-some jobs to cut.1\nPetitioners (Meacham, for short) are among those laid off\nin the resulting \u201cinvoluntary reduction in force.\u201d In order\nto select those for layoff, Knolls told its managers to score\ntheir subordinates on three scales, \u201cperformance,\u201d \u201cflexi-\nbility,\u201d and \u201ccritical skills.\u201d2 The scores were summed,\nalong with points for years of service, and the totals de-\ntermined who should be let go.\n   Of the 31 salaried employees laid off, 30 were at least 40\nyears old.3 Twenty-eight of them sued, raising both dispa-\nrate-treatment (discriminatory intent) and disparate-\nimpact (discriminatory result) claims under the ADEA and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 TheNaval Reactors program had lowered Knolls\u2019s staffing limit by\n108 people; as Knolls also had to hire 35 new employees for work\nexisting personnel could not do, a total of 143 jobs would have to go.\n   2 The \u201cperformance\u201d score was based on the worker\u2019s two most recent\n\nappraisals. The \u201cflexibility\u201d instruction read: \u201cRate the employee\u2019s\nflexibility within the Laboratory. Can his or her documented skills be\nused in other assignments that will add value to current or future Lab\nwork? Is the employee retrainable for other Lab assignments?\u201d The\n\u201ccritical skills\u201d instruction read: \u201cHow critical are the employee\u2019s skills\nto continuing work in the Lab? Is the individual\u2019s skill a key technical\nresource for the [Naval Reactors] program? Is the skill readily accessi-\nble within the Lab or generally available from the external market?\u201d\nApp. 94\u201395 (emphasis in original).\n   3 For comparison: after the voluntary buyouts, 1,203 out of 2,063\n\nsalaried workers (or 58%) were at least 40 years old; and of the 245 who\nwere at risk of involuntary layoff, and therefore included in the rank-\nings scheme, 179 (or 73%) were 40 or over.

S. ____ (2008)                       3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nstate law, alleging that Knolls \u201cdesigned and implemented\nits workforce reduction process to eliminate older employ-\nees and that, regardless of intent, the process had a dis-\ncriminatory impact on ADEA-protected employees.\u201d\nMeacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, 381 F. 3d\n56, 61 (CA2 2004) (Meacham I). To show a disparate\nimpact, the workers relied on a statistical expert\u2019s testi-\nmony to the effect that results so skewed according to age\ncould rarely occur by chance;4 and that the scores for\n\u201cflexibility\u201d and \u201ccriticality,\u201d over which managers had the\nmost discretionary judgment, had the firmest statistical\nties to the outcomes. Id., at 65.\n   The jury found for Meacham on the disparate-impact\nclaim (but not on the disparate-treatment claim). The\nCourt of Appeals affirmed, after examining the verdict\nthrough the lens of the so-called \u201cburden shifting\u201d scheme\nof inference spelled out in Wards Cove Packing Co. v.\nAtonio, 490 U. S. 642 (1989). See Meacham I, supra, at\n74\u201376.5 After Knolls sought certiorari, we vacated the\njudgment and remanded for further proceedings in light of\nSmith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228 (2005), decided\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The expert cut the data in different ways, showing the chances to be\n\n1 in 348,000 (based on a population of all 2,063 salaried workers); 1 in\n1,260 (based on a population of the 245 workers at risk of layoff); or 1 in\n6,639 (when the analysis was broken down by sections of the company).\nMeacham I, 381 F. 3d, at 64\u201365.\n   5 Taking the Wards Cove steps in turn, the Court of Appeals con-\n\ncluded that the \u201cjury could have found that the degree of subjective\ndecision making allowed in the [layoff procedure] created the disparity,\u201d\n381 F. 3d, at 74; that the employer had answered with evidence of a\n\u201cfacially legitimate business justification,\u201d a need \u201cto reduce its work-\nforce while still retaining employees with skills critical to the perform-\nance of [Knolls\u2019s] functions,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted);\nand that petitioners would prevail nonetheless because \u201c[a]t least one\nsuitable alternative is clear from the record,\u201d that Knolls \u201ccould have\ndesigned [a procedure] with more safeguards against subjectivity, in\nparticular, tests for criticality and flexibility that are less vulnerable to\nmanagerial bias,\u201d id., at 75.\n4     MEACHAM v. KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABORATORY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nwhile Knolls\u2019s petition was pending. See 544 U. S. 957\n(2005).\n  On remand, the same Court of Appeals panel ruled in\nfavor of Knolls, over a dissent. 461 F. 3d 134 (CA2 2006)\n(case below) (Meacham II). The majority found its prior\nruling \u201cuntenable\u201d because it had applied the Wards Cove\n\u201cbusiness necessity\u201d standard rather than a \u201creasonable-\nness\u201d test, contrary to City of Jackson; and on the latter\nstandard, Meacham, the employee, had not carried the\nburden of persuasion. 461 F.3d, at 140\u2013141, 144.6 In\ndissent, Judge Pooler took issue with the majority for\nconfusing business justifications under Wards Cove with\nthe statutory RFOA exemption, which she read to be an\naffirmative defense with the burden of persuasion falling\non defendants. 461 F.3d, at 147, 149\u2013152.7\n  Meacham sought certiorari, noting conflicting decisions\nassigning the burden of persuasion on the reasonableness\nof the factor other than age; the Court of Appeals in this\ncase placed it on the employee (to show the non-age factor\nunreasonable), but the Ninth Circuit in Criswell v. West-\nern Airlines, Inc., 709 F. 2d 544, 552 (1983), had assigned\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Distinguishing the two tests mattered, the Court of Appeals ex-\n\nplained, because even though \u201c[t]here may have been other reasonable\nways for [Knolls] to achieve its goals (as we held in [Meacham I]), . . .\nthe one selected was not unreasonable.\u201d Meacham II, 461 F. 3d, at 146\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The burden of persua-\nsion for either test was said to fall on the plaintiff, however, because\n\u201cthe employer is not to bear the ultimate burden of persuasion with\nrespect to the legitimacy of its business justification.\u201d Id., at 142 (citing\nWards Cove, 490 U. S., at 659\u2013660; internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe majority took note of the textual signs that the RFOA was an\naffirmative defense, but set them aside because \u201cCity of Jackson . . .\nemphasized that there are reasonable and permissible employment\ncriteria that correlate with age,\u201d thereby leaving it to plaintiffs to prove\nthat a criterion is not reasonable. 461 F.3d, at 142\u2013143.\n   7 In Judge Pooler\u2019s view, a jury \u201ccould permissibly find that defen-\n\ndants had not established a RFOA based on the unmonitored subjectiv-\nity of [Knolls\u2019s] plan as implemented.\u201d Id., at 153 (dissenting opinion).\n                      Cite as: 554 U.

In fact it was in Criswell that we first took up this\nquestion, only to find it not well posed in that case. West-\nern Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell, 472 U. S. 400, 408, n. 10\n(1985). We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), and\nnow vacate the judgment of the Second Circuit and\nremand.8\n                              II\n                              A\n   The ADEA\u2019s general prohibitions against age discrimi-\nnation, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7623(a)\u2013(c), (e), are subject to a sepa-\nrate provision, \u00a7623(f), creating exemptions for employer\npractices \u201cotherwise prohibited under subsections (a), (b),\n(c), or (e).\u201d The RFOA exemption is listed in \u00a7623(f) along-\nside one for bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQ):\n\u201cIt shall not be unlawful for an employer . . . to take any\naction otherwise prohibited under subsections (a), (b), (c),\nor (e) . . . where age is a bona fide occupational qualifica-\ntion reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the\nparticular business, or where the differentiation is based\non reasonable factors other than age . . . .\u201d \u00a7623(f)(1).\n   Given how the statute reads, with exemptions laid out\napart from the prohibitions (and expressly referring to the\nprohibited conduct as such), it is no surprise that we have\nalready spoken of the BFOQ and RFOA provisions as\nbeing among the ADEA\u2019s \u201cfive affirmative defenses,\u201d\nTrans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 122\n(1985). After looking at the statutory text, most lawyers\nwould accept that characterization as a matter of course,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 Petitioners also sought certiorari as to \u201c[w]hether respondents\u2019 prac-\n\ntice of conferring broad discretionary authority upon individual manag-\ners to decide which employees to lay off during a reduction in force\nconstituted a \u2018reasonable factor other than age\u2019 as a matter of law.\u201d\nPet. for Cert. i. We denied certiorari on this question and express no\nviews on it here.\n6    MEACHAM v. KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABORATORY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthanks to the familiar principle that \u201c[w]hen a proviso . . .\ncarves an exception out of the body of a statute or contract\nthose who set up such exception must prove it.\u201d Javierre\nv. Central Altagracia, 217 U. S. 502, 508 (1910) (opinion\nfor the Court by Holmes, J.); see also FTC v. Morton Salt\nCo., 334 U. S. 37, 44\u201345 (1948) (\u201c[T]he burden of proving\njustification or exemption under a special exception to the\nprohibitions of a statute generally rests on one who claims\nits benefits . . .\u201d); United States v. First City Nat. Bank of\nHouston, 386 U. S. 361, 366 (1967) (citing Morton Salt,\nsupra, at 44\u201345). That longstanding convention is part of\nthe backdrop against which the Congress writes laws, and\nwe respect it unless we have compelling reasons to think\nthat Congress meant to put the burden of persuasion on\nthe other side. See Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 57\u201358\n(2005) (\u201cAbsent some reason to believe that Congress\nintended otherwise, therefore, we will conclude that the\nburden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the\nparty seeking relief\u201d).\n   We have never been given any reason for a heterodox\ntake on the RFOA clause\u2019s nearest neighbor, and our prior\ncases recognize that the BFOQ clause establishes an\naffirmative defense against claims of disparate treatment.\nSee, e.g., City of Jackson, supra, at 233, n. 3; Western Air\nLines, Inc., supra, at 414\u2013419, and nn. 24, 29. We have\nlikewise given the affirmative defense construction to the\nexemption in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 for pay differen-\ntials based on \u201cany other factor other than sex,\u201d Corning\nGlass Works v. Brennan, 417 U. S. 188, 196 (1974) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted); and there, we took account\nof the particular weight given to the interpretive conven-\ntion already noted, when enforcing the Fair Labor Stan-\ndards Act of 1938 (FLSA), id., at 196\u2013197 (\u201c[T]he general\nrule [is] that the application of an exemption under the\nFair Labor Standards Act is a matter of affirmative de-\nfense on which the employer has the burden of proof\u201d).\n                    Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                  7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nThis focus makes the principle of construction the more\ninstructive in ADEA cases: \u201c[i]n enacting the ADEA, Con-\ngress exhibited both a detailed knowledge of the FLSA\nprovisions and their judicial interpretation and a willing-\nness to depart from those provisions regarded as undesir-\nable or inappropriate for incorporation,\u201d Lorillard v. Pons,\n434 U. S. 575, 581 (1978). And we have remarked and\nrelied on the \u201csignificant indication of Congress\u2019 intent in\nits directive that the ADEA be enforced in accordance with\nthe \u2018powers, remedies, and procedures\u2019 of the FLSA.\u201d Id.,\nat 580 (quoting 29 U. S. C. \u00a7626(b); emphasis deleted); see\nalso Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517, 528 (1994)\n(applying reasoning of Lorillard); Thurston, supra, at 126\n(same). As against this interpretive background, there is\nno hint in the text that Congress meant \u00a7623(f)(1) to\nmarch out of step with either the general or specifically\nFLSA default rules placing the burden of proving an ex-\nemption on the party claiming it.\n   With these principles and prior cases in mind, we find it\nimpossible to look at the text and structure of the ADEA\nand imagine that the RFOA clause works differently from\nthe BFOQ clause next to it. Both exempt otherwise illegal\nconduct by reference to a further item of proof, thereby\ncreating a defense for which the burden of persuasion falls\non the \u201cone who claims its benefits,\u201d Morton Salt Co.,\nsupra, at 44\u201345, the \u201cparty seeking relief,\u201d Schaffer, supra,\nat 57\u201358, and here, \u201cthe employer,\u201d Corning Glass Works,\nsupra, at 196.\n   If there were any doubt, the stress of the idiom \u201cother-\nwise prohibited,\u201d prefacing the BFOQ and RFOA condi-\ntions, would dispel it.9 The implication of affirmative\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 We do not need to seek further relief from doubt by looking to the\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations on\nburdens of proof in ADEA cases. The parties focus on two of them, but\nwe think neither clearly answers the question here. One of them the\nGovernment has disavowed as overtaken by our decision in Smith v.\n8     MEACHAM v. KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABORATORY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndefense is underscored by contrasting \u00a7623(f)(1) with the\nsection of the ADEA at issue in Public Employees Retire-\nment System of Ohio v. Betts, 492 U. S. 158 (1989), and by\nthe way Congress responded to our decision there. In\nBetts, we said the issue was whether a provision in a\nformer version of \u00a7623(f)(2), one about employee benefit\nplans, merely \u201credefine[d] the elements of a plaintiff\u2019s\nprima facie case,\u201d or instead \u201cestablish[ed] a defense\u201d to\nwhat \u201cotherwise would be a violation of the Act.\u201d Id., at\n181.10 Although the provision contained no \u201cotherwise\nprohibited\u201d kind of language, we said that it \u201cappears on\nfirst reading to describe an affirmative defense.\u201d Ibid. We\nnonetheless thought that this more natural view (which\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCity of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228 (2005), Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 16, n. 1 (noting that 29 CFR \u00a71625.7(d) (2007) \u201ctakes a position\nthat does not survive\u201d City of Jackson), for the regulation seems to\nrequire a showing of business necessity as a part of the RFOA defense.\nCompare 29 CFR \u00a71625.7(d) (\u201cWhen an employment practice, including\na test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment . . . on the grounds\nthat it is a \u2018factor other than\u2019 age, and such a practice has an adverse\nimpact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be\njustified as a business necessity\u201d), with City of Jackson, supra, at 243\n(\u201cUnlike the business necessity test, which asks whether there are\nother ways for the employer to achieve its goals that do not result in a\ndisparate impact on a protected class, the reasonableness inquiry\nincludes no such requirement\u201d). And the second regulation would take\na bit of stretching to cover disparate-impact cases, for its text speaks in\nterms of disparate treatment. See 29 CFR \u00a71625.7(e) (concerning use of\nthe RFOA defense against an \u201cindividual claim of discriminatory\ntreatment\u201d). The EEOC has lately proposed rulemaking that would\nrevise both of these regulations, eliminating any reference to \u201cbusiness\nnecessity\u201d and placing the burden of proof on the employer \u201c[w]henever\nthe exception of \u2018a reasonable factor other than age\u2019 is raised.\u201d 73 Fed.\nReg. 16807\u201316809 (Mar. 31, 2008) (proposed 29 CFR \u00a71625.7(e)).\n  10 The provision read: \u201cIt shall not be unlawful for an employer . . . to\n\nobserve the terms of . . . any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a\nretirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to\nevade the purposes of this chapter . . . because of the age of such indi-\nvidual.\u201d 29 U.

S., at\n181. A year later, however, Congress responded to Betts\nby enacting the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act,\nPub. L. 101\u2013433, 104 Stat. 978, avowedly to \u201crestore the\noriginal congressional intent\u201d that the ADEA\u2019s benefits\nprovision be read as an affirmative defense, id., \u00a7101.\nWhat is instructive on the question at hand is that, in\nclarifying that \u00a7623(f)(2) specifies affirmative defenses,\nCongress not only set the burden in so many words but\nalso added the phrase \u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d as a part of\nthe preface (just as in the text of \u00a7623(f)(1)).11 Congress\nthus confirmed the natural implication that we find in the\n\u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d language in \u00a7623(f)(1): it refers to\nan excuse or justification for behavior that, standing\nalone, violates the statute\u2019s prohibition. The amendment\nin the aftermath of Betts shows that Congress under-\nstands the phrase the same way we naturally read it, as a\nclear signal that a defense to what is \u201cotherwise prohib-\nited\u201d is an affirmative defense, entirely the responsibility\nof the party raising it.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Congress surely could not have meant this phrase to contradict its\n\nexpress allocation of the burden, in the same amendment. But that\nwould be the upshot of Knolls\u2019s suggestion that the only way to read the\nword \u201cotherwise\u201d as not redundant in the phrase \u201cotherwise prohibited\nunder subsection (a), (b), (c), or (e)\u201d is to say that the word must refer\nonly to \u00a7623(f)(1) itself, implying that \u00a7623(f)(1) must be a liability-\ncreating provision for which the burden falls on the plaintiff. Brief for\nRespondents 33, and n. 7. Besides, this argument proves too much, for\nit implies that even the BFOQ exemption is not an affirmative defense.\n10        MEACHAM v.

Because it bars liability where action is taken for\nreasons \u201cother than age,\u201d the argument goes, the provision\nmust be directed not at justifying age discrimination by\nproof of some extenuating fact but at negating the premise\nof liability under \u00a7623(a)(2), \u201cbecause of age.\u201d\n   The answer to this argument, however, is City of Jack-\nson, where we confirmed that the prohibition in \u00a7623(a)(2)\nextends to practices with a disparate impact, inferring this\nresult in part from the presence of the RFOA provision at\nissue here.12 We drew on the recognized distinction be-\ntween disparate-treatment and disparate-impact forms of\nliability, and explained that \u201cthe very definition of dispa-\nrate impact\u201d was that \u201can employer who classifies his\nemployees without respect to age may still be liable under\nthe terms of this paragraph if such classification adversely\naffects the employee because of that employee\u2019s age.\u201d 544\nU.

See City of Jackson, 544 U. S., at 238\u2013239 (plural-\nity opinion); id., at 252\u2013253 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment)\n(describing \u201csafe harbor\u201d view).\n                      Cite as: 554 U.

The RFOA defense in a\ndisparate-impact case, then, is not focused on the asserted\nfact that a non-age factor was at work; we assume it was.\nThe focus of the defense is that the factor relied upon was\na \u201creasonable\u201d one for the employer to be using. Reason-\nableness is a justification categorically distinct from the\nfactual condition \u201cbecause of age\u201d and not necessarily\ncorrelated with it in any particular way: a reasonable\nfactor may lean more heavily on older workers, as against\nyounger ones, and an unreasonable factor might do just\nthe opposite.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 The   factual causation that \u00a7623(a)(2) describes as practices that\n\u201cdeprive or tend to deprive . . . or otherwise adversely affect [employees]\n. . . because of . . . age\u201d is typically shown by looking to data revealing\nthe impact of a given practice on actual employees. See, e.g., City of\nJackson, 544 U. S., at 241 (opinion of the Court); cf. Wards Cove Pack-\ning Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642, 657, 658\u2013659 (1989) (under Title VII,\n\u201cspecific causation\u201d is shown, and a \u201cprima facie case\u201d is \u201cestablish[ed],\u201d\nwhen plaintiff identifies a specific employment practice linked to a\nstatistical disparity); Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S.\n977, 995 (1988) (plurality opinion) (in Title VII cases, \u201cstatistical\ndisparities must be sufficiently substantial that they raise . . . an\ninference of causation\u201d).\n    This enquiry would be muddled if the value, \u201creasonableness,\u201d were\nto become a factor artificially boosting or discounting the factual\nstrength of the causal link, or the extent of the measured impact. It\nwould open the door to incoherent undershooting, for example, if\ndefendants were heard to say that an impact is \u201csomewhat less corre-\nlated with age, seeing as the factor is a reasonable one\u201d; and it would be\n12    MEACHAM v. KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABORATORY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III\n   The Court of Appeals majority rejected the affirmative\ndefense reading and arrived at its position on the burden\nof proof question by a different route: because it read our\ndecision in City of Jackson as ruling out the so-called\n\u201cbusiness necessity\u201d enquiry in ADEA cases, the court\nconcluded that the RFOA defense \u201creplaces\u201d it and there-\nfore must conform to its burden of persuasion resting on\nthe complaining party. But the court\u2019s premise (that City\nof Jackson modified the \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d enquiry) is\nmistaken; this alone would be reason enough to reject its\napproach. And although we are now satisfied that the\nbusiness necessity test should have no place in ADEA\ndisparate-impact cases, we agree with the Government\nthat this conclusion does not stand in the way of our hold-\ning that the RFOA exemption is an affirmative defense.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25\u201327.\n   To begin with, when the Court of Appeals further in-\nferred from the City of Jackson reference to Wards Cove\nthat the Wards Cove burden of persuasion (on the em-\nployee, for the business necessity enquiry) also applied to\nthe RFOA defense, it gave short shrift to the reasons set\nout in Part II\u2013A, supra, for reading RFOA as an affirma-\ntive defense (with the burden on the employer). But we\nthink that even on its own terms, City of Jackson falls\nshort of supporting the Court of Appeals\u2019s conclusion.\n   Although City of Jackson contains the statement that\n\u201cWards Cove\u2019s pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII\u2019s identi-\ncal language remains applicable to the ADEA,\u201d 544 U. S.,\nat 240, City of Jackson made only two specific references\nto aspects of the Wards Cove interpretation of Title VII\nthat might have \u201cremain[ed] applicable\u201d in ADEA cases.\nOne was to the existence of disparate-impact liability,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\novershooting to make them show that the impact is \u201cnot correlated with\nage, and the factor is reasonable, besides.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich City of Jackson explained was narrower in ADEA\ncases than under Title VII. The other was to a plaintiff-\nemployee\u2019s burden of identifying which particular prac-\ntices allegedly cause an observed disparate impact, which\nis the employee\u2019s burden under both the ADEA and the\npre-1991 Title VII. See 544 U. S., at 241. Neither of these\nreferences, of course, is at odds with the view of RFOA as\nan affirmative defense.\n   If, indeed, City of Jackson\u2019s reference to Wards Cove\ncould be read literally to include other aspects of the latter\ncase, beyond what mattered in City of Jackson itself, the\nuntoward consequences of the broader reading would rule\nit out. One such consequence is embraced by Meacham,\nwho argues both that the Court of Appeals was wrong to\nplace the burden of persuasion for the RFOA defense on\nthe employee, and that the court was right in thinking\nthat City of Jackson adopted the Wards Cove burden of\npersuasion on what Meacham views as one element of an\nADEA impact claim. For Meacham takes the position that\nan impact plaintiff like himself has to negate business\nnecessity in order to show that the employer\u2019s actions were\n\u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d; only then does the RFOA (with the\nburden of persuasion on the employer) have a role to play.\nTo apply both tests, however, would force the parties to\ndevelop (and the court or jury to follow) two overlapping\nenquiries: first, whether the employment practice at issue\n(based on a factor other than age) is supported by a busi-\nness justification; and second, whether that factor is a\nreasonable one. Depending on how the first enquiry pro-\nceeds, a plaintiff might directly contest the force of the\nemployer\u2019s rationale, or else try to show that the employer\ninvoked it as a pretext by pointing (for example) to alter-\nnative practices with less of a disparate impact. See\nWards Cove, 490 U. S., at 658 (\u201cfirst, a consideration of the\njustifications an employer offers for his use of these prac-\ntices; and second, the availability of alternative practices\n14    MEACHAM v. KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABORATORY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto achieve the same business ends, with less racial\nimpact\u201d); see also id., at 658\u2013661. But even if the\nplaintiff succeeded at one or the other, in Meacham\u2019s\nscheme the employer could still avoid liability by proving\nreasonableness.\n   Here is what is so strange: as the Government says, \u201c[i]f\ndisparate-impact plaintiffs have already established that a\nchallenged practice is a pretext for intentional age dis-\ncrimination, it makes little sense then to ask whether the\ndiscriminatory practice is based on reasonable factors\nother than age.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n26 (emphasis in original). Conversely, proving the reason-\nableness defense would eliminate much of the point a\nplaintiff would have had for showing alternatives in the\nfirst place: why make the effort to show alternative prac-\ntices with a less discriminatory effect (and besides, how\nwould that prove pretext?), when everyone knows that the\nchoice of a practice relying on a \u201creasonable\u201d non-age\nfactor is good enough to avoid liability?14 At the very\nleast, developing the reasonableness defense would be\nsubstantially redundant with the direct contest over the\nforce of the business justification, especially when both\nenquiries deal with the same, narrowly specified practice.\nIt is not very fair to take the remark about Wards Cove in\nCity of Jackson as requiring such a wasteful and confusing\nstructure of proof.\n   Nor is there any good way to read the same line from\nCity of Jackson as implying that the burden of proving any\nbusiness-related defense falls on the plaintiff; most obvi-\nously, this would entail no longer taking the BFOQ clause\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 See City of Jackson, 544 U. S., at 243 (\u201cWhile there may have been\n\nother reasonable ways for the City to achieve its goals, the one selected\nwas not unreasonable. Unlike the business necessity test, which asks\nwhether there are other ways for the employer to achieve its goals that\ndo not result in a disparate impact on a protected class, the reasonable-\nness inquiry includes no such requirement\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

What is more,\nCity of Jackson could not have had the RFOA clause in\nmind as \u201cidentical\u201d to anything in Title VII (for which a\nWards Cove\u2019s reading might be adopted), for that statute\nhas no like-worded defense. And as Wards Cove did not\npurport to construe any statutory defenses under Title\nVII, only an over-reading of City of Jackson would find\nlurking in it an assumption that Wards Cove has anything\nto say about statutory defenses in the ADEA (never mind\none that Title VII does not have).\n                              IV\n   As mentioned, where City of Jackson did get help from\nour prior reading of Title VII was in relying on Wards\nCove to repeat that a plaintiff falls short by merely alleg-\ning a disparate impact, or \u201cpoint[ing] to a generalized\npolicy that leads to such an impact.\u201d City of Jackson, 544\nU. S., at 241. The plaintiff is obliged to do more: to \u201ciso-\nlat[e] and identif[y] the specific employment practices that\nare allegedly responsible for any observed statistical dis-\nparities.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Wards Cove, supra, at 656; em-\nphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted). The\naim of this requirement, as City of Jackson said, is to\navoid the \u201cresult [of] employers being potentially liable for\n\u2018the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical\nimbalances.\u2019 \u201d 544 U. S., at 241 (quoting Wards Cove,\nsupra, at 657; some internal quotation marks omitted).\nAnd as the outcome in that case shows, the requirement\nhas bite: one sufficient reason for rejecting the employees\u2019\nchallenge was that they \u201cha[d] done little more than point\nout that the pay plan at issue [was] relatively less gener-\nous to older workers than to younger workers,\u201d and \u201cha[d]\nnot identified any specific test, requirement, or practice\nwithin the pay plan that ha[d] an adverse impact on older\nworkers.\u201d City of Jackson, supra, at 241.\n16     MEACHAM v. KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABORATORY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Identifying a specific practice is not a trivial burden,\nand it ought to allay some of the concern raised by Knolls\u2019s\namici, who fear that recognizing an employer\u2019s burden of\npersuasion on an RFOA defense to impact claims will\nencourage strike suits or nudge plaintiffs with marginal\ncases into court, in turn inducing employers to alter busi-\nness practices in order to avoid being sued. See, e.g., Brief\nfor General Electric Co. as Amicus Curiae 18\u201331. It is also\nto the point that the only thing at stake in this case is the\ngap between production and persuasion; nobody is saying\nthat even the burden of production should be placed on the\nplaintiff. Cf. Schaffer, 546 U. S., at 56 (burden of persua-\nsion answers \u201cwhich party loses if the evidence is closely\nbalanced\u201d); id., at 58 (\u201cIn truth, however, very few cases\nwill be in evidentiary equipoise\u201d). And the more plainly\nreasonable the employer\u2019s \u201cfactor other than age\u201d is, the\nshorter the step for that employer from producing evi-\ndence raising the defense, to persuading the factfinder\nthat the defense is meritorious. It will be mainly in cases\nwhere the reasonableness of the non-age factor is obscure\nfor some reason, that the employer will have more evi-\ndence to reveal and more convincing to do in going from\nproduction to persuasion.\n   That said, there is no denying that putting employers to\nthe work of persuading factfinders that their choices are\nreasonable makes it harder and costlier to defend than if\nemployers merely bore the burden of production; nor do we\ndoubt that this will sometimes affect the way employers do\nbusiness with their employees. But at the end of the day,\namici\u2019s concerns have to be directed at Congress, which set\nthe balance where it is, by both creating the RFOA exemp-\ntion and writing it in the orthodox format of an affirmative\ndefense. We have to read it the way Congress wrote it.\n                        *    *    *\n     As we have said before, Congress took account of the\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

S., at 233. And as the out-\ncome for the employer in City of Jackson shows, \u201cit is not\nsurprising that certain employment criteria that are rou-\ntinely used may be reasonable despite their adverse im-\npact on older workers as a group.\u201d Id., at 241. In this\ncase, we realize that the Court of Appeals showed no\nhesitation in finding that Knolls prevailed on the RFOA\ndefense, though the court expressed its conclusion in\nterms of Meacham\u2019s failure to meet the burden of persua-\nsion. Whether the outcome should be any different when\nthe burden is properly placed on the employer is best left\nto that court in the first instance. The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

As represented by the Solicitor General\nof the United States in a brief signed by the Commission\u2019s\nGeneral Counsel, the Commission takes the position that\nthe reasonable-factor-other-than-age provision is an af-\nfirmative defense on which the employer bears the burden\nof proof, and that, in disparate-impact suits brought under\nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967\n(ADEA), that provision replaces the business-necessity\ntest of Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642\n(1989).\n   Neither position was contrived just for this case. In-\ndeed, the Commission has arguably held its view on the\nburden-of-proof point for nearly 30 years. See 44 Fed.\nReg. 68858, 68861 (1979). Although its regulation applied\nonly to cases involving \u201cdiscriminatory treatment,\u201d 29\nCFR \u00a71625.7(e) (2007), even if that covers only disparate\ntreatment, see ante, at 7\u20138, n. 9, the logic of its extension\nto disparate-impact claims is obvious and unavoidable.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16, n. 1. At\nthe very least, the regulation does not contradict the\n2    MEACHAM v. KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABORATORY\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCommission\u2019s current position: It does not say that the\nemployer bears the burden of proof only in discriminatory-\ntreatment cases.\n   The Commission\u2019s view on the business-necessity test is\nnewly minted, but that does not undermine it. The Com-\nmission has never expressed the contrary view that the\nfactfinder must consider both business necessity and\nreasonableness when an employer applies a factor that\nhas a disparate impact on older workers. In fact, before\nSmith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228 (2005), the Com-\nmission had not even considered the relationship between\nthe two standards, because it used to treat the two as\nidentical. See 29 CFR \u00a71625.7(d). After City of Jackson\nrejected that equation, see 544 U. S., at 243, the Commis-\nsion decided that the business-necessity standard plays no\nrole in ADEA disparate-impact claims, see Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 25\u201327, and has even\nproposed new rules setting forth that position, see 73 Fed.\nReg. 16807\u201316809 (2008).\n   Because administration of the ADEA has been placed in\nthe hands of the Commission, and because the agency\u2019s\npositions on the questions before us are unquestionably\nreasonable (as the Court\u2019s opinion ably shows), I defer to\nthe agency\u2019s views.

(Knolls), the operator of the Government's Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, which has a history dating back to the first nuclear-powered submarines in the 1940s and 1950s. The United States Navy and the Department of Energy jointly fund Knolls's operations, decide what projects it should pursue, and set its annual staffing limits. In recent years, Knolls has been charged with designing prototype naval nuclear reactors and with training Navy personnel to run them.</p>\n<p>The demands for naval nuclear reactors changed with the end of the Cold War, and for fiscal year 1996 Knolls was ordered to reduce its work force. Even after a hundred or so employees chose to take the company's ensuing buyout offer, Knolls was left with thirty-some jobs to cut.<sup>[1]</sup> Petitioners (Meacham, for short) are among those laid off in the resulting \"involuntary reduction in force.\" In order to select those for layoff, Knolls told its managers to score their subordinates on three scales, \"performance,\" \"flexibility,\" and \"critical skills.\"<sup>[2]</sup> The scores were summed, along with points for years of service, and the totals determined who should be let go.</p>\n<p>Of the 31 salaried employees laid off, 30 were at least 40 years old.<sup>[3]</sup> Twenty-eight of them sued, raising both disparate-treatment (discriminatory intent) and disparate-impact (discriminatory result) claims under the ADEA and state law, alleging that Knolls \"designed and implemented its workforce reduction process to eliminate older employees and that, regardless of intent, the process had a discriminatory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2399</span> impact on ADEA-protected employees.\" <i>Meacham v.

Both exempt otherwise illegal conduct by reference to a further item of proof, thereby creating a defense for which the burden of persuasion falls on the \"one who claims its benefits,\" <i>Morton Salt Co., supra,</i> at 44-45, 68 S.Ct. 822, the \"party seeking relief,\" <i>Schaffer, supra,</i> at 57-58, 126 S.Ct. 528, and here, \"the employer,\" <i>Corning Glass Works, supra,</i> at 196, 94 S.Ct. 2223.</p>\n<p>If there were any doubt, the stress of the idiom \"otherwise prohibited,\" prefacing the BFOQ and RFOA conditions, would dispel it.<sup>[9]</sup> The implication of affirmative defense is underscored by contrasting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2402</span> \u00a7 623(f)(1) with the section of the ADEA at issue in <i>Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112321\"><a href=\"/opinion/112321/public-employees-retirement-system-of-ohio-v-betts/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2854, 106 L.Ed.2d 134 (1989), and by the way Congress responded to our decision there. In <i>Betts,</i> we said the issue was whether a provision in a former version of \u00a7 623(f)(2), one about employee benefit plans, merely \"redefine[d] the elements of a plaintiff's prima facie case,\" or instead \"establish[ed] a defense\" to what \"otherwise would be a violation of the Act.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 181, 109 S.Ct. 2854.<sup>[10]</sup> Although the provision contained no \"otherwise prohibited\" kind of language, we said that it \"appears on first reading to describe an affirmative defense.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We nonetheless thought that this more natural view (which we had taken in <i>Thurston</i>) was overridden by evidence of legislative history, by the peculiarity of a pretext-revealing condition in the phrasing of the provision (that a benefit plan \"not [be] a subterfuge to evade the purposes\" of the ADEA), and by the parallel with a prior case construing an \"analogous provision of Title VII\" (analogous because it also contained a pretext-revealing condition). 492 U.S., at 181, 109 S.Ct. 2854. A year later, however, Congress responded to <i>Betts</i> by enacting the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Pub.L. 101-433, 104 Stat. 978, avowedly to \"restore the original congressional intent\" that the ADEA's benefits provision be read as an affirmative defense, <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 101. What is instructive on the question at hand is that, in clarifying that \u00a7 623(f)(2) specifies affirmative defenses, Congress not only set the burden in so many words but also added the phrase \"otherwise prohibited\" as a part of the preface (just as in the text of \u00a7 623(f)(1)).<sup>[11]</sup> Congress thus confirmed the natural implication that we find in the \"otherwise prohibited\" language in \u00a7 623(f)(1): it refers to an excuse or justification for behavior that, standing alone, violates the statute's prohibition. The amendment in the aftermath of <i>Betts</i> shows that Congress understands the phrase the same way we naturally read it, as a clear signal that a defense to what is \"otherwise prohibited\" is an affirmative defense, entirely the responsibility of the party raising it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Knolls ventures that, regardless, the RFOA provision should be read as mere <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2403</span> elaboration on an element of liability. Because it bars liability where action is taken for reasons \"other than age,\" the argument goes, the provision must be directed not at justifying age discrimination by proof of some extenuating fact but at negating the premise of liability under \u00a7 623(a)(2), \"because of age.\"</p>\n<p>The answer to this argument, however, is <i>City of Jackson,</i> where we confirmed that the prohibition in \u00a7 623(a)(2) extends to practices with a disparate impact, inferring this result in part from the presence of the RFOA provision at issue here.<sup>[12]</sup> We drew on the recognized distinction between disparate-treatment and disparate-impact forms of liability, and explained that \"the very definition of disparate impact\" was that \"an employer who classifies his employees without respect to age may still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classification adversely affects the employee because of that employee's age.\" 544 U.S., at 236, n. 6, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 243, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (expressing agreement with \"all of the Court's reasoning\" in the plurality opinion, but finding it a basis for deference to the EEOC rather than for independent judicial decision). We emphasized that these were the kinds of employer activities, \"otherwise prohibited\" by \u00a7 623(a)(2), that were mainly what the statute meant to test against the RFOA condition: because \"[i]n disparate-impact cases . . . the allegedly `otherwise prohibited' activity is not based on age,\" it is \"in cases involving disparate-impact claims that the RFOA provision plays its principal role by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factor that was `reasonable.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 239, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>Thus, in <i>City of Jackson,</i> we made it clear that in the typical disparate-impact case, the employer's practice is \"without respect to age\" and its adverse impact (though \"because of age\") is \"attributable to a nonage factor\"; so action based on a \"factor other than age\" is the very premise for disparate-impact liability in the first place, not a negation of it or a defense to it. The RFOA defense in a disparate-impact case, then, is not focused on the asserted fact that a non-age factor was at work; we assume it was. The focus of the defense is that the factor relied upon was a \"reasonable\" one for the employer to be using. Reasonableness is a justification categorically distinct from the factual condition \"because of age\" and not necessarily correlated with it in any particular way: a reasonable factor may lean more heavily on older workers, as against younger ones, and an unreasonable factor might do just the opposite.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2404</span> III</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals majority rejected the affirmative defense reading and arrived at its position on the burden of proof question by a different route: because it read our decision in <i>City of Jackson</i> as ruling out the so-called \"business necessity\" enquiry in ADEA cases, the court concluded that the RFOA defense \"replaces\" it and therefore must conform to its burden of persuasion resting on the complaining party. But the court's premise (that <i>City of Jackson</i> modified the \"business necessity\" enquiry) is mistaken; this alone would be reason enough to reject its approach. And although we are now satisfied that the business necessity test should have no place in ADEA disparate-impact cases, we agree with the Government that this conclusion does not stand in the way of our holding that the RFOA exemption is an affirmative defense. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 25-27.</p>\n<p>To begin with, when the Court of Appeals further inferred from the <i>City of Jackson</i> reference to <i>Wards Cove</i> that the <i>Wards Cove</i> burden of persuasion (on the employee, for the business necessity enquiry) also applied to the RFOA defense, it gave short shrift to the reasons set out in Part II-A, <i>supra,</i> for reading RFOA as an affirmative defense (with the burden on the employer). But we think that even on its own terms, <i>City of Jackson</i> falls short of supporting the Court of Appeals's conclusion.</p>\n<p>Although <i>City of Jackson</i> contains the statement that \"<i>Wards Cove</i>'s pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII's identical language remains applicable to the ADEA,\" 544 U.S., at 240, 125 S.Ct. 1536, <i>City of Jackson</i> made only two specific references to aspects of the <i>Wards Cove</i> interpretation of Title VII that might have \"remain[ed] applicable\" in ADEA cases. One was to the existence of disparate-impact liability, which <i>City of Jackson</i> explained was narrower in ADEA cases than under Title VII. The other was to a plaintiff-employee's burden of identifying which particular practices allegedly cause an observed disparate impact, which is the employee's burden under both the ADEA and the pre-1991 Title VII. See 544 U.S., at 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536. Neither of these references, of course, is at odds with the view of RFOA as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>If, indeed, <i>City of Jackson</i>'s reference to <i>Wards Cove</i> could be read literally to include other aspects of the latter case, beyond what mattered in <i>City of Jackson</i> itself, the untoward consequences of the broader reading would rule it out. One such consequence is embraced by Meacham, who argues both that the Court of Appeals was wrong to place the burden of persuasion for the RFOA defense on the employee, and that the court was right in thinking that <i>City of Jackson</i> adopted the <i>Wards Cove</i> burden of persuasion on what Meacham views as one element of an ADEA impact claim. For Meacham takes the position that an impact plaintiff like himself has to negate business necessity in order to show that the employer's actions were \"otherwise prohibited\"; only then does the RFOA (with the burden of persuasion on the employer) have a role to play. To apply both tests, however, would force the parties to develop (and the court or jury to follow) two overlapping enquiries: first, whether the employment practice at issue (based on a factor other than <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2405</span> age) is supported by a business justification; and second, whether that factor is a reasonable one. Depending on how the first enquiry proceeds, a plaintiff might directly contest the force of the employer's rationale, or else try to show that the employer invoked it as a pretext by pointing (for example) to alternative practices with less of a disparate impact. See <i>Wards Cove,</i> 490 U.S., at 658, 109 S.Ct. 2115 (\"first, a consideration of the justifications an employer offers for his use of these practices; and second, the availability of alternative practices to achieve the same business ends, with less racial impact\"); see also <i>id.,</i> at 658-661, 109 S.Ct. 2115. But even if the plaintiff succeeded at one or the other, in Meacham's scheme the employer could still avoid liability by proving reasonableness.</p>\n<p>Here is what is so strange: as the Government says, \"[i]f disparate-impact plaintiffs have already established that a challenged practice is a pretext for intentional age discrimination, it makes little sense then to ask whether the discriminatory practice is based on reasonable factors <i>other than age.</i>\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 26 (emphasis in original). Conversely, proving the reasonableness defense would eliminate much of the point a plaintiff would have had for showing alternatives in the first place: why make the effort to show alternative practices with a less discriminatory effect (and besides, how would that prove pretext?), when everyone knows that the choice of a practice relying on a \"reasonable\" non-age factor is good enough to avoid liability?<sup>[14]</sup> At the very least, developing the reasonableness defense would be substantially redundant with the direct contest over the force of the business justification, especially when both enquiries deal with the same, narrowly specified practice. It is not very fair to take the remark about <i>Wards Cove</i> in <i>City of Jackson</i> as requiring such a wasteful and confusing structure of proof.</p>\n<p>Nor is there any good way to read the same line from <i>City of Jackson</i> as implying that the burden of proving any business-related defense falls on the plaintiff; most obviously, this would entail no longer taking the BFOQ clause to be an affirmative defense, which <i>City of Jackson</i> confirmed that it is, see 544 U.S., at 233, n. 3, 125 S.Ct. 1536. What is more, <i>City of Jackson</i> could not have had the RFOA clause in mind as \"identical\" to anything in Title VII (for which a <i>Wards Cove</i>'s reading might be adopted), for that statute has no like-worded defense. And as <i>Wards Cove</i> did not purport to construe any statutory defenses under Title VII, only an over-reading of <i>City of Jackson</i> would find lurking in it an assumption that <i>Wards Cove</i> has anything to say about statutory defenses in the ADEA (never mind one that Title VII does not have).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>As mentioned, where <i>City of Jackson</i> did get help from our prior reading of Title VII was in relying on <i>Wards Cove</i> to repeat that a plaintiff falls short by merely alleging a disparate impact, or \"point[ing] to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact.\" <i>City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S., at 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536. The plaintiff is obliged to do more: to \"isolat[e] and identif[y] the <i>specific</i> employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2406</span> <i>Wards Cove, supra,</i> at 656, 109 S.Ct. 2115; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted). The aim of this requirement, as <i>City of Jackson</i> said, is to avoid the \"result [of] employers being potentially liable for `the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances.'\" 544 U.S., at 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (quoting <i>Wards Cove, supra,</i> at 657, 109 S.Ct. 2115; some internal quotation marks omitted). And as the outcome in that case shows, the requirement has bite: one sufficient reason for rejecting the employees' challenge was that they \"ha[d] done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue [was] relatively less generous to older workers than to younger workers,\" and \"ha[d] not identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that ha[d] an adverse impact on older workers.\" <i>City of Jackson, supra,</i> at 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536.</p>\n<p>Identifying a specific practice is not a trivial burden, and it ought to allay some of the concern raised by Knolls's <i>amici,</i> who fear that recognizing an employer's burden of persuasion on an RFOA defense to impact claims will encourage strike suits or nudge plaintiffs with marginal cases into court, in turn inducing employers to alter business practices in order to avoid being sued. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for General Electric Co. as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 18-31. It is also to the point that the only thing at stake in this case is the gap between production and persuasion; nobody is saying that even the burden of production should be placed on the plaintiff. Cf. <i>Schaffer,</i> 546 U.S., at 56, 126 S.Ct. 528 (burden of persuasion answers \"which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced\"); <i>id.,</i> at 58, 126 S.Ct. 528 (\"In truth, however, very few cases will be in evidentiary equipoise\"). And the more plainly reasonable the employer's \"factor other than age\" is, the shorter the step for that employer from producing evidence raising the defense, to persuading the factfinder that the defense is meritorious. It will be mainly in cases where the reasonableness of the non-age factor is obscure for some reason, that the employer will have more evidence to reveal and more convincing to do in going from production to persuasion.</p>\n<p>That said, there is no denying that putting employers to the work of persuading factfinders that their choices are reasonable makes it harder and costlier to defend than if employers merely bore the burden of production; nor do we doubt that this will sometimes affect the way employers do business with their employees. But at the end of the day, <i>amici</i>'s concerns have to be directed at Congress, which set the balance where it is, by both creating the RFOA exemption and writing it in the orthodox format of an affirmative defense. We have to read it the way Congress wrote it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>As we have said before, Congress took account of the distinctive nature of age discrimination, and the need to preserve a fair degree of leeway for employment decisions with effects that correlate with age, when it put the RFOA clause into the ADEA, \"significantly narrow[ing] its coverage.\" <i>City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S., at 233, 125 S.Ct. 1536. And as the outcome for the employer in <i>City of Jackson</i> shows, \"it is not surprising that certain employment criteria that are routinely used may be reasonable despite their adverse impact on older workers as a group.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536. In this case, we realize that the Court of Appeals showed no hesitation in finding that Knolls prevailed on the RFOA defense, though the court expressed its conclusion in terms of Meacham's failure to meet the burden of persuasion. Whether the outcome should be any different when the burden is properly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2407</span> placed on the employer is best left to that court in the first instance. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice BREYER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I do not join the majority opinion because the Court answers for itself two questions that Congress has left to the sound judgment of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. As represented by the Solicitor General of the United States in a brief signed by the Commission's General Counsel, the Commission takes the position that the reasonable-factor-other-than-age provision is an affirmative defense on which the employer bears the burden of proof, and that, in disparate-impact suits brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), that provision replaces the business-necessity test of <i>Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112270\"><a href=\"/opinion/112270/wards-cove-packing-co-v-atonio/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989).</p>\n<p>Neither position was contrived just for this case. Indeed, the Commission has arguably held its view on the burden-of-proof point for nearly 30 years. See 44 Fed.Reg. 68858, 68861 (1979). Although its regulation applied only to cases involving \"discriminatory treatment,\" 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(e) (2007), even if that covers only disparate treatment, see <i>ante,</i> at 2401-2402, n. 9, the logic of its extension to disparate-impact claims is obvious and unavoidable. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16, n. 1. At the very least, the regulation does not contradict the Commission's current position: It does not say that the employer bears the burden of proof <i>only</i> in discriminatory-treatment cases.</p>\n<p>The Commission's view on the business-necessity test is newly minted, but that does not undermine it. The Commission has never expressed the contrary view that the factfinder must consider both business necessity <i>and</i> reasonableness when an employer applies a factor that has a disparate impact on older workers. In fact, before <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005), the Commission had not even considered the relationship between the two standards, because it used to treat the two as <i>identical.</i> See 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(d). After <i>City of Jackson</i> rejected that equation, see 544 U.S., at 243, 125 S.Ct. 1536, the Commission decided that the business-necessity standard plays no role in ADEA disparate-impact claims, see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 25-27, and has even proposed new rules setting forth that position, see 73 Fed.Reg. 16807-16809 (2008).</p>\n<p>Because administration of the ADEA has been placed in the hands of the Commission, and because the agency's positions on the questions before us are unquestionably reasonable (as the Court's opinion ably shows), I defer to the agency's views. See <i>Raymond B. Yates, M. D., P.C. Profit Sharing Plan v. Hendon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134722\"><a href=\"/opinion/134722/raymond-b-yates-md-pc-profit-sharing-plan-v-hendon/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 24-25, 124 S.Ct. 1330, 158 L.Ed.2d 40 (2004) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). I therefore concur in the Court's judgment to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I write separately to note that I continue to believe that disparate-impact claims are not cognizable under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <i>et seq.</i> See <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 247-268, 125 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2408</span> 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005) (O'Connor, J., joined by KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ., concurring in judgment). Moreover, I disagree with the Court's statement that the \"reasonable factors other than age\" (RFOA) exception, \u00a7 623(f)(1), is principally relevant in disparate-impact cases. Compare <i>City of Jackson, supra,</i> at 251-253, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (opinion concurring in judgment), with <i>ante,</i> at 2402-2403 (citing <i>City of Jackson, supra,</i> at 239, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (plurality opinion)). I therefore join only Parts I and II-A of the Court's opinion because I agree that the RFOA exception is an affirmative defense\u0097when it arises in disparate-treatment cases. Here, although the Court of Appeals erred in placing the burden of proof on petitioners, I would nonetheless affirm because the only claims at issue are disparate-impact claims.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Naval Reactors program had lowered Knolls's staffing limit by 108 people; as Knolls also had to hire 35 new employees for work existing personnel could not do, a total of 143 jobs would have to go.</p>\n<p>[2]  The \"performance\" score was based on the worker's two most recent appraisals. The \"flexibility\" instruction read: \"Rate the employee's flexibility within the Laboratory. Can his or her documented skills be used in other assignments that will add value to current or future Lab work? Is the employee retrainable for other Lab assignments?\" The \"critical skills\" instruction read: \"How critical are the employee's skills to continuing work in the Lab? Is the individual's skill a <i>key</i> technical resource for the [Naval Reactors] program? Is the skill readily accessible within the Lab or generally available from the external market?\" App. 94-95 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>[3]  For comparison: after the voluntary buyouts, 1,203 out of 2,063 salaried workers (or 58%) were at least 40 years old; and of the 245 who were at risk of involuntary layoff, and therefore included in the rankings scheme, 179 (or 73%) were 40 or over. <i>Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory,</i> 185 F.Supp.2d 193, 203 (N.D.N.Y.2002).</p>\n<p>[4]  The expert cut the data in different ways, showing the chances to be 1 in 348,000 (based on a population of all 2,063 salaried workers); 1 in 1,260 (based on a population of the 245 workers at risk of layoff); or 1 in 6,639 (when the analysis was broken down by sections of the company). <i>Meacham I,</i> 381 F.3d, at 64-65.</p>\n<p>[5]  Taking the <i>Wards Cove</i> steps in turn, the Court of Appeals concluded that the \"jury could have found that the degree of subjective decision making allowed in the [layoff procedure] created the disparity,\" 381 F.3d, at 74; that the employer had answered with evidence of a \"facially legitimate business justification,\" a need \"to reduce its workforce while still retaining employees with skills critical to the performance of [Knolls's] functions,\" <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted); and that petitioners would prevail nonetheless because \"[a]t least one suitable alternative is clear from the record,\" that Knolls \"could have designed [a procedure] with more safeguards against subjectivity, in particular, tests for criticality and flexibility that are less vulnerable to managerial bias,\" <i>id.,</i> at 75.</p>\n<p>[6]  Distinguishing the two tests mattered, the Court of Appeals explained, because even though \"[t]here may have been other reasonable ways for [Knolls] to achieve its goals (as we held in <i>[Meacham I]</i>), . . . the one selected was not unreasonable.\" <i>Meacham II,</i> 461 F.3d, at 146 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The burden of persuasion for either test was said to fall on the plaintiff, however, because \"the employer is not to bear the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to the legitimacy of its business justification.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 142 (citing <i>Wards Cove,</i> 490 U.S., at 659-660, 109 S.Ct. 2115; internal quotation marks omitted). The majority took note of the textual signs that the RFOA was an affirmative defense, but set them aside because \"<i>City of Jackson</i> . . . emphasized that there are reasonable and permissible employment criteria that correlate with age,\" thereby leaving it to plaintiffs to prove that a criterion is not reasonable. 461 F.3d, at 142-143.</p>\n<p>[7]  In Judge Pooler's view, a jury \"could permissibly find that defendants had not established a RFOA based on the unmonitored subjectivity of [Knolls's] plan as implemented.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 153 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>[8]  Petitioners also sought certiorari as to \"[w]hether respondents' practice of conferring broad discretionary authority upon individual managers to decide which employees to lay off during a reduction in force constituted a `reasonable factor other than age' as a matter of law.\" Pet. for Cert. i. We denied certiorari on this question and express no views on it here.</p>\n<p>[9]  We do not need to seek further relief from doubt by looking to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations on burdens of proof in ADEA cases. The parties focus on two of them, but we think neither clearly answers the question here. One of them the Government has disavowed as overtaken by our decision in <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005), Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16, n. 1 (noting that 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(d) (2007) \"takes a position that does not survive\" <i>City of Jackson</i>), for the regulation seems to require a showing of business necessity as a part of the RFOA defense. Compare 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(d) (\"When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment . . . on the grounds that it is a `factor other than' age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity\"), with <i>City of Jackson, supra,</i> at 243, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (\"Unlike the business necessity test, which asks whether there are other ways for the employer to achieve its goals that do not result in a disparate impact on a protected class, the reasonableness inquiry includes no such requirement\"). And the second regulation would take a bit of stretching to cover disparate-impact cases, for its text speaks in terms of disparate treatment. See 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(e) (concerning use of the RFOA defense against an \"individual claim of discriminatory treatment\"). The EEOC has lately proposed rulemaking that would revise both of these regulations, eliminating any reference to \"business necessity\" and placing the burden of proof on the employer \"[w]henever the exception of `a reasonable factor other than age' is raised.\" 73 Fed.Reg. 16807-16809 (Mar. 31, 2008) (proposed 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(e)).</p>\n<p>[10]  The provision read: \"It shall not be unlawful for an employer . . . to observe the terms of . . . any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter . . . because of the age of such individual.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(2) (1982 ed.).</p>\n<p>[11]  Congress surely could not have meant this phrase to contradict its express allocation of the burden, in the same amendment. But that would be the upshot of Knolls's suggestion that the only way to read the word \"otherwise\" as not redundant in the phrase \"otherwise prohibited under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (e)\" is to say that the word must refer only to \u00a7 623(f)(1) itself, implying that \u00a7 623(f)(1) must be a liability-creating provision for which the burden falls on the plaintiff. Brief for Respondents 33, and n. 7. Besides, this argument proves too much, for it implies that even the BFOQ exemption is not an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>[12]  In doing so, we expressly rejected the so-called \"safe harbor\" view of the RFOA provision. See <i>City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S., at 238-239, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 252-253, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (describing \"safe harbor\" view).</p>\n<p>[13]  The factual causation that \u00a7 623(a)(2) describes as practices that \"deprive or tend to deprive . . . or otherwise adversely affect [employees]. . . because of . . . age\" is typically shown by looking to data revealing the impact of a given practice on actual employees. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S., at 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (opinion of the Court); cf. <i>Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112270\"><a href=\"/opinion/112270/wards-cove-packing-co-v-atonio/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span>, 657, 658-659, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989) (under Title VII, \"specific causation\" is shown, and a \"prima facie case\" is \"establish[ed],\" when plaintiff identifies a specific employment practice linked to a statistical disparity); <i>Watson v.

It would open the door to incoherent undershooting, for example, if defendants were heard to say that an impact is \"somewhat less correlated with age, seeing as the factor is a reasonable one\"; and it would be overshooting to make them show that the impact is \"not correlated with age, and the factor is reasonable, besides.\"</p>\n<p>[14]  See <i>City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S., at 243, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (\"While there may have been other reasonable ways for the City to achieve its goals, the one selected was not unreasonable.
