Argued March 19, 2008\u2014Decided June 19, 2008\nOrganizations whose members do business with California sued to en-\n  join enforcement of \u201cAssembly Bill 1889\u201d (AB 1889), which, among\n  other things, prohibits employers that receive state grants or more\n  than $10,000 in state program funds per year from using the funds\n  \u201cto assist, promote, or deter union organizing.\u201d Cal. Govt. Code Ann.\n  \u00a7\u00a716645.2(a), 16645.7(a). The District Court granted the plaintiffs\n  partial summary judgment, holding that the National Labor Rela-\n  tions Act (NLRA) pre-empts \u00a7\u00a716645.2 and 16645.7 because they\n  regulate employer speech about union organizing under circum-\n  stances in which Congress intended free debate. The Ninth Circuit\n  reversed, concluding that Congress did not intend to preclude States\n  from imposing such restrictions on the use of their own funds.\nHeld: Sections 16645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-empted by the NLRA.\n Pp. 4\u201316.\n    (a) The NLRA contains no express pre-emption provision, but this\n Court has held pre-emption necessary to implement federal labor pol-\n icy where, inter alia, Congress intended particular conduct to \u201cbe un-\n regulated because left \u2018to be controlled by the free play of economic\n forces.\u2019 \u201d Machinists v.

Pp. 4\u20135.\n    (b) Sections 16645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-empted under Machinists\n because they regulate within \u201ca zone protected and reserved for mar-\n ket freedom.\u201d Building & Constr. Trades Council v. Associated\n Builders & Contractors of Mass./R. I., Inc., 507 U. S. 218, 227. In\n 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act amended the NLRA by, among other\n2           CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                          v. BROWN\n                           Syllabus\n\n    things, adding \u00a78(c), which protects from National Labor Relations\n    Board (NLRB) regulation noncoercive speech by both unions and em-\n    ployers about labor organizing. The section both responded to prior\n    NLRB rulings that employers\u2019 attempts to persuade employees not to\n    organize amounted to coercion prohibited as an unfair labor practice\n    by the previous version of \u00a78 and manifested a \u201ccongressional intent\n    to encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and management.\u201d\n    Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 62. Congress\u2019 express\n    protection of free debate forcefully buttresses the pre-emption analy-\n    sis in this case. California\u2019s policy judgment that partisan employer\n    speech necessarily interferes with an employee\u2019s choice about union\n    representation is the same policy judgment that Congress renounced\n    when it amended the NLRA to preclude regulation of noncoercive\n    speech as an unfair labor practice. To the extent \u00a7\u00a716645.2 and\n    16645.7 actually further AB 1889\u2019s express goal, they are unequivo-\n    cally pre-empted.

EDMUND G.\n      BROWN, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL OF\n              CALIFORNIA, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                                [June 19, 2008]\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A California statute known as \u201cAssembly Bill 1889\u201d (AB\n1889) prohibits several classes of employers that receive\nstate funds from using the funds \u201cto assist, promote, or\ndeter union organizing.\u201d       See Cal. Govt. Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a716645\u201316649 (West Supp. 2008). The question pre-\nsented to us is whether two of its provisions\u2014\u00a716645.2,\napplicable to grant recipients, and \u00a716645.7, applicable to\nprivate employers receiving more than $10,000 in program\nfunds in any year\u2014are pre-empted by federal law mandat-\ning that certain zones of labor activity be unregulated.\n                             I\n  As set forth in the preamble, the State of California\nenacted AB 1889 for the following purpose:\n    \u201cIt is the policy of the state not to interfere with an\n    employee\u2019s choice about whether to join or to be repre-\n    sented by a labor union. For this reason, the state\n    should not subsidize efforts by an employer to assist,\n    promote, or deter union organizing. It is the intent of\n    the Legislature in enacting this act to prohibit an em-\n2       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n    ployer from using state funds and facilities for the\n    purpose of influencing employees to support or oppose\n    unionization and to prohibit an employer from seeking\n    to influence employees to support or oppose unioniza-\n    tion while those employees are performing work on a\n    state contract.\u201d 2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, \u00a71.\n   AB 1889 forbids certain employers that receive state\nfunds\u2014whether by reimbursement, grant, contract, use of\nstate property, or pursuant to a state program\u2014from\nusing such funds to \u201cassist, promote, or deter union orga-\nnizing.\u201d See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a716645.1 to 16645.7.\nThis prohibition encompasses \u201cany attempt by an em-\nployer to influence the decision of its employees\u201d regarding\n\u201c[w]hether to support or oppose a labor organization\u201d and\n\u201c[w]hether to become a member of any labor organization.\u201d\n\u00a716645(a). The statute specifies that the spending restric-\ntion applies to \u201cany expense, including legal and consult-\ning fees and salaries of supervisors and employees, in-\ncurred for . . . an activity to assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing.\u201d \u00a716646(a).\n   Despite the neutral statement of policy quoted above,\nAB 1889 expressly exempts \u201cactivit[ies] performed\u201d or\n\u201cexpense[s] incurred\u201d in connection with certain undertak-\nings that promote unionization, including \u201c[a]llowing a\nlabor organization or its representatives access to the\nemployer\u2019s facilities or property,\u201d and \u201c[n]egotiating, enter-\ning into, or carrying out a voluntary recognition agree-\nment with a labor organization.\u201d \u00a7\u00a716647(b), (d).\n   To ensure compliance with the grant and program re-\nstrictions at issue in this case, AB 1889 establishes a\nformidable enforcement scheme. Covered employers must\ncertify that no state funds will be used for prohibited\nexpenditures; the employer must also maintain and pro-\nvide upon request \u201crecords sufficient to show that no state\nfunds were used for those expenditures.\u201d \u00a7\u00a716645.2(c),\n                   Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n16645.7(b)\u2013(c). If an employer commingles state and other\nfunds, the statute presumes that any expenditures to\nassist, promote, or deter union organizing derive in part\nfrom state funds on a pro rata basis. \u00a716646(b). Violators\nare liable to the State for the amount of funds used for\nprohibited purposes plus a civil penalty equal to twice the\namount of those funds. \u00a7\u00a716645.2(d), 16645.7(d). Sus-\npected violators may be sued by the state attorney general\nor any private taxpayer, and prevailing plaintiffs are\n\u201centitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d\n\u00a716645.8(d).\n                               II\n  In April 2002, several organizations whose members do\nbusiness with the State of California (collectively, Cham-\nber of Commerce), brought this action against the Califor-\nnia Department of Health Services and appropriate state\nofficials (collectively, the State) to enjoin enforcement of\nAB 1889. Two labor unions (collectively, AFL\u2013CIO) inter-\nvened to defend the statute\u2019s validity.\n  The District Court granted partial summary judgment\nin favor of the Chamber of Commerce,1 holding that the\nNational Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, as\namended, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7151 et seq. pre-empts Cal. Govt.\nCode Ann. \u00a716645.2 (concerning grants) and \u00a716645.7\n(concerning program funds) because those provisions\n\u201cregulat[e] employer speech about union organizing under\nspecified circumstances, even though Congress intended\nfree debate.\u201d Chamber of Commerce v. Lockyer, 225\nF. Supp. 2d 1199, 1205 (CD Cal. 2002). The Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, after twice affirming the\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment, granted rehearing en banc and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The District Court held that the Chamber of Commerce lacked\nstanding to challenge several provisions of AB 1889 concerning state\ncontractors and public employers. See Chamber of Commerce v.\nLockyer, 225 F. Supp. 2d 1199, 1202\u20131203 (CD Cal. 2002).\n4       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nreversed. See Chamber of Commerce v. Lockyer, 463 F. 3d\n1076, 1082 (2006). While the en banc majority agreed that\nCalifornia enacted \u00a7\u00a716645.2 and 16645.7 in its capacity\nas a regulator, and not as a mere proprietor or market\nparticipant, see id., at 1082\u20131085, it concluded that Con-\ngress did not intend to preclude States from imposing such\nrestrictions on the use of their own funds, see id., at 1085\u2013\n1096. We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), and\nnow reverse.\n   Although the NLRA itself contains no express pre-\nemption provision, we have held that Congress implicitly\nmandated two types of pre-emption as necessary to im-\nplement federal labor policy. The first, known as Garmon\npre-emption, see San Diego Building Trades Council v.\nGarmon, 359 U. S. 236 (1959), \u201cis intended to preclude\nstate interference with the National Labor Relations\nBoard\u2019s interpretation and active enforcement of the \u2018inte-\ngrated scheme of regulation\u2019 established by the NLRA.\u201d\nGolden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 475 U. S. 608,\n613 (1986) (Golden State I). To this end, Garmon pre-\nemption forbids States to \u201cregulate activity that the NLRA\nprotects, prohibits, or arguably protects or prohibits.\u201d\nWisconsin Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282,\n286 (1986).      The second, known as Machinists pre-\nemption, forbids both the National Labor Relations Board\n(NLRB) and States to regulate conduct that Congress\nintended \u201cbe unregulated because left \u2018to be controlled by\nthe free play of economic forces.\u2019 \u201d Machinists v. Wisconsin\nEmployment Relations Comm\u2019n, 427 U. S. 132, 140 (1976)\n(quoting NLRB v. Nash-Finch Co., 404 U. S. 138, 144\n(1971)). Machinists pre-emption is based on the premise\nthat \u201c \u2018Congress struck a balance of protection, prohibition,\nand laissez-faire in respect to union organization, collec-\ntive bargaining, and labor disputes.\u2019 \u201d 427 U. S., at 140,\nn. 4 (quoting Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85\nHarv. L. Rev. 1337, 1352 (1972)).\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Today we hold that \u00a7\u00a716645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-\nempted under Machinists because they regulate within \u201ca\nzone protected and reserved for market freedom.\u201d Build-\ning & Constr. Trades Council v. Associated Builders &\nContractors of Mass./R. I., Inc., 507 U. S. 218, 227 (1993)\n(Boston Harbor). We do not reach the question whether\nthe provisions would also be pre-empted under Garmon.\n                              III\n   As enacted in 1935, the NLRA, which was commonly\nknown as the Wagner Act, did not include any provision\nthat specifically addressed the intersection between em-\nployee organizational rights and employer speech rights.\nSee 49 Stat. 449. Rather, it was left to the NLRB, subject\nto review in federal court, to reconcile these interests in its\nconstruction of \u00a7\u00a77 and 8. Section 7, now codified at 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7157, provided that workers have the right to\norganize, to bargain collectively, and to engage in con-\ncerted activity for their mutual aid and protection. Sec-\ntion 8(1), now codified at 29 U. S. C. \u00a7158(a)(1), made it an\n\u201cunfair labor practice\u201d for employers to \u201cinterfere with,\nrestrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights\nguaranteed by section 7.\u201d\n   Among the frequently litigated issues under the Wagner\nAct were charges that an employer\u2019s attempts to persuade\nemployees not to join a union\u2014or to join one favored by\nthe employer rather than a rival\u2014amounted to a form of\ncoercion prohibited by \u00a78. The NLRB took the position\nthat \u00a78 demanded complete employer neutrality during\norganizing campaigns, reasoning that any partisan em-\nployer speech about unions would interfere with the \u00a77\nrights of employees. See 1 J. Higgins, The Developing\nLabor Law 94 (5th ed. 2006). In 1941, this Court curtailed\nthe NLRB\u2019s aggressive interpretation, clarifying that\nnothing in the NLRA prohibits an employer \u201cfrom express-\ning its view on labor policies or problems\u201d unless the em-\n6      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nployer\u2019s speech \u201cin connection with other circumstances\n[amounts] to coercion within the meaning of the Act.\u201d\nNLRB v. Virginia Elec. & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469, 477\n(1941). We subsequently characterized Virginia Electric\nas recognizing the First Amendment right of employers to\nengage in noncoercive speech about unionization. Thomas\nv. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 537\u2013538 (1945). Notwithstand-\ning these decisions, the NLRB continued to regulate em-\nployer speech too restrictively in the eyes of Congress.\n  Concerned that the Wagner Act had pushed the labor\nrelations balance too far in favor of unions, Congress\npassed the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Taft-\nHartley Act). 61 Stat. 136. The Taft-Hartley Act amended\n\u00a7\u00a77 and 8 in several key respects. First, it emphasized\nthat employees \u201chave the right to refrain from any or all\u201d\n\u00a77 activities. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7157. Second, it added \u00a78(b),\nwhich prohibits unfair labor practices by unions. 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7158(b). Third, it added \u00a78(c), which protects\nspeech by both unions and employers from regulation\nby the NLRB. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7158(c). Specifically, \u00a78(c)\nprovides:\n    \u201cThe expressing of any views, argument, or opinion, or\n    the dissemination thereof, whether in written,\n    printed, graphic, or visual form, shall not constitute or\n    be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of\n    the provisions of this subchapter, if such expression\n    contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of\n    benefit.\u201d\n   From one vantage, \u00a78(c) \u201cmerely implements the First\nAmendment,\u201d NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575,\n617 (1969), in that it responded to particular constitu-\ntional rulings of the NLRB. See S. Rep. No. 105, 80th\nCong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, pp. 23\u201324 (1947). But its enact-\nment also manifested a \u201ccongressional intent to encourage\nfree debate on issues dividing labor and management.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nLinn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 62 (1966). It is\nindicative of how important Congress deemed such \u201cfree\ndebate\u201d that Congress amended the NLRA rather than\nleaving to the courts the task of correcting the NLRB\u2019s\ndecisions on a case-by-case basis. We have characterized\nthis policy judgment, which suffuses the NLRA as a whole,\nas \u201cfavoring uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate in\nlabor disputes,\u201d stressing that \u201cfreewheeling use of the\nwritten and spoken word . . . has been expressly fostered\nby Congress and approved by the NLRB.\u201d Letter Carriers\nv. Austin, 418 U. S. 264, 272\u2013273 (1974).\n   Congress\u2019 express protection of free debate forcefully\nbuttresses the pre-emption analysis in this case. Under\nMachinists, congressional intent to shield a zone of activ-\nity from regulation is usually found only \u201cimplicit[ly] in\nthe structure of the Act,\u201d Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U. S.\n107, 117, n. 11 (1994), drawing on the notion that \u201c \u2018[w]hat\nCongress left unregulated is as important as the regula-\ntions that it imposed,\u2019 \u201d Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los\nAngeles, 493 U. S. 103, 110 (1989) (Golden State II) (quot-\ning New York Telephone Co. v. New York State Dept. of\nLabor, 440 U. S. 519, 552 (1979) (Powell, J., dissenting)).\nIn the case of noncoercive speech, however, the protection\nis both implicit and explicit. Sections 8(a) and 8(b) dem-\nonstrate that when Congress has sought to put limits on\nadvocacy for or against union organization, it has ex-\npressly set forth the mechanisms for doing so. Moreover,\nthe amendment to \u00a77 calls attention to the right of em-\nployees to refuse to join unions, which implies an underly-\ning right to receive information opposing unionization.\nFinally, the addition of \u00a78(c) expressly precludes regula-\ntion of speech about unionization \u201cso long as the communi-\ncations do not contain a \u2018threat of reprisal or force or\npromise of benefit.\u2019 \u201d Gissel Packing, 395 U.

Stats. ch. 872, \u00a71, is the same policy\njudgment that the NLRB advanced under the Wagner Act,\nand that Congress renounced in the Taft-Hartley Act. To\nthe extent \u00a7\u00a716645.2 and 16645.7 actually further the\nexpress goal of AB 1889, the provisions are unequivocally\npre-empted.\n                             IV\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that Machinists did not\npre-empt \u00a7\u00a716645.2 and 16645.7 for three reasons: (1) the\nspending restrictions apply only to the use of state funds,\n(2) Congress did not leave the zone of activity free from all\nregulation, and (3) California modeled AB 1889 on federal\nstatutes. We find none of these arguments persuasive.\nUse of State Funds\n   In NLRA pre-emption cases, \u201c \u2018judicial concern has\nnecessarily focused on the nature of the activities which\nthe States have sought to regulate, rather than on the\nmethod of regulation adopted.\u2019 \u201d Golden State I, 475 U.

S., at 119 (\u201cPre-emption\nanalysis . . . turns on the actual content of [the State\u2019s]\npolicy and its real effect on federal rights\u201d). California\nplainly could not directly regulate noncoercive speech\nabout unionization by means of an express prohibition. It\nis equally clear that California may not indirectly regulate\nsuch conduct by imposing spending restrictions on the use\nof state funds.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    In Gould, we held that Wisconsin\u2019s policy of refusing to\npurchase goods and services from three-time NLRA viola-\ntors was pre-empted under Garmon because it imposed a\n\u201csupplemental sanction\u201d that conflicted with the NLRA\u2019s\n\u201c \u2018integrated scheme of regulation.\u2019 \u201d 475 U. S., at 288\u2013289.\nWisconsin protested that its debarment statute was \u201can\nexercise of the State\u2019s spending power rather than its\nregulatory power,\u201d but we dismissed this as \u201ca distinction\nwithout a difference.\u201d Id., at 287. \u201c[T]he point of the\nstatute [was] to deter labor law violations,\u201d and \u201cfor all\npractical purposes\u201d the spending restriction was \u201ctanta-\nmount to regulation.\u201d Id., at 287\u2013289. Wisconsin\u2019s choice\n\u201cto use its spending power rather than its police power\nd[id] not significantly lessen the inherent potential for\nconflict\u201d between the state and federal schemes; hence the\nstatute was pre-empted. Id., at 289.\n    We distinguished Gould in Boston Harbor, holding that\nthe NLRA did not preclude a state agency supervising a\nconstruction project from requiring that contractors abide\nby a labor agreement. We explained that when a State\nacts as a \u201cmarket participant with no interest in setting\npolicy,\u201d as opposed to a \u201cregulator,\u201d it does not offend the\npre-emption principles of the NLRA. 507 U. S., at 229. In\nfinding that the state agency had acted as a market par-\nticipant, we stressed that the challenged action \u201cwas\nspecifically tailored to one particular job,\u201d and aimed \u201cto\nensure an efficient project that would be completed as\nquickly and effectively as possible at the lowest cost.\u201d Id.,\nat 232.\n    It is beyond dispute that California enacted AB 1889 in\nits capacity as a regulator rather than a market partici-\npant. AB 1889 is neither \u201cspecifically tailored to one\nparticular job\u201d nor a \u201clegitimate response to state pro-\ncurement constraints or to local economic needs.\u201d Gould,\n475 U. S., at 291. As the statute\u2019s preamble candidly\nacknowledges, the legislative purpose is not the efficient\n10      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nprocurement of goods and services, but the furtherance of\na labor policy. See 2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, \u00a71. Although\na State has a legitimate proprietary interest in ensuring\nthat state funds are spent in accordance with the purposes\nfor which they are appropriated, this is not the objective of\nAB 1889. In contrast to a neutral affirmative requirement\nthat funds be spent solely for the purposes of the relevant\ngrant or program, AB 1889 imposes a targeted negative\nrestriction on employer speech about unionization. Fur-\nthermore, the statute does not even apply this constraint\nuniformly. Instead of forbidding the use of state funds for\nall employer advocacy regarding unionization, AB 1889\npermits use of state funds for select employer advocacy\nactivities that promote unions. Specifically, the statute\nexempts expenses incurred in connection with, inter alia,\ngiving unions access to the workplace, and voluntarily\nrecognizing unions without a secret ballot election.\n\u00a7\u00a716647(b), (d).\n  The Court of Appeals held that although California did\nnot act as a market participant in enacting AB 1889, the\nNLRA did not pre-empt the statute. It purported to dis-\ntinguish Gould on the theory that AB 1889 does not make\nemployer neutrality a condition for receiving funds, but\ninstead restricts only the use of funds. According to the\nCourt of Appeals, this distinction matters because when a\nState imposes a \u201cuse\u201d restriction instead of a \u201creceipt\u201d\nrestriction, \u201can employer has and retains the freedom to\nspend its own funds however it wishes.\u201d 463 F. 3d, at\n1088.\n  California\u2019s reliance on a \u201cuse\u201d restriction rather than a\n\u201creceipt\u201d restriction is, at least in this case, no more conse-\nquential than Wisconsin\u2019s reliance on its spending power\nrather than its police power in Gould. As explained below,\nAB 1889 couples its \u201cuse\u201d restriction with compliance costs\nand litigation risks that are calculated to make union-\nrelated advocacy prohibitively expensive for employers\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat receive state funds. By making it exceedingly diffi-\ncult for employers to demonstrate that they have not used\nstate funds and by imposing punitive sanctions for non-\ncompliance, AB 1889 effectively reaches beyond \u201cthe use of\nfunds over which California maintains a sovereign inter-\nest.\u201d Brief for State Respondents 19.\n   Turning first to the compliance burdens, AB 1889 re-\nquires recipients to \u201cmaintain records sufficient to show\nthat no state funds were used\u201d for prohibited expendi-\ntures, \u00a7\u00a716645.2(c), 16645.7(c), and conclusively presumes\nthat any expenditure to assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing made from \u201ccommingled\u201d funds constitutes a\nviolation of the statute, \u00a716646(b). Maintaining \u201csuffi-\ncient\u201d records and ensuring segregation of funds is no\nsmall feat, given that AB 1889 expansively defines its\nprohibition to encompass \u201cany expense\u201d incurred in \u201cany\nattempt\u201d by an employer to \u201cinfluence the decision of its\nemployees.\u201d \u00a7\u00a716645(a), 16646(a). Prohibited expendi-\ntures include not only discrete expenses such as legal and\nconsulting fees, but also an allocation of overhead, includ-\ning \u201csalaries of supervisors and employees,\u201d for any time\nand resources spent on union-related advocacy. See\n\u00a716646(a). The statute affords no clearly defined safe\nharbor, save for expenses incurred in connection with\nactivities that either favor unions or are required by fed-\neral or state law. See \u00a716647.\n   The statute also imposes deterrent litigation risks.\nSignificantly, AB 1889 authorizes not only the California\nAttorney General but also any private taxpayer\u2014\nincluding, of course, a union in a dispute with an em-\nployer\u2014to bring a civil action against suspected violators\nfor \u201cinjunctive relief, damages, civil penalties, and other\nappropriate equitable relief.\u201d \u00a716645.8. Violators are\nliable to the State for three times the amount of state\nfunds deemed spent on union organizing. \u00a7\u00a716645.2(d),\n16645.7(d), 16645.8(a). Prevailing plaintiffs, and certain\n12      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nprevailing taxpayer intervenors, are entitled to recover\nattorney\u2019s fees and costs, \u00a716645.8(d), which may well\ndwarf the treble damages award. Consequently, a trivial\nviolation of the statute could give rise to substantial liabil-\nity. Finally, even if an employer were confident that it\nhad satisfied the recordkeeping and segregation require-\nments, it would still bear the costs of defending itself\nagainst unions in court, as well as the risk of a mistaken\nadverse finding by the factfinder.\n    In light of these burdens, California\u2019s reliance on a \u201cuse\u201d\nrestriction rather than a \u201creceipt\u201d restriction \u201cdoes not\nsignificantly lessen the inherent potential for conflict\u201d\nbetween AB 1889 and the NLRA. Gould, 475 U. S., at\n289. AB 1889\u2019s enforcement mechanisms put considerable\npressure on an employer either to forgo his \u201cfree speech\nright to communicate his views to his employees,\u201d Gissel\nPacking, 395 U. S., at 617, or else to refuse the receipt of\nany state funds. In so doing, the statute impermissibly\n\u201cpredicat[es] benefits on refraining from conduct protected\nby federal labor law,\u201d Livadas, 512 U. S., at 116, and chills\none side of \u201cthe robust debate which has been protected\nunder the NLRA,\u201d Letter Carriers, 418 U. S., at 275.\n    Resisting this conclusion, the State and the AFL\u2013CIO\ncontend that AB 1889 imposes less onerous recordkeeping\nrestrictions on governmental subsidies than do federal\nrestrictions that have been found not to violate the First\nAmendment. See Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173 (1991);\nRegan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S.\n540 (1983). The question, however, is not whether AB\n1889 violates the First Amendment, but whether it\n\u201c \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu-\ntion of the full purposes and objectives\u2019 \u201d of the NLRA.\nLivadas, 512 U.

Al-\nthough a State may \u201cchoos[e] to fund a program dedicated\nto advance certain permissible goals,\u201d Rust, 400 U.

Stressing\nthat the NLRB has regulated employer speech that takes\nplace on the eve of union elections, the Court of Appeals\ndeemed Machinists inapplicable because \u201cemployer speech\nin the context of organizing\u201d is not a zone of activity that\nCongress left free from \u201call regulation.\u201d See 463 F. 3d, at\n1089 (citing Peoria Plastic Co., 117 N.

Whatever the NLRB\u2019s regulatory\nauthority within special settings such as imminent elec-\ntions, however, Congress has clearly denied it the author-\nity to regulate the broader category of noncoercive speech\nencompassed by AB 1889. It is equally obvious that the\n14       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                        v.

Co. v. Massachusetts,\n471 U.

See 463\nF. 3d, at 1090\u20131091. Specifically, three federal statutes\ninclude provisions that forbid the use of particular grant\nand program funds \u201cto assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing.\u201d2 We are not persuaded that these few iso-\nlated restrictions, plucked from the multitude of federal\nspending programs, were either intended to alter or did in\nfact alter the \u201c \u2018wider contours of federal labor policy.\u2019 \u201d\nMetropolitan Life, 471 U.

We upheld the statute on the\nbasis that the legislative histories of the NLRA and Social\nSecurity Act, which were enacted within six weeks of each\nother, confirmed that \u201cCongress intended that the States\nbe free to authorize, or to prohibit, such payments.\u201d Id., at\n544; see also id., at 547 (Brennan, J., concurring in result);\nid., at 549 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment). In-\ndeed, the tension between the Social Security Act and the\nNLRA suggested that the case could \u201cbe viewed as pre-\nsenting a potential conflict between two federal statutes\n. . . rather than between federal and state regulatory\nstatutes.\u201d Id., at 539\u2013540, n. 32.\n    The three federal statutes relied on by the Court of\nAppeals neither conflict with the NLRA nor otherwise\nestablish that Congress \u201cdecided to tolerate a substantial\nmeasure of diversity\u201d in the regulation of employer speech.\nUnlike the States, Congress has the authority to create\ntailored exceptions to otherwise applicable federal policies,\nand (also unlike the States) it can do so in a manner that\npreserves national uniformity without opening the door to\na 50-state patchwork of inconsistent labor policies. Con-\nsequently, the mere fact that Congress has imposed tar-\ngeted federal restrictions on union-related advocacy in\ncertain limited contexts does not invite the States to over-\nride federal labor policy in other settings.\n    Had Congress enacted a federal version of AB 1889 that\napplied analogous spending restrictions to all federal\ngrants or expenditures, the pre-emption question would be\ncloser. Cf. Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 755 (citing\nfederal minimum labor standards as evidence that Con-\ngress did not intend to pre-empt state minimum labor\nstandards).

Thus the question before us is whether Califor-\nnia\u2019s spending limitations amount to regulation that the\nNLRA pre-empts. In my view, they do not.\n                              I\n   The operative sections of the California statute provide\nthat employers who wish to \u201cassist, promote or deter union\norganizing,\u201d cannot use state money when they do so. The\nmajority finds these provisions pre-empted because in its\nview the sections regulate employer speech in a manner\nthat weakens, or undercuts, a congressional policy, embod-\nied in NLRA \u00a78(c), \u201c \u2018to encourage free debate on issues\ndividing labor and management.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6\u20137 (citing\nLinn v.

In that\ncase, Wisconsin Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U.

It permits\nall employers who receive state funds to \u201cassist, promote,\nor deter union organizing.\u201d It simply says to those em-\nployers, do not do so on our dime. I concede that a federal\nlaw that forces States to pay for labor-related speech from\npublic funds would encourage more of that speech. But no\none can claim that the NLRA is such a law. And without\nsuch a law, a State\u2019s refusal to pay for labor-related speech\ndoes not impermissibly discourage that activity. To refuse\nto pay for an activity (as here) is not the same as to compel\nothers to engage in that activity (as in Gould).\n   Second, California\u2019s operative language does not weaken\nor undercut Congress\u2019 policy of \u201cencourag[ing] free debate\non issues dividing labor and management.\u201d Linn, supra, at\n62. For one thing, employers remain free to spend their\nown money to \u201cassist, promote, or deter\u201d unionization.\nMore importantly, I cannot conclude that California\u2019s\nstatute would weaken or undercut any such congressional\npolicy because Congress itself has enacted three statutes\nthat, using identical language, do precisely the same\nthing. Congress has forbidden recipients of Head Start\nfunds from using the funds to \u201cassist, promote, or deter\nunion organizing.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a79839(e). It has forbidden\nrecipients of Workforce Investment Act of 1998 funds from\nusing the funds to \u201cassist, promote, or deter union organiz-\ning.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a72931(b)(7). And it has forbidden recipi-\nents of National Community Service Act of 1990 funds\nfrom using the funds to \u201cassist, promote, or deter union\norganizing.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a712634(b)(1). Could Congress\nhave thought that the NLRA would prevent the States\nfrom enacting the very same kinds of laws that Congress\nitself has enacted? Far more likely, Congress thought that\n4       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndirecting government funds away from labor-related activ-\nity was consistent, not inconsistent, with, the policy of\n\u201cencourag[ing] free debate\u201d embedded in its labor statutes.\n   Finally, the law normally gives legislatures broad au-\nthority to decide how to spend the People\u2019s money. A\nlegislature, after all, generally has the right not to fund\nactivities that it would prefer not to fund\u2014even where the\nactivities are otherwise protected. See, e.g., Regan v.\nTaxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549\n(1983) (\u201cWe have held in several contexts that a legisla-\nture\u2019s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamen-\ntal right does not infringe the right\u201d). This Court has\nmade the same point in the context of labor law. See Lyng\nv. Automobile Workers, 485 U. S. 360, 368 (1988) (holding\nthat the Federal Government\u2019s refusal to provide food\nstamp benefits to striking workers was justified because\n\u201c[s]trikers and their union would be much better off if food\nstamps were available,\u201d but the \u201cstrikers\u2019 right of associa-\ntion does not require the Government to furnish funds to\nmaximize the exercise of that right\u201d).\n   As far as I can tell, States that do wish to pay for em-\nployer speech are generally free to do so. They might\nmake clear, for example, through grant-related rules and\nregulations that a grant recipient can use the funds to pay\nsalaries and overhead, which salaries and overhead might\ninclude expenditures related to management\u2019s role in\nlabor organizing contests. If so, why should States that do\nnot wish to pay be deprived of a similar freedom? Why\nshould they be conscripted into paying?\n   I can find nothing in the majority\u2019s arguments that\nconvincingly answers these questions. The majority says\nthat California must be acting as an impermissible regula-\ntor because it is not acting as a \u201cmarket participant\u201d (a\nrole we all agree would permit it broad leeway to act like\nprivate firms in respect to labor matters). Ante, at 9. But\nthe regulator/market-participant distinction suggests a\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfalse dichotomy. The converse of \u201cmarket participant\u201d is\nnot necessarily \u201cregulator.\u201d A State may appropriate\nfunds without either participating in or regulating the\nlabor market. And the NLRA pre-empts a State\u2019s actions,\nwhen taken as an \u201cappropriator,\u201d only if those actions\namount to impermissible regulation. I have explained\nwhy I believe that California\u2019s actions do not amount to\nimpermissible regulation here.\n  The majority also complains that the statute \u201cimposes a\ntargeted negative restriction,\u201d one applicable only to labor.\nAnte, at 10. I do not find this a fatal objection, because the\ncongressional statutes just discussed (which I believe are\nconsistent with the NLRA) do exactly the same. In any\nevent, if, say, a State can tell employers not to use state\nfunds to pay for a large category of expenses (say, over-\nhead), why can it not tell employers the same about a\nsmaller category of expenses (say, only those overhead\nexpenses related to taking sides in a labor contest). And\nwhere would the line then be drawn? Would the statute\npass master if California had said, do not use our money\nto pay for interior decorating, catered lunches, or labor\nrelations?\n  The majority further objects to the fact that the statute\ndoes not \u201capply\u201d the constraint \u201cuniformly,\u201d because it\npermits use of state funds for \u201cselect employer advocacy\nactivities that promote unions.\u201d Ante, at 10. That last\nphrase presumably refers to an exception in the California\nstatute that permits employers to spend state funds to\nnegotiate a voluntary recognition of a union. But this\nexception underscores California\u2019s basic purpose\u2014\nmaintaining a position of spending neutrality on contested\nlabor matters. Where labor and management agree on\nunionization, there is no conflict.\n                             II\n  I turn now to the statute\u2019s compliance provisions. They\n6       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrequire grant recipients to maintain \u201crecords sufficient to\nshow that no state funds were used\u201d for prohibited expen-\nditures; they deter the use of commingled funds for prohib-\nited expenditures; and they impose serious penalties upon\nviolators. Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a716645.2(c), 16645.7(b)\u2013\n(c). The majority seems to rest its conclusions in part\nupon its belief that these requirements are too strict, that,\nunder the guise of neutral enforcement, they discourage\nthe use of nonstate money to engage in free debate on\nlabor/management issues. Ante, at 10\u201311.\n   I agree with the majority that, should the compliance\nprovisions, as a practical matter, unreasonably discourage\nexpenditure of nonstate funds, the NLRA may well pre-\nempt California\u2019s statute. But I cannot say on the basis of\nthe record before us that the statute will have that effect.\n   The language of the statute is clear. The statute re-\nquires recipients of state money to \u201cmaintain records\nsufficient to show that no state funds were used\u201d for pro-\nhibited expenditures. \u00a7\u00a716645.2, 16645.7(c). And the\nclass of prohibited expenditures is quite broad: It covers\n\u201cany expense\u201d incurred in \u201cany attempt\u201d by an employer to\n\u201cinfluence the decision of its employees,\u201d including \u201clegal\nand consulting fees and salaries of supervisors and em-\nployees\u201d incurred during research for or the preparation,\nplanning, coordination, or execution of activities to \u201cassist,\npromote, or deter\u201d union organizing. \u00a716646(a) (emphasis\nadded). And where an employer mingles state funds and\nnon-state funds, (say, to pay a particular employee who\nspends part of her time dealing with unionization matters)\nthe employer must determine \u201con a pro rata basis,\u201d the\nportion of the labor-related expenditure paid for by state\nfunds, and maintain sufficient supporting documentation.\n\u00a716646(b). Any violation of these provisions is then sub-\nject to strict penalties, including treble damages and\nattorney\u2019s fees and costs. \u00a716645.8.\n   What is less clear is the degree to which these provi-\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)             7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsions actually will deter a recipient of state funds from\nusing non-state funds to engage in unionization matters.\nAnd no lower court has ruled on this matter. In the Dis-\ntrict Court, the Chamber of Commerce moved for sum-\nmary judgment arguing that the statute, by placing re-\nstrictions on state funds, was pre-empted by Machinists\nand Garmon and also arguing that the compliance provi-\nsions are so burdensome that they would chill even private\nexpenditures. California opposed the motion. And Cali-\nfornia submitted expert evidence designed to show that its\n\u201caccounting and recordkeeping requirements . . . are simi-\nlar to requirements imposed in other contexts,\u201d are \u201csig-\nnificantly less burdensome than the detailed requirements\nfor federal grant recipients,\u201d and allow \u201cflexibility in estab-\nlishing proper accounting procedures and controls.\u201d App.\n282\u2013283.\n   The District Court granted the Chamber of Commerce\u2019s\nmotion for summary judgment in part, finding that the\noperative sections of the statute were pre-empted for the\nreasons I have discussed in Part I, namely, that the opera-\ntive provisions interfered with the NLRA\u2019s policy of en-\ncouraging \u201cfree debate.\u201d 225 F. Supp. 2d 1199, 1204 (CD\nCal. 2002). But in doing so, it did not address the Cham-\nber of Commerce\u2019s argument that the California statute\u2019s\ncompliance provisions affected non-state-funded speech to\nthe point that the NLRA pre-empted the statute. Neither\ndid the Court of Appeals address the question whether the\ncompliance provisions themselves constitute sufficient\ngrounds for finding the statute pre-empted.\n   I do not believe that we can, and I would not, decide this\nquestion until the lower courts have had an opportunity to\nconsider and rule upon the compliance-related questions.\nAccordingly, I would vote to vacate the judgment of the\nNinth Circuit and remand for further proceedings on this\nissue.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n",

Govt. Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a716645\u201316649 (West Supp. 2008).

Stats. ch. 872, \u00a71.\n   AB 1889 forbids certain employers that receive state\nfunds\u2014whether by reimbursement, grant, contract, use of\nstate property, or pursuant to a state program\u2014from\nusing such funds to \u201cassist, promote, or deter union orga-\nnizing.\u201d See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a716645.1 to 16645.7.\nThis prohibition encompasses \u201cany attempt by an em-\nployer to influence the decision of its employees\u201d regarding\n\u201c[w]hether to support or oppose a labor organization\u201d and\n\u201c[w]hether to become a member of any labor organization.\u201d\n\u00a716645(a). The statute specifies that the spending restric-\ntion applies to \u201cany expense, including legal and consult-\ning fees and salaries of supervisors and employees, in-\ncurred for . . . an activity to assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing.\u201d \u00a716646(a).\n   Despite the neutral statement of policy quoted above,\nAB 1889 expressly exempts \u201cactivit[ies] performed\u201d or\n\u201cexpense[s] incurred\u201d in connection with certain undertak-\nings that promote unionization, including \u201c[a]llowing a\nlabor organization or its representatives access to the\nemployer\u2019s facilities or property,\u201d and \u201c[n]egotiating, enter-\ning into, or carrying out a voluntary recognition agree-\nment with a labor organization.\u201d \u00a7\u00a716647(b), (d).\n   To ensure compliance with the grant and program re-\nstrictions at issue in this case, AB 1889 establishes a\nformidable enforcement scheme.

While the en banc majority agreed that\nCalifornia enacted \u00a7\u00a716645.2 and 16645.7 in its capacity\nas a regulator, and not as a mere proprietor or market\nparticipant, see id., at 1082\u20131085, it concluded that Con-\ngress did not intend to preclude States from imposing such\nrestrictions on the use of their own funds, see id., at 1085\u2013\n1096. We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), and\nnow reverse.\n   Although the NLRA itself contains no express pre-\nemption provision, we have held that Congress implicitly\nmandated two types of pre-emption as necessary to im-\nplement federal labor policy.

S. 236 (1959), \u201cis intended to preclude\nstate interference with the National Labor Relations\nBoard\u2019s interpretation and active enforcement of the \u2018inte-\ngrated scheme of regulation\u2019 established by the NLRA.\u201d\nGolden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 475 U. S. 608,\n613 (1986) (Golden State I). To this end, Garmon pre-\nemption forbids States to \u201cregulate activity that the NLRA\nprotects, prohibits, or arguably protects or prohibits.\u201d\nWisconsin Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282,\n286 (1986).      The second, known as Machinists pre-\nemption, forbids both the National Labor Relations Board\n(NLRB) and States to regulate conduct that Congress\nintended \u201cbe unregulated because left \u2018to be controlled by\nthe free play of economic forces.\u2019 \u201d Machinists v. Wisconsin\nEmployment Relations Comm\u2019n, 427 U. S. 132, 140 (1976)\n(quoting NLRB v. Nash-Finch Co., 404 U. S. 138, 144\n(1971)). Machinists pre-emption is based on the premise\nthat \u201c \u2018Congress struck a balance of protection, prohibition,\nand laissez-faire in respect to union organization, collec-\ntive bargaining, and labor disputes.\u2019 \u201d 427 U. S., at 140,\nn. 4 (quoting Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85\nHarv. L. Rev. 1337, 1352 (1972)).\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Today we hold that \u00a7\u00a716645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-\nempted under Machinists because they regulate within \u201ca\nzone protected and reserved for market freedom.\u201d Build-\ning & Constr. Trades Council v. Associated Builders &\nContractors of Mass./R. I., Inc., 507 U. S. 218, 227 (1993)\n(Boston Harbor). We do not reach the question whether\nthe provisions would also be pre-empted under Garmon.\n                              III\n   As enacted in 1935, the NLRA, which was commonly\nknown as the Wagner Act, did not include any provision\nthat specifically addressed the intersection between em-\nployee organizational rights and employer speech rights.\nSee 49 Stat. 449. Rather, it was left to the NLRB, subject\nto review in federal court, to reconcile these interests in its\nconstruction of \u00a7\u00a77 and 8. Section 7, now codified at 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7157, provided that workers have the right to\norganize, to bargain collectively, and to engage in con-\ncerted activity for their mutual aid and protection. Sec-\ntion 8(1), now codified at 29 U. S. C. \u00a7158(a)(1), made it an\n\u201cunfair labor practice\u201d for employers to \u201cinterfere with,\nrestrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights\nguaranteed by section 7.\u201d\n   Among the frequently litigated issues under the Wagner\nAct were charges that an employer\u2019s attempts to persuade\nemployees not to join a union\u2014or to join one favored by\nthe employer rather than a rival\u2014amounted to a form of\ncoercion prohibited by \u00a78. The NLRB took the position\nthat \u00a78 demanded complete employer neutrality during\norganizing campaigns, reasoning that any partisan em-\nployer speech about unions would interfere with the \u00a77\nrights of employees. See 1 J. Higgins, The Developing\nLabor Law 94 (5th ed. 2006). In 1941, this Court curtailed\nthe NLRB\u2019s aggressive interpretation, clarifying that\nnothing in the NLRA prohibits an employer \u201cfrom express-\ning its view on labor policies or problems\u201d unless the em-\n6      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nployer\u2019s speech \u201cin connection with other circumstances\n[amounts] to coercion within the meaning of the Act.\u201d\nNLRB v. Virginia Elec. & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469, 477\n(1941). We subsequently characterized Virginia Electric\nas recognizing the First Amendment right of employers to\nengage in noncoercive speech about unionization. Thomas\nv. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 537\u2013538 (1945). Notwithstand-\ning these decisions, the NLRB continued to regulate em-\nployer speech too restrictively in the eyes of Congress.\n  Concerned that the Wagner Act had pushed the labor\nrelations balance too far in favor of unions, Congress\npassed the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Taft-\nHartley Act). 61 Stat. 136. The Taft-Hartley Act amended\n\u00a7\u00a77 and 8 in several key respects. First, it emphasized\nthat employees \u201chave the right to refrain from any or all\u201d\n\u00a77 activities. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7157. Second, it added \u00a78(b),\nwhich prohibits unfair labor practices by unions. 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7158(b). Third, it added \u00a78(c), which protects\nspeech by both unions and employers from regulation\nby the NLRB. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7158(c). Specifically, \u00a78(c)\nprovides:\n    \u201cThe expressing of any views, argument, or opinion, or\n    the dissemination thereof, whether in written,\n    printed, graphic, or visual form, shall not constitute or\n    be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of\n    the provisions of this subchapter, if such expression\n    contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of\n    benefit.\u201d\n   From one vantage, \u00a78(c) \u201cmerely implements the First\nAmendment,\u201d NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575,\n617 (1969), in that it responded to particular constitu-\ntional rulings of the NLRB. See S. Rep. No. 105, 80th\nCong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, pp. 23\u201324 (1947). But its enact-\nment also manifested a \u201ccongressional intent to encourage\nfree debate on issues dividing labor and management.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nLinn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 62 (1966). It is\nindicative of how important Congress deemed such \u201cfree\ndebate\u201d that Congress amended the NLRA rather than\nleaving to the courts the task of correcting the NLRB\u2019s\ndecisions on a case-by-case basis. We have characterized\nthis policy judgment, which suffuses the NLRA as a whole,\nas \u201cfavoring uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate in\nlabor disputes,\u201d stressing that \u201cfreewheeling use of the\nwritten and spoken word . . . has been expressly fostered\nby Congress and approved by the NLRB.\u201d Letter Carriers\nv. Austin, 418 U. S. 264, 272\u2013273 (1974).\n   Congress\u2019 express protection of free debate forcefully\nbuttresses the pre-emption analysis in this case. Under\nMachinists, congressional intent to shield a zone of activ-\nity from regulation is usually found only \u201cimplicit[ly] in\nthe structure of the Act,\u201d Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U. S.\n107, 117, n. 11 (1994), drawing on the notion that \u201c \u2018[w]hat\nCongress left unregulated is as important as the regula-\ntions that it imposed,\u2019 \u201d Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los\nAngeles, 493 U. S. 103, 110 (1989) (Golden State II) (quot-\ning New York Telephone Co. v. New York State Dept. of\nLabor, 440 U. S. 519, 552 (1979) (Powell, J., dissenting)).\nIn the case of noncoercive speech, however, the protection\nis both implicit and explicit. Sections 8(a) and 8(b) dem-\nonstrate that when Congress has sought to put limits on\nadvocacy for or against union organization, it has ex-\npressly set forth the mechanisms for doing so. Moreover,\nthe amendment to \u00a77 calls attention to the right of em-\nployees to refuse to join unions, which implies an underly-\ning right to receive information opposing unionization.\nFinally, the addition of \u00a78(c) expressly precludes regula-\ntion of speech about unionization \u201cso long as the communi-\ncations do not contain a \u2018threat of reprisal or force or\npromise of benefit.\u2019 \u201d Gissel Packing, 395 U. S., at 618.\n   The explicit direction from Congress to leave noncoer-\ncive speech unregulated makes this case easier, in at least\n8       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\none respect, than previous NLRA cases because it does not\nrequire us \u201cto decipher the presumed intent of Congress in\nthe face of that body\u2019s steadfast silence.\u201d Sears, Roebuck\n& Co. v. Carpenters, 436 U. S. 180, 188, n. 12 (1978).\nCalifornia\u2019s policy judgment that partisan employer\nspeech necessarily \u201cinterfere[s] with an employee\u2019s choice\nabout whether to join or to be represented by a labor\nunion,\u201d 2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, \u00a71, is the same policy\njudgment that the NLRB advanced under the Wagner Act,\nand that Congress renounced in the Taft-Hartley Act. To\nthe extent \u00a7\u00a716645.2 and 16645.7 actually further the\nexpress goal of AB 1889, the provisions are unequivocally\npre-empted.\n                             IV\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that Machinists did not\npre-empt \u00a7\u00a716645.2 and 16645.7 for three reasons: (1) the\nspending restrictions apply only to the use of state funds,\n(2) Congress did not leave the zone of activity free from all\nregulation, and (3) California modeled AB 1889 on federal\nstatutes. We find none of these arguments persuasive.\nUse of State Funds\n   In NLRA pre-emption cases, \u201c \u2018judicial concern has\nnecessarily focused on the nature of the activities which\nthe States have sought to regulate, rather than on the\nmethod of regulation adopted.\u2019 \u201d Golden State I, 475 U. S.,\nat 614, n. 5 (quoting Garmon, 359 U. S., at 243; brackets\nomitted); see also Livadas, 512 U. S., at 119 (\u201cPre-emption\nanalysis . . . turns on the actual content of [the State\u2019s]\npolicy and its real effect on federal rights\u201d). California\nplainly could not directly regulate noncoercive speech\nabout unionization by means of an express prohibition. It\nis equally clear that California may not indirectly regulate\nsuch conduct by imposing spending restrictions on the use\nof state funds.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    In Gould, we held that Wisconsin\u2019s policy of refusing to\npurchase goods and services from three-time NLRA viola-\ntors was pre-empted under Garmon because it imposed a\n\u201csupplemental sanction\u201d that conflicted with the NLRA\u2019s\n\u201c \u2018integrated scheme of regulation.\u2019 \u201d 475 U. S., at 288\u2013289.\nWisconsin protested that its debarment statute was \u201can\nexercise of the State\u2019s spending power rather than its\nregulatory power,\u201d but we dismissed this as \u201ca distinction\nwithout a difference.\u201d Id., at 287. \u201c[T]he point of the\nstatute [was] to deter labor law violations,\u201d and \u201cfor all\npractical purposes\u201d the spending restriction was \u201ctanta-\nmount to regulation.\u201d Id., at 287\u2013289. Wisconsin\u2019s choice\n\u201cto use its spending power rather than its police power\nd[id] not significantly lessen the inherent potential for\nconflict\u201d between the state and federal schemes; hence the\nstatute was pre-empted. Id., at 289.\n    We distinguished Gould in Boston Harbor, holding that\nthe NLRA did not preclude a state agency supervising a\nconstruction project from requiring that contractors abide\nby a labor agreement. We explained that when a State\nacts as a \u201cmarket participant with no interest in setting\npolicy,\u201d as opposed to a \u201cregulator,\u201d it does not offend the\npre-emption principles of the NLRA. 507 U. S., at 229. In\nfinding that the state agency had acted as a market par-\nticipant, we stressed that the challenged action \u201cwas\nspecifically tailored to one particular job,\u201d and aimed \u201cto\nensure an efficient project that would be completed as\nquickly and effectively as possible at the lowest cost.\u201d Id.,\nat 232.\n    It is beyond dispute that California enacted AB 1889 in\nits capacity as a regulator rather than a market partici-\npant. AB 1889 is neither \u201cspecifically tailored to one\nparticular job\u201d nor a \u201clegitimate response to state pro-\ncurement constraints or to local economic needs.\u201d Gould,\n475 U. S., at 291. As the statute\u2019s preamble candidly\nacknowledges, the legislative purpose is not the efficient\n10      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nprocurement of goods and services, but the furtherance of\na labor policy. See 2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, \u00a71. Although\na State has a legitimate proprietary interest in ensuring\nthat state funds are spent in accordance with the purposes\nfor which they are appropriated, this is not the objective of\nAB 1889. In contrast to a neutral affirmative requirement\nthat funds be spent solely for the purposes of the relevant\ngrant or program, AB 1889 imposes a targeted negative\nrestriction on employer speech about unionization. Fur-\nthermore, the statute does not even apply this constraint\nuniformly. Instead of forbidding the use of state funds for\nall employer advocacy regarding unionization, AB 1889\npermits use of state funds for select employer advocacy\nactivities that promote unions. Specifically, the statute\nexempts expenses incurred in connection with, inter alia,\ngiving unions access to the workplace, and voluntarily\nrecognizing unions without a secret ballot election.\n\u00a7\u00a716647(b), (d).\n  The Court of Appeals held that although California did\nnot act as a market participant in enacting AB 1889, the\nNLRA did not pre-empt the statute. It purported to dis-\ntinguish Gould on the theory that AB 1889 does not make\nemployer neutrality a condition for receiving funds, but\ninstead restricts only the use of funds. According to the\nCourt of Appeals, this distinction matters because when a\nState imposes a \u201cuse\u201d restriction instead of a \u201creceipt\u201d\nrestriction, \u201can employer has and retains the freedom to\nspend its own funds however it wishes.\u201d 463 F. 3d, at\n1088.\n  California\u2019s reliance on a \u201cuse\u201d restriction rather than a\n\u201creceipt\u201d restriction is, at least in this case, no more conse-\nquential than Wisconsin\u2019s reliance on its spending power\nrather than its police power in Gould. As explained below,\nAB 1889 couples its \u201cuse\u201d restriction with compliance costs\nand litigation risks that are calculated to make union-\nrelated advocacy prohibitively expensive for employers\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat receive state funds. By making it exceedingly diffi-\ncult for employers to demonstrate that they have not used\nstate funds and by imposing punitive sanctions for non-\ncompliance, AB 1889 effectively reaches beyond \u201cthe use of\nfunds over which California maintains a sovereign inter-\nest.\u201d Brief for State Respondents 19.\n   Turning first to the compliance burdens, AB 1889 re-\nquires recipients to \u201cmaintain records sufficient to show\nthat no state funds were used\u201d for prohibited expendi-\ntures, \u00a7\u00a716645.2(c), 16645.7(c), and conclusively presumes\nthat any expenditure to assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing made from \u201ccommingled\u201d funds constitutes a\nviolation of the statute, \u00a716646(b). Maintaining \u201csuffi-\ncient\u201d records and ensuring segregation of funds is no\nsmall feat, given that AB 1889 expansively defines its\nprohibition to encompass \u201cany expense\u201d incurred in \u201cany\nattempt\u201d by an employer to \u201cinfluence the decision of its\nemployees.\u201d \u00a7\u00a716645(a), 16646(a). Prohibited expendi-\ntures include not only discrete expenses such as legal and\nconsulting fees, but also an allocation of overhead, includ-\ning \u201csalaries of supervisors and employees,\u201d for any time\nand resources spent on union-related advocacy. See\n\u00a716646(a). The statute affords no clearly defined safe\nharbor, save for expenses incurred in connection with\nactivities that either favor unions or are required by fed-\neral or state law. See \u00a716647.\n   The statute also imposes deterrent litigation risks.\nSignificantly, AB 1889 authorizes not only the California\nAttorney General but also any private taxpayer\u2014\nincluding, of course, a union in a dispute with an em-\nployer\u2014to bring a civil action against suspected violators\nfor \u201cinjunctive relief, damages, civil penalties, and other\nappropriate equitable relief.\u201d \u00a716645.8. Violators are\nliable to the State for three times the amount of state\nfunds deemed spent on union organizing. \u00a7\u00a716645.2(d),\n16645.7(d), 16645.8(a). Prevailing plaintiffs, and certain\n12      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nprevailing taxpayer intervenors, are entitled to recover\nattorney\u2019s fees and costs, \u00a716645.8(d), which may well\ndwarf the treble damages award. Consequently, a trivial\nviolation of the statute could give rise to substantial liabil-\nity. Finally, even if an employer were confident that it\nhad satisfied the recordkeeping and segregation require-\nments, it would still bear the costs of defending itself\nagainst unions in court, as well as the risk of a mistaken\nadverse finding by the factfinder.\n    In light of these burdens, California\u2019s reliance on a \u201cuse\u201d\nrestriction rather than a \u201creceipt\u201d restriction \u201cdoes not\nsignificantly lessen the inherent potential for conflict\u201d\nbetween AB 1889 and the NLRA. Gould, 475 U. S., at\n289. AB 1889\u2019s enforcement mechanisms put considerable\npressure on an employer either to forgo his \u201cfree speech\nright to communicate his views to his employees,\u201d Gissel\nPacking, 395 U. S., at 617, or else to refuse the receipt of\nany state funds. In so doing, the statute impermissibly\n\u201cpredicat[es] benefits on refraining from conduct protected\nby federal labor law,\u201d Livadas, 512 U. S., at 116, and chills\none side of \u201cthe robust debate which has been protected\nunder the NLRA,\u201d Letter Carriers, 418 U. S., at 275.\n    Resisting this conclusion, the State and the AFL\u2013CIO\ncontend that AB 1889 imposes less onerous recordkeeping\nrestrictions on governmental subsidies than do federal\nrestrictions that have been found not to violate the First\nAmendment. See Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173 (1991);\nRegan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S.\n540 (1983). The question, however, is not whether AB\n1889 violates the First Amendment, but whether it\n\u201c \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu-\ntion of the full purposes and objectives\u2019 \u201d of the NLRA.\nLivadas, 512 U.

Al-\nthough a State may \u201cchoos[e] to fund a program dedicated\nto advance certain permissible goals,\u201d Rust, 400 U.

S., at 226. Stressing\nthat the NLRB has regulated employer speech that takes\nplace on the eve of union elections, the Court of Appeals\ndeemed Machinists inapplicable because \u201cemployer speech\nin the context of organizing\u201d is not a zone of activity that\nCongress left free from \u201call regulation.\u201d See 463 F. 3d, at\n1089 (citing Peoria Plastic Co., 117 N.

Whatever the NLRB\u2019s regulatory\nauthority within special settings such as imminent elec-\ntions, however, Congress has clearly denied it the author-\nity to regulate the broader category of noncoercive speech\nencompassed by AB 1889. It is equally obvious that the\n14       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                        v.

Co. v. Massachusetts,\n471 U.

See 463\nF. 3d, at 1090\u20131091. Specifically, three federal statutes\ninclude provisions that forbid the use of particular grant\nand program funds \u201cto assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing.\u201d2 We are not persuaded that these few iso-\nlated restrictions, plucked from the multitude of federal\nspending programs, were either intended to alter or did in\nfact alter the \u201c \u2018wider contours of federal labor policy.\u2019 \u201d\nMetropolitan Life, 471 U.

We upheld the statute on the\nbasis that the legislative histories of the NLRA and Social\nSecurity Act, which were enacted within six weeks of each\nother, confirmed that \u201cCongress intended that the States\nbe free to authorize, or to prohibit, such payments.\u201d Id., at\n544; see also id., at 547 (Brennan, J., concurring in result);\nid., at 549 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment). In-\ndeed, the tension between the Social Security Act and the\nNLRA suggested that the case could \u201cbe viewed as pre-\nsenting a potential conflict between two federal statutes\n. . . rather than between federal and state regulatory\nstatutes.\u201d Id., at 539\u2013540, n. 32.\n    The three federal statutes relied on by the Court of\nAppeals neither conflict with the NLRA nor otherwise\nestablish that Congress \u201cdecided to tolerate a substantial\nmeasure of diversity\u201d in the regulation of employer speech.\nUnlike the States, Congress has the authority to create\ntailored exceptions to otherwise applicable federal policies,\nand (also unlike the States) it can do so in a manner that\npreserves national uniformity without opening the door to\na 50-state patchwork of inconsistent labor policies. Con-\nsequently, the mere fact that Congress has imposed tar-\ngeted federal restrictions on union-related advocacy in\ncertain limited contexts does not invite the States to over-\nride federal labor policy in other settings.\n    Had Congress enacted a federal version of AB 1889 that\napplied analogous spending restrictions to all federal\ngrants or expenditures, the pre-emption question would be\ncloser. Cf. Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 755 (citing\nfederal minimum labor standards as evidence that Con-\ngress did not intend to pre-empt state minimum labor\nstandards). But none of the cited statutes is Government-\nwide in scope, none contains comparable remedial provi-\nsions, and none contains express pro-union exemptions.\n16      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v.

Stats. ch. 872, \u00a71.\nThe operative sections of the law prohibit several classes\nof employers who receive state funds from using those\nfunds to \u201cassist, promote, or deter union organizing.\u201d Cal.\nGovt. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a716645\u201316649 (West Supp. 2008). And\nvarious compliance provisions then require maintenance\nof \u201crecords sufficient to show that no state funds were\nused\u201d for prohibited expenditures, deter the use of com-\nmingled funds for prohibited expenditures, and impose\nserious penalties upon violators. \u00a7\u00a716645.2(c), 16645.7(b)\u2013\n(c).\n   The Court finds that the National Labor Relations Act\n(NLRA) pre-empts these provisions. It does so, for it\nbelieves the provisions \u201cregulate\u201d activity that Congress\nhas intended to \u201cbe unregulated because left to be con-\ntrolled by the free play of economic forces.\u201d Machinists v.\nWisconsin Employment Relations Comm\u2019n, 427 U. S. 132,\n140 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted and empha-\nsis added). The Chamber of Commerce adds that the\n2       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nNLRA pre-empts these provisions because they \u201cregulate\nactivity that the NLRA protects, prohibits, or arguably\nprotects or prohibits.\u201d Wisconsin Dept. of Industry v.\nGould Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 286 (1986) (summarizing the\npre-emption principle set forth in San Diego Building\nTrades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 (1959); emphasis\nadded). Thus the question before us is whether Califor-\nnia\u2019s spending limitations amount to regulation that the\nNLRA pre-empts. In my view, they do not.\n                              I\n   The operative sections of the California statute provide\nthat employers who wish to \u201cassist, promote or deter union\norganizing,\u201d cannot use state money when they do so. The\nmajority finds these provisions pre-empted because in its\nview the sections regulate employer speech in a manner\nthat weakens, or undercuts, a congressional policy, embod-\nied in NLRA \u00a78(c), \u201c \u2018to encourage free debate on issues\ndividing labor and management.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6\u20137 (citing\nLinn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 62 (1966)).\n   Although I agree the congressional policy favors \u201cfree\ndebate,\u201d I do not believe the operative provisions of the\nCalifornia statute amount to impermissible regulation\nthat interferes with that policy as Congress intended it.\nFirst, the only relevant Supreme Court case that found a\nState\u2019s labor-related spending limitations to be pre-\nempted differs radically from the case before us. In that\ncase, Wisconsin Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S.\n282, the Court considered a Wisconsin statute that prohib-\nited the State from doing business with firms that repeat-\nedly violated the NLRA. The Court said that the statute\u2019s\n\u201cmanifest purpose and inevitable effect\u201d was \u201cto enforce\u201d\nthe NLRA\u2019s requirements, which \u201crole Congress reserved\nexclusively for the [National Labor Relations Board].\u201d Id.,\nat 291. In a word, the Wisconsin statute sought \u201cto compel\nconformity with the NLRA.\u201d Building & Constr. Trades\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCouncil v. Associated Builders & Contractors of Mass./R.\nI., Inc., 507 U. S. 218, 228 (1993) (emphasis added).\n   California\u2019s statute differs from the Wisconsin statute\nbecause it does not seek to compel labor-related activity.\nNor does it seek to forbid labor-related activity. It permits\nall employers who receive state funds to \u201cassist, promote,\nor deter union organizing.\u201d It simply says to those em-\nployers, do not do so on our dime. I concede that a federal\nlaw that forces States to pay for labor-related speech from\npublic funds would encourage more of that speech. But no\none can claim that the NLRA is such a law. And without\nsuch a law, a State\u2019s refusal to pay for labor-related speech\ndoes not impermissibly discourage that activity. To refuse\nto pay for an activity (as here) is not the same as to compel\nothers to engage in that activity (as in Gould).\n   Second, California\u2019s operative language does not weaken\nor undercut Congress\u2019 policy of \u201cencourag[ing] free debate\non issues dividing labor and management.\u201d Linn, supra, at\n62. For one thing, employers remain free to spend their\nown money to \u201cassist, promote, or deter\u201d unionization.\nMore importantly, I cannot conclude that California\u2019s\nstatute would weaken or undercut any such congressional\npolicy because Congress itself has enacted three statutes\nthat, using identical language, do precisely the same\nthing. Congress has forbidden recipients of Head Start\nfunds from using the funds to \u201cassist, promote, or deter\nunion organizing.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a79839(e). It has forbidden\nrecipients of Workforce Investment Act of 1998 funds from\nusing the funds to \u201cassist, promote, or deter union organiz-\ning.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a72931(b)(7). And it has forbidden recipi-\nents of National Community Service Act of 1990 funds\nfrom using the funds to \u201cassist, promote, or deter union\norganizing.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a712634(b)(1). Could Congress\nhave thought that the NLRA would prevent the States\nfrom enacting the very same kinds of laws that Congress\nitself has enacted? Far more likely, Congress thought that\n4       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndirecting government funds away from labor-related activ-\nity was consistent, not inconsistent, with, the policy of\n\u201cencourag[ing] free debate\u201d embedded in its labor statutes.\n   Finally, the law normally gives legislatures broad au-\nthority to decide how to spend the People\u2019s money. A\nlegislature, after all, generally has the right not to fund\nactivities that it would prefer not to fund\u2014even where the\nactivities are otherwise protected. See, e.g., Regan v.\nTaxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549\n(1983) (\u201cWe have held in several contexts that a legisla-\nture\u2019s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamen-\ntal right does not infringe the right\u201d). This Court has\nmade the same point in the context of labor law. See Lyng\nv. Automobile Workers, 485 U. S. 360, 368 (1988) (holding\nthat the Federal Government\u2019s refusal to provide food\nstamp benefits to striking workers was justified because\n\u201c[s]trikers and their union would be much better off if food\nstamps were available,\u201d but the \u201cstrikers\u2019 right of associa-\ntion does not require the Government to furnish funds to\nmaximize the exercise of that right\u201d).\n   As far as I can tell, States that do wish to pay for em-\nployer speech are generally free to do so. They might\nmake clear, for example, through grant-related rules and\nregulations that a grant recipient can use the funds to pay\nsalaries and overhead, which salaries and overhead might\ninclude expenditures related to management\u2019s role in\nlabor organizing contests. If so, why should States that do\nnot wish to pay be deprived of a similar freedom? Why\nshould they be conscripted into paying?\n   I can find nothing in the majority\u2019s arguments that\nconvincingly answers these questions. The majority says\nthat California must be acting as an impermissible regula-\ntor because it is not acting as a \u201cmarket participant\u201d (a\nrole we all agree would permit it broad leeway to act like\nprivate firms in respect to labor matters). Ante, at 9. But\nthe regulator/market-participant distinction suggests a\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfalse dichotomy. The converse of \u201cmarket participant\u201d is\nnot necessarily \u201cregulator.\u201d A State may appropriate\nfunds without either participating in or regulating the\nlabor market. And the NLRA pre-empts a State\u2019s actions,\nwhen taken as an \u201cappropriator,\u201d only if those actions\namount to impermissible regulation. I have explained\nwhy I believe that California\u2019s actions do not amount to\nimpermissible regulation here.\n  The majority also complains that the statute \u201cimposes a\ntargeted negative restriction,\u201d one applicable only to labor.\nAnte, at 10. I do not find this a fatal objection, because the\ncongressional statutes just discussed (which I believe are\nconsistent with the NLRA) do exactly the same. In any\nevent, if, say, a State can tell employers not to use state\nfunds to pay for a large category of expenses (say, over-\nhead), why can it not tell employers the same about a\nsmaller category of expenses (say, only those overhead\nexpenses related to taking sides in a labor contest). And\nwhere would the line then be drawn? Would the statute\npass master if California had said, do not use our money\nto pay for interior decorating, catered lunches, or labor\nrelations?\n  The majority further objects to the fact that the statute\ndoes not \u201capply\u201d the constraint \u201cuniformly,\u201d because it\npermits use of state funds for \u201cselect employer advocacy\nactivities that promote unions.\u201d Ante, at 10. That last\nphrase presumably refers to an exception in the California\nstatute that permits employers to spend state funds to\nnegotiate a voluntary recognition of a union. But this\nexception underscores California\u2019s basic purpose\u2014\nmaintaining a position of spending neutrality on contested\nlabor matters. Where labor and management agree on\nunionization, there is no conflict.\n                             II\n  I turn now to the statute\u2019s compliance provisions. They\n6       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrequire grant recipients to maintain \u201crecords sufficient to\nshow that no state funds were used\u201d for prohibited expen-\nditures; they deter the use of commingled funds for prohib-\nited expenditures; and they impose serious penalties upon\nviolators. Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a716645.2(c), 16645.7(b)\u2013\n(c). The majority seems to rest its conclusions in part\nupon its belief that these requirements are too strict, that,\nunder the guise of neutral enforcement, they discourage\nthe use of nonstate money to engage in free debate on\nlabor/management issues. Ante, at 10\u201311.\n   I agree with the majority that, should the compliance\nprovisions, as a practical matter, unreasonably discourage\nexpenditure of nonstate funds, the NLRA may well pre-\nempt California\u2019s statute. But I cannot say on the basis of\nthe record before us that the statute will have that effect.\n   The language of the statute is clear. The statute re-\nquires recipients of state money to \u201cmaintain records\nsufficient to show that no state funds were used\u201d for pro-\nhibited expenditures. \u00a7\u00a716645.2, 16645.7(c). And the\nclass of prohibited expenditures is quite broad: It covers\n\u201cany expense\u201d incurred in \u201cany attempt\u201d by an employer to\n\u201cinfluence the decision of its employees,\u201d including \u201clegal\nand consulting fees and salaries of supervisors and em-\nployees\u201d incurred during research for or the preparation,\nplanning, coordination, or execution of activities to \u201cassist,\npromote, or deter\u201d union organizing. \u00a716646(a) (emphasis\nadded). And where an employer mingles state funds and\nnon-state funds, (say, to pay a particular employee who\nspends part of her time dealing with unionization matters)\nthe employer must determine \u201con a pro rata basis,\u201d the\nportion of the labor-related expenditure paid for by state\nfunds, and maintain sufficient supporting documentation.\n\u00a716646(b). Any violation of these provisions is then sub-\nject to strict penalties, including treble damages and\nattorney\u2019s fees and costs. \u00a716645.8.\n   What is less clear is the degree to which these provi-\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)             7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsions actually will deter a recipient of state funds from\nusing non-state funds to engage in unionization matters.\nAnd no lower court has ruled on this matter. In the Dis-\ntrict Court, the Chamber of Commerce moved for sum-\nmary judgment arguing that the statute, by placing re-\nstrictions on state funds, was pre-empted by Machinists\nand Garmon and also arguing that the compliance provi-\nsions are so burdensome that they would chill even private\nexpenditures. California opposed the motion. And Cali-\nfornia submitted expert evidence designed to show that its\n\u201caccounting and recordkeeping requirements . . . are simi-\nlar to requirements imposed in other contexts,\u201d are \u201csig-\nnificantly less burdensome than the detailed requirements\nfor federal grant recipients,\u201d and allow \u201cflexibility in estab-\nlishing proper accounting procedures and controls.\u201d App.\n282\u2013283.\n   The District Court granted the Chamber of Commerce\u2019s\nmotion for summary judgment in part, finding that the\noperative sections of the statute were pre-empted for the\nreasons I have discussed in Part I, namely, that the opera-\ntive provisions interfered with the NLRA\u2019s policy of en-\ncouraging \u201cfree debate.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567042\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567042/chamber-of-commerce-of-us-v-lockyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1204 (CD\nCal. 2002). But in doing so, it did not address the Cham-\nber of Commerce\u2019s argument that the California statute\u2019s\ncompliance provisions affected non-state-funded speech to\nthe point that the NLRA pre-empted the statute. Neither\ndid the Court of Appeals address the question whether the\ncompliance provisions themselves constitute sufficient\ngrounds for finding the statute pre-empted.\n   I do not believe that we can, and I would not, decide this\nquestion until the lower courts have had an opportunity to\nconsider and rule upon the compliance-related questions.\nAccordingly, I would vote to vacate the judgment of the\nNinth Circuit and remand for further proceedings on this\nissue.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
