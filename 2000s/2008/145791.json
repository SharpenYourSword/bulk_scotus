Respondent Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., was granted an exemption for assets transferred after it had filed for bankruptcy but before its Chapter 11 plan <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2330</span> was submitted to, and confirmed by, the Bankruptcy Court. Petitioner, the Florida Department of Revenue, seeks reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding the exemption for Piccadilly's asset transfer. Because we hold that \u00a7 1146(a)'s stamp-tax exemption does not apply to transfers made before a plan is confirmed under Chapter 11, we reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Piccadilly was founded in 1944 and was one of the Nation's most successful cafeteria chains until it began experiencing financial difficulties in the last decade. On October 29, 2003, Piccadilly declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, \u00a7 1101 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. V), and requested court authorization to sell substantially all its assets outside the ordinary course of business pursuant to \u00a7 363(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Piccadilly prepared to sell its assets as a going concern and sought an exemption from any stamp taxes on the eventual transfer under \u00a7 1146(a) of the Code.<sup>[1]</sup> The Bankruptcy Court conducted an auction in which the winning bidder agreed to purchase Piccadilly's assets for $80 million.</p>\n<p>On January 26, 2004, as a precondition to the sale, Piccadilly entered into a global settlement agreement with committees of senior secured noteholders and unsecured creditors. The settlement agreement dictated the priority of distribution of the sale proceeds among Piccadilly's creditors. On February 13, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court approved the proposed sale and settlement agreement. The court also ruled that the transfer of assets was exempt from stamp taxes under \u00a7 1146(a). The sale closed on March 16, 2004.</p>\n<p>Piccadilly filed its initial Chapter 11 plan in the Bankruptcy Court on March 26, 2004, and filed an amended plan on July 31, 2004.<sup>[2]</sup> The plan provided for distribution of the sale proceeds in a manner consistent with the settlement agreement. Before the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the plan, Florida filed an objection, seeking a declaration that the $39,200 in stamp taxes it had assessed on certain of Piccadilly's transferred assets fell outside \u00a7 1146(a)'s exemption because the transfer had not been \"under a plan confirmed\" under Chapter 11. On October 21, 2004, the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan. On cross-motions for summary judgment on the stamp-tax issue, the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment in favor <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2331</span> of Piccadilly, reasoning that the sale of substantially all Piccadilly's assets was a transfer \"`under'\" its confirmed plan because the sale was necessary to consummate the plan. App. D to Pet. for Cert. 40a-41a. The District Court upheld the decision on the ground that \u00a7 1146(a), in certain circumstances, affords a stamp-tax exemption even when a transfer occurs prior to confirmation. <i>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.,</i> 379 B.R. 215, 226 (S.D.Fla.2006).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that \"\u00a7 1146[(a)]'s tax exemption may apply to <i>those</i> pre-confirmation transfers that are necessary to the consummation of a confirmed plan of reorganization, which, at the very least, requires that there be some nexus between the pre-confirmation transfer and the confirmed plan.\" <i>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.,</i> 484 F.3d 1299, 1304 (2007) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Finding the statutory text ambiguous, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u00a7 1146(a) should be interpreted consistent with \"the principle that a remedial statute such as the Bankruptcy Code should be liberally construed.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The court further noted that its interpretation of \u00a7 1146(a) better accounted for \"the practical realities of Chapter 11 reorganization cases\" because a debtor may need to transfer assets to induce relevant parties to endorse the proposed confirmation of a plan. <i>Ibid.</i> The Court of Appeals acknowledged that its holding conflicted with the approach taken by the Courts of Appeals for the Third and Fourth Circuits, <i>id.,</i> at 1302, which have held that \u00a7 1146(a) \"does not apply to ... transactions that occur prior to the confirmation of a plan under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\" <i>In re Hechinger Inv. Co. of Del.,</i> 335 F.3d 243, 246 (C.A.3 2003); see also <i>In re NVR, LP,</i> 189 F.3d 442, 458 (C.A.4 1999) (holding that \u00a7 1146(a) \"appl[ies] only to transfers under the Plan occurring after the date of confirmation\").</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 741, 169 L.Ed.2d 579 (2007), to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to whether \u00a7 1146(a) applies to preconfirmation transfers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Section 1146(a), entitled \"Special tax provisions,\" provides: \"The issuance, transfer, or exchange of a security, or the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer <i>under a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title,</i> may not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.\" (Emphasis added.) Florida asserts that \u00a7 1146(a) applies only to postconfirmation sales; Piccadilly contends that it extends to preconfirmation transfers as long as they are made in accordance with a plan that is eventually confirmed. Florida and Piccadilly base their competing readings of \u00a7 1146(a) on the provision's text, on inferences drawn from other Code provisions, and on substantive canons of statutory construction. We consider each of their arguments in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Florida contends that \u00a7 1146(a)'s text unambiguously limits stamp-tax exemptions to postconfirmation transfers made under the authority of a confirmed plan. It observes that the word \"confirmed\" modifies the word \"plan\" and is a past participle, <i>i.e.,</i> \"[a] verb form indicating past or completed action or time that is used as a verbal adjective in phrases such as <i>baked beans</i> and <i>finished work.\"</i> American Heritage Dictionary 1287 (4th ed.2000). Florida maintains that a past participle indicates past or completed action even when it is placed after the noun it modifies, as in \"beans baked in the oven,\" or \"work finished after midnight.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2332</span> Thus, it argues, the phrase \"plan confirmed\" denotes a \"confirmed plan\"\u0097 meaning one that has been confirmed in the past.</p>\n<p>Florida further contends that the word \"under\" in \"under a plan confirmed\" should be read to mean \"with the authorization of\" or \"inferior or subordinate\" to its referent, here the confirmed plan. See <i>Ardestani v. INS,</i> 502 U.S. 129, 135, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991) (noting that a thing that is \"`under'\" a statute is most naturally read as being \"`subject to'\" or \"`governed by'\" the statute). Florida points out that, in the other two appearances of \"under\" in \u00a7 1146(a), it clearly means \"subject to.\" Invoking the textual canon that \"`identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,'\" <i>Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc.,</i> 508 U.S. 152, 159, 113 S.Ct. 2006, 124 L.Ed.2d 71 (1993), Florida asserts the term must also have its core meaning of \"subject to\" in the phrase \"under a plan confirmed.\" Florida thus reasons that to be eligible for \u00a7 1146(a)'s exemption, a transfer must be subject to a plan that has been confirmed subject to \u00a7 1129 (2000 ed. and Supp. V). Echoing the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in <i>NVR, supra,</i> at 457, Florida concludes that a transfer made prior to the date of plan confirmation cannot be subject to, or under the authority of, something that did not exist at the time of the transfer\u0097a confirmed plan.</p>\n<p>Piccadilly counters that the statutory language does not unambiguously impose a temporal requirement. It contends that \"plan confirmed\" is not necessarily the equivalent of \"confirmed plan,\" and that had Congress intended the latter, it would have used that language, as it did in a related Code provision. See \u00a7 1142(b) (referring to \"any instrument required to effect a transfer of property dealt with by a confirmed plan\"). Piccadilly also argues that \"under\" is just as easily read to mean \"in accordance with.\" It observes that the variability of the term \"under\" is well-documented, noting that the American Heritage Dictionary 1395 (1976) provides 15 definitions, including \"[i]n view of,\" \"because of,\" \"by virtue of,\" as well as \"[s]ubject to the restraint ... of.\" See also <i>Ardestani, supra,</i> at 135, 112 S.Ct. 515 (recognizing that \"[t]he word `under' has many dictionary definitions and must draw its meaning from its context\"). Although \"under\" appears several times in \u00a7 1146(a), Piccadilly maintains there is no reason why a term of such common usage and variable meaning must have the same meaning each time it is used, even in the same sentence. As an illustration, it points to \u00a7 302(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which states, \"The commencement of a joint case under a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief under such chapter.\" Piccadilly contends that this provision is best read as: \"The commencement of a joint case <i>subject to the provisions of</i> a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief <i>in</i> such chapter.\" Piccadilly thus concludes that the statutory text\u0097standing alone\u0097is susceptible of more than one interpretation. See <i>Hechinger, supra,</i> at 253 (\"[W]e cannot say that the language of [\u00a7 1146(a)] rules out the possibility that `under a plan confirmed' means `in agreement with a plan confirmed'\").</p>\n<p>While both sides present credible interpretations of \u00a7 1146(a), Florida has the better one. To be sure, Congress could have used more precise language\u0097 <i>i.e.,</i> \"under a plan <i>that has been</i> confirmed\"\u0097and thus removed all ambiguity. But the two readings of the language that Congress chose are not equally plausible: Of the two, Florida's is clearly the more natural. The interpretation advanced by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2333</span> Piccadilly and adopted by the Eleventh Circuit\u0097that there must be \"some nexus between the pre-confirmation transfer and the confirmed plan\" for \u00a7 1146(a) to apply, 484 F.3d, at 1304\u0097places greater strain on the statutory text than the simpler construction advanced by Florida and adopted by the Third and Fourth Circuits.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Piccadilly's emphasis on the distinction between \"plan confirmed\" and \"confirmed plan\" is unavailing because \u00a7 1146(a) specifies not only that a tax-exempt transfer be \"under a plan,\" but also that the plan in question be confirmed pursuant to \u00a71129. Congress' placement of \"plan confirmed\" before \"under section 1129\" avoids the ambiguity that would have arisen had it used the term \"confirmed plan,\" which could easily be read to mean that the transfer must be \"under section 1129\" rather than under a plan that was itself confirmed under \u00a7 1129.</p>\n<p>Although we agree with Florida that the more natural reading of \u00a7 1146(a) is that the exemption applies only to postconfirmation transfers, ultimately we need not decide whether the statute is unambiguous on its face. Even assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the language of \u00a7 1146(a) is facially ambiguous, the ambiguity must be resolved in Florida's favor. We reach this conclusion after considering the parties' other arguments, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Piccadilly insists that, whatever the degree of ambiguity on its face, \u00a7 1146(a) becomes even more ambiguous when read in context with other Bankruptcy Code provisions. Piccadilly asserts that if Congress had intended \u00a7 1146(a) to apply exclusively to transfers occurring after confirmation, it would have made its intent plain with an express temporal limitation similar to those appearing elsewhere in the Code. For example, \u00a7 1127 governs modifications to a Chapter 11 plan, providing that the proponent of a plan may modify the plan \"at any time before confirmation,\" or, subject to certain restrictions, \"at any time after confirmation of such plan.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1127(a)-(b). Similar examples abound. See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1104(a) (\"[a]t any time after the commencement of the case but before confirmation of a plan ...\"); \u00a7 1104(c) (\"[a]t any time before the confirmation of a plan ...\"). Piccadilly emphasizes that, \"where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\" <i>Russello v. United States,</i> 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Congress did not impose a clear and commonly used temporal limitation in \u00a7 1146(a), Piccadilly concludes that Congress did not intend one to exist. Piccadilly buttresses its conclusion by pointing out that \u00a7 1146(b)\u0097the subsection immediately following \u00a7 1146(a)\u0097includes an express temporal limitation. See \u00a7 1146(b) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (providing that a bankruptcy court may declare certain tax consequences after the date a government unit responds to a plan proponent's request or \"270 days after such request,\" whichever is earlier). But Congress included no such limitation in subsection (a).</p>\n<p>Piccadilly also relies on other Code provisions to bolster its argument that the term \"under\" preceding \"a plan confirmed\" in \u00a7 1146(a) should be read broadly\u0097to mean \"in accordance with\" rather than the narrower \"authorized by.\" Apart from \u00a7 302, discussed above, Piccadilly adverts to \u00a7 111, which states that an agency providing credit counseling to debtors is required to meet \"the standards set forth under this section.\" \u00a7 111(b)(4)(A) (2000 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2334</span> ed., Supp. V). Piccadilly argues that this language requires the agency to meet \"the standards set forth <i>in</i> this section,\" because reading the quoted language to mean \"the standards set forth <i>authorized by</i> this section\" would render the words \"set forth\" nonsensical. Piccadilly additionally refers to \u00a7 303(a), which provides that \"[a]n involuntary case may be commenced only under chapter 7 or 11 of this title.\" Again, Piccadilly asserts that this language means \"an involuntary case may be commenced only <i>in</i> chapter 7 or 11 of this title.\" It reasons that \"under\" in \u00a7 303(a) cannot mean \"authorized by\" because \u00a7 303(a) itself authorizes involuntary cases, and the provisions of Chapters 7 and 11 do not. Piccadilly makes a similar argument with respect to \u00a7 343, which provides that \"[t]he debtor shall appear and submit to examination under oath at the meeting of creditors.\" Reading \"under\" to mean \"authorized by\" would make little sense here. On the basis of these examples, Piccadilly concludes that the term \"under\" is ambiguous.</p>\n<p>Finally, Piccadilly maintains that \"under\" in \u00a7 1146(a) should be construed broadly in light of \u00a7 365(g)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides that rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease constitutes the equivalent of a prebankruptcy breach \"if such contract or lease has not been assumed under this section or under a plan confirmed under chapter ... 11.\" In <i>Hechinger,</i> the Third Circuit concluded that substituting \"authorized by\" for \"under\" in \u00a7 1146(a) would be consistent with the use of the parallel language in \u00a7 365(g)(1). 335 F.3d, at 254. Piccadilly attempts to refute <i>Hechinger's</i> reading of \u00a7 365(g)(1), asserting that, because authorization for the assumption of a lease under a plan is described in \u00a7 1123(b)(2), which \"circles back to section 365,\" such authorization cannot be \"subject to\" or \"authorized by\" Chapter 11. Brief for Respondent 39 (emphasis deleted); see 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1123(b)(2) (providing that \"a plan may ... subject to section 365 of this title, provide for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor not previously rejected under such section\"). The phrase \"under a plan confirmed\" in \u00a7 365(g)(1), contends Piccadilly, is thus best read to mean \"<i>in accordance with</i> a plan confirmed\" because a plan may provide for the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease but not\u0097unlike \u00a7 365\u0097be the ultimate authority for that assumption. As a result, Piccadilly concludes that the identical language of \u00a7 1146(a) should have the same meaning.</p>\n<p>Piccadilly supports this point with its assertion that, unlike sales, postconfirmation assumptions or rejections are not permitted under the Bankruptcy Code. See <i>NLRB v. Bildisco &amp; Bildisco,</i> 465 U.S. 513, 529, 104 S.Ct. 1188, 79 L.Ed.2d 482 (1984) (stating that in \"a Chapter 11 reorganization, a debtor-in-possession has until a reorganization plan is confirmed to decide whether to accept or reject an executory contract\"). Because, as Piccadilly contends, the phrase \"under a plan confirmed under chapter ... 11\" in \u00a7 365(g)(1) cannot refer to assumptions or rejections occurring after confirmation, it would be anomalous to read the identical phrase in \u00a7 1146(a) to cover <i>only</i> postconfirmation transfers.</p>\n<p>For its part, Florida argues that the statutory context of \u00a7 1146(a) supports its position that the stamp-tax exemption applies exclusively to postconfirmation transfers. It observes that the subchapter in which \u00a7 1146(a) appears is entitled, \"POSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS.\" Florida contends that, while not dispositive, the placement of a provision in a particular subchapter suggests that its terms should be interpreted consistent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2335</span> with that subchapter. See <i>Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury,</i> 489 U.S. 803, 809, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989) (\"It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme\"). In addition, Florida dismisses Piccadilly's references to the temporal limitations in other Code provisions on the ground that it would have been superfluous for Congress to add any further limitations to \u00a7 1146(a)'s already unambiguous temporal element.</p>\n<p>Even on the assumption that the text of \u00a7 1146(a) is ambiguous, we are not persuaded by Piccadilly's contextual arguments. As noted above, Congress could have used language that made \u00a7 1146(a)'s temporal element clear beyond question. Unlike \u00a7 1146(a), however, the temporal language examples quoted by Piccadilly are indispensable to the operative meaning of the provisions in which they appear. Piccadilly's reliance on \u00a7 1127, for example, is misplaced because that section explicitly differentiates between preconfirmation modifications, see \u00a7 1127(a), and postconfirmation modifications, which are permissible \"only if circumstances warrant\" them, \u00a7 1127(b). It was unnecessary for Congress to include in \u00a7 1146(a) a phrase such as \"at any time after confirmation of such plan\" because the phrase \"under a plan confirmed\" is most naturally read to require that there be a confirmed plan at the time of the transfer.</p>\n<p>Even if we were to adopt Piccadilly's broad definition of \"under,\" its interpretation of the statute faces other obstacles. The asset transfer here can hardly be said to have been consummated \"in accordance with\" any confirmed plan because, as of the closing date, Piccadilly had not even submitted its plan to the Bankruptcy Court for confirmation. Piccadilly's asset sale was thus not conducted \"in accordance with\" any plan confirmed under Chapter 11. Rather, it was conducted \"in accordance with\" the procedures set forth in Chapter 3\u0097specifically, \u00a7 363(b)(1). To read the statute as Piccadilly proposes would make \u00a7 1146(a)'s exemption turn on whether a debtor-in-possession's actions are consistent with a legal instrument that does not exist\u0097and indeed may not even be conceived of\u0097at the time of the sale. Reading \u00a7 1146(a) in context with other relevant Code provisions, we find nothing justifying such a curious interpretation of what is a straightforward exemption.</p>\n<p>Nor does anything in \u00a7 365(g)(1) recommend Piccadilly's reading of \u00a7 1146(a). Section 365(g) generally allows a trustee to reject \"an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,\" <i>i.e.,</i> to reject a contract that is unfavorable to the estate, subject to court approval. As the text makes clear, such approval may occur either under \"this section,\" \u00a7 365(g)\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> \"at any time before the confirmation of a plan,\" \u00a7 365(d)(2)\u0097or \"under a plan confirmed under chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13,\" \u00a7 365(g)(1). Piccadilly relies heavily on <i>Bildisco, supra,</i> in which this Court held that \u00a7 365 permits a debtor-in-possession to reject a collective-bargaining agreement like any other executory contract, and that doing so is not an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act. In reaching this conclusion, the Court observed that \"a debtor-in-possession has until a reorganization plan is confirmed <i>to decide</i> whether to accept or reject an executory contract.\" 465 U.S., at 529, 104 S.Ct. 1188 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>We agree with <i>Bildisco's</i> commonsense observation that the <i>decision</i> whether to reject a contract or lease must be made before confirmation. But that in no way undermines the fact that the rejection takes <i>effect</i> upon or after confirmation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2336</span> of the Chapter 11 plan (or before confirmation if pursuant to \u00a7 365(d)(2)). In the context of \u00a7 1146(a), the decision whether to transfer a given asset \"under a plan confirmed\" must be made prior to submitting the Chapter 11 plan to the bankruptcy court, but the transfer itself cannot be \"under a plan confirmed\" until the court confirms the plan in question. Only at that point does the transfer become eligible for the stamp-tax exemption.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>If the statutory context suggests anything, it is that \u00a7 1146(a) is inapplicable to preconfirmation transfers. We find it informative that Congress placed \u00a7 1146(a) in a subchapter entitled, \"POSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS.\" To be sure, a subchapter heading cannot substitute for the operative text of the statute. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey,</i> 524 U.S. 206, 212, 118 S.Ct. 1952, 141 L.Ed.2d 215 (1998) (\"`[T]he title of a statute ... cannot limit the plain meaning of the text'\"). Nonetheless, statutory titles and section headings \"`are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.'\" <i>Porter v. Nussle,</i> 534 U.S. 516, 528, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002). The placement of \u00a7 1146(a) within a subchapter expressly limited to postconfirmation matters undermines Piccadilly's view that \u00a7 1146(a) covers preconfirmation transfers.</p>\n<p>But even if we were fully to accept Piccadilly's textual and contextual arguments, they would establish at most that the statutory language is ambiguous. They do not\u0097and largely are not intended to\u0097demonstrate that \u00a7 1146(a)'s purported ambiguity should be resolved in Piccadilly's favor. Florida argues that various nontextual canons of construction require us to resolve any ambiguity in its favor. Piccadilly responds with substantive canons of its own. It is to these dueling canons of construction that we now turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Florida contends that even if the statutory text is deemed ambiguous, applicable substantive canons compel its interpretation of \u00a7 1146(a). Florida first invokes the canon that \"Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it reenacts a statute without change.\" <i>Lorillard v. Pons,</i> 434 U.S. 575, 580-581, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978). Florida observes that the relevant language of \u00a7 1146(a) relating to \"under a plan confirmed\" has remained unchanged since 1978 despite several revisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The most recent revision in 2005 occurred after the Fourth Circuit's decision in <i>NVR</i> and the Third Circuit's decision in <i>Hechinger</i> but before the Eleventh Circuit's decision below. Florida asserts that Congress ratified this longstanding interpretation when, in its most recent amendments to the Code, it \"readopted\" the stamp-tax provision verbatim as \u00a7 1146(a). Brief for Petitioner 26.</p>\n<p>Florida also invokes the substantive canon\u0097on which the Third Circuit relied in <i>Hechinger</i>\u0097that courts should \"`proceed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2337</span> carefully when asked to recognize an exemption from state taxation that Congress has not clearly expressed.'\" 335 F.3d, at 254 (quoting <i>California State Bd. of Equalization v. Sierra Summit, Inc.,</i> 490 U.S. 844, 851-852, 109 S.Ct. 2228, 104 L.Ed.2d 910 (1989)). In light of this directive, Florida contends that \u00a7 1146(a)'s language must be construed strictly in favor of the States to prevent unwarranted displacement of their tax laws. See <i>National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n,</i> 515 U.S. 582, 590, 115 S.Ct. 2351, 132 L.Ed.2d 509 (1995) (discussing principles of comity in taxation and the \"federal reluctance to interfere with state taxation\" given the \"strong background presumption against interference\").</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Florida notes that the canon also discourages federal interference with the administration of a State's taxation scheme. See <i>id.,</i> at 586, 590, 115 S.Ct. 2351. Florida contends that the Court of Appeals' extension of \u00a7 1146(a) to preconfirmation transfers directly interferes with the administration of the State's stamp tax, which is imposed \"prior to recordation\" of the instrument of transfer. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 201.01, 201.02(1) (2006). Extending the exemption to transfers that occurred months or years before a confirmable plan even existed, Florida explains, may require the States to \"`unravel'\" stamp taxes already collected. Brief for Petitioner 31. Alternatively, should a court grant an exemption under \u00a7 1146(a) before confirmation, States would be saddled with the task of monitoring whether the plan is ever eventually confirmed.</p>\n<p>In response, Piccadilly contends that the federalism principle articulated in <i>Sierra Summit, supra,</i> at 852, 109 S.Ct. 2228, does not apply where there is a \"clear expression of an exemption from state taxation\" overriding a State's authority to tax. In Piccadilly's view, that is precisely the case with regard to \u00a7 1146(a), which proscribes the imposition of stamp taxes and demonstrates Congress' intent to exempt a category of state taxation.</p>\n<p>Piccadilly further maintains that Florida's stamp tax is nothing more than a postpetition claim, specifically an administrative expense, which is paid as a priority claim ahead of the prepetition claims of most creditors. Equating Florida's receipt of tax revenue with a preference in favor of a particular claimant, Piccadilly argues that \u00a7 1146(a)'s ambiguous exemption should not be construed to diminish other claimants' recoveries. See <i>Howard Delivery Service, Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co.,</i> 547 U.S. 651, 667, 126 S.Ct. 2105, 165 L.Ed.2d 110 (2006) (emphasizing that \"provisions allowing preferences must be tightly construed\"). Reading the stamp-tax exemption too narrowly, Piccadilly maintains, \"`is not only inconsistent with the policy of equality of distribution'\" but also \"`dilutes the value of the priority for those creditors Congress intended to prefer'\"\u0097those with prepetition claims. Brief for Respondent 54 (quoting <i>Howard Delivery Serv., supra,</i> at 667, 126 S.Ct. 2105).</p>\n<p>Above all, Piccadilly urges us to adopt the Court of Appeals' maxim that \"a remedial statute such as the Bankruptcy Code should be liberally construed.\" 484 F.3d, at 1304; cf. <i>Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson,</i> 343 U.S. 779, 782, 72 S.Ct. 1011, 96 L.Ed. 1294 (1952). In Piccadilly's view, any ambiguity in the statutory text is overshadowed by \u00a7 1146(a)'s obvious purpose: to facilitate the Chapter 11 process \"through giving tax relief.\" <i>In re Jacoby-Bender, Inc.,</i> 758 F.2d 840, 841 (C.A.2 1985). Piccadilly characterizes the tax on asset transfers at issue here as tantamount to a levy on the bankruptcy process itself. A stamp tax like Florida's makes the sale of a debtor's property more expensive and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2338</span> reduces the total proceeds available to satisfy the creditors' claims, contrary to Congress' clear intent in enacting \u00a7 1146(a).</p>\n<p>What is unclear, Piccadilly argues, is why \"Congress would have intended the anomaly that a transfer essential to a plan that occurs two minutes before confirmation may be taxed, but the same transfer occurring two seconds after may not.\" Brief for Respondent 43. After all, interpreting \u00a7 1146(a) in the manner Florida proposes would lead precisely to that result. And that, Piccadilly asserts, is \"absurd\" in light of \u00a7 1146(a)'s policy aim\u0097 evidenced by the provision's text and legislative history\u0097of reducing the cost of asset transfers. In that vein, Piccadilly contends that interpreting \u00a7 1146(a) to apply solely to postconfirmation transfers would undermine Chapter 11's twin objectives of \"preserving going concerns and maximizing property available to satisfy creditors.\" <i>Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn. v. 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership,</i> 526 U.S. 434, 453, 119 S.Ct. 1411, 143 L.Ed.2d 607 (1999). In order to obtain the maximum value for its assets\u0097especially assets rapidly declining in value\u0097Piccadilly claims that a debtor often must close the sale before formal confirmation of the Chapter 11 plan.</p>\n<p>We agree with Florida that the federalism canon articulated in <i>Sierra Summit</i> and elsewhere obliges us to construe \u00a7 1146(a)'s exemption narrowly. Piccadilly's effort to evade the canon falls well short of the mark because reading \u00a7 1146(a) in the manner Piccadilly proposes would require us to do exactly what the canon counsels against. If we recognized an exemption for preconfirmation transfers, we would in effect be \"`recogniz[ing] an exemption from state taxation that <i>Congress has not clearly expressed</i>'\"\u0097namely, an exemption for preconfirmation transfers. <i>Sierra Summit,</i> 490 U.S., at 851-852, 109 S.Ct. 2228 (emphasis added); see also <i>Swarts v. Hammer,</i> 194 U.S. 441, 444, 24 S.Ct. 695, 48 L.Ed. 1060 (1904) (reasoning that if Congress endeavored to exempt a debtor from state and local taxation, \"the intention would be clearly expressed, not left to be collected or inferred from disputable considerations of convenience in administering the estate of the bankrupt\"). Indeed, Piccadilly proves precisely this point by resting its entire case on the premise that Congress has expressed its stamp-tax exemption in ambiguous language. Therefore, far from being inapposite, the canon is decisive in this case.</p>\n<p>The canons on which Piccadilly relies are inapposite. While we agree with Piccadilly that \"provisions allowing preferences must be tightly construed,\" <i>Howard Delivery Serv., supra,</i> at 667, 126 S.Ct. 2105, \u00a7 1146(a) is not a preference-granting provision. The statutory text makes no mention of preferences.</p>\n<p>Nor are we persuaded that in this case we should construe \u00a7 1146(a) \"liberally\" to serve its ostensibly \"remedial\" purpose. Based on the Eleventh Circuit's declaration that the Bankruptcy Code is a \"remedial statute,\" Piccadilly would stretch the disallowance well beyond what the statutory text can naturally bear. Apart from the opinion below, however, the only authority Piccadilly offers is a 1952 decision of this Court interpreting the Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872. See Brief for Respondent 54 (citing <i>Isbrandtsen, supra,</i> at 782, 72 S.Ct. 1011). But unlike the statutory scheme in <i>Isbrandtsen,</i> which was \"`designed to secure the comfort and health of seamen aboard ship, hospitalization at home and care abroad,'\" 343 U.S., at 784, 72 S.Ct. 1011 (quoting <i>Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co. of N. J.,</i> 318 U.S. 724, 728, 63 S.Ct. 930, 87 L.Ed. 1107 (1943)), the Bankruptcy Code\u0097and Chapter 11 in particular\u0097is not a remedial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2339</span> statute in that sense. To the contrary, this Court has rejected the notion that \"Congress had a single purpose in enacting Chapter 11.\" <i>Toibb v. Radloff,</i> 501 U.S. 157, 163, 111 S.Ct. 2197, 115 L.Ed.2d 145 (1991). Rather, Chapter 11 strikes a balance between a debtor's interest in reorganizing and restructuring its debts and the creditors' interest in maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate. <i>Ibid.</i> The Code also accommodates the interests of the States in regulating property transfers by \"`generally [leaving] the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt's estate to state law.'\" <i>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co.,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1199, 1205, 167 L.Ed.2d 178 (2007). Such interests often do not coincide, and in this case, they clearly do not. We therefore decline to construe the exemption granted by \u00a7 1146(a) to the detriment of the State.</p>\n<p>As for Piccadilly's assertion that reading \u00a7 1146(a) to allow preconfirmation transfers to be taxed while exempting others moments later would amount to an \"absurd\" policy, we reiterate that \"`it is not for us to substitute our view of ... policy for the legislation which has been passed by Congress.'\" <i>Hechinger,</i> 335 F.3d, at 256. That said, we see no absurdity in reading \u00a7 1146(a) as setting forth a simple, bright-line rule instead of the complex, after-the-fact inquiry Piccadilly envisions. At bottom, we agree with the Fourth Circuit's summation of \u00a7 1146(a):</p>\n<blockquote>\"Congress struck a most reasonable balance. If a debtor is able to develop a Chapter 11 reorganization and obtain confirmation, then the debtor is to be afforded relief from certain taxation to facilitate the implementation of the reorganization plan. Before a debtor reaches this point, however, the state and local tax systems may not be subjected to federal interference.\" <i>NVR,</i> 189 F.3d, at 458.</blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, to the extent the \"practical realities\" of Chapter 11 reorganizations are increasingly rendering postconfirmation transfers a thing of the past, see 484 F.3d, at 1304, it is incumbent upon the Legislature, and not the Judiciary, to determine whether \u00a7 1146(a) is in need of revision. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 831, 841, 169 L.Ed.2d 680 (2008) (\"We are not at liberty to rewrite the statute to reflect a meaning we deem more desirable\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The most natural reading of \u00a7 1146(a)'s text, the provision's placement within the Code, and applicable substantive canons all lead to the same conclusion: Section 1146(a) affords a stamp-tax exemption only to transfers made pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan that has been confirmed. Because Piccadilly transferred its assets before its Chapter 11 plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it may not rely on \u00a7 1146(a) to avoid Florida's stamp taxes. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Bankruptcy Code provides that the \"transfer\" of an asset \"<i>under a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title,</i> may not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.\" 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1146(a) (2000 ed., Supp V) (previously \u00a7 1146(c)) (emphasis added). In this case, the debtor's reorganization \"plan\" provides for the \"transfer\" of assets. But the \"plan\" itself was not \"confirmed under section 1129 of this title\" (<i>i.e.,</i> the Bankruptcy Judge did not formally approve the plan) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2340</span> until <i>after</i> the \"transfer\" of assets took place. See \u00a7 1129 (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (detailing the requirements for bankruptcy court approval of a Chapter 11 plan).</p>\n<p>Hence we must ask whether the time of transfer matters. Do the statutory words \"under a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title\" apply only where a transfer takes place \"under a plan\" that at the time of the transfer <i>already has been</i> \"confirmed under section 1129 of this title\"? Or, do they also apply where a transfer takes place \"under a plan\" that <i>subsequently is</i> \"confirmed under section 1129 of this title\"? The Court concludes that the statutory phrase applies only where a transfer takes place \"under a plan\" that at the time of transfer <i>already has been</i> \"confirmed under section 1129 of this title.\" In my view, however, the statutory phrase applies \"under a plan\" that at the time of transfer either <i>already has been</i> or <i>subsequently is</i> \"confirmed.\" In a word, the majority believes that the time (pre- or post-transfer) at which the bankruptcy judge confirms the reorganization plan matters. I believe that it does not. (And construing the provision to refer to a plan that simply \"is\" confirmed would require us to read fewer words into the statute than the Court's construction, which reads the provision to refer only to a plan \"that has been\" confirmed, <i>ante,</i> at 2339.)</p>\n<p>The statutory language itself is perfectly ambiguous on the point. Linguistically speaking, it is no more difficult to apply the words \"plan confirmed\" to instances in which the \"plan\" <i>subsequently is</i> \"confirmed\" than to restrict their application to instances in which the \"plan\" <i>already has been</i> \"confirmed.\" See <i>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.,</i> 484 F.3d 1299, 1304 (C.A.11 2007) <i>(per curiam)</i> (\"[T]he statute can plausibly be read either as describing eligible transfers to include transfers `under a plan confirmed' regardless of <i>when</i> the plan is confirmed, <i>or</i> ... imposing a temporal restriction on when the confirmation of the plan must occur\" (emphasis in original)). Cf. <i>In re Hechinger Inv. Co. of Del.,</i> 335 F.3d 243, 252-253 (C.A.3 2003) (majority opinion of Alito, J.) (noting more than one \"plausible interpretation\"); <i>In re NVR, LP,</i> 189 F.3d 442, 458 (C.A.4 1999) (Wilkinson, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"equally possible that the provision requires only that the transfer occur `under'\u0097i.e., that it be inferior or subordinate to\u0097`a plan' that is ultimately `confirmed'\"). But cf. <i>ante,</i> at 2332-2333 (majority believes its reading is \"clearly the more natural\").</p>\n<p>Nor can I find any text-based argument that points clearly in one direction rather than the other. Indeed, the majority, after methodically combing the textualist beaches, finds that a comparison with other somewhat similar phrases in the Bankruptcy Code sheds little light. For example, on the one hand, if Congress thought the time of confirmation mattered, why did it not say so expressly as it has done elsewhere in the Code? See, <i>e.g.,</i> 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127(b) (plan proponent may modify it \"at any time <i>after</i> confirmation\" (emphasis added)); \u00a7 1104(a) (\"[a]t any time after the commencement of the case but <i>before</i> confirmation\" (emphasis added)); \u00a7 1104(c) (\"at any time <i>before</i> the confirmation of a plan\" (emphasis added)); \u00a7 1114(e)(2) (\"<i>before</i> a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title is effective\" (emphasis added)). On the other hand, if Congress thought the time of confirmation did <i>not</i> matter, why did it place this provision in a subchapter entitled \"POSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS\"? See 11 U.S.C., ch. 11, subch. III. (And yet one could also argue that the tax exemption provision appears under the \"postconfirmation matters\" title because the trigger for the exemption is plan confirmation. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2341</span> Thus, the exemption is a \"postconfirmation matter,\" regardless of when the transfer occurs.)</p>\n<p>The canons of interpretation offer little help. And the majority, for the most part, seems to agree. It ultimately rests its interpretive conclusion upon this Court's statement that courts \"must proceed carefully when asked to recognize an exemption from state taxation that Congress has not clearly expressed.\" <i>California State Bd. of Equalization v. Sierra Summit, Inc.,</i> 490 U.S. 844, 851-852, 109 S.Ct. 2228, 104 L.Ed.2d 910 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). See <i>ante,</i> at 2338. But when, as here, we interpret a provision the <i>express point of which</i> is to exempt some category of state taxation, how can the statement in <i>Sierra Summit</i> prove determinative? See \u00a7 1146(a) (\"The issuance, transfer, or exchange of a security, or the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title, <i>may not be taxed</i> under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>Neither does Florida's related claim, protesting federal interference in the <i>administration</i> of a State's taxation scheme seem plausible. See Brief for Petitioner 32-33 (noting the \"additional difficulties and complexities that will proliferate\" under the lower court's decision). <i>If</i> Florida now requires transferees to file a <i>pre-existing</i> confirmed plan in order to avoid payment of the stamp tax, then why could Florida not require a transferee under a not-yet-confirmed plan to pay the stamp tax and then file the plan after its confirmation in order to obtain a refund? (If there is some other, less curable, practical problem, Florida has not explained what it is.) Given these difficulties, I suspect that the majority's reliance upon <i>Sierra Summit</i>'s \"canon,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2336-2337, reflects no more than an effort to find the proverbial \"any port\" in this interpretive storm.</p>\n<p>The absence of a clear answer in text or canons, however, should not lead us to judicial despair. Consistent with Court precedent, we can and should ask a further question: <i>Why</i> would Congress have insisted upon temporal limits? What reasonable <i>purpose</i> might such limits serve? See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Dolan v. Postal Service,</i> 546 U.S. 481, 486, 126 S.Ct. 1252, 163 L.Ed.2d 1079 (2006) (\"Interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, <i>considering the purpose</i> and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis\" (emphasis added)); <i>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> 519 U.S. 337, 346, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997) (the Court's construction of a statute's meaning based in part on its consideration of the statute's <i>\"primary purpose\"</i> (emphasis added)). In fact, the majority's reading of temporal limits in \u00a7 1146(a) serves <i>no reasonable congressional purpose at all.</i></p>\n<p>The statute's purpose is apparent on its face. It seeks to further Chapter 11's basic objectives: (1) \"preserving going concerns\" and (2) \"maximizing property available to satisfy creditors.\" <i>Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn. v. 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership,</i> 526 U.S. 434, 453, 119 S.Ct. 1411, 143 L.Ed.2d 607 (1999). See also <i>Toibb v. Radloff,</i> 501 U.S. 157, 163, 111 S.Ct. 2197, 115 L.Ed.2d 145 (1991) (Chapter 11 \"embodies the general [Bankruptcy] Code policy of maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate\"). As an important bankruptcy treatise notes, \"[i]n addition to tax relief, the purpose of the exemption of [\u00a7 1146(a)] is to encourage and facilitate bankruptcy asset sales.\" 8 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1146.02, p. 1146-3 (15th ed. rev.2005). It furthers these objectives where, <i>e.g.,</i> asset transfers are at issue, by turning over to the estate (for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2342</span> the use of creditors or to facilitate reorganization) funds that otherwise would go to pay state stamp taxes on plan-related transferred assets. The requirement that the transfers take place pursuant to a reorganization \"plan\" that is \"confirmed\" provides the bankruptcy judge's assurance that the transfer meets with creditor approval and the requirements laid out in \u00a7 1129.</p>\n<p>How would the majority's temporal limitation further these statutory objectives? It would not do so in any way. From the perspective of these purposes, it makes no difference whether a transfer takes place before or after the plan is confirmed. In both instances the exemption puts in the hands of the creditors or the estate money that would otherwise go to the State in the form of a stamp tax. In both instances the confirmation of the related plan assures the legitimacy (from bankruptcy law's perspective) of the plan that provides for the assets transfer.</p>\n<p>Moreover, one major reason why a transfer may take place <i>before</i> rather than <i>after</i> a plan is confirmed is that the preconfirmation bankruptcy process takes time. As the Administrative Office of the United States Courts recently reported, \"[a] Chapter 11 case may continue for many years.\" Bankruptcy Basics (Apr. 2006), online at http://www.uscourts.gov/bankruptcycourts/bankruptcybasics/chapter11.html (as visited June 13, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Accord, <i>In re Hechinger Inv. Co. of Del.,</i> 254 B.R. 306, 320 (Bkrtcy.D.Del.2000) (noting it may run \"a year or two\"). And a firm (or its assets) may have more value (say, as a going concern) where sale takes place quickly. As the District Court in this case acknowledged, \"there are times when it is more advantageous for the debtor to begin to sell as many assets as quickly as possible in order to insure that the assets do not lose value.\" <i>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.,</i> 379 B.R. 215, 224 (S.D.Fla.2006) (internal quotations marks and alteration omitted). See, <i>e.g., </i><i>In re Webster Classic Auctions, Inc.,</i> 318 B.R. 216, 219 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Fla.2004) (recognizing \"the inestimable benefit to a Chapter 11 estate to sell a piece of property at the most opportune time\u0097whether pre- or postconfirmation\u0097as opposed to requiring all concerned to wait for a postconfirmation sale in order to receive the tax relief Congress obviously intended\"); <i>In re Medical Software Solutions,</i> 286 B.R. 431, 441 (Bkrtcy.D.Utah 2002) (approving preconfirmation sale of debtor's assets recognizing that the assets' \"value is reducing rapidly\" and there was only a narrow window for a viable sale of the assets). Thus, an immediate sale can often make more revenue available to creditors or for reorganization of the remaining assets. Stamp taxes on related transfers simply reduce the funds available for any such legitimate purposes. And insofar as the Court's interpretation of the statute reduces the funds made available, that interpretation inhibits the statute's efforts to achieve its basic objectives.</p>\n<p>Worse than that, if the potential loss of stamp tax revenue threatens delay in implementing any such decision to sell, then creditors (or the remaining reorganized enterprise) could suffer far more serious harm. They could lose the extra revenues that a speedy sale might otherwise produce. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>In re Met-L-Wood Corp.,</i> 861 F.2d 1012, 1017 (C.A.7 1988) (as suppliers and customers \"shy away,\" it can make sense quickly to sell business to other owners so that it \"can continue\" to operate \"free of the stigma and uncertainty of bankruptcy\"). In the present case, for example, Piccadilly, by selling assets quickly after strategic negotiation, realized $80 million, considerably more than the $54 million originally offered before Piccadilly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2343</span> filed for bankruptcy. That fact, along with the Bankruptcy Court's finding of \"sound business reasons\" for the prompt sale of Piccadilly's assets and that the expeditious sale was \"in the best interests of creditors of [Piccadilly] and other parties in interest,\" App. 32a, suggest that considerably less would have been available for creditors had Piccadilly waited until after the plan's confirmation to execute the sale plan.</p>\n<p>What conceivable reason could Congress have had for silently writing into the statute's language a temporal distinction with such consequences? The majority can find none. It simply says that the result is not \"`absurd'\" and notes the advantages of a \"bright-line rule.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2339. I agree that the majority's interpretation is not absurd and do not dispute the advantages of a clear rule. But I think the statute supplies a clear enough rule\u0097transfers are exempt when there is confirmation and are not exempt when there is no confirmation. And I see no reason to adopt the majority's preferred construction (that only transfers completed after plan confirmation are exempt), where it conflicts with the statute's purpose.</p>\n<p>Of course, we should not substitute \"`\"<i>our view</i> of ... policy\"'\" for the statute that Congress enacted. <i>Ante,</i> at 2339 (emphasis added). But we certainly should consider <i>Congress'</i> view of the policy for the statute it created, and that view inheres in the statute's purpose. \"Statutory interpretation is not a game of blind man's bluff. Judges are free to consider statutory language in light of a statute's basic purposes.\" <i>Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson,</i> 538 U.S. 468, 484, 123 S.Ct. 1655, 155 L.Ed.2d 643 (2003) (BREYER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). It is the majority's failure to work with this important tool of statutory interpretation that has led it to construe the present statute in a way that, in my view, runs contrary to what Congress would have hoped for and expected.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  When litigation commenced in the lower courts, the stamp-tax exemption was contained in \u00a7 1146(c) (2000 ed.). In 2005, Congress repealed subsections (a) and (b), and the stamp-tax exemption was recodified as \u00a7 1146(a). See Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, \u00a7 719(b)(3), 119 Stat. 133. For simplicity, we will cite the provision as it is currently codified.</p>\n<p>[2]  Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings ordinarily culminate in the confirmation of a reorganization plan. But in some cases, as here, a debtor sells all or substantially all its assets under \u00a7 363(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) before seeking or receiving plan confirmation. In this scenario, the debtor typically submits for confirmation a plan of liquidation (rather than a traditional plan of reorganization) providing for the distribution of the proceeds resulting from the sale. Here, Piccadilly filed a Chapter 11 liquidation plan after selling substantially all its assets as a going concern. Although the central purpose of Chapter 11 is to facilitate reorganizations rather than liquidations (covered generally by Chapter 7), Chapter 11 expressly contemplates liquidations. See \u00a7 1129(a)(11) (2000 ed.) (\"Confirmation of the plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganization, of the debtor or any successor to the debtor under the plan, unless such liquidation or reorganization is proposed in the plan\").</p>\n<p>[3]  Also meritless is Piccadilly's argument that \"under\" in the phrase \"under a plan confirmed under chapter ... 11\" in \u00a7 365(g)(1) cannot be read to mean \"subject to\" because \u00a7 1123(b)(2), in Piccadilly's words, \"circles back to section 365.\" Brief for Respondent 39. Section 1123(b)(2) authorizes a plan to provide for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease, but requires that the plan do so in a manner consistent with the various requirements set forth throughout \u00a7 365. By contrast, the phrase \"under this section\" in \u00a7 365(g)(1) serves as a reference to \u00a7 365(d)(2), which permits preconfirmation assumptions and rejections pursuant to a court order (and not, as in \u00a7 1123(b)(2), pursuant to a confirmed plan).</p>\n\n</div>",

PICCA-\n             DILLY CAFETERIAS, INC.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 07\u2013312.      Argued March 26, 2008\u2014Decided June 16, 2008\nAfter respondent (Piccadilly) declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11,\n  but before its plan was submitted to the Bankruptcy Court, that\n  court authorized Piccadilly to sell its assets, approved its settlement\n  agreement with creditors, and granted it an exemption under 11\n  U. S. C. \u00a71146(a), which provides a tax-stamp exemption for any as-\n  set transfer \u201cunder a plan confirmed under section 1129.\u201d After the\n  sale, Piccadilly filed its Chapter 11 plan, but before the plan could be\n  confirmed, petitioner Florida Department of Revenue (Florida) ob-\n  jected, arguing that the stamp taxes it had assessed on certain of the\n  transferred assets fell outside \u00a71146(a)\u2019s exemption because the\n  transfer had not been under a confirmed plan. The court granted\n  Piccadilly summary judgment. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, hold-\n  ing that \u00a71146(a)\u2019s exemption applies to preconfirmation transfers\n  necessary to the consummation of a confirmed Chapter 11 plan, pro-\n  vided there is some nexus between such transfers and the plan; that\n  \u00a71146(a)\u2019s text was ambiguous and should be interpreted consistent\n  with the principle that a remedial statute should be construed liber-\n  ally; and that this interpretation better accounted for the practicali-\n  ties of Chapter 11 cases because a debtor may need to transfer assets\n  to induce relevant parties to endorse a proposed plan\u2019s confirmation.\nHeld: Because \u00a71146(a) affords a stamp-tax exemption only to transfers\n made pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan that has been confirmed, Picca-\n dilly may not rely on that provision to avoid Florida\u2019s stamp taxes.\n The most natural reading of \u00a71146(a)\u2019s text, the provision\u2019s place-\n ment within the Bankruptcy Code, and applicable canons of statutory\n construction lead to this conclusion. Pp. 4\u201319.\n    (a) Florida\u2019s reading of \u00a71146(a) is the most natural. Contending\n2            FLORIDA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. PICCADILLY\n                        CAFETERIAS, INC.\n                             Syllabus\n\n    that the text unambiguously limits stamp-tax exemptions to postcon-\n    firmation transfers made under the authority of a confirmed plan,\n    Florida argues that \u201cplan confirmed\u201d denotes a plan confirmed in the\n    past, and that \u201cunder\u201d should be read to mean \u201cwith the authoriza-\n    tion of\u201d or \u201cinferior or subordinate\u201d to its referent, here the confirmed\n    plan, see Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135. Piccadilly counters\n    that the provision does not unambiguously impose a temporal re-\n    quirement, contending that had Congress intended \u201cplan confirmed\u201d\n    to mean \u201cconfirmed plan,\u201d it would have used that language, and that\n    \u201cunder\u201d is as easily read to mean \u201cin accordance with.\u201d While both\n    sides present credible interpretations, Florida\u2019s is the better one.\n    Congress could have used more precise language and thus removed\n    all ambiguity, but the two readings are not equally plausible. Picca-\n    dilly\u2019s interpretation places greater strain on the statutory text than\n    Florida\u2019s simpler construction. And Piccadilly\u2019s emphasis on the dis-\n    tinction between \u201cplan confirmed\u201d and \u201cconfirmed plan\u201d is unavailing\n    because \u00a71146(a) specifies not only that a transfer be \u201cunder a plan,\u201d\n    but also that the plan be confirmed pursuant to \u00a71129. Ultimately\n    this Court need not decide whether \u00a71146(a) is unambiguous on its\n    face, for, based on the parties\u2019 other arguments, any ambiguity must\n    be resolved in Florida\u2019s favor. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Even on the assumption that \u00a71146(a)\u2019s text is ambiguous, read-\n    ing it in context with other relevant Code provisions reveals nothing\n    justifying Piccadilly\u2019s claims that had Congress intended \u00a71146(a) to\n    apply exclusively to postconfirmation transfers, it would have made\n    its intent plain with an express temporal limitation, and that \u201cunder\u201d\n    should be construed broadly to mean in \u201cin accordance with.\u201d If\n    statutory context suggests anything, it is that \u00a71146(a) is inapplica-\n    ble to preconfirmation transfers. The provision\u2019s placement in a sub-\n    chapter entitled \u201cPOSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS\u201d undermines\n    Piccadilly\u2019s view that it extends to preconfirmation transfers. Picca-\n    dilly\u2019s textual and contextual arguments, even if fully accepted,\n    would establish at most that the statutory language is ambiguous,\n    not that the purported ambiguity should be resolved in Piccadilly\u2019s\n    favor. Pp. 7\u201313.\n       (c) The federalism canon articulated in California State Bd. of\n    Equalization v. Sierra Summit, Inc., 490 U. S. 844, 851\u2013852\u2014that\n    courts should \u201cproceed carefully when asked to recognize an exemp-\n    tion from state taxation that Congress has not clearly expressed \u201d\u2014\n    obliges the Court to construe \u00a71146(a)\u2019s exemption narrowly. Picca-\n    dilly\u2019s interpretation would require the Court to do exactly what the\n    canon counsels against: recognize an exemption that Congress has\n    not clearly expressed, namely, an exemption for preconfirmation\n    transfers.

PICCADILLY CAFETERIAS, INC.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                                [June 16, 2008]\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Bankruptcy Code provides a stamp-tax exemption\nfor any asset transfer \u201cunder a plan confirmed under\n[Chapter 11]\u201d of the Code. 11 U. S. C. \u00a71146(a) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. V). Respondent Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., was\ngranted an exemption for assets transferred after it had\nfiled for bankruptcy but before its Chapter 11 plan was\nsubmitted to, and confirmed by, the Bankruptcy Court.\nPetitioner, the Florida Department of Revenue, seeks\nreversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding\nthe exemption for Piccadilly\u2019s asset transfer. Because we\nhold that \u00a71146(a)\u2019s stamp-tax exemption does not apply\nto transfers made before a plan is confirmed under Chap-\nter 11, we reverse the judgment below.\n                             I\n   Piccadilly was founded in 1944 and was one of the Na-\ntion\u2019s most successful cafeteria chains until it began ex-\nperiencing financial difficulties in the last decade. On\nOctober 29, 2003, Piccadilly declared bankruptcy under\nChapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, \u00a71101 et seq. (2000 ed.\nand Supp. V), and requested court authorization to sell\n2          FLORIDA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. PICCADILLY\n                      CAFETERIAS, INC.\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsubstantially all its assets outside the ordinary course of\nbusiness pursuant to \u00a7363(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Pic-\ncadilly prepared to sell its assets as a going concern and\nsought an exemption from any stamp taxes on the even-\ntual transfer under \u00a71146(a) of the Code.1 The Bank-\nruptcy Court conducted an auction in which the winning\nbidder agreed to purchase Piccadilly\u2019s assets for $80\nmillion.\n  On January 26, 2004, as a precondition to the sale,\nPiccadilly entered into a global settlement agreement with\ncommittees of senior secured noteholders and unsecured\ncreditors. The settlement agreement dictated the priority\nof distribution of the sale proceeds among Piccadilly\u2019s\ncreditors. On February 13, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court\napproved the proposed sale and settlement agreement.\nThe court also ruled that the transfer of assets was ex-\nempt from stamp taxes under \u00a71146(a). The sale closed on\nMarch 16, 2004.\n  Piccadilly filed its initial Chapter 11 plan in the Bank-\nruptcy Court on March 26, 2004, and filed an amended\nplan on July 31, 2004.2 The plan provided for distribution\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 When litigation commenced in the lower courts, the stamp-tax ex-\n\nemption was contained in \u00a71146(c) (2000 ed.). In 2005, Congress\nrepealed subsections (a) and (b), and the stamp-tax exemption was\nrecodified as \u00a71146(a). See Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Con-\nsumer Protection Act of 2005, \u00a7719(b)(3), 119 Stat. 133. For simplicity,\nwe will cite the provision as it is currently codified.\n   2 Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings ordinarily culminate in the\n\nconfirmation of a reorganization plan. But in some cases, as here, a\ndebtor sells all or substantially all its assets under \u00a7363(b)(1) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. V) before seeking or receiving plan confirmation. In this sce-\nnario, the debtor typically submits for confirmation a plan of liquida-\ntion (rather than a traditional plan of reorganization) providing for the\ndistribution of the proceeds resulting from the sale. Here, Piccadilly\nfiled a Chapter 11 liquidation plan after selling substantially all its\nassets as a going concern. Although the central purpose of Chapter 11\nis to facilitate reorganizations rather than liquidations (covered gener-\nally by Chapter 7), Chapter 11 expressly contemplates liquidations.\n                     Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof the sale proceeds in a manner consistent with the set-\ntlement agreement. Before the Bankruptcy Court con-\nfirmed the plan, Florida filed an objection, seeking a dec-\nlaration that the $39,200 in stamp taxes it had assessed\non certain of Piccadilly\u2019s transferred assets fell outside\n\u00a71146(a)\u2019s exemption because the transfer had not been\n\u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d under Chapter 11. On October\n21, 2004, the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan. On\ncross-motions for summary judgment on the stamp-tax\nissue, the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment\nin favor of Piccadilly, reasoning that the sale of substan-\ntially all Piccadilly\u2019s assets was a transfer \u201c \u2018under\u2019 \u201d its\nconfirmed plan because the sale was necessary to con-\nsummate the plan. App. D to Pet. for Cert. 40a\u201341a. The\nDistrict Court upheld the decision on the ground that\n\u00a71146(a), in certain circumstances, affords a stamp-tax\nexemption even when a transfer occurs prior to confirma-\ntion. In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 379 B. R. 215, 226\n(SD Fla. 2006).\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed,\nholding that \u201c\u00a71146[(a)]\u2019s tax exemption may apply to\nthose pre-confirmation transfers that are necessary to the\nconsummation of a confirmed plan of reorganization,\nwhich, at the very least, requires that there be some nexus\nbetween the pre-confirmation transfer and the confirmed\nplan.\u201d In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 484 F. 3d 1299,\n1304 (2007) (per curiam). Finding the statutory text\nambiguous, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u00a71146(a)\nshould be interpreted consistent with \u201cthe principle that a\nremedial statute such as the Bankruptcy Code should be\nliberally construed.\u201d Ibid. The court further noted that its\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSee \u00a71129(a)(11) (2000 ed.) (\u201cConfirmation of the plan is not likely to be\nfollowed by the liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganiza-\ntion, of the debtor or any successor to the debtor under the plan, unless\nsuch liquidation or reorganization is proposed in the plan\u201d).\n4         FLORIDA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. PICCADILLY\n                     CAFETERIAS, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation of \u00a71146(a) better accounted for \u201cthe practi-\ncal realities of Chapter 11 reorganization cases\u201d because a\ndebtor may need to transfer assets to induce relevant\nparties to endorse the proposed confirmation of a plan.\nIbid. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that its holding\nconflicted with the approach taken by the Courts of Ap-\npeals for the Third and Fourth Circuits, id., at 1302, which\nhave held that \u00a71146(a) \u201cdoes not apply to . . . transactions\nthat occur prior to the confirmation of a plan under Chap-\nter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d In re Hechinger Inv. Co.\nof Del., 335 F. 3d 243, 246 (CA3 2003); see also In re NVR,\nLP, 189 F. 3d 442, 458 (CA4 1999) (holding that \u00a71146(a)\n\u201cappl[ies] only to transfers under the Plan occurring after\nthe date of confirmation\u201d).\n   We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), to resolve\nthe conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to whether\n\u00a71146(a) applies to preconfirmation transfers.\n                             II\n  Section 1146(a), entitled \u201cSpecial tax provisions,\u201d pro-\nvides: \u201cThe issuance, transfer, or exchange of a security, or\nthe making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under\na plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title, may not\nbe taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar\ntax.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Florida asserts that \u00a71146(a)\napplies only to postconfirmation sales; Piccadilly contends\nthat it extends to preconfirmation transfers as long as\nthey are made in accordance with a plan that is eventually\nconfirmed. Florida and Piccadilly base their competing\nreadings of \u00a71146(a) on the provision\u2019s text, on inferences\ndrawn from other Code provisions, and on substantive\ncanons of statutory construction. We consider each of\ntheir arguments in turn.\n                            A\n    Florida contends that \u00a71146(a)\u2019s text unambiguously\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlimits stamp-tax exemptions to postconfirmation transfers\nmade under the authority of a confirmed plan. It observes\nthat the word \u201cconfirmed\u201d modifies the word \u201cplan\u201d and is\na past participle, i.e., \u201c[a] verb form indicating past or\ncompleted action or time that is used as a verbal adjective\nin phrases such as baked beans and finished work.\u201d\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary 1287 (4th ed. 2000). Flor-\nida maintains that a past participle indicates past or\ncompleted action even when it is placed after the noun it\nmodifies, as in \u201cbeans baked in the oven,\u201d or \u201cwork fin-\nished after midnight.\u201d Thus, it argues, the phrase \u201cplan\nconfirmed\u201d denotes a \u201cconfirmed plan\u201d\u2014meaning one that\nhas been confirmed in the past.\n    Florida further contends that the word \u201cunder\u201d in \u201cun-\nder a plan confirmed\u201d should be read to mean \u201cwith the\nauthorization of \u201d or \u201cinferior or subordinate\u201d to its refer-\nent, here the confirmed plan. See Ardestani v. INS, 502\nU. S. 129, 135 (1991) (noting that a thing that is \u201c \u2018under\u2019 \u201d\na statute is most naturally read as being \u201c \u2018subject to\u2019 \u201d or\n\u201c \u2018governed by\u2019 \u201d the statute). Florida points out that, in\nthe other two appearances of \u201cunder\u201d in \u00a71146(a), it clearly\nmeans \u201csubject to.\u201d Invoking the textual canon that\n\u201c \u2018identical words used in different parts of the same act\nare intended to have the same meaning,\u2019 \u201d Commissioner v.\nKeystone Consol. Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 159\n(1993), Florida asserts the term must also have its core\nmeaning of \u201csubject to\u201d in the phrase \u201cunder a plan con-\nfirmed.\u201d Florida thus reasons that to be eligible for\n\u00a71146(a)\u2019s exemption, a transfer must be subject to a plan\nthat has been confirmed subject to \u00a71129 (2000 ed. and\nSupp. V). Echoing the Fourth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in NVR,\nsupra, at 457, Florida concludes that a transfer made prior\nto the date of plan confirmation cannot be subject to, or\nunder the authority of, something that did not exist at the\ntime of the transfer\u2014a confirmed plan.\n    Piccadilly counters that the statutory language does not\n6        FLORIDA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. PICCADILLY\n                    CAFETERIAS, INC.\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nunambiguously impose a temporal requirement. It con-\ntends that \u201cplan confirmed\u201d is not necessarily the equiva-\nlent of \u201cconfirmed plan,\u201d and that had Congress intended\nthe latter, it would have used that language, as it did in a\nrelated Code provision. See \u00a71142(b) (referring to \u201cany\ninstrument required to effect a transfer of property dealt\nwith by a confirmed plan\u201d). Piccadilly also argues that\n\u201cunder\u201d is just as easily read to mean \u201cin accordance with.\u201d\nIt observes that the variability of the term \u201cunder\u201d is well-\ndocumented, noting that the American Heritage Diction-\nary 1395 (1976) provides 15 definitions, including \u201c[i]n\nview of,\u201d \u201cbecause of,\u201d \u201cby virtue of,\u201d as well as \u201c[s]ubject to\nthe restraint . . . of.\u201d See also Ardestani, supra, at 135\n(recognizing that \u201c[t]he word \u2018under\u2019 has many dictionary\ndefinitions and must draw its meaning from its context\u201d).\nAlthough \u201cunder\u201d appears several times in \u00a71146(a), Pic-\ncadilly maintains there is no reason why a term of such\ncommon usage and variable meaning must have the same\nmeaning each time it is used, even in the same sentence.\nAs an illustration, it points to \u00a7302(a) of the Bankruptcy\nCode, which states, \u201cThe commencement of a joint case\nunder a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief\nunder such chapter.\u201d Piccadilly contends that this provi-\nsion is best read as: \u201cThe commencement of a joint case\nsubject to the provisions of a chapter of this title consti-\ntutes an order for relief in such chapter.\u201d Piccadilly thus\nconcludes that the statutory text\u2014standing alone\u2014is\nsusceptible of more than one interpretation. See Hech-\ninger, supra, at 253 (\u201c[W]e cannot say that the language of\n[\u00a71146(a)] rules out the possibility that \u2018under a plan\nconfirmed\u2019 means \u2018in agreement with a plan confirmed\u2019 \u201d).\n   While both sides present credible interpretations of\n\u00a71146(a), Florida has the better one. To be sure, Congress\ncould have used more precise language\u2014i.e., \u201cunder a plan\nthat has been confirmed\u201d\u2014and thus removed all ambigu-\nity. But the two readings of the language that Congress\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nchose are not equally plausible: Of the two, Florida\u2019s is\nclearly the more natural. The interpretation advanced by\nPiccadilly and adopted by the Eleventh Circuit\u2014that\nthere must be \u201csome nexus between the pre-confirmation\ntransfer and the confirmed plan\u201d for \u00a71146(a) to apply, 484\nF. 3d, at 1304\u2014places greater strain on the statutory text\nthan the simpler construction advanced by Florida and\nadopted by the Third and Fourth Circuits.\n   Furthermore, Piccadilly\u2019s emphasis on the distinction\nbetween \u201cplan confirmed\u201d and \u201cconfirmed plan\u201d is unavail-\ning because \u00a71146(a) specifies not only that a tax-exempt\ntransfer be \u201cunder a plan,\u201d but also that the plan in ques-\ntion be confirmed pursuant to \u00a71129. Congress\u2019 placement\nof \u201cplan confirmed\u201d before \u201cunder section 1129\u201d avoids the\nambiguity that would have arisen had it used the term\n\u201cconfirmed plan,\u201d which could easily be read to mean that\nthe transfer must be \u201cunder section 1129\u201d rather than\nunder a plan that was itself confirmed under \u00a71129.\n   Although we agree with Florida that the more natural\nreading of \u00a71146(a) is that the exemption applies only to\npostconfirmation transfers, ultimately we need not decide\nwhether the statute is unambiguous on its face. Even\nassuming, arguendo, that the language of \u00a71146(a) is\nfacially ambiguous, the ambiguity must be resolved in\nFlorida\u2019s favor. We reach this conclusion after considering\nthe parties\u2019 other arguments, to which we now turn.\n                              B\n   Piccadilly insists that, whatever the degree of ambiguity\non its face, \u00a71146(a) becomes even more ambiguous when\nread in context with other Bankruptcy Code provisions.\nPiccadilly asserts that if Congress had intended \u00a71146(a)\nto apply exclusively to transfers occurring after confirma-\ntion, it would have made its intent plain with an express\ntemporal limitation similar to those appearing elsewhere\nin the Code. For example, \u00a71127 governs modifications to\n8        FLORIDA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. PICCADILLY\n                    CAFETERIAS, INC.\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\na Chapter 11 plan, providing that the proponent of a plan\nmay modify the plan \u201cat any time before confirmation,\u201d or,\nsubject to certain restrictions, \u201cat any time after confirma-\ntion of such plan.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71127(a)\u2013(b). Similar examples\nabound. See, e.g., \u00a71104(a) (\u201c[a]t any time after the com-\nmencement of the case but before confirmation of a plan\n. . .\u201d); \u00a71104(c) (\u201c[a]t any time before the confirmation of a\nplan . . .\u201d). Piccadilly emphasizes that, \u201cwhere Congress\nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but\nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely\nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d Russello v. United\nStates, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Because Congress did not impose a clear and\ncommonly used temporal limitation in \u00a71146(a), Piccadilly\nconcludes that Congress did not intend one to exist. Pic-\ncadilly buttresses its conclusion by pointing out that\n\u00a71146(b)\u2014the          subsection    immediately     following\n\u00a71146(a)\u2014includes an express temporal limitation. See\n\u00a71146(b) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (providing that a bankruptcy\ncourt may declare certain tax consequences after the date\na government unit responds to a plan proponent\u2019s request\nor \u201c270 days after such request,\u201d whichever is earlier).\nBut Congress included no such limitation in subsection\n(a).\n    Piccadilly also relies on other Code provisions to bolster\nits argument that the term \u201cunder\u201d preceding \u201ca plan\nconfirmed\u201d in \u00a71146(a) should be read broadly\u2014to mean\n\u201cin accordance with\u201d rather than the narrower \u201cauthorized\nby.\u201d Apart from \u00a7302, discussed above, Piccadilly adverts\nto \u00a7111, which states that an agency providing credit\ncounseling to debtors is required to meet \u201cthe standards\nset forth under this section.\u201d \u00a7111(b)(4)(A) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. V). Piccadilly argues that this language requires\nthe agency to meet \u201cthe standards set forth in this sec-\ntion,\u201d because reading the quoted language to mean \u201cthe\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstandards set forth authorized by this section\u201d would\nrender the words \u201cset forth\u201d nonsensical. Piccadilly addi-\ntionally refers to \u00a7303(a), which provides that \u201c[a]n invol-\nuntary case may be commenced only under chapter 7 or 11\nof this title.\u201d Again, Piccadilly asserts that this language\nmeans \u201can involuntary case may be commenced only in\nchapter 7 or 11 of this title.\u201d It reasons that \u201cunder\u201d in\n\u00a7303(a) cannot mean \u201cauthorized by\u201d because \u00a7303(a) itself\nauthorizes involuntary cases, and the provisions of Chap-\nters 7 and 11 do not. Piccadilly makes a similar argument\nwith respect to \u00a7343, which provides that \u201c[t]he debtor\nshall appear and submit to examination under oath at the\nmeeting of creditors.\u201d Reading \u201cunder\u201d to mean \u201cauthor-\nized by\u201d would make little sense here. On the basis of\nthese examples, Piccadilly concludes that the term \u201cunder\u201d\nis ambiguous.\n   Finally, Piccadilly maintains that \u201cunder\u201d in \u00a71146(a)\nshould be construed broadly in light of \u00a7365(g)(1) of the\nBankruptcy Code, which provides that rejection of an\nexecutory contract or unexpired lease constitutes the\nequivalent of a prebankruptcy breach \u201cif such contract or\nlease has not been assumed under this section or under a\nplan confirmed under chapter . . . 11.\u201d In Hechinger, the\nThird Circuit concluded that substituting \u201cauthorized by\u201d\nfor \u201cunder\u201d in \u00a71146(a) would be consistent with the use of\nthe parallel language in \u00a7365(g)(1). 335 F. 3d, at 254.\nPiccadilly attempts to refute Hechinger\u2019s reading of\n\u00a7365(g)(1), asserting that, because authorization for the\nassumption of a lease under a plan is described in\n\u00a71123(b)(2), which \u201ccircles back to section 365,\u201d such au-\nthorization cannot be \u201csubject to\u201d or \u201cauthorized by\u201d Chap-\nter 11. Brief for Respondent 39 (emphasis deleted); see 11\nU. S. C. \u00a71123(b)(2) (providing that \u201ca plan may . . . sub-\nject to section 365 of this title, provide for the assumption,\nrejection, or assignment of any executory contract or un-\nexpired lease of the debtor not previously rejected under\n10       FLORIDA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. PICCADILLY\n                    CAFETERIAS, INC.\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch section\u201d). The phrase \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d in\n\u00a7365(g)(1), contends Piccadilly, is thus best read to mean\n\u201cin accordance with a plan confirmed\u201d because a plan may\nprovide for the assumption of an executory contract or\nunexpired lease but not\u2014unlike \u00a7365\u2014be the ultimate\nauthority for that assumption. As a result, Piccadilly\nconcludes that the identical language of \u00a71146(a) should\nhave the same meaning.\n   Piccadilly supports this point with its assertion that,\nunlike sales, postconfirmation assumptions or rejections\nare not permitted under the Bankruptcy Code. See NLRB\nv. Bildisco & Bildisco, 465 U. S. 513, 529 (1984) (stating\nthat in \u201ca Chapter 11 reorganization, a debtor-in-\npossession has until a reorganization plan is confirmed to\ndecide whether to accept or reject an executory contract\u201d).\nBecause, as Piccadilly contends, the phrase \u201cunder a plan\nconfirmed under chapter . . . 11\u201d in \u00a7365(g)(1) cannot refer\nto assumptions or rejections occurring after confirmation,\nit would be anomalous to read the identical phrase in\n\u00a71146(a) to cover only postconfirmation transfers.\n   For its part, Florida argues that the statutory context of\n\u00a71146(a) supports its position that the stamp-tax exemp-\ntion applies exclusively to postconfirmation transfers. It\nobserves that the subchapter in which \u00a71146(a) appears is\nentitled, \u201cPOSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS.\u201d Florida\ncontends that, while not dispositive, the placement of a\nprovision in a particular subchapter suggests that its\nterms should be interpreted consistent with that subchap-\nter. See Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S.\n803, 809 (1989) (\u201cIt is a fundamental canon of statutory\nconstruction that the words of a statute must be read in\ntheir context and with a view to their place in the overall\nstatutory scheme\u201d). In addition, Florida dismisses Picca-\ndilly\u2019s references to the temporal limitations in other Code\nprovisions on the ground that it would have been super-\nfluous for Congress to add any further limitations to\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71146(a)\u2019s already unambiguous temporal element.\n   Even on the assumption that the text of \u00a71146(a) is\nambiguous, we are not persuaded by Piccadilly\u2019s contex-\ntual arguments. As noted above, Congress could have\nused language that made \u00a71146(a)\u2019s temporal element\nclear beyond question. Unlike \u00a71146(a), however, the\ntemporal language examples quoted by Piccadilly are\nindispensable to the operative meaning of the provisions\nin which they appear. Piccadilly\u2019s reliance on \u00a71127, for\nexample, is misplaced because that section explicitly\ndifferentiates between preconfirmation modifications, see\n\u00a71127(a), and postconfirmation modifications, which are\npermissible \u201conly if circumstances warrant\u201d them,\n\u00a71127(b). It was unnecessary for Congress to include in\n\u00a71146(a) a phrase such as \u201cat any time after confirmation\nof such plan\u201d because the phrase \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d\nis most naturally read to require that there be a confirmed\nplan at the time of the transfer.\n   Even if we were to adopt Piccadilly\u2019s broad definition of\n\u201cunder,\u201d its interpretation of the statute faces other obsta-\ncles. The asset transfer here can hardly be said to have\nbeen consummated \u201cin accordance with\u201d any confirmed\nplan because, as of the closing date, Piccadilly had not\neven submitted its plan to the Bankruptcy Court for con-\nfirmation. Piccadilly\u2019s asset sale was thus not conducted\n\u201cin accordance with\u201d any plan confirmed under Chapter\n11. Rather, it was conducted \u201cin accordance with\u201d the\nprocedures set forth in Chapter 3\u2014specifically, \u00a7363(b)(1).\nTo read the statute as Piccadilly proposes would make\n\u00a71146(a)\u2019s exemption turn on whether a debtor-in-\npossession\u2019s actions are consistent with a legal instrument\nthat does not exist\u2014and indeed may not even be conceived\nof\u2014at the time of the sale. Reading \u00a71146(a) in context\nwith other relevant Code provisions, we find nothing\njustifying such a curious interpretation of what is a\nstraightforward exemption.\n12         FLORIDA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. PICCADILLY\n                      CAFETERIAS, INC.\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Nor does anything in \u00a7365(g)(1) recommend Piccadilly\u2019s\nreading of \u00a71146(a). Section 365(g) generally allows a\ntrustee to reject \u201can executory contract or unexpired lease\nof the debtor,\u201d i.e., to reject a contract that is unfavorable\nto the estate, subject to court approval. As the text makes\nclear, such approval may occur either under \u201cthis section,\u201d\n\u00a7365(g)\u2014i.e., \u201cat any time before the confirmation of a\nplan,\u201d \u00a7365(d)(2)\u2014or \u201cunder a plan confirmed under chap-\nter 9, 11, 12, or 13,\u201d \u00a7365(g)(1). Piccadilly relies heavily on\nBildisco, supra, in which this Court held that \u00a7365\npermits a debtor-in-possession to reject a collective-\nbargaining agreement like any other executory contract,\nand that doing so is not an unfair labor practice under the\nNational Labor Relations Act. In reaching this conclusion,\nthe Court observed that \u201ca debtor-in-possession has until a\nreorganization plan is confirmed to decide whether to\naccept or reject an executory contract.\u201d 465 U. S., at 529\n(emphasis added).\n   We agree with Bildisco\u2019s commonsense observation that\nthe decision whether to reject a contract or lease must be\nmade before confirmation. But that in no way undermines\nthe fact that the rejection takes effect upon or after con-\nfirmation of the Chapter 11 plan (or before confirmation if\npursuant to \u00a7365(d)(2)). In the context of \u00a71146(a), the\ndecision whether to transfer a given asset \u201cunder a plan\nconfirmed\u201d must be made prior to submitting the Chapter\n11 plan to the bankruptcy court, but the transfer itself\ncannot be \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d until the court con-\nfirms the plan in question. Only at that point does the\ntransfer become eligible for the stamp-tax exemption. 3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Also meritless is Piccadilly\u2019s argument that \u201cunder\u201d in the phrase\n\n\u201cunder a plan confirmed under chapter . . . 11\u201d in \u00a7365(g)(1) cannot be\nread to mean \u201csubject to\u201d because \u00a71123(b)(2), in Piccadilly\u2019s words,\n\u201ccircles back to section 365.\u201d Brief for Respondent 39.

We\nfind it informative that Congress placed \u00a71146(a) in a\nsubchapter entitled, \u201cPOSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS.\u201d\nTo be sure, a subchapter heading cannot substitute for the\noperative text of the statute. See, e.g., Pennsylvania Dept.\nof Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212 (1998) (\u201c \u2018[T]he\ntitle of a statute . . . cannot limit the plain meaning of the\ntext\u2019 \u201d). Nonetheless, statutory titles and section headings\n\u201c \u2018are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the\nmeaning of a statute.\u2019 \u201d Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516,\n528 (2002). The placement of \u00a71146(a) within a subchap-\nter expressly limited to postconfirmation matters under-\nmines Piccadilly\u2019s view that \u00a71146(a) covers preconfirma-\ntion transfers.\n    But even if we were fully to accept Piccadilly\u2019s textual\nand contextual arguments, they would establish at most\nthat the statutory language is ambiguous. They do not\u2014\nand largely are not intended to\u2014demonstrate that\n\u00a71146(a)\u2019s purported ambiguity should be resolved in\nPiccadilly\u2019s favor. Florida argues that various nontextual\ncanons of construction require us to resolve any ambiguity\nin its favor. Piccadilly responds with substantive canons\nof its own. It is to these dueling canons of construction\nthat we now turn.\n                            C\n   Florida contends that even if the statutory text is\ndeemed ambiguous, applicable substantive canons compel\nits interpretation of \u00a71146(a). Florida first invokes the\ncanon that \u201cCongress is presumed to be aware of an ad-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthat the plan do so in a manner consistent with the various require-\nments set forth throughout \u00a7365. By contrast, the phrase \u201cunder this\nsection\u201d in \u00a7365(g)(1) serves as a reference to \u00a7365(d)(2), which permits\npreconfirmation assumptions and rejections pursuant to a court order\n(and not, as in \u00a71123(b)(2), pursuant to a confirmed plan).\n14      FLORIDA DEPT.

Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580\u2013581\n(1978). Florida observes that the relevant language of\n\u00a71146(a) relating to \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d has re-\nmained unchanged since 1978 despite several revisions of\nthe Bankruptcy Code. The most recent revision in 2005\noccurred after the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in NVR and\nthe Third Circuit\u2019s decision in Hechinger but before the\nEleventh Circuit\u2019s decision below. Florida asserts that\nCongress ratified this longstanding interpretation when,\nin its most recent amendments to the Code, it \u201creadopted\u201d\nthe stamp-tax provision verbatim as \u00a71146(a). Brief for\nPetitioner 26.\n   Florida also invokes the substantive canon\u2014on which\nthe Third Circuit relied in Hechinger\u2014that courts should\n\u201c \u2018proceed carefully when asked to recognize an exemption\nfrom state taxation that Congress has not clearly ex-\npressed.\u2019 \u201d 335 F. 3d, at 254 (quoting California State Bd.\nof Equalization v. Sierra Summit, Inc., 490 U. S. 844, 851\u2013\n852 (1989)). In light of this directive, Florida contends\nthat \u00a71146(a)\u2019s language must be construed strictly in\nfavor of the States to prevent unwarranted displacement\nof their tax laws. See National Private Truck Council, Inc.\nv. Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, 515 U.

See id., at 586, 590. Florida\ncontends that the Court of Appeals\u2019 extension of \u00a71146(a)\nto preconfirmation transfers directly interferes with the\nadministration of the State\u2019s stamp tax, which is imposed\n\u201cprior to recordation\u201d of the instrument of transfer.

Alternatively, should a court grant\nan exemption under \u00a71146(a) before confirmation, States\nwould be saddled with the task of monitoring whether the\nplan is ever eventually confirmed.\n    In response, Piccadilly contends that the federalism\nprinciple articulated in Sierra Summit, supra, at 852, does\nnot apply where there is a \u201cclear expression of an exemp-\ntion from state taxation\u201d overriding a State\u2019s authority to\ntax. In Piccadilly\u2019s view, that is precisely the case with\nregard to \u00a71146(a), which proscribes the imposition of\nstamp taxes and demonstrates Congress\u2019 intent to exempt\na category of state taxation.\n    Piccadilly further maintains that Florida\u2019s stamp tax is\nnothing more than a postpetition claim, specifically an\nadministrative expense, which is paid as a priority claim\nahead of the prepetition claims of most creditors. Equat-\ning Florida\u2019s receipt of tax revenue with a preference in\nfavor of a particular claimant, Piccadilly argues that\n\u00a71146(a)\u2019s ambiguous exemption should not be construed\nto diminish other claimants\u2019 recoveries. See Howard\nDelivery Service, Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co., 547\nU. S. 651, 667 (2006) (emphasizing that \u201cprovisions allow-\ning preferences must be tightly construed\u201d). Reading the\nstamp-tax exemption too narrowly, Piccadilly maintains,\n\u201c \u2018is not only inconsistent with the policy of equality of\ndistribution\u2019 \u201d but also \u201c \u2018dilutes the value of the priority for\nthose creditors Congress intended to prefer\u2019 \u201d\u2014those with\nprepetition claims.

In Piccadilly\u2019s view, any ambiguity in the\nstatutory text is overshadowed by \u00a71146(a)\u2019s obvious\npurpose: to facilitate the Chapter 11 process \u201cthrough\ngiving tax relief.\u201d In re Jacoby-Bender, Inc., 758 F. 2d 840,\n841 (CA2 1985). Piccadilly characterizes the tax on asset\ntransfers at issue here as tantamount to a levy on the\nbankruptcy process itself. A stamp tax like Florida\u2019s\nmakes the sale of a debtor\u2019s property more expensive and\nreduces the total proceeds available to satisfy the credi-\ntors\u2019 claims, contrary to Congress\u2019 clear intent in enacting\n\u00a71146(a).\n   What is unclear, Piccadilly argues, is why \u201cCongress\nwould have intended the anomaly that a transfer essential\nto a plan that occurs two minutes before confirmation may\nbe taxed, but the same transfer occurring two seconds\nafter may not.\u201d Brief for Respondent 43. After all, inter-\npreting \u00a71146(a) in the manner Florida proposes would\nlead precisely to that result. And that, Piccadilly asserts,\nis \u201cabsurd\u201d in light of \u00a71146(a)\u2019s policy aim\u2014evidenced by\nthe provision\u2019s text and legislative history\u2014of reducing\nthe cost of asset transfers. In that vein, Piccadilly con-\ntends that interpreting \u00a71146(a) to apply solely to postcon-\nfirmation transfers would undermine Chapter 11\u2019s twin\nobjectives of \u201cpreserving going concerns and maximizing\nproperty available to satisfy creditors.\u201d Bank of America\nNat.

In order to obtain\nthe maximum value for its assets\u2014especially assets rap-\nidly declining in value\u2014Piccadilly claims that a debtor\noften must close the sale before formal confirmation of the\nChapter 11 plan.\n   We agree with Florida that the federalism canon articu-\nlated in Sierra Summit and elsewhere obliges us to con-\nstrue \u00a71146(a)\u2019s exemption narrowly. Piccadilly\u2019s effort to\nevade the canon falls well short of the mark because read-\ning \u00a71146(a) in the manner Piccadilly proposes would\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

Sierra Summit, 490 U. S., at 851\u2013852 (empha-\nsis added); see also Swarts v. Hammer, 194 U. S. 441, 444\n(1904) (reasoning that if Congress endeavored to exempt a\ndebtor from state and local taxation, \u201cthe intention would\nbe clearly expressed, not left to be collected or inferred\nfrom disputable considerations of convenience in adminis-\ntering the estate of the bankrupt\u201d). Indeed, Piccadilly\nproves precisely this point by resting its entire case on the\npremise that Congress has expressed its stamp-tax ex-\nemption in ambiguous language. Therefore, far from\nbeing inapposite, the canon is decisive in this case.\n   The canons on which Piccadilly relies are inapposite.\nWhile we agree with Piccadilly that \u201cprovisions allowing\npreferences must be tightly construed,\u201d Howard Delivery\nServ., supra, at 667, \u00a71146(a) is not a preference-granting\nprovision.    The statutory text makes no mention of\npreferences.\n   Nor are we persuaded that in this case we should con-\nstrue \u00a71146(a) \u201cliberally\u201d to serve its ostensibly \u201cremedial\u201d\npurpose. Based on the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s declaration that\nthe Bankruptcy Code is a \u201cremedial statute,\u201d Piccadilly\nwould stretch the disallowance well beyond what the\nstatutory text can naturally bear. Apart from the opinion\nbelow, however, the only authority Piccadilly offers is a\n1952 decision of this Court interpreting the Shipping\nCommissioners Act of 1872. See Brief for Respondent 54\n(citing Isbrandtsen, supra, at 782). But unlike the statu-\ntory scheme in Isbrandtsen, which was \u201c \u2018designed to se-\ncure the comfort and health of seamen aboard ship, hospi-\ntalization at home and care abroad,\u2019 \u201d 343 U.

To the\ncontrary, this Court has rejected the notion that \u201cCongress\nhad a single purpose in enacting Chapter 11.\u201d Toibb v.\nRadloff, 501 U. S. 157, 163 (1991). Rather, Chapter 11\nstrikes a balance between a debtor\u2019s interest in reorganiz-\ning and restructuring its debts and the creditors\u2019 interest\nin maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate. Ibid.\nThe Code also accommodates the interests of the States in\nregulating property transfers by \u201c \u2018generally [leaving] the\ndetermination of property rights in the assets of a bank-\nrupt\u2019s estate to state law.\u2019 \u201d Travelers Casualty & Surety\nCo. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U. S. ___,\n___ (2007) (slip op., at 7 ). Such interests often do not\ncoincide, and in this case, they clearly do not. We there-\nfore decline to construe the exemption granted by \u00a71146(a)\nto the detriment of the State.\n  As for Piccadilly\u2019s assertion that reading \u00a71146(a) to\nallow preconfirmation transfers to be taxed while exempt-\ning others moments later would amount to an \u201cabsurd\u201d\npolicy, we reiterate that \u201c \u2018it is not for us to substitute our\nview of . . . policy for the legislation which has been passed\nby Congress.\u2019 \u201d Hechinger, 335 F. 3d, at 256. That said,\nwe see no absurdity in reading \u00a71146(a) as setting forth a\nsimple, bright-line rule instead of the complex, after-the-\nfact inquiry Piccadilly envisions. At bottom, we agree with\nthe Fourth Circuit\u2019s summation of \u00a71146(a):\n     \u201cCongress struck a most reasonable balance. If a\n     debtor is able to develop a Chapter 11 reorganization\n     and obtain confirmation, then the debtor is to be af-\n     forded relief from certain taxation to facilitate the im-\n     plementation of the reorganization plan. Before a\n     debtor reaches this point, however, the state and local\n     tax systems may not be subjected to federal interfer-\n     ence.\u201d NVR, 189 F. 3d, at 458.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

See, e.g., Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14 ) (\u201cWe are not at lib-\nerty to rewrite the statute to reflect a meaning we deem\nmore desirable\u201d).\n                            III\n   The most natural reading of \u00a71146(a)\u2019s text, the provi-\nsion\u2019s placement within the Code, and applicable substan-\ntive canons all lead to the same conclusion: Section\n1146(a) affords a stamp-tax exemption only to transfers\nmade pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan that has been con-\nfirmed. Because Piccadilly transferred its assets before its\nChapter 11 plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court,\nit may not rely on \u00a71146(a) to avoid Florida\u2019s stamp taxes.\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment below and remand\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

S. C. \u00a71146(a) (2000 ed., Supp V)\n(previously \u00a71146(c)) (emphasis added). In this case, the\ndebtor\u2019s reorganization \u201cplan\u201d provides for the \u201ctransfer\u201d of\nassets. But the \u201cplan\u201d itself was not \u201cconfirmed under\nsection 1129 of this title\u201d (i.e., the Bankruptcy Judge did\nnot formally approve the plan) until after the \u201ctransfer\u201d of\nassets took place. See \u00a71129 (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (de-\ntailing the requirements for bankruptcy court approval of\na Chapter 11 plan).\n   Hence we must ask whether the time of transfer mat-\nters. Do the statutory words \u201cunder a plan confirmed\nunder section 1129 of this title\u201d apply only where a trans-\nfer takes place \u201cunder a plan\u201d that at the time of the\ntransfer already has been \u201cconfirmed under section 1129 of\nthis title\u201d? Or, do they also apply where a transfer takes\nplace \u201cunder a plan\u201d that subsequently is \u201cconfirmed under\nsection 1129 of this title\u201d? The Court concludes that the\nstatutory phrase applies only where a transfer takes place\n\u201cunder a plan\u201d that at the time of transfer already has\nbeen \u201cconfirmed under section 1129 of this title.\u201d In my\n2        FLORIDA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. PICCADILLY\n                    CAFETERIAS, INC.\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nview, however, the statutory phrase applies \u201cunder a plan\u201d\nthat at the time of transfer either already has been or\nsubsequently is \u201cconfirmed.\u201d In a word, the majority be-\nlieves that the time (pre- or post-transfer) at which the\nbankruptcy judge confirms the reorganization plan mat-\nters. I believe that it does not. (And construing the provi-\nsion to refer to a plan that simply \u201cis\u201d confirmed would\nrequire us to read fewer words into the statute than the\nCourt\u2019s construction, which reads the provision to refer\nonly to a plan \u201cthat has been\u201d confirmed, ante, at 19.)\n   The statutory language itself is perfectly ambiguous on\nthe point. Linguistically speaking, it is no more difficult to\napply the words \u201cplan confirmed\u201d to instances in which the\n\u201cplan\u201d subsequently is \u201cconfirmed\u201d than to restrict their\napplication to instances in which the \u201cplan\u201d already has\nbeen \u201cconfirmed.\u201d See In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 484\nF. 3d 1299, 1304 (CA11 2007) (per curiam) (\u201c[T]he statute\ncan plausibly be read either as describing eligible trans-\nfers to include transfers \u2018under a plan confirmed\u2019 regard-\nless of when the plan is confirmed, or . . . imposing a tem-\nporal restriction on when the confirmation of the plan\nmust occur\u201d (emphasis in original)). Cf. In re Hechinger\nInv. Co. of Del., 335 F. 3d 243, 252\u2013253 (CA3 2003) (major-\nity opinion of Alito, J.)

Indeed, the\nmajority, after methodically combing the textualist\nbeaches, finds that a comparison with other somewhat\nsimilar phrases in the Bankruptcy Code sheds little light.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nFor example, on the one hand, if Congress thought the\ntime of confirmation mattered, why did it not say so ex-\npressly as it has done elsewhere in the Code? See, e.g., 11\nU. S. C. \u00a71127(b) (plan proponent may modify it \u201cat any\ntime after confirmation\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a71104(a) (\u201c[a]t\nany time after the commencement of the case but before\nconfirmation\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a71104(c) (\u201cat any time\nbefore the confirmation of a plan\u201d (emphasis added));\n\u00a71114(e)(2) (\u201cbefore a plan confirmed under section 1129 of\nthis title is effective\u201d (emphasis added)). On the other\nhand, if Congress thought the time of confirmation did not\nmatter, why did it place this provision in a subchapter\nentitled \u201cPOSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS\u201d? See 11\nU. S. C., ch. 11, subch. III. (And yet one could also argue\nthat the tax exemption provision appears under the \u201cpost-\nconfirmation matters\u201d title because the trigger for the\nexemption is plan confirmation. Thus, the exemption is a\n\u201cpostconfirmation matter,\u201d regardless of when the transfer\noccurs.)\n  The canons of interpretation offer little help. And the\nmajority, for the most part, seems to agree. It ultimately\nrests its interpretive conclusion upon this Court\u2019s state-\nment that courts \u201cmust proceed carefully when asked to\nrecognize an exemption from state taxation that Congress\nhas not clearly expressed.\u201d California State Bd. of Equali-\nzation v. Sierra Summit, Inc., 490 U. S. 844, 851\u2013852\n(1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). See ante, at\n17. But when, as here, we interpret a provision the ex-\npress point of which is to exempt some category of state\ntaxation, how can the statement in Sierra Summit prove\ndeterminative? See \u00a71146(a) (\u201cThe issuance, transfer, or\nexchange of a security, or the making or delivery of an\ninstrument of transfer under a plan confirmed under\nsection 1129 of this title, may not be taxed under any law\nimposing a stamp tax or similar tax\u201d (emphasis added)).\n  Neither does Florida\u2019s related claim, protesting federal\n4        FLORIDA DEPT.

See Brief for Petitioner 32\u201333\n(noting the \u201cadditional difficulties and complexities that\nwill proliferate\u201d under the lower court\u2019s decision). If Flor-\nida now requires transferees to file a pre-existing con-\nfirmed plan in order to avoid payment of the stamp tax,\nthen why could Florida not require a transferee under a\nnot-yet-confirmed plan to pay the stamp tax and then file\nthe plan after its confirmation in order to obtain a refund?\n(If there is some other, less curable, practical problem,\nFlorida has not explained what it is.) Given these difficul-\nties, I suspect that the majority\u2019s reliance upon Sierra\nSummit\u2019s \u201ccanon,\u201d ante, at 14, reflects no more than an\neffort to find the proverbial \u201cany port\u201d in this interpretive\nstorm.\n   The absence of a clear answer in text or canons, how-\never, should not lead us to judicial despair. Consistent\nwith Court precedent, we can and should ask a further\nquestion: Why would Congress have insisted upon tempo-\nral limits? What reasonable purpose might such limits\nserve? See, e.g., Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481,\n486 (2006) (\u201cInterpretation of a word or phrase depends\nupon reading the whole statutory text, considering the\npurpose and context of the statute, and consulting any\nprecedents or authorities that inform the analysis\u201d (em-\nphasis added)); Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337,\n346 (1997) (the Court\u2019s construction of a statute\u2019s meaning\nbased in part on its consideration of the statute\u2019s \u201cprimary\npurpose\u201d (emphasis added)). In fact, the majority\u2019s read-\ning of temporal limits in \u00a71146(a) serves no reasonable\ncongressional purpose at all.\n   The statute\u2019s purpose is apparent on its face. It seeks to\nfurther Chapter 11\u2019s basic objectives: (1) \u201cpreserving going\nconcerns\u201d and (2) \u201cmaximizing property available to sat-\nisfy creditors.\u201d Bank of America Nat.

As an important bankruptcy treatise notes, \u201c[i]n\naddition to tax relief, the purpose of the exemption of\n[\u00a71146(a)] is to encourage and facilitate bankruptcy asset\nsales.\u201d 8 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b61146.02, p. 1146\u20133 (15th\ned. rev. 2005). It furthers these objectives where, e.g.,\nasset transfers are at issue, by turning over to the estate\n(for the use of creditors or to facilitate reorganization)\nfunds that otherwise would go to pay state stamp taxes on\nplan-related transferred assets. The requirement that the\ntransfers take place pursuant to a reorganization \u201cplan\u201d\nthat is \u201cconfirmed\u201d provides the bankruptcy judge\u2019s assur-\nance that the transfer meets with creditor approval and\nthe requirements laid out in \u00a71129.\n   How would the majority\u2019s temporal limitation further\nthese statutory objectives? It would not do so in any way.\nFrom the perspective of these purposes, it makes no dif-\nference whether a transfer takes place before or after the\nplan is confirmed. In both instances the exemption puts in\nthe hands of the creditors or the estate money that would\notherwise go to the State in the form of a stamp tax. In\nboth instances the confirmation of the related plan assures\nthe legitimacy (from bankruptcy law\u2019s perspective) of the\nplan that provides for the assets transfer.\n   Moreover, one major reason why a transfer may take\nplace before rather than after a plan is confirmed is that\nthe preconfirmation bankruptcy process takes time.

Thus, an immediate sale can often\nmake more revenue available to creditors or for reorgani-\nzation of the remaining assets. Stamp taxes on related\ntransfers simply reduce the funds available for any such\nlegitimate purposes. And insofar as the Court\u2019s interpre-\ntation of the statute reduces the funds made available,\nthat interpretation inhibits the statute\u2019s efforts to achieve\nits basic objectives.\n   Worse than that, if the potential loss of stamp tax reve-\nnue threatens delay in implementing any such decision to\nsell, then creditors (or the remaining reorganized enter-\nprise) could suffer far more serious harm.

In the present\ncase, for example, Piccadilly, by selling assets quickly after\nstrategic negotiation, realized $80 million, considerably\nmore than the $54 million originally offered before Picca-\ndilly filed for bankruptcy.

Respondent Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., was granted an exemption for assets transferred after it had filed for bankruptcy but before its Chapter 11 plan <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2330</span> was submitted to, and confirmed by, the Bankruptcy Court. Petitioner, the Florida Department of Revenue, seeks reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding the exemption for Piccadilly's asset transfer. Because we hold that \u00a7 1146(a)'s stamp-tax exemption does not apply to transfers made before a plan is confirmed under Chapter 11, we reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Piccadilly was founded in 1944 and was one of the Nation's most successful cafeteria chains until it began experiencing financial difficulties in the last decade. On October 29, 2003, Piccadilly declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, \u00a7 1101 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. V), and requested court authorization to sell substantially all its assets outside the ordinary course of business pursuant to \u00a7 363(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Piccadilly prepared to sell its assets as a going concern and sought an exemption from any stamp taxes on the eventual transfer under \u00a7 1146(a) of the Code.<sup>[1]</sup> The Bankruptcy Court conducted an auction in which the winning bidder agreed to purchase Piccadilly's assets for $80 million.</p>\n<p>On January 26, 2004, as a precondition to the sale, Piccadilly entered into a global settlement agreement with committees of senior secured noteholders and unsecured creditors. The settlement agreement dictated the priority of distribution of the sale proceeds among Piccadilly's creditors. On February 13, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court approved the proposed sale and settlement agreement. The court also ruled that the transfer of assets was exempt from stamp taxes under \u00a7 1146(a). The sale closed on March 16, 2004.</p>\n<p>Piccadilly filed its initial Chapter 11 plan in the Bankruptcy Court on March 26, 2004, and filed an amended plan on July 31, 2004.<sup>[2]</sup> The plan provided for distribution of the sale proceeds in a manner consistent with the settlement agreement. Before the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the plan, Florida filed an objection, seeking a declaration that the $39,200 in stamp taxes it had assessed on certain of Piccadilly's transferred assets fell outside \u00a7 1146(a)'s exemption because the transfer had not been \"under a plan confirmed\" under Chapter 11. On October 21, 2004, the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan. On cross-motions for summary judgment on the stamp-tax issue, the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment in favor <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2331</span> of Piccadilly, reasoning that the sale of substantially all Piccadilly's assets was a transfer \"`under'\" its confirmed plan because the sale was necessary to consummate the plan. App. D to Pet. for Cert. 40a-41a. The District Court upheld the decision on the ground that \u00a7 1146(a), in certain circumstances, affords a stamp-tax exemption even when a transfer occurs prior to confirmation. <i>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1814825\"><a href=\"/opinion/1814825/in-re-piccadilly-cafeterias-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 226 (S.D.Fla.2006).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that \"\u00a7 1146[(a)]'s tax exemption may apply to <i>those</i> pre-confirmation transfers that are necessary to the consummation of a confirmed plan of reorganization, which, at the very least, requires that there be some nexus between the pre-confirmation transfer and the confirmed plan.\" <i>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77649\"><a href=\"/opinion/77649/state-of-florida-dept-of-revenue-v-piccadilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1304 (2007) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Finding the statutory text ambiguous, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u00a7 1146(a) should be interpreted consistent with \"the principle that a remedial statute such as the Bankruptcy Code should be liberally construed.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The court further noted that its interpretation of \u00a7 1146(a) better accounted for \"the practical realities of Chapter 11 reorganization cases\" because a debtor may need to transfer assets to induce relevant parties to endorse the proposed confirmation of a plan. <i>Ibid.</i> The Court of Appeals acknowledged that its holding conflicted with the approach taken by the Courts of Appeals for the Third and Fourth Circuits, <i>id.,</i> at 1302, which have held that \u00a7 1146(a) \"does not apply to ... transactions that occur prior to the confirmation of a plan under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\" <i>In re Hechinger Inv.

Florida asserts that \u00a7 1146(a) applies only to postconfirmation sales; Piccadilly contends that it extends to preconfirmation transfers as long as they are made in accordance with a plan that is eventually confirmed. Florida and Piccadilly base their competing readings of \u00a7 1146(a) on the provision's text, on inferences drawn from other Code provisions, and on substantive canons of statutory construction. We consider each of their arguments in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Florida contends that \u00a7 1146(a)'s text unambiguously limits stamp-tax exemptions to postconfirmation transfers made under the authority of a confirmed plan. It observes that the word \"confirmed\" modifies the word \"plan\" and is a past participle, <i>i.e.,</i> \"[a] verb form indicating past or completed action or time that is used as a verbal adjective in phrases such as <i>baked beans</i> and <i>finished work.\"</i> American Heritage Dictionary 1287 (4th ed.2000). Florida maintains that a past participle indicates past or completed action even when it is placed after the noun it modifies, as in \"beans baked in the oven,\" or \"work finished after midnight.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2332</span> Thus, it argues, the phrase \"plan confirmed\" denotes a \"confirmed plan\"\u0097 meaning one that has been confirmed in the past.</p>\n<p>Florida further contends that the word \"under\" in \"under a plan confirmed\" should be read to mean \"with the authorization of\" or \"inferior or subordinate\" to its referent, here the confirmed plan. See <i>Ardestani v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112665\"><a href=\"/opinion/112665/ardestani-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 135, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991) (noting that a thing that is \"`under'\" a statute is most naturally read as being \"`subject to'\" or \"`governed by'\" the statute). Florida points out that, in the other two appearances of \"under\" in \u00a7 1146(a), it clearly means \"subject to.\" Invoking the textual canon that \"`identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,'\" <i>Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112862\"><a href=\"/opinion/112862/commissioner-v-keystone-consol-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 159, 113 S.Ct. 2006, 124 L.Ed.2d 71 (1993), Florida asserts the term must also have its core meaning of \"subject to\" in the phrase \"under a plan confirmed.\" Florida thus reasons that to be eligible for \u00a7 1146(a)'s exemption, a transfer must be subject to a plan that has been confirmed subject to \u00a7 1129 (2000 ed. and Supp. V). Echoing the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in <i>NVR, supra,</i> at 457, Florida concludes that a transfer made prior to the date of plan confirmation cannot be subject to, or under the authority of, something that did not exist at the time of the transfer\u0097a confirmed plan.</p>\n<p>Piccadilly counters that the statutory language does not unambiguously impose a temporal requirement. It contends that \"plan confirmed\" is not necessarily the equivalent of \"confirmed plan,\" and that had Congress intended the latter, it would have used that language, as it did in a related Code provision. See \u00a7 1142(b) (referring to \"any instrument required to effect a transfer of property dealt with by a confirmed plan\"). Piccadilly also argues that \"under\" is just as easily read to mean \"in accordance with.\" It observes that the variability of the term \"under\" is well-documented, noting that the American Heritage Dictionary 1395 (1976) provides 15 definitions, including \"[i]n view of,\" \"because of,\" \"by virtue of,\" as well as \"[s]ubject to the restraint ... of.\" See also <i>Ardestani, supra,</i> at 135, 112 S.Ct. 515 (recognizing that \"[t]he word `under' has many dictionary definitions and must draw its meaning from its context\"). Although \"under\" appears several times in \u00a7 1146(a), Piccadilly maintains there is no reason why a term of such common usage and variable meaning must have the same meaning each time it is used, even in the same sentence. As an illustration, it points to \u00a7 302(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which states, \"The commencement of a joint case under a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief under such chapter.\" Piccadilly contends that this provision is best read as: \"The commencement of a joint case <i>subject to the provisions of</i> a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief <i>in</i> such chapter.\" Piccadilly thus concludes that the statutory text\u0097standing alone\u0097is susceptible of more than one interpretation. See <i>Hechinger, supra,</i> at 253 (\"[W]e cannot say that the language of [\u00a7 1146(a)] rules out the possibility that `under a plan confirmed' means `in agreement with a plan confirmed'\").</p>\n<p>While both sides present credible interpretations of \u00a7 1146(a), Florida has the better one. To be sure, Congress could have used more precise language\u0097 <i>i.e.,</i> \"under a plan <i>that has been</i> confirmed\"\u0097and thus removed all ambiguity. But the two readings of the language that Congress chose are not equally plausible: Of the two, Florida's is clearly the more natural. The interpretation advanced by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2333</span> Piccadilly and adopted by the Eleventh Circuit\u0097that there must be \"some nexus between the pre-confirmation transfer and the confirmed plan\" for \u00a7 1146(a) to apply, 484 F.3d, at 1304\u0097places greater strain on the statutory text than the simpler construction advanced by Florida and adopted by the Third and Fourth Circuits.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Piccadilly's emphasis on the distinction between \"plan confirmed\" and \"confirmed plan\" is unavailing because \u00a7 1146(a) specifies not only that a tax-exempt transfer be \"under a plan,\" but also that the plan in question be confirmed pursuant to \u00a71129. Congress' placement of \"plan confirmed\" before \"under section 1129\" avoids the ambiguity that would have arisen had it used the term \"confirmed plan,\" which could easily be read to mean that the transfer must be \"under section 1129\" rather than under a plan that was itself confirmed under \u00a7 1129.</p>\n<p>Although we agree with Florida that the more natural reading of \u00a7 1146(a) is that the exemption applies only to postconfirmation transfers, ultimately we need not decide whether the statute is unambiguous on its face. Even assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the language of \u00a7 1146(a) is facially ambiguous, the ambiguity must be resolved in Florida's favor. We reach this conclusion after considering the parties' other arguments, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Piccadilly insists that, whatever the degree of ambiguity on its face, \u00a7 1146(a) becomes even more ambiguous when read in context with other Bankruptcy Code provisions. Piccadilly asserts that if Congress had intended \u00a7 1146(a) to apply exclusively to transfers occurring after confirmation, it would have made its intent plain with an express temporal limitation similar to those appearing elsewhere in the Code. For example, \u00a7 1127 governs modifications to a Chapter 11 plan, providing that the proponent of a plan may modify the plan \"at any time before confirmation,\" or, subject to certain restrictions, \"at any time after confirmation of such plan.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1127(a)-(b). Similar examples abound. See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7 1104(a) (\"[a]t any time after the commencement of the case but before confirmation of a plan ...\"); \u00a7 1104(c) (\"[a]t any time before the confirmation of a plan ...\"). Piccadilly emphasizes that, \"where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\" <i>Russello v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Congress did not impose a clear and commonly used temporal limitation in \u00a7 1146(a), Piccadilly concludes that Congress did not intend one to exist. Piccadilly buttresses its conclusion by pointing out that \u00a7 1146(b)\u0097the subsection immediately following \u00a7 1146(a)\u0097includes an express temporal limitation. See \u00a7 1146(b) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (providing that a bankruptcy court may declare certain tax consequences after the date a government unit responds to a plan proponent's request or \"270 days after such request,\" whichever is earlier). But Congress included no such limitation in subsection (a).</p>\n<p>Piccadilly also relies on other Code provisions to bolster its argument that the term \"under\" preceding \"a plan confirmed\" in \u00a7 1146(a) should be read broadly\u0097to mean \"in accordance with\" rather than the narrower \"authorized by.\" Apart from \u00a7 302, discussed above, Piccadilly adverts to \u00a7 111, which states that an agency providing credit counseling to debtors is required to meet \"the standards set forth under this section.\" \u00a7 111(b)(4)(A) (2000 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2334</span> ed., Supp. V). Piccadilly argues that this language requires the agency to meet \"the standards set forth <i>in</i> this section,\" because reading the quoted language to mean \"the standards set forth <i>authorized by</i> this section\" would render the words \"set forth\" nonsensical. Piccadilly additionally refers to \u00a7 303(a), which provides that \"[a]n involuntary case may be commenced only under chapter 7 or 11 of this title.\" Again, Piccadilly asserts that this language means \"an involuntary case may be commenced only <i>in</i> chapter 7 or 11 of this title.\" It reasons that \"under\" in \u00a7 303(a) cannot mean \"authorized by\" because \u00a7 303(a) itself authorizes involuntary cases, and the provisions of Chapters 7 and 11 do not. Piccadilly makes a similar argument with respect to \u00a7 343, which provides that \"[t]he debtor shall appear and submit to examination under oath at the meeting of creditors.\" Reading \"under\" to mean \"authorized by\" would make little sense here. On the basis of these examples, Piccadilly concludes that the term \"under\" is ambiguous.</p>\n<p>Finally, Piccadilly maintains that \"under\" in \u00a7 1146(a) should be construed broadly in light of \u00a7 365(g)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides that rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease constitutes the equivalent of a prebankruptcy breach \"if such contract or lease has not been assumed under this section or under a plan confirmed under chapter ... 11.\" In <i>Hechinger,</i> the Third Circuit concluded that substituting \"authorized by\" for \"under\" in \u00a7 1146(a) would be consistent with the use of the parallel language in \u00a7 365(g)(1). 335 F.3d, at 254. Piccadilly attempts to refute <i>Hechinger's</i> reading of \u00a7 365(g)(1), asserting that, because authorization for the assumption of a lease under a plan is described in \u00a7 1123(b)(2), which \"circles back to section 365,\" such authorization cannot be \"subject to\" or \"authorized by\" Chapter 11. Brief for Respondent 39 (emphasis deleted); see 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1123(b)(2) (providing that \"a plan may ... subject to section 365 of this title, provide for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor not previously rejected under such section\"). The phrase \"under a plan confirmed\" in \u00a7 365(g)(1), contends Piccadilly, is thus best read to mean \"<i>in accordance with</i> a plan confirmed\" because a plan may provide for the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease but not\u0097unlike \u00a7 365\u0097be the ultimate authority for that assumption. As a result, Piccadilly concludes that the identical language of \u00a7 1146(a) should have the same meaning.</p>\n<p>Piccadilly supports this point with its assertion that, unlike sales, postconfirmation assumptions or rejections are not permitted under the Bankruptcy Code. See <i>NLRB v. Bildisco &amp; Bildisco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111108\"><a href=\"/opinion/111108/nlrb-v-bildisco-bildisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 529, 104 S.Ct. 1188, 79 L.Ed.2d 482 (1984) (stating that in \"a Chapter 11 reorganization, a debtor-in-possession has until a reorganization plan is confirmed to decide whether to accept or reject an executory contract\"). Because, as Piccadilly contends, the phrase \"under a plan confirmed under chapter ... 11\" in \u00a7 365(g)(1) cannot refer to assumptions or rejections occurring after confirmation, it would be anomalous to read the identical phrase in \u00a7 1146(a) to cover <i>only</i> postconfirmation transfers.</p>\n<p>For its part, Florida argues that the statutory context of \u00a7 1146(a) supports its position that the stamp-tax exemption applies exclusively to postconfirmation transfers. It observes that the subchapter in which \u00a7 1146(a) appears is entitled, \"POSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS.\" Florida contends that, while not dispositive, the placement of a provision in a particular subchapter suggests that its terms should be interpreted consistent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2335</span> with that subchapter. See <i>Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112227\"><a href=\"/opinion/112227/davis-v-michigan-dept-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span>, 809, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989) (\"It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme\"). In addition, Florida dismisses Piccadilly's references to the temporal limitations in other Code provisions on the ground that it would have been superfluous for Congress to add any further limitations to \u00a7 1146(a)'s already unambiguous temporal element.</p>\n<p>Even on the assumption that the text of \u00a7 1146(a) is ambiguous, we are not persuaded by Piccadilly's contextual arguments. As noted above, Congress could have used language that made \u00a7 1146(a)'s temporal element clear beyond question. Unlike \u00a7 1146(a), however, the temporal language examples quoted by Piccadilly are indispensable to the operative meaning of the provisions in which they appear. Piccadilly's reliance on \u00a7 1127, for example, is misplaced because that section explicitly differentiates between preconfirmation modifications, see \u00a7 1127(a), and postconfirmation modifications, which are permissible \"only if circumstances warrant\" them, \u00a7 1127(b). It was unnecessary for Congress to include in \u00a7 1146(a) a phrase such as \"at any time after confirmation of such plan\" because the phrase \"under a plan confirmed\" is most naturally read to require that there be a confirmed plan at the time of the transfer.</p>\n<p>Even if we were to adopt Piccadilly's broad definition of \"under,\" its interpretation of the statute faces other obstacles. The asset transfer here can hardly be said to have been consummated \"in accordance with\" any confirmed plan because, as of the closing date, Piccadilly had not even submitted its plan to the Bankruptcy Court for confirmation. Piccadilly's asset sale was thus not conducted \"in accordance with\" any plan confirmed under Chapter 11. Rather, it was conducted \"in accordance with\" the procedures set forth in Chapter 3\u0097specifically, \u00a7 363(b)(1). To read the statute as Piccadilly proposes would make \u00a7 1146(a)'s exemption turn on whether a debtor-in-possession's actions are consistent with a legal instrument that does not exist\u0097and indeed may not even be conceived of\u0097at the time of the sale. Reading \u00a7 1146(a) in context with other relevant Code provisions, we find nothing justifying such a curious interpretation of what is a straightforward exemption.</p>\n<p>Nor does anything in \u00a7 365(g)(1) recommend Piccadilly's reading of \u00a7 1146(a). Section 365(g) generally allows a trustee to reject \"an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,\" <i>i.e.,</i> to reject a contract that is unfavorable to the estate, subject to court approval. As the text makes clear, such approval may occur either under \"this section,\" \u00a7 365(g)\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> \"at any time before the confirmation of a plan,\" \u00a7 365(d)(2)\u0097or \"under a plan confirmed under chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13,\" \u00a7 365(g)(1). Piccadilly relies heavily on <i>Bildisco, supra,</i> in which this Court held that \u00a7 365 permits a debtor-in-possession to reject a collective-bargaining agreement like any other executory contract, and that doing so is not an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act. In reaching this conclusion, the Court observed that \"a debtor-in-possession has until a reorganization plan is confirmed <i>to decide</i> whether to accept or reject an executory contract.\" 465 U.S., at 529, 104 S.Ct. 1188 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>We agree with <i>Bildisco's</i> commonsense observation that the <i>decision</i> whether to reject a contract or lease must be made before confirmation. But that in no way undermines the fact that the rejection takes <i>effect</i> upon or after confirmation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2336</span> of the Chapter 11 plan (or before confirmation if pursuant to \u00a7 365(d)(2)). In the context of \u00a7 1146(a), the decision whether to transfer a given asset \"under a plan confirmed\" must be made prior to submitting the Chapter 11 plan to the bankruptcy court, but the transfer itself cannot be \"under a plan confirmed\" until the court confirms the plan in question. Only at that point does the transfer become eligible for the stamp-tax exemption.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>If the statutory context suggests anything, it is that \u00a7 1146(a) is inapplicable to preconfirmation transfers. We find it informative that Congress placed \u00a7 1146(a) in a subchapter entitled, \"POSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS.\" To be sure, a subchapter heading cannot substitute for the operative text of the statute. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118228\"><a href=\"/opinion/118228/pennsylvania-dept-of-corrections-v-yeskey/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 212, 118 S.Ct. 1952, 141 L.Ed.2d 215 (1998) (\"`[T]he title of a statute ... cannot limit the plain meaning of the text'\"). Nonetheless, statutory titles and section headings \"`are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.'\" <i>Porter v. Nussle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118483\"><a href=\"/opinion/118483/porter-v-nussle/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span>, 528, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002). The placement of \u00a7 1146(a) within a subchapter expressly limited to postconfirmation matters undermines Piccadilly's view that \u00a7 1146(a) covers preconfirmation transfers.</p>\n<p>But even if we were fully to accept Piccadilly's textual and contextual arguments, they would establish at most that the statutory language is ambiguous. They do not\u0097and largely are not intended to\u0097demonstrate that \u00a7 1146(a)'s purported ambiguity should be resolved in Piccadilly's favor. Florida argues that various nontextual canons of construction require us to resolve any ambiguity in its favor. Piccadilly responds with substantive canons of its own. It is to these dueling canons of construction that we now turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Florida contends that even if the statutory text is deemed ambiguous, applicable substantive canons compel its interpretation of \u00a7 1146(a). Florida first invokes the canon that \"Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it reenacts a statute without change.\" <i>Lorillard v. Pons,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109777\"><a href=\"/opinion/109777/lorillard-v-pons/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 580-581, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978). Florida observes that the relevant language of \u00a7 1146(a) relating to \"under a plan confirmed\" has remained unchanged since 1978 despite several revisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The most recent revision in 2005 occurred after the Fourth Circuit's decision in <i>NVR</i> and the Third Circuit's decision in <i>Hechinger</i> but before the Eleventh Circuit's decision below. Florida asserts that Congress ratified this longstanding interpretation when, in its most recent amendments to the Code, it \"readopted\" the stamp-tax provision verbatim as \u00a7 1146(a). Brief for Petitioner 26.</p>\n<p>Florida also invokes the substantive canon\u0097on which the Third Circuit relied in <i>Hechinger</i>\u0097that courts should \"`proceed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2337</span> carefully when asked to recognize an exemption from state taxation that Congress has not clearly expressed.'\" 335 F.3d, at 254 (quoting <i>California State Bd. of Equalization v. Sierra Summit, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112279\"><a href=\"/opinion/112279/california-state-bd-of-equalization-v-sierra-summi/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>, 851-852, 109 S.Ct. 2228, 104 L.Ed.2d 910 (1989)). In light of this directive, Florida contends that \u00a7 1146(a)'s language must be construed strictly in favor of the States to prevent unwarranted displacement of their tax laws. See <i>National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117961\"><a href=\"/opinion/117961/national-private-truck-council-inc-v-oklahoma-tax-/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span>, 590, 115 S.Ct. 2351, 132 L.Ed.2d 509 (1995) (discussing principles of comity in taxation and the \"federal reluctance to interfere with state taxation\" given the \"strong background presumption against interference\").</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Florida notes that the canon also discourages federal interference with the administration of a State's taxation scheme. See <i>id.,</i> at 586, 590, 115 S.Ct. 2351. Florida contends that the Court of Appeals' extension of \u00a7 1146(a) to preconfirmation transfers directly interferes with the administration of the State's stamp tax, which is imposed \"prior to recordation\" of the instrument of transfer. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 201.01, 201.02(1) (2006). Extending the exemption to transfers that occurred months or years before a confirmable plan even existed, Florida explains, may require the States to \"`unravel'\" stamp taxes already collected. Brief for Petitioner 31. Alternatively, should a court grant an exemption under \u00a7 1146(a) before confirmation, States would be saddled with the task of monitoring whether the plan is ever eventually confirmed.</p>\n<p>In response, Piccadilly contends that the federalism principle articulated in <i>Sierra Summit, supra,</i> at 852, 109 S.Ct. 2228, does not apply where there is a \"clear expression of an exemption from state taxation\" overriding a State's authority to tax. In Piccadilly's view, that is precisely the case with regard to \u00a7 1146(a), which proscribes the imposition of stamp taxes and demonstrates Congress' intent to exempt a category of state taxation.</p>\n<p>Piccadilly further maintains that Florida's stamp tax is nothing more than a postpetition claim, specifically an administrative expense, which is paid as a priority claim ahead of the prepetition claims of most creditors. Equating Florida's receipt of tax revenue with a preference in favor of a particular claimant, Piccadilly argues that \u00a7 1146(a)'s ambiguous exemption should not be construed to diminish other claimants' recoveries. See <i>Howard Delivery Service, Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145644\"><a href=\"/opinion/145644/howard-delivery-service-inc-v-zurich-american-ins-/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 667, 126 S.Ct. 2105, 165 L.Ed.2d 110 (2006) (emphasizing that \"provisions allowing preferences must be tightly construed\"). Reading the stamp-tax exemption too narrowly, Piccadilly maintains, \"`is not only inconsistent with the policy of equality of distribution'\" but also \"`dilutes the value of the priority for those creditors Congress intended to prefer'\"\u0097those with prepetition claims. Brief for Respondent 54 (quoting <i>Howard Delivery Serv., supra,</i> at 667, 126 S.Ct. 2105).</p>\n<p>Above all, Piccadilly urges us to adopt the Court of Appeals' maxim that \"a remedial statute such as the Bankruptcy Code should be liberally construed.\" 484 F.3d, at 1304; cf. <i>Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105023\"><a href=\"/opinion/105023/isbrandtsen-co-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">779</span></a></span>, 782, 72 S.Ct. 1011, 96 L.Ed. 1294 (1952). In Piccadilly's view, any ambiguity in the statutory text is overshadowed by \u00a7 1146(a)'s obvious purpose: to facilitate the Chapter 11 process \"through giving tax relief.\" <i>In re Jacoby-Bender, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450381\"><a href=\"/opinion/450381/bankr-l-rep-p-70357-in-re-jacoby-bender-inc-debtor/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></a></span>, 841 (C.A.2 1985). Piccadilly characterizes the tax on asset transfers at issue here as tantamount to a levy on the bankruptcy process itself. A stamp tax like Florida's makes the sale of a debtor's property more expensive and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2338</span> reduces the total proceeds available to satisfy the creditors' claims, contrary to Congress' clear intent in enacting \u00a7 1146(a).</p>\n<p>What is unclear, Piccadilly argues, is why \"Congress would have intended the anomaly that a transfer essential to a plan that occurs two minutes before confirmation may be taxed, but the same transfer occurring two seconds after may not.\" Brief for Respondent 43. After all, interpreting \u00a7 1146(a) in the manner Florida proposes would lead precisely to that result. And that, Piccadilly asserts, is \"absurd\" in light of \u00a7 1146(a)'s policy aim\u0097 evidenced by the provision's text and legislative history\u0097of reducing the cost of asset transfers. In that vein, Piccadilly contends that interpreting \u00a7 1146(a) to apply solely to postconfirmation transfers would undermine Chapter 11's twin objectives of \"preserving going concerns and maximizing property available to satisfy creditors.\" <i>Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn. v. 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118285\"><a href=\"/opinion/118285/bank-of-america-nat-trust-and-sav-assn-v-203-north/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 453, 119 S.Ct. 1411, 143 L.Ed.2d 607 (1999). In order to obtain the maximum value for its assets\u0097especially assets rapidly declining in value\u0097Piccadilly claims that a debtor often must close the sale before formal confirmation of the Chapter 11 plan.</p>\n<p>We agree with Florida that the federalism canon articulated in <i>Sierra Summit</i> and elsewhere obliges us to construe \u00a7 1146(a)'s exemption narrowly. Piccadilly's effort to evade the canon falls well short of the mark because reading \u00a7 1146(a) in the manner Piccadilly proposes would require us to do exactly what the canon counsels against. If we recognized an exemption for preconfirmation transfers, we would in effect be \"`recogniz[ing] an exemption from state taxation that <i>Congress has not clearly expressed</i>'\"\u0097namely, an exemption for preconfirmation transfers. <i>Sierra Summit,</i> 490 U.S., at 851-852, 109 S.Ct. 2228 (emphasis added); see also <i>Swarts v. Hammer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96106\"><a href=\"/opinion/96106/swarts-v-hammer/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span>, 444, 24 S.Ct. 695, 48 L.Ed. 1060 (1904) (reasoning that if Congress endeavored to exempt a debtor from state and local taxation, \"the intention would be clearly expressed, not left to be collected or inferred from disputable considerations of convenience in administering the estate of the bankrupt\"). Indeed, Piccadilly proves precisely this point by resting its entire case on the premise that Congress has expressed its stamp-tax exemption in ambiguous language. Therefore, far from being inapposite, the canon is decisive in this case.</p>\n<p>The canons on which Piccadilly relies are inapposite. While we agree with Piccadilly that \"provisions allowing preferences must be tightly construed,\" <i>Howard Delivery Serv., supra,</i> at 667, 126 S.Ct. 2105, \u00a7 1146(a) is not a preference-granting provision. The statutory text makes no mention of preferences.</p>\n<p>Nor are we persuaded that in this case we should construe \u00a7 1146(a) \"liberally\" to serve its ostensibly \"remedial\" purpose. Based on the Eleventh Circuit's declaration that the Bankruptcy Code is a \"remedial statute,\" Piccadilly would stretch the disallowance well beyond what the statutory text can naturally bear. Apart from the opinion below, however, the only authority Piccadilly offers is a 1952 decision of this Court interpreting the Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872. See Brief for Respondent 54 (citing <i>Isbrandtsen, supra,</i> at 782, 72 S.Ct. 1011). But unlike the statutory scheme in <i>Isbrandtsen,</i> which was \"`designed to secure the comfort and health of seamen aboard ship, hospitalization at home and care abroad,'\" 343 U.S., at 784, 72 S.Ct. 1011 (quoting <i>Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co. of N. J.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103817\"><a href=\"/opinion/103817/aguilar-v-standard-oil-co-of-nj/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span>, 728, 63 S.Ct. 930, 87 L.Ed. 1107 (1943)), the Bankruptcy Code\u0097and Chapter 11 in particular\u0097is not a remedial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2339</span> statute in that sense. To the contrary, this Court has rejected the notion that \"Congress had a single purpose in enacting Chapter 11.\" <i>Toibb v. Radloff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112621\"><a href=\"/opinion/112621/toibb-v-radloff/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 163, 111 S.Ct. 2197, 115 L.Ed.2d 145 (1991). Rather, Chapter 11 strikes a balance between a debtor's interest in reorganizing and restructuring its debts and the creditors' interest in maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate. <i>Ibid.</i> The Code also accommodates the interests of the States in regulating property transfers by \"`generally [leaving] the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt's estate to state law.'\" <i>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co.,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1199, 1205, 167 L.Ed.2d 178 (2007). Such interests often do not coincide, and in this case, they clearly do not. We therefore decline to construe the exemption granted by \u00a7 1146(a) to the detriment of the State.</p>\n<p>As for Piccadilly's assertion that reading \u00a7 1146(a) to allow preconfirmation transfers to be taxed while exempting others moments later would amount to an \"absurd\" policy, we reiterate that \"`it is not for us to substitute our view of ... policy for the legislation which has been passed by Congress.'\" <i>Hechinger,</i> 335 F.3d, at 256. That said, we see no absurdity in reading \u00a7 1146(a) as setting forth a simple, bright-line rule instead of the complex, after-the-fact inquiry Piccadilly envisions. At bottom, we agree with the Fourth Circuit's summation of \u00a7 1146(a):</p>\n<blockquote>\"Congress struck a most reasonable balance. If a debtor is able to develop a Chapter 11 reorganization and obtain confirmation, then the debtor is to be afforded relief from certain taxation to facilitate the implementation of the reorganization plan. Before a debtor reaches this point, however, the state and local tax systems may not be subjected to federal interference.\" <i>NVR,</i> 189 F.3d, at 458.</blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, to the extent the \"practical realities\" of Chapter 11 reorganizations are increasingly rendering postconfirmation transfers a thing of the past, see 484 F.3d, at 1304, it is incumbent upon the Legislature, and not the Judiciary, to determine whether \u00a7 1146(a) is in need of revision. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 831, 841, 169 L.Ed.2d 680 (2008) (\"We are not at liberty to rewrite the statute to reflect a meaning we deem more desirable\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The most natural reading of \u00a7 1146(a)'s text, the provision's placement within the Code, and applicable substantive canons all lead to the same conclusion: Section 1146(a) affords a stamp-tax exemption only to transfers made pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan that has been confirmed. Because Piccadilly transferred its assets before its Chapter 11 plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it may not rely on \u00a7 1146(a) to avoid Florida's stamp taxes. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Bankruptcy Code provides that the \"transfer\" of an asset \"<i>under a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title,</i> may not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.\" 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1146(a) (2000 ed., Supp V) (previously \u00a7 1146(c)) (emphasis added). In this case, the debtor's reorganization \"plan\" provides for the \"transfer\" of assets. But the \"plan\" itself was not \"confirmed under section 1129 of this title\" (<i>i.e.,</i> the Bankruptcy Judge did not formally approve the plan) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2340</span> until <i>after</i> the \"transfer\" of assets took place. See \u00a7 1129 (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (detailing the requirements for bankruptcy court approval of a Chapter 11 plan).</p>\n<p>Hence we must ask whether the time of transfer matters. Do the statutory words \"under a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title\" apply only where a transfer takes place \"under a plan\" that at the time of the transfer <i>already has been</i> \"confirmed under section 1129 of this title\"? Or, do they also apply where a transfer takes place \"under a plan\" that <i>subsequently is</i> \"confirmed under section 1129 of this title\"? The Court concludes that the statutory phrase applies only where a transfer takes place \"under a plan\" that at the time of transfer <i>already has been</i> \"confirmed under section 1129 of this title.\" In my view, however, the statutory phrase applies \"under a plan\" that at the time of transfer either <i>already has been</i> or <i>subsequently is</i> \"confirmed.\" In a word, the majority believes that the time (pre- or post-transfer) at which the bankruptcy judge confirms the reorganization plan matters. I believe that it does not. (And construing the provision to refer to a plan that simply \"is\" confirmed would require us to read fewer words into the statute than the Court's construction, which reads the provision to refer only to a plan \"that has been\" confirmed, <i>ante,</i> at 2339.)</p>\n<p>The statutory language itself is perfectly ambiguous on the point. Linguistically speaking, it is no more difficult to apply the words \"plan confirmed\" to instances in which the \"plan\" <i>subsequently is</i> \"confirmed\" than to restrict their application to instances in which the \"plan\" <i>already has been</i> \"confirmed.\" See <i>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77649\"><a href=\"/opinion/77649/state-of-florida-dept-of-revenue-v-piccadilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1304 (C.A.11 2007) <i>(per curiam)</i> (\"[T]he statute can plausibly be read either as describing eligible transfers to include transfers `under a plan confirmed' regardless of <i>when</i> the plan is confirmed, <i>or</i> ... imposing a temporal restriction on when the confirmation of the plan must occur\" (emphasis in original)).

But cf. <i>ante,</i> at 2332-2333 (majority believes its reading is \"clearly the more natural\").</p>\n<p>Nor can I find any text-based argument that points clearly in one direction rather than the other. Indeed, the majority, after methodically combing the textualist beaches, finds that a comparison with other somewhat similar phrases in the Bankruptcy Code sheds little light. For example, on the one hand, if Congress thought the time of confirmation mattered, why did it not say so expressly as it has done elsewhere in the Code? See, <i>e.g.,</i> 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127(b) (plan proponent may modify it \"at any time <i>after</i> confirmation\" (emphasis added)); \u00a7 1104(a) (\"[a]t any time after the commencement of the case but <i>before</i> confirmation\" (emphasis added)); \u00a7 1104(c) (\"at any time <i>before</i> the confirmation of a plan\" (emphasis added)); \u00a7 1114(e)(2) (\"<i>before</i> a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title is effective\" (emphasis added)). On the other hand, if Congress thought the time of confirmation did <i>not</i> matter, why did it place this provision in a subchapter entitled \"POSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS\"? See 11 U.S.C., ch. 11, subch. III. (And yet one could also argue that the tax exemption provision appears under the \"postconfirmation matters\" title because the trigger for the exemption is plan confirmation. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2341</span> Thus, the exemption is a \"postconfirmation matter,\" regardless of when the transfer occurs.)</p>\n<p>The canons of interpretation offer little help. And the majority, for the most part, seems to agree. It ultimately rests its interpretive conclusion upon this Court's statement that courts \"must proceed carefully when asked to recognize an exemption from state taxation that Congress has not clearly expressed.\" <i>California State Bd. of Equalization v. Sierra Summit, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112279\"><a href=\"/opinion/112279/california-state-bd-of-equalization-v-sierra-summi/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>, 851-852, 109 S.Ct. 2228, 104 L.Ed.2d 910 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). See <i>ante,</i> at 2338. But when, as here, we interpret a provision the <i>express point of which</i> is to exempt some category of state taxation, how can the statement in <i>Sierra Summit</i> prove determinative? See \u00a7 1146(a) (\"The issuance, transfer, or exchange of a security, or the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title, <i>may not be taxed</i> under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>Neither does Florida's related claim, protesting federal interference in the <i>administration</i> of a State's taxation scheme seem plausible. See Brief for Petitioner 32-33 (noting the \"additional difficulties and complexities that will proliferate\" under the lower court's decision). <i>If</i> Florida now requires transferees to file a <i>pre-existing</i> confirmed plan in order to avoid payment of the stamp tax, then why could Florida not require a transferee under a not-yet-confirmed plan to pay the stamp tax and then file the plan after its confirmation in order to obtain a refund? (If there is some other, less curable, practical problem, Florida has not explained what it is.) Given these difficulties, I suspect that the majority's reliance upon <i>Sierra Summit</i>'s \"canon,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2336-2337, reflects no more than an effort to find the proverbial \"any port\" in this interpretive storm.</p>\n<p>The absence of a clear answer in text or canons, however, should not lead us to judicial despair. Consistent with Court precedent, we can and should ask a further question: <i>Why</i> would Congress have insisted upon temporal limits? What reasonable <i>purpose</i> might such limits serve? See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Dolan v. Postal Service,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145678\"><a href=\"/opinion/145678/dolan-v-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span>, 486, 126 S.Ct. 1252, 163 L.Ed.2d 1079 (2006) (\"Interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, <i>considering the purpose</i> and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis\" (emphasis added)); <i>Robinson v.

In fact, the majority's reading of temporal limits in \u00a7 1146(a) serves <i>no reasonable congressional purpose at all.</i></p>\n<p>The statute's purpose is apparent on its face. It seeks to further Chapter 11's basic objectives: (1) \"preserving going concerns\" and (2) \"maximizing property available to satisfy creditors.\" <i>Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav.

As an important bankruptcy treatise notes, \"[i]n addition to tax relief, the purpose of the exemption of [\u00a7 1146(a)] is to encourage and facilitate bankruptcy asset sales.\" 8 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1146.02, p. 1146-3 (15th ed. rev.2005). It furthers these objectives where, <i>e.g.,</i> asset transfers are at issue, by turning over to the estate (for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2342</span> the use of creditors or to facilitate reorganization) funds that otherwise would go to pay state stamp taxes on plan-related transferred assets. The requirement that the transfers take place pursuant to a reorganization \"plan\" that is \"confirmed\" provides the bankruptcy judge's assurance that the transfer meets with creditor approval and the requirements laid out in \u00a7 1129.</p>\n<p>How would the majority's temporal limitation further these statutory objectives? It would not do so in any way. From the perspective of these purposes, it makes no difference whether a transfer takes place before or after the plan is confirmed. In both instances the exemption puts in the hands of the creditors or the estate money that would otherwise go to the State in the form of a stamp tax. In both instances the confirmation of the related plan assures the legitimacy (from bankruptcy law's perspective) of the plan that provides for the assets transfer.</p>\n<p>Moreover, one major reason why a transfer may take place <i>before</i> rather than <i>after</i> a plan is confirmed is that the preconfirmation bankruptcy process takes time.

And a firm (or its assets) may have more value (say, as a going concern) where sale takes place quickly.

Thus, an immediate sale can often make more revenue available to creditors or for reorganization of the remaining assets. Stamp taxes on related transfers simply reduce the funds available for any such legitimate purposes. And insofar as the Court's interpretation of the statute reduces the funds made available, that interpretation inhibits the statute's efforts to achieve its basic objectives.</p>\n<p>Worse than that, if the potential loss of stamp tax revenue threatens delay in implementing any such decision to sell, then creditors (or the remaining reorganized enterprise) could suffer far more serious harm. They could lose the extra revenues that a speedy sale might otherwise produce. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>In re Met-L-Wood Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514621\"><a href=\"/opinion/514621/in-the-matter-of-met-l-wood-corporation-debtor-app/\"><span class=\"volume\">861</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1012</span></a></span>, 1017 (C.A.7 1988) (as suppliers and customers \"shy away,\" it can make sense quickly to sell business to other owners so that it \"can continue\" to operate \"free of the stigma and uncertainty of bankruptcy\"). In the present case, for example, Piccadilly, by selling assets quickly after strategic negotiation, realized $80 million, considerably more than the $54 million originally offered before Piccadilly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2343</span> filed for bankruptcy. That fact, along with the Bankruptcy Court's finding of \"sound business reasons\" for the prompt sale of Piccadilly's assets and that the expeditious sale was \"in the best interests of creditors of [Piccadilly] and other parties in interest,\" App. 32a, suggest that considerably less would have been available for creditors had Piccadilly waited until after the plan's confirmation to execute the sale plan.</p>\n<p>What conceivable reason could Congress have had for silently writing into the statute's language a temporal distinction with such consequences? The majority can find none. It simply says that the result is not \"`absurd'\" and notes the advantages of a \"bright-line rule.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2339. I agree that the majority's interpretation is not absurd and do not dispute the advantages of a clear rule. But I think the statute supplies a clear enough rule\u0097transfers are exempt when there is confirmation and are not exempt when there is no confirmation. And I see no reason to adopt the majority's preferred construction (that only transfers completed after plan confirmation are exempt), where it conflicts with the statute's purpose.</p>\n<p>Of course, we should not substitute \"`\"<i>our view</i> of ... policy\"'\" for the statute that Congress enacted. <i>Ante,</i> at 2339 (emphasis added). But we certainly should consider <i>Congress'</i> view of the policy for the statute it created, and that view inheres in the statute's purpose. \"Statutory interpretation is not a game of blind man's bluff. Judges are free to consider statutory language in light of a statute's basic purposes.\" <i>Dole Food Co. v.

It is the majority's failure to work with this important tool of statutory interpretation that has led it to construe the present statute in a way that, in my view, runs contrary to what Congress would have hoped for and expected.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  When litigation commenced in the lower courts, the stamp-tax exemption was contained in \u00a7 1146(c) (2000 ed.). In 2005, Congress repealed subsections (a) and (b), and the stamp-tax exemption was recodified as \u00a7 1146(a). See Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, \u00a7 719(b)(3), 119 Stat. 133. For simplicity, we will cite the provision as it is currently codified.</p>\n<p>[2]  Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings ordinarily culminate in the confirmation of a reorganization plan. But in some cases, as here, a debtor sells all or substantially all its assets under \u00a7 363(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) before seeking or receiving plan confirmation. In this scenario, the debtor typically submits for confirmation a plan of liquidation (rather than a traditional plan of reorganization) providing for the distribution of the proceeds resulting from the sale. Here, Piccadilly filed a Chapter 11 liquidation plan after selling substantially all its assets as a going concern. Although the central purpose of Chapter 11 is to facilitate reorganizations rather than liquidations (covered generally by Chapter 7), Chapter 11 expressly contemplates liquidations. See \u00a7 1129(a)(11) (2000 ed.) (\"Confirmation of the plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganization, of the debtor or any successor to the debtor under the plan, unless such liquidation or reorganization is proposed in the plan\").</p>\n<p>[3]  Also meritless is Piccadilly's argument that \"under\" in the phrase \"under a plan confirmed under chapter ... 11\" in \u00a7 365(g)(1) cannot be read to mean \"subject to\" because \u00a7 1123(b)(2), in Piccadilly's words, \"circles back to section 365.\" Brief for Respondent 39. Section 1123(b)(2) authorizes a plan to provide for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease, but requires that the plan do so in a manner consistent with the various requirements set forth throughout \u00a7 365. By contrast, the phrase \"under this section\" in \u00a7 365(g)(1) serves as a reference to \u00a7 365(d)(2), which permits preconfirmation assumptions and rejections pursuant to a court order (and not, as in \u00a7 1123(b)(2), pursuant to a confirmed plan).</p>\n\n</div>",
