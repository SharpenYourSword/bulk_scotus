Heytens, Assistant to the Solicitor General, Donald E. Keener, Quynh Bain, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We decide in this case whether an alien who has requested and been granted voluntary departure from the United States, a form of discretionary relief that avoids certain statutory penalties, must adhere to that election and depart within the time prescribed, even if doing so causes the alien to forgo a ruling on a pending, unresolved motion to reopen the removal proceedings. The case turns upon the interaction of relevant provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (IIRIRA or Act). The Act provides that every alien ordered removed from the United States has a right to file one motion to reopen his or her removal proceedings. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The statute also provides, however, that if the alien's request for voluntary departure is granted after he or she is found removable, the alien is required to depart within the period prescribed by immigration officials, which cannot exceed 60 days. See \u00a7 1229c(b)(2) (2000 ed.). Failure to depart within the prescribed period renders the alien ineligible for certain forms of relief, including adjustment of status, for a period of 10 years. \u00a7 1229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Pursuant to regulation, however, departure has the effect of withdrawing the motion to reopen. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(d) (2007).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2311</span> Without some means, consistent with the Act, to reconcile the two commands \u0097 one directing voluntary departure and the other directing termination of the motion to reopen if an alien departs the United States \u0097 an alien who seeks reopening has two poor choices: The alien can remain in the United States to ensure the motion to reopen remains pending, while incurring statutory penalties for overstaying the voluntary departure date; or the alien can avoid penalties by prompt departure but abandon the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p>The issue is whether Congress intended the statutory right to reopen to be qualified by the voluntary departure process. The alien, who is petitioner here, urges that filing a motion to reopen tolls the voluntary departure period pending the motion's disposition. We reject this interpretation because it would reconfigure the voluntary departure scheme in a manner inconsistent with the statutory design. We do not have the authority to interpret the statute as petitioner suggests. Still, the conflict between the right to file a motion to reopen and the provision requiring voluntary departure no later than 60 days remains untenable if these are the only two choices available to the alien. Absent a valid regulation resolving the dilemma in a different way, we conclude the alien must be permitted an opportunity to withdraw the motion for voluntary departure, provided the request is made before the departure period expires. Petitioner attempted to avail himself of this opportunity below. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did not disturb the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA or Board) denial of petitioner's request to withdraw the voluntary departure election. We now reverse its decision and remand the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Samson Taiwo Dada, a native and citizen of Nigeria, came to the United States in April 1998 on a temporary nonimmigrant visa. He overstayed it. In 1999, petitioner alleges, he married an American citizen. Petitioner's wife filed an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative on his behalf. The necessary documentary evidence was not provided, however, and the petition was denied in February 2003.</p>\n<p>In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) charged petitioner with being removable under \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 201, as amended, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) (2000 ed., Supp. V), for overstaying his visa. Petitioner's wife then filed a second I-130 petition. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied petitioner's request for a continuance pending adjudication of the newly filed I-130 petition and noted that those petitions take an average of about three years to process. The IJ found petitioner to be removable but granted the request for voluntary departure under \u00a7 1229c(b) (2000 ed.). The BIA affirmed on November 4, 2005, without a written opinion. It ordered petitioner to depart within 30 days or suffer statutory penalties, including a civil fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 and ineligibility for relief under \u00a7\u00a7 240A, 240B, 245, 248, and 249 of the INA for a period of 10 years. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5-6.</p>\n<p>Two days before expiration of the 30-day period, on December 2, 2005, petitioner sought to withdraw his request for voluntary departure. At the same time he filed with the BIA a motion to reopen removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V). He contended that his motion recited new and material evidence demonstrating a bona fide marriage and that his case should be continued until the second I-130 petition was resolved.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2312</span> On February 8, 2006, more than two months after the voluntary departure period expired, the BIA denied the motion to reopen on the ground that petitioner had overstayed his voluntary departure period. Under \u00a7 240B(d) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), the BIA reasoned, an alien who has been granted voluntary departure but fails to depart in a timely fashion is statutorily barred from applying for and receiving certain forms of discretionary relief, including adjustment of status. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4. The BIA did not address petitioner's motion to withdraw his request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. <i>Dada v. Gonzales,</i> 207 Fed. Appx. 425 (2006) <i>(per curiam).</i> Relying on its decision in <i>Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales,</i> 445 F.3d 387 (2006), the court held that the BIA's reading of the applicable statutes as rendering petitioner ineligible for relief was reasonable. The Fifth Circuit joined the First and Fourth Circuits in concluding that there is no automatic tolling of the voluntary departure period. See <i>Chedad v. Gonzales,</i> 497 F.3d 57 (C.A.1 2007); <i>Dekoladenu v. Gonzales,</i> 459 F.3d 500 (C.A.4 2006). Four other Courts of Appeals have reached the opposite conclusion. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Kanivets v. Gonzales,</i> 424 F.3d 330 (C.A.3 2005); <i>Sidikhouya v. Gonzales,</i> 407 F.3d 950 (C.A.8 2005); <i>Azarte v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1278 (C.A.9 2005); <i>Ugokwe v. United States Atty. Gen.,</i> 453 F.3d 1325 (C.A.11 2006).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, see <i>Dada v. Keisler,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 36, 168 L.Ed.2d 805 (2007), to resolve the disagreement among the Court of Appeals. After oral argument we ordered supplemental briefing, see 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1116, 169 L.Ed.2d 805 (2008), to address whether an alien may withdraw his request for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period. Also after oral argument, on January 10, 2008, petitioner's second I-130 application was denied by the IJ on the ground that his marriage is a sham, contracted solely to obtain immigration benefits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Resolution of the questions presented turns on the interaction of two statutory schemes \u0097 the statutory right to file a motion to reopen in removal proceedings; and the rules governing voluntary departure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Voluntary departure is a discretionary form of relief that allows certain favored aliens \u0097 either before the conclusion of removal proceedings or after being found deportable \u0097 to leave the country willingly. Between 1927 to 2005, over 42 million aliens were granted voluntary departure; almost 13 million of those departures occurred between 1996 and 2005 alone. See Dept. of Homeland Security, Aliens Expelled: Fiscal Years 1892 to 2005, Table 38 (2005), online at http://www.dhs.gov/ ximgtn/statistics/ publications/YrBk05En.shtm (all Internet materials as visited June 13, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).</p>\n<p>Voluntary departure was \"originally developed by administrative officers, in the absence of a specific mandate in the statute.\" 6 C. Gordon, S. Mailman, &amp; S. Yale-Loehr, Immigration Law and Procedure \u00a7 74.02[1], p. 74-15 (rev. ed.2007) (hereinafter Gordon). The practice was first codified in the Alien Registration Act of 1940, \u00a7 20, 54 Stat. 671. The Alien Registration Act amended \u00a7 19 of the Immigration Act of Feb. 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 889, to provide that an alien \"deportable under any law of the United States and who has proved good moral character for the preceding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2313</span> five years\" may be permitted by the Attorney General to \"depart the United States to any country of his choice at his own expense, in lieu of deportation.\" \u00a7 20(c), 54 Stat. 672.</p>\n<p>In 1996, perhaps in response to criticism of immigration officials who had expressed frustration that aliens granted voluntary departure were \"permitted to continue their illegal presence in the United States for months, and even years,\" Letter from Benjamin G. Habberton, Acting Commissioner on Immigration and Naturalization, to the Executive Director of the President's Commission on Immigration and Naturalization, reprinted in Hearings before the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 1954 (Comm. Print 1952), Congress curtailed the period of time during which an alien may remain in the United States pending voluntary departure. The Act, as pertinent to voluntary departures requested at the conclusion of removal proceedings, provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Attorney General may permit an alien voluntarily to depart the United States at the alien's own expense if, at the conclusion of a proceeding under section 1229a of this title, the immigration judge enters an order granting voluntary departure in lieu of removal and finds that \u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) the alien has been physically present in the United States for a period of at least one year immediately preceding the date the notice to appear was served under section 1229(a) of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) the alien is, and has been, a person of good moral character for at least 5 years immediately preceding the alien's application for voluntary departure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) the alien is not deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) or section 1227(a)(4) of this title; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(D) the alien has established by clear and convincing evidence that the alien has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<p>See also \u00a7 1229c(a)(1) (\"The Attorney General may permit an alien voluntarily to depart the United States at the alien's own expense under this subsection\" in lieu of being subject to removal proceedings or prior to the completion of those proceedings; the alien need not meet the requirements of \u00a7 1229c(b)(1) if removability is conceded).</p>\n<p>When voluntary departure is requested at the conclusion of removal proceedings, as it was in this case, the statute provides a voluntary departure period of not more than 60 days. See \u00a7 1229c(b)(2). The alien can receive up to 120 days if he or she concedes removability and requests voluntary departure before or during removal proceedings. See \u00a7 1229c(a)(2)(A). Appropriate immigration authorities may extend the time to depart but only if the voluntary departure period is less than the statutory maximum in the first instance. The voluntary departure period in no event may exceed 60 or 120 days for \u00a7 1229c(b) and \u00a7 1229c(a) departures, respectively. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1240.26(f) (2007) (\"Authority to extend the time within which to depart voluntarily specified initially by an immigration judge or the Board is only within the jurisdiction of the district director, the Deputy Executive Associate Commissioner for Detention and Removal, or the Director of the Office of Juvenile Affairs .... In no event can the total period of time, including any extension, exceed 120 days or 60 days as set forth in section 240B of the Act\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2314</span> The voluntary departure period typically does not begin to run until administrative appeals are concluded. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(47)(B) (\"The order ... shall become final upon the earlier of \u0097 (i) a determination by the Board of Immigration Appeals affirming such order; or (ii) the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review of such order by the Board of Immigration Appeals\"); \u00a7 1229c(b)(1) (Attorney General may permit voluntary departure at conclusion of removal proceedings); see also 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.6(a) (2007) (\"[T]he decision in any proceeding ... from which an appeal to the Board may be taken shall not be executed during the time allowed for the filing of an appeal ... \"). In addition some Federal Courts of Appeals have found that they may stay voluntary departure pending consideration of a petition for review on the merits. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Thapa v. Gonzales,</i> 460 F.3d 323, 329-332 (C.A.2 2006); <i>Obale v. Attorney General of United States,</i> 453 F.3d 151, 155-157 (C.A.3 2006). But see <i>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft,</i> 371 F.3d 182, 194 (C.A.4 2004). This issue is not presented here, however, and we leave its resolution for another day.</p>\n<p>Voluntary departure, under the current structure, allows the Government and the alien to agree upon a <i>quid pro quo.</i> From the Government's standpoint, the alien's agreement to leave voluntarily expedites the departure process and avoids the expense of deportation \u0097 including procuring necessary documents and detaining the alien pending deportation. The Government also eliminates some of the costs and burdens associated with litigation over the departure. With the apparent purpose of assuring that the Government attains the benefits it seeks, the Act imposes limits on the time for voluntary departure, see <i>supra,</i> at 2313, and prohibits judicial review of voluntary departure decisions, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229c(f) and 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>Benefits to the alien from voluntary departure are evident as well. He or she avoids extended detention pending completion of travel arrangements; is allowed to choose when to depart (subject to certain constraints); and can select the country of destination. And, of great importance, by departing voluntarily the alien facilitates the possibility of readmission. The practice was first justified as involving \"no warrant of deportation ... so that if [the alien reapplies] for readmission in the proper way he will not be barred.\" 2 National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement: Report on the Enforcement of the Deportation Laws of the United States 57, 102-103 (1931) (Report No. 5). The current statute likewise allows an alien who voluntarily departs to sidestep some of the penalties attendant to deportation. Under the current Act, an alien involuntarily removed from the United States is ineligible for readmission for a period of 5, 10, or 20 years, depending upon the circumstances of removal. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(i) (\"Any alien who has been ordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title or at the end of proceedings under section 1229a of this title initiated upon the alien's arrival in the United States and who again seeks admission within 5 years of the date of such removal (or within 20 years in the case of a second or subsequent removal ...) is inadmissible\"); \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii) (\"Any alien not described in clause (i) who \u0097 (I) has been ordered removed under section [240] or any other provision of law, or (II) departed the United States while an order of removal was outstanding, and who seeks admission within 10 years of the date of such alien's departure or removal ... is inadmissible\"). An alien who makes a timely departure under a grant of voluntary departure, on the other hand, is not subject to these restrictions \u0097 although he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2315</span> or she otherwise may be ineligible for readmission based, for instance, on an earlier unlawful presence in the United States, see \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>A motion to reopen is a form of procedural relief that \"asks the Board to change its decision in light of newly discovered evidence or a change in circumstances since the hearing.\" 1 Gordon \u00a7 3.05[8][c]. Like voluntary departure, reopening is a judicial creation later codified by federal statute. An early reference to the procedure was in 1916, when a Federal District Court addressed an alien's motion to reopen her case to provide evidence of her marriage to a United States citizen. See <i>Ex parte Chan Shee,</i> 236 F. 579 (N.D.Cal. 1916); see also <i>Chew Hoy Quong v. White,</i> 244 F. 749, 750 (C.A.9 1917) (addressing an application to reopen to correct discrepancies in testimony). \"The reopening of a case by the immigration authorities for the introduction of further evidence\" was treated then, as it is now, as \"a matter for the exercise of their discretion\"; where the alien was given a \"full opportunity to testify and to present all witnesses and documentary evidence at the original hearing,\" judicial interference was deemed unwarranted. <i>Wong Shong Been v. Proctor,</i> 79 F.2d 881, 883 (C.A.9 1935).</p>\n<p>In 1958, when the BIA was established, the Attorney General promulgated a rule for the reopening and reconsideration of removal proceedings, 8 CFR \u00a7 3.2, upon which the current regulatory provision is based. See 23 Fed.Reg. 9115, 9118-9119 (1958), final rule codified at 8 CFR \u00a7 3.2 (1959) (\"The Board may on its own motion reopen or reconsider any case in which it has rendered a decision\" upon a \"written motion\"); see also Board of Immigration Appeals: Powers; and Reopening or Reconsideration of Cases, 27 Fed.Reg. 96-97 (Jan. 5, 1962). Until 1996, there was no time limit for requesting the reopening of a case due to the availability of new evidence.</p>\n<p>Then, in 1990, \"fear[ful] that deportable or excludable aliens [were] try[ing] to prolong their stays in the U.S. by filing one type of discretionary relief ... after another in immigration proceedings,\" Justice Dept. Finds Aliens Not Abusing Requests for Relief, 68 No. 27 Interpreter Releases 907 (July 22, 1991), Congress ordered the Attorney General to \"issue regulations with respect to ... the period of time in which motions to reopen ... may be offered in deportation proceedings,\" including \"a limitation on the number of such motions that may be filed and a maximum time period for the filing of such motions,\" \u00a7 545(d)(1), 104 Stat. 5066. The Attorney General found little evidence of abuse, concluding that requirements for reopening are a disincentive to bad faith filings. See 68 Interpreter Releases, <i>supra.</i> Because \"Congress ... neither rescinded [n]or amended its mandate to limit the number and time frames of motions,\" however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a regulation imposing new time limits and restrictions on filings. The new regulation allowed the alien to file one motion to reopen within 90 days. Executive Office for Immigration Review; Motions and Appeals in Immigration Proceedings, 61 Fed. Reg. 18900, 18901, 18905 (1996); see 8 CFR \u00a7 3.2(c) (1996).</p>\n<p>With the 1996 enactment of the Act, Congress adopted the recommendations of the DOJ with respect to numerical and time limits. The current provision governing motions to reopen states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(A) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"An alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) Contents</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2316</span> \"The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) Deadline</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) \"In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Except as provided in this subparagraph, the motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp.V).</blockquote>\n<p>To qualify as \"new,\" \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B), the facts must be \"material\" and of the sort that \"could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing,\" 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (2007); 1 Gordon \u00a7 3.05[8][c] (\"Evidence is not previously unavailable merely because the movant chose not to testify or to present evidence earlier, or because the IJ refused to admit the evidence\"). There are narrow exceptions to the 90-day filing period for asylum proceedings and claims of battered spouses, children, and parents, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii), (iv) (2000 ed., Supp. V), which are not applicable here.</p>\n<p>The Act, to be sure, limits in significant ways the availability of the motion to reopen. It must be noted, though, that the Act transforms the motion to reopen from a regulatory procedure to a statutory form of relief available to the alien. Nowhere in \u00a7 1229c(b) or \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) did Congress discuss the impact of the statutory right to file a motion to reopen on a voluntary departure agreement. And no legislative history indicates what some Members of Congress might have intended with respect to the motion's status once the voluntary departure period has elapsed. But the statutory text is plain insofar as it guarantees to each alien the right to file \"one motion to reopen proceedings under this section.\" \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Government argues that, by requesting and obtaining permission to voluntarily depart, the alien knowingly surrenders the opportunity to seek reopening. See Brief for Respondent 29-30. Further, according to the Government, petitioner's proposed rule for tolling the voluntary departure period would undermine the \"carefully crafted rules governing voluntary departure,\" including the statutory directive that these aliens leave promptly. <i>Id.,</i> at 18, 46-47.</p>\n<p>To be sure, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(2) contains no ambiguity: The period within which the alien may depart voluntarily \"shall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days.\" See also 8 CFR \u00a7 1240.26(f) (2007) (\"In no event can the total period of time, including any extension, exceed\" the statutory periods prescribed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(a) and \u00a7 1229c(b)); \u00a7 1229c(d) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (imposing statutory penalties for failure to depart). Further, \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) does not forbid a scheme under which an alien knowingly relinquishes the right to seek reopening in exchange for other benefits, including those available to the alien under the voluntary departure statute. That does not describe this case, however. Nothing in the statutes or past usage with respect to voluntary departure or motions to reopen indicates they cannot coexist. Neither \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) nor \u00a7 1229c(b)(2) says anything about the filing of a motion to reopen by an alien who has requested and been granted the opportunity to voluntarily depart. And there is no other statutory language that would place the alien on notice of an inability to seek the case's reopening in the event of newly discovered evidence or changed circumstances <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2317</span> bearing upon eligibility for relief.</p>\n<p>In reading a statute we must not \"look merely to a particular clause,\" but consider \"in connection with it the whole statute.\" <i>Kokoszka v. Belford,</i> 417 U.S. 642, 650, 94 S.Ct. 2431, 41 L.Ed.2d 374 (1974) (quoting <i>Brown v.

It would render the statutory right to seek reopening a nullity in most cases of voluntary departure. (And this group is not insignificant in number; between 2002 and 2006, 897,267 aliens were found removable, of which 122,866, or approximately 13.7%, were granted voluntary departure. See DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, FY 2006 Statistical Year Book, at Q 1 (Feb.2007).) It is foreseeable, and quite likely, that the time allowed for voluntary departure will expire long before the BIA issues a decision on a timely filed motion to reopen. See Proposed Rules, DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 72 Fed.Reg. 67674, 67677, and n. 2 (2007) (\"As a practical matter, it is often the case that an immigration judge or the Board cannot reasonably be expected to adjudicate a motion to reopen or reconsider during the voluntary departure period\"). These practical limitations must be taken into account. In the present case the BIA denied petitioner's motion to reopen 68 days after he filed the motion \u0097 and 66 days after his voluntary departure period had expired. Although the record contains no statistics on the average disposition time for motions to reopen, the number of BIA proceedings has increased over the last two decades, doubling between 1992 and 2000 alone; and, as a result, the BIA's backlog has more than tripled, resulting in a total of 63,763 undecided cases in 2000. See Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP, Study Conducted for: the American Bar Association Commission on Immigration Policy, Practice and Pro Bono Re: Board of Immigration Appeals: Procedural Reforms to Improve Case Management 13 (2003), online at http://www.dorsey. com/files/upload/DorseyStudyABA_8mgPDF.pdf.</p>\n<p>Since 2000, the BIA has adopted new procedures to reduce its backlog and shorten disposition times. In 2002, the DOJ introduced rules to improve case management, including an increase in the number of cases referred to a single Board member and use of summary disposition procedures for cases without basis in law or fact. See BIA: Procedural Reforms to Improve Case Management, 67 Fed.Reg. 54878 (2002), final rule codified at 8 CFR \u00a7 1003 (2006); see also \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (summary affirmance procedures). Nevertheless, on September 30, 2005, there were 33,063 cases pending before the BIA, 18% <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2318</span> of which were more than a year old. See FY 2006 Statistical Year Book, <i>supra,</i> at U1. On September 30, 2006, approximately 20% of the cases pending had been filed during fiscal year 2005. See <i>ibid.</i> Whether an alien's motion will be adjudicated within the 60-day statutory period in all likelihood will depend on pure happenstance \u0097 namely, the backlog of the particular Board member to whom the motion is assigned. Cf. <i>United States v. Wilson,</i> 503 U.S. 329, 334, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992) (arbitrary results are \"not to be presumed lightly\").</p>\n<p>Absent tolling or some other remedial action by the Court, then, the alien who is granted voluntary departure but whose circumstances have changed in a manner cognizable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and Charybdis: He or she can leave the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order; but, pursuant to regulation, the motion to reopen will be deemed withdrawn. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(d); see also 23 Fed.Reg. 9115, 9118, final rule codified at 8 CFR \u00a7 3.2 (1958). Alternatively, if the alien wishes to pursue reopening and remains in the United States to do so, he or she risks expiration of the statutory period and ineligibility for adjustment of status, the underlying relief sought. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (failure to timely depart renders alien \"ineligible, for a period of 10 years,\" for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 240A, adjustment of status under \u00a7 245, change of nonimmigrant status under \u00a7 248, and registry under \u00a7 249 of the INA); see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4 (treating petitioner's motion to reopen as forfeited for failure to depart).</p>\n<p>The purpose of a motion to reopen is to ensure a proper and lawful disposition. We must be reluctant to assume that the voluntary departure statute was designed to remove this important safeguard for the distinct class of deportable aliens most favored by the same law. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229c(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (barring aliens who have committed, <i>inter alia,</i> aggravated felonies or terrorism offenses from receiving voluntary departure); \u00a7 1229c(b)(1)(B) (requiring an alien who obtains voluntary departure at the conclusion of removal proceedings to demonstrate \"good moral character\"). This is particularly so when the plain text of the statute reveals no such limitation. See <i>Costello v. INS,</i> 376 U.S. 120, 127-128, 84 S.Ct. 580, 11 L.Ed.2d 559 (1964) (counseling long hesitation \"before adopting a construction of [the statute] which would, with respect to an entire class of aliens, completely nullify a procedure so intrinsic a part of the legislative scheme\"); see also <i>Stone v. INS,</i> 514 U.S. 386, 399, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (\"Congress might not have wished to impose on the alien\" the difficult choice created by treating a motion to reopen as rendering the underlying order nonfinal for purposes of judicial review); <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 320, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (recognizing \"`the longstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the alien'\" (quoting <i>INS v. Gardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. 421, 449, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>It is necessary, then, to read the Act to preserve the alien's right to pursue reopening while respecting the Government's interest in the <i>quid pro quo</i> of the voluntary departure arrangement.</p>\n<p>Some solutions, though, do not conform to the statutory design. Petitioner, as noted, proposes automatic tolling of the voluntary departure period during the pendency <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2319</span> of the motion to reopen. We do not find statutory authority for this result. Voluntary departure is an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like a settlement agreement. In return for anticipated benefits, including the possibility of readmission, an alien who requests voluntary departure represents that he or she \"has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so\" promptly. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(1)(D); 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1240.26(c)(1)(2) (2007); cf. \u00a7 1240.26(c)(3) (the judge may impose additional conditions to \"ensure the alien's timely departure from the United States\"). Included among the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually depart, within the 60-day period. Cf. <i>United States v. Brockamp,</i> 519 U.S. 347, 352, 117 S.Ct. 849, 136 L.Ed.2d 818 (1997) (substantive limitations are not subject to equitable tolling). If the alien is permitted to stay in the United States past the departure date to wait out the adjudication of the motion to reopen, he or she cannot then demand the full benefits of voluntary departure; for the benefit to the Government \u0097 a prompt and costless departure \u0097 would be lost. Furthermore, it would invite abuse by aliens who wish to stay in the country but whose cases are not likely to be reopened by immigration authorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Although a statute or regulation might be adopted to resolve the dilemma in a different manner, as matters now stand the appropriate way to reconcile the voluntary departure and motion to reopen provisions is to allow an alien to withdraw the request for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period.</p>\n<p>The DOJ, which has authority to adopt regulations relevant to the issue at hand, has made a preliminary determination that the Act permits an alien to withdraw an application for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period. According to this proposal, there is nothing in the Act or the implementing regulations that makes the grant of voluntary departure irrevocable. See 72 Fed.Reg. 67679. Accordingly, the DOJ has proposed an amendment to 8 CFR \u00a7 1240.26 that, prospectively, would \"provide for the automatic termination of a grant of voluntary departure upon the timely filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider, as long as the motion is filed prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period.\" 72 Fed. Reg. 67679, Part IV-D; cf. <i>id.,</i> at 67682, Part VI (\"The provisions of this proposed rule will be applied prospectively only, that is, only with respect to immigration judge orders issued on or after the effective date of the final rule that grant a period of voluntary departure\"). Although not binding in the present case, the DOJ's proposed interpretation of the statutory and regulatory scheme as allowing an alien to withdraw from a voluntary departure agreement \"warrants respectful consideration.\" <i>Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs. v. Blumer,</i> 534 U.S. 473, 497, 122 S.Ct. 962, 151 L.Ed.2d 935 (2002) (citing <i>United States v. Mead Corp.,</i> 533 U.S. 218, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001), and <i>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala,</i> 512 U.S. 504, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994)).</p>\n<p>We hold that, to safeguard the right to pursue a motion to reopen for voluntary departure recipients, the alien must be permitted to withdraw, unilaterally, a voluntary departure request before expiration of the departure period, without regard to the underlying merits of the motion to reopen. As a result, the alien has the option either to abide by the terms, and receive the agreed-upon benefits, of voluntary departure; or, alternatively, to forgo <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2320</span> those benefits and remain in the United States to pursue an administrative motion.</p>\n<p>If the alien selects the latter option, he or she gives up the possibility of readmission and becomes subject to the IJ's alternate order of removal. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1240.26(d). The alien may be removed by the Department of Homeland Security within 90 days, even if the motion to reopen has yet to be adjudicated. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(A). But the alien may request a stay of the order of removal, see BIA Practice Manual \u00a7 6.3(a), online at http:// www.usdoj.gov/eoir/vll/ qapracmanual/apptmtn4.htm; cf. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C) (providing that a removal order entered <i>in absentia</i> is stayed automatically pending a motion to reopen); and, though the BIA has discretion to deny the motion for a stay, it may constitute an abuse of discretion for the BIA to do so where the motion states nonfrivolous grounds for reopening.</p>\n<p>Though this interpretation still confronts the alien with a hard choice, it avoids both the quixotic results of the Government's proposal and the elimination of benefits to the Government that would follow from petitioner's tolling rule. Contrary to the Government's assertion, the rule we adopt does not alter the <i>quid pro quo</i> between the Government and the alien. If withdrawal is requested prior to expiration of the voluntary departure period, the alien has not received benefits without costs; the alien who withdraws from a voluntary departure arrangement is in the same position as an alien who was not granted voluntary departure in the first instance. Allowing aliens to withdraw from their voluntary departure agreements, moreover, establishes a greater probability that their motions to reopen will be considered. At the same time, it gives some incentive to limit filings to nonfrivolous motions to reopen; for aliens with changed circumstances of the type envisioned by Congress in drafting \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) are the ones most likely to forfeit their previous request for voluntary departure in return for the opportunity to adjudicate their motions. Cf. Supplemental Brief for Respondent 1-2 (\"[I]t is extraordinarily rare for an alien who has requested and been granted voluntary departure by the BIA to seek to withdraw from that arrangement within the voluntary departure period\").</p>\n<p>A more expeditious solution to the untenable conflict between the voluntary departure scheme and the motion to reopen might be to permit an alien who has departed the United States to pursue a motion to reopen postdeparture, much as Congress has permitted with respect to judicial review of a removal order. See IIRIRA \u00a7 306(b), 110 Stat. 3009-612 (repealing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c) (1994 ed.), which prohibited an alien who \"departed from the United States after the issuance of the order\" to seek judicial review). As noted previously, 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(d) provides that the alien's departure constitutes withdrawal of the motion to reopen. This regulation, however, has not been challenged in these proceedings, and we do not consider it here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Petitioner requested withdrawal of his motion for voluntary departure prior to expiration of his 30-day departure period. The BIA should have granted this request, without regard to the merits of petitioner's I-130 petition, and permitted petitioner to pursue his motion to reopen. We find this same mistake implicit in the Court of Appeals' decision. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2321</span> Justice SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice THOMAS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The statutory provision at issue here authorizes the Attorney General to permit an alien who has been found deportable, if he so requests, to depart the country voluntarily. This enables the alien to avoid detention pending involuntary deportation, to select his own country of destination, to leave according to his own schedule (within the prescribed period), and to avoid restrictions upon readmission that attend involuntary departure. The statute specifies that the permission \"shall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days,\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(2), and that failure to depart within the prescribed period causes the alien to be ineligible for certain relief, including adjustment of status, for 10 years, \u00a7 1229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Moreover, pursuant to a regulation that the Court accepts as valid, departure (whether voluntary or involuntary) terminates the alien's ability to move for reopening of his removal proceeding, and withdraws any such motion filed before his departure. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(d) (2007). All of these provisions were in effect when petitioner agreed to depart, and the Court cites no statute or regulation currently in force that permits an alien who has agreed voluntarily to depart to change his mind. Yet the Court holds that petitioner must be permitted to renounce that agreement (the opinion dresses this up as \"withdraw[ing] the motion for voluntary departure\") provided the request is made before the departure period expires. <i>Ante,</i> at 2311. That is \"necessary,\" the Court says, to \"preserve the alien's right to pursue reopening,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2318, forfeiture of which was the known consequence of the departure he had agreed to. The Court's perceived \"necessity\" does not exist, and the Court lacks the authority to impose its chosen remedy. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Court is resolute in its belief that there is a \"conflict between the right to file a motion to reopen and the provision requiring voluntary departure no later than 60 days.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2311. The statute cannot be interpreted to put the alien to the choice of either (1) \"remain[ing] in the United States to ensure [his] motion to reopen remains pending, while incurring statutory penalties for overstaying the voluntary departure date\" or (2) \"avoid[ing] penalties by prompt departure but abandon[ing] the motion to reopen.\" <i>Ibid.</i> This, according to the Court, would \"render the statutory right to seek reopening a nullity in most cases of voluntary departure.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2316-2317. Indeed, the problem is of mythological proportions: \"[T]he alien who is granted voluntary departure but whose circumstances have changed in a manner cognizable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and Charybdis: He or she can leave the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order; but, pursuant to regulation, the motion to reopen will be deemed withdrawn.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2318. So certain is the Court of this premise that it is asserted no less than seven times during the course of today's opinion. See <i>ante,</i> at 2311, 2316, 2317-2320.</p>\n<p>The premise is false. It would indeed be extraordinary (though I doubt it would justify a judicial rewrite) for a statute to impose that stark choice upon an alien: depart and lose your right to seek reopening, or stay and incur statutory penalties. But that is <i>not</i> the choice this statute imposes. It offers the alien a deal, if he finds it in his interest and wishes to take it: \"Agree to depart voluntarily (within the specified period, of course) and you may lose your right to pursue reopening, but you will not suffer detention, you can <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2322</span> depart at your own convenience rather than ours, and to the destination that you rather than we select, and you will not suffer the statutory restrictions upon reentry that accompany involuntary departure. If you accept this deal, however, but do not live up to it\u0097if you fail to depart as promised within the specified period\u0097you will become ineligible for cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, and voluntary departure.\" Seems entirely reasonable to me. Litigants are put to similar voluntary choices between the rock and the whirlpool all the time, without cries for a judicial rewrite of the law. It happens, for example, whenever a criminal defendant is offered a plea bargain that gives him a lesser sentence than he might otherwise receive but deprives him of his right to trial by jury and his right to appeal. It is indeed utterly commonplace that <i>electing</i> to pursue one avenue of relief may require the surrender of certain other remedies.</p>\n<p>Petitioner requested and accepted the above described deal, but now\u0097to put the point bluntly but entirely accurately\u0097he wants to back out. The case is as simple as that. Two days before the deadline for his promised voluntary departure, he filed a motion asking the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to reopen his removal proceedings and remand his case to the Immigration Judge for adjustment of status based on his wife's pending visa petition. Administrative Record 3; see <i>id.,</i> at 8-21. The motion also asked the BIA to \"withdraw his request for voluntary departure\" and \"instead accep[t] an order of deportation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 10. After the voluntary departure period expired, the BIA denied petitioner's motion to reopen, explaining that under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), \"an alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure... is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that the BIA proceeded just as it should have, and just as petitioner had every reason to expect. To be sure, the statute provides for the right to file (and presumably to have ruled upon in due course) a petition to reopen. But it does not forbid the relinquishment of that right in exchange for other benefits that the BIA has discretion to provide. Nor does it suggest any weird departure from the ancient rule that an offer (the offer to depart voluntarily in exchange for specified benefits, and with specified consequences for default) cannot be \"withdrawn\" after it has been accepted and after the <i>quid pro quo</i> promise (to depart) has been made.</p>\n<p>The Court's rejection of this straightforward analysis is inconsistent with its treatment of petitioner's argument that the statute requires automatic tolling of the voluntary departure period while a motion to reopen is pending. With respect to that argument, the Court says:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Voluntary departure is an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like a settlement agreement. In return for anticipated benefits, including the possibility of readmission, an alien who requests voluntary departure represents that he or she `has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so' promptly. Included among the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually depart, within the 60-day period.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2318-2319 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Precisely so. But also among the substantive burdens is the inability to receive certain relief through a motion to reopen once the promised departure date has passed; and perhaps paramount among the substantive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2323</span> burdens is that the alien is <i>bound</i> to his agreement. The Court is quite right that the Act does not allow us to require that an alien who agrees to depart voluntarily must receive the benefits of his bargain without the costs. But why does it allow us to convert the alien's statutorily required promise to depart voluntarily into an \"option either to abide by the terms, and receive the agreed-upon benefits, of voluntary departure; or, alternatively, to forgo those benefits and remain in the United States to pursue an administrative motion\"? <i>Ante,</i> at 2319. And why does it allow us to nullify the provision of \u00a7 1229c(d)(1) that failure to depart within the prescribed and promised period causes the alien to be ineligible for certain relief, including adjustment of status (which is what petitioner seeks here) for 10 years?</p>\n<p>Of course it is not unusual for the Court to blue-pencil a statute in this fashion, directing that one of its provisions, severable from the rest, be disregarded. But that is done when the blue-penciled provision is <i>unconstitutional.</i> It would be unremarkable, if the Court found that the alien had a constitutional right to reopen, and that conditioning permission for voluntary departure upon waiver of that right was an unconstitutional condition, for the Court to order that the alien cannot be held to his commitment. But that is not the case here. The Court holds that the plain requirement of the statute and of validly adopted regulations cannot be enforced <i>because the statute itself forbids it.</i></p>\n<p>Not so. The Court derives this prohibition from its belief that an alien must, no matter what, be given the full benefit of the right to reopen, even if that means creating an extrastatutory option to renege upon the statutorily contemplated agreement to depart voluntarily. \"We must be reluctant to assume,\" the Court says, \"that the voluntary departure statute was designed to remove this important safeguard [of the motion to reopen],\" \"particularly so when the plain text of the statute reveals no such limitation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2318. But in fact that safeguard is not sacrosanct. The \"plain text of the statute\" does <i>cause</i> voluntary departure to remove that safeguard for at least 30 days of its 90-day existence, and <i>permits</i> voluntary departure to remove it almost entirely. Section 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V) generally permits the filing of a motion to reopen \"within 90 days of ... entry of a final administrative order of removal.\" But as I have described, \u00a7 1229c(b)(2) (2000 ed.) provides that a grant of voluntary departure issued at the conclusion of removal proceedings \"shall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days.\" Since motions to reopen cannot be filed after removal or departure, the unquestionable effect of the statutory scheme is to deprive the alien who agrees to voluntary departure of the (sacrosanct) right to reopen for a full third of its existence. And since 60 days is merely the maximum period for a voluntary departure, it is theoretically possible for the right to reopen to be limited to one week, or even one day. Given that reality, it is not at all hard to believe that the statute allows nullification of motions to reopen requesting adjustment of status filed within the 60-day departure period and not ruled upon before departure. Indeed, it seems to me much more likely that the statute allows that than that it allows judicial imposition of the unheard-of rule that a promise to depart is not a promise to depart, and judicial nullification of a statutorily prescribed penalty for failure to depart by the gimmick of allowing the request for voluntary departure to be \"withdrawn.\"</p>\n<p>The same analysis makes it true that, even under the Court's reconstructed statute, a removable alien's agreement to depart voluntarily may limit, and in some <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2324</span> instances foreclose, his ability to pursue a motion to reopen at a later date. Even if the alien who has agreed to voluntary departure is permitted to renege within the specified departure period, that period can be no longer than 60 days after entry of the order of removal\u0097meaning that he has been deprived of at least 30 days of his right to reopen. Thus, the Court has not \"reconciled\" statutory provisions; it has simply rewritten two of them to satisfy its notion of sound policy\u0097the requirement of a commitment to depart and the prescription that a failure to do so prevents adjustment of status.</p>\n<p>The Court suggests that the statute compels its conclusion because otherwise \"[w]hether an alien's motion will be adjudicated within the 60-day statutory period in all likelihood will depend on pure happenstance\u0097namely, the backlog of the particular Board member to whom the motion is assigned\" and because \"arbitrary results are `not to be presumed lightly.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2318. It is, however, a happenstance that the alien embraces when he makes his commitment to leave, and its effect upon him is therefore not arbitrary. If he wants to be sure to have his motion to reopen considered, he should not enter into the voluntary departure agreement. A reading of the statute that permits that avoidable happenstance seems to me infinitely more plausible than a reading that turns a commitment to depart into an option to depart.</p>\n<p>But the most problematic of all the Court's reasons for allowing petitioner to withdraw his motion to depart voluntarily is its reliance on the Department of Justice's (DOJ) as-yet-unadopted proposal that is in some respects (though not the crucial one) similar to the Court's rule. See <i>ante,</i> at 2319-2320 (citing Proposed Rules, DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 72 Fed.Reg. 67674, 67677, and n. 2 (2007)). I shall assume that the proposed rule would be valid, even though it converts the statutory <i>requirement</i> of departure within the prescribed period (on pain of losing the right to seek adjustment of status) into an <i>option</i> to depart.<sup>[1]</sup> According to the Court, the proposed regulation \"`warrants respectful consideration.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2319-2320. What this evidently means is respectful adoption of that portion of the proposed regulation with which the Court agrees, and <i>sub silentio</i> rejection of that portion it disfavors, namely: \"The provisions of this proposed rule will be applied ... only with respect to immigration judge orders issued on or after the effective date of the final rule that grant a period of voluntary departure,\" 72 Fed.Reg. 67682. See Supp. Brief for Respondent 8-9 (observing that the rule \"will not apply to petitioner's case\"). Our administrative law jurisprudence is truly in a state of confused degeneration if this pick-and-choose technique constitutes \"respectful\" consideration.</p>\n<p>It must be acknowledged, however, that the Department's proposed regulation has some bearing upon this case: It demonstrates that the agency is actively considering whether the terms it has prescribed for its discretionary grants of voluntary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2325</span> departure are too harsh and should be revised for the future, perhaps along the very lines that the Justices in today's majority would choose if they were the Attorney General. It shows, in other words, that today's interpretive gymnastics may have been performed, not for the enjoyment of innumerable aliens in the future, but for Mr. Dada alone.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>In the final analysis, the Court's entire approach to interpreting the statutory scheme can be summed up in this sentence from its opinion: \"Allowing aliens to withdraw from their voluntary departure agreements [ ] establishes a greater probability that their motions to reopen will be considered.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2320. That is true enough. What does not appear from the Court's opinion, however, is the source of the Court's authority to increase that probability in flat contradiction to the text of the statute. Just as the <i>Government</i> can (absent some other statutory restriction) relieve criminal defendants of their plea agreements for one reason or another, the <i>Government</i> may well be able to let aliens who have agreed to depart the country voluntarily repudiate their agreements. This Court lacks such authority, and nothing in the statute remotely dictates the result that today's judgment decrees. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This case presents two questions: (1) \"[w]hether the filing of a motion to reopen removal proceedings automatically tolls the period within which an alien must depart... under an order granting voluntary departure,\" Brief for Petitioner i, and (2) \"[w]hether an alien who has been granted voluntary departure and has filed a timely motion to reopen should be permitted to withdraw the request for voluntary departure prior to the expiration of the departure period,\" 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1116, 169 L.Ed.2d 805 (2008). I agree with the Court that the answer to the first question is no. <i>Ante,</i> at 2311.</p>\n<p>As to the second question, the Court's reasoning escapes me. The Court holds as follows: \"<i>Absent a valid regulation resolving the dilemma in a different way,</i>\" \"the appropriate way to reconcile the\" relevant provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \"is to allow an alien to withdraw the request for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2311, 2319 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court apparently does not hold that the statute compels the Government to permit an alien to withdraw a request for voluntary departure, only that the statute permits that approach, a proposition with which I agree.</p>\n<p>Since the statute does not decide the question whether an alien should be permitted to withdraw a voluntary departure request, the authority to make that policy choice rests with the agency. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A.,</i> 517 U.S. 735, 740-741, 116 S.Ct. 1730, 135 L.Ed.2d 25 (1996) (noting the \"presumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2326</span> in a statute meant for implementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency\"); <i>Department of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA,</i> 494 U.S. 922, 932-933, 110 S.Ct. 1623, 108 L.Ed.2d 914 (1990) (refusing to sustain an agency's decision on the ground that it was based on \"a permissible (though not an inevitable) construction of [a] statute,\" because the agency should define and adopt that construction \"in the first instance\"). Accordingly, at the time of the decision in petitioner's case, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) had the authority (a) to adopt the majority's automatic withdrawal rule (indeed, the agency has proposed a regulation to that effect, see <i>ante,</i> at 2319-2320), (b) to decide that withdrawal should be permitted in certain circumstances, which may or may not be present here, or (c) to hold that a motion to withdraw is never appropriate.</p>\n<p>Neither the BIA nor the Fifth Circuit addressed petitioner's motion to withdraw, see <i>ante,</i> at 2312, and therefore the ground for the Board's decision is unclear. I would affirm if the BIA either chose as a general matter not to permit the withdrawal of requests for voluntary departure or decided that permitting withdrawal was not appropriate under the facts of this case. However, if the BIA rejected the withdrawal request on the ground that it lacked the statutory authority to permit it, the Board erred. Because the ground for the BIA's decision is uncertain, I would vacate and remand.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  An agency need not adopt, as we must, the <i>best</i> reading of a statute, but merely one that is permissible. See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 866, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Moreover, the proposed rule, operating only prospectively, makes the ability to withdraw part of the deal that the alien accepts, and limits the alien's commitment accordingly. Petitioner's promise has already been made, and the requirement that he depart within the specified period is unconditional.</p>\n<p>[2]  Justice ALITO agrees that the statute does not require the BIA to grant petitioner's motion to withdraw from his agreement to depart voluntarily. He chooses to remand the case because the BIA did not give the reason for its denial of the withdrawal motion, and he believes the reason would be the wrong one if the BIA thought it lacked statutory authority to grant. <i>Post,</i> at 2325-2326 (dissenting opinion). But petitioner has challenged neither the adequacy of the BIA's reason for denying his motion, nor the BIA's failure to specify a reason. He has argued only that the statute requires that he be allowed to withdraw.</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued January 7, 2008\u2014Decided June 16, 2008\nPetitioner, a native and citizen of Nigeria, alleges that he married an\n  American citizen in 1999. His wife filed an I\u2013130 Petition for Alien\n  Relative on his behalf that was denied in 2003. The Department of\n  Homeland Security (DHS) charged Dada with being removable under\n  the Immigration and Nationality Act for overstaying his temporary\n  nonimmigrant visa. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the request\n  for a continuance pending adjudication of a second I\u2013130 petition,\n  found Dada eligible for removal, and granted his request for volun-\n  tary departure under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229c(b). The Board of Immigration\n  Appeals (BIA) affirmed and ordered Dada to depart within 30 days or\n  suffer statutory penalties. Two days before the end of the 30-day pe-\n  riod, Dada sought to withdraw his voluntary departure request and\n  filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings under 8 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71229a(c)(7), contending that new and material evidence demon-\n  strated a bona fide marriage and that his case should be continued\n  until resolution of the second I\u2013130 petition. After the voluntary de-\n  parture period had expired, the BIA denied the request, reasoning\n  that an alien who has been granted voluntary departure but does not\n  depart in a timely fashion is statutorily barred from receiving ad-\n  justment of status. It did not consider Dada\u2019s request to withdraw\n  his voluntary departure request. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: An alien must be permitted an opportunity to withdraw a motion\n for voluntary departure, provided the request is made before expira-\n tion of the departure period. Pp. 5\u201320.\n    (a) Resolution of this case turns on the interaction of two aspects of\n the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n 1996\u2014the alien\u2019s right to file a motion to reopen in removal proceed-\n ings and the rules governing voluntary departure. Pp. 5\u201312.\n2                           DADA v. MUKASEY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n         (1) Voluntary departure is discretionary relief that allows certain\n    favored aliens to leave the country willingly. It benefits the Govern-\n    ment by, e.g., expediting the departure process and avoiding deporta-\n    tion expenses, and benefits the alien by, e.g., facilitating readmission.\n    To receive these benefits, the alien must depart timely. As relevant\n    here, when voluntary departure is requested at the conclusion of re-\n    moval proceedings, the departure period may not exceed 60 days. 8\n    U. S. C. \u00a71229c(b)(2). Pp. 5\u20139.\n         (2) An alien is permitted to file one motion to reopen,\n    \u00a71229a(c)(7)(A), asking the BIA to change its decision because of\n    newly discovered evidence or changed circumstances. The motion\n    generally must be filed within 90 days of a final administrative re-\n    moval order, \u00a71229a(c)(7)(C)(1). Although neither the text of \u00a71229c\n    or \u00a71229a(c)(7) nor the applicable legislative history indicates\n    whether Congress intended for an alien granted voluntary departure\n    to be permitted to pursue a motion to reopen, the statutory text\n    plainly guarantees to each alien the right to file \u201cone motion to re-\n    open proceedings under this section,\u201d \u00a71229a(c)(7)(A). Pp. 9\u201312.\n       (b) Section 1229c(b)(2) unambiguously states that the voluntary\n    departure period \u201cshall not be valid\u201d for more than \u201c60 days,\u201d but\n    says nothing about the motion to reopen; and nothing in the statutes\n    or past usage indicates that voluntary departure or motions to reopen\n    cannot coexist. In reading a statute, the Court must not \u201clook merely\n    to a particular clause,\u201d but consider \u201cin connection with it the whole\n    statute.\u201d Kokoszka v. Belford, 417 U. S. 642, 650. Reading the Act as\n    a whole, and considering the statutory scheme governing voluntary\n    departure alongside \u00a71229a(c)(7)(A)\u2019s right to pursue \u201cone motion to\n    reopen,\u201d the Government\u2019s position that an alien who has agreed to\n    voluntarily depart is not entitled to pursue a motion to reopen is un-\n    sustainable. It would render the statutory reopening right a nullity\n    in most voluntary departure cases since it is foreseeable, and quite\n    likely, that the voluntary departure time will expire long before the\n    BIA decides a timely-filed motion to reopen. Absent tolling or some\n    other remedial action by this Court, then, the alien who is granted\n    voluntary departure but whose circumstances have changed in a\n    manner cognizable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and\n    Charybdis: The alien either may leave the United States in accor-\n    dance with the voluntary departure order, with the effect that the\n    motion to reopen is deemed withdrawn, or may stay in the United\n    States to pursue the case\u2019s reopening, risking expiration of the depar-\n    ture period and ineligibility for adjustment of status, the underlying\n    relief sought. Because a motion to reopen is meant to ensure a\n    proper and lawful disposition, this Court is reluctant to assume that\n    the voluntary departure statute is designed to make reopening un-\n                     Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  available for the distinct class of deportable aliens most favored by\n  the same law, when the statute\u2019s plain text reveals no such limita-\n  tion. Pp. 12\u201316.\n     (c) It is thus necessary to read the Act to preserve the alien\u2019s right\n  to pursue reopening while respecting the Government\u2019s interest in\n  the voluntary departure arrangement\u2019s quid pro quo. There is no\n  statutory authority for petitioner\u2019s proposal to automatically toll the\n  voluntary departure period during the motion to reopen\u2019s pendency.\n  Voluntary departure is an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much\n  like a settlement agreement. An alien who is permitted to stay past\n  the departure date to wait out the motion to reopen\u2019s adjudication\n  cannot then demand the full benefits of voluntary departure, for the\n  Government\u2019s benefit\u2014a prompt and costless departure\u2014would be\n  lost. It would also invite abuse by aliens who wish to stay in the\n  country but whose cases are unlikely to be reopened. Absent a valid\n  regulation otherwise, the appropriate way to reconcile the voluntary\n  departure and motion to reopen provisions is to allow an alien to\n  withdraw from the voluntary departure agreement. The Department\n  of Justice, which has authority to adopt the relevant regulations, has\n  made a preliminary determination that the Act permits an alien to\n  withdraw a voluntary departure application before expiration of the\n  departure period. Although not binding in the present case, this pro-\n  posed interpretation \u201cwarrants respectful consideration.\u201d Wisconsin\n  Dept. of Health and Family Servs. v. Blumer, 534 U. S. 473, 497. To\n  safeguard the right to pursue a motion to reopen for voluntary depar-\n  ture recipients, the alien must be permitted to withdraw, unilater-\n  ally, a voluntary departure request before the departure period ex-\n  pires, without regard to the motion to reopen\u2019s underlying merits.\n  The alien has the option either to abide by the voluntary departure\u2019s\n  terms, and receive its agreed-upon benefits; or, alternatively, to forgo\n  those benefits and remain in the country to pursue an administrative\n  motion. An alien selecting the latter option gives up the possibility of\n  readmission and becomes subject to the IJ\u2019s alternative order of re-\n  moval. The alien may be removed by the DHS within 90 days, even if\n  the motion to reopen has yet to be adjudicated. But the alien may\n  request a stay of the removal order, and, though the BIA has discre-\n  tion to deny a motion for a stay based on the merits of the motion to\n  reopen, it may constitute an abuse of discretion for the BIA to deny a\n  motion for stay where the motion states nonfrivolous grounds for re-\n  opening. Though this interpretation still confronts the alien with a\n  hard choice, it avoids both the quixotic results of the Government\u2019s\n  proposal and the elimination of benefits to the Government that\n  would follow from petitioner\u2019s tolling rule.

MICHAEL B.\n       MUKASEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 16, 2008]\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We decide in this case whether an alien who has re-\nquested and been granted voluntary departure from the\nUnited States, a form of discretionary relief that avoids\ncertain statutory penalties, must adhere to that election\nand depart within the time prescribed, even if doing so\ncauses the alien to forgo a ruling on a pending, unresolved\nmotion to reopen the removal proceedings. The case turns\nupon the interaction of relevant provisions of the Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996, 110 Stat. 3009\u2013546 (IIRIRA or Act). The Act pro-\nvides that every alien ordered removed from the United\nStates has a right to file one motion to reopen his or her\nremoval proceedings. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7) (2000\ned., Supp. V). The statute also provides, however, that if\nthe alien\u2019s request for voluntary departure is granted after\nhe or she is found removable, the alien is required to\ndepart within the period prescribed by immigration offi-\ncials, which cannot exceed 60 days. See \u00a71229c(b)(2) (2000\ned.). Failure to depart within the prescribed period ren-\nders the alien ineligible for certain forms of relief, includ-\n2                    DADA v. MUKASEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning adjustment of status, for a period of 10 years.\n\u00a71229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Pursuant to regulation,\nhowever, departure has the effect of withdrawing the\nmotion to reopen. See 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(d) (2007).\n   Without some means, consistent with the Act, to recon-\ncile the two commands\u2014one directing voluntary departure\nand the other directing termination of the motion to re-\nopen if an alien departs the United States\u2014an alien who\nseeks reopening has two poor choices: The alien can re-\nmain in the United States to ensure the motion to reopen\nremains pending, while incurring statutory penalties for\noverstaying the voluntary departure date; or the alien can\navoid penalties by prompt departure but abandon the\nmotion to reopen.\n   The issue is whether Congress intended the statutory\nright to reopen to be qualified by the voluntary departure\nprocess. The alien, who is petitioner here, urges that\nfiling a motion to reopen tolls the voluntary departure\nperiod pending the motion\u2019s disposition. We reject this\ninterpretation because it would reconfigure the voluntary\ndeparture scheme in a manner inconsistent with the\nstatutory design. We do not have the authority to inter-\npret the statute as petitioner suggests. Still, the conflict\nbetween the right to file a motion to reopen and the provi-\nsion requiring voluntary departure no later than 60 days\nremains untenable if these are the only two choices avail-\nable to the alien. Absent a valid regulation resolving the\ndilemma in a different way, we conclude the alien must be\npermitted an opportunity to withdraw the motion for\nvoluntary departure, provided the request is made before\nthe departure period expires. Petitioner attempted to\navail himself of this opportunity below. The Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit did not disturb the Board of\nImmigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA or Board) denial of petitioner\u2019s\nrequest to withdraw the voluntary departure election. We\nnow reverse its decision and remand the case.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n   Petitioner Samson Taiwo Dada, a native and citizen of\nNigeria, came to the United States in April 1998 on a\ntemporary nonimmigrant visa. He overstayed it. In 1999,\npetitioner alleges, he married an American citizen. Peti-\ntioner\u2019s wife filed an I\u2013130 Petition for Alien Relative on\nhis behalf. The necessary documentary evidence was not\nprovided, however, and the petition was denied in Febru-\nary 2003.\n   In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\ncharged petitioner with being removable under\n\u00a7237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n(INA), 66 Stat. 201, as amended, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(1)(B)\n(2000 ed., Supp. V), for overstaying his visa. Petitioner\u2019s\nwife then filed a second I\u2013130 petition. The Immigration\nJudge (IJ) denied petitioner\u2019s request for a continuance\npending adjudication of the newly filed I\u2013130 petition and\nnoted that those petitions take an average of about three\nyears to process. The IJ found petitioner to be removable\nbut granted the request for voluntary departure under\n\u00a71229c(b) (2000 ed.). The BIA affirmed on November 4,\n2005, without a written opinion. It ordered petitioner to\ndepart within 30 days or suffer statutory penalties, includ-\ning a civil fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than\n$5,000 and ineligibility for relief under \u00a7\u00a7240A, 240B, 245,\n248, and 249 of the INA for a period of 10 years. See App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 5\u20136.\n   Two days before expiration of the 30-day period, on\nDecember 2, 2005, petitioner sought to withdraw his\nrequest for voluntary departure. At the same time he filed\nwith the BIA a motion to reopen removal proceedings\nunder 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V). He\ncontended that his motion recited new and material evi-\ndence demonstrating a bona fide marriage and that his\ncase should be continued until the second I\u2013130 petition\nwas resolved.\n4                    DADA v. MUKASEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   On February 8, 2006, more than two months after the\nvoluntary departure period expired, the BIA denied the\nmotion to reopen on the ground that petitioner had over-\nstayed his voluntary departure period. Under \u00a7240B(d) of\nthe INA, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229c(d) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), the\nBIA reasoned, an alien who has been granted voluntary\ndeparture but fails to depart in a timely fashion is statuto-\nrily barred from applying for and receiving certain forms\nof discretionary relief, including adjustment of status. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 3\u20134. The BIA did not address peti-\ntioner\u2019s motion to withdraw his request for voluntary\ndeparture.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nDada v. Gonzales, 207 Fed. Appx. 425 (2006) (per curiam).\nRelying on its decision in Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales, 445\nF. 3d 387 (2006), the court held that the BIA\u2019s reading of\nthe applicable statutes as rendering petitioner ineligible\nfor relief was reasonable. The Fifth Circuit joined the\nFirst and Fourth Circuits in concluding that there is no\nautomatic tolling of the voluntary departure period. See\nChedad v. Gonzales, 497 F. 3d 57 (CA1 2007); Dekoladenu\nv. Gonzales, 459 F. 3d 500 (CA4 2006). Four other Courts\nof Appeals have reached the opposite conclusion. See, e.g.,\nKanivets v. Gonzales, 424 F. 3d 330 (CA3 2005); Sidik\u00ad\nhouya v. Gonzales, 407 F. 3d 950 (CA8 2005); Azarte v.\nAshcroft, 394 F. 3d 1278 (CA9 2005); Ugokwe v. United\nStates Atty.

Between 1927 to\n2005, over 42 million aliens were granted voluntary depar-\nture; almost 13 million of those departures occurred be-\ntween 1996 and 2005 alone. See Dept. of Homeland Secu-\nrity, Aliens Expelled: Fiscal Years 1892 to 2005, Table 38\n(2005), online at http://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/statistics/\npublications/YrBk05En.shtm (all Internet materials as\nvisited June 13, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file).\n   Voluntary departure was \u201coriginally developed by ad-\nministrative officers, in the absence of a specific mandate\nin the statute.\u201d 6 C.

The Alien Registration Act amended \u00a719 of the Im-\nmigration Act of Feb. 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 889, to provide that\nan alien \u201cdeportable under any law of the United States\nand who has proved good moral character for the preced-\ning five years\u201d may be permitted by the Attorney General\nto \u201cdepart the United States to any country of his choice at\nhis own expense, in lieu of deportation.\u201d \u00a720(c), 54 Stat.\n672.\n   In 1996, perhaps in response to criticism of immigration\n6                    DADA v. MUKASEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nofficials who had expressed frustration that aliens granted\nvoluntary departure were \u201cpermitted to continue their\nillegal presence in the United States for months, and even\nyears,\u201d Letter from Benjamin G. Habberton, Acting Com-\nmissioner on Immigration and Naturalization, to the\nExecutive Director of the President\u2019s Commission on\nImmigration and Naturalization, reprinted in Hearings\nbefore the House of Representatives Committee on the\nJudiciary, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 1954 (Comm. Print 1952),\nCongress curtailed the period of time during which an\nalien may remain in the United States pending voluntary\ndeparture. The Act, as pertinent to voluntary departures\nrequested at the conclusion of removal proceedings,\nprovides:\n    \u201cThe Attorney General may permit an alien voluntar-\n    ily to depart the United States at the alien\u2019s own ex-\n    pense if, at the conclusion of a proceeding under sec-\n    tion 1229a of this title, the immigration judge enters\n    an order granting voluntary departure in lieu of re-\n    moval and finds that\u2014\n       \u201c(A) the alien has been physically present in the\n       United States for a period of at least one year im-\n       mediately preceding the date the notice to appear\n       was served under section 1229(a) of this title;\n       \u201c(B) the alien is, and has been, a person of good\n       moral character for at least 5 years immediately\n       preceding the alien\u2019s application for voluntary de-\n       parture;\n       \u201c(C) the alien is not deportable under section\n       1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) or section 1227(a)(4) of this title;\n       and\n       \u201c(D) the alien has established by clear and convinc-\n       ing evidence that the alien has the means to depart\n       the United States and intends to do so.\u201d 8 U. S. C.\n       \u00a71229c(b)(1).\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

See \u00a71229c(b)(2). The alien can receive up\nto 120 days if he or she concedes removability and re-\nquests voluntary departure before or during removal\nproceedings. See \u00a71229c(a)(2)(A). Appropriate immigra-\ntion authorities may extend the time to depart but only if\nthe voluntary departure period is less than the statutory\nmaximum in the first instance. The voluntary departure\nperiod in no event may exceed 60 or 120 days for \u00a71229c(b)\nand \u00a71229c(a) departures, respectively.         See 8 CFR\n\u00a71240.26(f) (2007) (\u201cAuthority to extend the time within\nwhich to depart voluntarily specified initially by an immi-\ngration judge or the Board is only within the jurisdiction\nof the district director, the Deputy Executive Associate\nCommissioner for Detention and Removal, or the Director\nof the Office of Juvenile Affairs. . . . In no event can the\ntotal period of time, including any extension, exceed 120\ndays or 60 days as set forth in section 240B of the Act\u201d).\n   The voluntary departure period typically does not begin\nto run until administrative appeals are concluded. See 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71101(47)(B) (\u201cThe order . . . shall become final\nupon the earlier of\u2014(i) a determination by the Board of\nImmigration Appeals affirming such order; or (ii) the\nexpiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to\nseek review of such order by the Board of Immigration\nAppeals\u201d); \u00a71229c(b)(1) (Attorney General may permit\nvoluntary departure at conclusion of removal proceedings);\nsee also 8 CFR \u00a71003.6(a) (2007) (\u201c[T]he decision in any\n8                    DADA v.

In addition some Federal\nCourts of Appeals have found that they may stay volun-\ntary departure pending consideration of a petition for\nreview on the merits. See, e.g., Thapa v. Gonzales, 460\nF. 3d 323, 329\u2013332 (CA2 2006); Obale v. Attorney General\nof United States, 453 F. 3d 151, 155\u2013157 (CA3 2006). But\nsee Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, 371 F. 3d 182, 194 (CA4 2004).\nThis issue is not presented here, however, and we leave its\nresolution for another day.\n  Voluntary departure, under the current structure, al-\nlows the Government and the alien to agree upon a quid\npro quo. From the Government\u2019s standpoint, the alien\u2019s\nagreement to leave voluntarily expedites the departure\nprocess and avoids the expense of deportation\u2014including\nprocuring necessary documents and detaining the alien\npending deportation. The Government also eliminates\nsome of the costs and burdens associated with litigation\nover the departure. With the apparent purpose of assur-\ning that the Government attains the benefits it seeks, the\nAct imposes limits on the time for voluntary departure,\nsee supra, at 7, and prohibits judicial review of voluntary\ndeparture decisions, see 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71229c(f) and\n1252(a)(2)(B)(i).\n  Benefits to the alien from voluntary departure are evi-\ndent as well. He or she avoids extended detention pending\ncompletion of travel arrangements; is allowed to choose\nwhen to depart (subject to certain constraints); and can\nselect the country of destination. And, of great impor-\ntance, by departing voluntarily the alien facilitates the\npossibility of readmission. The practice was first justified\nas involving \u201cno warrant of deportation . . . so that if [the\nalien reapplies] for readmission in the proper way he will\nnot be barred.\u201d 2 National Commission on Law Obser-\nvance and Enforcement: Report on the Enforcement of the\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nDeportation Laws of the United States 57, 102\u2013103 (1931)\n(Report No. 5). The current statute likewise allows an\nalien who voluntarily departs to sidestep some of the\npenalties attendant to deportation. Under the current\nAct, an alien involuntarily removed from the United\nStates is ineligible for readmission for a period of 5, 10, or\n20 years, depending upon the circumstances of removal.\nSee 8 U. S. C. \u00a71182(a)(9)(A)(i) (\u201cAny alien who has been\nordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title or at\nthe end of proceedings under section 1229a of this title\ninitiated upon the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States and\nwho again seeks admission within 5 years of the date of\nsuch removal (or within 20 years in the case of a second or\nsubsequent removal . . . ) is inadmissible\u201d); \u00a71182(a)(9)\n(A)(ii) (\u201cAny alien not described in clause (i) who\u2014(I) has\nbeen ordered removed under section [240] or any other\nprovision of law, or (II) departed the United States while\nan order of removal was outstanding, and who seeks ad-\nmission within 10 years of the date of such alien\u2019s depar-\nture or removal . . . is inadmissible\u201d).      An alien who\nmakes a timely departure under a grant of voluntary\ndeparture, on the other hand, is not subject to these re-\nstrictions\u2014although he or she otherwise may be ineligible\nfor readmission based, for instance, on an earlier unlawful\npresence in the United States, see \u00a71182(a)(9)(B)(i).\n                             B\n  A motion to reopen is a form of procedural relief that\n\u201casks the Board to change its decision in light of newly\ndiscovered evidence or a change in circumstances since the\nhearing.\u201d 1 Gordon \u00a73.05[8][c]. Like voluntary departure,\nreopening is a judicial creation later codified by federal\nstatute. An early reference to the procedure was in 1916,\nwhen a Federal District Court addressed an alien\u2019s motion\nto reopen her case to provide evidence of her marriage to a\nUnited States citizen. See Ex parte Chan Shee, 236 F. 579\n10                   DADA v. MUKASEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(ND Cal. 1916); see also Chew Hoy Quong v. White, 244 F.\n749, 750 (CA9 1917) (addressing an application to reopen\nto correct discrepancies in testimony). \u201cThe reopening of a\ncase by the immigration authorities for the introduction of\nfurther evidence\u201d was treated then, as it is now, as \u201ca\nmatter for the exercise of their discretion\u201d; where the alien\nwas given a \u201cfull opportunity to testify and to present all\nwitnesses and documentary evidence at the original hear-\ning,\u201d judicial interference was deemed unwarranted.\nWong Shong Been v. Proctor, 79 F. 2d 881, 883 (CA9 1935).\n   In 1958, when the BIA was established, the Attorney\nGeneral promulgated a rule for the reopening and recon-\nsideration of removal proceedings, 8 CFR \u00a73.2, upon which\nthe current regulatory provision is based. See 23 Fed.\nReg. 9115, 9118\u20139119 (1958), final rule codified at 8 CFR\n\u00a73.2 (1959) (\u201cThe Board may on its own motion reopen or\nreconsider any case in which it has rendered a decision\u201d\nupon a \u201cwritten motion\u201d); see also Board of Immigration\nAppeals: Powers; and Reopening or Reconsideration of\nCases, 27 Fed. Reg. 96\u201397 (Jan. 5, 1962). Until 1996,\nthere was no time limit for requesting the reopening of a\ncase due to the availability of new evidence.\n   Then, in 1990, \u201cfear[ful] that deportable or excludable\naliens [were] try[ing] to prolong their stays in the U. S. by\nfiling one type of discretionary relief . . . after another in\nimmigration proceedings,\u201d Justice Dept. Finds Aliens Not\nAbusing Requests for Relief, 68 No. 27 Interpreter Re-\nleases 907 (July 22, 1991), Congress ordered the Attorney\nGeneral to \u201cissue regulations with respect to . . . the period\nof time in which motions to reopen . . . may be offered in\ndeportation proceedings,\u201d including \u201ca limitation on the\nnumber of such motions that may be filed and a maximum\ntime period for the filing of such motions,\u201d \u00a7545(d)(1), 104\nStat. 5066. The Attorney General found little evidence of\nabuse, concluding that requirements for reopening are a\ndisincentive to bad faith filings. See 68 Interpreter Re-\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nleases, supra. Because \u201cCongress . . . neither rescinded\n[n]or amended its mandate to limit the number and time\nframes of motions,\u201d however, the Department of Justice\n(DOJ) issued a regulation imposing new time limits and\nrestrictions on filings. The new regulation allowed the\nalien to file one motion to reopen within 90 days. Execu-\ntive Office for Immigration Review; Motions and Appeals\nin Immigration Proceedings, 61 Fed. Reg. 18900, 18901,\n18905 (1996); see 8 CFR \u00a73.2(c) (1996).\n   With the 1996 enactment of the Act, Congress adopted\nthe recommendations of the DOJ with respect to numeri-\ncal and time limits. The current provision governing\nmotions to reopen states:\n    \u201c(A) In general\n       \u201cAn alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings\n    under this section . . . .\n    \u201c(B) Contents\n       \u201cThe motion to reopen shall state the new facts that\n    will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is\n    granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other\n    evidentiary material.\n    \u201c(C) Deadline\n       (i) \u201cIn general\n       \u201cExcept as provided in this subparagraph, the mo-\n    tion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date\n    of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d 8\n    U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V).\n  To qualify as \u201cnew,\u201d \u00a71229a(c)(7)(B), the facts must be\n\u201cmaterial\u201d and of the sort that \u201ccould not have been dis-\ncovered or presented at the former hearing,\u201d 8 CFR\n\u00a71003.2(c)(1) (2007); 1 Gordon \u00a73.05[8][c] (\u201cEvidence is not\npreviously unavailable merely because the movant chose\nnot to testify or to present evidence earlier, or because the\nIJ refused to admit the evidence\u201d). There are narrow\nexceptions to the 90-day filing period for asylum pro-\n12                   DADA v.

C. \u00a7\u00a71229a(c)(7)(C)(ii), (iv) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. V), which are not applicable here.\n  The Act, to be sure, limits in significant ways the avail-\nability of the motion to reopen. It must be noted, though,\nthat the Act transforms the motion to reopen from a regu-\nlatory procedure to a statutory form of relief available to\nthe alien. Nowhere in \u00a71229c(b) or \u00a71229a(c)(7) did Con-\ngress discuss the impact of the statutory right to file a\nmotion to reopen on a voluntary departure agreement.\nAnd no legislative history indicates what some Members of\nCongress might have intended with respect to the motion\u2019s\nstatus once the voluntary departure period has elapsed.\nBut the statutory text is plain insofar as it guarantees to\neach alien the right to file \u201cone motion to reopen proceed-\nings under this section.\u201d \u00a71229a(c)(7)(A) (2000 ed., Supp.\nV).\n                             III\n   The Government argues that, by requesting and obtain-\ning permission to voluntarily depart, the alien knowingly\nsurrenders the opportunity to seek reopening. See Brief\nfor Respondent 29\u201330. Further, according to the Govern-\nment, petitioner\u2019s proposed rule for tolling the voluntary\ndeparture period would undermine the \u201ccarefully crafted\nrules governing voluntary departure,\u201d including the statu-\ntory directive that these aliens leave promptly. Id., at 18,\n46\u201347.\n   To be sure, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229c(b)(2) contains no ambigu-\nity: The period within which the alien may depart volun-\ntarily \u201cshall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days.\u201d\nSee also 8 CFR \u00a71240.26(f) (2007) (\u201cIn no event can the\ntotal period of time, including any extension, exceed\u201d the\nstatutory periods prescribed by 8 U.

That\ndoes not describe this case, however. Nothing in the stat-\nutes or past usage with respect to voluntary departure or\nmotions to reopen indicates they cannot coexist. Neither\n\u00a71229a(c)(7) nor \u00a71229c(b)(2) says anything about the\nfiling of a motion to reopen by an alien who has requested\nand been granted the opportunity to voluntarily depart.\nAnd there is no other statutory language that would place\nthe alien on notice of an inability to seek the case\u2019s reopen-\ning in the event of newly discovered evidence or changed\ncircumstances bearing upon eligibility for relief.\n   In reading a statute we must not \u201clook merely to a\nparticular clause,\u201d but consider \u201cin connection with it the\nwhole statute.\u201d Kokoszka v. Belford, 417 U. S. 642, 650\n(1974) (quoting Brown v. Duchesne, 19 How. 183, 194\n(1857); internal quotation marks omitted); see also Gozlon-\nPeretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991) (\u201c \u2018In\ndetermining the meaning of the statute, we look not only\nto the particular statutory language, but to the design of\nthe statute as a whole and to its object and policy\u2019 \u201d (quot-\ning Crandon v.

S. C.\n\u00a71229a(c)(7)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. V) to pursue \u201cone motion\nto reopen proceedings,\u201d the Government\u2019s position that the\nalien is not entitled to pursue a motion to reopen if the\nalien agrees to voluntarily depart is unsustainable. It\nwould render the statutory right to seek reopening a\n14                   DADA v. MUKASEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnullity in most cases of voluntary departure. (And this\ngroup is not insignificant in number; between 2002 and\n2006, 897,267 aliens were found removable, of which\n122,866, or approximately 13.7%, were granted voluntary\ndeparture. See DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration\nReview, FY 2006 Statistical Year Book, at Q 1 (Feb. 2007).)\nIt is foreseeable, and quite likely, that the time allowed for\nvoluntary departure will expire long before the BIA issues\na decision on a timely filed motion to reopen. See Pro-\nposed Rules, DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Re-\nview, Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen\nor Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 72 Fed. Reg. 67674,\n67677, and n. 2 (2007) (\u201cAs a practical matter, it is often\nthe case that an immigration judge or the Board cannot\nreasonably be expected to adjudicate a motion to reopen or\nreconsider during the voluntary departure period\u201d). These\npractical limitations must be taken into account. In the\npresent case the BIA denied petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen\n68 days after he filed the motion\u2014and 66 days after his\nvoluntary departure period had expired. Although the\nrecord contains no statistics on the average disposition\ntime for motions to reopen, the number of BIA proceedings\nhas increased over the last two decades, doubling between\n1992 and 2000 alone; and, as a result, the BIA\u2019s backlog\nhas more than tripled, resulting in a total of 63,763 unde-\ncided cases in 2000.

Nevertheless, on September 30, 2005, there were\n33,063 cases pending before the BIA, 18% of which were\nmore than a year old. See FY 2006 Statistical Year Book,\nsupra, at U1. On September 30, 2006, approximately 20%\nof the cases pending had been filed during fiscal year\n2005. See ibid. Whether an alien\u2019s motion will be adjudi-\ncated within the 60-day statutory period in all likelihood\nwill depend on pure happenstance\u2014namely, the backlog of\nthe particular Board member to whom the motion is as-\nsigned. Cf. United States v. Wilson, 503 U. S. 329, 334\n(1992) (arbitrary results are \u201cnot to be presumed lightly\u201d).\n   Absent tolling or some other remedial action by the\nCourt, then, the alien who is granted voluntary departure\nbut whose circumstances have changed in a manner cogni-\nzable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and Charyb-\ndis: He or she can leave the United States in accordance\nwith the voluntary departure order; but, pursuant to\nregulation, the motion to reopen will be deemed with-\ndrawn. See 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(d); see also 23 Fed. Reg. 9115,\n9118, final rule codified at 8 CFR \u00a73.2 (1958). Alterna-\ntively, if the alien wishes to pursue reopening and remains\nin the United States to do so, he or she risks expiration of\nthe statutory period and ineligibility for adjustment of\nstatus, the underlying relief sought.        See 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (failure to timely depart\nrenders alien \u201cineligible, for a period of 10 years,\u201d for\ncancellation of removal under \u00a7240A, adjustment of status\nunder \u00a7245, change of nonimmigrant status under \u00a7248,\nand registry under \u00a7249 of the INA); see also App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 3\u20134 (treating petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen as\nforfeited for failure to depart).\n   The purpose of a motion to reopen is to ensure a proper\n16                   DADA v. MUKASEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand lawful disposition. We must be reluctant to assume\nthat the voluntary departure statute was designed to\nremove this important safeguard for the distinct class of\ndeportable aliens most favored by the same law. See 8\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71229c(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (barring aliens who have\ncommitted, inter alia, aggravated felonies or terrorism\noffenses     from     receiving     voluntary     departure);\n\u00a71229c(b)(1)(B) (requiring an alien who obtains voluntary\ndeparture at the conclusion of removal proceedings to\ndemonstrate \u201cgood moral character\u201d). This is particularly\nso when the plain text of the statute reveals no such limi-\ntation. See Costello v. INS, 376 U. S. 120, 127\u2013128 (1964)\n(counseling long hesitation \u201cbefore adopting a construction\nof [the statute] which would, with respect to an entire\nclass of aliens, completely nullify a procedure so intrinsic a\npart of the legislative scheme\u201d); see also Stone v.

In\nreturn for anticipated benefits, including the possibility of\nreadmission, an alien who requests voluntary departure\nrepresents that he or she \u201chas the means to depart the\nUnited States and intends to do so\u201d promptly. 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71229c(b)(1)(D); 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a71240.26(c)(1)\u2013(2) (2007); cf.\n\u00a71240.26(c)(3) (the judge may impose additional conditions\nto \u201censure the alien\u2019s timely departure from the United\nStates\u201d). Included among the substantive burdens im-\nposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure\nis the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually\ndepart, within the 60-day period. Cf. United States v.\nBrockamp, 519 U. S. 347, 352 (1997) (substantive limita-\ntions are not subject to equitable tolling). If the alien is\npermitted to stay in the United States past the departure\ndate to wait out the adjudication of the motion to reopen,\nhe or she cannot then demand the full benefits of volun-\ntary departure; for the benefit to the Government\u2014a\nprompt and costless departure\u2014would be lost. Further-\nmore, it would invite abuse by aliens who wish to stay in\nthe country but whose cases are not likely to be reopened\nby immigration authorities.\n                             B\n  Although a statute or regulation might be adopted to\nresolve the dilemma in a different manner, as matters now\nstand the appropriate way to reconcile the voluntary\ndeparture and motion to reopen provisions is to allow an\nalien to withdraw the request for voluntary departure\nbefore expiration of the departure period.\n  The DOJ, which has authority to adopt regulations\nrelevant to the issue at hand, has made a preliminary\ndetermination that the Act permits an alien to withdraw\nan application for voluntary departure before expiration of\nthe departure period. According to this proposal, there is\nnothing in the Act or the implementing regulations that\n18                   DADA v. MUKASEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmakes the grant of voluntary departure irrevocable. See\n72 Fed. Reg. 67679. Accordingly, the DOJ has proposed\nan amendment to 8 CFR \u00a71240.26 that, prospectively,\nwould \u201cprovide for the automatic termination of a grant of\nvoluntary departure upon the timely filing of a motion to\nreopen or reconsider, as long as the motion is filed prior to\nthe expiration of the voluntary departure period.\u201d 72 Fed.\nReg. 67679, Part IV\u2013D; cf. id., at 67682, Part VI (\u201cThe\nprovisions of this proposed rule will be applied prospec-\ntively only, that is, only with respect to immigration judge\norders issued on or after the effective date of the final rule\nthat grant a period of voluntary departure\u201d). Although not\nbinding in the present case, the DOJ\u2019s proposed interpre-\ntation of the statutory and regulatory scheme as allowing\nan alien to withdraw from a voluntary departure agree-\nment \u201cwarrants respectful consideration.\u201d Wisconsin Dept.\nof Health and Family Servs. v. Blumer, 534 U. S. 473, 497\n(2002) (citing United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218\n(2001), and Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S.\n504 (1994)).\n   We hold that, to safeguard the right to pursue a motion\nto reopen for voluntary departure recipients, the alien\nmust be permitted to withdraw, unilaterally, a voluntary\ndeparture request before expiration of the departure pe-\nriod, without regard to the underlying merits of the mo-\ntion to reopen. As a result, the alien has the option either\nto abide by the terms, and receive the agreed-upon bene-\nfits, of voluntary departure; or, alternatively, to forgo\nthose benefits and remain in the United States to pursue\nan administrative motion.\n   If the alien selects the latter option, he or she gives up\nthe possibility of readmission and becomes subject to the\nIJ\u2019s alternate order of removal. See 8 CFR \u00a71240.26(d).\nThe alien may be removed by the Department of Home-\nland Security within 90 days, even if the motion to reopen\nhas yet to be adjudicated. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71231(a)(1)(A).\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

S. C. \u00a71229a(b)(5)(C) (providing that a removal order\nentered in absentia is stayed automatically pending a\nmotion to reopen); and, though the BIA has discretion to\ndeny the motion for a stay, it may constitute an abuse of\ndiscretion for the BIA to do so where the motion states\nnonfrivolous grounds for reopening.\n  Though this interpretation still confronts the alien with\na hard choice, it avoids both the quixotic results of the\nGovernment\u2019s proposal and the elimination of benefits to\nthe Government that would follow from petitioner\u2019s tolling\nrule. Contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, the rule we\nadopt does not alter the quid pro quo between the Gov-\nernment and the alien. If withdrawal is requested prior to\nexpiration of the voluntary departure period, the alien has\nnot received benefits without costs; the alien who with-\ndraws from a voluntary departure arrangement is in the\nsame position as an alien who was not granted voluntary\ndeparture in the first instance. Allowing aliens to with-\ndraw from their voluntary departure agreements, more-\nover, establishes a greater probability that their motions\nto reopen will be considered. At the same time, it gives\nsome incentive to limit filings to nonfrivolous motions to\nreopen; for aliens with changed circumstances of the type\nenvisioned by Congress in drafting \u00a71229a(c)(7) (2000 ed.\nand Supp. V) are the ones most likely to forfeit their pre-\nvious request for voluntary departure in return for the\nopportunity to adjudicate their motions. Cf. Supplemental\nBrief for Respondent 1\u20132 (\u201c[I]t is extraordinarily rare for\nan alien who has requested and been granted voluntary\ndeparture by the BIA to seek to withdraw from that ar-\nrangement within the voluntary departure period\u201d).\n  A more expeditious solution to the untenable conflict\nbetween the voluntary departure scheme and the motion\n20                   DADA v.

C. \u00a71105a(c) (1994\ned.), which prohibited an alien who \u201cdeparted from the\nUnited States after the issuance of the order\u201d to seek\njudicial review). As noted previously, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(d)\nprovides that the alien\u2019s departure constitutes withdrawal\nof the motion to reopen.

MICHAEL B.\n       MUKASEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                        [June 16, 2008]\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and\nJUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.\n   The statutory provision at issue here authorizes the\nAttorney General to permit an alien who has been found\ndeportable, if he so requests, to depart the country volun-\ntarily. This enables the alien to avoid detention pending\ninvoluntary deportation, to select his own country of des-\ntination, to leave according to his own schedule (within the\nprescribed period), and to avoid restrictions upon readmis-\nsion that attend involuntary departure. The statute speci-\nfies that the permission \u201cshall not be valid for a period\nexceeding 60 days,\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229c(b)(2), and that fail-\nure to depart within the prescribed period causes the alien\nto be ineligible for certain relief, including adjustment of\nstatus, for 10 years, \u00a71229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).\nMoreover, pursuant to a regulation that the Court accepts\nas valid, departure (whether voluntary or involuntary)\nterminates the alien\u2019s ability to move for reopening of his\nremoval proceeding, and withdraws any such motion filed\nbefore his departure. See 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(d) (2007). All of\nthese provisions were in effect when petitioner agreed to\ndepart, and the Court cites no statute or regulation cur-\nrently in force that permits an alien who has agreed vol-\nuntarily to depart to change his mind. Yet the Court holds\nthat petitioner must be permitted to renounce that agree-\n2                     DADA v. MUKASEY\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nment (the opinion dresses this up as \u201cwithdraw[ing] the\nmotion for voluntary departure\u201d) provided the request is\nmade before the departure period expires. Ante, at 2.\nThat is \u201cnecessary,\u201d the Court says, to \u201cpreserve the\nalien\u2019s right to pursue reopening,\u201d ante, at 16, forfeiture of\nwhich was the known consequence of the departure he had\nagreed to. The Court\u2019s perceived \u201cnecessity\u201d does not\nexist, and the Court lacks the authority to impose its\nchosen remedy. I respectfully dissent.\n                         *     *     *\n  The Court is resolute in its belief that there is a \u201cconflict\nbetween the right to file a motion to reopen and the provi-\nsion requiring voluntary departure no later than 60 days.\u201d\nAnte, at 2. The statute cannot be interpreted to put the\nalien to the choice of either (1) \u201cremain[ing] in the United\nStates to ensure [his] motion to reopen remains pending,\nwhile incurring statutory penalties for overstaying the\nvoluntary departure date\u201d or (2) \u201cavoid[ing] penalties by\nprompt departure but abandon[ing] the motion to reopen.\u201d\nIbid. This, according to the Court, would \u201crender the\nstatutory right to seek reopening a nullity in most cases of\nvoluntary departure.\u201d Ante, at 13\u201314. Indeed, the prob-\nlem is of mythological proportions: \u201c[T]he alien who is\ngranted voluntary departure but whose circumstances\nhave changed in a manner cognizable by a motion to re-\nopen is between Scylla and Charybdis: He or she can leave\nthe United States in accordance with the voluntary depar-\nture order; but, pursuant to regulation, the motion to\nreopen will be deemed withdrawn.\u201d Ante, at 15. So cer-\ntain is the Court of this premise that it is asserted no less\nthan seven times during the course of today\u2019s opinion. See\nante, at 2, 13, 15\u201319.\n  The premise is false. It would indeed be extraordinary\n(though I doubt it would justify a judicial rewrite) for a\nstatute to impose that stark choice upon an alien: depart\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

But that is not the choice this statute\nimposes. It offers the alien a deal, if he finds it in his\ninterest and wishes to take it: \u201cAgree to depart voluntarily\n(within the specified period, of course) and you may lose\nyour right to pursue reopening, but you will not suffer\ndetention, you can depart at your own convenience rather\nthan ours, and to the destination that you rather than we\nselect, and you will not suffer the statutory restrictions\nupon reentry that accompany involuntary departure. If\nyou accept this deal, however, but do not live up to it\u2014if\nyou fail to depart as promised within the specified pe-\nriod\u2014you will become ineligible for cancellation of re-\nmoval, adjustment of status, and voluntary departure.\u201d\nSeems entirely reasonable to me. Litigants are put to\nsimilar voluntary choices between the rock and the whirl-\npool all the time, without cries for a judicial rewrite of the\nlaw. It happens, for example, whenever a criminal defen-\ndant is offered a plea bargain that gives him a lesser\nsentence than he might otherwise receive but deprives\nhim of his right to trial by jury and his right to appeal. It\nis indeed utterly commonplace that electing to pursue one\navenue of relief may require the surrender of certain other\nremedies.\n   Petitioner requested and accepted the above described\ndeal, but now\u2014to put the point bluntly but entirely accu-\nrately\u2014he wants to back out. The case is as simple as\nthat. Two days before the deadline for his promised vol-\nuntary departure, he filed a motion asking the Board of\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) to reopen his removal proceed-\nings and remand his case to the Immigration Judge for\nadjustment of status based on his wife\u2019s pending visa\npetition. Administrative Record 3; see id., at 8\u201321. The\nmotion also asked the BIA to \u201cwithdraw his request for\nvoluntary departure\u201d and \u201cinstead accep[t] an order of\ndeportation.\u201d Id., at 10. After the voluntary departure\n4                    DADA v. MUKASEY\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nperiod expired, the BIA denied petitioner\u2019s motion to\nreopen, explaining that under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229c(d) (2000\ned. and Supp. V), \u201can alien who fails to depart following a\ngrant of voluntary departure . . . is statutorily barred from\napplying for certain forms of discretionary relief.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 3\u20134.\n  It seems to me that the BIA proceeded just as it should\nhave, and just as petitioner had every reason to expect. To\nbe sure, the statute provides for the right to file (and\npresumably to have ruled upon in due course) a petition to\nreopen. But it does not forbid the relinquishment of that\nright in exchange for other benefits that the BIA has\ndiscretion to provide. Nor does it suggest any weird de-\nparture from the ancient rule that an offer (the offer to\ndepart voluntarily in exchange for specified benefits, and\nwith specified consequences for default) cannot be \u201cwith-\ndrawn\u201d after it has been accepted and after the quid pro\nquo promise (to depart) has been made.\n  The Court\u2019s rejection of this straightforward analysis is\ninconsistent with its treatment of petitioner\u2019s argument\nthat the statute requires automatic tolling of the volun-\ntary departure period while a motion to reopen is pending.\nWith respect to that argument, the Court says:\n     \u201cVoluntary departure is an agreed-upon exchange of\n    benefits, much like a settlement agreement. In return\n    for anticipated benefits, including the possibility of\n    readmission, an alien who requests voluntary depar-\n    ture represents that he or she \u2018has the means to de-\n    part the United States and intends to do so\u2019 promptly.\n    Included among the substantive burdens imposed\n    upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is\n    the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually\n    depart, within the 60-day period.\u201d Ante, at 16\u201317 (ci-\n    tations omitted).\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nPrecisely so. But also among the substantive burdens is\nthe inability to receive certain relief through a motion to\nreopen once the promised departure date has passed; and\nperhaps paramount among the substantive burdens is\nthat the alien is bound to his agreement. The Court is\nquite right that the Act does not allow us to require that\nan alien who agrees to depart voluntarily must receive the\nbenefits of his bargain without the costs. But why does it\nallow us to convert the alien\u2019s statutorily required promise\nto depart voluntarily into an \u201coption either to abide by the\nterms, and receive the agreed-upon benefits, of voluntary\ndeparture; or, alternatively, to forgo those benefits and\nremain in the United States to pursue an administrative\nmotion\u201d? Ante, at 18. And why does it allow us to nullify\nthe provision of \u00a71229c(d)(1) that failure to depart within\nthe prescribed and promised period causes the alien to be\nineligible for certain relief, including adjustment of status\n(which is what petitioner seeks here) for 10 years?\n  Of course it is not unusual for the Court to blue-pencil a\nstatute in this fashion, directing that one of its provisions,\nseverable from the rest, be disregarded. But that is done\nwhen the blue-penciled provision is unconstitutional. It\nwould be unremarkable, if the Court found that the alien\nhad a constitutional right to reopen, and that conditioning\npermission for voluntary departure upon waiver of that\nright was an unconstitutional condition, for the Court to\norder that the alien cannot be held to his commitment.\nBut that is not the case here. The Court holds that the\nplain requirement of the statute and of validly adopted\nregulations cannot be enforced because the statute itself\nforbids it.\n  Not so. The Court derives this prohibition from its\nbelief that an alien must, no matter what, be given the full\nbenefit of the right to reopen, even if that means creating\nan extrastatutory option to renege upon the statutorily\ncontemplated agreement to depart voluntarily. \u201cWe must\n6                     DADA v. MUKASEY\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nbe reluctant to assume,\u201d the Court says, \u201cthat the volun-\ntary departure statute was designed to remove this impor-\ntant safeguard [of the motion to reopen],\u201d \u201cparticularly so\nwhen the plain text of the statute reveals no such limita-\ntion.\u201d Ante, at 16. But in fact that safeguard is not sacro-\nsanct. The \u201cplain text of the statute\u201d does cause voluntary\ndeparture to remove that safeguard for at least 30 days of\nits 90-day existence, and permits voluntary departure to\nremove it almost entirely. Section 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. V) generally permits the filing of a motion to reopen\n\u201cwithin 90 days of . . . entry of a final administrative order\nof removal.\u201d But as I have described, \u00a71229c(b)(2) (2000\ned.) provides that a grant of voluntary departure issued at\nthe conclusion of removal proceedings \u201cshall not be valid\nfor a period exceeding 60 days.\u201d Since motions to reopen\ncannot be filed after removal or departure, the unques-\ntionable effect of the statutory scheme is to deprive the\nalien who agrees to voluntary departure of the (sacro-\nsanct) right to reopen for a full third of its existence. And\nsince 60 days is merely the maximum period for a volun-\ntary departure, it is theoretically possible for the right to\nreopen to be limited to one week, or even one day. Given\nthat reality, it is not at all hard to believe that the statute\nallows nullification of motions to reopen requesting ad-\njustment of status filed within the 60-day departure pe-\nriod and not ruled upon before departure. Indeed, it\nseems to me much more likely that the statute allows that\nthan that it allows judicial imposition of the unheard-of\nrule that a promise to depart is not a promise to depart,\nand judicial nullification of a statutorily prescribed pen-\nalty for failure to depart by the gimmick of allowing the\nrequest for voluntary departure to be \u201cwithdrawn.\u201d\n   The same analysis makes it true that, even under the\nCourt\u2019s reconstructed statute, a removable alien\u2019s agree-\nment to depart voluntarily may limit, and in some in-\nstances foreclose, his ability to pursue a motion to reopen\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nat a later date. Even if the alien who has agreed to volun-\ntary departure is permitted to renege within the specified\ndeparture period, that period can be no longer than 60\ndays after entry of the order of removal\u2014meaning that he\nhas been deprived of at least 30 days of his right to reopen.\nThus, the Court has not \u201creconciled\u201d statutory provisions;\nit has simply rewritten two of them to satisfy its notion of\nsound policy\u2014the requirement of a commitment to depart\nand the prescription that a failure to do so prevents ad-\njustment of status.\n   The Court suggests that the statute compels its conclu-\nsion because otherwise \u201c[w]hether an alien\u2019s motion will\nbe adjudicated within the 60-day statutory period in all\nlikelihood will depend on pure happenstance\u2014namely, the\nbacklog of the particular Board member to whom the\nmotion is assigned\u201d and because \u201carbitrary results are \u2018not\nto be presumed lightly.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 15. It is, however, a\nhappenstance that the alien embraces when he makes his\ncommitment to leave, and its effect upon him is therefore\nnot arbitrary. If he wants to be sure to have his motion to\nreopen considered, he should not enter into the voluntary\ndeparture agreement. A reading of the statute that per-\nmits that avoidable happenstance seems to me infinitely\nmore plausible than a reading that turns a commitment to\ndepart into an option to depart.\n   But the most problematic of all the Court\u2019s reasons for\nallowing petitioner to withdraw his motion to depart\nvoluntarily is its reliance on the Department of Justice\u2019s\n(DOJ) as-yet-unadopted proposal that is in some respects\n(though not the crucial one) similar to the Court\u2019s rule.\nSee ante, at 17\u201318 (citing Proposed Rules, DOJ, Executive\nOffice for Immigration Review, Voluntary Departure:\nEffect of a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for\nReview, 72 Fed.

Our administrative law juris-\nprudence is truly in a state of confused degeneration if this\npick-and-choose technique constitutes \u201crespectful\u201d consid-\neration.\n   It must be acknowledged, however, that the Depart-\nment\u2019s proposed regulation has some bearing upon this\ncase: It demonstrates that the agency is actively consider-\ning whether the terms it has prescribed for its discretion-\nary grants of voluntary departure are too harsh and\nshould be revised for the future, perhaps along the very\nlines that the Justices in today\u2019s majority would choose if\nthey were the Attorney General.

See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu-\nral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 866 (1984). More-\nover, the proposed rule, operating only prospectively, makes the ability\nto withdraw part of the deal that the alien accepts, and limits the\nalien\u2019s commitment accordingly. Petitioner\u2019s promise has already been\nmade, and the requirement that he depart within the specified period is\nunconditional.\n                     Cite as: 554 U.

That is true enough.\nWhat does not appear from the Court\u2019s opinion, however,\nis the source of the Court\u2019s authority to increase that\nprobability in flat contradiction to the text of the statute.\nJust as the Government can (absent some other statutory\nrestriction) relieve criminal defendants of their plea\nagreements for one reason or another, the Government\nmay well be able to let aliens who have agreed to depart\nthe country voluntarily repudiate their agreements. This\nCourt lacks such authority, and nothing in the statute\nremotely dictates the result that today\u2019s judgment decrees.\nI would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.2\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE ALITO agrees that the statute does not require the BIA to\n\ngrant petitioner\u2019s motion to withdraw from his agreement to depart\nvoluntarily.

S. ____ (2008). I agree with the Court\nthat the answer to the first question is no. Ante, at 2.\n    As to the second question, the Court\u2019s reasoning escapes\nme. The Court holds as follows: \u201cAbsent a valid regulation\nresolving the dilemma in a different way,\u201d \u201cthe appropriate\nway to reconcile the\u201d relevant provisions of the Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996 \u201cis to allow an alien to withdraw the request for\nvoluntary departure before expiration of the departure\nperiod.\u201d Ante, at 2, 17 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court\napparently does not hold that the statute compels the\nGovernment to permit an alien to withdraw a request for\nvoluntary departure, only that the statute permits that\napproach, a proposition with which I agree.\n    Since the statute does not decide the question whether\nan alien should be permitted to withdraw a voluntary\n2                    DADA v. MUKASEY\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ndeparture request, the authority to make that policy\nchoice rests with the agency. See, e.g., Smiley v. Citibank\n(South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 740\u2013741 (1996)\n(noting the \u201cpresumption that Congress, when it left am-\nbiguity in a statute meant for implementation by an\nagency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved,\nfirst and foremost, by the agency\u201d); Department of Treas-\nury, IRS v. FLRA, 494 U. S. 922, 932\u2013933 (1990) (refusing\nto sustain an agency\u2019s decision on the ground that it was\nbased on \u201ca permissible (though not an inevitable) con-\nstruction of [a] statute,\u201d because the agency should define\nand adopt that construction \u201cin the first instance\u201d). Ac-\ncordingly, at the time of the decision in petitioner\u2019s case,\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) had the\nauthority (a) to adopt the majority\u2019s automatic withdrawal\nrule (indeed, the agency has proposed a regulation to that\neffect, see ante, at 18), (b) to decide that withdrawal\nshould be permitted in certain circumstances, which may\nor may not be present here, or (c) to hold that a motion to\nwithdraw is never appropriate.\n   Neither the BIA nor the Fifth Circuit addressed peti-\ntioner\u2019s motion to withdraw, see ante, at 4, and therefore\nthe ground for the Board\u2019s decision is unclear. I would\naffirm if the BIA either chose as a general matter not to\npermit the withdrawal of requests for voluntary departure\nor decided that permitting withdrawal was not appropri-\nate under the facts of this case. However, if the BIA re-\njected the withdrawal request on the ground that it lacked\nthe statutory authority to permit it, the Board erred.\nBecause the ground for the BIA\u2019s decision is uncertain, I\nwould vacate and remand.\n",

Heytens, Assistant to the Solicitor General, Donald E. Keener, Quynh Bain, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We decide in this case whether an alien who has requested and been granted voluntary departure from the United States, a form of discretionary relief that avoids certain statutory penalties, must adhere to that election and depart within the time prescribed, even if doing so causes the alien to forgo a ruling on a pending, unresolved motion to reopen the removal proceedings. The case turns upon the interaction of relevant provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (IIRIRA or Act). The Act provides that every alien ordered removed from the United States has a right to file one motion to reopen his or her removal proceedings. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The statute also provides, however, that if the alien's request for voluntary departure is granted after he or she is found removable, the alien is required to depart within the period prescribed by immigration officials, which cannot exceed 60 days. See \u00a7 1229c(b)(2) (2000 ed.). Failure to depart within the prescribed period renders the alien ineligible for certain forms of relief, including adjustment of status, for a period of 10 years. \u00a7 1229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Pursuant to regulation, however, departure has the effect of withdrawing the motion to reopen. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(d) (2007).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2311</span> Without some means, consistent with the Act, to reconcile the two commands \u0097 one directing voluntary departure and the other directing termination of the motion to reopen if an alien departs the United States \u0097 an alien who seeks reopening has two poor choices: The alien can remain in the United States to ensure the motion to reopen remains pending, while incurring statutory penalties for overstaying the voluntary departure date; or the alien can avoid penalties by prompt departure but abandon the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p>The issue is whether Congress intended the statutory right to reopen to be qualified by the voluntary departure process. The alien, who is petitioner here, urges that filing a motion to reopen tolls the voluntary departure period pending the motion's disposition. We reject this interpretation because it would reconfigure the voluntary departure scheme in a manner inconsistent with the statutory design. We do not have the authority to interpret the statute as petitioner suggests. Still, the conflict between the right to file a motion to reopen and the provision requiring voluntary departure no later than 60 days remains untenable if these are the only two choices available to the alien. Absent a valid regulation resolving the dilemma in a different way, we conclude the alien must be permitted an opportunity to withdraw the motion for voluntary departure, provided the request is made before the departure period expires. Petitioner attempted to avail himself of this opportunity below. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did not disturb the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA or Board) denial of petitioner's request to withdraw the voluntary departure election. We now reverse its decision and remand the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Samson Taiwo Dada, a native and citizen of Nigeria, came to the United States in April 1998 on a temporary nonimmigrant visa. He overstayed it. In 1999, petitioner alleges, he married an American citizen. Petitioner's wife filed an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative on his behalf. The necessary documentary evidence was not provided, however, and the petition was denied in February 2003.</p>\n<p>In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) charged petitioner with being removable under \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 201, as amended, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) (2000 ed., Supp. V), for overstaying his visa. Petitioner's wife then filed a second I-130 petition. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied petitioner's request for a continuance pending adjudication of the newly filed I-130 petition and noted that those petitions take an average of about three years to process. The IJ found petitioner to be removable but granted the request for voluntary departure under \u00a7 1229c(b) (2000 ed.). The BIA affirmed on November 4, 2005, without a written opinion. It ordered petitioner to depart within 30 days or suffer statutory penalties, including a civil fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 and ineligibility for relief under \u00a7\u00a7 240A, 240B, 245, 248, and 249 of the INA for a period of 10 years. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5-6.</p>\n<p>Two days before expiration of the 30-day period, on December 2, 2005, petitioner sought to withdraw his request for voluntary departure. At the same time he filed with the BIA a motion to reopen removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V). He contended that his motion recited new and material evidence demonstrating a bona fide marriage and that his case should be continued until the second I-130 petition was resolved.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2312</span> On February 8, 2006, more than two months after the voluntary departure period expired, the BIA denied the motion to reopen on the ground that petitioner had overstayed his voluntary departure period. Under \u00a7 240B(d) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), the BIA reasoned, an alien who has been granted voluntary departure but fails to depart in a timely fashion is statutorily barred from applying for and receiving certain forms of discretionary relief, including adjustment of status. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4. The BIA did not address petitioner's motion to withdraw his request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. <i>Dada v.

The Fifth Circuit joined the First and Fourth Circuits in concluding that there is no automatic tolling of the voluntary departure period. See <i>Chedad v.

Also after oral argument, on January 10, 2008, petitioner's second I-130 application was denied by the IJ on the ground that his marriage is a sham, contracted solely to obtain immigration benefits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Resolution of the questions presented turns on the interaction of two statutory schemes \u0097 the statutory right to file a motion to reopen in removal proceedings; and the rules governing voluntary departure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Voluntary departure is a discretionary form of relief that allows certain favored aliens \u0097 either before the conclusion of removal proceedings or after being found deportable \u0097 to leave the country willingly. Between 1927 to 2005, over 42 million aliens were granted voluntary departure; almost 13 million of those departures occurred between 1996 and 2005 alone. See Dept. of Homeland Security, Aliens Expelled: Fiscal Years 1892 to 2005, Table 38 (2005), online at http://www.dhs.gov/ ximgtn/statistics/ publications/YrBk05En.shtm (all Internet materials as visited June 13, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).</p>\n<p>Voluntary departure was \"originally developed by administrative officers, in the absence of a specific mandate in the statute.\" 6 C. Gordon, S. Mailman, &amp; S. Yale-Loehr, Immigration Law and Procedure \u00a7 74.02[1], p. 74-15 (rev. ed.2007) (hereinafter Gordon). The practice was first codified in the Alien Registration Act of 1940, \u00a7 20, 54 Stat. 671. The Alien Registration Act amended \u00a7 19 of the Immigration Act of Feb. 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 889, to provide that an alien \"deportable under any law of the United States and who has proved good moral character for the preceding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2313</span> five years\" may be permitted by the Attorney General to \"depart the United States to any country of his choice at his own expense, in lieu of deportation.\" \u00a7 20(c), 54 Stat. 672.</p>\n<p>In 1996, perhaps in response to criticism of immigration officials who had expressed frustration that aliens granted voluntary departure were \"permitted to continue their illegal presence in the United States for months, and even years,\" Letter from Benjamin G. Habberton, Acting Commissioner on Immigration and Naturalization, to the Executive Director of the President's Commission on Immigration and Naturalization, reprinted in Hearings before the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 1954 (Comm. Print 1952), Congress curtailed the period of time during which an alien may remain in the United States pending voluntary departure. The Act, as pertinent to voluntary departures requested at the conclusion of removal proceedings, provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Attorney General may permit an alien voluntarily to depart the United States at the alien's own expense if, at the conclusion of a proceeding under section 1229a of this title, the immigration judge enters an order granting voluntary departure in lieu of removal and finds that \u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) the alien has been physically present in the United States for a period of at least one year immediately preceding the date the notice to appear was served under section 1229(a) of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) the alien is, and has been, a person of good moral character for at least 5 years immediately preceding the alien's application for voluntary departure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) the alien is not deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) or section 1227(a)(4) of this title; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(D) the alien has established by clear and convincing evidence that the alien has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<p>See also \u00a7 1229c(a)(1) (\"The Attorney General may permit an alien voluntarily to depart the United States at the alien's own expense under this subsection\" in lieu of being subject to removal proceedings or prior to the completion of those proceedings; the alien need not meet the requirements of \u00a7 1229c(b)(1) if removability is conceded).</p>\n<p>When voluntary departure is requested at the conclusion of removal proceedings, as it was in this case, the statute provides a voluntary departure period of not more than 60 days. See \u00a7 1229c(b)(2). The alien can receive up to 120 days if he or she concedes removability and requests voluntary departure before or during removal proceedings. See \u00a7 1229c(a)(2)(A). Appropriate immigration authorities may extend the time to depart but only if the voluntary departure period is less than the statutory maximum in the first instance. The voluntary departure period in no event may exceed 60 or 120 days for \u00a7 1229c(b) and \u00a7 1229c(a) departures, respectively. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1240.26(f) (2007) (\"Authority to extend the time within which to depart voluntarily specified initially by an immigration judge or the Board is only within the jurisdiction of the district director, the Deputy Executive Associate Commissioner for Detention and Removal, or the Director of the Office of Juvenile Affairs .... In no event can the total period of time, including any extension, exceed 120 days or 60 days as set forth in section 240B of the Act\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2314</span> The voluntary departure period typically does not begin to run until administrative appeals are concluded. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(47)(B) (\"The order ... shall become final upon the earlier of \u0097 (i) a determination by the Board of Immigration Appeals affirming such order; or (ii) the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review of such order by the Board of Immigration Appeals\"); \u00a7 1229c(b)(1) (Attorney General may permit voluntary departure at conclusion of removal proceedings); see also 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.6(a) (2007) (\"[T]he decision in any proceeding ... from which an appeal to the Board may be taken shall not be executed during the time allowed for the filing of an appeal ... \"). In addition some Federal Courts of Appeals have found that they may stay voluntary departure pending consideration of a petition for review on the merits. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Thapa v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795417\"><a href=\"/opinion/795417/deu-thapa-v-alberto-gonzales-attorney-general-of-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 329-332 (C.A.2 2006); <i>Obale v.

This issue is not presented here, however, and we leave its resolution for another day.</p>\n<p>Voluntary departure, under the current structure, allows the Government and the alien to agree upon a <i>quid pro quo.</i> From the Government's standpoint, the alien's agreement to leave voluntarily expedites the departure process and avoids the expense of deportation \u0097 including procuring necessary documents and detaining the alien pending deportation. The Government also eliminates some of the costs and burdens associated with litigation over the departure. With the apparent purpose of assuring that the Government attains the benefits it seeks, the Act imposes limits on the time for voluntary departure, see <i>supra,</i> at 2313, and prohibits judicial review of voluntary departure decisions, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229c(f) and 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>Benefits to the alien from voluntary departure are evident as well. He or she avoids extended detention pending completion of travel arrangements; is allowed to choose when to depart (subject to certain constraints); and can select the country of destination. And, of great importance, by departing voluntarily the alien facilitates the possibility of readmission. The practice was first justified as involving \"no warrant of deportation ... so that if [the alien reapplies] for readmission in the proper way he will not be barred.\" 2 National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement: Report on the Enforcement of the Deportation Laws of the United States 57, 102-103 (1931) (Report No. 5). The current statute likewise allows an alien who voluntarily departs to sidestep some of the penalties attendant to deportation. Under the current Act, an alien involuntarily removed from the United States is ineligible for readmission for a period of 5, 10, or 20 years, depending upon the circumstances of removal. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(i) (\"Any alien who has been ordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title or at the end of proceedings under section 1229a of this title initiated upon the alien's arrival in the United States and who again seeks admission within 5 years of the date of such removal (or within 20 years in the case of a second or subsequent removal ...) is inadmissible\"); \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii) (\"Any alien not described in clause (i) who \u0097 (I) has been ordered removed under section [240] or any other provision of law, or (II) departed the United States while an order of removal was outstanding, and who seeks admission within 10 years of the date of such alien's departure or removal ... is inadmissible\"). An alien who makes a timely departure under a grant of voluntary departure, on the other hand, is not subject to these restrictions \u0097 although he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2315</span> or she otherwise may be ineligible for readmission based, for instance, on an earlier unlawful presence in the United States, see \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>A motion to reopen is a form of procedural relief that \"asks the Board to change its decision in light of newly discovered evidence or a change in circumstances since the hearing.\" 1 Gordon \u00a7 3.05[8][c]. Like voluntary departure, reopening is a judicial creation later codified by federal statute. An early reference to the procedure was in 1916, when a Federal District Court addressed an alien's motion to reopen her case to provide evidence of her marriage to a United States citizen. See <i>Ex parte Chan Shee,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span> (N.D.Cal. 1916); see also <i>Chew Hoy Quong v.

Proctor,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></span>, 883 (C.A.9 1935).</p>\n<p>In 1958, when the BIA was established, the Attorney General promulgated a rule for the reopening and reconsideration of removal proceedings, 8 CFR \u00a7 3.2, upon which the current regulatory provision is based. See 23 Fed.Reg. 9115, 9118-9119 (1958), final rule codified at 8 CFR \u00a7 3.2 (1959) (\"The Board may on its own motion reopen or reconsider any case in which it has rendered a decision\" upon a \"written motion\"); see also Board of Immigration Appeals: Powers; and Reopening or Reconsideration of Cases, 27 Fed.Reg. 96-97 (Jan. 5, 1962). Until 1996, there was no time limit for requesting the reopening of a case due to the availability of new evidence.</p>\n<p>Then, in 1990, \"fear[ful] that deportable or excludable aliens [were] try[ing] to prolong their stays in the U.S. by filing one type of discretionary relief ... after another in immigration proceedings,\" Justice Dept. Finds Aliens Not Abusing Requests for Relief, 68 No. 27 Interpreter Releases 907 (July 22, 1991), Congress ordered the Attorney General to \"issue regulations with respect to ... the period of time in which motions to reopen ... may be offered in deportation proceedings,\" including \"a limitation on the number of such motions that may be filed and a maximum time period for the filing of such motions,\" \u00a7 545(d)(1), 104 Stat. 5066. The Attorney General found little evidence of abuse, concluding that requirements for reopening are a disincentive to bad faith filings. See 68 Interpreter Releases, <i>supra.</i> Because \"Congress ... neither rescinded [n]or amended its mandate to limit the number and time frames of motions,\" however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a regulation imposing new time limits and restrictions on filings. The new regulation allowed the alien to file one motion to reopen within 90 days. Executive Office for Immigration Review; Motions and Appeals in Immigration Proceedings, 61 Fed. Reg. 18900, 18901, 18905 (1996); see 8 CFR \u00a7 3.2(c) (1996).</p>\n<p>With the 1996 enactment of the Act, Congress adopted the recommendations of the DOJ with respect to numerical and time limits. The current provision governing motions to reopen states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(A) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"An alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) Contents</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2316</span> \"The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) Deadline</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) \"In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Except as provided in this subparagraph, the motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp.V).</blockquote>\n<p>To qualify as \"new,\" \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B), the facts must be \"material\" and of the sort that \"could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing,\" 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (2007); 1 Gordon \u00a7 3.05[8][c] (\"Evidence is not previously unavailable merely because the movant chose not to testify or to present evidence earlier, or because the IJ refused to admit the evidence\"). There are narrow exceptions to the 90-day filing period for asylum proceedings and claims of battered spouses, children, and parents, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii), (iv) (2000 ed., Supp. V), which are not applicable here.</p>\n<p>The Act, to be sure, limits in significant ways the availability of the motion to reopen. It must be noted, though, that the Act transforms the motion to reopen from a regulatory procedure to a statutory form of relief available to the alien. Nowhere in \u00a7 1229c(b) or \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) did Congress discuss the impact of the statutory right to file a motion to reopen on a voluntary departure agreement. And no legislative history indicates what some Members of Congress might have intended with respect to the motion's status once the voluntary departure period has elapsed. But the statutory text is plain insofar as it guarantees to each alien the right to file \"one motion to reopen proceedings under this section.\" \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Government argues that, by requesting and obtaining permission to voluntarily depart, the alien knowingly surrenders the opportunity to seek reopening. See Brief for Respondent 29-30. Further, according to the Government, petitioner's proposed rule for tolling the voluntary departure period would undermine the \"carefully crafted rules governing voluntary departure,\" including the statutory directive that these aliens leave promptly. <i>Id.,</i> at 18, 46-47.</p>\n<p>To be sure, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(2) contains no ambiguity: The period within which the alien may depart voluntarily \"shall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days.\" See also 8 CFR \u00a7 1240.26(f) (2007) (\"In no event can the total period of time, including any extension, exceed\" the statutory periods prescribed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(a) and \u00a7 1229c(b)); \u00a7 1229c(d) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (imposing statutory penalties for failure to depart). Further, \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) does not forbid a scheme under which an alien knowingly relinquishes the right to seek reopening in exchange for other benefits, including those available to the alien under the voluntary departure statute. That does not describe this case, however. Nothing in the statutes or past usage with respect to voluntary departure or motions to reopen indicates they cannot coexist. Neither \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) nor \u00a7 1229c(b)(2) says anything about the filing of a motion to reopen by an alien who has requested and been granted the opportunity to voluntarily depart. And there is no other statutory language that would place the alien on notice of an inability to seek the case's reopening in the event of newly discovered evidence or changed circumstances <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2317</span> bearing upon eligibility for relief.</p>\n<p>In reading a statute we must not \"look merely to a particular clause,\" but consider \"in connection with it the whole statute.\" <i>Kokoszka v.

It would render the statutory right to seek reopening a nullity in most cases of voluntary departure. (And this group is not insignificant in number; between 2002 and 2006, 897,267 aliens were found removable, of which 122,866, or approximately 13.7%, were granted voluntary departure. See DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, FY 2006 Statistical Year Book, at Q 1 (Feb.2007).) It is foreseeable, and quite likely, that the time allowed for voluntary departure will expire long before the BIA issues a decision on a timely filed motion to reopen. See Proposed Rules, DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 72 Fed.Reg. 67674, 67677, and n. 2 (2007) (\"As a practical matter, it is often the case that an immigration judge or the Board cannot reasonably be expected to adjudicate a motion to reopen or reconsider during the voluntary departure period\"). These practical limitations must be taken into account. In the present case the BIA denied petitioner's motion to reopen 68 days after he filed the motion \u0097 and 66 days after his voluntary departure period had expired. Although the record contains no statistics on the average disposition time for motions to reopen, the number of BIA proceedings has increased over the last two decades, doubling between 1992 and 2000 alone; and, as a result, the BIA's backlog has more than tripled, resulting in a total of 63,763 undecided cases in 2000. See Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP, Study Conducted for: the American Bar Association Commission on Immigration Policy, Practice and Pro Bono Re: Board of Immigration Appeals: Procedural Reforms to Improve Case Management 13 (2003), online at http://www.dorsey. com/files/upload/DorseyStudyABA_8mgPDF.pdf.</p>\n<p>Since 2000, the BIA has adopted new procedures to reduce its backlog and shorten disposition times. In 2002, the DOJ introduced rules to improve case management, including an increase in the number of cases referred to a single Board member and use of summary disposition procedures for cases without basis in law or fact. See BIA: Procedural Reforms to Improve Case Management, 67 Fed.Reg. 54878 (2002), final rule codified at 8 CFR \u00a7 1003 (2006); see also \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (summary affirmance procedures). Nevertheless, on September 30, 2005, there were 33,063 cases pending before the BIA, 18% <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2318</span> of which were more than a year old. See FY 2006 Statistical Year Book, <i>supra,</i> at U1. On September 30, 2006, approximately 20% of the cases pending had been filed during fiscal year 2005. See <i>ibid.</i> Whether an alien's motion will be adjudicated within the 60-day statutory period in all likelihood will depend on pure happenstance \u0097 namely, the backlog of the particular Board member to whom the motion is assigned. Cf. <i>United States v. Wilson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112711\"><a href=\"/opinion/112711/united-states-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></a></span>, 334, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992) (arbitrary results are \"not to be presumed lightly\").</p>\n<p>Absent tolling or some other remedial action by the Court, then, the alien who is granted voluntary departure but whose circumstances have changed in a manner cognizable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and Charybdis: He or she can leave the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order; but, pursuant to regulation, the motion to reopen will be deemed withdrawn. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(d); see also 23 Fed.Reg. 9115, 9118, final rule codified at 8 CFR \u00a7 3.2 (1958). Alternatively, if the alien wishes to pursue reopening and remains in the United States to do so, he or she risks expiration of the statutory period and ineligibility for adjustment of status, the underlying relief sought. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (failure to timely depart renders alien \"ineligible, for a period of 10 years,\" for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 240A, adjustment of status under \u00a7 245, change of nonimmigrant status under \u00a7 248, and registry under \u00a7 249 of the INA); see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4 (treating petitioner's motion to reopen as forfeited for failure to depart).</p>\n<p>The purpose of a motion to reopen is to ensure a proper and lawful disposition. We must be reluctant to assume that the voluntary departure statute was designed to remove this important safeguard for the distinct class of deportable aliens most favored by the same law. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229c(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (barring aliens who have committed, <i>inter alia,</i> aggravated felonies or terrorism offenses from receiving voluntary departure); \u00a7 1229c(b)(1)(B) (requiring an alien who obtains voluntary departure at the conclusion of removal proceedings to demonstrate \"good moral character\"). This is particularly so when the plain text of the statute reveals no such limitation. See <i>Costello v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106744\"><a href=\"/opinion/106744/costello-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 127-128, 84 S.Ct. 580, 11 L.Ed.2d 559 (1964) (counseling long hesitation \"before adopting a construction of [the statute] which would, with respect to an entire class of aliens, completely nullify a procedure so intrinsic a part of the legislative scheme\"); see also <i>Stone v.

Petitioner, as noted, proposes automatic tolling of the voluntary departure period during the pendency <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2319</span> of the motion to reopen. We do not find statutory authority for this result. Voluntary departure is an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like a settlement agreement. In return for anticipated benefits, including the possibility of readmission, an alien who requests voluntary departure represents that he or she \"has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so\" promptly. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(1)(D); 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1240.26(c)(1)(2) (2007); cf. \u00a7 1240.26(c)(3) (the judge may impose additional conditions to \"ensure the alien's timely departure from the United States\"). Included among the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually depart, within the 60-day period. Cf. <i>United States v. Brockamp,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118083\"><a href=\"/opinion/118083/united-states-v-brockamp/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 352, 117 S.Ct. 849, 136 L.Ed.2d 818 (1997) (substantive limitations are not subject to equitable tolling). If the alien is permitted to stay in the United States past the departure date to wait out the adjudication of the motion to reopen, he or she cannot then demand the full benefits of voluntary departure; for the benefit to the Government \u0097 a prompt and costless departure \u0097 would be lost. Furthermore, it would invite abuse by aliens who wish to stay in the country but whose cases are not likely to be reopened by immigration authorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Although a statute or regulation might be adopted to resolve the dilemma in a different manner, as matters now stand the appropriate way to reconcile the voluntary departure and motion to reopen provisions is to allow an alien to withdraw the request for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period.</p>\n<p>The DOJ, which has authority to adopt regulations relevant to the issue at hand, has made a preliminary determination that the Act permits an alien to withdraw an application for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period. According to this proposal, there is nothing in the Act or the implementing regulations that makes the grant of voluntary departure irrevocable. See 72 Fed.Reg. 67679. Accordingly, the DOJ has proposed an amendment to 8 CFR \u00a7 1240.26 that, prospectively, would \"provide for the automatic termination of a grant of voluntary departure upon the timely filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider, as long as the motion is filed prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period.\" 72 Fed. Reg. 67679, Part IV-D; cf. <i>id.,</i> at 67682, Part VI (\"The provisions of this proposed rule will be applied prospectively only, that is, only with respect to immigration judge orders issued on or after the effective date of the final rule that grant a period of voluntary departure\"). Although not binding in the present case, the DOJ's proposed interpretation of the statutory and regulatory scheme as allowing an alien to withdraw from a voluntary departure agreement \"warrants respectful consideration.\" <i>Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs. v. Blumer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118481\"><a href=\"/opinion/118481/wisconsindept-of-health-and-family-servs-v-blumer/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 497, 122 S.Ct. 962, 151 L.Ed.2d 935 (2002) (citing <i>United States v.

As a result, the alien has the option either to abide by the terms, and receive the agreed-upon benefits, of voluntary departure; or, alternatively, to forgo <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2320</span> those benefits and remain in the United States to pursue an administrative motion.</p>\n<p>If the alien selects the latter option, he or she gives up the possibility of readmission and becomes subject to the IJ's alternate order of removal. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1240.26(d). The alien may be removed by the Department of Homeland Security within 90 days, even if the motion to reopen has yet to be adjudicated. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(A). But the alien may request a stay of the order of removal, see BIA Practice Manual \u00a7 6.3(a), online at http:// www.usdoj.gov/eoir/vll/ qapracmanual/apptmtn4.htm; cf. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C) (providing that a removal order entered <i>in absentia</i> is stayed automatically pending a motion to reopen); and, though the BIA has discretion to deny the motion for a stay, it may constitute an abuse of discretion for the BIA to do so where the motion states nonfrivolous grounds for reopening.</p>\n<p>Though this interpretation still confronts the alien with a hard choice, it avoids both the quixotic results of the Government's proposal and the elimination of benefits to the Government that would follow from petitioner's tolling rule. Contrary to the Government's assertion, the rule we adopt does not alter the <i>quid pro quo</i> between the Government and the alien. If withdrawal is requested prior to expiration of the voluntary departure period, the alien has not received benefits without costs; the alien who withdraws from a voluntary departure arrangement is in the same position as an alien who was not granted voluntary departure in the first instance. Allowing aliens to withdraw from their voluntary departure agreements, moreover, establishes a greater probability that their motions to reopen will be considered. At the same time, it gives some incentive to limit filings to nonfrivolous motions to reopen; for aliens with changed circumstances of the type envisioned by Congress in drafting \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) are the ones most likely to forfeit their previous request for voluntary departure in return for the opportunity to adjudicate their motions. Cf. Supplemental Brief for Respondent 1-2 (\"[I]t is extraordinarily rare for an alien who has requested and been granted voluntary departure by the BIA to seek to withdraw from that arrangement within the voluntary departure period\").</p>\n<p>A more expeditious solution to the untenable conflict between the voluntary departure scheme and the motion to reopen might be to permit an alien who has departed the United States to pursue a motion to reopen postdeparture, much as Congress has permitted with respect to judicial review of a removal order. See IIRIRA \u00a7 306(b), 110 Stat. 3009-612 (repealing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c) (1994 ed.), which prohibited an alien who \"departed from the United States after the issuance of the order\" to seek judicial review). As noted previously, 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(d) provides that the alien's departure constitutes withdrawal of the motion to reopen. This regulation, however, has not been challenged in these proceedings, and we do not consider it here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Petitioner requested withdrawal of his motion for voluntary departure prior to expiration of his 30-day departure period. The BIA should have granted this request, without regard to the merits of petitioner's I-130 petition, and permitted petitioner to pursue his motion to reopen. We find this same mistake implicit in the Court of Appeals' decision. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2321</span> Justice SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice THOMAS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The statutory provision at issue here authorizes the Attorney General to permit an alien who has been found deportable, if he so requests, to depart the country voluntarily. This enables the alien to avoid detention pending involuntary deportation, to select his own country of destination, to leave according to his own schedule (within the prescribed period), and to avoid restrictions upon readmission that attend involuntary departure. The statute specifies that the permission \"shall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days,\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(2), and that failure to depart within the prescribed period causes the alien to be ineligible for certain relief, including adjustment of status, for 10 years, \u00a7 1229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Moreover, pursuant to a regulation that the Court accepts as valid, departure (whether voluntary or involuntary) terminates the alien's ability to move for reopening of his removal proceeding, and withdraws any such motion filed before his departure. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(d) (2007). All of these provisions were in effect when petitioner agreed to depart, and the Court cites no statute or regulation currently in force that permits an alien who has agreed voluntarily to depart to change his mind. Yet the Court holds that petitioner must be permitted to renounce that agreement (the opinion dresses this up as \"withdraw[ing] the motion for voluntary departure\") provided the request is made before the departure period expires. <i>Ante,</i> at 2311. That is \"necessary,\" the Court says, to \"preserve the alien's right to pursue reopening,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2318, forfeiture of which was the known consequence of the departure he had agreed to. The Court's perceived \"necessity\" does not exist, and the Court lacks the authority to impose its chosen remedy. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Court is resolute in its belief that there is a \"conflict between the right to file a motion to reopen and the provision requiring voluntary departure no later than 60 days.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2311. The statute cannot be interpreted to put the alien to the choice of either (1) \"remain[ing] in the United States to ensure [his] motion to reopen remains pending, while incurring statutory penalties for overstaying the voluntary departure date\" or (2) \"avoid[ing] penalties by prompt departure but abandon[ing] the motion to reopen.\" <i>Ibid.</i> This, according to the Court, would \"render the statutory right to seek reopening a nullity in most cases of voluntary departure.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2316-2317. Indeed, the problem is of mythological proportions: \"[T]he alien who is granted voluntary departure but whose circumstances have changed in a manner cognizable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and Charybdis: He or she can leave the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order; but, pursuant to regulation, the motion to reopen will be deemed withdrawn.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2318. So certain is the Court of this premise that it is asserted no less than seven times during the course of today's opinion. See <i>ante,</i> at 2311, 2316, 2317-2320.</p>\n<p>The premise is false. It would indeed be extraordinary (though I doubt it would justify a judicial rewrite) for a statute to impose that stark choice upon an alien: depart and lose your right to seek reopening, or stay and incur statutory penalties. But that is <i>not</i> the choice this statute imposes. It offers the alien a deal, if he finds it in his interest and wishes to take it: \"Agree to depart voluntarily (within the specified period, of course) and you may lose your right to pursue reopening, but you will not suffer detention, you can <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2322</span> depart at your own convenience rather than ours, and to the destination that you rather than we select, and you will not suffer the statutory restrictions upon reentry that accompany involuntary departure. If you accept this deal, however, but do not live up to it\u0097if you fail to depart as promised within the specified period\u0097you will become ineligible for cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, and voluntary departure.\" Seems entirely reasonable to me. Litigants are put to similar voluntary choices between the rock and the whirlpool all the time, without cries for a judicial rewrite of the law. It happens, for example, whenever a criminal defendant is offered a plea bargain that gives him a lesser sentence than he might otherwise receive but deprives him of his right to trial by jury and his right to appeal. It is indeed utterly commonplace that <i>electing</i> to pursue one avenue of relief may require the surrender of certain other remedies.</p>\n<p>Petitioner requested and accepted the above described deal, but now\u0097to put the point bluntly but entirely accurately\u0097he wants to back out. The case is as simple as that. Two days before the deadline for his promised voluntary departure, he filed a motion asking the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to reopen his removal proceedings and remand his case to the Immigration Judge for adjustment of status based on his wife's pending visa petition. Administrative Record 3; see <i>id.,</i> at 8-21. The motion also asked the BIA to \"withdraw his request for voluntary departure\" and \"instead accep[t] an order of deportation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 10. After the voluntary departure period expired, the BIA denied petitioner's motion to reopen, explaining that under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), \"an alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure... is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that the BIA proceeded just as it should have, and just as petitioner had every reason to expect. To be sure, the statute provides for the right to file (and presumably to have ruled upon in due course) a petition to reopen. But it does not forbid the relinquishment of that right in exchange for other benefits that the BIA has discretion to provide. Nor does it suggest any weird departure from the ancient rule that an offer (the offer to depart voluntarily in exchange for specified benefits, and with specified consequences for default) cannot be \"withdrawn\" after it has been accepted and after the <i>quid pro quo</i> promise (to depart) has been made.</p>\n<p>The Court's rejection of this straightforward analysis is inconsistent with its treatment of petitioner's argument that the statute requires automatic tolling of the voluntary departure period while a motion to reopen is pending. With respect to that argument, the Court says:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Voluntary departure is an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like a settlement agreement. In return for anticipated benefits, including the possibility of readmission, an alien who requests voluntary departure represents that he or she `has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so' promptly. Included among the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually depart, within the 60-day period.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2318-2319 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Precisely so. But also among the substantive burdens is the inability to receive certain relief through a motion to reopen once the promised departure date has passed; and perhaps paramount among the substantive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2323</span> burdens is that the alien is <i>bound</i> to his agreement. The Court is quite right that the Act does not allow us to require that an alien who agrees to depart voluntarily must receive the benefits of his bargain without the costs. But why does it allow us to convert the alien's statutorily required promise to depart voluntarily into an \"option either to abide by the terms, and receive the agreed-upon benefits, of voluntary departure; or, alternatively, to forgo those benefits and remain in the United States to pursue an administrative motion\"? <i>Ante,</i> at 2319. And why does it allow us to nullify the provision of \u00a7 1229c(d)(1) that failure to depart within the prescribed and promised period causes the alien to be ineligible for certain relief, including adjustment of status (which is what petitioner seeks here) for 10 years?</p>\n<p>Of course it is not unusual for the Court to blue-pencil a statute in this fashion, directing that one of its provisions, severable from the rest, be disregarded. But that is done when the blue-penciled provision is <i>unconstitutional.</i> It would be unremarkable, if the Court found that the alien had a constitutional right to reopen, and that conditioning permission for voluntary departure upon waiver of that right was an unconstitutional condition, for the Court to order that the alien cannot be held to his commitment. But that is not the case here. The Court holds that the plain requirement of the statute and of validly adopted regulations cannot be enforced <i>because the statute itself forbids it.</i></p>\n<p>Not so. The Court derives this prohibition from its belief that an alien must, no matter what, be given the full benefit of the right to reopen, even if that means creating an extrastatutory option to renege upon the statutorily contemplated agreement to depart voluntarily. \"We must be reluctant to assume,\" the Court says, \"that the voluntary departure statute was designed to remove this important safeguard [of the motion to reopen],\" \"particularly so when the plain text of the statute reveals no such limitation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2318. But in fact that safeguard is not sacrosanct. The \"plain text of the statute\" does <i>cause</i> voluntary departure to remove that safeguard for at least 30 days of its 90-day existence, and <i>permits</i> voluntary departure to remove it almost entirely. Section 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V) generally permits the filing of a motion to reopen \"within 90 days of ... entry of a final administrative order of removal.\" But as I have described, \u00a7 1229c(b)(2) (2000 ed.) provides that a grant of voluntary departure issued at the conclusion of removal proceedings \"shall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days.\" Since motions to reopen cannot be filed after removal or departure, the unquestionable effect of the statutory scheme is to deprive the alien who agrees to voluntary departure of the (sacrosanct) right to reopen for a full third of its existence. And since 60 days is merely the maximum period for a voluntary departure, it is theoretically possible for the right to reopen to be limited to one week, or even one day. Given that reality, it is not at all hard to believe that the statute allows nullification of motions to reopen requesting adjustment of status filed within the 60-day departure period and not ruled upon before departure. Indeed, it seems to me much more likely that the statute allows that than that it allows judicial imposition of the unheard-of rule that a promise to depart is not a promise to depart, and judicial nullification of a statutorily prescribed penalty for failure to depart by the gimmick of allowing the request for voluntary departure to be \"withdrawn.\"</p>\n<p>The same analysis makes it true that, even under the Court's reconstructed statute, a removable alien's agreement to depart voluntarily may limit, and in some <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2324</span> instances foreclose, his ability to pursue a motion to reopen at a later date. Even if the alien who has agreed to voluntary departure is permitted to renege within the specified departure period, that period can be no longer than 60 days after entry of the order of removal\u0097meaning that he has been deprived of at least 30 days of his right to reopen. Thus, the Court has not \"reconciled\" statutory provisions; it has simply rewritten two of them to satisfy its notion of sound policy\u0097the requirement of a commitment to depart and the prescription that a failure to do so prevents adjustment of status.</p>\n<p>The Court suggests that the statute compels its conclusion because otherwise \"[w]hether an alien's motion will be adjudicated within the 60-day statutory period in all likelihood will depend on pure happenstance\u0097namely, the backlog of the particular Board member to whom the motion is assigned\" and because \"arbitrary results are `not to be presumed lightly.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2318. It is, however, a happenstance that the alien embraces when he makes his commitment to leave, and its effect upon him is therefore not arbitrary. If he wants to be sure to have his motion to reopen considered, he should not enter into the voluntary departure agreement. A reading of the statute that permits that avoidable happenstance seems to me infinitely more plausible than a reading that turns a commitment to depart into an option to depart.</p>\n<p>But the most problematic of all the Court's reasons for allowing petitioner to withdraw his motion to depart voluntarily is its reliance on the Department of Justice's (DOJ) as-yet-unadopted proposal that is in some respects (though not the crucial one) similar to the Court's rule. See <i>ante,</i> at 2319-2320 (citing Proposed Rules, DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 72 Fed.Reg. 67674, 67677, and n. 2 (2007)). I shall assume that the proposed rule would be valid, even though it converts the statutory <i>requirement</i> of departure within the prescribed period (on pain of losing the right to seek adjustment of status) into an <i>option</i> to depart.<sup>[1]</sup> According to the Court, the proposed regulation \"`warrants respectful consideration.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2319-2320. What this evidently means is respectful adoption of that portion of the proposed regulation with which the Court agrees, and <i>sub silentio</i> rejection of that portion it disfavors, namely: \"The provisions of this proposed rule will be applied ... only with respect to immigration judge orders issued on or after the effective date of the final rule that grant a period of voluntary departure,\" 72 Fed.Reg. 67682. See Supp. Brief for Respondent 8-9 (observing that the rule \"will not apply to petitioner's case\"). Our administrative law jurisprudence is truly in a state of confused degeneration if this pick-and-choose technique constitutes \"respectful\" consideration.</p>\n<p>It must be acknowledged, however, that the Department's proposed regulation has some bearing upon this case: It demonstrates that the agency is actively considering whether the terms it has prescribed for its discretionary grants of voluntary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2325</span> departure are too harsh and should be revised for the future, perhaps along the very lines that the Justices in today's majority would choose if they were the Attorney General. It shows, in other words, that today's interpretive gymnastics may have been performed, not for the enjoyment of innumerable aliens in the future, but for Mr. Dada alone.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>In the final analysis, the Court's entire approach to interpreting the statutory scheme can be summed up in this sentence from its opinion: \"Allowing aliens to withdraw from their voluntary departure agreements [ ] establishes a greater probability that their motions to reopen will be considered.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2320. That is true enough. What does not appear from the Court's opinion, however, is the source of the Court's authority to increase that probability in flat contradiction to the text of the statute. Just as the <i>Government</i> can (absent some other statutory restriction) relieve criminal defendants of their plea agreements for one reason or another, the <i>Government</i> may well be able to let aliens who have agreed to depart the country voluntarily repudiate their agreements. This Court lacks such authority, and nothing in the statute remotely dictates the result that today's judgment decrees. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This case presents two questions: (1) \"[w]hether the filing of a motion to reopen removal proceedings automatically tolls the period within which an alien must depart... under an order granting voluntary departure,\" Brief for Petitioner i, and (2) \"[w]hether an alien who has been granted voluntary departure and has filed a timely motion to reopen should be permitted to withdraw the request for voluntary departure prior to the expiration of the departure period,\" 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1116, 169 L.Ed.2d 805 (2008). I agree with the Court that the answer to the first question is no. <i>Ante,</i> at 2311.</p>\n<p>As to the second question, the Court's reasoning escapes me. The Court holds as follows: \"<i>Absent a valid regulation resolving the dilemma in a different way,</i>\" \"the appropriate way to reconcile the\" relevant provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \"is to allow an alien to withdraw the request for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2311, 2319 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court apparently does not hold that the statute compels the Government to permit an alien to withdraw a request for voluntary departure, only that the statute permits that approach, a proposition with which I agree.</p>\n<p>Since the statute does not decide the question whether an alien should be permitted to withdraw a voluntary departure request, the authority to make that policy choice rests with the agency. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118032\"><a href=\"/opinion/118032/smiley-v-citibank-south-dakota-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span>, 740-741, 116 S.Ct. 1730, 135 L.Ed.2d 25 (1996) (noting the \"presumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2326</span> in a statute meant for implementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency\"); <i>Department of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112405\"><a href=\"/opinion/112405/department-of-treasury-irs-v-flra/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span>, 932-933, 110 S.Ct. 1623, 108 L.Ed.2d 914 (1990) (refusing to sustain an agency's decision on the ground that it was based on \"a permissible (though not an inevitable) construction of [a] statute,\" because the agency should define and adopt that construction \"in the first instance\"). Accordingly, at the time of the decision in petitioner's case, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) had the authority (a) to adopt the majority's automatic withdrawal rule (indeed, the agency has proposed a regulation to that effect, see <i>ante,</i> at 2319-2320), (b) to decide that withdrawal should be permitted in certain circumstances, which may or may not be present here, or (c) to hold that a motion to withdraw is never appropriate.</p>\n<p>Neither the BIA nor the Fifth Circuit addressed petitioner's motion to withdraw, see <i>ante,</i> at 2312, and therefore the ground for the Board's decision is unclear. I would affirm if the BIA either chose as a general matter not to permit the withdrawal of requests for voluntary departure or decided that permitting withdrawal was not appropriate under the facts of this case. However, if the BIA rejected the withdrawal request on the ground that it lacked the statutory authority to permit it, the Board erred. Because the ground for the BIA's decision is uncertain, I would vacate and remand.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  An agency need not adopt, as we must, the <i>best</i> reading of a statute, but merely one that is permissible. See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 866, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Moreover, the proposed rule, operating only prospectively, makes the ability to withdraw part of the deal that the alien accepts, and limits the alien's commitment accordingly. Petitioner's promise has already been made, and the requirement that he depart within the specified period is unconditional.</p>\n<p>[2]  Justice ALITO agrees that the statute does not require the BIA to grant petitioner's motion to withdraw from his agreement to depart voluntarily. He chooses to remand the case because the BIA did not give the reason for its denial of the withdrawal motion, and he believes the reason would be the wrong one if the BIA thought it lacked statutory authority to grant. <i>Post,</i> at 2325-2326 (dissenting opinion). But petitioner has challenged neither the adequacy of the BIA's reason for denying his motion, nor the BIA's failure to specify a reason. He has argued only that the statute requires that he be allowed to withdraw.</p>\n\n</div>",
