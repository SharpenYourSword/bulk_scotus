Pimentel and the Class of Human Rights Victims.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case turns on the interpretation and proper application of Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and requires us to address the Rule's operation in the context of foreign sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p>This interpleader action was commenced to determine the ownership of property allegedly stolen by Ferdinand Marcos when he was the President of the Republic of the Philippines. Two entities named in the suit invoked sovereign immunity. They are the Republic of the Philippines and the Philippine Presidential Commission on Good Governance, referred to in turn as the Republic and the Commission. They were dismissed, but the interpleader action proceeded to judgment over their objection. Together with two parties who remained in the suit, the Republic and the Commission now insist it was error to allow the litigation to proceed. Under Rule 19, they contend, the action should have been dismissed once it became clear they could not be joined as parties without their consent.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, agreeing with the District Court, held the action could proceed without the Republic and the Commission as parties. Among the reasons the Court of Appeals gave was that the absent, sovereign entities would not prevail on their claims. We conclude the Court of Appeals gave insufficient weight to the foreign sovereign status of the Republic and the Commission, and that the court further erred in reaching and discounting the merits of their claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>When the opinion of the Court of Appeals is consulted, the reader will find its quotations from Rule 19 do not accord with its text as set out here; for after the case was in the Court of Appeals and before it came here, the text of the Rule changed. The Rules Committee advised the changes were stylistic only, see Advisory Committee's Notes on 2007 Amendment to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19, 28 U.S.C. A., p. 168 (2008); and we agree. These are the three relevant stylistic changes. First, the word \"required\" replaced the word \"necessary\" in subparagraph (a). Second, the 1966 Rule set out factors in longer clauses and the 2007 Rule sets out the factors affecting joinder in separate lettered headings. Third, the word \"indispensable,\" which had remained as a remnant of the pre-1966 Rule, is altogether deleted from the current text. Though the word \"indispensable\" had a lesser place in the 1966 Rule, it still had the latent potential to mislead.</p>\n<p>As the substance and operation of the Rule both pre- and post-2007 are unchanged, we will refer to the present, revised <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2185</span> version. The pre-2007 version is printed in the Appendix of this opinion. The current Rule states, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Rule 19. Required Joinder of Parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(a) Persons Required to Be Joined if Feasible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) Required Party. A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) in that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person's absence may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the interest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Joinder by Court Order. If a person has not been joined as required, the court must order that the person be made a party. A person who refuses to join as a plaintiff may be made either a defendant or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(3) Venue. If a joined party objects to venue and the joinder would make venue improper, the court must dismiss that party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) When Joinder Is Not Feasible. If a person who is required to be joined if feasible cannot be joined, the court must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed. The factors for the court to consider include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) protective provisions in the judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) shaping the relief; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) other measures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(3) whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence would be adequate; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder.\" Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 19(a)-(b).</blockquote>\n<p>See also Rule 19(c) (imposing pleading requirements); Rule 19(d) (creating exception for class actions).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In 1972, Ferdinand Marcos, then President of the Republic, incorporated Arelma, S.A. (Arelma), under Panamanian law. Around the same time, Arelma opened a brokerage account with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. (Merrill Lynch) in New York, in which it deposited $2 million. As of the year 2000, the account had grown to approximately $35 million.</p>\n<p>Alleged crimes and misfeasance by Marcos during his presidency became the subject of worldwide attention and protest. A class action by and on behalf of some 9,539 of his human rights victims was filed against Marcos and his estate, among others. The class action was tried in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii and resulted in a nearly $2 billion judgment for the class. See <i>Hilao v. Estate of Marcos,</i> 103 F.3d 767 (C.A.9 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2186</span> 1996). We refer to that litigation as the Pimentel case and to its class members as the Pimentel class. In a related action, the Estate of Roger Roxas and Golden Budha <i>[sic]</i> Corporation (the Roxas claimants) claim a right to execute against the assets to satisfy their own judgment against Marcos' widow, Imelda Marcos. See <i>Roxas v. Marcos,</i> 89 Hawai`i 91, 113-115, 969 P.2d 1209, 1231-1233 (1998).</p>\n<p>The Pimentel class claims a right to enforce its judgment by attaching the Arelma assets held by Merrill Lynch. The Republic and the Commission claim a right to the assets under a 1955 Philippine law providing that property derived from the misuse of public office is forfeited to the Republic from the moment of misappropriation. See An Act Declaring Forfeiture in Favor of the State Any Property Found To Have Been Unlawfully Acquired by Any Public Officer or Employee and Providing for the Proceedings Therefor, Rep. Act No. 1379, 51:9 O.G. 4457 (June 18, 1955).</p>\n<p>After Marcos fled the Philippines in 1986, the Commission was created to recover any property he wrongfully took. Almost immediately the Commission asked the Swiss Government for assistance in recovering assets\u0097including shares in Arelma\u0097that Marcos had moved to Switzerland. In compliance the Swiss Government froze certain assets and, in 1990, that freeze was upheld by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court. In 1991, the Commission asked the Sandiganbayan, a Philippine court of special jurisdiction over corruption cases, to declare forfeited to the Republic any property Marcos had obtained through misuse of his office. That litigation is still pending in the Sandiganbayan.</p>\n<p>The Swiss assets were transferred to an escrow account set up by the Commission at the Philippine National Banc (PNB), pending the Sandiganbayan's decision as to their rightful owner. The Republic and the Commission requested that Merrill Lynch follow the same course and transfer the Arelma assets to an escrow account at PNB. Merrill Lynch did not do so. Facing claims from various Marcos creditors, including the Pimentel class, Merrill Lynch instead filed an interpleader action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1335. The named defendants in the interpleader action were, among others, the Republic and the Commission, Arelma, PNB, and the Pimentel class (the respondents here).</p>\n<p>The Pimentel case had been tried as a class action before Judge Manuel Real of the United States District Court for the Central District of California, who was sitting by designation in the District of Hawaii after the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the various human rights complaints against Marcos in that court. See <i>Hilao, supra,</i> at 771. Judge Real directed Merrill Lynch to file the interpleader action in the District of Hawaii, and he presided over the matter.</p>\n<p>After being named as defendants in the interpleader action, the Republic and the Commission asserted sovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604. They moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule 19(b), based on the premise that the action could not proceed without them. Arelma and PNB also moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule 19(b). Without addressing whether they were entitled to sovereign immunity, Judge Real initially rejected the request by the Republic and the Commission to dismiss the interpleader action. They appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed. It held the Republic and the Commission are entitled to sovereign immunity and that under Rule 19(a) they are required parties (or \"necessary\" parties under the old terminology). See <i>In re Republic of the Philippines,</i> 309 F.3d 1143, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2187</span> 1149-1152 (C.A.9 2002). The Court of Appeals entered a stay pending the outcome of the litigation in the Sandiganbayan over the Marcos assets. See <i>id.,</i> at 1152-1153.</p>\n<p>After concluding that the pending litigation in the Sandiganbayan could not determine entitlement to the Arelma assets, Judge Real vacated the stay, allowed the action to proceed, and awarded the assets to the Pimentel class. A week later, in the case initiated before the Sandiganbayan in 1991, the Republic asked that court to declare the Arelma assets forfeited, arguing the matter was ripe for decision. The Sandiganbayan has not yet ruled.</p>\n<p>In the interpleader case the Republic, the Commission, Arelma, and PNB appealed the District Court's judgment in favor of the Pimentel claimants. This time the Court of Appeals affirmed. See <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith v. ENC Corp.,</i> 464 F.3d 885 (C.A.9 2006). Dismissal of the interpleader suit, it held, was not warranted under Rule 19(b) because, though the Republic and the Commission were required (\"necessary\") parties under Rule 19(a), their claim had so little likelihood of success on the merits that the interpleader action could proceed without them. One of the reasons the court gave was that any action commenced by the Republic and the Commission to recover the assets would be barred by New York's 6-year statute of limitations for claims involving the misappropriation of public property. See N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7 213 (West Supp.2008). The court thus found it unnecessary to consider whether any prejudice to the Republic and the Commission might be lessened by some form of judgment or interim decree in the interpleader action. The court also considered the failure of the Republic and the Commission to obtain a judgment in the Sandiganbayan\u0097despite the Arelma share certificates having been located and held in escrow at the PNB since 1997-1998\u0097to be an equitable consideration counseling against dismissal of the interpleader suit. The court further found it relevant that allowing the interpleader case to proceed would serve the interests of the Pimentel class, which, at this point, likely has no other available forum in which to enforce its judgment against property belonging to Marcos.</p>\n<p>This Court granted certiorari. See 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 705, 169 L.Ed.2d 552 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We begin with the question we asked the parties to address when we granted certiorari: Whether the Republic and the Commission, having been dismissed from the interpleader action based on their successful assertion of sovereign immunity, had the right to appeal the District Court's determination under Rule 19 that the action could proceed in their absence; and whether they have the right to seek this Court's review of the Court of Appeals' judgment affirming the District Court. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Respondents contend that the Republic and the Commission were not proper parties in the Court of Appeals when it reviewed the District Court's judgment allowing the action to proceed without them; and, respondents continue, the Republic and the Commission are not proper parties in the instant proceeding before us. See Brief for Respondent Pimentel 21.</p>\n<p>Without implying that respondents are correct in saying the Republic and the Commission could neither appeal nor become parties here, we conclude we need not rule on this point. Other parties before us, Arelma and PNB, also seek review of the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the District Court. They, too, moved to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2188</span> dismiss the action under Rule 19(b), appealed from the denial of their motion, and are petitioners before this Court. As a general matter any party may move to dismiss an action under Rule 19(b). A court with proper jurisdiction may also consider <i>sua sponte</i> the absence of a required person and dismiss for failure to join. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co.,</i> 184 U.S. 199, 235, 22 S.Ct. 308, 46 L.Ed. 499 (1902); see also <i>Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patterson,</i> 390 U.S. 102, 111, 88 S.Ct. 733, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968).</p>\n<p>Respondents argue, however, that Arelma and PNB have no standing to raise before this Court the question whether the action may proceed in the absence of the Republic and the Commission. Arelma and PNB lost on the merits of their underlying claims to the interpleaded assets in both the District Court and the Court of Appeals. By failing to petition for certiorari on that merits ruling, respondents contend, Arelma and PNB abandoned any entitlement to the interpleaded assets and therefore lack a concrete stake in the outcome of further proceedings. We disagree. Dismissal of the action under Rule 19(b) would benefit Arelma and PNB by vacating the judgment denying them the interpleaded assets. A party that seeks to have a judgment vacated in its entirety on procedural grounds does not lose standing simply because the party does not petition for certiorari on the substance of the order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We turn to the question whether the interpleader action could proceed in the District Court without the Republic and the Commission as parties.</p>\n<p>Subdivision (a) of Rule 19 states the principles that determine when persons or entities must be joined in a suit. The Rule instructs that nonjoinder even of a required person does not always result in dismissal. Subdivision (a) opens by noting that it addresses joinder \"if Feasible.\" Where joinder is not feasible, the question whether the action should proceed turns on the factors outlined in subdivision (b). The considerations set forth in subdivision (b) are nonexclusive, as made clear by the introductory statement that \"[t]he factors for the court to consider include.\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(b). The general direction is whether \"in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The design of the Rule, then, indicates that the determination whether to proceed will turn upon factors that are case specific, which is consistent with a Rule based on equitable considerations. This is also consistent with the fact that the determination of who may, or must, be parties to a suit has consequences for the persons and entities affected by the judgment; for the judicial system and its interest in the integrity of its processes and the respect accorded to its decrees; and for society and its concern for the fair and prompt resolution of disputes. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois,</i> 431 U.S. 720, 737-739, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977). For these reasons, the issue of joinder can be complex, and determinations are case specific. See, <i>e.g., Provident </i><i>Bank, supra,</i> at 118-119, 88 S.Ct. 733.</p>\n<p>Under the earlier Rules the term \"indispensable party\" might have implied a certain rigidity that would be in tension with this case-specific approach. The word \"indispensable\" had an unforgiving connotation that did not fit easily with a system that permits actions to proceed even when some persons who otherwise should be parties to the action cannot be joined. As the Court noted in <i>Provident Bank,</i> the use of \"indispensable\" in Rule 19 created <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2189</span> the \"verbal anomaly\" of an \"indispensable person who turns out to be dispensable after all.\" 390 U.S., at 117, n. 12, 88 S.Ct. 733. Though the text has changed, the new Rule 19 has the same design and, to some extent, the same tension. Required persons may turn out not to be required for the action to proceed after all.</p>\n<p>In all events it is clear that multiple factors must bear on the decision whether to proceed without a required person. This decision \"must be based on factors varying with the different cases, some such factors being substantive, some procedural, some compelling by themselves, and some subject to balancing against opposing interests.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 119, 88 S.Ct. 733.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>We turn to Rule 19 as it relates to this case. The application of subdivision (a) of Rule 19 is not contested. The Republic and the Commission are required entities because \"[w]ithout [them] as parties in this interpleader action, their interests in the subject matter are not protected.\" <i>In re Republic of Philippines,</i> 309 F.3d, at 1152; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)(1)(B)(i). All parties appear to concede this. The disagreement instead centers around the application of subdivision (b), which addresses whether the action may proceed without the Republic and the Commission, given that the Rule requires them to be parties.</p>\n<p>We have not addressed the standard of review for Rule 19(b) decisions. The case-specific inquiry that must be followed in applying the standards set forth in subdivision (b), including the direction to consider whether \"in equity and good conscience\" the case should proceed, implies some degree of deference to the district court. In this case, however, we find implicit in the District Court's rulings, and explicit in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, errors of law that require reversal. Whatever the appropriate standard of review, a point we need not decide, the judgment could not stand. Cf. <i>Koon v. United States,</i> 518 U.S. 81, 99-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (a court \"by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law\").</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals erred in not giving the necessary weight to the absent entities' assertion of sovereign immunity. The court in effect decided the merits of the Republic and the Commission's claims to the Arelma assets. Once it was recognized that those claims were not frivolous, it was error for the Court of Appeals to address them on their merits when the required entities had been granted sovereign immunity. The court's consideration of the merits was itself an infringement on foreign sovereign immunity; and, in any event, its analysis was flawed. We discuss these errors first in the context of how they affected the Court of Appeals' analysis under the first factor of Rule 19(b). We then explain that the outcome suggested by the first factor is confirmed by our analysis under the other provisions of Rule 19(b). The action may not proceed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As to the first Rule 19(b) factor\u0097the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(b)(1)\u0097the judgment of the Court of Appeals is incorrect.</p>\n<p>In considering whether the Republic and the Commission would be prejudiced if the action were to proceed in their absence, the Court of Appeals gave insufficient weight to their sovereign status. The doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity has been recognized since early in the history of our Nation. It is premised upon the \"perfect equality and absolute independence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2190</span> of sovereigns, and th[e] common interest impelling them to mutual intercourse.\" <i>Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon,</i> 7 Cranch 116, 137, 3 L.Ed. 287 (1812). The Court has observed that the doctrine is designed to \"give foreign states and their instrumentalities some protection from the inconvenience of suit,\" <i>Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson,</i> 538 U.S. 468, 479, 123 S.Ct. 1655, 155 L.Ed.2d 643 (2003).</p>\n<p>The privilege is codified by federal statute. FSIA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330, 1602-1611, provides that \"a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States except as provided in sections 1605 to 1607,\" absent existing international agreements to the contrary. \u00a7 1604; see <i>Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,</i> 461 U.S. 480, 486-489, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983) (explaining the history of the doctrine's codification). Exceptions to the general principle of foreign sovereign immunity are contained in \u00a7\u00a7 1605-1607 of the statute. They are inapplicable here, or at least the parties do not invoke them. Immunity in this case, then, is uncontested; and pursuant to the Court of Appeals' earlier ruling on the issue, the District Court dismissed the Republic and the Commission from the action on this ground.</p>\n<p>The District Court and the Court of Appeals failed to give full effect to sovereign immunity when they held the action could proceed without the Republic and the Commission. Giving full effect to sovereign immunity promotes the comity interests that have contributed to the development of the immunity doctrine. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 486, 103 S.Ct. 1962 (\"[F]oreign sovereign immunity is a matter of grace and comity\"); <i>National City Bank of N.Y. v. Republic of China,</i> 348 U.S. 356, 362, and n. 7, 75 S.Ct. 423, 99 L.Ed. 389 (1955) (foreign sovereign immunity derives from \"standards of public morality, fair dealing, reciprocal self-interest, and respect for the `power and dignity' of the foreign sovereign\" (quoting <i>Schooner Exchange, supra,</i> at 136-137, 143-144)).</p>\n<p>Comity and dignity interests take concrete form in this case. The claims of the Republic and the Commission arise from events of historical and political significance for the Republic and its people. The Republic and the Commission have a unique interest in resolving the ownership of or claims to the Arelma assets and in determining if, and how, the assets should be used to compensate those persons who suffered grievous injury under Marcos. There is a comity interest in allowing a foreign state to use its own courts for a dispute if it has a right to do so. The dignity of a foreign state is not enhanced if other nations bypass its courts without right or good cause. Then, too, there is the more specific affront that could result to the Republic and the Commission if property they claim is seized by the decree of a foreign court. Cf. <i>Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman,</i> 324 U.S. 30, 35-36, 65 S.Ct. 530, 89 L.Ed. 729 (1945) (pre-FSIA, common-law doctrine dictated that courts defer to executive determination of immunity because \"[t]he judicial seizure\" of the property of a friendly state may be regarded as \"an affront to its dignity and may. . . affect our relations with it\").</p>\n<p>Though this Court has not considered a case posing the precise question presented here, there are some authorities involving the intersection of joinder and the governmental immunity of the United States. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Mine Safety Appliances Co. v. Forrestal,</i> 326 U.S. 371, 373-375, 66 S.Ct. 219, 90 L.Ed. 140 (1945) (dismissing an action where the Under Secretary of the Navy was sued in his official capacity, because the Government was a required entity that could not be joined when it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2191</span> withheld consent to be sued); <i>Minnesota v. United States,</i> 305 U.S. 382, 386-388, 59 S.Ct. 292, 83 L.Ed. 235 (1939) (dismissing the action for nonjoinder of a required entity where the United States was the owner of the land in question but had not consented to suit). The analysis of the joinder issue in those cases was somewhat perfunctory, but the holdings were clear: A case may not proceed when a required-entity sovereign is not amenable to suit. These cases instruct us that where sovereign immunity is asserted, and the claims of the sovereign are not frivolous, dismissal of the action must be ordered where there is a potential for injury to the interests of the absent sovereign.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals accordingly erred in undertaking to rule on the merits of the Republic and the Commission's claims. There may be cases where the person who is not joined asserts a claim that is frivolous. In that instance a court may have leeway under both Rule 19(a)(1), defining required parties, and Rule 19(b), addressing when a suit may go forward nonetheless, to disregard the frivolous claim. Here, the claims of the absent entities are not frivolous; and the Court of Appeals should not have proceeded on the premise that those claims would be determined against the sovereign entities that asserted immunity.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals determined that the claims of the Republic and the Commission as to the assets would not succeed because a suit would be time barred in New York. This is not necessarily so. If the Sandiganbayan rules that the Republic owns the assets or stock of Arelma because Marcos did not own them and the property was forfeited to the Republic under Philippine law, then New York misappropriation rules might not be the applicable law. For instance, the Republic and the Commission, standing in for Arelma based upon the Sandiganbayan's judgment, might not pursue a misappropriation of public property suit, as the Court of Appeals assumed they would. They might instead, or in the alternative, file suit for breach of contract against Merrill Lynch. They would argue the statute of limitations would start to run if and when Merrill Lynch refused to hand over the assets. See N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7 213 (West Supp.2008); <i>Ely-Cruikshank Co. v. Bank of Montreal,</i> 81 N.Y.2d 399, 402, 599 N.Y.S.2d 501, 615 N.E.2d 985, 986 (1993) (\"In New York, a breach of contract cause of action accrues at the time of the breach\"). Or the Republic and the Commission might bring an action either in state or federal court to enforce the Sandiganbayan's judgment. See 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 482, Comment <i>a</i> (1986) (jurisdiction of foreign court rendering judgment is presumed); <i>id.,</i> at Comment <i>d</i> (providing exceptions not relevant here); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2467(c) (providing for enforcement of foreign forfeiture judgments in certain circumstances). Merrill Lynch makes arguments why these actions would not succeed, see Brief for Merrill Lynch as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 26-27, to which the Republic, the Commission, and the United States respond, see Reply Brief for Petitioners 14-18; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 24-28. We need not seek to predict the outcomes. It suffices that the claims would not be frivolous.</p>\n<p>As these comments indicate, Rule 19 cannot be applied in a vacuum, and it may require some preliminary assessment of the merits of certain claims. For example, the Rule directs a court, in determining who is a required person, to consider whether complete relief can be afforded in their absence. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)(1)(A). Likewise, in the Rule 19(b) inquiry, a court must examine, to some extent, the claims presented and the interests <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2192</span> likely to be asserted both by the joined parties and the absent entities or persons. Here, however, it was improper to issue a definitive holding regarding a nonfrivolous, substantive claim made by an absent, required entity that was entitled by its sovereign status to immunity from suit. That privilege is much diminished if an important and consequential ruling affecting the sovereign's substantial interest is determined, or at least assumed, by a federal court in the sovereign's absence and over its objection.</p>\n<p>As explained above, the decision to proceed in the absence of the Republic and the Commission ignored the substantial prejudice those entities likely would incur. This most directly implicates Rule 19(b)'s first factor, which directs consideration of prejudice both to absent persons and those who are parties. We have discussed the absent entities. As to existing parties, we do not discount the Pimentel class' interest in recovering damages it was awarded pursuant to a judgment. Furthermore, combating public corruption is a significant international policy. The policy is manifested in treaties providing for international cooperation in recovering forfeited assets. See, <i>e.g.,</i> United Nations Convention Against Corruption, G. &amp; A. Res. 5814, chs. IV and V, U.N. Doc. A/RES/58/4, pp. 22, 32 (Dec. 11, 2003) (reprinted in 43 I.L.M. 37 (2004)); Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Art. 16, Nov. 13, 1994, S. Treaty Doc. No. 104-18 (1995). This policy does support the interest of the Pimentel class in recovering damages awarded to it. But it also underscores the important comity concerns implicated by the Republic and the Commission in asserting foreign sovereign immunity. The error is not that the District Court and the Court of Appeals gave too much weight to the interest of the Pimentel class, but that it did not accord proper weight to the compelling claim of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p>Based on these considerations we conclude the District Court and the Court of Appeals gave insufficient weight to the likely prejudice to the Republic and the Commission should the interpleader proceed in their absence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>As to the second Rule 19(b) factor\u0097the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by relief or measures alternative to dismissal, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(b)(2)\u0097there is no substantial argument to allow the action to proceed. No alternative remedies or forms of relief have been proposed to us or appear to be available. See 7 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1608, pp. 106-110 (3d ed.2001) (collecting cases using alternative forms of relief, including the granting of money damages rather than specific performance, the use of declaratory judgment, and the direction that payment be withheld pending suits against the absent party). If the Marcos estate did not own the assets, or if the Republic owns them now, the claim of the Pimentel class likely fails; and in all events, if there are equally valid but competing claims, that too would require adjudication in a case where the Republic and the Commission are parties. See <i>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Tashire,</i> 386 U.S. 523, 534, and n. 16, 87 S.Ct. 1199, 18 L.Ed.2d 270 (1967); <i>Russell v. Clark's Executors,</i> 7 Cranch 69, 98-99, 3 L.Ed. 271 (1812) (Marshall, C. J.); <i>Wichita &amp; Affiliated Tribes of Okla. v. Hodel,</i> 788 F.2d 765, 774 (C.A.D.C.1986) (\"Conflicting claims by beneficiaries to a common trust present a textbook example of a case where one party may be severely prejudiced by a decision in his absence\" (citing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2193</span> <i>Williams v. Bankhead,</i> 19 Wall. 563, 570-571, 22 L.Ed. 184 (1874))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>As to the third Rule 19(b) factor\u0097 whether a judgment rendered without the absent party would be adequate, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(b)(3)\u0097the Court of Appeals understood \"adequacy\" to refer to satisfaction of the Pimentel class' claims. But adequacy refers to the \"public stake in settling disputes by wholes, whenever possible.\" <i>Provident Bank,</i> 390 U.S., at 111, 88 S.Ct. 733. This \"social interest in the efficient administration of justice and the avoidance of multiple litigation\" is an interest that has \"traditionally been thought to support compulsory joinder of absent and potentially adverse claimants.\" <i>Illinois Brick Co.,</i> 431 U.S., at 737-738, 97 S.Ct. 2061. Going forward with the action without the Republic and the Commission would not further the public interest in settling the dispute as a whole because the Republic and the Commission would not be bound by the judgment in an action where they were not parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>As to the fourth Rule 19(b) factor\u0097 whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(b)(4)\u0097the Court of Appeals made much of what it considered the tort victims' lack of an alternative forum should this action be dismissed. This seems to assume the plaintiff in this interpleader action was the Pimentel class. It is Merrill Lynch, however, that has the statutory status of plaintiff as the stakeholder in the interpleader action.</p>\n<p>It is true that, in an interpleader action, the stakeholder is often neutral as to the outcome, while other parties press claims in the manner of a plaintiff. That is insufficient, though, to overcome the statement in the interpleader statute that the stakeholder is the plaintiff. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1335(a) (conditioning jurisdiction in part upon whether \"the plaintiff has deposited such money or property\" at issue with the district court or has \"given bond payable to the clerk of the court in such amount and with such surety as the court or judge may deem proper\"). We do not ignore that, in context, the Pimentel class (and indeed all interpleader claimants) are to some extent comparable to the plaintiffs in noninterpleader cases. Their interests are not irrelevant to the Rule 19(b) equitable balance; but the other provisions of the Rule are the relevant ones to consult.</p>\n<p>Merrill Lynch, as the stakeholder, makes the point that if the action is dismissed it loses the benefit of a judgment allowing it to disburse the assets and be done with the matter. Dismissal of the action, it urges, leaves it without an adequate remedy, for it \"could potentially be forced . . . to defend lawsuits by the various claimants in different jurisdictions, possibly leading to inconsistent judgments.\" Brief for Merrill Lynch as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 14. A dismissal of the action on the ground of nonjoinder, however, will protect Merrill Lynch in some respects. That disposition will not provide Merrill Lynch with a judgment determining the party entitled to the assets, but it likely would provide Merrill Lynch with an effective defense against piecemeal litigation and inconsistent, conflicting judgments. As matters presently stand, in any later suit against it Merrill Lynch may seek to join the Republic and the Commission and have the action dismissed under Rule 19(b) should they again assert sovereign immunity. Dismissal for nonjoinder to some extent will serve the purpose of interpleader, which is to prevent a stakeholder from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2194</span> having to pay two or more parties for one claim.</p>\n<p>Any prejudice to Merrill Lynch in this regard is outweighed by prejudice to the absent entities invoking sovereign immunity. Dismissal under Rule 19(b) will mean, in some instances, that plaintiffs will be left without a forum for definitive resolution of their claims. But that result is contemplated under the doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Verlinden,</i> 461 U.S., at 497, 103 S.Ct. 1962 (\"[I]f a court determines that none of the exceptions to sovereign immunity applies, the plaintiff will be barred from raising his claim in any court in the United States\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals' failure to give sufficient weight to the likely prejudice to the Republic and the Commission should the interpleader proceed in their absence would, in the usual course, warrant reversal and remand for further proceedings. In this case, however, that error and our further analysis under the additional provisions of Rule 19(b) lead us to conclude the action must be dismissed. This leaves the Pimentel class, which has waited for years now to be compensated for grievous wrongs, with no immediate way to recover on its judgment against Marcos. And it leaves Merrill Lynch, the stakeholder, without a judgment.</p>\n<p>The balance of equities may change in due course. One relevant change may occur if it appears that the Sandiganbayan cannot or will not issue its ruling within a reasonable period of time. Other changes could result when and if there is a ruling. If the Sandiganbayan rules that the Republic and the Commission have no right to the assets, their claims in some later interpleader suit would be less substantial than they are now. If the ruling is that the Republic and the Commission own the assets, then they may seek to enforce a judgment in our courts; or consent to become parties in an interpleader suit, where their claims could be considered; or file in some other forum if they can obtain jurisdiction over the relevant persons. We do note that if Merrill Lynch, or other parties, elect to commence further litigation in light of changed circumstances, it would not be necessary to file the new action in the District Court where this action arose, provided venue and jurisdictional requirements are satisfied elsewhere. The present action, however, may not proceed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to order the District Court to dismiss the inter-pleader action.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals issued its decision before the 2007 Amendments to Rule 19(b) became effective. See <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith v. ENC Corp.,</i> 464 F.3d 885, 891 (C.A.9 2006). The text of the Rule before those changes were adopted is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Rule 19. Joinder of Persons Needed for Just Adjudication</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(a) Persons to be Joined if Feasible. A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2195</span> of the action in the person's absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest. If the person has not been so joined, the court shall order that the person be made a party. If the person should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, the person may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff. If the joined party objects to venue and joinder of that party would render the venue of the action improper, that party shall be dismissed from the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) Determination by Court Whenever Joinder not Feasible. If a person as described in subdivision (a)(1)-(2) hereof cannot be made a party, the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable. The factors to be considered by the court include: first, to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(c) Pleading Reasons for Nonjoinder. A pleading asserting a claim for relief shall state the names, if known to the pleader, of any persons as prescribed in subdivision (a)(1)-(2) hereof who are not joined, and the reasons why they are not joined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(d) Exception of Class Actions. This rule is subject to the provisions of Rule 23.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>While I join Part II of the Court's opinion holding that we have jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals' decision and agree that we should not affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment on the merits of its analysis under Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, I believe the appropriate disposition of this case is to reverse and remand for further proceedings. The District Court and the Ninth Circuit erred by concluding that the New York statute of limitations provides a virtually insuperable obstacle to petitioners' recovery of the Arelma, S. A., assets, and I therefore agree that this Court should reverse. I would not, however, give near-dispositive effect to the Republic of the Philippines (Republic) and the Philippine Presidential Commission on Good Governance's (Commission) status as sovereign entities, as the Court does in ordering outright dismissal of the case.</p>\n<p>In my judgment, the Court of Appeals should either order the District Judge to stay further proceedings pending a reasonably prompt decision of the Sandiganbayan or order the case reassigned to a different District Judge to conduct further proceedings. There is, of course, a risk of unfairness in conducting such proceedings without the participation of petitioners. But it is a risk that they can avoid by waiving their sovereign immunity, and the record provides a basis for believing that they would do so if the case proceeded before a different judge.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2196</span> The Republic did not invoke its sovereign immunity until after the District Court denied its motion seeking dismissal or transfer for improper venue, dismissal on act of state grounds, or recusal of the District Judge. App. 9; <i>id.,</i> at 2-3 (docket entries). In support of that motion they advanced a factual basis for suspecting that the District Judge's impartiality could be questioned. Memorandum of Law in Support of the Motions to Dismiss, Transfer or Stay, and For Recusal 23-28 in Civ. No. CV00-595MLR (D.Haw.). These facts demonstrate that the District Judge would likely \"have substantial difficulty in putting out of his or her mind previously-expressed views.\" <i>California v. Montrose Chemical Corp. of California,</i> 104 F.3d 1507, 1521 (C.A.9 1997) (providing the standard for when the Ninth Circuit will reassign a case; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>It appears, for example, that the District Judge summoned an attorney representing Merrill Lynch to a meeting in chambers in Los Angeles on September 11, 2000, after learning that the Republic and the Commission sought to obtain the Arelma funds from Merrill Lynch. During these proceedings, the District Judge directed Merrill Lynch to file an interpleader action before him in the District of Hawaii and to deposit the Arelma funds with the court, despite the attorney's argument that New York would likely be the more appropriate forum. See <i>ante,</i> at 2186-2187; Tr. 6 (Sept. 11, 2000). Merrill Lynch filed the interpleader on September 14, 2000, and the District Judge sealed the file, making it difficult for other parties to determine the status of the proceedings. See Affidavit of Richard A. Martin in Support of the Motions to Dismiss, Transfer, or Stay Submitted by the Republic of the Philippines and the Presidential Commission on Good Government in Civ. No. CV00-595MLR (D.Haw.), \u00b6 6-7, 11. These actions be-speak a level of personal involvement and desire to control the Marcos proceedings that create at least a colorable basis for the Republic and the Commission's concern about the District Judge's impartiality.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, following the Republic and the Commission's motion to dismiss the action on sovereign immunity grounds, the District Judge decided that they were not \"real parties in interest.\" See <i>In re Republic of Philippines,</i> 309 F.3d 1143, 1148 (C.A.9 2002). The Ninth Circuit reversed and directed the District Judge to enter a stay, <i>id.,</i> at 1153; the District Court did so, but vacated the stay within months. While the District Court's decision to do so was not without some basis, it presumably increased concern about the possibility that the District Judge would not fairly consider the Republic's position on the merits.</p>\n<p>Upon reassignment, the question whether to dismiss the case, to stay the proceedings, or to require the Republic to choose between asserting its sovereign immunity and defending on the merits would be open. The District Judge might wish to hold a hearing to determine whether the Republic and the Commission have a substantial argument that the Republic owned the disputed assets when they were conveyed to Arelma in 1972. While the Court assumes that the Republic's interest in the Arelma assets is \"not frivolous,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2191, on this record, it is not clear whether the Republic has a sufficient claim to those assets to preclude their recovery by judgment creditors of Marcos. The Republic's claim to disputed assets may be meritless for reasons unrelated to the potential statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>Further, in conducting the balancing inquiry mandated by Rule 19, as interpreted by Justice Harlan's opinion for the Court in <i>Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2197</span> <i>Co. v. Patterson,</i> 390 U.S. 102, 88 S.Ct. 733, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968), I would conclude that several facts specific to this case suggest that the Republic and the Commission's sovereign interests should be given less weight than in the ordinary case. First, in all events, the Republic and the Commission must take affirmative steps in United States courts (or possibly invoke the assistance of the Attorney General to do so, see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27) <i>at some point</i> in order to recover the assets held in the United States. Thus, the sovereign interest implicated here is not of the same magnitude as when a sovereign faces liability; the Republic's interest is in choosing the most convenient venue and time for the suit to proceed.</p>\n<p>Second, in the past two decades, the Republic has participated in other proceedings involving Marcos' assets in our courts without interposing any objection. Indeed, in 1987 it filed an <i>amicus</i> brief with the Ninth Circuit in the underlying consolidated class action that led to the entry of respondents' judgment against Marcos; in that brief the Republic urged the Ninth Circuit to reverse the District Judge's dismissal of two of the cases (later consolidated) under the act of state doctrine and \"to allow the Plaintiffs in those two cases to present their evidence of gross human rights violations against Ferdinand Marcos and to pursue justice in U.S. District Court.\" App. A to Brief for Respondent Pimentel RA-1.</p>\n<p>This was the Republic's position notwithstanding the fact that any recovery would come from a judgment against Marcos' assets\u0097assets that the Republic and the Commission now claim to have owned in full from the moment Marcos acquired them. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Republic in Nos. 04-16401, 04-16503, and 04-16538(CA9), p. 9 (\"Under Philippine law, assets resulting from the misuse of public office, bribery, corruption, and other such crimes by public officials are forfeit to the Republic from the moment such assets are generated\"); Pet. for Republic in No. 0141 (Sandiganbayon) (filed 1991) (seeking forfeiture of a large number of Marcos assets). Even if the Republic believed that Marcos might have some personal assets that were not ill gotten, under the Republic's theory that amount could not possibly have approached the judgment respondents received. Either the Republic was encouraging futile and purely symbolic litigation, or the Republic believed that other creditors would have access to at least a portion of Marcos' vast assets.</p>\n<p>In sum, I am persuaded that the Court's judgment today represents a more \"inflexible approach\" than the Rule contemplates. <i>Provident,</i> 390 U.S., at 107, 88 S.Ct. 733. All parties have an interest in the prompt resolution of the disposition of the Arelma assets. A remand would allow a new judge to handle the matter in an expeditious fashion rather than requiring a brand new proceeding. The Court suggests that Merrill Lynch may file in another District Court\u0097presumably in New York\u0097if it seeks to commence further litigation. See <i>ante,</i> at 2194. While this solution would put the matter before another District Judge, it requires the initiation of a new proceeding that may unnecessarily delay the final resolution.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I join all but Parts IV-B and V of the Court's opinion. I differ as to relief because a conclusion of the matter pending before the Sandiganbayan may simplify the issues raised in this case and render one disposition or another more clearly correct. I would therefore vacate the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2198</span> judgment and remand for a stay of proceedings for a reasonable time to await a decree of the Philippine court. If it should appear later that no such decree can be expected, the Court of Appeals could decide on the next step in light of the Court's opinion. For reasons given by Justice STEVENS, I would order that any further proceedings in the District Court be held before a judge fresh to the case.</p>\n</div>",

Argued March 17, 2008\u2014Decided June 12, 2008\nA class action by and for human rights victims (Pimentel class) of Fer-\n  dinand Marcos, while he was President of the Republic of the Philip-\n  pines (Republic), led to a nearly $2 billion judgment in a United\n  States District Court. The Pimentel class then sought to attach the\n  assets of Arelma, S. A. (Arelma), a company incorporated by Marcos,\n  held by a New York broker (Merrill Lynch). The Republic and a Phil-\n  ippine commission (Commission) established to recover property\n  wrongfully taken by Marcos are also attempting to recover this and\n  other Marcos property. The Philippine National Banc (PNB) holds\n  some of the disputed assets in escrow, awaiting the outcome of pend-\n  ing litigation in the Sandiganbayan, a Philippine court determining\n  whether Marcos\u2019 property should be forfeited to the Republic. Facing\n  claims from various Marcos creditors, including the Pimentel class,\n  Merrill Lynch filed this interpleader action under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71335,\n  naming, among the defendants, the Republic, the Commission,\n  Arelma, PNB (all petitioners here), and the Pimentel class (respon-\n  dents here). The Republic and the Commission asserted sovereign\n  immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, and\n  moved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(b),\n  arguing that the action could not proceed without them. Arelma and\n  PNB also sought a Rule 19(b) dismissal. The District Court refused,\n  but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the Republic and the\n  Commission are entitled to sovereign immunity and are required par-\n  ties under Rule 19(a), and it entered a stay pending the Sandiganba-\n  yan litigation\u2019s outcome. Finding that that litigation could not de-\n  termine entitlement to Arelma\u2019s assets, the District Court vacated\n2             REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v.

Because Arelma and PNB also seek review of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\n decision, this Court need not rule on the question whether the Repub-\n lic and the Commission, having been dismissed from the suit, had the\n right to seek review of the decision that the suit could proceed in\n their absence. As a general matter any party may move to dismiss\n an action under Rule 19(b). Arelma and PNB have not lost standing\n to have the judgment vacated in its entirety on procedural grounds\n simply because they did not appeal, or petition for certiorari on, the\n underlying merits ruling denying them the interpleaded assets.\n Pp. 7\u20139.\n    2. Rule 19 requires dismissal of the interpleader action. Pp. 9\u201320.\n       (a) Under Rule 19(a), nonjoinder even of a required person does\n not always result in dismissal. When joinder is not feasible, the\n question whether an action should proceed turns on nonexclusive\n considerations in Rule 19(b), which asks whether \u201cin equity and good\n conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or\n should be dismissed.\u201d The joinder issue can be complex, and the\n case-specific determinations involve multiple factors, some \u201csubstan-\n tive, some procedural, some compelling by themselves, and some sub-\n ject to balancing against opposing interests,\u201d Provident Tradesmens\n Bank & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U. S. 102, 119. Pp. 9\u201310.\n       (b) Here, Rule 19(a)\u2019s application is not contested: The Republic\n and the Commission are required entities. And this Court need not\n decide the proper standard of review for Rule 19(b) decisions, because\n the Ninth Circuit\u2019s errors of law require reversal. Pp. 10\u201319.\n         (1) The first factor directs the court to consider, in determining\n whether the action may proceed, the prejudice to absent entities and\n present parties in the event judgment is rendered without joinder.\n Rule 19(b)(1). The Ninth Circuit gave insufficient weight to the sov-\n ereign status of the Republic and the Commission in considering\n whether they would be prejudiced if the case proceeded. Giving full\n effect to sovereign immunity promotes the comity and dignity inter-\n                   Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nests that contributed to the development of the immunity doctrine.\nSee, e.g., Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480,\n486. These interests are concrete here. The entities\u2019 claims arise\nfrom historically and politically significant events for the Republic\nand its people, and the entities have a unique interest in resolving\nmatters related to Arelma\u2019s assets. A foreign state has a comity in-\nterest in using its courts for a dispute if it has a right to do so. Its\ndignity is not enhanced if other nations bypass its courts without\nright or good cause. A more specific affront could result if property\nthe Republic and the Commission claim is seized by a foreign court\ndecree. This Court has not considered the precise question pre-\nsented, but authorities involving the intersection of joinder and the\nUnited States\u2019 governmental immunity, see, e.g., Mine Safety Appli-\nances Co. v. Forrestal, 326 U. S. 371, 373\u2013375, instruct that where\nsovereign immunity is asserted, and the sovereign\u2019s claims are not\nfrivolous, dismissal must be ordered where there is a potential for in-\njury to the absent sovereign\u2019s interests. The claims of the Republic\nand the Commission were not frivolous, and the Ninth Circuit thus\nerred in ruling on their merits. The privilege of sovereign immunity\nfrom suit is much diminished if an important and consequential rul-\ning affecting the sovereign\u2019s substantial interest is determined, or at\nleast assumed, by a federal court in its absence and over its objection.\nThe Pimentel class\u2019 interest in recovering its damages is not dis-\ncounted, but important comity concerns are implicated by assertion of\nforeign sovereign immunity. The error is not that the courts below\ngave too much weight to the Pimentel class\u2019 interests, but that they\ndid not accord proper weight to the compelling sovereign immunity\nclaim. Pp. 11\u201316.\n       (2) The second factor is the extent to which any prejudice could\nbe lessened or avoided by relief or measures alternative to dismissal,\nRule 19(b)(2), but no alternative remedies or forms of relief have been\nproposed or appear to be available. As to the third factor\u2014whether a\njudgment rendered without the absent party would be adequate, Rule\n19(b)(3)\u2014\u201cadequacy\u201d refers not to satisfaction of the Pimentel class\u2019\nclaims, but to the \u201cpublic stake in settling disputes by wholes, when-\never possible,\u201d Provident Bank, supra, at 111. Going forward with\nthe action in the absence of the Republic and the Commission would\nnot further this public interest because they could not be bound by a\njudgment to which they were not parties. As to the fourth factor\u2014\nwhether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action\nwere dismissed for nonjoinder, Rule 19(b)(4)\u2014the Ninth Circuit made\nmuch of the tort victims\u2019 lack of an alternative forum. But Merrill\nLynch, not the Pimentel class, is the plaintiff as the stakeholder in\nthe interpleader action. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71335(a). The Pimentel\n4             REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v. PIMENTEL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    class\u2019 interests are not irrelevant to Rule 19(b)\u2019s equitable balance,\n    but the Rule\u2019s other provisions are the relevant ones to consult. A\n    dismissal on the ground of nonjoinder will not provide Merrill Lynch\n    with a judgment determining entitlement to the assets so it could be\n    done with the matter, but it likely would give Merrill Lynch an effec-\n    tive defense against piecemeal litigation by various claimants and in-\n    consistent, conflicting judgments. Any prejudice to Merrill Lynch is\n    outweighed by prejudice to the absent entities invoking sovereign\n    immunity. In the usual course, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s failure to give suf-\n    ficient weight to the likely prejudice to the Republic and the Commis-\n    sion would warrant reversal and remand for further determinations,\n    but here, that error plus this Court\u2019s analysis under Rule 19(b)\u2019s ad-\n    ditional provisions require the action\u2019s dismissal.

Two entities named in the suit invoked sov-\nereign immunity. They are the Republic of the Philippines\nand the Philippine Presidential Commission on Good\nGovernance, referred to in turn as the Republic and the\nCommission. They were dismissed, but the interpleader\naction proceeded to judgment over their objection. To-\ngether with two parties who remained in the suit, the\nRepublic and the Commission now insist it was error to\nallow the litigation to proceed. Under Rule 19, they con-\ntend, the action should have been dismissed once it be-\ncame clear they could not be joined as parties without\n2         REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v. PIMENTEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntheir consent.\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit, agreeing with the District Court, held the action\ncould proceed without the Republic and the Commission\nas parties. Among the reasons the Court of Appeals gave\nwas that the absent, sovereign entities would not prevail\non their claims. We conclude the Court of Appeals gave\ninsufficient weight to the foreign sovereign status of the\nRepublic and the Commission, and that the court further\nerred in reaching and discounting the merits of their\nclaims.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  When the opinion of the Court of Appeals is consulted,\nthe reader will find its quotations from Rule 19 do not\naccord with its text as set out here; for after the case was\nin the Court of Appeals and before it came here, the text of\nthe Rule changed. The Rules Committee advised the\nchanges were stylistic only, see Advisory Committee\u2019s\nNotes on 2007 Amendment to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19, 28\nU. S. C. A., p. 168 (2008); and we agree. These are the\nthree relevant stylistic changes. First, the word \u201crequired\u201d\nreplaced the word \u201cnecessary\u201d in subparagraph (a). Sec-\nond, the 1966 Rule set out factors in longer clauses and\nthe 2007 Rule sets out the factors affecting joinder in\nseparate lettered headings. Third, the word \u201cindispensa-\nble,\u201d which had remained as a remnant of the pre-1966\nRule, is altogether deleted from the current text. Though\nthe word \u201cindispensable\u201d had a lesser place in the 1966\nRule, it still had the latent potential to mislead.\n  As the substance and operation of the Rule both pre-\nand post-2007 are unchanged, we will refer to the present,\nrevised version. The pre-2007 version is printed in the\nAppendix of this opinion. The current Rule states, in\nrelevant part, as follows:\n             Cite as: 553 U.

A person who is subject to\nservice of process and whose joinder will not deprive\nthe court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined\nas a party if:\n\u201c(A) in that person\u2019s absence, the court cannot accord\ncomplete relief among existing parties; or\n\u201c(B) that person claims an interest relating to the\nsubject of the action and is so situated that disposing\nof the action in the person\u2019s absence may:\n\u201c(i) as a practical matter impair or impede the per-\nson\u2019s ability to protect the interest; or\n\u201c(ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial\nrisk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise incon-\nsistent obligations because of the interest.\n\u201c(2) Joinder by Court Order. If a person has not\nbeen joined as required, the court must order that the\nperson be made a party. A person who refuses to join\nas a plaintiff may be made either a defendant or, in a\nproper case, an involuntary plaintiff.\n\u201c(3) Venue. If a joined party objects to venue and the\njoinder would make venue improper, the court must\ndismiss that party.\n\u201c(b) When Joinder Is Not Feasible. If a person\nwho is required to be joined if feasible cannot be\njoined, the court must determine whether, in equity\nand good conscience, the action should proceed among\nthe existing parties or should be dismissed. The fac-\ntors for the court to consider include:\n\u201c(1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the\nperson\u2019s absence might prejudice that person or the\nexisting parties;\n\u201c(2) the extent to which any prejudice could be less-\nened or avoided by:\n4          REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v.

A. (Arelma), under Pana-\nmanian law. Around the same time, Arelma opened a\nbrokerage account with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &\nSmith Inc. (Merrill Lynch) in New York, in which it depos-\nited $2 million. As of the year 2000, the account had\ngrown to approximately $35 million.\n   Alleged crimes and misfeasance by Marcos during his\npresidency became the subject of worldwide attention and\nprotest. A class action by and on behalf of some 9,539 of\nhis human rights victims was filed against Marcos and his\nestate, among others. The class action was tried in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Hawaii and\nresulted in a nearly $2 billion judgment for the class. See\nHilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F. 3d 767 (CA9 1996). We\nrefer to that litigation as the Pimentel case and to its class\nmembers as the Pimentel class. In a related action, the\nEstate of Roger Roxas and Golden Budha [sic] Corporation\n(the Roxas claimants) claim a right to execute against the\nassets to satisfy their own judgment against Marcos\u2019\nwidow, Imelda Marcos. See Roxas v. Marcos, 89 Haw. 91,\n113\u2013115, 969 P. 2d 1209, 1231\u20131233 (1998).\n   The Pimentel class claims a right to enforce its judg-\nment by attaching the Arelma assets held by Merrill\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nLynch. The Republic and the Commission claim a right to\nthe assets under a 1955 Philippine law providing that\nproperty derived from the misuse of public office is for-\nfeited to the Republic from the moment of misappropria-\ntion. See An Act Declaring Forfeiture in Favor of the\nState Any Property Found To Have Been Unlawfully\nAcquired by Any Public Officer or Employee and Providing\nfor the Proceedings Therefor, Rep. Act No. 1379, 51:9 O. G.\n4457 (June 18, 1955).\n   After Marcos fled the Philippines in 1986, the Commis-\nsion was created to recover any property he wrongfully\ntook. Almost immediately the Commission asked the\nSwiss Government for assistance in recovering assets\u2014\nincluding shares in Arelma\u2014that Marcos had moved to\nSwitzerland. In compliance the Swiss Government froze\ncertain assets and, in 1990, that freeze was upheld by the\nSwiss Federal Supreme Court. In 1991, the Commission\nasked the Sandiganbayan, a Philippine court of special\njurisdiction over corruption cases, to declare forfeited to\nthe Republic any property Marcos had obtained through\nmisuse of his office. That litigation is still pending in the\nSandiganbayan.\n   The Swiss assets were transferred to an escrow account\nset up by the Commission at the Philippine National Banc\n(PNB), pending the Sandiganbayan\u2019s decision as to their\nrightful owner. The Republic and the Commission re-\nquested that Merrill Lynch follow the same course and\ntransfer the Arelma assets to an escrow account at PNB.\nMerrill Lynch did not do so. Facing claims from various\nMarcos creditors, including the Pimentel class, Merrill\nLynch instead filed an interpleader action under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71335. The named defendants in the interpleader\naction were, among others, the Republic and the Commis-\nsion, Arelma, PNB, and the Pimentel class (the respon-\ndents here).\n   The Pimentel case had been tried as a class action be-\n6         REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v. PIMENTEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfore Judge Manuel Real of the United States District\nCourt for the Central District of California, who was sit-\nting by designation in the District of Hawaii after the\nJudicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the\nvarious human rights complaints against Marcos in that\ncourt. See Hilao, supra, at 771. Judge Real directed\nMerrill Lynch to file the interpleader action in the District\nof Hawaii, and he presided over the matter.\n   After being named as defendants in the interpleader\naction, the Republic and the Commission asserted sover-\neign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a71604. They moved to\ndismiss pursuant to Rule 19(b), based on the premise that\nthe action could not proceed without them. Arelma and\nPNB also moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule 19(b). With-\nout addressing whether they were entitled to sovereign\nimmunity, Judge Real initially rejected the request by the\nRepublic and the Commission to dismiss the interpleader\naction. They appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed.\nIt held the Republic and the Commission are entitled to\nsovereign immunity and that under Rule 19(a) they are\nrequired parties (or \u201cnecessary\u201d parties under the old\nterminology). See In re Republic of the Philippines, 309\nF. 3d 1143, 1149\u20131152 (CA9 2002). The Court of Appeals\nentered a stay pending the outcome of the litigation in the\nSandiganbayan over the Marcos assets. See id., at 1152\u2013\n1153.\n   After concluding that the pending litigation in the\nSandiganbayan could not determine entitlement to the\nArelma assets, Judge Real vacated the stay, allowed the\naction to proceed, and awarded the assets to the Pimentel\nclass. A week later, in the case initiated before the Sandi-\nganbayan in 1991, the Republic asked that court to de-\nclare the Arelma assets forfeited, arguing the matter was\nripe for decision. The Sandiganbayan has not yet ruled.\n   In the interpleader case the Republic, the Commission,\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nArelma, and PNB appealed the District Court\u2019s judgment\nin favor of the Pimentel claimants. This time the Court of\nAppeals affirmed. See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &\nSmith v. ENC Corp., 464 F. 3d 885 (CA9 2006). Dismissal\nof the interpleader suit, it held, was not warranted under\nRule 19(b) because, though the Republic and the Commis-\nsion were required (\u201cnecessary\u201d) parties under Rule 19(a),\ntheir claim had so little likelihood of success on the merits\nthat the interpleader action could proceed without them.\nOne of the reasons the court gave was that any action\ncommenced by the Republic and the Commission to re-\ncover the assets would be barred by New York\u2019s 6-year\nstatute of limitations for claims involving the misappro-\npriation of public property. See N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann.\n\u00a7213 (West Supp. 2008). The court thus found it unneces-\nsary to consider whether any prejudice to the Republic and\nthe Commission might be lessened by some form of judg-\nment or interim decree in the interpleader action. The\ncourt also considered the failure of the Republic and the\nCommission to obtain a judgment in the Sandiganbayan\u2014\ndespite the Arelma share certificates having been located\nand held in escrow at the PNB since 1997\u20131998\u2014to be an\nequitable consideration counseling against dismissal of the\ninterpleader suit. The court further found it relevant that\nallowing the interpleader case to proceed would serve the\ninterests of the Pimentel class, which, at this point, likely\nhas no other available forum in which to enforce its judg-\nment against property belonging to Marcos.\n  This Court granted certiorari. See 552 U. S. ___ (2007).\n                           II\n  We begin with the question we asked the parties to\naddress when we granted certiorari: Whether the Republic\nand the Commission, having been dismissed from the\ninterpleader action based on their successful assertion of\nsovereign immunity, had the right to appeal the District\n8         REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v. PIMENTEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt\u2019s determination under Rule 19 that the action could\nproceed in their absence; and whether they have the right\nto seek this Court\u2019s review of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judg-\nment affirming the District Court. See ibid.\n   Respondents contend that the Republic and the Com-\nmission were not proper parties in the Court of Appeals\nwhen it reviewed the District Court\u2019s judgment allowing\nthe action to proceed without them; and, respondents\ncontinue, the Republic and the Commission are not proper\nparties in the instant proceeding before us. See Brief for\nRespondent Pimentel 21.\n   Without implying that respondents are correct in saying\nthe Republic and the Commission could neither appeal nor\nbecome parties here, we conclude we need not rule on this\npoint. Other parties before us, Arelma and PNB, also seek\nreview of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision affirming the\nDistrict Court. They, too, moved to dismiss the action\nunder Rule 19(b), appealed from the denial of their mo-\ntion, and are petitioners before this Court. As a general\nmatter any party may move to dismiss an action under\nRule 19(b). A court with proper jurisdiction may also\nconsider sua sponte the absence of a required person and\ndismiss for failure to join. See, e.g., Minnesota v. Northern\nSecurities Co., 184 U. S. 199, 235 (1902); see also Provi-\ndent Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U. S.\n102, 111 (1968).\n   Respondents argue, however, that Arelma and PNB\nhave no standing to raise before this Court the question\nwhether the action may proceed in the absence of the\nRepublic and the Commission. Arelma and PNB lost on\nthe merits of their underlying claims to the interpleaded\nassets in both the District Court and the Court of Appeals.\nBy failing to petition for certiorari on that merits ruling,\nrespondents contend, Arelma and PNB abandoned any\nentitlement to the interpleaded assets and therefore lack a\nconcrete stake in the outcome of further proceedings. We\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndisagree. Dismissal of the action under Rule 19(b) would\nbenefit Arelma and PNB by vacating the judgment deny-\ning them the interpleaded assets. A party that seeks to\nhave a judgment vacated in its entirety on procedural\ngrounds does not lose standing simply because the party\ndoes not petition for certiorari on the substance of the\norder.\n                             III\n  We turn to the question whether the interpleader action\ncould proceed in the District Court without the Republic\nand the Commission as parties.\n  Subdivision (a) of Rule 19 states the principles that\ndetermine when persons or entities must be joined in a\nsuit. The Rule instructs that nonjoinder even of a re-\nquired person does not always result in dismissal. Subdi-\nvision (a) opens by noting that it addresses joinder \u201cif\nFeasible.\u201d Where joinder is not feasible, the question\nwhether the action should proceed turns on the factors\noutlined in subdivision (b). The considerations set forth in\nsubdivision (b) are nonexclusive, as made clear by the\nintroductory statement that \u201c[t]he factors for the court to\nconsider include.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(b). The general\ndirection is whether \u201cin equity and good conscience, the\naction should proceed among the existing parties or should\nbe dismissed.\u201d Ibid. The design of the Rule, then, indi-\ncates that the determination whether to proceed will turn\nupon factors that are case specific, which is consistent\nwith a Rule based on equitable considerations. This is\nalso consistent with the fact that the determination of who\nmay, or must, be parties to a suit has consequences for the\npersons and entities affected by the judgment; for the\njudicial system and its interest in the integrity of its proc-\nesses and the respect accorded to its decrees; and for\nsociety and its concern for the fair and prompt resolution\nof disputes. See, e.g., Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431\n10        REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v. PIMENTEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 720, 737\u2013739 (1977). For these reasons, the issue of\njoinder can be complex, and determinations are case spe-\ncific. See, e.g., Provident Bank, supra, at 118\u2013119.\n   Under the earlier Rules the term \u201cindispensable party\u201d\nmight have implied a certain rigidity that would be in\ntension with this case-specific approach. The word \u201cindis-\npensable\u201d had an unforgiving connotation that did not fit\neasily with a system that permits actions to proceed even\nwhen some persons who otherwise should be parties to the\naction cannot be joined. As the Court noted in Provident\nBank, the use of \u201cindispensable\u201d in Rule 19 created the\n\u201cverbal anomaly\u201d of an \u201cindispensable person who turns\nout to be dispensable after all.\u201d 390 U. S., at 117, n. 12.\nThough the text has changed, the new Rule 19 has the\nsame design and, to some extent, the same tension. Re-\nquired persons may turn out not to be required for the\naction to proceed after all.\n   In all events it is clear that multiple factors must bear\non the decision whether to proceed without a required\nperson. This decision \u201cmust be based on factors varying\nwith the different cases, some such factors being substan-\ntive, some procedural, some compelling by themselves, and\nsome subject to balancing against opposing interests.\u201d Id.,\nat 119.\n                             IV\n  We turn to Rule 19 as it relates to this case. The appli-\ncation of subdivision (a) of Rule 19 is not contested. The\nRepublic and the Commission are required entities be-\ncause \u201c[w]ithout [them] as parties in this interpleader\naction, their interests in the subject matter are not pro-\ntected.\u201d In re Republic of Philippines, 309 F. 3d, at 1152;\nsee Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)(1)(B)(i). All parties appear\nto concede this. The disagreement instead centers around\nthe application of subdivision (b), which addresses\nwhether the action may proceed without the Republic and\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Commission, given that the Rule requires them to be\nparties.\n   We have not addressed the standard of review for Rule\n19(b) decisions. The case-specific inquiry that must be\nfollowed in applying the standards set forth in subdivision\n(b), including the direction to consider whether \u201cin equity\nand good conscience\u201d the case should proceed, implies\nsome degree of deference to the district court. In this case,\nhowever, we find implicit in the District Court\u2019s rulings,\nand explicit in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, errors\nof law that require reversal. Whatever the appropriate\nstandard of review, a point we need not decide, the judg-\nment could not stand. Cf. Koon v. United States, 518 U. S.\n81, 99\u2013100 (1996) (a court \u201cby definition abuses its discre-\ntion when it makes an error of law\u201d).\n   The Court of Appeals erred in not giving the necessary\nweight to the absent entities\u2019 assertion of sovereign im-\nmunity. The court in effect decided the merits of the\nRepublic and the Commission\u2019s claims to the Arelma\nassets. Once it was recognized that those claims were not\nfrivolous, it was error for the Court of Appeals to address\nthem on their merits when the required entities had been\ngranted sovereign immunity. The court\u2019s consideration of\nthe merits was itself an infringement on foreign sovereign\nimmunity; and, in any event, its analysis was flawed. We\ndiscuss these errors first in the context of how they af-\nfected the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis under the first factor\nof Rule 19(b). We then explain that the outcome suggested\nby the first factor is confirmed by our analysis under the\nother provisions of Rule 19(b). The action may not\nproceed.\n                             A\n  As to the first Rule 19(b) factor\u2014the extent to which a\njudgment rendered in the person\u2019s absence might preju-\ndice that person or the existing parties, Fed. Rule Civ.\n12        REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v. PIMENTEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nProc. 19(b)(1)\u2014the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nincorrect.\n   In considering whether the Republic and the Commis-\nsion would be prejudiced if the action were to proceed in\ntheir absence, the Court of Appeals gave insufficient\nweight to their sovereign status. The doctrine of foreign\nsovereign immunity has been recognized since early in the\nhistory of our Nation. It is premised upon the \u201cperfect\nequality and absolute independence of sovereigns, and\nth[e] common interest impelling them to mutual inter-\ncourse.\u201d Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116,\n137 (1812). The Court has observed that the doctrine is\ndesigned to \u201cgive foreign states and their instrumentali-\nties some protection from the inconvenience of suit,\u201d Dole\nFood Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U. S. 468, 479 (2003).\n   The privilege is codified by federal statute. FSIA, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71330, 1602\u20131611, provides that \u201ca foreign state\nshall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the\nUnited States and of the States except as provided in\nsections 1605 to 1607,\u201d absent existing international\nagreements to the contrary. \u00a71604; see Verlinden B. V. v.\nCentral Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 486\u2013489 (1983)\n(explaining the history of the doctrine\u2019s codification).\nExceptions to the general principle of foreign sovereign\nimmunity are contained in \u00a7\u00a71605\u20131607 of the statute.\nThey are inapplicable here, or at least the parties do not\ninvoke them. Immunity in this case, then, is uncontested;\nand pursuant to the Court of Appeals\u2019 earlier ruling on the\nissue, the District Court dismissed the Republic and the\nCommission from the action on this ground.\n   The District Court and the Court of Appeals failed to\ngive full effect to sovereign immunity when they held the\naction could proceed without the Republic and the Com-\nmission. Giving full effect to sovereign immunity pro-\nmotes the comity interests that have contributed to the\ndevelopment of the immunity doctrine. See, e.g., id., at\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n486 (\u201c[F]oreign sovereign immunity is a matter of grace\nand comity\u201d); National City Bank of N. Y. v. Republic of\nChina, 348 U. S. 356, 362, and n. 7 (1955) (foreign sover-\neign immunity derives from \u201cstandards of public morality,\nfair dealing, reciprocal self-interest, and respect for the\n\u2018power and dignity\u2019 of the foreign sovereign\u201d (quoting\nSchooner Exchange, supra, at 136\u2013137, 143\u2013144)).\n   Comity and dignity interests take concrete form in this\ncase. The claims of the Republic and the Commission\narise from events of historical and political significance for\nthe Republic and its people. The Republic and the Com-\nmission have a unique interest in resolving the ownership\nof or claims to the Arelma assets and in determining if,\nand how, the assets should be used to compensate those\npersons who suffered grievous injury under Marcos.\nThere is a comity interest in allowing a foreign state to use\nits own courts for a dispute if it has a right to do so. The\ndignity of a foreign state is not enhanced if other nations\nbypass its courts without right or good cause. Then, too,\nthere is the more specific affront that could result to the\nRepublic and the Commission if property they claim is\nseized by the decree of a foreign court. Cf. Republic of\nMexico v. Hoffman, 324 U. S. 30, 35\u201336 (1945) (pre-FSIA,\ncommon-law doctrine dictated that courts defer to execu-\ntive determination of immunity because \u201c[t]he judicial\nseizure\u201d of the property of a friendly state may be re-\ngarded as \u201can affront to its dignity and may . . . affect our\nrelations with it\u201d).\n   Though this Court has not considered a case posing the\nprecise question presented here, there are some authori-\nties involving the intersection of joinder and the govern-\nmental immunity of the United States. See, e.g., Mine\nSafety Appliances Co. v. Forrestal, 326 U. S. 371, 373\u2013375\n(1945) (dismissing an action where the Under Secretary of\nthe Navy was sued in his official capacity, because the\nGovernment was a required entity that could not be joined\n14        REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v. PIMENTEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen it withheld consent to be sued); Minnesota v. United\nStates, 305 U. S. 382, 386\u2013388 (1939) (dismissing the\naction for nonjoinder of a required entity where the United\nStates was the owner of the land in question but had not\nconsented to suit). The analysis of the joinder issue in\nthose cases was somewhat perfunctory, but the holdings\nwere clear: A case may not proceed when a required-entity\nsovereign is not amenable to suit. These cases instruct us\nthat where sovereign immunity is asserted, and the claims\nof the sovereign are not frivolous, dismissal of the action\nmust be ordered where there is a potential for injury to\nthe interests of the absent sovereign.\n   The Court of Appeals accordingly erred in undertaking\nto rule on the merits of the Republic and the Commission\u2019s\nclaims. There may be cases where the person who is not\njoined asserts a claim that is frivolous. In that instance a\ncourt may have leeway under both Rule 19(a)(1), defining\nrequired parties, and Rule 19(b), addressing when a suit\nmay go forward nonetheless, to disregard the frivolous\nclaim. Here, the claims of the absent entities are not\nfrivolous; and the Court of Appeals should not have\nproceeded on the premise that those claims would be\ndetermined against the sovereign entities that asserted\nimmunity.\n   The Court of Appeals determined that the claims of the\nRepublic and the Commission as to the assets would not\nsucceed because a suit would be time barred in New York.\nThis is not necessarily so. If the Sandiganbayan rules that\nthe Republic owns the assets or stock of Arelma because\nMarcos did not own them and the property was forfeited to\nthe Republic under Philippine law, then New York misap-\npropriation rules might not be the applicable law. For\ninstance, the Republic and the Commission, standing in\nfor Arelma based upon the Sandiganbayan\u2019s judgment,\nmight not pursue a misappropriation of public property\nsuit, as the Court of Appeals assumed they would. They\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmight instead, or in the alternative, file suit for breach of\ncontract against Merrill Lynch. They would argue the\nstatute of limitations would start to run if and when\nMerrill Lynch refused to hand over the assets. See\nN. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7213 (West Supp. 2008); Ely-\nCruikshank Co. v. Bank of Montreal, 81 N. Y. 2d 399, 402,\n615 N. E. 2d 985, 986 (1993) (\u201cIn New York, a breach of\ncontract cause of action accrues at the time of the breach\u201d).\nOr the Republic and the Commission might bring an\naction either in state or federal court to enforce the Sandi-\nganbayan\u2019s judgment. See 1 Restatement (Third) of For-\neign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7482, Comment a\n(1986) (jurisdiction of foreign court rendering judgment is\npresumed); id., at Comment d (providing exceptions not\nrelevant here); see also 28 U. S. C. \u00a72467(c) (providing for\nenforcement of foreign forfeiture judgments in certain\ncircumstances). Merrill Lynch makes arguments why\nthese actions would not succeed, see Brief for Merrill\nLynch as Amicus Curiae 26\u201327, to which the Republic, the\nCommission, and the United States respond, see Reply\nBrief for Petitioners 14\u201318; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 24\u201328. We need not seek to predict\nthe outcomes. It suffices that the claims would not be\nfrivolous.\n   As these comments indicate, Rule 19 cannot be applied\nin a vacuum, and it may require some preliminary as-\nsessment of the merits of certain claims. For example, the\nRule directs a court, in determining who is a required\nperson, to consider whether complete relief can be afforded\nin their absence. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)(1)(A).\nLikewise, in the Rule 19(b) inquiry, a court must examine,\nto some extent, the claims presented and the interests\nlikely to be asserted both by the joined parties and the\nabsent entities or persons. Here, however, it was im-\nproper to issue a definitive holding regarding a nonfrivo-\nlous, substantive claim made by an absent, required entity\n16        REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v. PIMENTEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat was entitled by its sovereign status to immunity from\nsuit. That privilege is much diminished if an important\nand consequential ruling affecting the sovereign\u2019s\nsubstantial interest is determined, or at least assumed, by\na federal court in the sovereign\u2019s absence and over its\nobjection.\n   As explained above, the decision to proceed in the ab-\nsence of the Republic and the Commission ignored the\nsubstantial prejudice those entities likely would incur.\nThis most directly implicates Rule 19(b)\u2019s first factor,\nwhich directs consideration of prejudice both to absent\npersons and those who are parties. We have discussed the\nabsent entities. As to existing parties, we do not discount\nthe Pimentel class\u2019 interest in recovering damages it was\nawarded pursuant to a judgment. Furthermore, combat-\ning public corruption is a significant international policy.\nThe policy is manifested in treaties providing for interna-\ntional cooperation in recovering forfeited assets. See, e.g.,\nUnited Nations Convention Against Corruption, G. A.\nRes. 5814, chs. IV and V, U. N. Doc. A/RES/58/4, pp. 22,\n32 (Dec. 11, 2003) (reprinted in 43 I. L. M. 37 (2004));\nTreaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters\nArt. 16, Nov. 13, 1994, S. Treaty Doc. No. 104\u201318 (1995).\nThis policy does support the interest of the Pimentel class\nin recovering damages awarded to it. But it also under-\nscores the important comity concerns implicated by the\nRepublic and the Commission in asserting foreign sover-\neign immunity. The error is not that the District Court\nand the Court of Appeals gave too much weight to the\ninterest of the Pimentel class, but that it did not ac-\ncord proper weight to the compelling claim of sovereign\nimmunity.\n   Based on these considerations we conclude the District\nCourt and the Court of Appeals gave insufficient weight to\nthe likely prejudice to the Republic and the Commission\nshould the interpleader proceed in their absence.\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             B\n  As to the second Rule 19(b) factor\u2014the extent to which\nany prejudice could be lessened or avoided by relief or\nmeasures alternative to dismissal, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n19(b)(2)\u2014there is no substantial argument to allow the\naction to proceed. No alternative remedies or forms of\nrelief have been proposed to us or appear to be available.\nSee 7 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice\nand Procedure \u00a71608, pp. 106\u2013110 (3d ed. 2001) (collecting\ncases using alternative forms of relief, including the grant-\ning of money damages rather than specific performance,\nthe use of declaratory judgment, and the direction that\npayment be withheld pending suits against the absent\nparty). If the Marcos estate did not own the assets, or if\nthe Republic owns them now, the claim of the Pimentel\nclass likely fails; and in all events, if there are equally\nvalid but competing claims, that too would require adjudi-\ncation in a case where the Republic and the Commission\nare parties. See State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v.\nTashire, 386 U. S. 523, 534, and n. 16 (1967); Russell v.\nClark\u2019s Executors, 7 Cranch 69, 98\u201399 (1812) (Marshall,\nC.

Going forward with the action without the\nRepublic and the Commission would not further the public\ninterest in settling the dispute as a whole because the\nRepublic and the Commission would not be bound by the\njudgment in an action where they were not parties.\n                               D\n  As to the fourth Rule 19(b) factor\u2014whether the plaintiff\nwould have an adequate remedy if the action were dis-\nmissed for nonjoinder, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(b)(4)\u2014the\nCourt of Appeals made much of what it considered the tort\nvictims\u2019 lack of an alternative forum should this action be\ndismissed. This seems to assume the plaintiff in this\ninterpleader action was the Pimentel class. It is Merrill\nLynch, however, that has the statutory status of plaintiff\nas the stakeholder in the interpleader action.\n  It is true that, in an interpleader action, the stakeholder\nis often neutral as to the outcome, while other parties\npress claims in the manner of a plaintiff. That is insuffi-\ncient, though, to overcome the statement in the inter-\npleader statute that the stakeholder is the plaintiff. See\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71335(a) (conditioning jurisdiction in part upon\nwhether \u201cthe plaintiff has deposited such money or prop-\nerty\u201d at issue with the district court or has \u201cgiven bond\npayable to the clerk of the court in such amount and with\nsuch surety as the court or judge may deem proper\u201d). We\ndo not ignore that, in context, the Pimentel class (and\nindeed all interpleader claimants) are to some extent\ncomparable to the plaintiffs in noninterpleader cases.\nTheir interests are not irrelevant to the Rule 19(b) equita-\nble balance; but the other provisions of the Rule are the\nrelevant ones to consult.\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Merrill Lynch, as the stakeholder, makes the point that\nif the action is dismissed it loses the benefit of a judgment\nallowing it to disburse the assets and be done with the\nmatter. Dismissal of the action, it urges, leaves it without\nan adequate remedy, for it \u201ccould potentially be forced . . .\nto defend lawsuits by the various claimants in different\njurisdictions, possibly leading to inconsistent judgments.\u201d\nBrief for Merrill Lynch as Amicus Curiae 14. A dismissal\nof the action on the ground of nonjoinder, however, will\nprotect Merrill Lynch in some respects. That disposition\nwill not provide Merrill Lynch with a judgment determin-\ning the party entitled to the assets, but it likely would\nprovide Merrill Lynch with an effective defense against\npiecemeal litigation and inconsistent, conflicting judg-\nments. As matters presently stand, in any later suit\nagainst it Merrill Lynch may seek to join the Republic and\nthe Commission and have the action dismissed under Rule\n19(b) should they again assert sovereign immunity. Dis-\nmissal for nonjoinder to some extent will serve the pur-\npose of interpleader, which is to prevent a stakeholder\nfrom having to pay two or more parties for one claim.\n   Any prejudice to Merrill Lynch in this regard is out-\nweighed by prejudice to the absent entities invoking sov-\nereign immunity. Dismissal under Rule 19(b) will mean,\nin some instances, that plaintiffs will be left without a\nforum for definitive resolution of their claims. But that\nresult is contemplated under the doctrine of foreign sover-\neign immunity. See, e.g., Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 497 (\u201c[I]f\na court determines that none of the exceptions to sover-\neign immunity applies, the plaintiff will be barred from\nraising his claim in any court in the United States\u201d).\n                            V\n  The Court of Appeals\u2019 failure to give sufficient weight to\nthe likely prejudice to the Republic and the Commission\nshould the interpleader proceed in their absence would, in\n20        REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v. PIMENTEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe usual course, warrant reversal and remand for further\nproceedings. In this case, however, that error and our\nfurther analysis under the additional provisions of Rule\n19(b) lead us to conclude the action must be dismissed.\nThis leaves the Pimentel class, which has waited for years\nnow to be compensated for grievous wrongs, with no im-\nmediate way to recover on its judgment against Marcos.\nAnd it leaves Merrill Lynch, the stakeholder, without a\njudgment.\n   The balance of equities may change in due course. One\nrelevant change may occur if it appears that the Sandi-\nganbayan cannot or will not issue its ruling within a\nreasonable period of time. Other changes could result\nwhen and if there is a ruling. If the Sandiganbayan rules\nthat the Republic and the Commission have no right to the\nassets, their claims in some later interpleader suit would\nbe less substantial than they are now. If the ruling is that\nthe Republic and the Commission own the assets, then\nthey may seek to enforce a judgment in our courts; or\nconsent to become parties in an interpleader suit, where\ntheir claims could be considered; or file in some other\nforum if they can obtain jurisdiction over the relevant\npersons. We do note that if Merrill Lynch, or other par-\nties, elect to commence further litigation in light of\nchanged circumstances, it would not be necessary to file\nthe new action in the District Court where this action\narose, provided venue and jurisdictional requirements are\nsatisfied elsewhere.

A., as\u00ad\nsets, and I therefore agree that this Court should reverse.\nI would not, however, give near-dispositive effect to the\nRepublic of the Philippines (Republic) and the Philippine\nPresidential Commission on Good Governance\u2019s (Commis\u00ad\nsion) status as sovereign entities, as the Court does in\nordering outright dismissal of the case.\n  In my judgment, the Court of Appeals should either\norder the District Judge to stay further proceedings pend\u00ad\ning a reasonably prompt decision of the Sandiganbayan or\norder the case reassigned to a different District Judge to\nconduct further proceedings. There is, of course, a risk of\n2         REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v. PIMENTEL\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nunfairness in conducting such proceedings without the\nparticipation of petitioners. But it is a risk that they can\navoid by waiving their sovereign immunity, and the record\nprovides a basis for believing that they would do so if the\ncase proceeded before a different judge.\n   The Republic did not invoke its sovereign immunity\nuntil after the District Court denied its motion seeking\ndismissal or transfer for improper venue, dismissal on act\nof state grounds, or recusal of the District Judge. App. 9;\nid., at 2\u20133 (docket entries). In support of that motion they\nadvanced a factual basis for suspecting that the District\nJudge\u2019s impartiality could be questioned. Memorandum of\nLaw in Support of the Motions to Dismiss, Transfer or\nStay, and For Recusal 23\u201328 in Civ. No. CV00\u2013595MLR\n(D. Haw.). These facts demonstrate that the District\nJudge would likely \u201chave substantial difficulty in putting\nout of his or her mind previously-expressed views.\u201d Cali-\nfornia v. Montrose Chemical Corp. of California, 104 F. 3d\n1507, 1521 (CA9 1997) (providing the standard for when\nthe Ninth Circuit will reassign a case; internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   It appears, for example, that the District Judge sum\u00ad\nmoned an attorney representing Merrill Lynch to a meet\u00ad\ning in chambers in Los Angeles on September 11, 2000,\nafter learning that the Republic and the Commission\nsought to obtain the Arelma funds from Merrill Lynch.\nDuring these proceedings, the District Judge directed\nMerrill Lynch to file an interpleader action before him in\nthe District of Hawaii and to deposit the Arelma funds\nwith the court, despite the attorney\u2019s argument that New\nYork would likely be the more appropriate forum. See\nante, at 6; Tr. 6 (Sept. 11, 2000). Merrill Lynch filed the\ninterpleader on September 14, 2000, and the District\nJudge sealed the file, making it difficult for other parties\nto determine the status of the proceedings. See Affidavit\nof Richard A. Martin in Support of the Motions to Dismiss,\n                   Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)              3\n\n                      Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nTransfer, or Stay Submitted by the Republic of the Philip\u00ad\npines and the Presidential Commission on Good Govern\u00ad\nment in Civ. No. CV00\u2013595MLR (D. Haw.), \u00b66\u20137, 11.\nThese actions bespeak a level of personal involvement and\ndesire to control the Marcos proceedings that create at\nleast a colorable basis for the Republic and the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s concern about the District Judge\u2019s impartiality.\n  Furthermore, following the Republic and the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s motion to dismiss the action on sovereign immunity\ngrounds, the District Judge decided that they were not\n\u201creal parties in interest.\u201d See In re Republic of Philip-\npines, 309 F. 3d 1143, 1148 (CA9 2002). The Ninth Circuit\nreversed and directed the District Judge to enter a stay,\nid., at 1153; the District Court did so, but vacated the stay\nwithin months. While the District Court\u2019s decision to do\nso was not without some basis, it presumably increased\nconcern about the possibility that the District Judge would\nnot fairly consider the Republic\u2019s position on the merits.\n  Upon reassignment, the question whether to dismiss the\ncase, to stay the proceedings, or to require the Republic to\nchoose between asserting its sovereign immunity and\ndefending on the merits would be open. The District\nJudge might wish to hold a hearing to determine whether\nthe Republic and the Commission have a substantial\nargument that the Republic owned the disputed assets\nwhen they were conveyed to Arelma in 1972. While the\nCourt assumes that the Republic\u2019s interest in the Arelma\nassets is \u201cnot frivolous,\u201d ante, at 14, on this record, it is not\nclear whether the Republic has a sufficient claim to those\nassets to preclude their recovery by judgment creditors of\nMarcos. The Republic\u2019s claim to disputed assets may be\nmeritless for reasons unrelated to the potential statute of\nlimitations.\n  Further, in conducting the balancing inquiry mandated\nby Rule 19, as interpreted by Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion for\nthe Court in Provident Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v.\n4         REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES v. PIMENTEL\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nPatterson, 390 U. S. 102 (1968), I would conclude that\nseveral facts specific to this case suggest that the Republic\nand the Commission\u2019s sovereign interests should be given\nless weight than in the ordinary case. First, in all events,\nthe Republic and the Commission must take affirmative\nsteps in United States courts (or possibly invoke the assis\u00ad\ntance of the Attorney General to do so, see Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 27) at some point in order to\nrecover the assets held in the United States. Thus, the\nsovereign interest implicated here is not of the same mag\u00ad\nnitude as when a sovereign faces liability; the Republic\u2019s\ninterest is in choosing the most convenient venue and time\nfor the suit to proceed.\n   Second, in the past two decades, the Republic has par\u00ad\nticipated in other proceedings involving Marcos\u2019 assets in\nour courts without interposing any objection. Indeed, in\n1987 it filed an amicus brief with the Ninth Circuit in the\nunderlying consolidated class action that led to the entry\nof respondents\u2019 judgment against Marcos; in that brief the\nRepublic urged the Ninth Circuit to reverse the District\nJudge\u2019s dismissal of two of the cases (later consolidated)\nunder the act of state doctrine and \u201cto allow the Plaintiffs\nin those two cases to present their evidence of gross hu\u00ad\nman rights violations against Ferdinand Marcos and to\npursue justice in U. S. District Court.\u201d App. A to Brief for\nRespondent Pimentel RA\u20131.\n   This was the Republic\u2019s position notwithstanding the\nfact that any recovery would come from a judgment\nagainst Marcos\u2019 assets\u2014assets that the Republic and the\nCommission now claim to have owned in full from the\nmoment Marcos acquired them. See, e.g., Brief for Repub\u00ad\nlic in Nos. 04\u201316401, 04\u201316503, and 04\u201316538 (CA9), p. 9\n(\u201cUnder Philippine law, assets resulting from the misuse\nof public office, bribery, corruption, and other such crimes\nby public officials are forfeit to the Republic from the\nmoment such assets are generated\u201d); Pet. for Republic in\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           5\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nNo. 0141 (Sandiganbayon) (filed 1991) (seeking forfeiture\nof a large number of Marcos assets). Even if the Republic\nbelieved that Marcos might have some personal assets\nthat were not ill gotten, under the Republic\u2019s theory that\namount could not possibly have approached the judgment\nrespondents received. Either the Republic was encourag\u00ad\ning futile and purely symbolic litigation, or the Republic\nbelieved that other creditors would have access to at least\na portion of Marcos\u2019 vast assets.\n   In sum, I am persuaded that the Court\u2019s judgment today\nrepresents a more \u201cinflexible approach\u201d than the Rule\ncontemplates. Provident, 390 U. S., at 107. All parties\nhave an interest in the prompt resolution of the disposi\u00ad\ntion of the Arelma assets. A remand would allow a new\njudge to handle the matter in an expeditious fashion\nrather than requiring a brand new proceeding. The Court\nsuggests that Merrill Lynch may file in another District\nCourt\u2014presumably in New York\u2014if it seeks to commence\nfurther litigation. See ante, at 20. While this solution\nwould put the matter before another District Judge, it\nrequires the initiation of a new proceeding that may un\u00ad\nnecessarily delay the final resolution.\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

Pimentel and the Class of Human Rights Victims.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case turns on the interpretation and proper application of Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and requires us to address the Rule's operation in the context of foreign sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p>This interpleader action was commenced to determine the ownership of property allegedly stolen by Ferdinand Marcos when he was the President of the Republic of the Philippines. Two entities named in the suit invoked sovereign immunity. They are the Republic of the Philippines and the Philippine Presidential Commission on Good Governance, referred to in turn as the Republic and the Commission. They were dismissed, but the interpleader action proceeded to judgment over their objection. Together with two parties who remained in the suit, the Republic and the Commission now insist it was error to allow the litigation to proceed. Under Rule 19, they contend, the action should have been dismissed once it became clear they could not be joined as parties without their consent.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, agreeing with the District Court, held the action could proceed without the Republic and the Commission as parties. Among the reasons the Court of Appeals gave was that the absent, sovereign entities would not prevail on their claims. We conclude the Court of Appeals gave insufficient weight to the foreign sovereign status of the Republic and the Commission, and that the court further erred in reaching and discounting the merits of their claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>When the opinion of the Court of Appeals is consulted, the reader will find its quotations from Rule 19 do not accord with its text as set out here; for after the case was in the Court of Appeals and before it came here, the text of the Rule changed. The Rules Committee advised the changes were stylistic only, see Advisory Committee's Notes on 2007 Amendment to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19, 28 U.S.C. A., p. 168 (2008); and we agree. These are the three relevant stylistic changes. First, the word \"required\" replaced the word \"necessary\" in subparagraph (a). Second, the 1966 Rule set out factors in longer clauses and the 2007 Rule sets out the factors affecting joinder in separate lettered headings. Third, the word \"indispensable,\" which had remained as a remnant of the pre-1966 Rule, is altogether deleted from the current text. Though the word \"indispensable\" had a lesser place in the 1966 Rule, it still had the latent potential to mislead.</p>\n<p>As the substance and operation of the Rule both pre- and post-2007 are unchanged, we will refer to the present, revised <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2185</span> version. The pre-2007 version is printed in the Appendix of this opinion. The current Rule states, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Rule 19. Required Joinder of Parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(a) Persons Required to Be Joined if Feasible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) Required Party. A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) in that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person's absence may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the interest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Joinder by Court Order. If a person has not been joined as required, the court must order that the person be made a party. A person who refuses to join as a plaintiff may be made either a defendant or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(3) Venue. If a joined party objects to venue and the joinder would make venue improper, the court must dismiss that party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) When Joinder Is Not Feasible. If a person who is required to be joined if feasible cannot be joined, the court must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed. The factors for the court to consider include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) protective provisions in the judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) shaping the relief; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) other measures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(3) whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence would be adequate; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder.\" Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 19(a)-(b).</blockquote>\n<p>See also Rule 19(c) (imposing pleading requirements); Rule 19(d) (creating exception for class actions).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In 1972, Ferdinand Marcos, then President of the Republic, incorporated Arelma, S.A. (Arelma), under Panamanian law. Around the same time, Arelma opened a brokerage account with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. (Merrill Lynch) in New York, in which it deposited $2 million. As of the year 2000, the account had grown to approximately $35 million.</p>\n<p>Alleged crimes and misfeasance by Marcos during his presidency became the subject of worldwide attention and protest. A class action by and on behalf of some 9,539 of his human rights victims was filed against Marcos and his estate, among others. The class action was tried in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii and resulted in a nearly $2 billion judgment for the class. See <i>Hilao v. Estate of Marcos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732382\"><a href=\"/opinion/732382/45-fed-r-evid-serv-913-96-cal-daily-op-serv-9090-9/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></a></span> (C.A.9 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2186</span> 1996). We refer to that litigation as the Pimentel case and to its class members as the Pimentel class. In a related action, the Estate of Roger Roxas and Golden Budha <i>[sic]</i> Corporation (the Roxas claimants) claim a right to execute against the assets to satisfy their own judgment against Marcos' widow, Imelda Marcos. See <i>Roxas v. Marcos,</i> 89 Hawai`i 91, 113-115, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405642\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405642/roxas-v-marcos/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span>, 1231-1233 (1998).</p>\n<p>The Pimentel class claims a right to enforce its judgment by attaching the Arelma assets held by Merrill Lynch. The Republic and the Commission claim a right to the assets under a 1955 Philippine law providing that property derived from the misuse of public office is forfeited to the Republic from the moment of misappropriation. See An Act Declaring Forfeiture in Favor of the State Any Property Found To Have Been Unlawfully Acquired by Any Public Officer or Employee and Providing for the Proceedings Therefor, Rep. Act No. 1379, 51:9 O.G. 4457 (June 18, 1955).</p>\n<p>After Marcos fled the Philippines in 1986, the Commission was created to recover any property he wrongfully took. Almost immediately the Commission asked the Swiss Government for assistance in recovering assets\u0097including shares in Arelma\u0097that Marcos had moved to Switzerland. In compliance the Swiss Government froze certain assets and, in 1990, that freeze was upheld by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court. In 1991, the Commission asked the Sandiganbayan, a Philippine court of special jurisdiction over corruption cases, to declare forfeited to the Republic any property Marcos had obtained through misuse of his office. That litigation is still pending in the Sandiganbayan.</p>\n<p>The Swiss assets were transferred to an escrow account set up by the Commission at the Philippine National Banc (PNB), pending the Sandiganbayan's decision as to their rightful owner. The Republic and the Commission requested that Merrill Lynch follow the same course and transfer the Arelma assets to an escrow account at PNB. Merrill Lynch did not do so. Facing claims from various Marcos creditors, including the Pimentel class, Merrill Lynch instead filed an interpleader action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1335. The named defendants in the interpleader action were, among others, the Republic and the Commission, Arelma, PNB, and the Pimentel class (the respondents here).</p>\n<p>The Pimentel case had been tried as a class action before Judge Manuel Real of the United States District Court for the Central District of California, who was sitting by designation in the District of Hawaii after the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the various human rights complaints against Marcos in that court. See <i>Hilao, supra,</i> at 771. Judge Real directed Merrill Lynch to file the interpleader action in the District of Hawaii, and he presided over the matter.</p>\n<p>After being named as defendants in the interpleader action, the Republic and the Commission asserted sovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604. They moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule 19(b), based on the premise that the action could not proceed without them. Arelma and PNB also moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule 19(b). Without addressing whether they were entitled to sovereign immunity, Judge Real initially rejected the request by the Republic and the Commission to dismiss the interpleader action. They appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed. It held the Republic and the Commission are entitled to sovereign immunity and that under Rule 19(a) they are required parties (or \"necessary\" parties under the old terminology). See <i>In re Republic of the Philippines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2679774\"><a href=\"/opinion/2679774/in-re-republic-of-the-philippines-in-re-presidenti/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></a></span>, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2187</span> 1149-1152 (C.A.9 2002). The Court of Appeals entered a stay pending the outcome of the litigation in the Sandiganbayan over the Marcos assets. See <i>id.,</i> at 1152-1153.</p>\n<p>After concluding that the pending litigation in the Sandiganbayan could not determine entitlement to the Arelma assets, Judge Real vacated the stay, allowed the action to proceed, and awarded the assets to the Pimentel class. A week later, in the case initiated before the Sandiganbayan in 1991, the Republic asked that court to declare the Arelma assets forfeited, arguing the matter was ripe for decision. The Sandiganbayan has not yet ruled.</p>\n<p>In the interpleader case the Republic, the Commission, Arelma, and PNB appealed the District Court's judgment in favor of the Pimentel claimants. This time the Court of Appeals affirmed. See <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith v. ENC Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795863\"><a href=\"/opinion/795863/no-04-16401/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span> (C.A.9 2006). Dismissal of the interpleader suit, it held, was not warranted under Rule 19(b) because, though the Republic and the Commission were required (\"necessary\") parties under Rule 19(a), their claim had so little likelihood of success on the merits that the interpleader action could proceed without them. One of the reasons the court gave was that any action commenced by the Republic and the Commission to recover the assets would be barred by New York's 6-year statute of limitations for claims involving the misappropriation of public property. See N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7 213 (West Supp.2008). The court thus found it unnecessary to consider whether any prejudice to the Republic and the Commission might be lessened by some form of judgment or interim decree in the interpleader action. The court also considered the failure of the Republic and the Commission to obtain a judgment in the Sandiganbayan\u0097despite the Arelma share certificates having been located and held in escrow at the PNB since 1997-1998\u0097to be an equitable consideration counseling against dismissal of the interpleader suit. The court further found it relevant that allowing the interpleader case to proceed would serve the interests of the Pimentel class, which, at this point, likely has no other available forum in which to enforce its judgment against property belonging to Marcos.</p>\n<p>This Court granted certiorari. See 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 705, 169 L.Ed.2d 552 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We begin with the question we asked the parties to address when we granted certiorari: Whether the Republic and the Commission, having been dismissed from the interpleader action based on their successful assertion of sovereign immunity, had the right to appeal the District Court's determination under Rule 19 that the action could proceed in their absence; and whether they have the right to seek this Court's review of the Court of Appeals' judgment affirming the District Court. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Respondents contend that the Republic and the Commission were not proper parties in the Court of Appeals when it reviewed the District Court's judgment allowing the action to proceed without them; and, respondents continue, the Republic and the Commission are not proper parties in the instant proceeding before us. See Brief for Respondent Pimentel 21.</p>\n<p>Without implying that respondents are correct in saying the Republic and the Commission could neither appeal nor become parties here, we conclude we need not rule on this point. Other parties before us, Arelma and PNB, also seek review of the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the District Court. They, too, moved to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2188</span> dismiss the action under Rule 19(b), appealed from the denial of their motion, and are petitioners before this Court. As a general matter any party may move to dismiss an action under Rule 19(b). A court with proper jurisdiction may also consider <i>sua sponte</i> the absence of a required person and dismiss for failure to join. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95591\"><a href=\"/opinion/95591/minnesota-v-northern-securities-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span>, 235, 22 S.Ct. 308, 46 L.Ed. 499 (1902); see also <i>Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patterson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107609\"><a href=\"/opinion/107609/provident-tradesmens-bank-trust-co-v-patterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>, 111, 88 S.Ct. 733, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968).</p>\n<p>Respondents argue, however, that Arelma and PNB have no standing to raise before this Court the question whether the action may proceed in the absence of the Republic and the Commission. Arelma and PNB lost on the merits of their underlying claims to the interpleaded assets in both the District Court and the Court of Appeals. By failing to petition for certiorari on that merits ruling, respondents contend, Arelma and PNB abandoned any entitlement to the interpleaded assets and therefore lack a concrete stake in the outcome of further proceedings. We disagree. Dismissal of the action under Rule 19(b) would benefit Arelma and PNB by vacating the judgment denying them the interpleaded assets. A party that seeks to have a judgment vacated in its entirety on procedural grounds does not lose standing simply because the party does not petition for certiorari on the substance of the order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We turn to the question whether the interpleader action could proceed in the District Court without the Republic and the Commission as parties.</p>\n<p>Subdivision (a) of Rule 19 states the principles that determine when persons or entities must be joined in a suit. The Rule instructs that nonjoinder even of a required person does not always result in dismissal. Subdivision (a) opens by noting that it addresses joinder \"if Feasible.\" Where joinder is not feasible, the question whether the action should proceed turns on the factors outlined in subdivision (b). The considerations set forth in subdivision (b) are nonexclusive, as made clear by the introductory statement that \"[t]he factors for the court to consider include.\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(b). The general direction is whether \"in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The design of the Rule, then, indicates that the determination whether to proceed will turn upon factors that are case specific, which is consistent with a Rule based on equitable considerations. This is also consistent with the fact that the determination of who may, or must, be parties to a suit has consequences for the persons and entities affected by the judgment; for the judicial system and its interest in the integrity of its processes and the respect accorded to its decrees; and for society and its concern for the fair and prompt resolution of disputes. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109680\"><a href=\"/opinion/109680/illinois-brick-co-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span>, 737-739, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977). For these reasons, the issue of joinder can be complex, and determinations are case specific. See, <i>e.g., Provident </i><i>Bank, supra,</i> at 118-119, 88 S.Ct. 733.</p>\n<p>Under the earlier Rules the term \"indispensable party\" might have implied a certain rigidity that would be in tension with this case-specific approach. The word \"indispensable\" had an unforgiving connotation that did not fit easily with a system that permits actions to proceed even when some persons who otherwise should be parties to the action cannot be joined. As the Court noted in <i>Provident Bank,</i> the use of \"indispensable\" in Rule 19 created <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2189</span> the \"verbal anomaly\" of an \"indispensable person who turns out to be dispensable after all.\" 390 U.S., at 117, n. 12, 88 S.Ct. 733. Though the text has changed, the new Rule 19 has the same design and, to some extent, the same tension. Required persons may turn out not to be required for the action to proceed after all.</p>\n<p>In all events it is clear that multiple factors must bear on the decision whether to proceed without a required person. This decision \"must be based on factors varying with the different cases, some such factors being substantive, some procedural, some compelling by themselves, and some subject to balancing against opposing interests.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 119, 88 S.Ct. 733.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>We turn to Rule 19 as it relates to this case. The application of subdivision (a) of Rule 19 is not contested. The Republic and the Commission are required entities because \"[w]ithout [them] as parties in this interpleader action, their interests in the subject matter are not protected.\" <i>In re Republic of Philippines,</i> 309 F.3d, at 1152; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)(1)(B)(i). All parties appear to concede this. The disagreement instead centers around the application of subdivision (b), which addresses whether the action may proceed without the Republic and the Commission, given that the Rule requires them to be parties.</p>\n<p>We have not addressed the standard of review for Rule 19(b) decisions. The case-specific inquiry that must be followed in applying the standards set forth in subdivision (b), including the direction to consider whether \"in equity and good conscience\" the case should proceed, implies some degree of deference to the district court. In this case, however, we find implicit in the District Court's rulings, and explicit in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, errors of law that require reversal. Whatever the appropriate standard of review, a point we need not decide, the judgment could not stand. Cf. <i>Koon v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 99-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (a court \"by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law\").</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals erred in not giving the necessary weight to the absent entities' assertion of sovereign immunity. The court in effect decided the merits of the Republic and the Commission's claims to the Arelma assets. Once it was recognized that those claims were not frivolous, it was error for the Court of Appeals to address them on their merits when the required entities had been granted sovereign immunity. The court's consideration of the merits was itself an infringement on foreign sovereign immunity; and, in any event, its analysis was flawed. We discuss these errors first in the context of how they affected the Court of Appeals' analysis under the first factor of Rule 19(b). We then explain that the outcome suggested by the first factor is confirmed by our analysis under the other provisions of Rule 19(b). The action may not proceed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As to the first Rule 19(b) factor\u0097the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(b)(1)\u0097the judgment of the Court of Appeals is incorrect.</p>\n<p>In considering whether the Republic and the Commission would be prejudiced if the action were to proceed in their absence, the Court of Appeals gave insufficient weight to their sovereign status. The doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity has been recognized since early in the history of our Nation. It is premised upon the \"perfect equality and absolute independence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2190</span> of sovereigns, and th[e] common interest impelling them to mutual intercourse.\" <i>Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon,</i> 7 Cranch 116, 137, 3 L.Ed. 287 (1812). The Court has observed that the doctrine is designed to \"give foreign states and their instrumentalities some protection from the inconvenience of suit,\" <i>Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127913\"><a href=\"/opinion/127913/dole-food-co-v-patrickson/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, 479, 123 S.Ct. 1655, 155 L.Ed.2d 643 (2003).</p>\n<p>The privilege is codified by federal statute. FSIA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330, 1602-1611, provides that \"a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States except as provided in sections 1605 to 1607,\" absent existing international agreements to the contrary. \u00a7 1604; see <i>Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110932\"><a href=\"/opinion/110932/verlinden-bv-v-central-bank-of-nigeria/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 486-489, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983) (explaining the history of the doctrine's codification). Exceptions to the general principle of foreign sovereign immunity are contained in \u00a7\u00a7 1605-1607 of the statute. They are inapplicable here, or at least the parties do not invoke them. Immunity in this case, then, is uncontested; and pursuant to the Court of Appeals' earlier ruling on the issue, the District Court dismissed the Republic and the Commission from the action on this ground.</p>\n<p>The District Court and the Court of Appeals failed to give full effect to sovereign immunity when they held the action could proceed without the Republic and the Commission. Giving full effect to sovereign immunity promotes the comity interests that have contributed to the development of the immunity doctrine. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 486, 103 S.Ct. 1962 (\"[F]oreign sovereign immunity is a matter of grace and comity\"); <i>National City Bank of N.Y. v. Republic of China,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105274\"><a href=\"/opinion/105274/national-city-bank-of-ny-v-republic-of-china/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, 362, and n. 7, 75 S.Ct. 423, 99 L.Ed. 389 (1955) (foreign sovereign immunity derives from \"standards of public morality, fair dealing, reciprocal self-interest, and respect for the `power and dignity' of the foreign sovereign\" (quoting <i>Schooner Exchange, supra,</i> at 136-137, 143-144)).</p>\n<p>Comity and dignity interests take concrete form in this case. The claims of the Republic and the Commission arise from events of historical and political significance for the Republic and its people. The Republic and the Commission have a unique interest in resolving the ownership of or claims to the Arelma assets and in determining if, and how, the assets should be used to compensate those persons who suffered grievous injury under Marcos. There is a comity interest in allowing a foreign state to use its own courts for a dispute if it has a right to do so. The dignity of a foreign state is not enhanced if other nations bypass its courts without right or good cause. Then, too, there is the more specific affront that could result to the Republic and the Commission if property they claim is seized by the decree of a foreign court. Cf. <i>Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104078\"><a href=\"/opinion/104078/republic-of-mexico-v-hoffman/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 35-36, 65 S.Ct. 530, 89 L.Ed. 729 (1945) (pre-FSIA, common-law doctrine dictated that courts defer to executive determination of immunity because \"[t]he judicial seizure\" of the property of a friendly state may be regarded as \"an affront to its dignity and may. . . affect our relations with it\").</p>\n<p>Though this Court has not considered a case posing the precise question presented here, there are some authorities involving the intersection of joinder and the governmental immunity of the United States. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Mine Safety Appliances Co. v. Forrestal,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></span>, 373-375, 66 S.Ct. 219, 90 L.Ed. 140 (1945) (dismissing an action where the Under Secretary of the Navy was sued in his official capacity, because the Government was a required entity that could not be joined when it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2191</span> withheld consent to be sued); <i>Minnesota v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103115\"><a href=\"/opinion/103115/minnesota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 386-388, 59 S.Ct. 292, 83 L.Ed. 235 (1939) (dismissing the action for nonjoinder of a required entity where the United States was the owner of the land in question but had not consented to suit). The analysis of the joinder issue in those cases was somewhat perfunctory, but the holdings were clear: A case may not proceed when a required-entity sovereign is not amenable to suit. These cases instruct us that where sovereign immunity is asserted, and the claims of the sovereign are not frivolous, dismissal of the action must be ordered where there is a potential for injury to the interests of the absent sovereign.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals accordingly erred in undertaking to rule on the merits of the Republic and the Commission's claims. There may be cases where the person who is not joined asserts a claim that is frivolous. In that instance a court may have leeway under both Rule 19(a)(1), defining required parties, and Rule 19(b), addressing when a suit may go forward nonetheless, to disregard the frivolous claim. Here, the claims of the absent entities are not frivolous; and the Court of Appeals should not have proceeded on the premise that those claims would be determined against the sovereign entities that asserted immunity.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals determined that the claims of the Republic and the Commission as to the assets would not succeed because a suit would be time barred in New York. This is not necessarily so. If the Sandiganbayan rules that the Republic owns the assets or stock of Arelma because Marcos did not own them and the property was forfeited to the Republic under Philippine law, then New York misappropriation rules might not be the applicable law. For instance, the Republic and the Commission, standing in for Arelma based upon the Sandiganbayan's judgment, might not pursue a misappropriation of public property suit, as the Court of Appeals assumed they would. They might instead, or in the alternative, file suit for breach of contract against Merrill Lynch. They would argue the statute of limitations would start to run if and when Merrill Lynch refused to hand over the assets. See N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7 213 (West Supp.2008); <i>Ely-Cruikshank Co. v. Bank of Montreal,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></span>, 402, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">599</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></span>, 986 (1993) (\"In New York, a breach of contract cause of action accrues at the time of the breach\"). Or the Republic and the Commission might bring an action either in state or federal court to enforce the Sandiganbayan's judgment. See 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 482, Comment <i>a</i> (1986) (jurisdiction of foreign court rendering judgment is presumed); <i>id.,</i> at Comment <i>d</i> (providing exceptions not relevant here); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2467(c) (providing for enforcement of foreign forfeiture judgments in certain circumstances). Merrill Lynch makes arguments why these actions would not succeed, see Brief for Merrill Lynch as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 26-27, to which the Republic, the Commission, and the United States respond, see Reply Brief for Petitioners 14-18; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 24-28. We need not seek to predict the outcomes. It suffices that the claims would not be frivolous.</p>\n<p>As these comments indicate, Rule 19 cannot be applied in a vacuum, and it may require some preliminary assessment of the merits of certain claims. For example, the Rule directs a court, in determining who is a required person, to consider whether complete relief can be afforded in their absence. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)(1)(A). Likewise, in the Rule 19(b) inquiry, a court must examine, to some extent, the claims presented and the interests <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2192</span> likely to be asserted both by the joined parties and the absent entities or persons. Here, however, it was improper to issue a definitive holding regarding a nonfrivolous, substantive claim made by an absent, required entity that was entitled by its sovereign status to immunity from suit. That privilege is much diminished if an important and consequential ruling affecting the sovereign's substantial interest is determined, or at least assumed, by a federal court in the sovereign's absence and over its objection.</p>\n<p>As explained above, the decision to proceed in the absence of the Republic and the Commission ignored the substantial prejudice those entities likely would incur. This most directly implicates Rule 19(b)'s first factor, which directs consideration of prejudice both to absent persons and those who are parties. We have discussed the absent entities. As to existing parties, we do not discount the Pimentel class' interest in recovering damages it was awarded pursuant to a judgment. Furthermore, combating public corruption is a significant international policy. The policy is manifested in treaties providing for international cooperation in recovering forfeited assets. See, <i>e.g.,</i> United Nations Convention Against Corruption, G. &amp; A. Res. 5814, chs. IV and V, U.N. Doc. A/RES/58/4, pp. 22, 32 (Dec. 11, 2003) (reprinted in 43 I.L.M. 37 (2004)); Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Art. 16, Nov. 13, 1994, S. Treaty Doc. No. 104-18 (1995). This policy does support the interest of the Pimentel class in recovering damages awarded to it. But it also underscores the important comity concerns implicated by the Republic and the Commission in asserting foreign sovereign immunity. The error is not that the District Court and the Court of Appeals gave too much weight to the interest of the Pimentel class, but that it did not accord proper weight to the compelling claim of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p>Based on these considerations we conclude the District Court and the Court of Appeals gave insufficient weight to the likely prejudice to the Republic and the Commission should the interpleader proceed in their absence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>As to the second Rule 19(b) factor\u0097the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by relief or measures alternative to dismissal, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(b)(2)\u0097there is no substantial argument to allow the action to proceed. No alternative remedies or forms of relief have been proposed to us or appear to be available. See 7 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1608, pp. 106-110 (3d ed.2001) (collecting cases using alternative forms of relief, including the granting of money damages rather than specific performance, the use of declaratory judgment, and the direction that payment be withheld pending suits against the absent party). If the Marcos estate did not own the assets, or if the Republic owns them now, the claim of the Pimentel class likely fails; and in all events, if there are equally valid but competing claims, that too would require adjudication in a case where the Republic and the Commission are parties. See <i>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Tashire,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107407\"><a href=\"/opinion/107407/state-farm-fire-casualty-co-v-tashire/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span>, 534, and n. 16, 87 S.Ct. 1199, 18 L.Ed.2d 270 (1967); <i>Russell v.

Rule Civ. Proc. 19(b)(3)\u0097the Court of Appeals understood \"adequacy\" to refer to satisfaction of the Pimentel class' claims. But adequacy refers to the \"public stake in settling disputes by wholes, whenever possible.\" <i>Provident Bank,</i> 390 U.S., at 111, 88 S.Ct. 733. This \"social interest in the efficient administration of justice and the avoidance of multiple litigation\" is an interest that has \"traditionally been thought to support compulsory joinder of absent and potentially adverse claimants.\" <i>Illinois Brick Co.,</i> 431 U.S., at 737-738, 97 S.Ct. 2061. Going forward with the action without the Republic and the Commission would not further the public interest in settling the dispute as a whole because the Republic and the Commission would not be bound by the judgment in an action where they were not parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>As to the fourth Rule 19(b) factor\u0097 whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(b)(4)\u0097the Court of Appeals made much of what it considered the tort victims' lack of an alternative forum should this action be dismissed. This seems to assume the plaintiff in this interpleader action was the Pimentel class. It is Merrill Lynch, however, that has the statutory status of plaintiff as the stakeholder in the interpleader action.</p>\n<p>It is true that, in an interpleader action, the stakeholder is often neutral as to the outcome, while other parties press claims in the manner of a plaintiff. That is insufficient, though, to overcome the statement in the interpleader statute that the stakeholder is the plaintiff. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1335(a) (conditioning jurisdiction in part upon whether \"the plaintiff has deposited such money or property\" at issue with the district court or has \"given bond payable to the clerk of the court in such amount and with such surety as the court or judge may deem proper\"). We do not ignore that, in context, the Pimentel class (and indeed all interpleader claimants) are to some extent comparable to the plaintiffs in noninterpleader cases. Their interests are not irrelevant to the Rule 19(b) equitable balance; but the other provisions of the Rule are the relevant ones to consult.</p>\n<p>Merrill Lynch, as the stakeholder, makes the point that if the action is dismissed it loses the benefit of a judgment allowing it to disburse the assets and be done with the matter. Dismissal of the action, it urges, leaves it without an adequate remedy, for it \"could potentially be forced . . . to defend lawsuits by the various claimants in different jurisdictions, possibly leading to inconsistent judgments.\" Brief for Merrill Lynch as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 14. A dismissal of the action on the ground of nonjoinder, however, will protect Merrill Lynch in some respects. That disposition will not provide Merrill Lynch with a judgment determining the party entitled to the assets, but it likely would provide Merrill Lynch with an effective defense against piecemeal litigation and inconsistent, conflicting judgments. As matters presently stand, in any later suit against it Merrill Lynch may seek to join the Republic and the Commission and have the action dismissed under Rule 19(b) should they again assert sovereign immunity. Dismissal for nonjoinder to some extent will serve the purpose of interpleader, which is to prevent a stakeholder from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2194</span> having to pay two or more parties for one claim.</p>\n<p>Any prejudice to Merrill Lynch in this regard is outweighed by prejudice to the absent entities invoking sovereign immunity. Dismissal under Rule 19(b) will mean, in some instances, that plaintiffs will be left without a forum for definitive resolution of their claims. But that result is contemplated under the doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Verlinden,</i> 461 U.S., at 497, 103 S.Ct. 1962 (\"[I]f a court determines that none of the exceptions to sovereign immunity applies, the plaintiff will be barred from raising his claim in any court in the United States\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals' failure to give sufficient weight to the likely prejudice to the Republic and the Commission should the interpleader proceed in their absence would, in the usual course, warrant reversal and remand for further proceedings. In this case, however, that error and our further analysis under the additional provisions of Rule 19(b) lead us to conclude the action must be dismissed. This leaves the Pimentel class, which has waited for years now to be compensated for grievous wrongs, with no immediate way to recover on its judgment against Marcos. And it leaves Merrill Lynch, the stakeholder, without a judgment.</p>\n<p>The balance of equities may change in due course. One relevant change may occur if it appears that the Sandiganbayan cannot or will not issue its ruling within a reasonable period of time. Other changes could result when and if there is a ruling. If the Sandiganbayan rules that the Republic and the Commission have no right to the assets, their claims in some later interpleader suit would be less substantial than they are now. If the ruling is that the Republic and the Commission own the assets, then they may seek to enforce a judgment in our courts; or consent to become parties in an interpleader suit, where their claims could be considered; or file in some other forum if they can obtain jurisdiction over the relevant persons. We do note that if Merrill Lynch, or other parties, elect to commence further litigation in light of changed circumstances, it would not be necessary to file the new action in the District Court where this action arose, provided venue and jurisdictional requirements are satisfied elsewhere. The present action, however, may not proceed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to order the District Court to dismiss the inter-pleader action.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals issued its decision before the 2007 Amendments to Rule 19(b) became effective. See <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith v. ENC Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795863\"><a href=\"/opinion/795863/no-04-16401/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 891 (C.A.9 2006). The text of the Rule before those changes were adopted is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Rule 19. Joinder of Persons Needed for Just Adjudication</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(a) Persons to be Joined if Feasible. A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2195</span> of the action in the person's absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest. If the person has not been so joined, the court shall order that the person be made a party. If the person should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, the person may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff. If the joined party objects to venue and joinder of that party would render the venue of the action improper, that party shall be dismissed from the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) Determination by Court Whenever Joinder not Feasible. If a person as described in subdivision (a)(1)-(2) hereof cannot be made a party, the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable. The factors to be considered by the court include: first, to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(c) Pleading Reasons for Nonjoinder. A pleading asserting a claim for relief shall state the names, if known to the pleader, of any persons as prescribed in subdivision (a)(1)-(2) hereof who are not joined, and the reasons why they are not joined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(d) Exception of Class Actions. This rule is subject to the provisions of Rule 23.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>While I join Part II of the Court's opinion holding that we have jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals' decision and agree that we should not affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment on the merits of its analysis under Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, I believe the appropriate disposition of this case is to reverse and remand for further proceedings. The District Court and the Ninth Circuit erred by concluding that the New York statute of limitations provides a virtually insuperable obstacle to petitioners' recovery of the Arelma, S. A., assets, and I therefore agree that this Court should reverse. I would not, however, give near-dispositive effect to the Republic of the Philippines (Republic) and the Philippine Presidential Commission on Good Governance's (Commission) status as sovereign entities, as the Court does in ordering outright dismissal of the case.</p>\n<p>In my judgment, the Court of Appeals should either order the District Judge to stay further proceedings pending a reasonably prompt decision of the Sandiganbayan or order the case reassigned to a different District Judge to conduct further proceedings. There is, of course, a risk of unfairness in conducting such proceedings without the participation of petitioners. But it is a risk that they can avoid by waiving their sovereign immunity, and the record provides a basis for believing that they would do so if the case proceeded before a different judge.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2196</span> The Republic did not invoke its sovereign immunity until after the District Court denied its motion seeking dismissal or transfer for improper venue, dismissal on act of state grounds, or recusal of the District Judge. App. 9; <i>id.,</i> at 2-3 (docket entries). In support of that motion they advanced a factual basis for suspecting that the District Judge's impartiality could be questioned. Memorandum of Law in Support of the Motions to Dismiss, Transfer or Stay, and For Recusal 23-28 in Civ. No. CV00-595MLR (D.Haw.). These facts demonstrate that the District Judge would likely \"have substantial difficulty in putting out of his or her mind previously-expressed views.\" <i>California v. Montrose Chemical Corp. of California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733383\"><a href=\"/opinion/733383/state-of-california-v-montrose-chemical-corporatio/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1507</span></a></span>, 1521 (C.A.9 1997) (providing the standard for when the Ninth Circuit will reassign a case; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>It appears, for example, that the District Judge summoned an attorney representing Merrill Lynch to a meeting in chambers in Los Angeles on September 11, 2000, after learning that the Republic and the Commission sought to obtain the Arelma funds from Merrill Lynch. During these proceedings, the District Judge directed Merrill Lynch to file an interpleader action before him in the District of Hawaii and to deposit the Arelma funds with the court, despite the attorney's argument that New York would likely be the more appropriate forum. See <i>ante,</i> at 2186-2187; Tr. 6 (Sept. 11, 2000). Merrill Lynch filed the interpleader on September 14, 2000, and the District Judge sealed the file, making it difficult for other parties to determine the status of the proceedings. See Affidavit of Richard A. Martin in Support of the Motions to Dismiss, Transfer, or Stay Submitted by the Republic of the Philippines and the Presidential Commission on Good Government in Civ. No. CV00-595MLR (D.Haw.), \u00b6 6-7, 11. These actions be-speak a level of personal involvement and desire to control the Marcos proceedings that create at least a colorable basis for the Republic and the Commission's concern about the District Judge's impartiality.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, following the Republic and the Commission's motion to dismiss the action on sovereign immunity grounds, the District Judge decided that they were not \"real parties in interest.\" See <i>In re Republic of Philippines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2679774\"><a href=\"/opinion/2679774/in-re-republic-of-the-philippines-in-re-presidenti/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></a></span>, 1148 (C.A.9 2002). The Ninth Circuit reversed and directed the District Judge to enter a stay, <i>id.,</i> at 1153; the District Court did so, but vacated the stay within months. While the District Court's decision to do so was not without some basis, it presumably increased concern about the possibility that the District Judge would not fairly consider the Republic's position on the merits.</p>\n<p>Upon reassignment, the question whether to dismiss the case, to stay the proceedings, or to require the Republic to choose between asserting its sovereign immunity and defending on the merits would be open. The District Judge might wish to hold a hearing to determine whether the Republic and the Commission have a substantial argument that the Republic owned the disputed assets when they were conveyed to Arelma in 1972. While the Court assumes that the Republic's interest in the Arelma assets is \"not frivolous,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2191, on this record, it is not clear whether the Republic has a sufficient claim to those assets to preclude their recovery by judgment creditors of Marcos. The Republic's claim to disputed assets may be meritless for reasons unrelated to the potential statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>Further, in conducting the balancing inquiry mandated by Rule 19, as interpreted by Justice Harlan's opinion for the Court in <i>Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2197</span> <i>Co. v. Patterson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107609\"><a href=\"/opinion/107609/provident-tradesmens-bank-trust-co-v-patterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>, 88 S.Ct. 733, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968), I would conclude that several facts specific to this case suggest that the Republic and the Commission's sovereign interests should be given less weight than in the ordinary case. First, in all events, the Republic and the Commission must take affirmative steps in United States courts (or possibly invoke the assistance of the Attorney General to do so, see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27) <i>at some point</i> in order to recover the assets held in the United States. Thus, the sovereign interest implicated here is not of the same magnitude as when a sovereign faces liability; the Republic's interest is in choosing the most convenient venue and time for the suit to proceed.</p>\n<p>Second, in the past two decades, the Republic has participated in other proceedings involving Marcos' assets in our courts without interposing any objection. Indeed, in 1987 it filed an <i>amicus</i> brief with the Ninth Circuit in the underlying consolidated class action that led to the entry of respondents' judgment against Marcos; in that brief the Republic urged the Ninth Circuit to reverse the District Judge's dismissal of two of the cases (later consolidated) under the act of state doctrine and \"to allow the Plaintiffs in those two cases to present their evidence of gross human rights violations against Ferdinand Marcos and to pursue justice in U.S. District Court.\" App. A to Brief for Respondent Pimentel RA-1.</p>\n<p>This was the Republic's position notwithstanding the fact that any recovery would come from a judgment against Marcos' assets\u0097assets that the Republic and the Commission now claim to have owned in full from the moment Marcos acquired them. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Republic in Nos. 04-16401, 04-16503, and 04-16538(CA9), p. 9 (\"Under Philippine law, assets resulting from the misuse of public office, bribery, corruption, and other such crimes by public officials are forfeit to the Republic from the moment such assets are generated\"); Pet. for Republic in No. 0141 (Sandiganbayon) (filed 1991) (seeking forfeiture of a large number of Marcos assets). Even if the Republic believed that Marcos might have some personal assets that were not ill gotten, under the Republic's theory that amount could not possibly have approached the judgment respondents received. Either the Republic was encouraging futile and purely symbolic litigation, or the Republic believed that other creditors would have access to at least a portion of Marcos' vast assets.</p>\n<p>In sum, I am persuaded that the Court's judgment today represents a more \"inflexible approach\" than the Rule contemplates. <i>Provident,</i> 390 U.S., at 107, 88 S.Ct. 733. All parties have an interest in the prompt resolution of the disposition of the Arelma assets. A remand would allow a new judge to handle the matter in an expeditious fashion rather than requiring a brand new proceeding. The Court suggests that Merrill Lynch may file in another District Court\u0097presumably in New York\u0097if it seeks to commence further litigation. See <i>ante,</i> at 2194. While this solution would put the matter before another District Judge, it requires the initiation of a new proceeding that may unnecessarily delay the final resolution.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I join all but Parts IV-B and V of the Court's opinion. I differ as to relief because a conclusion of the matter pending before the Sandiganbayan may simplify the issues raised in this case and render one disposition or another more clearly correct. I would therefore vacate the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2198</span> judgment and remand for a stay of proceedings for a reasonable time to await a decree of the Philippine court. If it should appear later that no such decree can be expected, the Court of Appeals could decide on the next step in light of the Court's opinion. For reasons given by Justice STEVENS, I would order that any further proceedings in the District Court be held before a judge fresh to the case.</p>\n</div>",
