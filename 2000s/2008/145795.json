Cmdr. William C. Kuebler, Rebecca Snyder, Office of Military Commissions, Washington, D.C., for Respondent Omar Khadr.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioners are aliens designated as enemy combatants and detained at the United States Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. There are others detained there, also aliens, who are not parties to this suit.</p>\n<p>Petitioners present a question not resolved by our earlier cases relating to the detention of aliens at Guantanamo: whether they have the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus, a privilege not to be withdrawn except in conformance with the Suspension Clause, Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. We hold these petitioners do have the habeas corpus privilege. Congress has enacted a statute, the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005(DTA), 119 Stat. 2739, that provides certain procedures for review of the detainees' status. We hold that those procedures are not an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus. Therefore \u00a7 7 of the Military Commissions Act of 2006(MCA), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(e) (Supp. 2007), operates as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. We do not address whether the President has authority to detain these petitioners nor do we hold that the writ must issue. These and other questions regarding the legality of the detention are to be resolved in the first instance by the District Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), \u00a7 2(a), 115 Stat. 224, note following 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1541 (2000 ed., Supp. V), the President is authorized \"to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.\"</p>\n<p>In <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,</i> 542 U.S. 507, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004), five Members of the Court recognized that detention of individuals who fought against the United States in Afghanistan \"for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2241</span> duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured, is so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the `necessary and appropriate force' Congress has authorized the President to use.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 518, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.), <i>id.,</i> at 588-589, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). After <i>Hamdi,</i> the Deputy Secretary of Defense established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) to determine whether individuals detained at Guantanamo were \"enemy combatants,\" as the Department defines that term. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1195, p. 81a. A later memorandum established procedures to implement the CSRTs. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, p. 147. The Government maintains these procedures were designed to comply with the due process requirements identified by the plurality in <i>Hamdi.</i> See Brief for Respondents 10.</p>\n<p>Interpreting the AUMF, the Department of Defense ordered the detention of these petitioners, and they were transferred to Guantanamo. Some of these individuals were apprehended on the battlefield in Afghanistan, others in places as far away from there as Bosnia and Gambia. All are foreign nationals, but none is a citizen of a nation now at war with the United States. Each denies he is a member of the al Qaeda terrorist network that carried out the September 11 attacks or of the Taliban regime that provided sanctuary for al Qaeda. Each petitioner appeared before a separate CSRT; was determined to be an enemy combatant; and has sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p>The first actions commenced in February 2002. The District Court ordered the cases dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the naval station is outside the sovereign territory of the United States. See <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> 215 F.Supp.2d 55 (2002). The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. See <i>Al Odah v. United States,</i> 321 F.3d 1134, 1145 (2003). We granted certiorari and reversed, holding that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 extended statutory habeas corpus jurisdiction to Guantanamo. See <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> 542 U.S. 466, 473, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004). The constitutional issue presented in the instant cases was not reached in <i>Rasul. Id.,</i> at 476, 124 S.Ct. 2686.</p>\n<p>After <i>Rasul,</i> petitioners' cases were consolidated and entertained in two separate proceedings. In the first set of cases, Judge Richard J. Leon granted the Government's motion to dismiss, holding that the detainees had no rights that could be vindicated in a habeas corpus action. In the second set of cases Judge Joyce Hens Green reached the opposite conclusion, holding the detainees had rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See <i>Khalid v. Bush,</i> 355 F.Supp.2d 311, 314 (DDC 2005); <i>In re Guantanamo Detainee Cases,</i> 355 F.Supp.2d 443, 464 (DDC 2005).</p>\n<p>While appeals were pending from the District Court decisions, Congress passed the DTA. Subsection (e) of \u00a7 1005 of the DTA amended 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 to provide that \"no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider ... an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\" 119 Stat. 2742. Section 1005 further provides that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit shall have \"exclusive\" jurisdiction to review decisions of the CSRTs. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld,</i> 548 U.S. 557, 576-577, 126 S.Ct. 2749, 165 L.Ed.2d 723 (2006), the Court held this provision did <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2242</span> not apply to cases (like petitioners') pending when the DTA was enacted. Congress responded by passing the MCA, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 948a <i>et seq.</i> (Supp.2007), which again amended \u00a7 2241. The text of the statutory amendment is discussed below. See Part II, <i>infra.</i> (Four Members of the <i>Hamdan</i> majority noted that \"[n]othing prevent[ed] the President from returning to Congress to seek the authority he believes necessary.\" 548 U.S., at 636, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (BREYER, J., concurring). The authority to which the concurring opinion referred was the authority to \"create military commissions of the kind at issue\" in the case. <i>Ibid.</i> Nothing in that opinion can be construed as an invitation for Congress to suspend the writ.)</p>\n<p>Petitioners' cases were consolidated on appeal, and the parties filed supplemental briefs in light of our decision in <i>Hamdan.</i> The Court of Appeals' ruling, 476 F.3d 981 (C.A.D.C.2007), is the subject of our present review and today's decision.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals concluded that MCA \u00a7 7 must be read to strip from it, and all federal courts, jurisdiction to consider petitioners' habeas corpus applications, <i>id.,</i> at 987; that petitioners are not entitled to the privilege of the writ or the protections of the Suspension Clause, <i>id.,</i> at 990-991; and, as a result, that it was unnecessary to consider whether Congress provided an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus in the DTA.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari. 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 3067, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>As a threshold matter, we must decide whether MCA \u00a7 7 denies the federal courts jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus actions pending at the time of its enactment. We hold the statute does deny that jurisdiction, so that, if the statute is valid, petitioners' cases must be dismissed.</p>\n<p>As amended by the terms of the MCA, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(e) (Supp.2007) now provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the United States who has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Except as provided in [\u00a7\u00a7 1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) of the DTA] no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any other action against the United States or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement of an alien who is or was detained by the United States and has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Section 7(b) of the MCA provides the effective date for the amendment of \u00a7 2241(e). It states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The amendment made by [MCA \u00a7 7(a)] shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply to all cases, without exception, pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act which relate to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of detention of an alien detained by the United States since September 11, 2001.\" 120 Stat. 2636.</blockquote>\n<p>There is little doubt that the effective date provision applies to habeas corpus actions. Those actions, by definition, are cases \"which relate to ... detention.\" See Black's Law Dictionary 728 (8th ed.2004) (defining habeas corpus as \"[a] writ employed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2243</span> to bring a person before a court, most frequently to ensure that the party's imprisonment or detention is not illegal\"). Petitioners argue, nevertheless, that MCA \u00a7 7(b) is not a sufficiently clear statement of congressional intent to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction in pending cases. See <i>Ex parte Yerger,</i> 8 Wall. 85, 102-103, 19 L.Ed. 332 (1869). We disagree.</p>\n<p>Their argument is as follows: Section 2241(e)(1) refers to \"a writ of habeas corpus.\" The next paragraph, \u00a7 2241(e)(2), refers to \"any other action ... relating to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement of an alien who ... [has] been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.\" There are two separate paragraphs, the argument continues, so there must be two distinct classes of cases. And the effective date subsection, MCA \u00a7 7(b), it is said, refers only to the second class of cases, for it largely repeats the language of \u00a7 2241(e)(2) by referring to \"cases ... which relate to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of detention of an alien detained by the United States.\"</p>\n<p>Petitioners' textual argument would have more force were it not for the phrase \"other action\" in \u00a7 2241(e)(2). The phrase cannot be understood without referring back to the paragraph that precedes it, \u00a7 2241(e)(1), which explicitly mentions the term \"writ of habeas corpus.\" The structure of the two paragraphs implies that habeas actions are a type of action \"relating to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement of an alien who is or was detained... as an enemy combatant.\" Pending habeas actions, then, are in the category of cases subject to the statute's jurisdictional bar.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge, moreover, the litigation history that prompted Congress to enact the MCA. In <i>Hamdan</i> the Court found it unnecessary to address the petitioner's Suspension Clause arguments but noted the relevance of the clear statement rule in deciding whether Congress intended to reach pending habeas corpus cases. See 548 U.S., at 575, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (Congress should \"not be presumed to have effected such denial [of habeas relief] absent an unmistakably clear statement to the contrary\"). This interpretive rule facilitates a dialogue between Congress and the Court. Cf. <i>Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n,</i> 502 U.S. 197, 206, 112 S.Ct. 560, 116 L.Ed.2d 560 (1991); H. Hart &amp; A. Sacks, The Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law 1209-1210 (W. Eskridge &amp; P. Frickey eds.1994). If the Court invokes a clear statement rule to advise that certain statutory interpretations are favored in order to avoid constitutional difficulties, Congress can make an informed legislative choice either to amend the statute or to retain its existing text. If Congress amends, its intent must be respected even if a difficult constitutional question is presented. The usual presumption is that Members of Congress, in accord with their oath of office, considered the constitutional issue and determined the amended statute to be a lawful one; and the Judiciary, in light of that determination, proceeds to its own independent judgment on the constitutional question when required to do so in a proper case.</p>\n<p>If this ongoing dialogue between and among the branches of Government is to be respected, we cannot ignore that the MCA was a direct response to <i>Hamdan</i>'s holding that the DTA's jurisdiction-stripping provision had no application to pending cases. The Court of Appeals was correct to take note of the legislative history when construing the statute, see 476 F.3d, at 986, n. 2 (citing relevant floor statements); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2244</span> and we agree with its conclusion that the MCA deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain the habeas corpus actions now before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In deciding the constitutional questions now presented we must determine whether petitioners are barred from seeking the writ or invoking the protections of the Suspension Clause either because of their status, <i>i.e.,</i> petitioners' designation by the Executive Branch as enemy combatants, or their physical location, <i>i.e.,</i> their presence at Guantanamo Bay. The Government contends that noncitizens designated as enemy combatants and detained in territory located outside our Nation's borders have no constitutional rights and no privilege of habeas corpus. Petitioners contend they do have cognizable constitutional rights and that Congress, in seeking to eliminate recourse to habeas corpus as a means to assert those rights, acted in violation of the Suspension Clause.</p>\n<p>We begin with a brief account of the history and origins of the writ. Our account proceeds from two propositions. First, protection for the privilege of habeas corpus was one of the few safeguards of liberty specified in a Constitution that, at the outset, had no Bill of Rights. In the system conceived by the Framers the writ had a centrality that must inform proper interpretation of the Suspension Clause. Second, to the extent there were settled precedents or legal commentaries in 1789 regarding the extraterritorial scope of the writ or its application to enemy aliens, those authorities can be instructive for the present cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Framers viewed freedom from unlawful restraint as a fundamental precept of liberty, and they understood the writ of habeas corpus as a vital instrument to secure that freedom. Experience taught, however, that the common-law writ all too often had been insufficient to guard against the abuse of monarchial power. That history counseled the necessity for specific language in the Constitution to secure the writ and ensure its place in our legal system.</p>\n<p>Magna Carta decreed that no man would be imprisoned contrary to the law of the land. Art. 39, in Sources of Our Liberties 17 (R. Perry &amp; J. Cooper eds. 1959) (\"No free man shall be taken or imprisoned or dispossessed, or outlawed, or banished, or in any way destroyed, nor will we go upon him, nor send upon him, except by the legal judgment of his peers or by the law of the land\"). Important as the principle was, the Barons at Runnymede prescribed no specific legal process to enforce it. Holdsworth tells us, however, that gradually the writ of habeas corpus became the means by which the promise of Magna Carta was fulfilled. 9 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 112 (1926) (hereinafter Holdsworth).</p>\n<p>The development was painstaking, even by the centuries-long measures of English constitutional history. The writ was known and used in some form at least as early as the reign of Edward I. <i>Id.,</i> at 108-125. Yet at the outset it was used to protect not the rights of citizens but those of the King and his courts. The early courts were considered agents of the Crown, designed to assist the King in the exercise of his power. See J. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History 38-39 (4th ed.2002). Thus the writ, while it would become part of the foundation of liberty for the King's subjects, was in its earliest use a mechanism for securing compliance with the King's laws. See Halliday &amp; White, The Suspension Clause: English Text, Imperial Contexts, and American <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2245</span> Implications, 94 Va. L.Rev. (forthcoming 2008) (hereinafter Halliday &amp; White) (manuscript, at 11, online at http://papers. ssrn.com/sol3 /papers.cfm?abstract_id=1008252 (all Internet materials as visited June 9, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (noting that \"conceptually the writ arose from a theory of power rather than a theory of liberty\")). Over time it became clear that by issuing the writ of habeas corpus common-law courts sought to enforce the King's prerogative to inquire into the authority of a jailer to hold a prisoner. See M. Hale, Prerogatives of the King 229 (D. Yale ed.1976); 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 1341, p. 237 (3d ed. 1858) (noting that the writ ran \"into all parts of the king's dominions; for it is said, that the king is entitled, at all times, to have an account, why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained\").</p>\n<p>Even so, from an early date it was understood that the King, too, was subject to the law. As the writers said of Magna Carta, \"it means this, that the king is and shall be below the law.\" 1 F. Pollock &amp; F. Maitland, History of English Law 173 (2d ed.1909); see also 2 Bracton On the Laws and Customs of England 33 (S. Thorne transl. 1968) (\"The king must not be under man but under God and under the law, because law makes the king\"). And, by the 1600's, the writ was deemed less an instrument of the King's power and more a restraint upon it. See Collings, Habeas Corpus for Convicts\u0097Constitutional Right or Legislative Grace, 40 Calif. L.Rev. 335, 336 (1952) (noting that by this point the writ was \"the appropriate process for checking illegal imprisonment by public officials\").</p>\n<p>Still, the writ proved to be an imperfect check. Even when the importance of the writ was well understood in England, habeas relief often was denied by the courts or suspended by Parliament. Denial or suspension occurred in times of political unrest, to the anguish of the imprisoned and the outrage of those in sympathy with them.</p>\n<p>A notable example from this period was <i>Darnel's Case,</i> 3 How. St. Tr. 1 (K.B.1627). The events giving rise to the case began when, in a display of the Stuart penchant for authoritarian excess, Charles I demanded that Darnel and at least four others lend him money. Upon their refusal, they were imprisoned. The prisoners sought a writ of habeas corpus; and the King filed a return in the form of a warrant signed by the Attorney General. <i>Ibid.</i> The court held this was a sufficient answer and justified the subjects' continued imprisonment. <i>Id.,</i> at 59.</p>\n<p>There was an immediate outcry of protest. The House of Commons promptly passed the Petition of Right, 3 Car. 1, ch. 1 (1627), 5 Statutes of the Realm 23, 24 (reprint 1963), which condemned executive \"imprison[ment] without any cause\" shown, and declared that \"no freeman in any such manner as is before mencioned [shall] be imprisoned or deteined.\" Yet a full legislative response was long delayed. The King soon began to abuse his authority again, and Parliament was dissolved. See W. Hall &amp; R. Albion, A History of England and the British Empire 328 (3d ed.1953) (hereinafter Hall &amp; Albion). When Parliament reconvened in 1640, it sought to secure access to the writ by statute. The Act of 1640, 16 Car. 1, ch. 10, 5 Statutes of the Realm, at 110, expressly authorized use of the writ to test the legality of commitment by command or warrant of the King or the Privy Council. Civil strife and the Interregnum soon followed, and not until 1679 did Parliament try once more to secure the writ, this time through the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 31 Car. 2, ch. 2, <i>id.,</i> at 935. The Act, which later <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2246</span> would be described by Blackstone as the \"stable bulwark of our liberties,\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *137 (hereinafter Blackstone), established procedures for issuing the writ; and it was the model upon which the habeas statutes of the 13 American Colonies were based, see Collings, <i>supra,</i> at 338-339.</p>\n<p>This history was known to the Framers. It no doubt confirmed their view that pendular swings to and away from individual liberty were endemic to undivided, uncontrolled power. The Framers' inherent distrust of governmental power was the driving force behind the constitutional plan that allocated powers among three independent branches. This design serves not only to make Government accountable but also to secure individual liberty. See <i>Loving v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 748, 756, 116 S.Ct. 1737, 135 L.Ed.2d 36 (1996) (noting that \"[e]ven before the birth of this country, separation of powers was known to be a defense against tyranny\"); cf. <i>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer,</i> 343 U.S. 579, 635, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring) (\"[T]he Constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty\"); <i>Clinton v. City of New York,</i> 524 U.S. 417, 450, 118 S.Ct. 2091, 141 L.Ed.2d 393 (1998) (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (\"Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress the separation of powers\"). Because the Constitution's separation-of-powers structure, like the substantive guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, see <i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins,</i> 118 U.S. 356, 374, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886), protects persons as well as citizens, foreign nationals who have the privilege of litigating in our courts can seek to enforce separation-of-powers principles, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>INS v. Chadha,</i> 462 U.S. 919, 958-959, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983).</p>\n<p>That the Framers considered the writ a vital instrument for the protection of individual liberty is evident from the care taken to specify the limited grounds for its suspension: \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2; see Amar, Of Sovereignty and Federalism, 96 Yale L.J. 1425, 1509, n. 329 (1987) (\"[T]he non-suspension clause is the original Constitution's most explicit reference to remedies\"). The word \"privilege\" was used, perhaps, to avoid mentioning some rights to the exclusion of others. (Indeed, the only mention of the term \"right\" in the Constitution, as ratified, is in its clause giving Congress the power to protect the rights of authors and inventors. See Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8.)</p>\n<p>Surviving accounts of the ratification debates provide additional evidence that the Framers deemed the writ to be an essential mechanism in the separation-of-powers scheme. In a critical exchange with Patrick Henry at the Virginia ratifying convention Edmund Randolph referred to the Suspension Clause as an \"exception\" to the \"power given to Congress to regulate courts.\" See 3 Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 460-464 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876) (hereinafter Elliot's Debates). A resolution passed by the New York ratifying convention made clear its understanding that the Clause not only protects against arbitrary suspensions of the writ but also guarantees an affirmative right to judicial inquiry into the causes of detention. See Resolution of the New York Ratifying Convention (July 26, 1788), in 1 Elliot's Debates 328 (noting the convention's understanding \"[t]hat every person restrained of his liberty is entitled to an inquiry into the lawfulness of such restraint, and to a removal thereof if unlawful; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2247</span> and that such inquiry or removal ought not to be denied or delayed, except when, on account of public danger, the Congress shall suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>\"). Alexander Hamilton likewise explained that by providing the detainee a judicial forum to challenge detention, the writ preserves limited government. As he explained in The Federalist No. 84:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny. The observations of the judicious Blackstone ... are well worthy of recital: `To bereave a man of life ... or by violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a <i>more dangerous engine</i> of arbitrary government.' And as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the <i>habeas corpus</i> act, which in one place he calls `the BULWARK of the British Constitution.'\" C. Rossiter ed., p. 512 (1961) (quoting 1 Blackstone *136, 4 <i>id.,</i> at *438).</blockquote>\n<p>Post-1789 habeas developments in England, though not bearing upon the Framers' intent, do verify their foresight. Those later events would underscore the need for structural barriers against arbitrary suspensions of the writ. Just as the writ had been vulnerable to executive and parliamentary encroachment on both sides of the Atlantic before the American Revolution, despite the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, the writ was suspended with frequency in England during times of political unrest after 1789. Parliament suspended the writ for much of the period from 1792 to 1801, resulting in rampant arbitrary imprisonment. See Hall &amp; Albion 550. Even as late as World War I, at least one prominent English jurist complained that the Defence of the Realm Act, 1914, 4 &amp; 5 Geo. 5, ch. 29(1)(a), effectively had suspended the privilege of habeas corpus for any person suspected of \"communicating with the enemy.\" See <i>King v. Halliday,</i> [1917] A.C. 260, 299 (Lord Shaw, dissenting); see generally A. Simpson, In the Highest Degree Odious: Detention Without Trial in Wartime Britain 6-7, 24-25 (1992).</p>\n<p>In our own system the Suspension Clause is designed to protect against these cyclical abuses. The Clause protects the rights of the detained by a means consistent with the essential design of the Constitution. It ensures that, except during periods of formal suspension, the Judiciary will have a time-tested device, the writ, to maintain the \"delicate balance of governance\" that is itself the surest safeguard of liberty. See <i>Hamdi,</i> 542 U.S., at 536, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (plurality opinion). The Clause protects the rights of the detained by affirming the duty and authority of the Judiciary to call the jailer to account. See <i>Preiser v. Rodriguez,</i> 411 U.S. 475, 484, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (\"[T]he essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of that custody\"); cf. <i>In re Jackson,</i> 15 Mich. 417, 439-440 (1867) (Cooley, J., concurring) (\"The important fact to be observed in regard to the mode of procedure upon this [habeas] writ is, that it is directed to, and served upon, not the person confined, but his jailer\"). The separation-of-powers doctrine, and the history that influenced its design, therefore must inform the reach and purpose of the Suspension Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2248</span> B</h2>\n<p>The broad historical narrative of the writ and its function is central to our analysis, but we seek guidance as well from founding-era authorities addressing the specific question before us: whether foreign nationals, apprehended and detained in distant countries during a time of serious threats to our Nation's security, may assert the privilege of the writ and seek its protection. The Court has been careful not to foreclose the possibility that the protections of the Suspension Clause have expanded along with post-1789 developments that define the present scope of the writ. See <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 300-301, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). But the analysis may begin with precedents as of 1789, for the Court has said that \"at the absolute minimum\" the Clause protects the writ as it existed when the Constitution was drafted and ratified. <i>Id.,</i> at 301, 121 S.Ct. 2271.</p>\n<p>To support their arguments, the parties in these cases have examined historical sources to construct a view of the commonlaw writ as it existed in 1789\u0097as have <i>amici</i> whose expertise in legal history the Court has relied upon in the past. See Brief for Legal Historians as <i>Amici Curiae;</i> see also <i>St. Cyr, supra,</i> at 302, n. 16, 121 S.Ct. 2271. The Government argues the common-law writ ran only to those territories over which the Crown was sovereign. See Brief for Respondents 27. Petitioners argue that jurisdiction followed the King's officers. See Brief for Petitioner Boumediene et al. 11. Diligent search by all parties reveals no certain conclusions. In none of the cases cited do we find that a common-law court would or would not have granted, or refused to hear for lack of jurisdiction, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought by a prisoner deemed an enemy combatant, under a standard like the one the Department of Defense has used in these cases, and when held in a territory, like Guantanamo, over which the Government has total military and civil control.</p>\n<p>We know that at common law a petitioner's status as an alien was not a categorical bar to habeas corpus relief. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Sommersett's Case,</i> 20 How. St. Tr. 1, 80-82 (1772) (ordering an African slave freed upon finding the custodian's return insufficient); see generally <i>Khera v. Secretary of State for the Home Dept.,</i> [1984] A.C. 74, 111 (\"Habeas corpus protection is often expressed as limited to `British subjects.' Is it really limited to British nationals? Suffice it to say that the case law has given an emphatic `no' to the question\"). We know as well that common-law courts entertained habeas petitions brought by enemy aliens detained in England\u0097\"entertained\" at least in the sense that the courts held hearings to determine the threshold question of entitlement to the writ. See <i>Case of Three Spanish Sailors,</i> 2 Black. W. 1324, 96 Eng. Rep. 775 (C.P. 1779); <i>King v. Schiever,</i> 2 Burr. 765, 97 Eng. Rep. 551 (K.B.1759); <i>Du Castro's Case,</i> Fort. 195, 92 Eng. Rep. 816 (K.B.1697).</p>\n<p>In <i>Schiever</i> and the <i>Spanish Sailors</i>' case, the courts denied relief to the petitioners. Whether the holdings in these cases were jurisdictional or based upon the courts' ruling that the petitioners were detained lawfully as prisoners of war is unclear. See <i>Spanish Sailors, supra,</i> at 1324, 96 Eng. Rep., at 776; <i>Schiever, supra,</i> at 766, 97 Eng. Rep., at 552. In <i>Du Castro</i>'s <i>Case,</i> the court granted relief, but that case is not analogous to petitioners' because the prisoner there appears to have been detained in England. See Halliday &amp; White 27, n. 72. To the extent these authorities suggest the common-law courts abstained altogether from matters involving prisoners of war, there was greater justification for doing so in the context of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2249</span> declared wars with other nation states. Judicial intervention might have complicated the military's ability to negotiate exchange of prisoners with the enemy, a wartime practice well known to the Framers. See Resolution of Mar. 30, 1778, 10 Journals of the Continental Congress 1774-1789, p. 295 (W. Ford ed.1908) (directing General Washington not to exchange prisoners with the British unless the enemy agreed to exempt citizens from capture).</p>\n<p>We find the evidence as to the geographic scope of the writ at common law informative, but, again, not dispositive. Petitioners argue the site of their detention is analogous to two territories outside of England to which the writ did run: the so-called \"exempt jurisdictions,\" like the Channel Islands; and (in former times) India. There are critical differences between these places and Guantanamo, however.</p>\n<p>As the Court noted in <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 481-482, and nn. 11-12, 124 S.Ct. 2686, common-law courts granted habeas corpus relief to prisoners detained in the exempt jurisdictions. But these areas, while not in theory part of the realm of England, were nonetheless under the Crown's control. See 2 H. Hallam, Constitutional History of England: From the Accession of Henry VII to the Death of George II, pp. 232-233 (reprint 1989). And there is some indication that these jurisdictions were considered sovereign territory. <i>King v. Cowle,</i> 2 Burr. 834, 854, 855, 97 Eng. Rep. 587, 599 (K.B.1759) (describing one of the exempt jurisdictions, Berwick-upon-Tweed, as under the \"sovereign jurisdiction\" and \"subjection of the Crown of England\"). Because the United States does not maintain formal sovereignty over Guantanamo Bay, see Part IV, <i>infra,</i> the naval station there and the exempt jurisdictions discussed in the English authorities are not similarly situated.</p>\n<p>Petitioners and their <i>amici</i> further rely on cases in which British courts in India granted writs of habeas corpus to noncitizens detained in territory over which the Moghul Emperor retained formal sovereignty and control. See <i>supra,</i> at 2246-2248; Brief for Legal Historians as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 12-13. The analogy to the present cases breaks down, however, because of the geographic location of the courts in the Indian example. The Supreme Court of Judicature (the British Court) sat in Calcutta; but no federal court sits at Guantanamo. The Supreme Court of Judicature was, moreover, a special court set up by Parliament to monitor certain conduct during the British Raj. See Regulating Act of 1773, 13 Geo. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 13-14. That it had the power to issue the writ in nonsovereign territory does not prove that common-law courts sitting in England had the same power. If petitioners were to have the better of the argument on this point, we would need some demonstration of a consistent practice of common-law courts sitting in England and entertaining petitions brought by alien prisoners detained abroad. We find little support for this conclusion.</p>\n<p>The Government argues, in turn, that Guantanamo is more closely analogous to Scotland and Hanover, territories that were not part of England but nonetheless controlled by the English monarch (in his separate capacities as King of Scotland and Elector of Hanover). See <i>Cowle,</i> 2 Burr., at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 600. Lord Mansfield can be cited for the proposition that, at the time of the founding, English courts lacked the \"power\" to issue the writ to Scotland and Hanover, territories Lord Mansfield referred to as \"foreign.\" <i>Ibid.</i> But what matters for our purposes is why common-law courts lacked this power. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2250</span> Given the English Crown's delicate and complicated relationships with Scotland and Hanover in the 1700's, we cannot disregard the possibility that the common-law courts' refusal to issue the writ to these places was motivated not by formal legal constructs but by what we would think of as prudential concerns. This appears to have been the case with regard to other British territories where the writ did not run. See 2 R. Chambers, A Course of Lectures on English Law 1767-1773, p. 8 (T. Curley ed.1986) (quoting the view of Lord Mansfield in <i>Cowle</i> that \"[n]otwithstanding the <i>power</i> which the judges have, yet where they cannot judge of the cause, or give relief upon it, they would not think <i>proper</i> to interpose; and therefore in the case of imprisonments in <i>Guernsey, Jersey, Minorca,</i> or the <i>plantations,</i> the most usual way is to complain to the <i>king in Council</i>\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). And after the Act of Union in 1707, through which the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged politically, Queen Anne and her successors, in their new capacity as sovereign of Great Britain, ruled the entire island as one kingdom. Accordingly, by the time Lord Mansfield penned his opinion in <i>Cowle</i> in 1759, Scotland was no longer a \"foreign\" country vis-\u00e1-vis England\u0097at least not in the sense in which Cuba is a foreign country vis-\u00e1-vis the United States.</p>\n<p>Scotland remained \"foreign\" in Lord Mansfield's day in at least one important respect, however. Even after the Act of Union, Scotland (like Hanover) continued to maintain its own laws and court system. See 1 Blackstone *98, *109. Under these circumstances prudential considerations would have weighed heavily when courts sitting in England received habeas petitions from Scotland or the Electorate. Common-law decisions withholding the writ from prisoners detained in these places easily could be explained as efforts to avoid either or both of two embarrassments: conflict with the judgments of another court of competent jurisdiction; or the practical inability, by reason of distance, of the English courts to enforce their judgments outside their territorial jurisdiction. Cf. <i>Munaf v. Geren,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2207, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 2008 WL 2369260 *13-14 (opinion of the Court) (recognizing that \"`prudential concerns' ... such as comity and the orderly administration of criminal justice\" affect the appropriate exercise of habeas jurisdiction).</p>\n<p>By the mid-19th century, British courts could issue the writ to Canada, notwithstanding the fact that Canadian courts also had the power to do so. See 9 Holdsworth 124 (citing <i>Ex parte Anderson,</i> 3 El. and El. 487 (1861)). This might be seen as evidence that the existence of a separate court system was no barrier to the running of the common-law writ. The Canada of the 1800's, however, was in many respects more analogous to the exempt jurisdictions or to Ireland, where the writ ran, than to Scotland or Hanover in the 1700's, where it did not. Unlike Scotland and Hanover, Canada followed English law. See B. Laskin, The British Tradition in Canadian Law 50-51 (1969).</p>\n<p>In the end a categorical or formal conception of sovereignty does not provide a comprehensive or altogether satisfactory explanation for the general understanding that prevailed when Lord Mansfield considered issuance of the writ outside England. In 1759 the writ did not run to Scotland but did run to Ireland, even though, at that point, Scotland and England had merged under the rule of a single sovereign, whereas the Crowns of Great Britain and Ireland remained separate (at least in theory). See <i>Cowle, supra,</i> at 856-857, 97 Eng. Rep., 600; 1 Blackstone *100-101. But there was at least one major <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2251</span> difference between Scotland's and Ireland's relationship with England during this period that might explain why the writ ran to Ireland but not to Scotland. English law did not generally apply in Scotland (even after the Act of Union) but it did apply in Ireland. Blackstone put it as follows: \"[A]s Scotland and England are now one and the same kingdom, and yet differ in their municipal laws; so England and Ireland are, on the other hand, distinct kingdoms, and yet in general agree in their laws.\" <i>Id.,</i> at *100. This distinction, and not formal notions of sovereignty, may well explain why the writ did not run to Scotland (and Hanover) but would run to Ireland.</p>\n<p>The prudential barriers that may have prevented the English courts from issuing the writ to Scotland and Hanover are not relevant here. We have no reason to believe an order from a federal court would be disobeyed at Guantanamo. No Cuban court has jurisdiction to hear these petitioners' claims, and no law other than the laws of the United States applies at the naval station. The modern-day relations between the United States and Guantanamo thus differ in important respects from the 18th-century relations between England and the kingdoms of Scotland and Hanover. This is reason enough for us to discount the relevance of the Government's analogy.</p>\n<p>Each side in the present matter argues that the very lack of a precedent on point supports its position. The Government points out there is no evidence that a court sitting in England granted habeas relief to an enemy alien detained abroad; petitioners respond there is no evidence that a court refused to do so for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Both arguments are premised, however, upon the assumption that the historical record is complete and that the common law, if properly understood, yields a definite answer to the questions before us. There are reasons to doubt both assumptions. Recent scholarship points to the inherent shortcomings in the historical record. See Halliday &amp; White 14-15 (noting that most reports of 18th-century habeas proceedings were not printed). And given the unique status of Guantanamo Bay and the particular dangers of terrorism in the modern age, the common-law courts simply may not have confronted cases with close parallels to this one. We decline, therefore, to infer too much, one way or the other, from the lack of historical evidence on point. Cf. <i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i> 347 U.S. 483, 489, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (noting evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, discussed in the parties' briefs and uncovered through the Court's own investigation, \"convince us that, although these sources cast some light, it is not enough to resolve the problem with which we are faced. At best, they are inconclusive\"); <i>Reid v. Covert,</i> 354 U.S. 1, 64, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result) (arguing constitutional adjudication should not be based upon evidence that is \"too episodic, too meager, to form a solid basis in history, preceding and contemporaneous with the framing of the Constitution\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Drawing from its position that at common law the writ ran only to territories over which the Crown was sovereign, the Government says the Suspension Clause affords petitioners no rights because the United States does not claim sovereignty over the place of detention.</p>\n<p>Guantanamo Bay is not formally part of the United States. See DTA \u00a7 1005(g), 119 Stat. 2743. And under the terms of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2252</span> the lease between the United States and Cuba, Cuba retains \"ultimate sovereignty\" over the territory while the United States exercises \"complete jurisdiction and control.\" See Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval Stations, Feb. 23, 1903, U.S.-Cuba, Art. III, T.S. No. 418 (hereinafter 1903 Lease Agreement); <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 471, 124 S.Ct. 2686. Under the terms of the 1934 Treaty, however, Cuba effectively has no rights as a sovereign until the parties agree to modification of the 1903 Lease Agreement or the United States abandons the base. See Treaty Defining Relations with Cuba, May 29, 1934, U.S.-Cuba, Art. III, 48 Stat. 1683, T.S. No. 866.</p>\n<p>The United States contends, nevertheless, that Guantanamo is not within its sovereign control. This was the Government's position well before the events of September 11, 2001. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Petitioners in <i>Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc.,</i> O.T.1992, No. 92-344, p. 31 (arguing that Guantanamo is territory \"<i>outside</i> the United States\"). And in other contexts the Court has held that questions of sovereignty are for the political branches to decide. See <i>Vermilya-Brown Co. v. Connell,</i> 335 U.S. 377, 380, 69 S.Ct. 140, 93 L.Ed. 76 (1948) (\"[D]etermination of sovereignty over an area is for the legislative and executive departments\"); see also <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 137 U.S. 202, 11 S.Ct. 80, 34 L.Ed. 691 (1890); <i>Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co.,</i> 13 Pet. 415, 420, 10 L.Ed. 226 (1839). Even if this were a treaty interpretation case that did not involve a political question, the President's construction of the lease agreement would be entitled to great respect. See <i>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano,</i> 457 U.S. 176, 184-185, 102 S.Ct. 2374, 72 L.Ed.2d 765 (1982).</p>\n<p>We therefore do not question the Government's position that Cuba, not the United States, maintains sovereignty, in the legal and technical sense of the term, over Guantanamo Bay. But this does not end the analysis. Our cases do not hold it is improper for us to inquire into the objective degree of control the Nation asserts over foreign territory. As commentators have noted, \"`[s]overeignty' is a term used in many senses and is much abused.\" See 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 206, Comment <i>b,</i> p. 94 (1986). When we have stated that sovereignty is a political question, we have referred not to sovereignty in the general, colloquial sense, meaning the exercise of dominion or power, see Webster's New International Dictionary 2406 (2d ed.1934) (\"sovereignty,\" definition 3), but sovereignty in the narrow, legal sense of the term, meaning a claim of right, see 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 206, Comment <i>b,</i> at 94 (noting that sovereignty \"implies a state's lawful control over its territory generally to the exclusion of other states, authority to govern in that territory, and authority to apply law there\"). Indeed, it is not altogether uncommon for a territory to be under the <i>de jure</i> sovereignty of one nation, while under the plenary control, or practical sovereignty, of another. This condition can occur when the territory is seized during war, as Guantanamo was during the Spanish-American War. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Fleming v. Page,</i> 9 How. 603, 614, 13 L.Ed. 276 (1850) (noting that the port of Tampico, conquered by the United States during the war with Mexico, was \"undoubtedly ... subject to the sovereignty and dominion of the United States,\" but that it \"does not follow that it was a part of the United States, or that it ceased to be a foreign country\"); <i>King v. Earl of Crewe ex parte Sekgome,</i> [1910] 2 K.B. 576, 603-604 (C.A.) (opinion of Williams, L.J.) (arguing that the Bechuanaland Protectorate in South Africa was \"under His Majesty's dominion in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2253</span> sense of power and jurisdiction, but is not under his dominion in the sense of territorial dominion\"). Accordingly, for purposes of our analysis, we accept the Government's position that Cuba, and not the United States, retains <i>de jure</i> sovereignty over Guantanamo Bay. As we did in <i>Rasul,</i> however, we take notice of the obvious and uncontested fact that the United States, by virtue of its complete jurisdiction and control over the base, maintains <i>de facto</i> sovereignty over this territory. See 542 U.S., at 480, 124 S.Ct. 2686; <i>id.,</i> at 487, 124 S.Ct. 2686 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>Were we to hold that the present cases turn on the political question doctrine, we would be required first to accept the Government's premise that <i>de jure</i> sovereignty is the touchstone of habeas corpus jurisdiction. This premise, however, is unfounded. For the reasons indicated above, the history of common-law habeas corpus provides scant support for this proposition; and, for the reasons indicated below, that position would be inconsistent with our precedents and contrary to fundamental separation-of-powers principles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Court has discussed the issue of the Constitution's extraterritorial application on many occasions. These decisions undermine the Government's argument that, at least as applied to noncitizens, the Constitution necessarily stops where <i>de jure</i> sovereignty ends.</p>\n<p>The Framers foresaw that the United States would expand and acquire new territories. See <i>American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton,</i> 1 Pet. 511, 542, 7 L.Ed. 242 (1828). Article IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 1, grants Congress the power to admit new States. Clause 2 of the same section grants Congress the \"Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.\" Save for a few notable (and notorious) exceptions, <i>e.g., </i><i>Dred Scott v. Sandford,</i> 19 How. 393, 15 L.Ed. 691 (1857), throughout most of our history there was little need to explore the outer boundaries of the Constitution's geographic reach. When Congress exercised its power to create new territories, it guaranteed constitutional protections to the inhabitants by statute. See, <i>e.g.,</i> An Act: to establish a Territorial Government for Utah, 9 Stat. 458 (\"[T]he Constitution and laws of the United States are hereby extended over and declared to be in force in said Territory of Utah\"); Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1891 (\"The Constitution and all laws of the United States which are not locally inapplicable shall have the same force and effect within all the organized Territories, and in every Territory hereafter organized as elsewhere within the United States\"); see generally Burnett, <i>Untied</i> States: American Expansion and Territorial Deannexation, 72 U. Chi. L.Rev. 797, 825-827 (2005). In particular, there was no need to test the limits of the Suspension Clause because, as early as 1789, Congress extended the writ to the Territories. See Act of Aug. 7, 1789, 1 Stat. 52 (reaffirming Art. II of Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which provided that \"[t]he inhabitants of the said territory, shall always be entitled to the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus\").</p>\n<p>Fundamental questions regarding the Constitution's geographic scope first arose at the dawn of the 20th century when the Nation acquired noncontiguous Territories: Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines\u0097 ceded to the United States by Spain at the conclusion of the Spanish-American War\u0097 and Hawaii\u0097annexed by the United States in 1898. At this point Congress chose to discontinue its previous practice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2254</span> of extending constitutional rights to the territories by statute. See, <i>e.g.,</i> An Act Temporarily to provide for the administration of the affairs of civil government in the Philippine Islands, and for other purposes, 32 Stat. 692 (noting that Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1891 did not apply to the Philippines).</p>\n<p>In a series of opinions later known as the Insular Cases, the Court addressed whether the Constitution, by its own force, applies in any territory that is not a State. See <i>De Lima v. Bidwell,</i> 182 U.S. 1, 21 S.Ct. 743, 45 L.Ed. 1041 (1901); <i>Dooley v. United States,</i> 182 U.S. 222, 21 S.Ct. 762, 45 L.Ed. 1074 (1901); <i>Armstrong v. United States,</i> 182 U.S. 243, 21 S.Ct. 827, 45 L.Ed. 1086 (1901); <i>Downes v. Bidwell,</i> 182 U.S. 244, 21 S.Ct. 770, 45 L.Ed. 1088 (1901); <i>Hawaii v. Mankichi,</i> 190 U.S. 197, 23 S.Ct. 787, 47 L.Ed. 1016 (1903); <i>Dorr v. United States,</i> 195 U.S. 138, 24 S.Ct. 808, 49 L.Ed. 128 (1904). The Court held that the Constitution has independent force in these territories, a force not contingent upon acts of legislative grace. Yet it took note of the difficulties inherent in that position.</p>\n<p>Prior to their cession to the United States, the former Spanish colonies operated under a civil-law system, without experience in the various aspects of the Anglo-American legal tradition, for instance the use of grand and petit juries. At least with regard to the Philippines, a complete transformation of the prevailing legal culture would have been not only disruptive but also unnecessary, as the United States intended to grant independence to that Territory. See An Act To declare the purpose of the people of the United States as to the future political status of the people of the Philippine Islands, and to provide a more autonomous government for those islands (Jones Act), 39 Stat. 545 (noting that \"it was never the intention of the people of the United States in the incipiency of the War with Spain to make it a war of conquest or for territorial aggrandizement\" and that \"it is, as it has always been, the purpose of the people of the United States to withdraw their sovereignty over the Philippine Islands and to recognize their independence as soon as a stable government can be established therein\"). The Court thus was reluctant to risk the uncertainty and instability that could result from a rule that displaced altogether the existing legal systems in these newly acquired Territories. See <i>Downes, supra,</i> at 282, 21 S.Ct. 770 (\"It is obvious that in the annexation of outlying and distant possessions grave questions will arise from differences of race, habits, laws and customs of the people, and from differences of soil, climate and production...\").</p>\n<p>These considerations resulted in the doctrine of territorial incorporation, under which the Constitution applies in full in incorporated Territories surely destined for statehood but only in part in unincorporated Territories. See <i>Dorr, supra,</i> at 143, 24 S.Ct. 808 (\"Until Congress shall see fit to incorporate territory ceded by treaty into the United States, ... the territory is to be governed under the power existing in Congress to make laws for such territories and subject to such constitutional restrictions upon the powers of that body as are applicable to the situation\"); <i>Downes, supra,</i> at 293, 21 S.Ct. 770 (White, J., concurring) (\"[T]he determination of what particular provision of the Constitution is applicable, generally speaking, in all cases, involves an inquiry into the situation of the territory and its relations to the United States\"). As the Court later made clear, \"the real issue in the <i>Insular Cases</i> was not whether the Constitution extended to the Philippines or Porto Rico when we went there, but which of its provisions were applicable by way of limitation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2255</span> upon the exercise of executive and legislative power in dealing with new conditions and requirements.\" <i>Balzac v. Porto Rico,</i> 258 U.S. 298, 312, 42 S.Ct. 343, 66 L.Ed. 627 (1922). It may well be that over time the ties between the United States and any of its unincorporated Territories strengthen in ways that are of constitutional significance. Cf. <i>Torres v. Puerto Rico,</i> 442 U.S. 465, 475-476, 99 S.Ct. 2425, 61 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (\"Whatever the validity of the [Insular Cases] in the particular historical context in which they were decided, those cases are clearly not authority for questioning the application of the Fourth Amendment\u0097or any other provision of the Bill of Rights\u0097to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in the 1970's\"). But, as early as <i>Balzac</i> in 1922, the Court took for granted that even in unincorporated Territories the Government of the United States was bound to provide to noncitizen inhabitants \"guaranties of certain fundamental personal rights declared in the Constitution.\" 258 U.S., at 312, 42 S.Ct. 343; see also <i>Late Corp. of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States,</i> 136 U.S. 1, 44, 10 S.Ct. 792, 34 L.Ed. 478 (1890) (\"Doubtless Congress, in legislating for the Territories would be subject to those fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights which are formulated in the Constitution and its amendments\"). Yet noting the inherent practical difficulties of enforcing all constitutional provisions \"always and everywhere,\" <i>Balzac, supra,</i> at 312, 42 S.Ct. 343, the Court devised in the Insular Cases a doctrine that allowed it to use its power sparingly and where it would be most needed. This century-old doctrine informs our analysis in the present matter.</p>\n<p>Practical considerations likewise influenced the Court's analysis a half-century later in <i>Reid,</i> 354 U.S. 1, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148. The petitioners there, spouses of American servicemen, lived on American military bases in England and Japan. They were charged with crimes committed in those countries and tried before military courts, consistent with executive agreements the United States had entered into with the British and Japanese governments. <i>Id.,</i> at 15-16, and nn. 29-30, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (plurality opinion). Because the petitioners were not themselves military personnel, they argued they were entitled to trial by jury.</p>\n<p>Justice Black, writing for the plurality, contrasted the cases before him with the Insular Cases, which involved territories \"with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions\" that Congress intended to govern only \"temporarily.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 14, 77 S.Ct. 1222. Justice Frankfurter argued that the \"specific circumstances of each particular case\" are relevant in determining the geographic scope of the Constitution. <i>Id.,</i> at 54, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (opinion concurring in result). And Justice Harlan, who had joined an opinion reaching the opposite result in the case in the previous Term, <i>Reid v. Covert,</i> 351 U.S. 487, 76 S.Ct. 880, 100 L.Ed. 1352 (1956), was most explicit in rejecting a \"rigid and abstract rule\" for determining where constitutional guarantees extend. <i>Reid,</i> 354 U.S., at 74, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (opinion concurring in result). He read the Insular Cases to teach that whether a constitutional provision has extraterritorial effect depends upon the \"particular circumstances, the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives which Congress had before it\" and, in particular, whether judicial enforcement of the provision would be \"impracticable and anomalous.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 74-75, 77 S.Ct. 1222; see also <i>United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez,</i> 494 U.S. 259, 277-278, 110 S.Ct. 1056, 108 L.Ed.2d 222 (1990) (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (applying the \"impracticable and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2256</span> anomalous\" extraterritoriality test in the Fourth Amendment context).</p>\n<p>That the petitioners in <i>Reid</i> were American citizens was a key factor in the case and was central to the plurality's conclusion that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments apply to American civilians tried outside the United States. But practical considerations, related not to the petitioners' citizenship but to the place of their confinement and trial, were relevant to each Member of the <i>Reid</i> majority. And to Justices Harlan and Frankfurter (whose votes were necessary to the Court's disposition) these considerations were the decisive factors in the case.</p>\n<p>Indeed the majority splintered on this very point. The key disagreement between the plurality and the concurring Justices in <i>Reid</i> was over the continued precedential value of the Court's previous opinion in <i>In re Ross,</i> 140 U.S. 453, 11 S.Ct. 897, 35 L.Ed. 581 (1891), which the <i>Reid</i> Court understood as holding that under some circumstances Americans abroad have no right to indictment and trial by jury. The petitioner in <i>Ross</i> was a sailor serving on an American merchant vessel in Japanese waters who was tried before an American consular tribunal for the murder of a fellow crewman. 140 U.S., at 459, 479, 11 S.Ct. 897. The <i>Ross</i> Court held that the petitioner, who was a British subject, had no rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. <i>Id.,</i> at 464, 11 S.Ct. 897. The petitioner's citizenship played no role in the disposition of the case, however. The Court assumed (consistent with the maritime custom of the time) that Ross had all the rights of a similarly situated American citizen. <i>Id.,</i> at 479, 11 S.Ct. 897 (noting that Ross was \"under the protection and subject to the laws of the United States equally with the seaman who was native born\"). The Justices in <i>Reid</i> therefore properly understood <i>Ross</i> as standing for the proposition that, at least in some circumstances, the jury provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments have no application to American citizens tried by American authorities abroad. See 354 U.S., at 11-12, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (plurality opinion) (describing <i>Ross</i> as holding that \"constitutional protections applied `only to citizens and others within the United States ... and not to residents or temporary sojourners abroad'\" (quoting <i>Ross, supra,</i> at 464, 11 S.Ct. 897)); 354 U.S., at 64, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result) (noting that the consular tribunals upheld in <i>Ross</i> \"w[ere] based on long-established custom and they were justified as the best possible means for securing justice for the few Americans present in [foreign] countries\"); 354 U.S., at 75, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Harlan, J., concurring in result) (\"what <i>Ross</i> and the <i>Insular Cases</i> hold is that the particular local setting, the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives are relevant to a question of judgment, namely, whether jury trial <i>should</i> be deemed a necessary condition of the exercise of Congress' power to provide for the trial of Americans overseas\").</p>\n<p>The <i>Reid</i> plurality doubted that <i>Ross</i> was rightly decided, precisely because it believed the opinion was insufficiently protective of the rights of American citizens. See 354 U.S., at 10-12, 77 S.Ct. 1222; see also <i>id.,</i> at 78, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Clark, J., dissenting) (noting that \"four of my brothers would specifically overrule and two would impair the long-recognized vitality of an old and respected precedent in our law, the case of <i>In re Ross,</i> 140 U.S. 453, 11 S.Ct. 897, 35 L.Ed. 581 (1891)\"). But Justices Harlan and Frankfurter, while willing to hold that the American citizen petitioners in the cases before them were entitled to the protections of Fifth and Sixth Amendments, were unwilling to overturn <i>Ross.</i> 354 U.S., at 64, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2257</span> <i>id.,</i> at 75, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Instead, the two concurring Justices distinguished <i>Ross</i> from the cases before them, not on the basis of the citizenship of the petitioners, but on practical considerations that made jury trial a more feasible option for them than it was for the petitioner in <i>Ross.</i> If citizenship had been the only relevant factor in the case, it would have been necessary for the Court to overturn <i>Ross,</i> something Justices Harlan and Frankfurter were unwilling to do. See <i>Verdugo-Urquidez, supra,</i> at 277, 110 S.Ct. 1056 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (noting that <i>Ross</i> had not been overruled).</p>\n<p>Practical considerations weighed heavily as well in <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager,</i> 339 U.S. 763, 70 S.Ct. 936, 94 L.Ed. 1255 (1950), where the Court addressed whether habeas corpus jurisdiction extended to enemy aliens who had been convicted of violating the laws of war. The prisoners were detained at Landsberg Prison in Germany during the Allied Powers' postwar occupation. The Court stressed the difficulties of ordering the Government to produce the prisoners in a habeas corpus proceeding. It \"would require allocation of shipping space, guarding personnel, billeting and rations\" and would damage the prestige of military commanders at a sensitive time. <i>Id.,</i> at 779, 70 S.Ct. 936. In considering these factors the Court sought to balance the constraints of military occupation with constitutional necessities. <i>Id.,</i> at 769-779, 70 S.Ct. 936; see <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 475-476, 124 S.Ct. 2686 (discussing the factors relevant to <i>Eisentrager</i>'s constitutional holding); 542 U.S., at 486, 124 S.Ct. 2686 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (same).</p>\n<p>True, the Court in <i>Eisentrager</i> denied access to the writ, and it noted the prisoners \"at no relevant time were within any territory over which the United States is sovereign, and [that] the scenes of their offense, their capture, their trial and their punishment were all beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.\" 339 U.S., at 778, 70 S.Ct. 936. The Government seizes upon this language as proof positive that the <i>Eisentrager</i> Court adopted a formalistic, sovereignty-based test for determining the reach of the Suspension Clause. See Brief for Respondents 18-20. We reject this reading for three reasons.</p>\n<p>First, we do not accept the idea that the above-quoted passage from <i>Eisentrager</i> is the only authoritative language in the opinion and that all the rest is dicta. The Court's further determinations, based on practical considerations, were integral to Part II of its opinion and came before the decision announced its holding. See 339 U.S., at 781, 70 S.Ct. 936.</p>\n<p>Second, because the United States lacked both <i>de jure</i> sovereignty and plenary control over Landsberg Prison, see <i>infra,</i> at 2258-2259, it is far from clear that the <i>Eisentrager</i> Court used the term sovereignty only in the narrow technical sense and not to connote the degree of control the military asserted over the facility. See <i>supra,</i> at 2250-2251. The Justices who decided <i>Eisentrager</i> would have understood sovereignty as a multifaceted concept. See Black's Law Dictionary 1568 (4th ed.1951) (defining \"sovereignty\" as \"[t]he supreme, absolute, and uncontrollable power by which any independent state is governed\"; \"the international independence of a state, combined with the right and power of regulating its internal affairs without foreign dictation\"; and \"[t]he power to do everything in a state without accountability\"); Ballentine's Law Dictionary with Pronunciations 1216 (2d ed.1948) (defining \"sovereignty\" as \"[t]hat public authority which commands in civil society, and orders and directs what each citizen is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2258</span> to perform to obtain the end of its institution\"). In its principal brief in <i>Eisentrager,</i> the Government advocated a bright-line test for determining the scope of the writ, similar to the one it advocates in these cases. See Brief for Petitioners in <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager</i><i>,</i> O.T.1949, No. 306, pp. 74-75. Yet the Court mentioned the concept of territorial sovereignty only twice in its opinion. See <i>Eisentrager, supra,</i> at 778, 780, 70 S.Ct. 936. That the Court devoted a significant portion of Part II to a discussion of practical barriers to the running of the writ suggests that the Court was not concerned exclusively with the formal legal status of Landsberg Prison but also with the objective degree of control the United States asserted over it. Even if we assume the <i>Eisentrager</i> Court considered the United States' lack of formal legal sovereignty over Landsberg Prison as the decisive factor in that case, its holding is not inconsistent with a functional approach to questions of extraterritoriality. The formal legal status of a given territory affects, at least to some extent, the political branches' control over that territory. <i>De jure</i> sovereignty is a factor that bears upon which constitutional guarantees apply there.</p>\n<p>Third, if the Government's reading of <i>Eisentrager</i> were correct, the opinion would have marked not only a change in, but a complete repudiation of, the Insular Cases' (and later <i>Reid</i>'s) functional approach to questions of extraterritoriality. We cannot accept the Government's view. Nothing in <i>Eisentrager</i> says that <i>de jure</i> sovereignty is or has ever been the only relevant consideration in determining the geographic reach of the Constitution or of habeas corpus. Were that the case, there would be considerable tension between <i>Eisentrager,</i> on the one hand, and the Insular Cases and <i>Reid,</i> on the other. Our cases need not be read to conflict in this manner. A constricted reading of <i>Eisentrager</i> overlooks what we see as a common thread uniting the Insular Cases, <i>Eisentrager,</i> and <i>Reid:</i> the idea that questions of extraterritoriality turn on objective factors and practical concerns, not formalism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Government's formal sovereignty-based test raises troubling separation-of-powers concerns as well. The political history of Guantanamo illustrates the deficiencies of this approach. The United States has maintained complete and uninterrupted control of the bay for over 100 years. At the close of the Spanish-American War, Spain ceded control over the entire island of Cuba to the United States and specifically \"relinquishe[d] all claim[s] of sovereignty ... and title.\" See Treaty of Paris, Dec. 10, 1898, U.S.-Spain, Art. I, 30 Stat. 1755, T.S. No. 343. From the date the treaty with Spain was signed until the Cuban Republic was established on May 20, 1902, the United States governed the territory \"in trust\" for the benefit of the Cuban people. <i>Neely v. Henkel,</i> 180 U.S. 109, 120, 21 S.Ct. 302, 45 L.Ed. 448 (1901); H. Thomas, Cuba or The Pursuit of Freedom 436, 460 (1998). And although it recognized, by entering into the 1903 Lease Agreement, that Cuba retained \"ultimate sovereignty\" over Guantanamo, the United States continued to maintain the same plenary control it had enjoyed since 1898. Yet the Government's view is that the Constitution had no effect there, at least as to noncitizens, because the United States disclaimed sovereignty in the formal sense of the term. The necessary implication of the argument is that by surrendering formal sovereignty over any unincorporated territory to a third party, while at the same time entering into a lease that grants total control over the territory back to the United States, it would be possible for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2259</span> political branches to govern without legal constraint.</p>\n<p>Our basic charter cannot be contracted away like this. The Constitution grants Congress and the President the power to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its terms apply. Even when the United States acts outside its borders, its powers are not \"absolute and unlimited\" but are subject \"to such restrictions as are expressed in the Constitution.\" <i>Murphy v. Ramsey,</i> 114 U.S. 15, 44, 5 S.Ct. 747, 29 L.Ed. 47 (1885). Abstaining from questions involving formal sovereignty and territorial governance is one thing. To hold the political branches have the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will is quite another. The former position reflects this Court's recognition that certain matters requiring political judgments are best left to the political branches. The latter would permit a striking anomaly in our tripartite system of government, leading to a regime in which Congress and the President, not this Court, say \"what the law is.\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).</p>\n<p>These concerns have particular bearing upon the Suspension Clause question in the cases now before us, for the writ of habeas corpus is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers. The test for determining the scope of this provision must not be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to restrain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>As we recognized in <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 476, 124 S.Ct. 2686; <i>id.,</i> at 487, 124 S.Ct. 2686 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment), the outlines of a framework for determining the reach of the Suspension Clause are suggested by the factors the Court relied upon in <i>Eisentrager.</i> In addition to the practical concerns discussed above, the <i>Eisentrager</i> Court found relevant that each petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) is an enemy alien; (b) has never been or resided in the United States; (c) was captured outside of our territory and there held in military custody as a prisoner of war; (d) was tried and convicted by a Military Commission sitting outside the United States; (e) for offenses against laws of war committed outside the United States; (f) and is at all times imprisoned outside the United States.\" 339 U.S., at 777, 70 S.Ct. 936.</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this language from <i>Eisentrager,</i> and the reasoning in our other extraterritoriality opinions, we conclude that at least three factors are relevant in determining the reach of the Suspension Clause: (1) the citizenship and status of the detainee and the adequacy of the process through which that status determination was made; (2) the nature of the sites where apprehension and then detention took place; and (3) the practical obstacles inherent in resolving the prisoner's entitlement to the writ.</p>\n<p>Applying this framework, we note at the onset that the status of these detainees is a matter of dispute. The petitioners, like those in <i>Eisentrager,</i> are not American citizens. But the petitioners in <i>Eisentrager</i> did not contest, it seems, the Court's assertion that they were \"enemy alien[s].\" <i>Ibid.</i> In the instant cases, by contrast, the detainees deny they are enemy combatants. They have been afforded some process in CSRT proceedings to determine their status; but, unlike in <i>Eisentrager, supra,</i> at 766, 70 S.Ct. 936, there has been no trial by military commission for violations of the laws of war. The difference is not trivial. The records from the <i>Eisentrager</i> trials suggest that, well before the petitioners brought their case to this Court, there had been a rigorous adversarial process to test the legality of their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2260</span> detention. The <i>Eisentrager</i> petitioners were charged by a bill of particulars that made detailed factual allegations against them. See 14 United Nations War Crimes Commission, Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals 8-10 (1949) (reprint 1997). To rebut the accusations, they were entitled to representation by counsel, allowed to introduce evidence on their own behalf, and permitted to cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses. See Memorandum by Command of Lt. Gen. Wedemeyer, Jan. 21, 1946 (establishing \"Regulations Governing the Trial of War Criminals\" in the China Theater), in Tr. of Record in <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager</i><i>,</i> O.T.1949, No. 306, pp. 34-40.</p>\n<p>In comparison the procedural protections afforded to the detainees in the CSRT hearings are far more limited, and, we conclude, fall well short of the procedures and adversarial mechanisms that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review. Although the detainee is assigned a \"Personal Representative\" to assist him during CSRT proceedings, the Secretary of the Navy's memorandum makes clear that person is not the detainee's lawyer or even his \"advocate.\" See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, at 155, 172. The Government's evidence is accorded a presumption of validity. <i>Id.,</i> at 159. The detainee is allowed to present \"reasonably available\" evidence, <i>id.,</i> at 155, but his ability to rebut the Government's evidence against him is limited by the circumstances of his confinement and his lack of counsel at this stage. And although the detainee can seek review of his status determination in the Court of Appeals, that review process cannot cure all defects in the earlier proceedings. See Part V, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>As to the second factor relevant to this analysis, the detainees here are similarly situated to the <i>Eisentrager</i> petitioners in that the sites of their apprehension and detention are technically outside the sovereign territory of the United States. As noted earlier, this is a factor that weighs against finding they have rights under the Suspension Clause. But there are critical differences between Landsberg Prison, circa 1950, and the United States Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay in 2008. Unlike its present control over the naval station, the United States' control over the prison in Germany was neither absolute nor indefinite. Like all parts of occupied Germany, the prison was under the jurisdiction of the combined Allied Forces. See Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority with Respect to Germany, June 5, 1945, U.S.-U.S.S. R.-U. K.-Fr., 60 Stat. 1649, T.I.A.S. No. 1520. The United States was therefore answerable to its Allies for all activities occurring there. Cf. <i>Hirota v. MacArthur,</i> 338 U.S. 197, 198, 69 S.Ct. 197, 93 L.Ed. 1902 (1948) <i>(per curiam)</i> (military tribunal set up by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, acting as \"the agent of the Allied Powers,\" was not a \"tribunal of the United States\"). The Allies had not planned a long-term occupation of Germany, nor did they intend to displace all German institutions even during the period of occupation. See Agreements Respecting Basic Principles for Merger of the Three Western German Zones of Occupation, and Other Matters, Apr. 8, 1949, U.S.-U. K.-Fr., Art. 1, 63 Stat. 2819, T.I.A.S. No.2066 (establishing a governing framework \"[d]uring the period in which it is necessary that the occupation continue\" and expressing the desire \"that the German people shall enjoy self-government to the maximum possible degree consistent with such occupation\"). The Court's holding in <i>Eisentrager</i> was thus consistent with the Insular Cases, where it had held there was no need to extend full constitutional protections to territories the United <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2261</span> States did not intend to govern indefinitely. Guantanamo Bay, on the other hand, is no transient possession. In every practical sense Guantanamo is not abroad; it is within the constant jurisdiction of the United States. See <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 480, 124 S.Ct. 2686; <i>id.,</i> at 487, 124 S.Ct. 2686 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>As to the third factor, we recognize, as the Court did in <i>Eisentrager,</i> that there are costs to holding the Suspension Clause applicable in a case of military detention abroad. Habeas corpus proceedings may require expenditure of funds by the Government and may divert the attention of military personnel from other pressing tasks. While we are sensitive to these concerns, we do not find them dispositive. Compliance with any judicial process requires some incremental expenditure of resources. Yet civilian courts and the Armed Forces have functioned along side each other at various points in our history. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Duncan v. Kahanamoku,</i> 327 U.S. 304, 66 S.Ct. 606, 90 L.Ed. 688 (1946); <i>Ex parte Milligan,</i> 4 Wall. 2, 18 L.Ed. 281 (1866). The Government presents no credible arguments that the military mission at Guantanamo would be compromised if habeas corpus courts had jurisdiction to hear the detainees' claims. And in light of the plenary control the United States asserts over the base, none are apparent to us.</p>\n<p>The situation in <i>Eisentrager</i> was far different, given the historical context and nature of the military's mission in post-War Germany. When hostilities in the European Theater came to an end, the United States became responsible for an occupation zone encompassing over 57,000 square miles with a population of 18 million. See Letter from President Truman to Secretary of State Byrnes, (Nov. 28, 1945), in 8 Documents on American Foreign Relations 257 (R. Dennett &amp; R. Turner eds.1948); Pollock, A Territorial Pattern for the Military Occupation of Germany, 38 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 970, 975 (1944). In addition to supervising massive reconstruction and aid efforts the American forces stationed in Germany faced potential security threats from a defeated enemy. In retrospect the post-War occupation may seem uneventful. But at the time <i>Eisentrager</i> was decided, the Court was right to be concerned about judicial interference with the military's efforts to contain \"enemy elements, guerilla fighters, and `were-wolves.'\" 339 U.S., at 784, 70 S.Ct. 936.</p>\n<p>Similar threats are not apparent here; nor does the Government argue that they are. The United States Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay consists of 45 square miles of land and water. The base has been used, at various points, to house migrants and refugees temporarily. At present, however, other than the detainees themselves, the only long-term residents are American military personnel, their families, and a small number of workers. See History of Guantanamo Bay online at https://www.cnic. navy.mil/Guantanamo/AboutGTMO/gtmohistorygeneral/ gtmohistgeneral. The detainees have been deemed enemies of the United States. At present, dangerous as they may be if released, they are contained in a secure prison facility located on an isolated and heavily fortified military base.</p>\n<p>There is no indication, furthermore, that adjudicating a habeas corpus petition would cause friction with the host government. No Cuban court has jurisdiction over American military personnel at Guantanamo or the enemy combatants detained there. While obligated to abide by the terms of the lease, the United States is, for all practical purposes, answerable to no other sovereign for its acts on the base. Were that not the case, or if the detention <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2262</span> facility were located in an active theater of war, arguments that issuing the writ would be \"impracticable or anomalous\" would have more weight. See <i>Reid,</i> 354 U.S., at 74, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Under the facts presented here, however, there are few practical barriers to the running of the writ. To the extent barriers arise, habeas corpus procedures likely can be modified to address them. See Part VI-B, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>It is true that before today the Court has never held that noncitizens detained by our Government in territory over which another country maintains <i>de jure</i> sovereignty have any rights under our Constitution. But the cases before us lack any precise historical parallel. They involve individuals detained by executive order for the duration of a conflict that, if measured from September 11, 2001, to the present, is already among the longest wars in American history. See Oxford Companion to American Military History 849 (1999). The detainees, moreover, are held in a territory that, while technically not part of the United States, is under the complete and total control of our Government. Under these circumstances the lack of a precedent on point is no barrier to our holding.</p>\n<p>We hold that Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2, of the Constitution has full effect at Guantanamo Bay. If the privilege of habeas corpus is to be denied to the detainees now before us, Congress must act in accordance with the requirements of the Suspension Clause. Cf. <i>Hamdi,</i> 542 U.S., at 564, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"[I]ndefinite imprisonment on reasonable suspicion is not an available option of treatment for those accused of aiding the enemy, absent a suspension of the writ\"). This Court may not impose a <i>de facto</i> suspension by abstaining from these controversies. See <i>Hamdan,</i> 548 U.S., at 585, n. 16, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (\"[A]bstention is not appropriate in cases ... in which the legal challenge `turn[s] on the status of the persons as to whom the military asserted its power'\" (quoting <i>Schlesinger v. Councilman,</i> 420 U.S. 738, 759, 95 S.Ct. 1300, 43 L.Ed.2d 591 (1975))). The MCA does not purport to be a formal suspension of the writ; and the Government, in its submissions to us, has not argued that it is. Petitioners, therefore, are entitled to the privilege of habeas corpus to challenge the legality of their detention.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>In light of this holding the question becomes whether the statute stripping jurisdiction to issue the writ avoids the Suspension Clause mandate because Congress has provided adequate substitute procedures for habeas corpus. The Government submits there has been compliance with the Suspension Clause because the DTA review process in the Court of Appeals, see DTA \u00a7 1005(e), provides an adequate substitute. Congress has granted that court jurisdiction to consider</p>\n<blockquote>\"(i) whether the status determination of the [CSRT] ... was consistent with the standards and procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense ... and (ii) to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to make the determination is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742.</blockquote>\n<p>The Court of Appeals, having decided that the writ does not run to the detainees in any event, found it unnecessary to consider whether an adequate substitute has been provided. In the ordinary course we would remand to the Court of Appeals to consider this question in the first instance. See <i>Youakim v. Miller,</i> 425 U.S. 231, 234, 96 S.Ct. 1399, 47 L.Ed.2d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2263</span> 701 (1976) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> It is well settled, however, that the Court's practice of declining to address issues left unresolved in earlier proceedings is not an inflexible rule. <i>Ibid.</i> Departure from the rule is appropriate in \"exceptional\" circumstances. See <i>Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc.,</i> 543 U.S. 157, 169, 125 S.Ct. 577, 160 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004); <i>Duignan v. United States,</i> 274 U.S. 195, 200, 47 S.Ct. 566, 71 L.Ed. 996 (1927).</p>\n<p>The gravity of the separation-of-powers issues raised by these cases and the fact that these detainees have been denied meaningful access to a judicial forum for a period of years render these cases exceptional. The parties before us have addressed the adequacy issue. While we would have found it informative to consider the reasoning of the Court of Appeals on this point, we must weigh that against the harms petitioners may endure from additional delay. And, given there are few precedents addressing what features an adequate substitute for habeas corpus must contain, in all likelihood a remand simply would delay ultimate resolution of the issue by this Court.</p>\n<p>We do have the benefit of the Court of Appeals' construction of key provisions of the DTA. When we granted certiorari in these cases, we noted \"it would be of material assistance to consult any decision\" in the parallel DTA review proceedings pending in the Court of Appeals, specifically any rulings in the matter of <i>Bismullah v. Gates.</i> 551 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1345, 170 L.Ed.2d 271 (2007). Although the Court of Appeals has yet to complete a DTA review proceeding, the three-judge panel in <i>Bismullah</i> has issued an interim order giving guidance as to what evidence can be made part of the record on review and what access the detainees can have to counsel and to classified information. See 501 F.3d 178 (C.A.D.C.) <i>(Bismullah I),</i> reh'g denied, 503 F.3d 137 (C.A.D.C.2007) <i>(Bismullah II).</i> In that matter the full court denied the Government's motion for rehearing en banc, see <i>Bismullah v. Gates,</i> 514 F.3d 1291 (C.A.D.C.2008) <i>(Bismullah III)</i><i>.</i> The order denying rehearing was accompanied by five separate statements from members of the court, which offer differing views as to scope of the judicial review Congress intended these detainees to have. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Under the circumstances we believe the costs of further delay substantially outweigh any benefits of remanding to the Court of Appeals to consider the issue it did not address in these cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Our case law does not contain extensive discussion of standards defining suspension of the writ or of circumstances under which suspension has occurred. This simply confirms the care Congress has taken throughout our Nation's history to preserve the writ and its function. Indeed, most of the major legislative enactments pertaining to habeas corpus have acted not to contract the writ's protection but to expand it or to hasten resolution of prisoners' claims. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, ch. 28, \u00a7 1, 14 Stat. 385 (current version codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (extending the federal writ to state prisoners)); Cf. <i>Harris v. Nelson,</i> 394 U.S. 286, 299-300, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 22 L.Ed.2d 281 (1969) (interpreting the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, to allow discovery in habeas corpus proceedings); <i>Peyton v. Rowe,</i> 391 U.S. 54, 64-65, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968) (interpreting the then-existing version of \u00a7 2241 to allow petitioner to proceed with his habeas corpus action, even though he had not yet begun to serve his sentence).</p>\n<p>There are exceptions, of course. Title I of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2264</span> Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \u00a7 106, 110 Stat. 1220, contains certain gatekeeping provisions that restrict a prisoner's ability to bring new and repetitive claims in \"second or successive\" habeas corpus actions. We upheld these provisions against a Suspension Clause challenge in <i>Felker v. Turpin,</i> 518 U.S. 651, 662-664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996). The provisions at issue in <i>Felker,</i> however, did not constitute a substantial departure from common-law habeas procedures. The provisions, for the most part, codified the longstanding abuse-of-the-writ doctrine. <i>Id.,</i> at 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333; see also <i>McCleskey v. Zant,</i> 499 U.S. 467, 489, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991). AEDPA applies, moreover, to federal, postconviction review after criminal proceedings in state court have taken place. As of this point, cases discussing the implementation of that statute give little helpful instruction (save perhaps by contrast) for the instant cases, where no trial has been held.</p>\n<p>The two leading cases addressing habeas substitutes, <i>Swain v. Pressley,</i> 430 U.S. 372, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977), and <i>United States v. Hayman,</i> 342 U.S. 205, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952), likewise provide little guidance here. The statutes at issue were attempts to streamline habeas corpus relief, not to cut it back.</p>\n<p>The statute discussed in <i>Hayman</i> was 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. It replaced traditional habeas corpus for federal prisoners (at least in the first instance) with a process that allowed the prisoner to file a motion with the sentencing court on the ground that his sentence was, <i>inter alia,</i> \"`imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.'\" 342 U.S., at 207, n. 1, 72 S.Ct. 263. The purpose and effect of the statute was not to restrict access to the writ but to make postconviction proceedings more efficient. It directed claims not to the court that had territorial jurisdiction over the place of the petitioner's confinement but to the sentencing court, a court already familiar with the facts of the case. As the <i>Hayman</i> Court explained</p>\n<blockquote>\"Section 2255 ... was passed at the instance of the Judicial Conference to meet practical difficulties that had arisen in administering the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal courts. Nowhere in the history of Section 2255 do we find any purpose to impinge upon prisoners' rights of collateral attack upon their convictions. On the contrary, the sole purpose was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 219, 72 S.Ct. 263.</blockquote>\n<p>See also <i>Hill v. United States,</i> 368 U.S. 424, 427, 428, and n. 5, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962) (noting that \u00a7 2255 provides a remedy in the sentencing court that is \"exactly commensurate\" with the pre-existing federal habeas corpus remedy).</p>\n<p>The statute in <i>Swain,</i> D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 23-110(g) (1973), applied to prisoners in custody under sentence of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Before enactment of the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970 (D.C. Court Reform Act), 84 Stat. 473, those prisoners could file habeas petitions in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The Act, which was patterned on \u00a7 2255, substituted a new collateral process in the Superior Court for the pre-existing habeas corpus procedure in the District Court. See <i>Swain,</i> 430 U.S., at 374-378, 97 S.Ct. 1224. But, again, the purpose and effect of the statute was to expedite consideration of the prisoner's claims, not to delay or frustrate it. See <i>id.,</i> at 375, n. 4, 97 S.Ct. 1224 (noting that the purpose of the D.C. Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2265</span> Reform Act was to \"alleviate\" administrative burdens on the District Court).</p>\n<p>That the statutes in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain</i> were designed to strengthen, rather than dilute, the writ's protections was evident, furthermore, from this significant fact: Neither statute eliminated traditional habeas corpus relief. In both cases the statute at issue had a saving clause, providing that a writ of habeas corpus would be available if the alternative process proved inadequate or ineffective. <i>Swain, supra,</i> at 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224; <i>Hayman, supra,</i> at 223, 72 S.Ct. 263. The Court placed explicit reliance upon these provisions in upholding the statutes against constitutional challenges. See <i>Swain, supra,</i> at 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224 (noting that the provision \"avoid[ed] any serious question about the constitutionality of the statute\"); <i>Hayman, supra,</i> at 223, 72 S.Ct. 263 (noting that, because habeas remained available as a last resort, it was unnecessary to \"reach constitutional questions\").</p>\n<p>Unlike in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain,</i> here we confront statutes, the DTA and the MCA, that were intended to circumscribe habeas review. Congress' purpose is evident not only from the unequivocal nature of MCA \u00a7 7's jurisdiction-stripping language, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(e)(1) (Supp. 2007) (\"No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus...\"), but also from a comparison of the DTA to the statutes at issue in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain.</i> When interpreting a statute, we examine related provisions in other parts of the U.S.Code. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey,</i> 499 U.S. 83, 88-97, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68 (1991); <i>Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</i> 515 U.S. 687, 717-718, 115 S.Ct. 2407, 132 L.Ed.2d 597 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); see generally W. Eskridge, P. Frickey, &amp; E. Garrett, Cases and Materials on Legislation: Statutes and the Creation of Public Policy 1039 (3d ed.2001). When Congress has intended to replace traditional habeas corpus with habeas-like substitutes, as was the case in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain,</i> it has granted to the courts broad remedial powers to secure the historic office of the writ. In the \u00a7 2255 context, for example, Congress has granted to the reviewing court power to \"determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law\" with respect to whether \"the judgment [of conviction] was rendered without jurisdiction, or ... the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack.\" 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255(b) (Supp.2008). The D.C. Court Reform Act, the statute upheld in <i>Swain,</i> contained a similar provision. \u00a7 23-110(g), 84 Stat. 609.</p>\n<p>In contrast the DTA's jurisdictional grant is quite limited. The Court of Appeals has jurisdiction not to inquire into the legality of the detention generally but only to assess whether the CSRT complied with the \"standards and procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense\" and whether those standards and procedures are lawful. DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742. If Congress had envisioned DTA review as coextensive with traditional habeas corpus, it would not have drafted the statute in this manner. Instead, it would have used language similar to what it used in the statutes at issue in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain.</i> Cf. <i>Russello v. United States,</i> 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (\"`[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Wong Kim Bo,</i> 472 F.2d 720, 722 (C.A.5 1972))). Unlike in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain,</i> moreover, there has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2266</span> been no effort to preserve habeas corpus review as an avenue of last resort. No saving clause exists in either the MCA or the DTA. And MCA \u00a7 7 eliminates habeas review for these petitioners.</p>\n<p>The differences between the DTA and the habeas statute that would govern in MCA \u00a7 7's absence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000 ed. and Supp. V), are likewise telling. In \u00a7 2241 (2000 ed.) Congress confirmed the authority of \"any justice\" or \"circuit judge\" to issue the writ. Cf. <i>Felker,</i> 518 U.S., at 660-661, 116 S.Ct. 2333 (interpreting Title I of AEDPA to not strip from this Court the power to entertain original habeas corpus petitions). That statute accommodates the necessity for factfinding that will arise in some cases by allowing the appellate judge or Justice to transfer the case to a district court of competent jurisdiction, whose institutional capacity for factfinding is superior to his or her own. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(b). By granting the Court of Appeals \"exclusive\" jurisdiction over petitioners' cases, see DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(A), 119 Stat. 2742, Congress has foreclosed that option. This choice indicates Congress intended the Court of Appeals to have a more limited role in enemy combatant status determinations than a district court has in habeas corpus proceedings. The DTA should be interpreted to accord some latitude to the Court of Appeals to fashion procedures necessary to make its review function a meaningful one, but, if congressional intent is to be respected, the procedures adopted cannot be as extensive or as protective of the rights of the detainees as they would be in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. Otherwise there would have been no, or very little, purpose for enacting the DTA.</p>\n<p>To the extent any doubt remains about Congress' intent, the legislative history confirms what the plain text strongly suggests: In passing the DTA Congress did not intend to create a process that differs from traditional habeas corpus process in name only. It intended to create a more limited procedure. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 151 Cong. Rec. S14263 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Graham) (noting that the DTA \"extinguish[es] these habeas and other actions in order to effect a transfer of jurisdiction over these cases to the DC Circuit Court\" and agreeing that the bill \"create[s] in their place a very limited judicial review of certain military administrative decisions\"); <i>id.,</i> at S14268 (statement of Sen. Kyl) (\"It is important to note that the limited judicial review authorized by paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection (e) [of DTA \u00a7 1005] are not habeas-corpus review. It is a limited judicial review of its own nature\").</p>\n<p>It is against this background that we must interpret the DTA and assess its adequacy as a substitute for habeas corpus. The present cases thus test the limits of the Suspension Clause in ways that <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain</i> did not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>We do not endeavor to offer a comprehensive summary of the requisites for an adequate substitute for habeas corpus. We do consider it uncontroversial, however, that the privilege of habeas corpus entitles the prisoner to a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pursuant to \"the erroneous application or interpretation\" of relevant law. <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S., at 302, 121 S.Ct. 2271. And the habeas court must have the power to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully detained\u0097though release need not be the exclusive remedy and is not the appropriate one in every case in which the writ is granted. See <i>Ex parte Bollman,</i> 4 Cranch 75, 136, 2 L.Ed. 554 (1807) (where imprisonment is unlawful, the court \"can only direct [the prisoner] to be discharged\"); R. Hurd, Treatise on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2267</span> Right of Personal Liberty, and On the Writ of Habeas Corpus and the Practice Connected with It: With a View of the Law of Extradition of Fugitives 222 (2d ed. 1876) (\"It cannot be denied where `a probable ground is shown that the party is imprisoned without just cause, and therefore, hath a right to be delivered,' for the writ then becomes a `writ of right, which may not be denied but ought to be granted to every man that is committed or detained in prison or otherwise restrained of his liberty'\"). But see <i>Chessman v. Teets,</i> 354 U.S. 156, 165-166, 77 S.Ct. 1127, 1 L.Ed.2d 1253 (1957) (remanding in a habeas case for retrial within a \"reasonable time\"). These are the easily identified attributes of any constitutionally adequate habeas corpus proceeding. But, depending on the circumstances, more may be required.</p>\n<p>Indeed, common-law habeas corpus was, above all, an adaptable remedy. Its precise application and scope changed depending upon the circumstances. See 3 Blackstone *131 (describing habeas as \"the great and efficacious writ, in all manner of illegal confinement\"); see also <i>Schlup v. Delo,</i> 513 U.S. 298, 319, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995) (Habeas \"is, at its core, an equitable remedy\"); <i>Jones v. Cunningham,</i> 371 U.S. 236, 243, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963) (Habeas is not \"a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose\"). It appears the common-law habeas court's role was most extensive in cases of pretrial and noncriminal detention, where there had been little or no previous judicial review of the cause for detention. Notably, the black-letter rule that prisoners could not controvert facts in the jailer's return was not followed (or at least not with consistency) in such cases. Hurd, <i>supra,</i> at 271 (noting that the general rule was \"subject to exceptions\" including cases of bail and impressment); Oakes, Legal History in the High Court\u0097Habeas Corpus, 64 Mich. L.Rev. 451, 457 (1966) (\"[W]hen a prisoner applied for habeas corpus before indictment or trial, some courts examined the written depositions on which he had been arrested or committed, and others even heard oral testimony to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to justifying holding him for trial\" (footnotes omitted)); Fallon &amp; Meltzer, Habeas Corpus Jurisdiction, Substantive Rights, and the War on Terror, 120 Harv. L.Rev.2029, 2102 (2007) (\"[T]he early practice was not consistent: courts occasionally permitted factual inquiries when no other opportunity for judicial review existed\").</p>\n<p>There is evidence from 19th-century American sources indicating that, even in States that accorded strong res judicata effect to prior adjudications, habeas courts in this country routinely allowed prisoners to introduce exculpatory evidence that was either unknown or previously unavailable to the prisoner. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ex parte Pattison,</i> 56 Miss. 161, 164 (1878) (noting that \"[w]hile the former adjudication must be considered as conclusive on the testimony then adduced\" \"newly developed exculpatory evidence ... may authorize the admission to bail\"); <i>Ex parte Foster,</i> 5 Tex. Ct.App. 625, 644 (1879) (construing the State's habeas statute to allow for the introduction of new evidence \"where important testimony has been obtained, which, though not newly discovered, or which, though known to [the petitioner], it was not in his power to produce at the former hearing; [and] where the evidence was newly discovered\"); <i>People v. Martin,</i> 7 N.Y. Leg. Obs. 49, 56 (1848) (\"If in custody on criminal process before indictment, the prisoner has an absolute right to demand that the original depositions be looked into to see whether any crime is in fact imputed to him, and the inquiry will by no means be confined to the return. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2268</span> Facts out of the return may be gone into to ascertain whether the committing magistrate may not have arrived at an illogical conclusion upon the evidence given before him ...\"); see generally (W. Church, Treatise on the Writ of Habeas Corpus \u00a7 182, p. 235 1886) (hereinafter Church) (noting that habeas courts would \"hear evidence anew if justice require it\"). Justice McLean, on Circuit in 1855, expressed his view that a habeas court should consider a prior judgment conclusive \"where there was clearly jurisdiction and a full and fair hearing; but that it might not be so considered when any of these requisites were wanting.\" <i>Ex parte Robinson,</i> 20 F. Cas. 969, 971, (No. 11,935) (CC Ohio 1855). To illustrate the circumstances in which the prior adjudication did not bind the habeas court, he gave the example of a case in which \"[s]everal unimpeached witnesses\" provided new evidence to exculpate the prisoner. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The idea that the necessary scope of habeas review in part depends upon the rigor of any earlier proceedings accords with our test for procedural adequacy in the due process context. See <i>Mathews v. Eldridge,</i> 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976) (noting that the Due Process Clause requires an assessment of, <i>inter alia,</i> \"the risk of an erroneous deprivation of [a liberty interest;] and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards\"). This principle has an established foundation in habeas corpus jurisprudence as well, as Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in <i>Ex parte Watkins,</i> 3 Pet. 193, 7 L.Ed. 650 (1830), demonstrates. Like the petitioner in <i>Swain,</i> Watkins sought a writ of habeas corpus after being imprisoned pursuant to a judgment of a District of Columbia court. In holding that the judgment stood on \"high ground,\" 3 Pet., at 209, 7 L.Ed. 650, the Chief Justice emphasized the character of the court that rendered the original judgment, noting it was a \"court of record, having general jurisdiction over criminal cases.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 203. In contrast to \"inferior\" tribunals of limited jurisdiction, <i>ibid.,</i> courts of record had broad remedial powers, which gave the habeas court greater confidence in the judgment's validity. See generally Neuman, Habeas Corpus, Executive Detention, and the Removal of Aliens, 98 Colum. L.Rev. 961, 982-983 (1998).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, where relief is sought from a sentence that resulted from the judgment of a court of record, as was the case in <i>Watkins</i> and indeed in most federal habeas cases, considerable deference is owed to the court that ordered confinement. See <i>Brown v. Allen,</i> 344 U.S. 443, 506, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.) (noting that a federal habeas court should accept a state court's factual findings unless \"a vital flaw be found in the process of ascertaining such facts in the State court\"). Likewise in those cases the prisoner should exhaust adequate alternative remedies before filing for the writ in federal court. See <i>Ex parte Royall,</i> 117 U.S. 241, 251-252, 6 S.Ct. 734, 29 L.Ed. 868 (1886) (requiring exhaustion of state collateral processes). Both aspects of federal habeas corpus review are justified because it can be assumed that, in the usual course, a court of record provides defendants with a fair, adversary proceeding. In cases involving state convictions this framework also respects federalism; and in federal cases it has added justification because the prisoner already has had a chance to seek review of his conviction in a federal forum through a direct appeal. The present cases fall outside these categories, however; for here the detention is by executive order.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2269</span> Where a person is detained by executive order, rather than, say, after being tried and convicted in a court, the need for collateral review is most pressing. A criminal conviction in the usual course occurs after a judicial hearing before a tribunal disinterested in the outcome and committed to procedures designed to ensure its own independence. These dynamics are not inherent in executive detention orders or executive review procedures. In this context the need for habeas corpus is more urgent. The intended duration of the detention and the reasons for it bear upon the precise scope of the inquiry. Habeas corpus proceedings need not resemble a criminal trial, even when the detention is by executive order. But the writ must be effective. The habeas court must have sufficient authority to conduct a meaningful review of both the cause for detention and the Executive's power to detain.</p>\n<p>To determine the necessary scope of habeas corpus review, therefore, we must assess the CSRT process, the mechanism through which petitioners' designation as enemy combatants became final. Whether one characterizes the CSRT process as direct review of the Executive's battlefield determination that the detainee is an enemy combatant\u0097as the parties have and as we do\u0097or as the first step in the collateral review of a battlefield determination makes no difference in a proper analysis of whether the procedures Congress put in place are an adequate substitute for habeas corpus. What matters is the sum total of procedural protections afforded to the detainee at all stages, direct and collateral.</p>\n<p>Petitioners identify what they see as myriad deficiencies in the CSRTs. The most relevant for our purposes are the constraints upon the detainee's ability to rebut the factual basis for the Government's assertion that he is an enemy combatant. As already noted, see Part IV-C, <i>supra,</i> at the CSRT stage the detainee has limited means to find or present evidence to challenge the Government's case against him. He does not have the assistance of counsel and may not be aware of the most critical allegations that the Government relied upon to order his detention. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, at 156, \u00b6 F(8) (noting that the detainee can access only the \"unclassified portion of the Government Information\"). The detainee can confront witnesses that testify during the CSRT proceedings. <i>Id.,</i> at 144, \u00b6 <i>g</i> (8). But given that there are in effect no limits on the admission of hearsay evidence\u0097the only requirement is that the tribunal deem the evidence \"relevant and helpful,\" <i>ibid.,</i> \u00b6 <i>g</i> (9)\u0097the detainee's opportunity to question witnesses is likely to be more theoretical than real.</p>\n<p>The Government defends the CSRT process, arguing that it was designed to conform to the procedures suggested by the plurality in <i>Hamdi.</i> See 542 U.S., at 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633. Setting aside the fact that the relevant language in <i>Hamdi</i> did not garner a majority of the Court, it does not control the matter at hand. None of the parties in <i>Hamdi</i> argued there had been a suspension of the writ. Nor could they. The \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus process remained in place, <i>id.,</i> at 525, 124 S.Ct. 2633. Accordingly, the plurality concentrated on whether the Executive had the authority to detain and, if so, what rights the detainee had under the Due Process Clause. True, there are places in the <i>Hamdi</i> plurality opinion where it is difficult to tell where its extrapolation of \u00a7 2241 ends and its analysis of the petitioner's Due Process rights begins. But the Court had no occasion to define the necessary scope of habeas review, for Suspension Clause purposes, in the context of enemy combatant detentions. The closest the plurality came to doing so was in discussing whether, in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2270</span> light of separation-of-powers concerns, \u00a7 2241 should be construed to forbid the District Court from inquiring beyond the affidavit Hamdi's custodian provided in answer to the detainee's habeas petition. The plurality answered this question with an emphatic \"no.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 527, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (labeling this argument as \"extreme\"); <i>id.,</i> at 535-536, 124 S.Ct. 2633.</p>\n<p>Even if we were to assume that the CSRTs satisfy due process standards, it would not end our inquiry. Habeas corpus is a collateral process that exists, in Justice Holmes' words, to \"cu[t] through all forms and g[o] to the very tissue of the structure. It comes in from the outside, not in subordination to the proceedings, and although every form may have been preserved opens the inquiry whether they have been more than an empty shell.\" <i>Frank v. Mangum,</i> 237 U.S. 309, 346, 35 S.Ct. 582, 59 L.Ed. 969 (1915) (dissenting opinion). Even when the procedures authorizing detention are structurally sound, the Suspension Clause remains applicable and the writ relevant. See 2 Chambers, Course of Lectures on English Law 1767-1773, at 6 (\"Liberty may be violated either by arbitrary <i>imprisonment</i> without law or the appearance of law, or by a lawful magistrate for an unlawful reason\"). This is so, as <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain</i> make clear, even where the prisoner is detained after a criminal trial conducted in full accordance with the protections of the Bill of Rights. Were this not the case, there would have been no reason for the Court to inquire into the adequacy of substitute habeas procedures in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain.</i> That the prisoners were detained pursuant to the most rigorous proceedings imaginable, a full criminal trial, would have been enough to render any habeas substitute acceptable <i>per se.</i></p>\n<p>Although we make no judgment as to whether the CSRTs, as currently constituted, satisfy due process standards, we agree with petitioners that, even when all the parties involved in this process act with diligence and in good faith, there is considerable risk of error in the tribunal's findings of fact. This is a risk inherent in any process that, in the words of the former Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, is \"closed and accusatorial.\" See <i>Bismullah III,</i> 514 F.3d, at 1296 (Ginsburg, C. J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc). And given that the consequence of error may be detention of persons for the duration of hostilities that may last a generation or more, this is a risk too significant to ignore.</p>\n<p>For the writ of habeas corpus, or its substitute, to function as an effective and proper remedy in this context, the court that conducts the habeas proceeding must have the means to correct errors that occurred during the CSRT proceedings. This includes some authority to assess the sufficiency of the Government's evidence against the detainee. It also must have the authority to admit and consider relevant exculpatory evidence that was not introduced during the earlier proceeding. Federal habeas petitioners long have had the means to supplement the record on review, even in the postconviction habeas setting. See <i>Townsend v. Sain,</i> 372 U.S. 293, 313, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), overruled in part by <i>Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes,</i> 504 U.S. 1, 5, 112 S.Ct. 1715, 118 L.Ed.2d 318 (1992). Here that opportunity is constitutionally required.</p>\n<p>Consistent with the historic function and province of the writ, habeas corpus review may be more circumscribed if the underlying detention proceedings are more thorough than they were here. In two habeas cases involving enemy aliens tried for war crimes, <i>In re Yamashita,</i> 327 U.S. 1, 66 S.Ct. 340, 90 L.Ed. 499 (1946), and <i>Ex parte Quirin,</i> 317 U.S. 1, 63 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2271</span> 2, 87 L.Ed. 3 (1942), for example, this Court limited its review to determining whether the Executive had legal authority to try the petitioners by military commission. See <i>Yamashita, supra,</i> at 8, 66 S.Ct. 340 (\"[O]n application for habeas corpus we are not concerned with the guilt or innocence of the petitioners. We consider here only the lawful power of the commission to try the petitioner for the offense charged\"); <i>Quirin, supra,</i> at 25, 63 S.Ct. 2 (\"We are not here concerned with any question of the guilt or innocence of petitioners\"). Military courts are not courts of record. See <i>Watkins,</i> 3 Pet., at 209; Church 513. And the procedures used to try General Yamashita have been sharply criticized by Members of this Court. See <i>Hamdan,</i> 548 U.S., at 617, 126 S.Ct. 2749; <i>Yamashita, supra,</i> at 41-81, 66 S.Ct. 340 (Rutledge, J., dissenting). We need not revisit these cases, however. For on their own terms, the proceedings in <i>Yamashita</i> and <i>Quirin,</i> like those in <i>Eisentrager,</i> had an adversarial structure that is lacking here. See <i>Yamashita, supra,</i> at 5, 66 S.Ct. 340 (noting that General Yamashita was represented by six military lawyers and that \"[t]hroughout the proceedings ... defense counsel ... demonstrated their professional skill and resourcefulness and their proper zeal for the defense with which they were charged\"); <i>Quirin, supra,</i> at 23-24, 63 S.Ct. 2; Exec. Order No. 9185, 7 Fed.Reg. 5103 (1942) (appointing counsel to represent the German saboteurs).</p>\n<p>The extent of the showing required of the Government in these cases is a matter to be determined. We need not explore it further at this stage. We do hold that when the judicial power to issue habeas corpus properly is invoked the judicial officer must have adequate authority to make a determination in light of the relevant law and facts and to formulate and issue appropriate orders for relief, including, if necessary, an order directing the prisoner's release.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>We now consider whether the DTA allows the Court of Appeals to conduct a proceeding meeting these standards. \"[W]e are obligated to construe the statute to avoid [constitutional] problems\" if it is \"`fairly possible'\" to do so. <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S., at 299-300, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (quoting <i>Crowell v. Benson,</i> 285 U.S. 22, 62, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932)). There are limits to this principle, however. The canon of constitutional avoidance does not supplant traditional modes of statutory interpretation. See <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U.S. 371, 385, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005) (\"The canon of constitutional avoidance comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction; and the canon functions as <i>a means of choosing between them</i>\"). We cannot ignore the text and purpose of a statute in order to save it.</p>\n<p>The DTA does not explicitly empower the Court of Appeals to order the applicant in a DTA review proceeding released should the court find that the standards and procedures used at his CSRT hearing were insufficient to justify detention. This is troubling. Yet, for present purposes, we can assume congressional silence permits a constitutionally required remedy. In that case it would be possible to hold that a remedy of release is impliedly provided for. The DTA might be read, furthermore, to allow the petitioners to assert most, if not all, of the legal claims they seek to advance, including their most basic claim: that the President has no authority under the AUMF to detain them indefinitely. (Whether the President has such authority turns on whether the AUMF <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2272</span> authorizes\u0097and the Constitution permits\u0097the indefinite detention of \"enemy combatants\" as the Department of Defense defines that term. Thus a challenge to the President's authority to detain is, in essence, a challenge to the Department's definition of enemy combatant, a \"standard\" used by the CSRTs in petitioners' cases.) At oral argument, the Solicitor General urged us to adopt both these constructions, if doing so would allow MCA \u00a7 7 to remain intact. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37, 53.</p>\n<p>The absence of a release remedy and specific language allowing AUMF challenges are not the only constitutional infirmities from which the statute potentially suffers, however. The more difficult question is whether the DTA permits the Court of Appeals to make requisite findings of fact. The DTA enables petitioners to request \"review\" of their CSRT determination in the Court of Appeals, DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(B)(i), 119 Stat. 2742; but the \"Scope of Review\" provision confines the Court of Appeals' role to reviewing whether the CSRT followed the \"standards and procedures\" issued by the Department of Defense and assessing whether those \"standards and procedures\" are lawful. \u00a7 1005(e)(C), <i>ibid.</i> Among these standards is \"the requirement that the conclusion of the Tribunal be supported by a preponderance of the evidence ... allowing a rebuttable presumption in favor of the Government's evidence.\" \u00a7 1005(e)(C)(i), <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Assuming the DTA can be construed to allow the Court of Appeals to review or correct the CSRT's factual determinations, as opposed to merely certifying that the tribunal applied the correct standard of proof, we see no way to construe the statute to allow what is also constitutionally required in this context: an opportunity for the detainee to present relevant exculpatory evidence that was not made part of the record in the earlier proceedings.</p>\n<p>On its face the statute allows the Court of Appeals to consider no evidence outside the CSRT record. In the parallel litigation, however, the Court of Appeals determined that the DTA allows it to order the production of all \"`reasonably available information in the possession of the U.S. Government bearing on the issue of whether the detainee meets the criteria to be designated as an enemy combatant,'\" regardless of whether this evidence was put before the CSRT. See <i>Bismullah I,</i> 501 F.3d, at 180. The Government, see Pet. for Cert. pending in <i>Gates v. Bismullah,</i> No. 07-1054 (hereinafter <i>Bismullah</i> Pet.), with support from five members of the Court of Appeals, see <i>Bismullah III,</i> 514 F.3d, at 1299 (Henderson, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); <i>id.,</i> at 1302 (opinion of Randolph, J.) (same); <i>id.,</i> at 1306 (opinion of Brown, J.) (same), disagrees with this interpretation. For present purposes, however, we can assume that the Court of Appeals was correct that the DTA allows introduction and consideration of relevant exculpatory evidence that was \"reasonably available\" to the Government at the time of the CSRT but not made part of the record. Even so, the DTA review proceeding falls short of being a constitutionally adequate substitute, for the detainee still would have no opportunity to present evidence discovered after the CSRT proceedings concluded.</p>\n<p>Under the DTA the Court of Appeals has the power to review CSRT determinations by assessing the legality of standards and procedures. This implies the power to inquire into what happened at the CSRT hearing and, perhaps, to remedy certain deficiencies in that proceeding. But should the Court of Appeals determine that the CSRT followed appropriate and lawful standards and procedures, it will <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2273</span> have reached the limits of its jurisdiction. There is no language in the DTA that can be construed to allow the Court of Appeals to admit and consider newly discovered evidence that could not have been made part of the CSRT record because it was unavailable to either the Government or the detainee when the CSRT made its findings. This evidence, however, may be critical to the detainee's argument that he is not an enemy combatant and there is no cause to detain him.</p>\n<p>This is not a remote hypothetical. One of the petitioners, Mohamed Nechla, requested at his CSRT hearing that the Government contact his employer. The petitioner claimed the employer would corroborate Nechla's contention he had no affiliation with al Qaeda. Although the CSRT determined this testimony would be relevant, it also found the witness was not reasonably available to testify at the time of the hearing. Petitioner's counsel, however, now represents the witness is available to be heard. See Brief for Boumediene Petitioners 5. If a detainee can present reasonably available evidence demonstrating there is no basis for his continued detention, he must have the opportunity to present this evidence to a habeas corpus court. Even under the Court of Appeals' generous construction of the DTA, however, the evidence identified by Nechla would be inadmissible in a DTA review proceeding. The role of an Article III court in the exercise of its habeas corpus function cannot be circumscribed in this manner.</p>\n<p>By foreclosing consideration of evidence not presented or reasonably available to the detainee at the CSRT proceedings, the DTA disadvantages the detainee by limiting the scope of collateral review to a record that may not be accurate or complete. In other contexts, <i>e.g.,</i> in post-trial habeas cases where the prisoner already has had a full and fair opportunity to develop the factual predicate of his claims, similar limitations on the scope of habeas review may be appropriate. See <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 420, 436-437, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (noting that \u00a7 2254 \"does not equate prisoners who exercise diligence in pursuing their claims with those who do not\"). In this context, however, where the underlying detention proceedings lack the necessary adversarial character, the detainee cannot be held responsible for all deficiencies in the record.</p>\n<p>The Government does not make the alternative argument that the DTA allows for the introduction of previously unavailable exculpatory evidence on appeal. It does point out, however, that if a detainee obtains such evidence, he can request that the Deputy Secretary of Defense convene a new CSRT. See Supp. Brief for Respondents 4. Whatever the merits of this procedure, it is an insufficient replacement for the factual review these detainees are entitled to receive through habeas corpus. The Deputy Secretary's determination whether to initiate new proceedings is wholly a discretionary one. See Dept. of Defense, Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants, Instruction 5421.1, Procedure for Review of \"New Evidence\" Relating to Enemy Combatant (EC) Status \u00b6 5(d) (May 7, 2007) (Instruction 5421.1) (\"The decision to convene a CSRT to reconsider the basis of the detainee's [enemy combatant] status in light of `new evidence' is a matter vested in the unreviewable discretion of the [Deputy Secretary of Defense]\"). And we see no way to construe the DTA to allow a detainee to challenge the Deputy Secretary's decision not to open a new CSRT pursuant to Instruction 5421.1. Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to devise procedures for considering new evidence, see DTA \u00a7 1005(a)(3), but the detainee has no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2274</span> mechanism for ensuring that those procedures are followed. DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742, makes clear that the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction is \"limited to consideration of ... whether the status determination of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal with regard to such alien was consistent with the standards and procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense... and ... whether the use of such standards and procedures to make the determination is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(A), <i>ibid.,</i> further narrows the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction to reviewing \"any final decision of a Combatant Status Review Tribunal that an alien is properly detained as an enemy combatant.\" The Deputy Secretary's determination whether to convene a new CSRT is not a \"status determination of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal,\" much less a \"final decision\" of that body.</p>\n<p>We do not imply DTA review would be a constitutionally sufficient replacement for habeas corpus but for these limitations on the detainee's ability to present exculpatory evidence. For even if it were possible, as a textual matter, to read into the statute each of the necessary procedures we have identified, we could not overlook the cumulative effect of our doing so. To hold that the detainees at Guantanamo may, under the DTA, challenge the President's legal authority to detain them, contest the CSRT's findings of fact, supplement the record on review with exculpatory evidence, and request an order of release would come close to reinstating the \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus process Congress sought to deny them. The language of the statute, read in light of Congress' reasons for enacting it, cannot bear this interpretation. Petitioners have met their burden of establishing that the DTA review process is, on its face, an inadequate substitute for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p>Although we do not hold that an adequate substitute must duplicate \u00a7 2241 in all respects, it suffices that the Government has not established that the detainees' access to the statutory review provisions at issue is an adequate substitute for the writ of habeas corpus. MCA \u00a7 7 thus effects an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. In view of our holding we need not discuss the reach of the writ with respect to claims of unlawful conditions of treatment or confinement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In light of our conclusion that there is no jurisdictional bar to the District Court's entertaining petitioners' claims the question remains whether there are prudential barriers to habeas corpus review under these circumstances.</p>\n<p>The Government argues petitioners must seek review of their CSRT determinations in the Court of Appeals before they can proceed with their habeas corpus actions in the District Court. As noted earlier, in other contexts and for prudential reasons this Court has required exhaustion of alternative remedies before a prisoner can seek federal habeas relief. Most of these cases were brought by prisoners in state custody, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ex parte Royall,</i> 117 U.S. 241, 6 S.Ct. 734, 29 L.Ed. 868, and thus involved federalism concerns that are not relevant here. But we have extended this rule to require defendants in courts-martial to exhaust their military appeals before proceeding with a federal habeas corpus action. See <i>Schlesinger,</i> 420 U.S., at 758, 95 S.Ct. 1300.</p>\n<p>The real risks, the real threats, of terrorist attacks are constant and not likely soon to abate. The ways to disrupt our life and laws are so many and unforeseen <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2275</span> that the Court should not attempt even some general catalogue of crises that might occur. Certain principles are apparent, however. Practical considerations and exigent circumstances inform the definition and reach of the law's writs, including habeas corpus. The cases and our tradition reflect this precept.</p>\n<p>In cases involving foreign citizens detained abroad by the Executive, it likely would be both an impractical and unprecedented extension of judicial power to assume that habeas corpus would be available at the moment the prisoner is taken into custody. If and when habeas corpus jurisdiction applies, as it does in these cases, then proper deference can be accorded to reasonable procedures for screening and initial detention under lawful and proper conditions of confinement and treatment for a reasonable period of time. Domestic exigencies, furthermore, might also impose such onerous burdens on the Government that here, too, the Judicial Branch would be required to devise sensible rules for staying habeas corpus proceedings until the Government can comply with its requirements in a responsible way. Cf. <i>Ex parte Milligan,</i> 4 Wall., at 127 (\"If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, <i>then,</i> on the theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course\"). Here, as is true with detainees apprehended abroad, a relevant consideration in determining the courts' role is whether there are suitable alternative processes in place to protect against the arbitrary exercise of governmental power.</p>\n<p>The cases before us, however, do not involve detainees who have been held for a short period of time while awaiting their CSRT determinations. Were that the case, or were it probable that the Court of Appeals could complete a prompt review of their applications, the case for requiring temporary abstention or exhaustion of alternative remedies would be much stronger. These qualifications no longer pertain here. In some of these cases six years have elapsed without the judicial oversight that habeas corpus or an adequate substitute demands. And there has been no showing that the Executive faces such onerous burdens that it cannot respond to habeas corpus actions. To require these detainees to complete DTA review before proceeding with their habeas corpus actions would be to require additional months, if not years, of delay. The first DTA review applications were filed over a year ago, but no decisions on the merits have been issued. While some delay in fashioning new procedures is unavoidable, the costs of delay can no longer be borne by those who are held in custody. The detainees in these cases are entitled to a prompt habeas corpus hearing.</p>\n<p>Our decision today holds only that the petitioners before us are entitled to seek the writ; that the DTA review procedures are an inadequate substitute for habeas corpus; and that the petitioners in these cases need not exhaust the review procedures in the Court of Appeals before proceeding with their habeas actions in the District Court. The only law we identify as unconstitutional is MCA \u00a7 7, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(e) (Supp.2007). Accordingly, both the DTA and the CSRT process remain intact. Our holding with regard to exhaustion should not be read to imply that a habeas court should intervene <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2276</span> the moment an enemy combatant steps foot in a territory where the writ runs. The Executive is entitled to a reasonable period of time to determine a detainee's status before a court entertains that detainee's habeas corpus petition. The CSRT process is the mechanism Congress and the President set up to deal with these issues. Except in cases of undue delay, federal courts should refrain from entertaining an enemy combatant's habeas corpus petition at least until after the Department, acting via the CSRT, has had a chance to review his status.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Although we hold that the DTA is not an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus, it does not follow that a habeas corpus court may disregard the dangers the detention in these cases was intended to prevent. <i>Felker, Swain,</i> and <i>Hayman</i> stand for the proposition that the Suspension Clause does not resist innovation in the field of habeas corpus. Certain accommodations can be made to reduce the burden habeas corpus proceedings will place on the military without impermissibly diluting the protections of the writ.</p>\n<p>In the DTA Congress sought to consolidate review of petitioners' claims in the Court of Appeals. Channeling future cases to one district court would no doubt reduce administrative burdens on the Government. This is a legitimate objective that might be advanced even without an amendment to \u00a7 2241. If, in a future case, a detainee files a habeas petition in another judicial district in which a proper respondent can be served, see <i>Rumsfeld v. Padilla,</i> 542 U.S. 426, 435-436, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004), the Government can move for change of venue to the court that will hear these petitioners' cases, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a); <i>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,</i> 410 U.S. 484, 499, n. 15, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973).</p>\n<p>Another of Congress' reasons for vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals, perhaps, was to avoid the widespread dissemination of classified information. The Government has raised similar concerns here and elsewhere. See Brief for Respondents 55-56; <i>Bismullah</i> Pet. 30. We make no attempt to anticipate all of the evidentiary and access-to-counsel issues that will arise during the course of the detainees' habeas corpus proceedings. We recognize, however, that the Government has a legitimate interest in protecting sources and methods of intelligence gathering; and we expect that the District Court will use its discretion to accommodate this interest to the greatest extent possible. Cf. <i>United States v. Reynolds,</i> 345 U.S. 1, 10, 73 S.Ct. 528, 97 L.Ed. 727 (1953) (recognizing an evidentiary privilege in a civil damages case where \"there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged\").</p>\n<p>These and the other remaining questions are within the expertise and competence of the District Court to address in the first instance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>In considering both the procedural and substantive standards used to impose detention to prevent acts of terrorism, proper deference must be accorded to the political branches. See <i>United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,</i> 299 U.S. 304, 320, 57 S.Ct. 216, 81 L.Ed. 255 (1936). Unlike the President and some designated Members of Congress, neither the Members of this Court nor most federal judges begin the day with briefings that may describe new and serious threats to our Nation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2277</span> and its people. The law must accord the Executive substantial authority to apprehend and detain those who pose a real danger to our security.</p>\n<p>Officials charged with daily operational responsibility for our security may consider a judicial discourse on the history of the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679 and like matters to be far removed from the Nation's present, urgent concerns. Established legal doctrine, however, must be consulted for its teaching. Remote in time it may be; irrelevant to the present it is not. Security depends upon a sophisticated intelligence apparatus and the ability of our Armed Forces to act and to interdict. There are further considerations, however. Security subsists, too, in fidelity to freedom's first principles. Chief among these are freedom from arbitrary and unlawful restraint and the personal liberty that is secured by adherence to the separation of powers. It is from these principles that the judicial authority to consider petitions for habeas corpus relief derives.</p>\n<p>Our opinion does not undermine the Executive's powers as Commander in Chief. On the contrary, the exercise of those powers is vindicated, not eroded, when confirmed by the Judicial Branch. Within the Constitution's separation-of-powers structure, few exercises of judicial power are as legitimate or as necessary as the responsibility to hear challenges to the authority of the Executive to imprison a person. Some of these petitioners have been in custody for six years with no definitive judicial determination as to the legality of their detention. Their access to the writ is a necessity to determine the lawfulness of their status, even if, in the end, they do not obtain the relief they seek.</p>\n<p>Because our Nation's past military conflicts have been of limited duration, it has been possible to leave the outer boundaries of war powers undefined. If, as some fear, terrorism continues to pose dangerous threats to us for years to come, the Court might not have this luxury. This result is not inevitable, however. The political branches, consistent with their independent obligations to interpret and uphold the Constitution, can engage in a genuine debate about how best to preserve constitutional values while protecting the Nation from terrorism. Cf. <i>Hamdan,</i> 548 U.S., at 636, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (BREYER, J., concurring) (\"[J]udicial insistence upon that consultation does not weaken our Nation's ability to deal with danger. To the contrary, that insistence strengthens the Nation's ability to determine\u0097through democratic means\u0097how best to do so\").</p>\n<p>It bears repeating that our opinion does not address the content of the law that governs petitioners' detention. That is a matter yet to be determined. We hold that petitioners may invoke the fundamental procedural protections of habeas corpus. The laws and Constitution are designed to survive, and remain in force, in extraordinary times. Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law. The Framers decided that habeas corpus, a right of first importance, must be a part of that framework, a part of that law.</p>\n<p>The determination by the Court of Appeals that the Suspension Clause and its protections are inapplicable to petitioners was in error. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The cases are remanded to the Court of Appeals with instructions that it remand the cases to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice GINSBURG and Justice BREYER join, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court's opinion in its entirety and add this afterword only to emphasize <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2278</span> two things one might overlook after reading the dissents.</p>\n<p>Four years ago, this Court in <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> 542 U.S. 466, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004) held that statutory habeas jurisdiction extended to claims of foreign nationals imprisoned by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, \"to determine the legality of the Executive's potentially indefinite detention\" of them, <i>id.,</i> at 485, 124 S.Ct. 2686. Subsequent legislation eliminated the statutory habeas jurisdiction over these claims, so that now there must be constitutionally based jurisdiction or none at all. Justice SCALIA is thus correct that here, for the first time, this Court holds there is (he says \"confers\") constitutional habeas jurisdiction over aliens imprisoned by the military outside an area of <i>de jure</i> national sovereignty, see <i>post,</i> at 2293 (dissenting opinion). But no one who reads the Court's opinion in <i>Rasul</i> could seriously doubt that the jurisdictional question must be answered the same way in purely constitutional cases, given the Court's reliance on the historical background of habeas generally in answering the statutory question. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 542 U.S., at 473, 481-483, and nn. 11-14, 124 S.Ct. 2686. Indeed, the Court in <i>Rasul</i> directly answered the very historical question that Justice SCALIA says is dispositive, see <i>post,</i> at 2303; it wrote that \"[a]pplication of the habeas statute to persons detained at [Guantanamo] is consistent with the historical reach of the writ of habeas corpus,\" 542 U.S., at 481, 124 S.Ct. 2686. Justice SCALIA dismisses the statement as dictum, see <i>post,</i> at 2304-2305, but if dictum it was, it was dictum well considered, and it stated the view of five Members of this Court on the historical scope of the writ. Of course, it takes more than a quotation from <i>Rasul,</i> however much on point, to resolve the constitutional issue before us here, which the majority opinion has explored afresh in the detail it deserves. But whether one agrees or disagrees with today's decision, it is no bolt out of the blue.</p>\n<p>A second fact insufficiently appreciated by the dissents is the length of the disputed imprisonments, some of the prisoners represented here today having been locked up for six years, <i>ante,</i> at 2275-2276 (opinion of the Court). Hence the hollow ring when the dissenters suggest that the Court is somehow precipitating the judiciary into reviewing claims that the military (subject to appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit) could handle within some reasonable period of time. See, <i>e.g., post,</i> at 2280 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (\"[T]he Court should have declined to intervene until the D.C. Circuit had assessed the nature and validity of the congressionally mandated proceedings in a given detainee's case\"); <i>post,</i> at 2281 (\"[I]t is not necessary to consider the availability of the writ until the statutory remedies have been shown to be inadequate\"); <i>post,</i> at 2283 (\"[The Court] rushes to decide the fundamental question of the reach of habeas corpus when the functioning of the DTA may make that decision entirely unnecessary\"). These suggestions of judicial haste are all the more out of place given the Court's realistic acknowledgment that in periods of exigency the tempo of any habeas review must reflect the immediate peril facing the country. See <i>ante,</i> at 2274-2275.</p>\n<p>It is in fact the very lapse of four years from the time <i>Rasul</i> put everyone on notice that habeas process was available to Guantanamo prisoners, and the lapse of six years since some of these prisoners were captured and incarcerated, that stand at odds with the repeated suggestions of the dissenters that these cases should be seen as a judicial victory in a contest for power between the Court and the political branches. See <i>post,</i> at 2279, 2280, 2293 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting); <i>post,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2279</span> 2295-2296, 2296, 2302, 2303, 2306-2307 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The several answers to the charge of triumphalism might start with a basic fact of Anglo-American constitutional history: that the power, first of the Crown and now of the Executive Branch of the United States, is necessarily limited by habeas corpus jurisdiction to enquire into the legality of executive detention. And one could explain that in this Court's exercise of responsibility to preserve habeas corpus something much more significant is involved than pulling and hauling between the judicial and political branches. Instead, though, it is enough to repeat that some of these petitioners have spent six years behind bars. After six years of sustained executive detentions in Guantanamo, subject to habeas jurisdiction but without any actual habeas scrutiny, today's decision is no judicial victory, but an act of perseverance in trying to make habeas review, and the obligation of the courts to provide it, mean something of value both to prisoners and to the Nation. See <i>ante,</i> at 2277.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice SCALIA, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Today the Court strikes down as inadequate the most generous set of procedural protections ever afforded aliens detained by this country as enemy combatants. The political branches crafted these procedures amidst an ongoing military conflict, after much careful investigation and thorough debate. The Court rejects them today out of hand, without bothering to say what due process rights the detainees possess, without explaining how the statute fails to vindicate those rights, and before a single petitioner has even attempted to avail himself of the law's operation. And to what effect? The majority merely replaces a review system designed by the people's representatives with a set of shapeless procedures to be defined by federal courts at some future date. One cannot help but think, after surveying the modest practical results of the majority's ambitious opinion, that this decision is not really about the detainees at all, but about control of federal policy regarding enemy combatants.</p>\n<p>The majority is adamant that the Guantanamo detainees are entitled to the protections of habeas corpus\u0097its opinion begins by deciding that question. I regard the issue as a difficult one, primarily because of the unique and unusual jurisdictional status of Guantanamo Bay. I nonetheless agree with Justice SCALIA's analysis of our precedents and the pertinent history of the writ, and accordingly join his dissent. The important point for me, however, is that the Court should have resolved these cases on other grounds. Habeas is most fundamentally a procedural right, a mechanism for contesting the legality of executive detention. The critical threshold question in these cases, prior to any inquiry about the writ's scope, is whether the system the political branches designed protects whatever rights the detainees may possess. If so, there is no need for any additional process, whether called \"habeas\" or something else.</p>\n<p>Congress entrusted that threshold question in the first instance to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as the Constitution surely allows Congress to do. See Detainee Treatment Act of 2005(DTA), \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(A), 119 Stat. 2742. But before the D.C. Circuit has addressed the issue, the Court cashiers the statute, and without answering this critical threshold question itself. The Court does eventually get around to asking whether review under the DTA is, as the Court frames it, an \"adequate substitute\" for habeas, <i>ante,</i> at 2262, but even <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2280</span> then its opinion fails to determine what rights the detainees possess and whether the DTA system satisfies them. The majority instead compares the undefined DTA process to an equally undefined habeas right\u0097one that is to be given shape only in the future by district courts on a case-by-case basis. This whole approach is misguided.</p>\n<p>It is also fruitless. How the detainees' claims will be decided now that the DTA is gone is anybody's guess. But the habeas process the Court mandates will most likely end up looking a lot like the DTA system it replaces, as the district court judges shaping it will have to reconcile review of the prisoners' detention with the undoubted need to protect the American people from the terrorist threat\u0097precisely the challenge Congress undertook in drafting the DTA. All that today's opinion has done is shift responsibility for those sensitive foreign policy and national security decisions from the elected branches to the Federal Judiciary.</p>\n<p>I believe the system the political branches constructed adequately protects any constitutional rights aliens captured abroad and detained as enemy combatants may enjoy. I therefore would dismiss these cases on that ground. With all respect for the contrary views of the majority, I must dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Court's opinion makes plain that certiorari to review these cases should never have been granted. As two Members of today's majority once recognized, \"traditional rules governing our decision of constitutional questions and our practice of requiring the exhaustion of available remedies... make it appropriate to deny these petitions.\" <i>Boumediene v. Bush,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1725, 1727, 167 L.Ed.2d 757 (2007) (citation omitted) (statement of STEVENS and KENNEDY, JJ., respecting denial of certiorari). Just so. Given the posture in which these cases came to us, the Court should have declined to intervene until the D.C. Circuit had assessed the nature and validity of the congressionally mandated proceedings in a given detainee's case.</p>\n<p>The political branches created a two-part, collateral review procedure for testing the legality of the prisoners' detention: It begins with a hearing before a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) followed by review in the D.C. Circuit. As part of that review, Congress authorized the D.C. Circuit to decide whether the CSRT proceedings are consistent with \"the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742. No petitioner, however, has invoked the D.C. Circuit review the statute specifies. See 476 F.3d 981, 994, and n. 16 (C.A.D.C.2007); Brief for Federal Respondents 41-43. As a consequence, that court has had no occasion to decide whether the CSRT hearings, followed by review in the Court of Appeals, vindicate whatever constitutional and statutory rights petitioners may possess. See 476 F.3d, at 994, and n. 16.</p>\n<p>Remarkably, this Court does not require petitioners to exhaust their remedies under the statute; it does not wait to see whether those remedies will prove sufficient to protect petitioners' rights. Instead, it not only denies the D.C. Circuit the opportunity to assess the statute's remedies, it refuses to do so itself: the majority expressly declines to decide whether the CSRT procedures, coupled with Article III review, satisfy due process. See <i>ante,</i> at 2269.</p>\n<p>It is grossly premature to pronounce on the detainees' right to habeas without first assessing whether the remedies the DTA system provides vindicate whatever rights <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2281</span> petitioners may claim. The plurality in <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,</i> 542 U.S. 507, 533, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004), explained that the Constitution guaranteed an American <i>citizen</i> challenging his detention as an enemy combatant the right to \"notice of the factual basis for his classification, and a fair opportunity to rebut the Government's factual assertions before a neutral decisionmaker.\" The plurality specifically stated that constitutionally adequate collateral process could be provided \"by an appropriately authorized and properly constituted military tribunal,\" given the \"uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 533, 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633. This point is directly pertinent here, for surely the Due Process Clause does not afford <i>non</i>-citizens in such circumstances greater protection than citizens are due.</p>\n<p>If the CSRT procedures meet the minimal due process requirements outlined in <i>Hamdi,</i> and if an Article III court is available to ensure that these procedures are followed in future cases, see <i>id.,</i> at 536, 124 S.Ct. 2633; <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 304, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001); <i>Heikkila v. Barber,</i> 345 U.S. 229, 236, 73 S.Ct. 603, 97 L.Ed. 972 (1953), there is no need to reach the Suspension Clause question. Detainees will have received all the process the Constitution could possibly require, whether that process is called \"habeas\" or something else. The question of the writ's reach need not be addressed.</p>\n<p>This is why the Court should have required petitioners to exhaust their remedies under the statute. As we explained in <i>Gusik v. Schilder,</i> 340 U.S. 128, 132, 71 S.Ct. 149, 95 L.Ed. 146 (1950), \"If an available procedure has not been employed to rectify the alleged error\" petitioners complain of, \"any interference by [a] federal court may be wholly needless. The procedure established to police the errors of the tribunal whose judgment is challenged may be adequate for the occasion.\" Because the majority refuses to assess whether the CSRTs comport with the Constitution, it ends up razing a system of collateral review that it admits may in fact satisfy the Due Process Clause and be \"structurally sound.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2270. But if the collateral review procedures Congress has provided\u0097CSRT review coupled with Article III scrutiny\u0097are sound, interference by a federal habeas court may be entirely unnecessary.</p>\n<p>The only way to know is to require petitioners to use the alternative procedures Congress designed. Mandating that the petitioners exhaust their statutory remedies \"is in no sense a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. It is merely a deferment of resort to the writ until other corrective procedures are shown to be futile.\" <i>Gusik, supra,</i> at 132, 71 S.Ct. 149. So too here, it is not necessary to consider the availability of the writ until the statutory remedies have been shown to be inadequate to protect the detainees' rights. Cf. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A) (\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus ... shall not be granted unless it appears that ... the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State\"). Respect for the judgments of Congress\u0097 whose Members take the same oath we do to uphold the Constitution\u0097requires no less.</p>\n<p>In the absence of any assessment of the DTA's remedies, the question whether detainees are entitled to habeas is an entirely speculative one. Our precedents have long counseled us to avoid deciding such hypothetical questions of constitutional law. See <i>Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin,</i> 323 U.S. 101, 105, 65 S.Ct. 152, 89 L.Ed. 101 (1944) (\"If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2282</span> in the process of constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality ... unless such [questions are] unavoidable\"); see also <i>Ashwander v. TVA,</i> 297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (Constitutional questions should not be decided unless \"`absolutely necessary to a decision of the case'\" (quoting <i>Burton v. United States,</i> 196 U.S. 283, 295, 25 S.Ct. 243, 49 L.Ed. 482 (1905))). This is a \"fundamental rule of judicial restraint.\" <i>Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C.,</i> 467 U.S. 138, 157, 104 S.Ct. 2267, 81 L.Ed.2d 113 (1984).</p>\n<p>The Court acknowledges that \"the ordinary course\" would be not to decide the constitutionality of the DTA at this stage, but abandons that \"ordinary course\" in light of the \"gravity\" of the constitutional issues presented and the prospect of additional delay. <i>Ante,</i> at 2263. It is, however, precisely when the issues presented are grave that adherence to the ordinary course is most important. A principle applied only when unimportant is not much of a principle at all, and charges of judicial activism are most effectively rebutted when courts can fairly argue they are following normal practices.</p>\n<p>The Court is also concerned that requiring petitioners to pursue \"DTA review before proceeding with their habeas corpus actions\" could involve additional delay. <i>Ante,</i> at 2275-2276. The nature of the habeas remedy the Court instructs lower courts to craft on remand, however, is far more unsettled than the process Congress provided in the DTA. See <i>ante,</i> at 2277 (\"[O]ur opinion does not address the content of the law that governs petitioners' detention. That is a matter yet to be determined\"). There is no reason to suppose that review according to procedures the Federal Judiciary will design, case by case, will proceed any faster than the DTA process petitioners disdained.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, the system the Court has launched (and directs lower courts to elaborate) promises to take longer. The Court assures us that before bringing their habeas petitions, detainees must usually complete the CSRT process. See <i>ante,</i> at 2275-2276. Then they may seek review in federal district court. Either success or failure there will surely result in an appeal to the D.C. Circuit\u0097exactly where judicial review <i>starts</i> under Congress's system. The effect of the Court's decision is to add additional layers of quite possibly redundant review. And because nobody knows how these new layers of \"habeas\" review will operate, or what new procedures they will require, their contours will undoubtedly be subject to fresh bouts of litigation. If the majority were truly concerned about delay, it would have required petitioners to use the DTA process that has been available to them for 2 1/2 years, with its Article III review in the D.C. Circuit. That system might well have provided petitioners all the relief to which they are entitled long before the Court's newly installed habeas review could hope to do so.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2283</span> The Court's refusal to require petitioners to exhaust the remedies provided by Congress violates the \"traditional rules governing our decision of constitutional questions.\" <i>Boumediene,</i> 549 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1727 (statement of STEVENS and KENNEDY, JJ., respecting denial of certiorari). The Court's disrespect for these rules makes its decision an awkward business. It rushes to decide the fundamental question of the reach of habeas corpus when the functioning of the DTA may make that decision entirely unnecessary, and it does so with scant idea of how DTA judicial review will actually operate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The majority's overreaching is particularly egregious given the weakness of its objections to the DTA. Simply put, the Court's opinion fails on its own terms. The majority strikes down the statute because it is not an \"adequate substitute\" for habeas review, <i>ante,</i> at 2262, but fails to show what rights the detainees have that cannot be vindicated by the DTA system.</p>\n<p>Because the central purpose of habeas corpus is to test the legality of executive detention, the writ requires most fundamentally an Article III court able to hear the prisoner's claims and, when necessary, order release. See <i>Brown v. Allen,</i> 344 U.S. 443, 533, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring in result). Beyond that, the process a given prisoner is entitled to receive depends on the circumstances and the rights of the prisoner. See <i>Mathews v. Eldridge,</i> 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). After much hemming and hawing, the majority appears to concede that the DTA provides an Article III court competent to order release. See <i>ante,</i> at 2272-2273. The only issue in dispute is the process the Guantanamo prisoners are entitled to use to test the legality of their detention. <i>Hamdi</i> concluded that American citizens detained as enemy combatants are entitled to only limited process, and that much of that process could be supplied by a military tribunal, with review to follow in an Article III court. That is precisely the system we have here. It is adequate to vindicate whatever due process rights petitioners may have.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Court reaches the opposite conclusion partly because it misreads the statute. The majority appears not to understand how the review system it invalidates actually works\u0097specifically, how CSRT review and review by the D.C. Circuit fit together. After briefly acknowledging in its recitation of the facts that the Government designed the CSRTs \"to comply with the due process requirements identified by the plurality in <i>Hamdi,\" ante,</i> at 2241, the Court proceeds to dismiss the tribunal proceedings as no more than a suspect method used by the Executive for determining the status of the detainees in the first instance, see <i>ante,</i> at 2263. This leads the Court to treat the review the DTA provides in the D.C. Circuit as the only opportunity detainees have to challenge their status determination. See <i>ante,</i> at 2266.</p>\n<p>The Court attempts to explain its glancing treatment of the CSRTs by arguing that \"[w]hether one characterizes the CSRT process as direct review of the Executive's battlefield determination ... or as the first step in the collateral review of a battlefield determination makes no difference.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2269. First of all, the majority is quite wrong to dismiss the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2284</span> Executive's determination of detainee status as no more than a \"battlefield\" judgment, as if it were somehow provisional and made in great haste. In fact, detainees are designated \"enemy combatants\" only after \"multiple levels of review by military officers and officials of the Department of Defense.\" Memorandum of the Secretary of the Navy, Implementation of Combatant Status Review Tribunal Procedures for Enemy Combatants Detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (July 29, 2004), App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, p. 150 (hereinafter Implementation Memo).</p>\n<p>The majority is equally wrong to characterize the CSRTs as part of that initial determination process. They are instead a means for detainees to <i>challenge</i> the Government's determination. The Executive designed the CSRTs to mirror Army Regulation 190-8, see Brief for Federal Respondents 48, the very procedural model the plurality in <i>Hamdi</i> said provided the type of process an enemy combatant could expect from a habeas court, see 542 U.S., at 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (plurality opinion). The CSRTs operate much as habeas courts would if hearing the detainee's collateral challenge for the first time: They gather evidence, call witnesses, take testimony, and render a decision on the legality of the Government's detention. See Implementation Memo, App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, at 153-162. If the CSRT finds a particular detainee has been improperly held, it can order release. See <i>id.,</i> at 164.</p>\n<p>The majority insists that even if \"the CSRTs satisf[ied] due process standards,\" full habeas review would still be necessary, because habeas is a collateral remedy available even to prisoners \"detained pursuant to the most rigorous proceedings imaginable.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2269-2270, 2270. This comment makes sense only if the CSRTs are incorrectly viewed as a method used by the Executive for determining the prisoners' status, and not as themselves part of the collateral review to test the validity of that determination. See <i>Gusik,</i> 340 U.S., at 132, 71 S.Ct. 149. The majority can deprecate the importance of the CSRTs only by treating them as something they are not.</p>\n<p>The use of a military tribunal such as the CSRTs to review the aliens' detention should be familiar to this Court in light of the <i>Hamdi</i> plurality, which said that the due process rights enjoyed by <i>American citizens</i> detained as enemy combatants could be vindicated \"by an appropriately authorized and properly constituted military tribunal.\" 542 U.S., at 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633. The DTA represents Congress' considered attempt to provide the accused alien combatants detained at Guantanamo a constitutionally adequate opportunity to contest their detentions before just such a tribunal.</p>\n<p>But Congress went further in the DTA. CSRT review is just the first tier of collateral review in the DTA system. The statute provides additional review in an Article III court. Given the rationale of today's decision, it is well worth recalling exactly what the DTA provides in this respect. The statute directs the D.C. Circuit to consider whether a particular alien's status determination \"was consistent with the standards and procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense\" <i>and</i> \"whether the use of such standards and procedures to make the determination is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742. That is, a <i>court</i> determines whether the CSRT procedures are constitutional, and a <i>court</i> determines whether those procedures were followed in a particular case.</p>\n<p>In short, the <i>Hamdi</i> plurality concluded that this type of review would be enough <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2285</span> to satisfy due process, even for citizens. See 542 U.S., at 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633. Congress followed the Court's lead, only to find itself the victim of a constitutional bait and switch.</p>\n<p><i>Hamdi</i> merits scant attention from the Court\u0097a remarkable omission, as <i>Hamdi</i> bears directly on the issues before us. The majority attempts to dismiss <i>Hamdi'</i>s relevance by arguing that because the availability of \u00a7 2241 federal habeas was never in doubt in that case, \"the Court had no occasion to define the necessary scope of habeas review ... in the context of enemy combatant detentions.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2269. Hardly. <i>Hamdi</i> was all about the scope of habeas review in the context of enemy combatant detentions. The petitioner, an American citizen held within the United States as an enemy combatant, invoked the writ to challenge his detention. 542 U.S., at 510-511, 124 S.Ct. 2633. After \"a careful examination both of the writ... and of the Due Process Clause,\" this Court enunciated the \"basic process\" the Constitution entitled Hamdi to expect from a habeas court under \u00a7 2241. <i>Id.,</i> at 525, 534, 124 S.Ct. 2633. That process consisted of the right to \"receive notice of the factual basis for his classification, and a fair opportunity to rebut the Government's factual assertions before a neutral decisionmaker.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 533, 124 S.Ct. 2633. In light of the Government's national security responsibilities, the plurality found the process could be \"tailored to alleviate [the] uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.\" <i>Ibid.</i> For example, the Government could rely on hearsay and could claim a presumption in favor of its own evidence. See <i>id.,</i> at 533-534, 124 S.Ct. 2633.</p>\n<p><i>Hamdi</i> further suggested that this \"basic process\" on collateral review could be provided by a military tribunal. It pointed to prisoner-of-war tribunals as a model that would satisfy the Constitution's requirements. See <i>id.,</i> at 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633. Only \"[i]n the <i>absence</i> of such process\" before a military tribunal, the Court held, would Article III courts need to conduct full-dress habeas proceedings to \"ensure that the minimum requirements of due process are achieved.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). And even then, the petitioner would be entitled to no more process than he would have received from a properly constituted military review panel, given his limited due process rights and the Government's weighty interests. See <i>id.,</i> at 533-534, 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the majority, <i>Hamdi</i> is of pressing relevance because it establishes the procedures American <i>citizens</i> detained as enemy combatants can expect from a habeas court proceeding under \u00a7 2241. The DTA system of military tribunal hearings followed by Article III review looks a lot like the procedure <i>Hamdi</i> blessed. If nothing else, it is plain from the design of the DTA that Congress, the President, and this Nation's military leaders have made a good-faith effort to follow our precedent.</p>\n<p>The Court, however, will not take \"yes\" for an answer. The majority contends that \"[i]f Congress had envisioned DTA review as coextensive with traditional habeas corpus,\" it would have granted the D.C. Circuit far broader review authority. <i>Ante,</i> at 2265. Maybe so, but that comment reveals the majority's misunderstanding. \"[T]raditional habeas corpus\" takes <i>no</i> account of what <i>Hamdi</i> recognized as the \"uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.\" 542 U.S., at 533, 124 S.Ct. 2633. Besides, Congress and the Executive did not envision \"DTA review\"\u0097by which I assume the Court means D.C. Circuit review, see <i>ante,</i> at 2265-2266\u0097as the detainees' only opportunity to challenge their detentions. Instead, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2286</span> the political branches crafted CSRT <i>and</i> D.C. Circuit review to operate together, with the goal of providing noncitizen detainees the level of collateral process <i>Hamdi</i> said would satisfy the due process rights of American citizens. See Brief for Federal Respondents 48-53.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Given the statutory scheme the political branches adopted, and given <i>Hamdi,</i> it simply will not do for the majority to dismiss the CSRT procedures as \"far more limited\" than those used in military trials, and therefore beneath the level of process \"that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2260. The question is not how much process the CSRTs provide in comparison to other modes of adjudication. The question is whether the CSRT procedures\u0097coupled with the judicial review specified by the DTA\u0097provide the \"basic process\" <i>Hamdi</i> said the Constitution affords American citizens detained as enemy combatants. See 542 U.S., at 534, 124 S.Ct. 2633.</p>\n<p>By virtue of its refusal to allow the D.C. Circuit to assess petitioners' statutory remedies, and by virtue of its own refusal to consider, at the outset, the fit between those remedies and due process, the majority now finds itself in the position of evaluating whether the DTA system is an adequate substitute for habeas review without knowing what rights either habeas or the DTA is supposed to protect. The majority attempts to elide this problem by holding that petitioners have a right to habeas corpus and then comparing the DTA against the \"historic office\" of the writ. <i>Ante,</i> at 2265. But habeas is, as the majority acknowledges, a flexible remedy rather than a substantive right. Its \"precise application ... change[s] depending upon the circumstances.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2267. The shape of habeas review ultimately depends on the nature of the rights a petitioner may assert. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Reid v. Covert,</i> 354 U.S. 1, 75, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in result) (\"[T]he question of which specific safeguards of the Constitution are appropriately to be applied in a particular context ... can be reduced to the issue of what process is `due' a defendant in the particular circumstances of a particular case\").</p>\n<p>The scope of federal habeas review is traditionally more limited in some contexts than in others, depending on the status of the detainee and the rights he may assert. See <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S., at 306, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (\"In [immigration cases], other than the question whether there was some evidence to support the [deportation] order, the courts generally did not review factual determinations made by the Executive\" (footnote omitted)); <i>Burns v. Wilson,</i> 346 U.S. 137, 139, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953) (plurality opinion) (\"[I]n military habeas corpus the inquiry, the scope of matters open for review, has always been more narrow than in civil cases\"); <i>In re Yamashita,</i> 327 U.S. 1, 8, 66 S.Ct. 340, 90 L.Ed. 499 (1946) (\"The courts may inquire whether the detention complained of is within the authority of those detaining the petitioner. If the military tribunals have lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn, their action is not subject to judicial review\"); <i>Ex parte Quirin,</i> 317 U.S. 1, 25, 63 S.Ct. 2, 87 L.Ed. 3 (1942) (federal habeas review of military commission verdict limited to determining commission's jurisdiction).</p>\n<p>Declaring that petitioners have a right to habeas in no way excuses the Court from explaining why the DTA does not protect whatever due process or statutory rights petitioners may have. Because if the DTA provides a means for vindicating petitioners' rights, it is necessarily an adequate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2287</span> substitute for habeas corpus. See <i>Swain v. Pressley,</i> 430 U.S. 372, 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977); <i>United States v. Hayman,</i> 342 U.S. 205, 223, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952).</p>\n<p>For my part, I will assume that any due process rights petitioners may possess are no greater than those of American citizens detained as enemy combatants. It is worth noting again that the <i>Hamdi</i> controlling opinion said the Constitution guarantees citizen detainees only \"basic\" procedural rights, and that the process for securing those rights can \"be tailored to alleviate [the] uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.\" 542 U.S., at 533, 124 S.Ct. 2633. The majority, however, objects that \"the procedural protections afforded to the detainees in the CSRT hearings are ... limited.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2260. But the evidentiary and other limitations the Court complains of reflect the nature of the issue in contest, namely, the status of aliens captured by our Armed Forces abroad and alleged to be enemy combatants. Contrary to the repeated suggestions of the majority, DTA review need not parallel the habeas privileges enjoyed by noncombatant American citizens, as set out in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000 ed. and Supp V). Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 2264-2265. It need only provide process adequate for noncitizens detained as alleged combatants.</p>\n<p>To what basic process are these detainees due as habeas petitioners? We have said that \"at the absolute minimum,\" the Suspension Clause protects the writ \"`as it existed in 1789.'\" <i>St. Cyr, supra,</i> at 301, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (quoting <i>Felker v. Turpin,</i> 518 U.S. 651, 663-664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996)). The majority admits that a number of historical authorities suggest that at the time of the Constitution's ratification, \"common-law courts abstained altogether from matters involving prisoners of war.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2248. If this is accurate, the process provided prisoners under the DTA is plainly more than sufficient\u0097it allows alleged combatants to challenge both the factual and legal bases of their detentions.</p>\n<p>Assuming the constitutional baseline is more robust, the DTA still provides adequate process, and by the majority's own standards. Today's Court opines that the Suspension Clause guarantees prisoners such as the detainees \"a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that [they are] being held pursuant to the erroneous application or interpretation of relevant law.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2266 (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, the Court holds that to be an adequate substitute, any tribunal reviewing the detainees' cases \"must have the power to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully detained.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The DTA system\u0097CSRT review of the Executive's determination followed by D.C. Circuit review for sufficiency of the evidence and the constitutionality of the CSRT process\u0097meets these criteria.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>At the CSRT stage, every petitioner has the right to present evidence that he has been wrongfully detained. This includes the right to call witnesses who are reasonably available, question witnesses called by the tribunal, introduce documentary evidence, and testify before the tribunal. See Implementation Memo, App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, at 154-156, 158-159, 161.</p>\n<p>While the Court concedes detainees may confront all witnesses called before the tribunal, it suggests this right is \"more theoretical than real\" because \"there are in effect no limits on the admission of hearsay evidence.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2269. The Court further complains that petitioners lack <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2288</span> \"the assistance of counsel,\" and\u0097given the limits on their access to classified information\u0097\"may not be aware of the most critical allegations\" against them. <i>Ante,</i> at 2269. None of these complaints is persuasive.</p>\n<p>Detainees not only have the opportunity to confront any witness who appears before the tribunal, they may call witnesses of their own. The Implementation Memo requires only that detainees' witnesses be \"reasonably available,\" App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, at 155, a requirement drawn from Army Regulation 190-8, ch. 1, \u00a7 1-6(<i>e</i> )(6), and entirely consistent with the Government's interest in avoiding \"a futile search for evidence\" that might burden warmaking responsibilities, <i>Hamdi, supra,</i> at 532, 124 S.Ct. 2633. The dangerous mission assigned to our forces abroad is to fight terrorists, not serve subpoenas. The Court is correct that some forms of hearsay evidence are admissible before the CSRT, but <i>Hamdi</i> expressly approved this use of hearsay by habeas courts. 542 U.S., at 533-534, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (\"Hearsay, for example, may need to be accepted as the most reliable available evidence from the Government\").</p>\n<p>As to classified information, while detainees are not permitted access to it themselves, the Implementation Memo provides each detainee with a \"Personal Representative\" who may review classified documents at the CSRT stage and summarize them for the detainee. Implementation Memo, <i>supra,</i> at 152, 154-155, 156; Brief for Federal Respondents 54-55. The prisoner's counsel enjoys the same privilege on appeal before the D.C. Circuit. That is more access to classified material for alleged alien enemy combatants than ever before provided. I am not aware of a single instance\u0097and certainly the majority cites none\u0097in which detainees such as petitioners have been provided access to classified material in <i>any</i> form. Indeed, prisoners of war who challenge their status determinations under the Geneva Convention are afforded no such access, see Army Regulation 190-8, ch. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1-6(<i>e</i>)(3) and (5), and the prisoner-of-war model is the one <i>Hamdi</i> cited as consistent with the demands of due process for <i>citizens,</i> see 542 U.S., at 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633.</p>\n<p>What alternative does the Court propose? Allow free access to classified information and ignore the risk the prisoner may eventually convey what he learns to parties hostile to this country, with deadly consequences for those who helped apprehend the detainee? If the Court can design a better system for communicating to detainees the substance of any classified information relevant to their cases, without fatally compromising national security interests and sources, the majority should come forward with it. Instead, the majority fobs that vexing question off on district courts to answer down the road.</p>\n<p>Prisoners of war are not permitted access to classified information, and neither are they permitted access to counsel, another supposed failing of the CSRT process. And yet the Guantanamo detainees are hardly denied all legal assistance. They are provided a \"Personal Representative\" who, as previously noted, may access classified information, help the detainee arrange for witnesses, assist the detainee's preparation of his case, and even aid the detainee in presenting his evidence to the tribunal. See Implementation Memo, <i>supra,</i> at 161. The provision for a personal representative on this order is one of several ways in which the CSRT procedures are <i>more</i> generous than those provided prisoners of war under Army Regulation 190-8.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that all this is just at the CSRT stage. Detainees receive additional process before the D.C. Circuit, including <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2289</span> full access to appellate counsel and the right to challenge the factual and legal bases of their detentions. DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C) empowers the Court of Appeals to determine not only whether the CSRT observed the \"procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense,\" but also \"whether the use of such standards and procedures ... is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" 119 Stat. 2742. These provisions permit detainees to dispute the sufficiency of the evidence against them. They allow detainees to challenge a CSRT panel's interpretation of any relevant law, and even the constitutionality of the CSRT proceedings themselves. This includes, as the Solicitor General acknowledges, the ability to dispute the Government's right to detain alleged combatants in the first place, and to dispute the Government's definition of \"enemy combatant.\" Brief for Federal Respondents 59. All this before an Article III court\u0097plainly a neutral decisionmaker.</p>\n<p>All told, the DTA provides the prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay adequate opportunity to contest the bases of their detentions, which is all habeas corpus need allow. The DTA provides more opportunity and more process, in fact, than that afforded prisoners of war or any other alleged enemy combatants in history.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>Despite these guarantees, the Court finds the DTA system an inadequate habeas substitute, for one central reason: Detainees are unable to introduce at the appeal stage exculpatory evidence discovered after the conclusion of their CSRT proceedings. See <i>ante,</i> at 2271. The Court hints darkly that the DTA may suffer from other infirmities, see <i>ante,</i> at 2274 (\"We do not imply DTA review would be a constitutionally sufficient replacement for habeas corpus but for these limitations on the detainee's ability to present exculpatory evidence\"), but it does not bother to name them, making a response a bit difficult. As it stands, I can only assume the Court regards the supposed defect it did identify as the gravest of the lot.</p>\n<p>If this is the most the Court can muster, the ice beneath its feet is thin indeed. As noted, the CSRT procedures provide ample opportunity for detainees to introduce exculpatory evidence\u0097whether documentary in nature or from live witnesses\u0097before the military tribunals. See <i>infra,</i> at 2289-2291; Implementation Memo, App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-196, at 155-156. And if their ability to introduce such evidence is denied contrary to the Constitution or laws of the United States, the D.C. Circuit has the authority to say so on review.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Court asks us to imagine an instance in which evidence is discovered <i>after</i> the CSRT panel renders its decision, but <i>before</i> the Court of Appeals reviews the detainee's case. This scenario, which of course has not yet come to pass as no review in the D.C. Circuit has occurred, provides no basis for rejecting the DTA as a habeas substitute. While the majority is correct that the DTA does not contemplate the introduction of \"newly discovered\" evidence before the Court of Appeals, petitioners and the Solicitor General agree that the DTA <i>does</i> permit the D.C. Circuit to remand a detainee's case for a new CSRT determination. Brief for Petitioner Boumediene et al. in No. 06-1195, at 30; Brief for Federal Respondents 60-61. In the event a detainee alleges that he has obtained new and persuasive exculpatory evidence that would have been considered by the tribunal below had it only been available, the D.C. Circuit could readily remand the case to the tribunal to allow that body to consider the evidence in the first instance. The Court of Appeals could <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2290</span> later review any new or reinstated decision in light of the supplemented record.</p>\n<p>If that sort of procedure sounds familiar, it should. Federal appellate courts reviewing factual determinations follow just such a procedure in a variety of circumstances. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. White,</i> 492 F.3d 380, 413 (C.A.6 2007) (remanding new-evidence claim to the district court for a <i>Brady</i> evidentiary hearing); <i>Avila v. Roe,</i> 298 F.3d 750, 754 (C.A.9 2002) (remanding habeas claim to the district court for evidentiary hearing to clarify factual record); <i>United States v. Leone,</i> 215 F.3d 253, 256 (C.A.2 2000) (observing that when faced on direct appeal with an underdeveloped claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, the appellate court may remand to the district court for necessary factfinding).</p>\n<p>A remand is not the only relief available for detainees caught in the Court's hypothetical conundrum. The DTA expressly directs the Secretary of Defense to \"provide for periodic review of any new evidence that may become available relating to the enemy combatant status of a detainee.\" DTA \u00a7 1005(a)(3). Regulations issued by the Department of Defense provide that when a detainee puts forward new, material evidence \"not previously presented to the detainee's CSRT,\" the Deputy Secretary of Defense \"`will direct that a CSRT convene to reconsider the basis of the detainee's ... status in light of the new information.'\" Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants, Instruction 5421.1, Procedure for Review of \"New Evidence\" Relating to Enemy Combatant (EC) Status \u00b6\u00b6 4(a)(1), 5(b) (May 7, 2007); Brief for Federal Respondents 56, n. 30. Pursuant to DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(A), the resulting CSRT determination is again reviewable in full by the D.C. Circuit.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition, DTA \u00a7 1005(d)(1) further requires the Department of Defense to conduct a yearly review of the status of each prisoner. See 119 Stat. 2741. The Deputy Secretary of Defense has promulgated concomitant regulations establishing an Administrative Review Board to assess \"annually the need to continue to detain each enemy combatant.\" Deputy Secretary of Defense Order OSD 06942-04 (May 11, 2004), App. K to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, p. 189. In the words of the implementing order, the purpose of this annual review is to afford every detainee the opportunity \"to explain why he is no longer a threat to the United States\" and should be released. <i>Ibid.</i> The Board's findings are forwarded to a presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed civilian within the Department of Defense whom the Secretary of Defense has designated to administer the review process. This designated civilian official has the authority to order release upon the Board's recommendation. <i>Id.,</i> at 201.</p>\n<p>The Court's hand wringing over the DTA's treatment of later-discovered exculpatory evidence is the most it has to show after a roving search for constitutionally problematic scenarios. But \"[t]he delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional,\" we have said, \"is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.\" <i>United States v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2291</span> <i>Raines,</i> 362 U.S. 17, 22, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960). The Court today invents a sort of reverse facial challenge and applies it with gusto: If there is <i>any</i> scenario in which the statute <i>might</i> be constitutionally infirm, the law must be struck down. Cf. <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987) (\"A facial challenge ... must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid\"); see also <i>Washington v. Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S. 702, 739-740, and n. 7, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgments) (facial challenge must fail where the statute has \"`plainly legitimate sweep'\" (quoting <i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</i> 413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973))). The Court's new method of constitutional adjudication only underscores its failure to follow our usual procedures and require petitioners to demonstrate that <i>they</i> have been harmed by the statute they challenge. In the absence of such a concrete showing, the Court is unable to imagine a plausible hypothetical in which the DTA is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E</h2>\n<p>The Court's second criterion for an adequate substitute is the \"power to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully detained.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2266. As the Court basically admits, the DTA can be read to permit the D.C. Circuit to order release in light of our traditional principles of construing statutes to avoid difficult constitutional issues, when reasonably possible. See <i>ante,</i> at 2270-2271.</p>\n<p>The Solicitor General concedes that remedial authority of some sort must be implied in the statute, given that the DTA \u0097 like the general habeas law itself, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243 \u0097 provides no express remedy of any kind. Brief for Federal Respondents 60-61. The parties agree that at the least, the DTA empowers the D.C. Circuit to remand a prisoner's case to the CSRT with instructions to perform a new status assessment. Brief for Petitioner Boumediene et al. in No. 06-1195, at 30; Brief for Federal Respondents 60-61. To avoid constitutional infirmity, it is reasonable to imply more, see <i>Ashwander,</i> 297 U.S., at 348, 56 S.Ct. 466 (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\"When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question ... it is a cardinal principle that this Court will... ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the [constitutional] question may be avoided\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S., at 299-300, 121 S.Ct. 2271, especially in view of the Solicitor General's concession at oral argument and in his Supplemental Brief that authority to release might be read in the statute, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 37; Supplemental Brief for Federal Respondents 9.</p>\n<p>The Court grudgingly suggests that \"Congress' silence on the question of remedies suggests acquiescence to any constitutionally required remedy.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2271. But the argument in favor of statutorily authorized release is stronger than that. The DTA's parallels to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243 on this score are noteworthy. By way of remedy, the general federal habeas statute provides only that the court, having heard and determined the facts, shall \"dispose of the matter as law and justice require.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We have long held, and no party here disputes, that this includes the power to order release. See <i>Wilkinson v. Dotson,</i> 544 U.S. 74, 79, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005) (\"[T]he writ's history makes clear that it traditionally has been accepted as the specific instrument to obtain release from [unlawful] confinement\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2292</span> The DTA can be similarly read. Because Congress substituted DTA review for habeas corpus and because the \"unique purpose\" of the writ is \"to release the applicant ... from unlawful confinement,\" <i>Allen v. McCurry,</i> 449 U.S. 90, 98, n. 12, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980), DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2) can and should be read to confer on the Court of Appeals the authority to order release in appropriate circumstances. Section 1005(e)(2)(D) plainly contemplates release, addressing the effect \"release of [an] alien from the custody of the Department of Defense\" will have on the jurisdiction of the court. 119 Stat. 2742-2743. This reading avoids serious constitutional difficulty and is consistent with the text of the statute.</p>\n<p>The D.C. Circuit can thus order release, the CSRTs can order release, and the head of the Administrative Review Boards can, at the recommendation of those panels, order release. These multiple release provisions within the DTA system more than satisfy the majority's requirement that any tribunal substituting for a habeas court have the authority to release the prisoner.</p>\n<p>The basis for the Court's contrary conclusion is summed up in the following sentence near the end of its opinion: \"To hold that the detainees at Guantanamo may, under the DTA, challenge the President's legal authority to detain them, contest the CSRT's findings of fact, supplement the record on review with newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence, and request an order of release would come close to reinstating the \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus process Congress sought to deny them.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2271. In other words, any interpretation of the statute that would make it an adequate substitute for habeas must be rejected, because Congress could not possibly have intended to enact an adequate substitute for habeas. The Court could have saved itself a lot of trouble if it had simply announced this Catch-22 approach at the beginning rather than the end of its opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>For all its eloquence about the detainees' right to the writ, the Court makes no effort to elaborate how exactly the remedy it prescribes will differ from the procedural protections detainees enjoy under the DTA. The Court objects to the detainees' limited access to witnesses and classified material, but proposes no alternatives of its own. Indeed, it simply ignores the many difficult questions its holding presents. What, for example, will become of the CSRT process? The majority says federal courts should <i>generally</i> refrain from entertaining detainee challenges until after the petitioner's CSRT proceeding has finished. See <i>ante,</i> at 2275-2276 (\"[e]xcept in cases of undue delay\"). But to what deference, if any, is that CSRT determination entitled?</p>\n<p>There are other problems. Take witness availability. What makes the majority think witnesses will become magically available when the review procedure is labeled \"habeas\"? Will the location of most of these witnesses change \u0097 will they suddenly become easily susceptible to service of process? Or will subpoenas issued by American habeas courts run to Basra? And if they did, how would they be enforced? Speaking of witnesses, will detainees be able to call active-duty military officers as witnesses? If not, why not?</p>\n<p>The majority has no answers for these difficulties. What it does say leaves open the distinct possibility that its \"habeas\" remedy will, when all is said and done, end up looking a great deal like the DTA review it rejects. See <i>ante,</i> at 2275-2276 (opinion of the court) (\"We recognize, however, that the Government has a legitimate interest in protecting sources and methods <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2293</span> of intelligence gathering, and we expect that the District Court will use its discretion to accommodate this interest to the greatest extent possible\"). But \"[t]he role of the judiciary is limited to determining whether the procedures meet the essential standard of fairness under the Due Process Clause and does not extend to imposing procedures that merely displace congressional choices of policy.\" <i>Landon v. Plasencia,</i> 459 U.S. 21, 34-35, 103 S.Ct. 321, 74 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982).</p>\n<p>The majority rests its decision on abstract and hypothetical concerns. Step back and consider what, in the real world, Congress and the Executive have actually granted aliens captured by our Armed Forces overseas and found to be enemy combatants:</p>\n<blockquote>\u0095 The right to hear the bases of the charges against them, including a summary of any classified evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u0095 The ability to challenge the bases of their detention before military tribunals modeled after Geneva Convention procedures. Some 38 detainees have been released as a result of this process. Brief for Federal Respondents 57, 60.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u0095 The right, before the CSRT, to testify, introduce evidence, call witnesses, question those the Government calls, and secure release, if and when appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u0095 The right to the aid of a personal representative in arranging and presenting their cases before a CSRT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u0095 Before the D.C. Circuit, the right to employ counsel, challenge the factual record, contest the lower tribunal's legal determinations, ensure compliance with the Constitution and laws, and secure release, if any errors below establish their entitlement to such relief.</blockquote>\n<p>In sum, the DTA satisfies the majority's own criteria for assessing adequacy. This statutory scheme provides the combatants held at Guantanamo greater procedural protections than have ever been afforded alleged enemy detainees \u0097 whether citizens or aliens \u0097 in our national history.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>So who has won? Not the detainees. The Court's analysis leaves them with only the prospect of further litigation to determine the content of their new habeas right, followed by further litigation to resolve their particular cases, followed by further litigation before the D.C. Circuit \u0097 where they could have started had they invoked the DTA procedure. Not Congress, whose attempt to \"determine \u0097 through democratic means \u0097 how best\" to balance the security of the American people with the detainees' liberty interests, see <i>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld,</i> 548 U.S. 557, 636, 126 S.Ct. 2749, 165 L.Ed.2d 723 (2006) (BREYER, J., concurring), has been unceremoniously brushed aside. Not the Great Writ, whose majesty is hardly enhanced by its extension to a jurisdictionally quirky outpost, with no tangible benefit to anyone. Not the rule of law, unless by that is meant the rule of lawyers, who will now arguably have a greater role than military and intelligence officials in shaping policy for alien enemy combatants. And certainly not the American people, who today lose a bit more control over the conduct of this Nation's foreign policy to unelected, politically unaccountable judges.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Today, for the first time in our Nation's history, the Court confers a constitutional right to habeas corpus on alien enemies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2294</span> detained abroad by our military forces in the course of an ongoing war. THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent, which I join, shows that the procedures prescribed by Congress in the Detainee Treatment Act provide the essential protections that habeas corpus guarantees; there has thus been no suspension of the writ, and no basis exists for judicial intervention beyond what the Act allows. My problem with today's opinion is more fundamental still: The writ of habeas corpus does not, and never has, run in favor of aliens abroad; the Suspension Clause thus has no application, and the Court's intervention in this military matter is entirely <i>ultra vires.</i></p>\n<p>I shall devote most of what will be a lengthy opinion to the legal errors contained in the opinion of the Court. Contrary to my usual practice, however, I think it appropriate to begin with a description of the disastrous consequences of what the Court has done today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>America is at war with radical Islamists. The enemy began by killing Americans and American allies abroad: 241 at the Marine barracks in Lebanon, 19 at the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, 224 at our embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, and 17 on the USS Cole in Yemen. See National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, The 9/11 Commission Report, pp. 60-61, 70, 190 (2004). On September 11, 2001, the enemy brought the battle to American soil, killing 2,749 at the Twin Towers in New York City, 184 at the Pentagon in Washington, D. C., and 40 in Pennsylvania. See <i>id.,</i> at 552, n. 9. It has threatened further attacks against our homeland; one need only walk about buttressed and barricaded Washington, or board a plane anywhere in the country, to know that the threat is a serious one. Our Armed Forces are now in the field against the enemy, in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last week, 13 of our countrymen in arms were killed.</p>\n<p>The game of bait-and-switch that today's opinion plays upon the Nation's Commander in Chief will make the war harder on us. It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed. That consequence would be tolerable if necessary to preserve a time-honored legal principle vital to our constitutional Republic. But it is this Court's blatant <i>abandonment</i> of such a principle that produces the decision today. The President relied on our settled precedent in <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager,</i> 339 U.S. 763, 70 S.Ct. 936, 94 L.Ed. 1255 (1950), when he established the prison at Guantanamo Bay for enemy aliens. Citing that case, the President's Office of Legal Counsel advised him \"that the great weight of legal authority indicates that a federal district court could not properly exercise habeas jurisdiction over an alien detained at [Guantanamo Bay].\" Memorandum from Patrick F. Philbin and John C. Yoo, Deputy Assistant Attorneys General, Office of Legal Counsel, to William J. Haynes II, General Counsel, Dept. of Defense (Dec. 28, 2001). Had the law been otherwise, the military surely would not have transported prisoners there, but would have kept them in Afghanistan, transferred them to another of our foreign military bases, or turned them over to allies for detention. Those other facilities might well have been worse for the detainees themselves.</p>\n<p>In the long term, then, the Court's decision today accomplishes little, except perhaps to reduce the well-being of enemy combatants that the Court ostensibly seeks to protect. In the short term, however, the decision is devastating. At least 30 of those prisoners hitherto released from Guantanamo Bay have returned to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2295</span> the battlefield. See S.Rep. No. 110-90, pt. 7, p. 13 (2007) (Minority Views of Sens. Kyl, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, and Coburn) (hereinafter Minority Report). Some have been captured or killed. See <i>ibid.;</i> see also Mintz, Released Detainees Rejoining the Fight, Washington Post, Oct. 22, 2004, pp. A1, A12. But others have succeeded in carrying on their atrocities against innocent civilians. In one case, a detainee released from Guantanamo Bay masterminded the kidnapping of two Chinese dam workers, one of whom was later shot to death when used as a human shield against Pakistani commandoes. See Khan &amp; Lancaster, Pakistanis Rescue Hostage; 2nd Dies, Washington Post, Oct. 15, 2004, p. A18. Another former detainee promptly resumed his post as a senior Taliban commander and murdered a United Nations engineer and three Afghan soldiers. Mintz, <i>supra.</i> Still another murdered an Afghan judge. See Minority Report 13. It was reported only last month that a released detainee carried out a suicide bombing against Iraqi soldiers in Mosul, Iraq. See White, Ex-Guantanamo Detainee Joined Iraq Suicide Attack, Washington Post, May 8, 2008, p. A18.</p>\n<p>These, mind you, were detainees whom <i>the military</i> had concluded were not enemy combatants. Their return to the kill illustrates the incredible difficulty of assessing who is and who is not an enemy combatant in a foreign theater of operations where the environment does not lend itself to rigorous evidence collection. Astoundingly, the Court today raises the bar, requiring military officials to appear before civilian courts and defend their decisions under procedural and evidentiary rules that go beyond what Congress has specified. As THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent makes clear, we have no idea what those procedural and evidentiary rules are, but they will be determined by civil courts and (in the Court's contemplation at least) will be more detainee-friendly than those now applied, since otherwise there would no reason to hold the congressionally prescribed procedures unconstitutional. If they impose a higher standard of proof (from foreign battlefields) than the current procedures require, the number of the enemy returned to combat will obviously increase.</p>\n<p>But even when the military has evidence that it can bring forward, it is often foolhardy to release that evidence to the attorneys representing our enemies. And one escalation of procedures that the Court <i>is</i> clear about is affording the detainees increased access to witnesses (perhaps troops serving in Afghanistan?) and to classified information. See <i>ante,</i> at 2269-2270. During the 1995 prosecution of Omar Abdel Rahman, federal prosecutors gave the names of 200 unindicted co-conspirators to the \"Blind Sheik's\" defense lawyers; that information was in the hands of Osama Bin Laden within two weeks. See Minority Report 14-15. In another case, trial testimony revealed to the enemy that the United States had been monitoring their cellular network, whereupon they promptly stopped using it, enabling more of them to evade capture and continue their atrocities. See <i>id.,</i> at 15.</p>\n<p>And today it is not just the military that the Court elbows aside. A mere two Terms ago in <i>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld,</i> 548 U.S. 557, 126 S.Ct. 2749, 165 L.Ed.2d 723 (2006), when the Court held (quite amazingly) that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 had not stripped habeas jurisdiction over Guantanamo petitioners' claims, four Members of today's five-Justice majority joined an opinion saying the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Nothing prevents the President from returning to Congress to seek the authority [for trial by military commission] he believes necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2296</span> \"Where, as here, no emergency prevents consultation with Congress, judicial insistence upon that consultation does not weaken our Nation's ability to deal with danger. To the contrary, that insistence strengthens the Nation's ability to determine \u0097 through democratic means \u0097 how best to do so. The Constitution places its faith in those democratic means.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 636, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (BREYER, J., concurring).<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Turns out they were just kidding. For in response, Congress, at the President's request, quickly enacted the Military Commissions Act, emphatically reasserting that it did not want these prisoners filing habeas petitions. It is therefore clear that Congress and the Executive \u0097 <i>both</i> political branches \u0097 have determined that limiting the role of civilian courts in adjudicating whether prisoners captured abroad are properly detained is important to success in the war that some 190,000 of our men and women are now fighting. As the Solicitor General argued, \"the Military Commissions Act and the Detainee Treatment Act ... represent an effort by the political branches to strike an appropriate balance between the need to preserve liberty and the need to accommodate the weighty and sensitive governmental interests in ensuring that those who have in fact fought with the enemy during a war do not return to battle against the United States.\" Brief for Respondents 10-11 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>But it does not matter. The Court today decrees that no good reason to accept the judgment of the other two branches is \"apparent.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2261. \"The Government,\" it declares, \"presents no credible arguments that the military mission at Guantanamo would be compromised if habeas corpus courts had jurisdiction to hear the detainees' claims.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 2260-2261. What competence does the Court have to second-guess the judgment of Congress and the President on such a point? None whatever. But the Court blunders in nonetheless. Henceforth, as today's opinion makes unnervingly clear, how to handle enemy prisoners in this war will ultimately lie with the branch that knows least about the national security concerns that the subject entails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Suspension Clause of the Constitution provides: \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. As a court of law operating under a written Constitution, our role is to determine whether there is a conflict between that Clause and the Military Commissions Act. A conflict arises only if the Suspension Clause preserves the privilege of the writ for aliens held by the United States military as enemy combatants at the base in Guantanamo Bay, located within the sovereign territory of Cuba.</p>\n<p>We have frequently stated that we owe great deference to Congress's view that a law it has passed is constitutional. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Department of Labor v. Triplett,</i> 494 U.S. 715, 721, 110 S.Ct. 1428, 108 L.Ed.2d 701 (1990); <i>United States v. National</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2297</span> <i>Dairy Products Corp.,</i> 372 U.S. 29, 32, 83 S.Ct. 594, 9 L.Ed.2d 561 (1963); see also <i>American Communications Assn. v. Douds,</i> 339 U.S. 382, 435, 70 S.Ct. 674, 94 L.Ed. 925 (1950) (Jackson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). That is especially so in the area of foreign and military affairs; \"perhaps in no other area has the Court accorded Congress greater deference.\" <i>Rostker v. Goldberg,</i> 453 U.S. 57, 64-65, 101 S.Ct. 2646, 69 L.Ed.2d 478 (1981). Indeed, we accord great deference even when the President acts alone in this area. See <i>Department of Navy v. Egan,</i> 484 U.S. 518, 529-530, 108 S.Ct. 818, 98 L.Ed.2d 918 (1988); <i>Regan v. Wald,</i> 468 U.S. 222, 243, 104 S.Ct. 3026, 82 L.Ed.2d 171 (1984).</p>\n<p>In light of those principles of deference, the Court's conclusion that \"the common law [does not] yiel[d] a definite answer to the questions before us,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2251, leaves it no choice but to affirm the Court of Appeals. The writ as preserved in the Constitution could not possibly extend farther than the common law provided when that Clause was written. See Part III, <i>infra.</i> The Court admits that it cannot determine whether the writ historically extended to aliens held abroad, and it concedes (necessarily) that Guantanamo Bay lies outside the sovereign territory of the United States. See <i>ante,</i> at 2251-2252; <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> 542 U.S. 466, 500-501, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Together, these two concessions establish that it is (in the Court's view) perfectly ambiguous whether the common-law writ would have provided a remedy for these petitioners. If that is so, the Court has no basis to strike down the Military Commissions Act, and must leave undisturbed the considered judgment of the coequal branches.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>How, then, does the Court weave a clear constitutional prohibition out of pure interpretive equipoise? The Court resorts to \"fundamental separation-of-powers principles\" to interpret the Suspension Clause. <i>Ante,</i> at 2253. According to the Court, because \"the writ of habeas corpus is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers,\" the test of its extraterritorial reach \"must not be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to restrain.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2259.</p>\n<p>That approach distorts the nature of the separation of powers and its role in the constitutional structure. The \"fundamental separation-of-powers principles\" that the Constitution embodies are to be derived not from some judicially imagined matrix, but from the sum total of the individual separation-of-powers provisions that the Constitution sets forth. Only by considering them one-by-one does the full shape of the <i>Constitution's</i> separation-of-powers principles emerge. It is nonsensical to interpret those provisions themselves in light of some general \"separation-of-powers principles\" dreamed up by the Court. Rather, they must be interpreted to mean what they were understood to mean when the people ratified them. And if the understood scope of the writ of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2298</span> habeas corpus was \"designed to restrain\" (as the Court says) the actions of the Executive, the understood <i>limits</i> upon that scope were (as the Court seems not to grasp) just as much \"designed to restrain\" the incursions of the Third Branch. \"Manipulation\" of the territorial reach of the writ by the Judiciary poses just as much a threat to the proper separation of powers as \"manipulation\" by the Executive. As I will show below, manipulation is what is afoot here. The understood limits upon the writ deny our jurisdiction over the habeas petitions brought by these enemy aliens, and entrust the President with the crucial wartime determinations about their status and continued confinement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court purports to derive from our precedents a \"functional\" test for the extraterritorial reach of the writ, <i>ante,</i> at 2258, which shows that the Military Commissions Act unconstitutionally restricts the scope of habeas. That is remarkable because the most pertinent of those precedents, <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager,</i> 339 U.S. 763, 70 S.Ct. 936, 94 L.Ed. 1255, conclusively establishes the opposite. There we were confronted with the claims of 21 Germans held at Landsberg Prison, an American military facility located in the American Zone of occupation in postwar Germany. They had been captured in China, and an American military commission sitting there had convicted them of war crimes \u0097 collaborating with the Japanese after Germany's surrender. <i>Id.,</i> at 765-766, 70 S.Ct. 936. Like the petitioners here, the Germans claimed that their detentions violated the Constitution and international law, and sought a writ of habeas corpus. Writing for the Court, Justice Jackson held that American courts lacked habeas jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We are cited to <i>[sic]</i> no instance where a court, in this or any other country where the writ is known, has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction. Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 768, 70 S.Ct. 936.</blockquote>\n<p>Justice Jackson then elaborated on the historical scope of the writ:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The alien, to whom the United States has been traditionally hospitable, has been accorded a generous and ascending scale of rights as he increases his identity with our society ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"But, in extending constitutional protections beyond the citizenry, the Court has been at pains to point out that it was the alien's presence within its territorial jurisdiction that gave the Judiciary power to act.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 770-771, 70 S.Ct. 936.</blockquote>\n<p>Lest there be any doubt about the primacy of territorial sovereignty in determining the jurisdiction of a habeas court over an alien, Justice Jackson distinguished two cases in which aliens had been permitted to seek habeas relief, on the ground that the prisoners in those cases were in custody within the sovereign territory of the United States. <i>Id.,</i> at 779-780, 70 S.Ct. 936 (discussing <i>Ex parte Quirin,</i> 317 U.S. 1, 63 S.Ct. 1, 87 L.Ed. 3 (1942), and <i>In re Yamashita,</i> 327 U.S. 1, 66 S.Ct. 340, 90 L.Ed. 499 (1946)). \"By reason of our sovereignty at that time over [the Philippines],\" Jackson wrote, \"Yamashita stood much as did Quirin before American courts.\" 339 U.S., at 780, 70 S.Ct. 936.</p>\n<p><i>Eisentrager</i> thus held \u0097 <i>held</i> beyond any doubt \u0097 that the Constitution does not ensure habeas for aliens held by the United <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2299</span> States in areas over which our Government is not sovereign.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court would have us believe that <i>Eisentrager</i> rested on \"[p]ractical considerations,\" such as the \"difficulties of ordering the Government to produce the prisoners in a habeas corpus proceeding.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2257. Formal sovereignty, says the Court, is merely one consideration \"that bears upon which constitutional guarantees apply\" in a given location. <i>Ante,</i> at 2258. This is a sheer rewriting of the case. <i>Eisentrager</i> mentioned practical concerns, to be sure \u0097 but not for the purpose of determining <i>under what circumstances</i> American courts could issue writs of habeas corpus for aliens abroad. It cited them to support <i>its holding</i> that the Constitution does not empower courts to issue writs of habeas corpus to aliens abroad <i>in any circumstances.</i> As Justice Black accurately said in dissent, \"the Court's opinion inescapably denies courts power to afford the least bit of protection for any alien who is subject to our occupation government abroad, even if he is neither enemy nor belligerent and even after peace is officially declared.\" 339 U.S., at 796, 70 S.Ct. 936.</p>\n<p>The Court also tries to change <i>Eisentrager</i> into a \"functional\" test by quoting a paragraph that lists the characteristics of the German petitioners:</p>\n<blockquote>\"To support [the] assumption [of a constitutional right to habeas corpus] we must hold that a prisoner of our military authorities is constitutionally entitled to the writ, even though he (a) is an enemy alien; (b) has never been or resided in the United States; (c) was captured outside of our territory and there held in military custody as a prisoner of war; (d) was tried and convicted by a Military Commission sitting outside the United States; (e) for offenses against laws of war committed outside the United States; (f) and is at all times imprisoned outside the United States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 777, 70 S.Ct. 936 (quoted in part, <i>ante,</i> at 2259).</blockquote>\n<p>But that paragraph is introduced by a sentence stating that \"[t]he foregoing demonstrates <i>how much further we must go</i> if we are to invest these enemy aliens, resident, captured and imprisoned abroad, with standing to demand access to our courts.\" 339 U.S., at 777, 70 S.Ct. 936 (emphasis added). How much further than <i>what</i>? Further than the rule set <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2300</span> forth in the prior section of the opinion, which said that \"in extending constitutional protections beyond the citizenry, the Court has been at pains to point out that it was the alien's presence within its territorial jurisdiction that gave the Judiciary power to act.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 771, 70 S.Ct. 936. In other words, the characteristics of the German prisoners were set forth, not in application of some \"functional\" test, but to show that the case before the Court represented an <i>a fortiori</i> application of the ordinary rule. That is reaffirmed by the sentences that immediately follow the listing of the Germans' characteristics:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We have pointed out that the privilege of litigation has been extended to aliens, whether friendly or enemy, only because permitting their presence in the country implied protection. No such basis can be invoked here, for these prisoners at no relevant time were within any territory over which the United States is sovereign, and the scenes of their offense, their capture, their trial and their punishment were all beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 777-778, 70 S.Ct. 936.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Eisentrager</i> nowhere mentions a \"functional\" test, and the notion that it is based upon such a principle is patently false.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court also reasons that <i>Eisentrager</i> must be read as a \"functional\" opinion because of our prior decisions in the Insular Cases. See <i>ante,</i> at 2253-2255. It cites our statement in <i>Balzac v. Porto Rico,</i> 258 U.S. 298, 312, 42 S.Ct. 343, 66 L.Ed. 627 (1922), that \"`the real issue in the <i>Insular Cases</i> was not whether the Constitution extended to the Philippines or Porto Rico when we went there, but which of its provisions were applicable by way of limitation upon the exercise of executive and legislative power in dealing with new conditions and requirements.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2254-2255. But the Court conveniently omits <i>Balzac</i>'s predicate to that statement: \"The Constitution of the United States is in force in Porto Rico as it is wherever and whenever the <i>sovereign power</i> of that government is exerted.\" 258 U.S., at 312, 42 S.Ct. 343 (emphasis added). The Insular Cases all concerned territories acquired by Congress under its Article IV authority and indisputably part of the sovereign territory of the United States. See <i>United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez,</i> 494 U.S. 259, 268, 110 S.Ct. 1056, 108 L.Ed.2d 222 (1990); <i>Reid v. Covert,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2301</span> 354 U.S. 1, 13, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957) (plurality opinion of Black, J.). None of the Insular Cases stands for the proposition that aliens located outside U.S. sovereign territory have constitutional rights, and <i>Eisentrager</i> held just the opposite with respect to habeas corpus. As I have said, <i>Eisentrager</i> distinguished <i>Yamashita</i> on the ground of \"our sovereignty [over the Philippines],\" 339 U.S., at 780, 70 S.Ct. 936.</p>\n<p>The Court also relies on the \"[p]ractical considerations\" that influenced our decision in <i>Reid v. Covert, supra</i><i>.</i> See <i>ante,</i> at 2255-2257. But all the Justices in the majority except Justice Frankfurter limited their analysis to the rights of <i>citizens</i> abroad. See <i>Reid, supra,</i> at 5-6, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (plurality opinion of Black, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 74-75, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Harlan, J., concurring in result). (Frankfurter limited his analysis to the even narrower class of civilian dependents of American military personnel abroad, see <i>id.,</i> at 45, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (opinion concurring in result).) In trying to wring some kind of support out of <i>Reid</i> for today's novel holding, the Court resorts to a chain of logic that does not hold. The members of the <i>Reid</i> majority, the Court says, were divided over whether <i>In re Ross,</i> 140 U.S. 453, 11 S.Ct. 897, 35 L.Ed. 581 (1891), which had (according to the Court) held that under certain circumstances American citizens abroad do not have indictment and jury-trial rights, should be overruled. In the Court's view, the <i>Reid</i> plurality would have overruled <i>Ross,</i> but Justices Frankfurter and Harlan preferred to distinguish it. The upshot: \"If citizenship had been the only relevant factor in the case, it would have been necessary for the Court to overturn <i>Ross,</i> something Justices Harlan and Frankfurter were unwilling to do.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2257. What, exactly, is this point supposed to prove? To say that \"practical considerations\" determine the precise content of the constitutional protections American citizens enjoy when they are abroad is quite different from saying that \"practical considerations\" determine whether aliens abroad enjoy any constitutional protections whatever, including habeas. In other words, merely because citizenship is not a <i>sufficient</i> factor to extend constitutional rights abroad does not mean that it is not a <i>necessary</i> one.</p>\n<p>The Court tries to reconcile <i>Eisentrager</i> with its holding today by pointing out that in postwar Germany, the United States was \"answerable to its Allies\" and did not \"pla[n] a long-term occupation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2260, 2260. Those factors were not mentioned in <i>Eisentrager.</i> Worse still, it is impossible to see how they relate to the Court's asserted purpose in creating this \"functional\" test \u0097 namely, to ensure a judicial inquiry into detention and prevent the political branches from acting with impunity. Can it possibly be that the Court trusts the political branches more when they are beholden to foreign powers than when they act alone?</p>\n<p>After transforming the <i>a fortiori</i> elements discussed above into a \"functional\" test, the Court is still left with the difficulty that most of those elements exist here as well with regard to all the detainees. To make the application of the newly crafted \"functional\" test produce a different result in the present cases, the Court must rely upon factors (d) and (e): The Germans had been tried by a military commission for violations of the laws of war; the present petitioners, by contrast, have been tried by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) whose procedural protections, according to the Court's <i>ipse dixit,</i> \"fall well short of the procedures and adversarial mechanisms that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2260. But no one looking for \"functional\" equivalents would put <i>Eisentrager</i> and the present cases in the same category, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2302</span> much less place the present cases in a preferred category. The difference between them cries out for lesser procedures in the present cases. The prisoners in <i>Eisentrager</i> were <i>prosecuted</i> for crimes after the cessation of hostilities; the prisoners here are enemy combatants <i>detained</i> during an ongoing conflict. See <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,</i> 542 U.S. 507, 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004) (plurality opinion) (suggesting, as an adequate substitute for habeas corpus, the use of a tribunal akin to a CSRT to authorize the detention of <i>American citizens</i> as enemy combatants during the course of the present conflict).</p>\n<p>The category of prisoner comparable to these detainees are not the <i>Eisentrager</i> criminal defendants, but the more than 400,000 prisoners of war detained in the United States alone during World War II. Not a single one was accorded the right to have his detention validated by a habeas corpus action in federal court \u0097 and that despite the fact that they were present on U.S. soil. See Bradley, The Military Commissions Act, Habeas Corpus, and the Geneva Conventions, 101 Am. J. Int'l L. 322, 338 (2007). The Court's analysis produces a crazy result: Whereas those convicted and sentenced to death for war crimes are without judicial remedy, all enemy combatants detained during a war, at least insofar as they are confined in an area away from the battlefield over which the United States exercises \"absolute and indefinite\" control, may seek a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. And, as an even more bizarre implication from the Court's reasoning, those prisoners whom the military plans to try by full-dress Commission at a future date may file habeas petitions and secure release before their trials take place.</p>\n<p>There is simply no support for the Court's assertion that constitutional rights extend to aliens held outside U.S. sovereign territory, see <i>Verdugo-Urquidez,</i> 494 U.S., at 271, 110 S.Ct. 1056, and <i>Eisentrager</i> could not be clearer that the privilege of habeas corpus does not extend to aliens abroad. By blatantly distorting <i>Eisentrager,</i> the Court avoids the difficulty of explaining why it should be overruled. See <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 854-855, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992) (identifying <i>stare decisis</i> factors). The rule that aliens abroad are not constitutionally entitled to habeas corpus has not proved unworkable in practice; if anything, it is the Court's \"functional\" test that does not (and never will) provide clear guidance for the future. <i>Eisentrager</i> forms a coherent whole with the accepted proposition that aliens abroad have no substantive rights under our Constitution. Since it was announced, no relevant factual premises have changed. It has engendered considerable reliance on the part of our military. And, as the Court acknowledges, text and history do not clearly compel a contrary ruling. It is a sad day for the rule of law when such an important constitutional precedent is discarded without an <i>apologia,</i> much less an apology.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>What drives today's decision is neither the meaning of the Suspension Clause, nor the principles of our precedents, but rather an inflated notion of judicial supremacy. The Court says that if the extraterritorial applicability of the Suspension Clause turned on formal notions of sovereignty, \"it would be possible for the political branches to govern without legal constraint\" in areas beyond the sovereign territory of the United States. <i>Ante,</i> at 2258-2259. That cannot be, the Court says, because it is the duty of this Court to say what the law is. <i>Id.,</i> at 2258-2259. It would be difficult to imagine a more <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2303</span> question-begging analysis. \"The very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies <i>properly before them.</i>\" <i>United States v. Raines,</i> 362 U.S. 17, 20-21, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960) (citing <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803); emphasis added). Our power \"to say what the law is\" is circumscribed by the limits of our statutorily and constitutionally conferred jurisdiction. See <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 573-578, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). And that is precisely the question in these cases: whether the Constitution confers habeas jurisdiction on federal courts to decide petitioners' claims. It is both irrational and arrogant to say that the answer must be yes, because otherwise we would not be supreme.</p>\n<p>But so long as there are <i>some</i> places to which habeas does not run \u0097 so long as the Court's new \"functional\" test will not be satisfied <i>in every case</i> \u0097 then there will be circumstances in which \"it would be possible for the political branches to govern without legal constraint.\" Or, to put it more impartially, areas in which the legal determinations of the <i>other</i> branches will be (shudder!) <i>supreme.</i> In other words, judicial supremacy is not really assured by the constitutional rule that the Court creates. The gap between rationale and rule leads me to conclude that the Court's ultimate, unexpressed goal is to preserve the power to review the confinement of enemy prisoners held by the Executive anywhere in the world. The \"functional\" test usefully evades the precedential landmine of <i>Eisentrager</i> but is so inherently subjective that it clears a wide path for the Court to traverse in the years to come.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Putting aside the conclusive precedent of <i>Eisentrager,</i> it is clear that the original understanding of the Suspension Clause was that habeas corpus was not available to aliens abroad, as Judge Randolph's thorough opinion for the court below detailed. See 476 F.3d 981, 988-990 (C.A.D.C.2007).</p>\n<p>The Suspension Clause reads: \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. The proper course of constitutional interpretation is to give the text the meaning it was understood to have at the time of its adoption by the people. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). That course is especially demanded when (as here) the Constitution limits the power of Congress to infringe upon a pre-existing common-law right. The nature of the writ of habeas corpus that cannot be suspended must be defined by the common-law writ that was available at the time of the founding. See <i>McNally v. Hill,</i> 293 U.S. 131, 135-136, 55 S.Ct. 24, 79 L.Ed. 238 (1934); see also <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 342, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); <i>D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC,</i> 315 U.S. 447, 471, n. 9, 62 S.Ct. 676, 86 L.Ed. 956 (1942) (Jackson, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>It is entirely clear that, at English common law, the writ of habeas corpus did not extend beyond the sovereign territory of the Crown. To be sure, the writ had an \"extraordinary territorial ambit,\" because it was a so-called \"prerogative writ,\" which, unlike other writs, could extend beyond the realm of England to other places where the Crown was sovereign. R. Sharpe, The Law of Habeas Corpus 188 (2d ed.1989) (hereinafter Sharpe); see also Note on the Power of the English Courts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2304</span> to Issue the Writ of Habeas to Places Within the Dominions of the Crown, But Out of England, and On the Position of Scotland in Relation to that Power, 8 Jurid. Rev. 157 (1896) (hereinafter Note on Habeas); <i>King v. Cowle,</i> 2 Burr. 834, 855-856, 97 Eng. Rep. 587, 599 (K.B.1759).</p>\n<p>But prerogative writs could not issue to foreign countries, even for British subjects; they were confined to the King's dominions \u0097 those areas over which the Crown was sovereign. See Sharpe 188; 2 R. Chambers, A Course of Lectures on the English Law 1767-1773, pp. 7-8 (Curley ed.1986); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 131 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone). Thus, the writ has never extended to Scotland, which, although united to England when James I succeeded to the English throne in 1603, was considered a foreign dominion under a different Crown \u0097 that of the King of Scotland. Sharpe 191; Note on Habeas 158.<sup>[5]</sup> That is why Lord Mansfield wrote that \"[t]o foreign dominions, which belong to a prince who succeeds to the throne of England, this Court has no power to send any writ of any kind. We cannot send a habeas corpus to Scotland....\" <i>Cowle, supra,</i> at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 599-600.</p>\n<p>The common-law writ was codified by the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, which \"stood alongside Magna Charta and the English Bill of Rights of 1689 as a towering common law lighthouse of liberty \u0097 a beacon by which framing lawyers in America consciously steered their course.\" Amar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84 Geo. L.J. 641, 663 (1996). The writ was established in the Colonies beginning in the 1690's and at least one colony adopted the 1679 Act almost verbatim. See Dept. of Political Science, Okla. State Univ., Research Reports, No. 1, R. Walker, The American Reception of the Writ of Liberty 12-16 (1961). Section XI of the Act stated where the writ could run. It \"may be directed and run into any county palatine, the cinque-ports, or other privileged places within the kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed, and the islands of Jersey or Guernsey.\" 31 Car. 2, ch. 2. The cinque-ports and county palatine were so-called \"exempt jurisdictions\" \u0097 franchises granted by the Crown in which local authorities would manage municipal affairs, including the court system, but over which the Crown maintained ultimate sovereignty. See 3 Blackstone 78-79. The other places listed \u0097 Wales, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Jersey, and Guernsey \u0097 were territories of the Crown even though not part England proper. See <i>Cowle, supra,</i> at 853-854, 97 Eng. Rep., at 598 (Wales and Berwick-upon-Tweed); 1 Blackstone 104 (Jersey and Guernsey); Sharpe 192 (same).</p>\n<p>The Act did not extend the writ elsewhere, even though the existence of other places to which British prisoners could be sent was recognized by the Act. The possibility of evading judicial review through such spiriting-away was eliminated, not by expanding the writ abroad, but by forbidding (in Article XII of the Act) the shipment of prisoners to places where the writ did not run or where its execution would be difficult. See 31 Car. 2, ch. 2; see generally Nutting, The Most Wholesome Law \u0097 The Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 65 Am. Hist. Rev. 527 (1960).</p>\n<p>The Habeas Corpus Act, then, confirms the consensus view of scholars and jurists that the writ did not run outside the sovereign territory of the Crown. The Court says that the idea that \"jurisdiction followed the King's officers\" is an equally <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2305</span> credible view. <i>Ante,</i> at 2248. It is not credible at all. The only support the Court cites for it is a page in Boumediene's brief, which in turn cites this Court's dicta in <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 482, 124 S.Ct. 2686, mischaracterizing Lord Mansfield's statement that the writ ran to any place that was \"under the subjection of the Crown,\" <i>Cowle, supra,</i> at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 599. It is clear that Lord Mansfield was saying that the writ extended outside the realm of England proper, not outside the sovereign territory of the Crown.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court dismisses the example of Scotland on the grounds that Scotland had its own judicial system and that the writ could not, as a practical matter, have been enforced there. <i>Ante,</i> at 2250. Those explanations are totally unpersuasive. The existence of a separate court system was never a basis for denying the power of a court to issue the writ. See 9 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 124 (3d ed.1944) (citing <i>Ex parte Anderson,</i> 3 El. and El. 487 (1861)). And as for logistical problems, the same difficulties were present for places like the Channel Islands, where the writ did run. The Court attempts to draw an analogy between the prudential limitations on issuing the writ to such remote areas within the sovereign territory of the Crown and the jurisdictional prohibition on issuing the writ to Scotland. See <i>ante,</i> at 2249-2250. But the very authority that the Court cites, Lord Mansfield, expressly distinguished between these two concepts, stating that English courts had the \"power\" to send the writ to places within the Crown's sovereignty, the \"only question\" being the \"propriety,\" while they had \"no power to send any writ of any kind\" to Scotland and other \"foreign dominions.\" <i>Cowle, supra,</i> at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 599-600. The writ did not run to Scotland because, even after the Union, \"Scotland remained a foreign dominion of the prince who succeeded to the English throne,\" and \"union did not extend the prerogative of the English crown to Scotland.\" Sharpe 191; see also Sir Matthew Hale's The Prerogatives of the King 19 (D. Yale ed.1976).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, <i>all</i> available historical evidence points to the conclusion that the writ would not have been available at common law for aliens captured and held outside the sovereign territory of the Crown. Despite three opening briefs, three reply briefs, and support from a legion of <i>amici,</i> petitioners have failed to identify a single case in the history of Anglo-American law that supports their claim to jurisdiction. The Court finds it significant that there is no recorded case <i>denying</i> jurisdiction to such prisoners either. See <i>ante,</i> at 2250-2251. But a case standing for the remarkable proposition that the writ could issue to a foreign land would surely have been reported, whereas a case denying such a writ for lack of jurisdiction would likely not. At a minimum, the absence of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2306</span> reported case either way leaves unrefuted the voluminous commentary stating that habeas was confined to the dominions of the Crown.</p>\n<p>What history teaches is confirmed by the nature of the limitations that the Constitution places upon suspension of the common-law writ. It can be suspended only \"in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion.\" Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. The latter case (invasion) is plainly limited to the territory of the United States; and while it is conceivable that a rebellion could be mounted by American citizens abroad, surely the overwhelming majority of its occurrences would be domestic. If the extraterritorial scope of habeas turned on flexible, \"functional\" considerations, as the Court holds, why would the Constitution limit its suspension almost entirely to instances of domestic crisis? Surely there is an even greater justification for suspension in foreign lands where the United States might hold prisoners of war during an ongoing conflict. And correspondingly, there is less threat to liberty when the Government suspends the writ's (supposed) application in foreign lands, where even on the most extreme view prisoners are entitled to fewer constitutional rights. It makes no sense, therefore, for the Constitution generally to forbid suspension of the writ abroad if indeed the writ has application there.</p>\n<p>It may be objected that the foregoing analysis proves too much, since this Court has already suggested that the writ of habeas corpus <i>does</i> run abroad for the benefit of United States citizens. \"[T]he position that United States citizens throughout the world may be entitled to habeas corpus rights ... is precisely the position that this Court adopted in <i>Eisentrager,</i> see 339 U.S., at 769-770, 70 S.Ct. 936, even while holding that aliens abroad did not have habeas corpus rights.\" <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 501, 502, 124 S.Ct. 2686 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted). The reason for that divergence is not difficult to discern. The common-law writ, as received into the law of the new constitutional Republic, took on such changes as were demanded by a system in which rule is derived from the consent of the governed, and in which citizens (not \"subjects\") are afforded defined protections against the Government. As Justice Story wrote for the Court,</p>\n<blockquote>\"The common law of England is not to be taken in all respects to be that of America. Our ancestors brought with them its general principles, and claimed it as their birthright; but they brought with them and adopted only that portion which was applicable to their situation.\" <i>Van Ness v. Pacard,</i> 2 Pet. 137, 144, 7 L.Ed. 374 (1829).</blockquote>\n<p>See also Hall, The Common Law: An Account of its Reception in the United States, 4 Vand. L.Rev. 791 (1951). It accords with that principle to say, as the plurality opinion said in <i>Reid:</i> \"When the Government reaches out to punish a citizen who is abroad, the shield which the Bill of Rights and other parts of the Constitution provide to protect his life and liberty should not be stripped away just because he happens to be in another land.\" 354 U.S., at 6, 77 S.Ct. 1222; see also <i>Verdugo-Urquidez,</i> 494 U.S., at 269-270, 110 S.Ct. 1056. On that analysis, \"[t]he distinction between citizens and aliens follows from the undoubted proposition that the Constitution does not create, nor do general principles of law create, any juridical relation between our country and some undefined, limitless class of noncitizens who are beyond our territory.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 275, 110 S.Ct. 1056 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>In sum, because I conclude that the text and history of the Suspension Clause provide no basis for our jurisdiction, I would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2307</span> affirm the Court of Appeals even if <i>Eisentrager</i> did not govern these cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Today the Court warps our Constitution in a way that goes beyond the narrow issue of the reach of the Suspension Clause, invoking judicially brainstormed separation-of-powers principles to establish a manipulable \"functional\" test for the extraterritorial reach of habeas corpus (and, no doubt, for the extraterritorial reach of other constitutional protections as well). It blatantly misdescribes important precedents, most conspicuously Justice Jackson's opinion for the Court in <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager</i><i>.</i> It breaks a chain of precedent as old as the common law that prohibits judicial inquiry into detentions of aliens abroad absent statutory authorization. And, most tragically, it sets our military commanders the impossible task of proving to a civilian court, under whatever standards this Court devises in the future, that evidence supports the confinement of each and every enemy prisoner.</p>\n<p>The Nation will live to regret what the Court has done today. I dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In light of the foregoing, the concurrence is wrong to suggest that I \"insufficiently appreciat[e]\" the issue of delay in these cases. See <i>ante,</i> at 2278 (opinion of SOUTER, J.). This Court issued its decisions in <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> 542 U.S. 466, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548, and <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</i> 542 U.S. 507, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578, in 2004. The concurrence makes it sound as if the political branches have done nothing in the interim. In fact, Congress responded 18 months later by enacting the DTA. Congress cannot be faulted for taking that time to consider how best to accommodate both the detainees' interests and the need to keep the American people safe. Since the DTA became law, petitioners have steadfastly refused to avail themselves of the statute's review mechanisms. It is unfair to complain that the DTA system involves too much delay when petitioners have consistently refused to use it, preferring to litigate instead. Today's decision obligating district courts to craft new procedures to replace those in the DTA will only prolong the process\u0097and delay relief.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court wonders what might happen if the detainee puts forward new material evidence but the Deputy Secretary refuses to convene a new CSRT. See <i>ante,</i> at 2273-2274. The answer is that the detainee can petition the D.C. Circuit for review. The DTA directs that the procedures for review of new evidence be included among \"[t]he procedures submitted under paragraph (1)(A)\" governing CSRT review of enemy combatant status \u00a7 1405(a)(3), 119 Stat. 3476. It is undisputed that the D.C. Circuit has statutory authority to review and enforce these procedures. See DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C)(i), <i>id.,</i> at 2742.</p>\n<p>[1]  Even today, the Court cannot resist striking a pose of faux deference to Congress and the President. Citing the above quoted passage, the Court says: \"The political branches, consistent with their independent obligations to interpret and uphold the Constitution, can engage in a genuine debate about how best to preserve constitutional values while protecting the Nation from terrorism.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2277. Indeed. What the Court apparently means is that the political branches can debate, after which the Third Branch will decide.</p>\n<p>[2]  The opinion seeks to avoid this straightforward conclusion by saying that the Court has been \"careful not to foreclose the possibility that the protections of the Suspension Clause have expanded along with post-1789 developments that define the present scope of the writ.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2247-2248 (citing <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289 300-301, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001)). But not foreclosing the possibility that they have expanded is not the same as demonstrating (or at least holding without demonstration, which seems to suffice for today's majority) that they have expanded. The Court must either hold that the Suspension Clause has \"expanded\" in its application to aliens abroad, or acknowledge that it has no basis to set aside the actions of Congress and the President. It does neither.</p>\n<p>[3]  In its failed attempt to distinguish <i>Eisentrager,</i> the Court comes up with the notion that \"<i>de jure</i> sovereignty\" is simply an additional factor that can be added to (presumably) \"<i>de facto</i> sovereignty\" (<i>i.e.,</i> practical control) to determine the availability of habeas for aliens, but that it is not a necessary factor, whereas <i>de facto</i> sovereignty is. It is perhaps in this <i>de facto</i> sense, the Court speculates, that <i>Eisentrager</i> found \"sovereignty\" lacking. See <i>ante,</i> at 2252-2253. If that were so, one would have expected <i>Eisentrager</i> to explain in some detail why the United States did not have practical control over the American zone of occupation. It did not (and probably could not). Of course this novel <i>de facto-de jure</i> approach does not explain why the writ never issued to Scotland, which was assuredly within the <i>de facto</i> control of the English crown. See <i>infra,</i> at 2305.\n</p>\n<p>To support its holding that <i>de facto</i> sovereignty is relevant to the reach of habeas corpus, the Court cites our decision in <i>Fleming v. Page,</i> 9 How. 603, 13 L.Ed. 276 (1850), a case about the application of a customs statute to a foreign port occupied by U.S. forces. See <i>ante,</i> at 2252. The case used the phrase \"subject to the sovereignty and dominion of the United States\" to refer to the United States' practical control over a \"foreign country.\" 9 How., at 614. But <i>Fleming</i> went on to explain that because the port remained part of the \"enemy's country,\" even though under U.S. military occupation, \"its subjugation did not compel the United States, while they held it, to regard it as part of their dominions, nor to give to it any form of civil government, nor to extend to it our laws.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 618. If <i>Fleming</i> is relevant to these cases at all, it undermines the Court's holding.</p>\n<p>[4]  Justice SOUTER's concurrence relies on our decision four Terms ago in <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> 542 U.S. 466, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004), where the Court interpreted the habeas statute to extend to aliens held at Guantanamo Bay. He thinks that \"no one who reads the Court's opinion in <i>Rasul</i> could seriously doubt that the jurisdictional question must be answered the same way in purely constitutional cases.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2240-2241. But <i>Rasul</i> was devoted primarily to an explanation of why <i>Eisentrager</i>'s statutory holding no longer controlled given our subsequent decision in <i>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,</i> 410 U.S. 484, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973). See <i>Rasul, supra,</i> at 475-479, 124 S.Ct. 2686. And the opinion of the Court today \u0097 which Justice SOUTER joins \u0097 expressly rejects the historical evidence cited in <i>Rasul</i> to support its conclusion about the reach of habeas corpus. Compare <i>id.,</i> at 481-482, 124 S.Ct. 2686, with <i>ante,</i> at 2249. Moreover, even if one were to accept as true what Justice SOUTER calls <i>Rasul</i>'s \"well-considered\" dictum, that does not explain why <i>Eisentrager</i>'s constitutional holding must be overruled or how it can be distinguished. (After all, <i>Rasul</i> distinguished <i>Eisentrager</i>'s statutory holding on a ground inapplicable to its constitutional holding.) In other words, even if the Court were to conclude that <i>Eisentrager</i>'s rule was incorrect as an original matter, the Court would have to explain the justification for departing from that precedent. It therefore cannot possibly be true that <i>Rasul</i> controls this case, as Justice SOUTER suggests.</p>\n<p>[5]  My dissent in <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> 542 U.S. 466, 503, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004), mistakenly included Scotland among the places to which the writ could run.</p>\n<p>[6]  The dicta in <i>Rasul</i> also cited <i>Ex parte Mwenya,</i> [1960] 1 Q.B. 241, (C. A.), but as I explained in dissent, \"[e]ach judge [in <i>Mwenya</i>] made clear that the detainee's status as a subject was material to the resolution of the case,\" 542 U.S., at 504, 124 S.Ct. 2686.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Court also argues that the fact that the writ could run to Ireland, even though it was ruled under a \"separate\" crown, shows that formal sovereignty was not the touchstone of habeas jurisdiction. <i>Ante,</i> at 2250-2251. The passage from Blackstone that the Court cites, however, describes Ireland as \"a dependent, subordinate kingdom\" that was part of the \"king's dominions.\" 1 Blackstone 98, 100 (internal quotation marks omitted). And Lord Mansfield's opinion in <i>Cowle</i> plainly understood Ireland to be \"a dominion of the Crown of England,\" in contrast to the \"foreign dominio[n]\" of Scotland, and thought that distinction dispositive of the question of habeas jurisdiction. <i>Cowle, supra,</i> at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 599-600.</p>\n\n</div>",

S. 507, 518, 588\u2013589, five Justices recognized that\n   detaining individuals captured while fighting against the United\n   States in Afghanistan for the duration of that conflict was a funda-\n   mental and accepted incident to war. Thereafter, the Defense De-\n   partment established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs)\n   to determine whether individuals detained at the U. S. Naval Station\n   at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were \u201cenemy combatants.\u201d\n      Petitioners are aliens detained at Guantanamo after being cap-\n   tured in Afghanistan or elsewhere abroad and designated enemy\n   combatants by CSRTs. Denying membership in the al Qaeda terror-\n   ist network that carried out the September 11 attacks and the Tali-\n   ban regime that supported al Qaeda, each petitioner sought a writ of\n   habeas corpus in the District Court, which ordered the cases dis-\n   missed for lack of jurisdiction because Guantanamo is outside sover-\n   eign U.

In the second, the judge held that the de-\n    tainees had due process rights.\n        While appeals were pending, Congress passed the Detainee Treat-\n    ment Act of 2005 (DTA), \u00a71005(e) of which amended 28 U. S. C. \u00a72241\n    to provide that \u201cno court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to\n    . . . consider . . . an application for . . . habeas corpus filed by or on\n    behalf of an alien detained . . . at Guantanamo,\u201d and gave the D. C.\n    Circuit \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction to review CSRT decisions. In Ham-\n    dan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 576\u2013577, the Court held this provi-\n    sion inapplicable to cases (like petitioners\u2019) pending when the DTA\n    was enacted. Congress responded with the Military Commissions Act\n    of 2006 (MCA), \u00a77(a) of which amended \u00a72241(e)(1) to deny jurisdic-\n    tion with respect to habeas actions by detained aliens determined to\n    be enemy combatants, while \u00a72241(e)(2) denies jurisdiction as to \u201cany\n    other action against the United States . . . relating to any aspect of\n    the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement\u201d\n    of a detained alien determined to be an enemy combatant. MCA\n    \u00a77(b) provides that the 2241(e) amendments \u201cshall take effect on the\n    date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply to all cases, without\n    exception, pending on or after [that] date . . . which relate to any as-\n    pect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of de-\n    tention of an alien detained . . . since September 11, 2001.\u201d\n        The D. C. Circuit concluded that MCA \u00a77 must be read to strip\n    from it, and all federal courts, jurisdiction to consider petitioners\u2019 ha-\n    beas applications; that petitioners are not entitled to habeas or the\n    protections of the Suspension Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 2,\n    which provides that \u201c[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus\n    shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion\n    the public Safety may require it\u201d; and that it was therefore unneces-\n    sary to consider whether the DTA provided an adequate and effective\n    substitute for habeas.\nHeld:\n    1. MCA \u00a77 denies the federal courts jurisdiction to hear habeas ac-\n tions, like the instant cases, that were pending at the time of its en-\n actment. Section \u00a77(b)\u2019s effective date provision undoubtedly applies\n to habeas actions, which, by definition, \u201crelate to . . . detention\u201d\n within that section\u2019s meaning. Petitioners argue to no avail that\n \u00a77(b) does not apply to a \u00a72241(e)(1) habeas action, but only to \u201cany\n other action\u201d under \u00a72241(e)(2), because it largely repeats that sec-\n tion\u2019s language. The phrase \u201cother action\u201d in \u00a72241(e)(2) cannot be\n understood without referring back to \u00a72241(e)(1), which explicitly\n mentions the \u201cwrit of habeas corpus.\u201d Because the two paragraphs\u2019\n structure implies that habeas is a type of action \u201crelating to any as-\n                    Cite as: 553 U.

This is confirmed\nby the MCA\u2019s legislative history. Thus, if MCA \u00a77 is valid, petition-\ners\u2019 cases must be dismissed. Pp. 5\u20138.\n   2. Petitioners have the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus.\nThey are not barred from seeking the writ or invoking the Suspen-\nsion Clause\u2019s protections because they have been designated as en-\nemy combatants or because of their presence at Guantanamo. Pp. 8\u2013\n41.\n      (a) A brief account of the writ\u2019s history and origins shows that\nprotection for the habeas privilege was one of the few safeguards of\nliberty specified in a Constitution that, at the outset, had no Bill of\nRights; in the system the Framers conceived, the writ has a central-\nity that must inform proper interpretation of the Suspension Clause.\nThat the Framers considered the writ a vital instrument for the pro-\ntection of individual liberty is evident from the care taken in the Sus-\npension Clause to specify the limited grounds for its suspension: The\nwrit may be suspended only when public safety requires it in times of\nrebellion or invasion. The Clause is designed to protect against cycli-\ncal abuses of the writ by the Executive and Legislative Branches. It\nprotects detainee rights by a means consistent with the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s essential design, ensuring that, except during periods of formal\nsuspension, the Judiciary will have a time-tested device, the writ, to\nmaintain the \u201cdelicate balance of governance.\u201d Hamdi, supra, at 536.\nSeparation-of-powers principles, and the history that influenced their\ndesign, inform the Clause\u2019s reach and purpose. Pp. 8\u201315.\n      (b) A diligent search of founding-era precedents and legal com-\nmentaries reveals no certain conclusions. None of the cases the par-\nties cite reveal whether a common-law court would have granted, or\nrefused to hear for lack of jurisdiction, a habeas petition by a prisoner\ndeemed an enemy combatant, under a standard like the Defense De-\npartment\u2019s in these cases, and when held in a territory, like Guan-\ntanamo, over which the Government has total military and civil con-\ntrol. The evidence as to the writ\u2019s geographic scope at common law is\ninformative, but, again, not dispositive. Petitioners argue that the\nsite of their detention is analogous to two territories outside England\nto which the common-law writ ran, the exempt jurisdictions and In-\ndia, but critical differences between these places and Guantanamo\nrender these claims unpersuasive. The Government argues that\nGuantanamo is more closely analogous to Scotland and Hanover,\nwhere the writ did not run, but it is unclear whether the common-law\ncourts lacked the power to issue the writ there, or whether they re-\nfrained from doing so for prudential reasons. The parties\u2019 arguments\nthat the very lack of a precedent on point supports their respective\n4                         BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    positions are premised upon the doubtful assumptions that the his-\n    torical record is complete and that the common law, if properly un-\n    derstood, yields a definite answer to the questions before the Court.\n    Pp. 15\u201322.\n         (c) The Suspension Clause has full effect at Guantanamo. The\n    Government\u2019s argument that the Clause affords petitioners no rights\n    because the United States does not claim sovereignty over the naval\n    station is rejected. Pp. 22\u201342.\n            (i) The Court does not question the Government\u2019s position that\n    Cuba maintains sovereignty, in the legal and technical sense, over\n    Guantanamo, but it does not accept the Government\u2019s premise that\n    de jure sovereignty is the touchstone of habeas jurisdiction. Com-\n    mon-law habeas\u2019 history provides scant support for this proposition,\n    and it is inconsistent with the Court\u2019s precedents and contrary to\n    fundamental separation-of-powers principles. Pp. 22\u201325.\n            (ii) Discussions of the Constitution\u2019s extraterritorial applica-\n    tion in cases involving provisions other than the Suspension Clause\n    undermine the Government\u2019s argument. Fundamental questions re-\n    garding the Constitution\u2019s geographic scope first arose when the Na-\n    tion acquired Hawaii and the noncontiguous Territories ceded by\n    Spain after the Spanish-American War, and Congress discontinued\n    its prior practice of extending constitutional rights to territories by\n    statute. In the so-called Insular Cases, the Court held that the Con-\n    stitution had independent force in the territories that was not contin-\n    gent upon acts of legislative grace. See, e.g., Dorr v. United States,\n    195 U. S. 138. Yet because of the difficulties and disruption inherent\n    in transforming the former Spanish colonies\u2019 civil-law system into an\n    Anglo-American system, the Court adopted the doctrine of territorial\n    incorporation, under which the Constitution applies in full in incor-\n    porated Territories surely destined for statehood but only in part in\n    unincorporated Territories. See, e.g., id., at 143. Practical considera-\n    tions likewise influenced the Court\u2019s analysis in Reid v. Covert, 354\n    U. S. 1, where, in applying the jury provisions of the Fifth and Sixth\n    Amendments to American civilians being tried by the U. S. military\n    abroad, both the plurality and the concurrences noted the relevance\n    of practical considerations, related not to the petitioners\u2019 citizenship,\n    but to the place of their confinement and trial. Finally, in holding\n    that habeas jurisdiction did not extend to enemy aliens, convicted of\n    violating the laws of war, who were detained in a German prison dur-\n    ing the Allied Powers\u2019 post-World War II occupation, the Court, in\n    Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, stressed the practical difficul-\n    ties of ordering the production of the prisoners, id., at 779. The Gov-\n    ernment\u2019s reading of Eisentrager as adopting a formalistic test for de-\n    termining the Suspension Clause\u2019s reach is rejected because: (1) the\n                   Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                     5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ndiscussion of practical considerations in that case was integral to a\npart of the Court\u2019s opinion that came before it announced its holding,\nsee id., at 781; (2) it mentioned the concept of territorial sovereignty\nonly twice in its opinion, in contrast to its significant discussion of\npractical barriers to the running of the writ; and (3) if the Govern-\nment\u2019s reading were correct, the opinion would have marked not only\na change in, but a complete repudiation of, the Insular Cases\u2019 (and\nlater Reid\u2019s) functional approach. A constricted reading of Eisen-\ntrager overlooks what the Court sees as a common thread uniting all\nthese cases: The idea that extraterritoriality questions turn on objec-\ntive factors and practical concerns, not formalism. Pp. 25\u201334.\n       (iii) The Government\u2019s sovereignty-based test raises troubling\nseparation-of-powers concerns, which are illustrated by Guan-\ntanamo\u2019s political history. Although the United States has main-\ntained complete and uninterrupted control of Guantanamo for over\n100 years, the Government\u2019s view is that the Constitution has no ef-\nfect there, at least as to noncitizens, because the United States dis-\nclaimed formal sovereignty in its 1903 lease with Cuba. The Nation\u2019s\nbasic charter cannot be contracted away like this. The Constitution\ngrants Congress and the President the power to acquire, dispose of,\nand govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its\nterms apply. To hold that the political branches may switch the Con-\nstitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not\nthis Court, say \u201cwhat the law is.\u201d Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch\n137, 177. These concerns have particular bearing upon the Suspen-\nsion Clause question here, for the habeas writ is itself an indispensa-\nble mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers. Pp. 34\u201336.\n       (iv) Based on Eisentrager, supra, at 777, and the Court\u2019s rea-\nsoning in its other extraterritoriality opinions, at least three factors\nare relevant in determining the Suspension Clause\u2019s reach: (1) the\ndetainees\u2019 citizenship and status and the adequacy of the process\nthrough which that status was determined; (2) the nature of the sites\nwhere apprehension and then detention took place; and (3) the prac-\ntical obstacles inherent in resolving the prisoner\u2019s entitlement to the\nwrit. Application of this framework reveals, first, that petitioners\u2019\nstatus is in dispute: They are not American citizens, but deny they\nare enemy combatants; and although they have been afforded some\nprocess in CSRT proceedings, there has been no Eisentrager\u2013style\ntrial by military commission for violations of the laws of war. Second,\nwhile the sites of petitioners\u2019 apprehension and detention weigh\nagainst finding they have Suspension Clause rights, there are critical\ndifferences between Eisentrager\u2019s German prison, circa 1950, and the\nGuantanamo Naval Station in 2008, given the Government\u2019s absolute\nand indefinite control over the naval station. Third, although the\n6                         BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    Court is sensitive to the financial and administrative costs of holding\n    the Suspension Clause applicable in a case of military detention\n    abroad, these factors are not dispositive because the Government\n    presents no credible arguments that the military mission at Guan-\n    tanamo would be compromised if habeas courts had jurisdiction. The\n    situation in Eisentrager was far different, given the historical context\n    and nature of the military\u2019s mission in post-War Germany. Pp. 36\u2013\n    41.\n          (d) Petitioners are therefore entitled to the habeas privilege, and\n    if that privilege is to be denied them, Congress must act in accor-\n    dance with the Suspension Clause\u2019s requirements. Cf. Rasul, 542\n    U. S., at 564. Pp. 41\u201342.\n       3. Because the DTA\u2019s procedures for reviewing detainees\u2019 status\n    are not an adequate and effective substitute for the habeas writ,\n    MCA \u00a77 operates as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. Pp.\n    42\u201364.\n          (a) Given its holding that the writ does not run to petitioners, the\n    D. C. Circuit found it unnecessary to consider whether there was an\n    adequate substitute for habeas. This Court usually remands for con-\n    sideration of questions not decided below, but departure from this\n    rule is appropriate in \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances, see, e.g., Cooper\n    Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 169, here, the\n    grave separation-of-powers issues raised by these cases and the fact\n    that petitioners have been denied meaningful access to a judicial fo-\n    rum for years. Pp. 42\u201344.\n          (b) Historically, Congress has taken care to avoid suspensions of\n    the writ. For example, the statutes at issue in the Court\u2019s two lead-\n    ing cases addressing habeas substitutes, Swain v. Pressley, 430 U. S.\n    372, and United States v. Hayman, 342 U. S. 205, were attempts to\n    streamline habeas relief, not to cut it back. Those cases provide little\n    guidance here because, inter alia, the statutes in question gave the\n    courts broad remedial powers to secure the historic office of the writ,\n    and included saving clauses to preserve habeas review as an avenue\n    of last resort. In contrast, Congress intended the DTA and the MCA\n    to circumscribe habeas review, as is evident from the unequivocal na-\n    ture of MCA \u00a77\u2019s jurisdiction-stripping language, from the DTA\u2019s text\n    limiting the Court of Appeals\u2019 jurisdiction to assessing whether the\n    CSRT complied with the \u201cstandards and procedures specified by the\n    Secretary of Defense,\u201d DTA \u00a71005(e)(2)(C), and from the absence of a\n    saving clause in either Act. That Congress intended to create a more\n    limited procedure is also confirmed by the legislative history and by a\n    comparison of the DTA and the habeas statute that would govern in\n    MCA \u00a77\u2019s absence, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72241. In \u00a72241, Congress authorized\n    \u201cany justice\u201d or \u201ccircuit judge\u201d to issue the writ, thereby accommodat-\n                   Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                     7\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ning the necessity for factfinding that will arise in some cases by al-\nlowing the appellate judge or Justice to transfer the case to a district\ncourt. See \u00a72241(b). However, by granting the D. C. Circuit \u201cexclu-\nsive\u201d jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 cases, see DTA \u00a71005(e)(2)(A),\nCongress has foreclosed that option in these cases. Pp. 44\u201349.\n     (c) This Court does not endeavor to offer a comprehensive sum-\nmary of the requisites for an adequate habeas substitute. It is un-\ncontroversial, however, that the habeas privilege entitles the prisoner\nto a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pur-\nsuant to \u201cthe erroneous application or interpretation\u201d of relevant law,\nINS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 302, and the habeas court must have\nthe power to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully\ndetained. But more may be required depending on the circum-\nstances. Petitioners identify what they see as myriad deficiencies in\nthe CSRTs, the most relevant being the constraints upon the de-\ntainee\u2019s ability to rebut the factual basis for the Government\u2019s asser-\ntion that he is an enemy combatant. At the CSRT stage the detainee\nhas limited means to find or present evidence to challenge the Gov-\nernment\u2019s case, does not have the assistance of counsel, and may not\nbe aware of the most critical allegations that the Government relied\nupon to order his detention. His opportunity to confront witnesses is\nlikely to be more theoretical than real, given that there are no limits\non the admission of hearsay. The Court therefore agrees with peti-\ntioners that there is considerable risk of error in the tribunal\u2019s find-\nings of fact. And given that the consequence of error may be deten-\ntion for the duration of hostilities that may last a generation or more,\nthe risk is too significant to ignore. Accordingly, for the habeas writ,\nor its substitute, to function as an effective and meaningful remedy in\nthis context, the court conducting the collateral proceeding must have\nsome ability to correct any errors, to assess the sufficiency of the\nGovernment\u2019s evidence, and to admit and consider relevant exculpa-\ntory evidence that was not introduced during the earlier proceeding.\nIn re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1, 5, 8, and Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1,\n23\u201325, distinguished. Pp. 49\u201357.\n     (d) Petitioners have met their burden of establishing that the\nDTA review process is, on its face, an inadequate substitute for ha-\nbeas. Among the constitutional infirmities from which the DTA po-\ntentially suffers are the absence of provisions allowing petitioners to\nchallenge the President\u2019s authority under the AUMF to detain them\nindefinitely, to contest the CSRT\u2019s findings of fact, to supplement the\nrecord on review with exculpatory evidence discovered after the\nCSRT proceedings, and to request release. The statute cannot be\nread to contain each of these constitutionally required procedures.\nMCA \u00a77 thus effects an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.\n8                        BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    There is no jurisdictional bar to the District Court\u2019s entertaining pe-\n    titioners\u2019 claims. Pp. 57\u201364.\n       4. Nor are there prudential barriers to habeas review. Pp. 64\u201370.\n          (a) Petitioners need not seek review of their CSRT determina-\n    tions in the D. C. Circuit before proceeding with their habeas actions\n    in the District Court. If these cases involved detainees held for only a\n    short time while awaiting their CSRT determinations, or were it\n    probable that the Court of Appeals could complete a prompt review of\n    their applications, the case for requiring temporary abstention or ex-\n    haustion of alternative remedies would be much stronger. But these\n    qualifications no longer pertain here. In some instances six years\n    have elapsed without the judicial oversight that habeas corpus or an\n    adequate substitute demands. To require these detainees to pursue\n    the limited structure of DTA review before proceeding with habeas\n    actions would be to require additional months, if not years, of delay.\n    This holding should not be read to imply that a habeas court should\n    intervene the moment an enemy combatant steps foot in a territory\n    where the writ runs. Except in cases of undue delay, such as the pre-\n    sent, federal courts should refrain from entertaining an enemy com-\n    batant\u2019s habeas petition at least until after the CSRT has had a\n    chance to review his status. Pp. 64\u201367.\n          (b) In effectuating today\u2019s holding, certain accommodations\u2014\n    including channeling future cases to a single district court and re-\n    quiring that court to use its discretion to accommodate to the greatest\n    extent possible the Government\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting\n    sources and intelligence gathering methods\u2014should be made to re-\n    duce the burden habeas proceedings will place on the military, with-\n    out impermissibly diluting the writ\u2019s protections. Pp. 67\u201368.\n       5. In considering both the procedural and substantive standards\n    used to impose detention to prevent acts of terrorism, the courts must\n    accord proper deference to the political branches. However, security\n    subsists, too, in fidelity to freedom\u2019s first principles, chief among\n    them being freedom from arbitrary and unlawful restraint and the\n    personal liberty that is secured by adherence to the separation of\n    powers.

There are others detained there, also\naliens, who are not parties to this suit.\n   Petitioners present a question not resolved by our ear\u00ad\nlier cases relating to the detention of aliens at Guan\u00ad\ntanamo: whether they have the constitutional privilege of\nhabeas corpus, a privilege not to be withdrawn except in\nconformance with the Suspension Clause, Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 2.\nWe hold these petitioners do have the habeas corpus\nprivilege. Congress has enacted a statute, the Detainee\nTreatment Act of 2005 (DTA), 119 Stat. 2739, that pro\u00ad\n2                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvides certain procedures for review of the detainees\u2019\nstatus. We hold that those procedures are not an ade\u00ad\nquate and effective substitute for habeas corpus. There\u00ad\nfore \u00a77 of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), 28\nU. S. C. A. \u00a72241(e) (Supp. 2007), operates as an unconsti\u00ad\ntutional suspension of the writ. We do not address\nwhether the President has authority to detain these peti\u00ad\ntioners nor do we hold that the writ must issue. These\nand other questions regarding the legality of the detention\nare to be resolved in the first instance by the District\nCourt.\n                              I\n  Under the Authorization for Use of Military Force\n(AUMF), \u00a72(a), 115 Stat. 224, note following 50 U.

Each petitioner\nappeared before a separate CSRT; was determined to be\nan enemy combatant; and has sought a writ of habeas\ncorpus in the United States District Court for the District\nof Columbia.\n   The first actions commenced in February 2002. The\nDistrict Court ordered the cases dismissed for lack of\njurisdiction because the naval station is outside the sover\u00ad\neign territory of the United States. See Rasul v. Bush, 215\nF. Supp. 2d 55 (2002). The Court of Appeals for the Dis\u00ad\ntrict of Columbia Circuit affirmed. See Al Odah v. United\nStates, 321 F. 3d 1134, 1145 (2003). We granted certiorari\nand reversed, holding that 28 U. S. C. \u00a72241 extended\nstatutory habeas corpus jurisdiction to Guantanamo. See\nRasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466, 473 (2004). The constitu\u00ad\ntional issue presented in the instant cases was not reached\nin Rasul. Id., at 476.\n   After Rasul, petitioners\u2019 cases were consolidated and\nentertained in two separate proceedings. In the first set of\ncases, Judge Richard J. Leon granted the Government\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss, holding that the detainees had no\n4                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrights that could be vindicated in a habeas corpus action.\nIn the second set of cases Judge Joyce Hens Green reached\nthe opposite conclusion, holding the detainees had rights\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\nSee Khalid v. Bush, 355 F. Supp. 2d 311, 314 (DC 2005);\nIn re Guantanamo Detainee Cases, 355 F. Supp. 2d 443,\n464 (DC 2005).\n  While appeals were pending from the District Court\ndecisions, Congress passed the DTA. Subsection (e) of\n\u00a71005 of the DTA amended 28 U. S. C. \u00a72241 to provide\nthat \u201cno court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to\nhear or consider . . . an application for a writ of habeas\ncorpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the\nDepartment of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\u201d 119\nStat. 2742. Section 1005 further provides that the Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit shall have\n\u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction to review decisions of the CSRTs.\nIbid.\n  In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 576\u2013577 (2006),\nthe Court held this provision did not apply to cases (like\npetitioners\u2019) pending when the DTA was enacted. Con\u00ad\ngress responded by passing the MCA, 10 U. S. C. A. \u00a7948a\net seq. (Supp. 2007), which again amended \u00a72241. The\ntext of the statutory amendment is discussed below. See\nPart II, infra. (Four Members of the Hamdan majority\nnoted that \u201c[n]othing prevent[ed] the President from\nreturning to Congress to seek the authority he believes\nnecessary.\u201d 548 U. S., at 636 (BREYER, J., concurring).\nThe authority to which the concurring opinion referred\nwas the authority to \u201ccreate military commissions of the\nkind at issue\u201d in the case. Ibid. Nothing in that opinion\ncan be construed as an invitation for Congress to suspend\nthe writ.)\n  Petitioners\u2019 cases were consolidated on appeal, and the\nparties filed supplemental briefs in light of our decision in\nHamdan. The Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling, 476 F. 3d 981\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(CADC 2007), is the subject of our present review and\ntoday\u2019s decision.\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that MCA \u00a77 must be\nread to strip from it, and all federal courts, jurisdiction to\nconsider petitioners\u2019 habeas corpus applications, id., at\n987; that petitioners are not entitled to the privilege of the\nwrit or the protections of the Suspension Clause, id., at\n990\u2013991; and, as a result, that it was unnecessary to\nconsider whether Congress provided an adequate and\neffective substitute for habeas corpus in the DTA.\n  We granted certiorari. 551 U. S. ___ (2007).\n                                II\n  As a threshold matter, we must decide whether MCA \u00a77\ndenies the federal courts jurisdiction to hear habeas cor\u00ad\npus actions pending at the time of its enactment. We hold\nthe statute does deny that jurisdiction, so that, if the\nstatute is valid, petitioners\u2019 cases must be dismissed.\n  As amended by the terms of the MCA, 28 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a72241(e) (Supp. 2007) now provides:\n       \u201c(1) No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdic\u00ad\n    tion to hear or consider an application for a writ of\n    habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien de\u00ad\n    tained by the United States who has been deter\u00ad\n    mined by the United States to have been properly de\u00ad\n    tained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such\n    determination.\n       \u201c(2) Except as provided in [\u00a7\u00a71005(e)(2) and (e)(3)\n    of the DTA] no court, justice, or judge shall have ju\u00ad\n    risdiction to hear or consider any other action\n    against the United States or its agents relating to\n    any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment,\n    trial, or conditions of confinement of an alien who is\n    or was detained by the United States and has been\n    determined by the United States to have been prop\u00ad\n    erly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting\n6                   BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    such determination.\u201d\n  Section 7(b) of the MCA provides the effective date for\nthe amendment of \u00a72241(e). It states:\n    \u201cThe amendment made by [MCA \u00a77(a)] shall take ef\u00ad\n    fect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall\n    apply to all cases, without exception, pending on or af\u00ad\n    ter the date of the enactment of this Act which relate\n    to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment,\n    trial, or conditions of detention of an alien detained by\n    the United States since September 11, 2001.\u201d 120\n    Stat. 2636.\n   There is little doubt that the effective date provision\napplies to habeas corpus actions. Those actions, by defini\u00ad\ntion, are cases \u201cwhich relate to . . . detention.\u201d See Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 728 (8th ed. 2004) (defining habeas corpus\nas \u201c[a] writ employed to bring a person before a court,\nmost frequently to ensure that the party\u2019s imprisonment\nor detention is not illegal\u201d). Petitioners argue, neverthe\u00ad\nless, that MCA \u00a77(b) is not a sufficiently clear statement of\ncongressional intent to strip the federal courts of jurisdic\u00ad\ntion in pending cases. See Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85,\n102\u2013103 (1869). We disagree.\n   Their argument is as follows: Section 2241(e)(1) refers to\n\u201ca writ of habeas corpus.\u201d             The next paragraph,\n\u00a72241(e)(2), refers to \u201cany other action . . . relating to any\naspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or condi\u00ad\ntions of confinement of an alien who . . . [has] been prop\u00ad\nerly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such\ndetermination.\u201d There are two separate paragraphs, the\nargument continues, so there must be two distinct classes\nof cases. And the effective date subsection, MCA \u00a77(b), it\nis said, refers only to the second class of cases, for it\nlargely repeats the language of \u00a72241(e)(2) by referring to\n\u201ccases . . . which relate to any aspect of the detention,\ntransfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of detention of an\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nalien detained by the United States.\u201d\n   Petitioners\u2019 textual argument would have more force\nwere it not for the phrase \u201cother action\u201d in \u00a72241(e)(2).\nThe phrase cannot be understood without referring back\nto the paragraph that precedes it, \u00a72241(e)(1), which\nexplicitly mentions the term \u201cwrit of habeas corpus.\u201d The\nstructure of the two paragraphs implies that habeas ac\u00ad\ntions are a type of action \u201crelating to any aspect of the\ndetention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of con\u00ad\nfinement of an alien who is or was detained . . . as an\nenemy combatant.\u201d Pending habeas actions, then, are in\nthe category of cases subject to the statute\u2019s jurisdictional\nbar.\n   We acknowledge, moreover, the litigation history that\nprompted Congress to enact the MCA. In Hamdan the\nCourt found it unnecessary to address the petitioner\u2019s\nSuspension Clause arguments but noted the relevance of\nthe clear statement rule in deciding whether Congress\nintended to reach pending habeas corpus cases. See 548\nU. S., at 575 (Congress should \u201cnot be presumed to have\neffected such denial [of habeas relief] absent an unmis\u00ad\ntakably clear statement to the contrary\u201d). This interpre\u00ad\ntive rule facilitates a dialogue between Congress and the\nCourt. Cf. Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways\nComm\u2019n, 502 U. S. 197, 206 (1991); H. Hart & A. Sacks,\nThe Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and\nApplication of Law 1209\u20131210 (W. Eskridge & P. Frickey\neds. 1994). If the Court invokes a clear statement rule to\nadvise that certain statutory interpretations are favored\nin order to avoid constitutional difficulties, Congress can\nmake an informed legislative choice either to amend the\nstatute or to retain its existing text. If Congress amends,\nits intent must be respected even if a difficult constitu\u00ad\ntional question is presented. The usual presumption is\nthat Members of Congress, in accord with their oath of\noffice, considered the constitutional issue and determined\n8                   BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe amended statute to be a lawful one; and the Judiciary,\nin light of that determination, proceeds to its own inde\u00ad\npendent judgment on the constitutional question when\nrequired to do so in a proper case.\n   If this ongoing dialogue between and among the\nbranches of Government is to be respected, we cannot\nignore that the MCA was a direct response to Hamdan\u2019s\nholding that the DTA\u2019s jurisdiction-stripping provision\nhad no application to pending cases. The Court of Appeals\nwas correct to take note of the legislative history when\nconstruing the statute, see 476 F. 3d, at 986, n. 2 (citing\nrelevant floor statements); and we agree with its conclu\u00ad\nsion that the MCA deprives the federal courts of jurisdic\u00ad\ntion to entertain the habeas corpus actions now before us.\n                              III\n   In deciding the constitutional questions now presented\nwe must determine whether petitioners are barred from\nseeking the writ or invoking the protections of the Suspen\u00ad\nsion Clause either because of their status, i.e., petitioners\u2019\ndesignation by the Executive Branch as enemy combat\u00ad\nants, or their physical location, i.e., their presence at\nGuantanamo Bay. The Government contends that non\u00ad\ncitizens designated as enemy combatants and detained in\nterritory located outside our Nation\u2019s borders have no\nconstitutional rights and no privilege of habeas corpus.\nPetitioners contend they do have cognizable constitutional\nrights and that Congress, in seeking to eliminate recourse\nto habeas corpus as a means to assert those rights, acted\nin violation of the Suspension Clause.\n   We begin with a brief account of the history and origins\nof the writ. Our account proceeds from two propositions.\nFirst, protection for the privilege of habeas corpus was one\nof the few safeguards of liberty specified in a Constitution\nthat, at the outset, had no Bill of Rights. In the system\nconceived by the Framers the writ had a centrality that\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmust inform proper interpretation of the Suspension\nClause. Second, to the extent there were settled prece\u00ad\ndents or legal commentaries in 1789 regarding the extra\u00ad\nterritorial scope of the writ or its application to enemy\naliens, those authorities can be instructive for the present\ncases.\n                              A\n   The Framers viewed freedom from unlawful restraint as\na fundamental precept of liberty, and they understood the\nwrit of habeas corpus as a vital instrument to secure that\nfreedom. Experience taught, however, that the common-\nlaw writ all too often had been insufficient to guard\nagainst the abuse of monarchial power. That history\ncounseled the necessity for specific language in the Consti\u00ad\ntution to secure the writ and ensure its place in our legal\nsystem.\n   Magna Carta decreed that no man would be imprisoned\ncontrary to the law of the land. Art. 39, in Sources of Our\nLiberties 17 (R. Perry & J. Cooper eds. 1959) (\u201cNo free\nman shall be taken or imprisoned or dispossessed, or\noutlawed, or banished, or in any way destroyed, nor will\nwe go upon him, nor send upon him, except by the legal\njudgment of his peers or by the law of the land\u201d). Impor\u00ad\ntant as the principle was, the Barons at Runnymede pre\u00ad\nscribed no specific legal process to enforce it. Holdsworth\ntells us, however, that gradually the writ of habeas corpus\nbecame the means by which the promise of Magna Carta\nwas fulfilled. 9 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law\n112 (1926) (hereinafter Holdsworth).\n   The development was painstaking, even by the centu\u00ad\nries-long measures of English constitutional history. The\nwrit was known and used in some form at least as early as\nthe reign of Edward I. Id., at 108\u2013125. Yet at the outset\nit was used to protect not the rights of citizens but those of\nthe King and his courts. The early courts were considered\n10                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagents of the Crown, designed to assist the King in the\nexercise of his power. See J. Baker, An Introduction to\nEnglish Legal History 38\u201339 (4th ed. 2002). Thus the\nwrit, while it would become part of the foundation of\nliberty for the King\u2019s subjects, was in its earliest use a\nmechanism for securing compliance with the King\u2019s\nlaws. See Halliday & White, The Suspension Clause:\nEnglish Text, Imperial Contexts, and American Impli\u00ad\ncations, 94 Va. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2008) (hereinafter\nHalliday & White) (manuscript, at 11, online at\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3 /papers.cfm?abstract_id=100\n8252 (all Internet materials as visited June 9, 2008, and\navailable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (noting that \u201cconcep\u00ad\ntually the writ arose from a theory of power rather than a\ntheory of liberty\u201d)). Over time it became clear that by\nissuing the writ of habeas corpus common-law courts\nsought to enforce the King\u2019s prerogative to inquire into the\nauthority of a jailer to hold a prisoner. See M. Hale, Pre\u00ad\nrogatives of the King 229 (D. Yale ed. 1976); 2 J. Story,\nCommentaries on the Constitution of the United States\n\u00a71341, p. 237 (3d ed. 1858) (noting that the writ ran \u201cinto\nall parts of the king\u2019s dominions; for it is said, that the\nking is entitled, at all times, to have an account, why the\nliberty of any of his subjects is restrained\u201d).\n   Even so, from an early date it was understood that the\nKing, too, was subject to the law. As the writers said of\nMagna Carta, \u201cit means this, that the king is and shall be\nbelow the law.\u201d 1 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, History of\nEnglish Law 173 (2d ed. 1909); see also 2 Bracton On the\nLaws and Customs of England 33 (S. Thorne transl. 1968)\n(\u201cThe king must not be under man but under God and\nunder the law, because law makes the king\u201d). And, by the\n1600\u2019s, the writ was deemed less an instrument of the\nKing\u2019s power and more a restraint upon it. See Collings,\nHabeas Corpus for Convicts\u2014Constitutional Right or\nLegislative Grace, 40 Calif. L. Rev. 335, 336 (1952) (noting\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat by this point the writ was \u201cthe appropriate process for\nchecking illegal imprisonment by public officials\u201d).\n  Still, the writ proved to be an imperfect check. Even\nwhen the importance of the writ was well understood in\nEngland, habeas relief often was denied by the courts or\nsuspended by Parliament. Denial or suspension occurred\nin times of political unrest, to the anguish of the impris\u00ad\noned and the outrage of those in sympathy with them.\n  A notable example from this period was Darnel\u2019s Case, 3\nHow. St. Tr. 1 (K. B. 1627). The events giving rise to the\ncase began when, in a display of the Stuart penchant for\nauthoritarian excess, Charles I demanded that Darnel and\nat least four others lend him money. Upon their refusal,\nthey were imprisoned. The prisoners sought a writ of\nhabeas corpus; and the King filed a return in the form of a\nwarrant signed by the Attorney General. Ibid. The court\nheld this was a sufficient answer and justified the sub\u00ad\njects\u2019 continued imprisonment. Id., at 59.\n  There was an immediate outcry of protest. The House of\nCommons promptly passed the Petition of Right, 3 Car. 1,\nch. 1 (1627), 5 Statutes of the Realm 23, 24 (reprint 1963),\nwhich condemned executive \u201cimprison[ment] without any\ncause\u201d shown, and declared that \u201cno freeman in any such\nmanner as is before mencioned [shall] be imprisoned or\ndeteined.\u201d Yet a full legislative response was long de\u00ad\nlayed. The King soon began to abuse his authority again,\nand Parliament was dissolved. See W. Hall & R. Albion, A\nHistory of England and the British Empire 328 (3d ed.\n1953) (hereinafter Hall & Albion). When Parliament\nreconvened in 1640, it sought to secure access to the writ\nby statute. The Act of 1640, 16 Car. 1, ch. 10, 5 Statutes of\nthe Realm, at 110, expressly authorized use of the writ to\ntest the legality of commitment by command or warrant of\nthe King or the Privy Council. Civil strife and the Inter\u00ad\nregnum soon followed, and not until 1679 did Parliament\ntry once more to secure the writ, this time through the\n12                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHabeas Corpus Act of 1679, 31 Car. 2, ch. 2, id., at 935.\nThe Act, which later would be described by Blackstone as\nthe \u201cstable bulwark of our liberties,\u201d 1 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries *137 (hereinafter Blackstone), established\nprocedures for issuing the writ; and it was the model upon\nwhich the habeas statutes of the 13 American Colonies\nwere based, see Collings, supra, at 338\u2013339.\n   This history was known to the Framers. It no doubt\nconfirmed their view that pendular swings to and away\nfrom individual liberty were endemic to undivided, uncon\u00ad\ntrolled power. The Framers\u2019 inherent distrust of govern\u00ad\nmental power was the driving force behind the constitu\u00ad\ntional plan that allocated powers among three\nindependent branches. This design serves not only to\nmake Government accountable but also to secure individ\u00ad\nual liberty. See Loving v. United States, 517 U. S. 748,\n756 (1996) (noting that \u201c[e]ven before the birth of this\ncountry, separation of powers was known to be a defense\nagainst tyranny\u201d); cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.\nSawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)\n(\u201c[T]he Constitution diffuses power the better to secure\nliberty\u201d); Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 450\n(1998) (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (\u201cLiberty is always at\nstake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress\nthe separation of powers\u201d). Because the Constitution\u2019s\nseparation-of-powers structure, like the substantive guar\u00ad\nantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, see Yick\nWo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 374 (1886), protects persons\nas well as citizens, foreign nationals who have the privi\u00ad\nlege of litigating in our courts can seek to enforce separa\u00ad\ntion-of-powers principles, see, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462\nU. S. 919, 958\u2013959 (1983).\n   That the Framers considered the writ a vital instrument\nfor the protection of individual liberty is evident from the\ncare taken to specify the limited grounds for its suspen\u00ad\nsion: \u201cThe Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbe suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Inva\u00ad\nsion the public Safety may require it.\u201d Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 2; see\nAmar, Of Sovereignty and Federalism, 96 Yale L. J. 1425,\n1509, n. 329 (1987) (\u201c[T]he non-suspension clause is the\noriginal Constitution\u2019s most explicit reference to reme\u00ad\ndies\u201d). The word \u201cprivilege\u201d was used, perhaps, to avoid\nmentioning some rights to the exclusion of others. (In\u00ad\ndeed, the only mention of the term \u201cright\u201d in the Constitu\u00ad\ntion, as ratified, is in its clause giving Congress the power\nto protect the rights of authors and inventors. See Art. I,\n\u00a78, cl. 8.)\n   Surviving accounts of the ratification debates provide\nadditional evidence that the Framers deemed the writ to\nbe an essential mechanism in the separation-of-powers\nscheme. In a critical exchange with Patrick Henry at the\nVirginia ratifying convention Edmund Randolph referred\nto the Suspension Clause as an \u201cexception\u201d to the \u201cpower\ngiven to Congress to regulate courts.\u201d See 3 Debates in\nthe Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the\nFederal Constitution 460\u2013464 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876) (here\u00ad\ninafter Elliot\u2019s Debates). A resolution passed by the New\nYork ratifying convention made clear its understanding\nthat the Clause not only protects against arbitrary sus\u00ad\npensions of the writ but also guarantees an affirmative\nright to judicial inquiry into the causes of detention. See\nResolution of the New York Ratifying Convention (July 26,\n1788), in 1 Elliot\u2019s Debates 328 (noting the convention\u2019s\nunderstanding \u201c[t]hat every person restrained of his lib\u00ad\nerty is entitled to an inquiry into the lawfulness of such\nrestraint, and to a removal thereof if unlawful; and that\nsuch inquiry or removal ought not to be denied or delayed,\nexcept when, on account of public danger, the Congress\nshall suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus\u201d).\nAlexander Hamilton likewise explained that by providing\nthe detainee a judicial forum to challenge detention, the\nwrit preserves limited government. As he explained in\n14                   BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Federalist No. 84:\n     \u201c[T]he practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have been,\n     in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instru\u00ad\n     ments of tyranny. The observations of the judicious\n     Blackstone . . . are well worthy of recital: \u2018To bereave\n     a man of life . . . or by violence to confiscate his estate,\n     without accusation or trial, would be so gross and no\u00ad\n     torious an act of despotism as must at once convey the\n     alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but\n     confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to\n     jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is\n     a less public, a less striking, and therefore a more\n     dangerous engine of arbitrary government.\u2019 And as a\n     remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly\n     emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas corpus\n     act, which in one place he calls \u2018the BULWARK of the\n     British Constitution.\u2019 \u201d C. Rossiter ed., p. 512 (1961)\n     (quoting 1 Blackstone *136, 4 id., at *438).\n   Post-1789 habeas developments in England, though not\nbearing upon the Framers\u2019 intent, do verify their foresight.\nThose later events would underscore the need for struc\u00ad\ntural barriers against arbitrary suspensions of the writ.\nJust as the writ had been vulnerable to executive and\nparliamentary encroachment on both sides of the Atlantic\nbefore the American Revolution, despite the Habeas Cor\u00ad\npus Act of 1679, the writ was suspended with frequency in\nEngland during times of political unrest after 1789. Par\u00ad\nliament suspended the writ for much of the period from\n1792 to 1801, resulting in rampant arbitrary imprison\u00ad\nment. See Hall & Albion 550. Even as late as World War\nI, at least one prominent English jurist complained that\nthe Defence of the Realm Act, 1914, 4 & 5 Geo. 5, ch.\n29(1)(a), effectively had suspended the privilege of habeas\ncorpus for any person suspected of \u201ccommunicating with\nthe enemy.\u201d See King v. Halliday, [1917] A. C. 260, 299\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(Lord Shaw, dissenting); see generally A. Simpson, In the\nHighest Degree Odious: Detention Without Trial in War\u00ad\ntime Britain 6\u20137, 24\u201325 (1992).\n   In our own system the Suspension Clause is designed to\nprotect against these cyclical abuses. The Clause protects\nthe rights of the detained by a means consistent with the\nessential design of the Constitution. It ensures that,\nexcept during periods of formal suspension, the Judiciary\nwill have a time-tested device, the writ, to maintain the\n\u201cdelicate balance of governance\u201d that is itself the surest\nsafeguard of liberty. See Hamdi, 542 U. S., at 536 (plural\u00ad\nity opinion). The Clause protects the rights of the de\u00ad\ntained by affirming the duty and authority of the Judici\u00ad\nary to call the jailer to account. See Preiser v. Rodriguez,\n411 U. S. 475, 484 (1973) (\u201c[T]he essence of habeas corpus\nis an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of\nthat custody\u201d); cf. In re Jackson, 15 Mich. 417, 439\u2013440\n(1867) (Cooley, J., concurring) (\u201cThe important fact to be\nobserved in regard to the mode of procedure upon this\n[habeas] writ is, that it is directed to, and served upon, not\nthe person confined, but his jailer\u201d). The separation-of\u00ad\npowers doctrine, and the history that influenced its de\u00ad\nsign, therefore must inform the reach and purpose of the\nSuspension Clause.\n                            B\n   The broad historical narrative of the writ and its func\u00ad\ntion is central to our analysis, but we seek guidance as\nwell from founding-era authorities addressing the specific\nquestion before us: whether foreign nationals, appre\u00ad\nhended and detained in distant countries during a time of\nserious threats to our Nation\u2019s security, may assert the\nprivilege of the writ and seek its protection. The Court\nhas been careful not to foreclose the possibility that the\nprotections of the Suspension Clause have expanded along\nwith post-1789 developments that define the present scope\n16                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof the writ. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 300\u2013301\n(2001). But the analysis may begin with precedents as of\n1789, for the Court has said that \u201cat the absolute mini\u00ad\nmum\u201d the Clause protects the writ as it existed when the\nConstitution was drafted and ratified. Id., at 301.\n   To support their arguments, the parties in these cases\nhave examined historical sources to construct a view of the\ncommon-law writ as it existed in 1789\u2014as have amici\nwhose expertise in legal history the Court has relied upon\nin the past. See Brief for Legal Historians as Amici Cu-\nriae; see also St. Cyr, supra, at 302, n. 16. The Govern\u00ad\nment argues the common-law writ ran only to those terri\u00ad\ntories over which the Crown was sovereign. See Brief for\nRespondents 27. Petitioners argue that jurisdiction fol\u00ad\nlowed the King\u2019s officers. See Brief for Petitioner Boume\u00ad\ndiene et al. 11. Diligent search by all parties reveals no\ncertain conclusions. In none of the cases cited do we find\nthat a common-law court would or would not have\ngranted, or refused to hear for lack of jurisdiction, a peti\u00ad\ntion for a writ of habeas corpus brought by a prisoner\ndeemed an enemy combatant, under a standard like the\none the Department of Defense has used in these cases,\nand when held in a territory, like Guantanamo, over\nwhich the Government has total military and civil control.\n   We know that at common law a petitioner\u2019s status as an\nalien was not a categorical bar to habeas corpus relief.\nSee, e.g., Sommersett\u2019s Case, 20 How. St. Tr. 1, 80\u201382\n(1772) (ordering an African slave freed upon finding the\ncustodian\u2019s return insufficient); see generally Khera v.\nSecretary of State for the Home Dept., [1984] A. C. 74, 111\n(\u201cHabeas corpus protection is often expressed as limited to\n\u2018British subjects.\u2019 Is it really limited to British nationals?\nSuffice it to say that the case law has given an emphatic\n\u2018no\u2019 to the question\u201d). We know as well that common-law\ncourts entertained habeas petitions brought by enemy\naliens detained in England\u2014\u201centertained\u201d at least in the\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

See Case of\nThree Spanish Sailors, 2 Black. W. 1324, 96 Eng. Rep. 775\n(C. P. 1779); King v. Schiever, 2 Burr. 765, 97 Eng. Rep.\n551 (K. B. 1759); Du Castro\u2019s Case, Fort. 195, 92 Eng. Rep.\n816 (K. B. 1697).\n   In Schiever and the Spanish Sailors\u2019 case, the courts\ndenied relief to the petitioners. Whether the holdings in\nthese cases were jurisdictional or based upon the courts\u2019\nruling that the petitioners were detained lawfully as\nprisoners of war is unclear. See Spanish Sailors, supra, at\n1324, 96 Eng. Rep., at 776; Schiever, supra, at 766, 97\nEng. Rep., at 552. In Du Castro\u2019s Case, the court granted\nrelief, but that case is not analogous to petitioners\u2019 be\u00ad\ncause the prisoner there appears to have been detained in\nEngland. See Halliday & White 27, n. 72. To the extent\nthese authorities suggest the common-law courts ab\u00ad\nstained altogether from matters involving prisoners of\nwar, there was greater justification for doing so in the\ncontext of declared wars with other nation states. Judicial\nintervention might have complicated the military\u2019s ability\nto negotiate exchange of prisoners with the enemy, a\nwartime practice well known to the Framers. See Resolu\u00ad\ntion of Mar. 30, 1778, 10 Journals of the Continental\nCongress 1774\u20131789, p. 295 (W. Ford ed. 1908) (directing\nGeneral Washington not to exchange prisoners with the\nBritish unless the enemy agreed to exempt citizens from\ncapture).\n   We find the evidence as to the geographic scope of the\nwrit at common law informative, but, again, not disposi\u00ad\ntive. Petitioners argue the site of their detention is analo\u00ad\ngous to two territories outside of England to which the\nwrit did run: the so-called \u201cexempt jurisdictions,\u201d like the\nChannel Islands; and (in former times) India. There are\ncritical differences between these places and Guantanamo,\nhowever.\n18                BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n   As the Court noted in Rasul, 542 U. S., at 481\u2013482, and\nnn. 11\u201312, common-law courts granted habeas corpus\nrelief to prisoners detained in the exempt jurisdictions.\nBut these areas, while not in theory part of the realm of\nEngland, were nonetheless under the Crown\u2019s control. See\n2 H. Hallam, Constitutional History of England: From the\nAccession of Henry VII to the Death of George II, pp. 232\u2013\n233 (reprint 1989). And there is some indication that\nthese jurisdictions were considered sovereign territory.\nKing v. Cowle, 2 Burr. 834, 854, 855, 97 Eng. Rep. 587,\n599 (K. B. 1759) (describing one of the exempt jurisdic\u00ad\ntions, Berwick-upon-Tweed, as under the \u201csovereign juris\u00ad\ndiction\u201d and \u201csubjection of the Crown of England\u201d). Be\u00ad\ncause the United States does not maintain formal\nsovereignty over Guantanamo Bay, see Part IV, infra, the\nnaval station there and the exempt jurisdictions discussed\nin the English authorities are not similarly situated.\n   Petitioners and their amici further rely on cases in\nwhich British courts in India granted writs of habeas\ncorpus to noncitizens detained in territory over which the\nMoghul Emperor retained formal sovereignty and control.\nSee supra, at 12\u201313; Brief for Legal Historians as Amici\nCuriae 12\u201313. The analogy to the present cases breaks\ndown, however, because of the geographic location of the\ncourts in the Indian example. The Supreme Court of\nJudicature (the British Court) sat in Calcutta; but no\nfederal court sits at Guantanamo. The Supreme Court of\nJudicature was, moreover, a special court set up by Par\u00ad\nliament to monitor certain conduct during the British Raj.\nSee Regulating Act of 1773, 13 Geo. 3, \u00a7\u00a713\u201314. That it\nhad the power to issue the writ in nonsovereign territory\ndoes not prove that common-law courts sitting in England\nhad the same power. If petitioners were to have the better\nof the argument on this point, we would need some dem\u00ad\nonstration of a consistent practice of common-law courts\nsitting in England and entertaining petitions brought by\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nalien prisoners detained abroad. We find little support for\nthis conclusion.\n   The Government argues, in turn, that Guantanamo is\nmore closely analogous to Scotland and Hanover, territo\u00ad\nries that were not part of England but nonetheless con\u00ad\ntrolled by the English monarch (in his separate capacities\nas King of Scotland and Elector of Hanover). See Cowle, 2\nBurr., at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 600. Lord Mansfield can be\ncited for the proposition that, at the time of the founding,\nEnglish courts lacked the \u201cpower\u201d to issue the writ to\nScotland and Hanover, territories Lord Mansfield referred\nto as \u201cforeign.\u201d Ibid. But what matters for our purposes is\nwhy common-law courts lacked this power. Given the\nEnglish Crown\u2019s delicate and complicated relationships\nwith Scotland and Hanover in the 1700\u2019s, we cannot disre\u00ad\ngard the possibility that the common-law courts\u2019 refusal to\nissue the writ to these places was motivated not by formal\nlegal constructs but by what we would think of as pruden\u00ad\ntial concerns. This appears to have been the case with\nregard to other British territories where the writ did not\nrun. See 2 R. Chambers, A Course of Lectures on English\nLaw 1767\u20131773, p. 8 (T. Curley ed. 1986) (quoting the\nview of Lord Mansfield in Cowle that \u201c[n]otwithstanding\nthe power which the judges have, yet where they cannot\njudge of the cause, or give relief upon it, they would not\nthink proper to interpose; and therefore in the case of\nimprisonments in Guernsey, Jersey, Minorca, or the plan-\ntations, the most usual way is to complain to the king in\nCouncil\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). And after\nthe Act of Union in 1707, through which the kingdoms of\nEngland and Scotland were merged politically, Queen\nAnne and her successors, in their new capacity as sover\u00ad\neign of Great Britain, ruled the entire island as one king\u00ad\ndom. Accordingly, by the time Lord Mansfield penned his\nopinion in Cowle in 1759, Scotland was no longer a \u201cfor\u00ad\neign\u201d country vis-\u00e0-vis England\u2014at least not in the sense\n20                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin which Cuba is a foreign country vis-\u00e0-vis the United\nStates.\n   Scotland remained \u201cforeign\u201d in Lord Mansfield\u2019s day in\nat least one important respect, however. Even after the\nAct of Union, Scotland (like Hanover) continued to main\u00ad\ntain its own laws and court system. See 1 Blackstone *98,\n*109. Under these circumstances prudential considera\u00ad\ntions would have weighed heavily when courts sitting in\nEngland received habeas petitions from Scotland or the\nElectorate. Common-law decisions withholding the writ\nfrom prisoners detained in these places easily could be\nexplained as efforts to avoid either or both of two embar\u00ad\nrassments: conflict with the judgments of another court of\ncompetent jurisdiction; or the practical inability, by reason\nof distance, of the English courts to enforce their judg\u00ad\nments outside their territorial jurisdiction. Cf. Munaf v.\nGeren, ante, at 15 (opinion of the Court) (recognizing that\n\u201c \u2018prudential concerns\u2019 . . . such as comity and the orderly\nadministration of criminal justice\u201d affect the appropriate\nexercise of habeas jurisdiction).\n   By the mid-19th century, British courts could issue the\nwrit to Canada, notwithstanding the fact that Canadian\ncourts also had the power to do so. See 9 Holdsworth 124\n(citing Ex parte Anderson, 3 El. and El. 487 (1861)). This\nmight be seen as evidence that the existence of a separate\ncourt system was no barrier to the running of the common-\nlaw writ. The Canada of the 1800\u2019s, however, was in\nmany respects more analogous to the exempt jurisdictions\nor to Ireland, where the writ ran, than to Scotland or\nHanover in the 1700\u2019s, where it did not. Unlike Scotland\nand Hanover, Canada followed English law. See B.\nLaskin, The British Tradition in Canadian Law 50\u201351\n(1969).\n   In the end a categorical or formal conception of sover\u00ad\neignty does not provide a comprehensive or altogether\nsatisfactory explanation for the general understanding\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)          21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat prevailed when Lord Mansfield considered issuance of\nthe writ outside England. In 1759 the writ did not run to\nScotland but did run to Ireland, even though, at that\npoint, Scotland and England had merged under the rule of\na single sovereign, whereas the Crowns of Great Britain\nand Ireland remained separate (at least in theory). See\nCowle, supra, at 856\u2013857, 97 Eng. Rep., 600; 1 Blackstone\n*100\u2013101. But there was at least one major difference\nbetween Scotland\u2019s and Ireland\u2019s relationship with Eng\u00ad\nland during this period that might explain why the writ\nran to Ireland but not to Scotland. English law did not\ngenerally apply in Scotland (even after the Act of Union)\nbut it did apply in Ireland. Blackstone put it as follows:\n\u201c[A]s Scotland and England are now one and the same\nkingdom, and yet differ in their municipal laws; so Eng\u00ad\nland and Ireland are, on the other hand, distinct king\u00ad\ndoms, and yet in general agree in their laws.\u201d Id., at *100.\nThis distinction, and not formal notions of sovereignty,\nmay well explain why the writ did not run to Scotland\n(and Hanover) but would run to Ireland.\n   The prudential barriers that may have prevented the\nEnglish courts from issuing the writ to Scotland and\nHanover are not relevant here. We have no reason to\nbelieve an order from a federal court would be disobeyed\nat Guantanamo. No Cuban court has jurisdiction to hear\nthese petitioners\u2019 claims, and no law other than the laws\nof the United States applies at the naval station. The\nmodern-day relations between the United States and\nGuantanamo thus differ in important respects from the\n18th-century relations between England and the kingdoms\nof Scotland and Hanover. This is reason enough for us to\ndiscount the relevance of the Government\u2019s analogy.\n   Each side in the present matter argues that the very\nlack of a precedent on point supports its position. The\nGovernment points out there is no evidence that a court\nsitting in England granted habeas relief to an enemy alien\n22                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndetained abroad; petitioners respond there is no evidence\nthat a court refused to do so for lack of jurisdiction.\n   Both arguments are premised, however, upon the as\u00ad\nsumption that the historical record is complete and that\nthe common law, if properly understood, yields a definite\nanswer to the questions before us. There are reasons to\ndoubt both assumptions. Recent scholarship points to the\ninherent shortcomings in the historical record. See Halli\u00ad\nday & White 14\u201315 (noting that most reports of 18th\u00ad\ncentury habeas proceedings were not printed). And given\nthe unique status of Guantanamo Bay and the particular\ndangers of terrorism in the modern age, the common-law\ncourts simply may not have confronted cases with close\nparallels to this one. We decline, therefore, to infer too\nmuch, one way or the other, from the lack of historical\nevidence on point. Cf. Brown v. Board of Education, 347\nU. S. 483, 489 (1954) (noting evidence concerning the\ncircumstances surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, discussed in the parties\u2019 briefs and uncov\u00ad\nered through the Court\u2019s own investigation, \u201cconvince us\nthat, although these sources cast some light, it is not\nenough to resolve the problem with which we are faced.\nAt best, they are inconclusive\u201d); Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S.\n1, 64 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result) (argu\u00ad\ning constitutional adjudication should not be based upon\nevidence that is \u201ctoo episodic, too meager, to form a solid\nbasis in history, preceding and contemporaneous with the\nframing of the Constitution\u201d).\n                            IV\n  Drawing from its position that at common law the writ\nran only to territories over which the Crown was sover\u00ad\neign, the Government says the Suspension Clause affords\npetitioners no rights because the United States does not\nclaim sovereignty over the place of detention.\n  Guantanamo Bay is not formally part of the United\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

And under the\nterms of the lease between the United States and Cuba,\nCuba retains \u201cultimate sovereignty\u201d over the territory\nwhile the United States exercises \u201ccomplete jurisdiction\nand control.\u201d See Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval\nStations, Feb. 23, 1903, U. S.-Cuba, Art. III, T. S. No. 418\n(hereinafter 1903 Lease Agreement); Rasul, 542 U. S., at\n471. Under the terms of the 1934 Treaty, however, Cuba\neffectively has no rights as a sovereign until the parties\nagree to modification of the 1903 Lease Agreement or the\nUnited States abandons the base. See Treaty Defining\nRelations with Cuba, May 29, 1934, U. S.-Cuba, Art. III,\n48 Stat. 1683, T. S. No. 866.\n  The United States contends, nevertheless, that Guan\u00ad\ntanamo is not within its sovereign control. This was the\nGovernment\u2019s position well before the events of September\n11, 2001. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners in Sale v. Haitian\nCenters Council, Inc., O. T. 1992, No. 92\u2013344, p. 31 (argu\u00ad\ning that Guantanamo is territory \u201coutside the United\nStates\u201d). And in other contexts the Court has held that\nquestions of sovereignty are for the political branches to\ndecide. See Vermilya-Brown Co. v. Connell, 335 U. S. 377,\n380 (1948) (\u201c[D]etermination of sovereignty over an area is\nfor the legislative and executive departments\u201d); see also\nJones v. United States, 137 U. S. 202 (1890); Williams v.\nSuffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415, 420 (1839). Even if this were\na treaty interpretation case that did not involve a political\nquestion, the President\u2019s construction of the lease agree\u00ad\nment would be entitled to great respect. See Sumitomo\nShoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 184\u2013185\n(1982).\n  We therefore do not question the Government\u2019s position\nthat Cuba, not the United States, maintains sovereignty,\nin the legal and technical sense of the term, over Guan\u00ad\ntanamo Bay. But this does not end the analysis. Our\ncases do not hold it is improper for us to inquire into the\n24                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nobjective degree of control the Nation asserts over foreign\nterritory. As commentators have noted, \u201c \u2018[s]overeignty\u2019 is\na term used in many senses and is much abused. \u201d See 1\nRestatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the\nUnited States \u00a7206, Comment b, p. 94 (1986). When we\nhave stated that sovereignty is a political question, we\nhave referred not to sovereignty in the general, colloquial\nsense, meaning the exercise of dominion or power, see\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary 2406 (2d ed.\n1934) (\u201csovereignty,\u201d definition 3), but sovereignty in the\nnarrow, legal sense of the term, meaning a claim of right,\nsee 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations, supra,\n\u00a7206, Comment b, at 94 (noting that sovereignty \u201cimplies\na state\u2019s lawful control over its territory generally to the\nexclusion of other states, authority to govern in that terri\u00ad\ntory, and authority to apply law there\u201d). Indeed, it is not\naltogether uncommon for a territory to be under the de\njure sovereignty of one nation, while under the plenary\ncontrol, or practical sovereignty, of another. This condi\u00ad\ntion can occur when the territory is seized during war, as\nGuantanamo was during the Spanish-American War. See,\ne.g., Fleming v. Page, 9 How. 603, 614 (1850) (noting that\nthe port of Tampico, conquered by the United States dur\u00ad\ning the war with Mexico, was \u201cundoubtedly . . . subject to\nthe sovereignty and dominion of the United States,\u201d but\nthat it \u201cdoes not follow that it was a part of the United\nStates, or that it ceased to be a foreign country\u201d); King v.\nEarl of Crewe ex parte Sekgome, [1910] 2 K.

Accordingly, for purposes of our analysis,\nwe accept the Government\u2019s position that Cuba, and not\nthe United States, retains de jure sovereignty over Guan\u00ad\ntanamo Bay.

S., at 480; id., at 487 (KENNEDY, J., concurring\nin judgment).\n   Were we to hold that the present cases turn on the\npolitical question doctrine, we would be required first to\naccept the Government\u2019s premise that de jure sovereignty\nis the touchstone of habeas corpus jurisdiction. This\npremise, however, is unfounded. For the reasons indi\u00ad\ncated above, the history of common-law habeas corpus\nprovides scant support for this proposition; and, for the\nreasons indicated below, that position would be inconsis\u00ad\ntent with our precedents and contrary to fundamental\nseparation-of-powers principles.\n                              A\n   The Court has discussed the issue of the Constitution\u2019s\nextraterritorial application on many occasions. These\ndecisions undermine the Government\u2019s argument that, at\nleast as applied to noncitizens, the Constitution necessar\u00ad\nily stops where de jure sovereignty ends.\n   The Framers foresaw that the United States would\nexpand and acquire new territories. See American Ins. Co.\nv. 356 Bales of Cotton, 1 Pet. 511, 542 (1828). Article IV,\n\u00a73, cl. 1, grants Congress the power to admit new States.\nClause 2 of the same section grants Congress the \u201cPower\nto dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations\nrespecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the\nUnited States.\u201d Save for a few notable (and notorious)\nexceptions, e.g., Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393\n(1857), throughout most of our history there was little\nneed to explore the outer boundaries of the Constitution\u2019s\ngeographic reach. When Congress exercised its power to\ncreate new territories, it guaranteed constitutional protec\u00ad\ntions to the inhabitants by statute. See, e.g., An Act: to\n26                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nestablish a Territorial Government for Utah, 9 Stat. 458\n(\u201c[T]he Constitution and laws of the United States are\nhereby extended over and declared to be in force in said\nTerritory of Utah\u201d); Rev. Stat. \u00a71891 (\u201cThe Constitution\nand all laws of the United States which are not locally\ninapplicable shall have the same force and effect within all\nthe organized Territories, and in every Territory hereafter\norganized as elsewhere within the United States\u201d); see\ngenerally Burnett, Untied States: American Expansion\nand Territorial Deannexation, 72 U. Chi. L. Rev. 797, 825\u2013\n827 (2005). In particular, there was no need to test the\nlimits of the Suspension Clause because, as early as 1789,\nCongress extended the writ to the Territories. See Act of\nAug. 7, 1789, 1 Stat. 52 (reaffirming Art. II of Northwest\nOrdinance of 1787, which provided that \u201c[t]he inhabitants\nof the said territory, shall always be entitled to the bene\u00ad\nfits of the writ of habeas corpus\u201d).\n   Fundamental questions regarding the Constitution\u2019s\ngeographic scope first arose at the dawn of the 20th cen\u00ad\ntury when the Nation acquired noncontiguous Territories:\nPuerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines\u2014ceded to the\nUnited States by Spain at the conclusion of the Spanish-\nAmerican War\u2014and Hawaii\u2014annexed by the United\nStates in 1898. At this point Congress chose to discon\u00ad\ntinue its previous practice of extending constitutional\nrights to the territories by statute. See, e.g., An Act Tem\u00ad\nporarily to provide for the administration of the affairs of\ncivil government in the Philippine Islands, and for other\npurposes, 32 Stat. 692 (noting that Rev. Stat. \u00a71891 did\nnot apply to the Philippines).\n   In a series of opinions later known as the Insular Cases,\nthe Court addressed whether the Constitution, by its own\nforce, applies in any territory that is not a State. See De\nLima v. Bidwell, 182 U. S. 1 (1901); Dooley v. United\nStates, 182 U. S. 222 (1901); Armstrong v. United States,\n182 U. S. 243 (1901); Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U. S. 244\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(1901); Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U. S. 197 (1903); Dorr v.\nUnited States, 195 U. S. 138 (1904). The Court held that\nthe Constitution has independent force in these territo\u00ad\nries, a force not contingent upon acts of legislative grace.\nYet it took note of the difficulties inherent in that position.\n   Prior to their cession to the United States, the former\nSpanish colonies operated under a civil-law system, with\u00ad\nout experience in the various aspects of the Anglo-\nAmerican legal tradition, for instance the use of grand and\npetit juries. At least with regard to the Philippines, a\ncomplete transformation of the prevailing legal culture\nwould have been not only disruptive but also unnecessary,\nas the United States intended to grant independence to\nthat Territory. See An Act To declare the purpose of the\npeople of the United States as to the future political status\nof the people of the Philippine Islands, and to provide a\nmore autonomous government for those islands (Jones\nAct), 39 Stat. 545 (noting that \u201cit was never the intention\nof the people of the United States in the incipiency of the\nWar with Spain to make it a war of conquest or for territo\u00ad\nrial aggrandizement\u201d and that \u201cit is, as it has always been,\nthe purpose of the people of the United States to withdraw\ntheir sovereignty over the Philippine Islands and to recog\u00ad\nnize their independence as soon as a stable government\ncan be established therein\u201d). The Court thus was reluc\u00ad\ntant to risk the uncertainty and instability that could\nresult from a rule that displaced altogether the existing\nlegal systems in these newly acquired Territories. See\nDownes, supra, at 282 (\u201cIt is obvious that in the annexa\u00ad\ntion of outlying and distant possessions grave questions\nwill arise from differences of race, habits, laws and cus\u00ad\ntoms of the people, and from differences of soil, climate\nand production . . . \u201d).\n   These considerations resulted in the doctrine of territo\u00ad\nrial incorporation, under which the Constitution applies in\nfull in incorporated Territories surely destined for state\u00ad\n28                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhood but only in part in unincorporated Territories. See\nDorr, supra, at 143 (\u201cUntil Congress shall see fit to incor\u00ad\nporate territory ceded by treaty into the United States, . . .\nthe territory is to be governed under the power existing in\nCongress to make laws for such territories and subject to\nsuch constitutional restrictions upon the powers of that\nbody as are applicable to the situation\u201d); Downes, supra, at\n293 (White, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he determination of what\nparticular provision of the Constitution is applicable,\ngenerally speaking, in all cases, involves an inquiry into\nthe situation of the territory and its relations to the\nUnited States\u201d). As the Court later made clear, \u201cthe real\nissue in the Insular Cases was not whether the Constitu\u00ad\ntion extended to the Philippines or Porto Rico when we\nwent there, but which of its provisions were applicable by\nway of limitation upon the exercise of executive and legis\u00ad\nlative power in dealing with new conditions and require\u00ad\nments.\u201d Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U. S. 298, 312 (1922). It\nmay well be that over time the ties between the United\nStates and any of its unincorporated Territories\nstrengthen in ways that are of constitutional significance.\nCf. Torres v. Puerto Rico, 442 U. S. 465, 475\u2013476 (1979)\n(Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cWhatever the\nvalidity of the [Insular Cases] in the particular historical\ncontext in which they were decided, those cases are clearly\nnot authority for questioning the application of the Fourth\nAmendment\u2014or any other provision of the Bill of Rights\u2014\nto the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in the 1970\u2019s\u201d). But,\nas early as Balzac in 1922, the Court took for granted that\neven in unincorporated Territories the Government of the\nUnited States was bound to provide to noncitizen inhabi\u00ad\ntants \u201cguaranties of certain fundamental personal rights\ndeclared in the Constitution.\u201d 258 U. S., at 312; see also\nLate Corp. of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nv. United States, 136 U. S. 1, 44 (1890) (\u201cDoubtless Con\u00ad\ngress, in legislating for the Territories would be subject to\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)          29\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthose fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights\nwhich are formulated in the Constitution and its amend\u00ad\nments\u201d). Yet noting the inherent practical difficulties of\nenforcing all constitutional provisions \u201calways and every\u00ad\nwhere,\u201d Balzac, supra, at 312, the Court devised in the\nInsular Cases a doctrine that allowed it to use its power\nsparingly and where it would be most needed. This cen\u00ad\ntury-old doctrine informs our analysis in the present\nmatter.\n   Practical considerations likewise influenced the Court\u2019s\nanalysis a half-century later in Reid, 354 U. S. 1. The\npetitioners there, spouses of American servicemen, lived\non American military bases in England and Japan. They\nwere charged with crimes committed in those countries\nand tried before military courts, consistent with executive\nagreements the United States had entered into with the\nBritish and Japanese governments. Id., at 15\u201316, and nn.\n29\u201330 (plurality opinion). Because the petitioners were\nnot themselves military personnel, they argued they were\nentitled to trial by jury.\n   Justice Black, writing for the plurality, contrasted the\ncases before him with the Insular Cases, which involved\nterritories \u201cwith wholly dissimilar traditions and institu\u00ad\ntions\u201d that Congress intended to govern only \u201ctemporar\u00ad\nily.\u201d Id., at 14. Justice Frankfurter argued that the \u201cspe\u00ad\ncific circumstances of each particular case\u201d are relevant in\ndetermining the geographic scope of the Constitution. Id.,\nat 54 (opinion concurring in result). And Justice Harlan,\nwho had joined an opinion reaching the opposite result in\nthe case in the previous Term, Reid v. Covert, 351 U. S.\n487 (1956), was most explicit in rejecting a \u201crigid and\nabstract rule\u201d for determining where constitutional guar\u00ad\nantees extend. Reid, 354 U. S., at 74 (opinion concurring\nin result). He read the Insular Cases to teach that\nwhether a constitutional provision has extraterritorial\neffect depends upon the \u201cparticular circumstances, the\n30                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npractical necessities, and the possible alternatives which\nCongress had before it\u201d and, in particular, whether judi\u00ad\ncial enforcement of the provision would be \u201cimpracticable\nand anomalous.\u201d Id., at 74\u201375; see also United States v.\nVerdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 277\u2013278 (1990)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring) (applying the \u201cimpracticable\nand anomalous\u201d extraterritoriality test in the Fourth\nAmendment context).\n   That the petitioners in Reid were American citizens was\na key factor in the case and was central to the plurality\u2019s\nconclusion that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments apply to\nAmerican civilians tried outside the United States. But\npractical considerations, related not to the petitioners\u2019\ncitizenship but to the place of their confinement and trial,\nwere relevant to each Member of the Reid majority. And\nto Justices Harlan and Frankfurter (whose votes were\nnecessary to the Court\u2019s disposition) these considerations\nwere the decisive factors in the case.\n   Indeed the majority splintered on this very point. The\nkey disagreement between the plurality and the concur\u00ad\nring Justices in Reid was over the continued precedential\nvalue of the Court\u2019s previous opinion in In re Ross, 140\nU. S. 453 (1891), which the Reid Court understood as\nholding that under some circumstances Americans abroad\nhave no right to indictment and trial by jury. The peti\u00ad\ntioner in Ross was a sailor serving on an American mer\u00ad\nchant vessel in Japanese waters who was tried before an\nAmerican consular tribunal for the murder of a fellow\ncrewman. 140 U. S., at 459, 479. The Ross Court held\nthat the petitioner, who was a British subject, had no\nrights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Id., at 464.\nThe petitioner\u2019s citizenship played no role in the disposi\u00ad\ntion of the case, however. The Court assumed (consistent\nwith the maritime custom of the time) that Ross had all\nthe rights of a similarly situated American citizen. Id., at\n479 (noting that Ross was \u201cunder the protection and sub\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nject to the laws of the United States equally with the\nseaman who was native born\u201d). The Justices in Reid\ntherefore properly understood Ross as standing for the\nproposition that, at least in some circumstances, the jury\nprovisions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments have no\napplication to American citizens tried by American au\u00ad\nthorities abroad. See 354 U. S., at 11\u201312 (plurality opin\u00ad\nion) (describing Ross as holding that \u201cconstitutional pro\u00ad\ntections applied \u2018only to citizens and others within the\nUnited States . . . and not to residents or temporary so\u00ad\njourners abroad\u2019 \u201d (quoting Ross, supra, at 464)); 354 U. S.,\nat 64 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result) (noting that\nthe consular tribunals upheld in Ross \u201cw[ere] based on\nlong-established custom and they were justified as the\nbest possible means for securing justice for the few Ameri\u00ad\ncans present in [foreign] countries\u201d); 354 U. S., at 75\n(Harlan, J., concurring in result) (\u201cwhat Ross and the\nInsular Cases hold is that the particular local setting, the\npractical necessities, and the possible alternatives are\nrelevant to a question of judgment, namely, whether jury\ntrial should be deemed a necessary condition of the exer\u00ad\ncise of Congress\u2019 power to provide for the trial of Ameri\u00ad\ncans overseas\u201d).\n   The Reid plurality doubted that Ross was rightly de\u00ad\ncided, precisely because it believed the opinion was insuf\u00ad\nficiently protective of the rights of American citizens. See\n354 U. S., at 10\u201312; see also id., at 78 (Clark, J., dissent\u00ad\ning) (noting that \u201cfour of my brothers would specifically\noverrule and two would impair the long-recognized vitality\nof an old and respected precedent in our law, the case of In\nre Ross, 140 U. S. 453 (1891)\u201d). But Justices Harlan and\nFrankfurter, while willing to hold that the American\ncitizen petitioners in the cases before them were entitled\nto the protections of Fifth and Sixth Amendments, were\nunwilling to overturn Ross. 354 U. S., at 64 (Frankfurter,\nJ., concurring in result); id., at 75 (Harlan, J., concurring\n32                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin result). Instead, the two concurring Justices distin\u00ad\nguished Ross from the cases before them, not on the basis\nof the citizenship of the petitioners, but on practical con\u00ad\nsiderations that made jury trial a more feasible option for\nthem than it was for the petitioner in Ross. If citizenship\nhad been the only relevant factor in the case, it would\nhave been necessary for the Court to overturn Ross, some\u00ad\nthing Justices Harlan and Frankfurter were unwilling to\ndo. See Verdugo-Urquidez, supra, at 277 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring) (noting that Ross had not been overruled).\n  Practical considerations weighed heavily as well in\nJohnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 (1950), where the\nCourt addressed whether habeas corpus jurisdiction ex\u00ad\ntended to enemy aliens who had been convicted of violat\u00ad\ning the laws of war. The prisoners were detained at\nLandsberg Prison in Germany during the Allied Powers\u2019\npostwar occupation. The Court stressed the difficulties of\nordering the Government to produce the prisoners in a\nhabeas corpus proceeding. It \u201cwould require allocation of\nshipping space, guarding personnel, billeting and rations\u201d\nand would damage the prestige of military commanders at\na sensitive time. Id., at 779. In considering these factors\nthe Court sought to balance the constraints of military\noccupation with constitutional necessities. Id., at 769\u2013\n779; see Rasul, 542 U. S., at 475\u2013476 (discussing the\nfactors relevant to Eisentrager\u2019s constitutional holding);\n542 U. S., at 486 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment)\n(same).\n  True, the Court in Eisentrager denied access to the writ,\nand it noted the prisoners \u201cat no relevant time were\nwithin any territory over which the United States is sov\u00ad\nereign, and [that] the scenes of their offense, their capture,\ntheir trial and their punishment were all beyond the\nterritorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.\u201d\n339 U. S., at 778. The Government seizes upon this lan\u00ad\nguage as proof positive that the Eisentrager Court adopted\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           33\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na formalistic, sovereignty-based test for determining the\nreach of the Suspension Clause. See Brief for Respon\u00ad\ndents 18\u201320. We reject this reading for three reasons.\n   First, we do not accept the idea that the above-quoted\npassage from Eisentrager is the only authoritative lan\u00ad\nguage in the opinion and that all the rest is dicta. The\nCourt\u2019s further determinations, based on practical consid\u00ad\nerations, were integral to Part II of its opinion and came\nbefore the decision announced its holding. See 339 U. S.,\nat 781.\n   Second, because the United States lacked both de jure\nsovereignty and plenary control over Landsberg Prison,\nsee infra, at 34\u201335, it is far from clear that the Eisentrager\nCourt used the term sovereignty only in the narrow tech\u00ad\nnical sense and not to connote the degree of control the\nmilitary asserted over the facility. See supra, at 21. The\nJustices who decided Eisentrager would have understood\nsovereignty as a multifaceted concept. See Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1568 (4th ed. 1951) (defining \u201csovereignty\u201d as\n\u201c[t]he supreme, absolute, and uncontrollable power by\nwhich any independent state is governed\u201d; \u201cthe interna\u00ad\ntional independence of a state, combined with the right\nand power of regulating its internal affairs without foreign\ndictation\u201d; and \u201c[t]he power to do everything in a state\nwithout accountability\u201d); Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary with\nPronunciations 1216 (2d ed. 1948) (defining \u201csovereignty\u201d\nas \u201c[t]hat public authority which commands in civil soci\u00ad\nety, and orders and directs what each citizen is to perform\nto obtain the end of its institution\u201d). In its principal brief\nin Eisentrager, the Government advocated a bright-line\ntest for determining the scope of the writ, similar to the\none it advocates in these cases. See Brief for Petitioners in\nJohnson v. Eisentrager, O. T. 1949, No. 306, pp. 74\u201375.\nYet the Court mentioned the concept of territorial sover\u00ad\neignty only twice in its opinion. See Eisentrager, supra, at\n778, 780. That the Court devoted a significant portion of\n34                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPart II to a discussion of practical barriers to the running\nof the writ suggests that the Court was not concerned\nexclusively with the formal legal status of Landsberg\nPrison but also with the objective degree of control the\nUnited States asserted over it. Even if we assume the\nEisentrager Court considered the United States\u2019 lack of\nformal legal sovereignty over Landsberg Prison as the\ndecisive factor in that case, its holding is not inconsistent\nwith a functional approach to questions of extraterritorial\u00ad\nity. The formal legal status of a given territory affects, at\nleast to some extent, the political branches\u2019 control over\nthat territory. De jure sovereignty is a factor that bears\nupon which constitutional guarantees apply there.\n   Third, if the Government\u2019s reading of Eisentrager were\ncorrect, the opinion would have marked not only a change\nin, but a complete repudiation of, the Insular Cases\u2019 (and\nlater Reid\u2019s) functional approach to questions of extrater\u00ad\nritoriality. We cannot accept the Government\u2019s view.\nNothing in Eisentrager says that de jure sovereignty is or\nhas ever been the only relevant consideration in determin\u00ad\ning the geographic reach of the Constitution or of habeas\ncorpus. Were that the case, there would be considerable\ntension between Eisentrager, on the one hand, and the\nInsular Cases and Reid, on the other. Our cases need not\nbe read to conflict in this manner. A constricted reading of\nEisentrager overlooks what we see as a common thread\nuniting the Insular Cases, Eisentrager, and Reid: the idea\nthat questions of extraterritoriality turn on objective\nfactors and practical concerns, not formalism.\n                             B\n  The Government\u2019s formal sovereignty-based test raises\ntroubling separation-of-powers concerns as well. The\npolitical history of Guantanamo illustrates the deficiencies\nof this approach. The United States has maintained\ncomplete and uninterrupted control of the bay for over 100\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           35\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nyears. At the close of the Spanish-American War, Spain\nceded control over the entire island of Cuba to the United\nStates and specifically \u201crelinquishe[d] all claim[s] of sover\u00ad\neignty . . . and title.\u201d See Treaty of Paris, Dec. 10, 1898,\nU. S.-Spain, Art. I, 30 Stat. 1755, T. S. No. 343. From the\ndate the treaty with Spain was signed until the Cuban\nRepublic was established on May 20, 1902, the United\nStates governed the territory \u201cin trust\u201d for the benefit of\nthe Cuban people. Neely v. Henkel, 180 U. S. 109, 120\n(1901); H. Thomas, Cuba or The Pursuit of Freedom 436,\n460 (1998). And although it recognized, by entering into\nthe 1903 Lease Agreement, that Cuba retained \u201cultimate\nsovereignty\u201d over Guantanamo, the United States contin\u00ad\nued to maintain the same plenary control it had enjoyed\nsince 1898. Yet the Government\u2019s view is that the Consti\u00ad\ntution had no effect there, at least as to noncitizens, be\u00ad\ncause the United States disclaimed sovereignty in the\nformal sense of the term. The necessary implication of the\nargument is that by surrendering formal sovereignty over\nany unincorporated territory to a third party, while at the\nsame time entering into a lease that grants total control\nover the territory back to the United States, it would be\npossible for the political branches to govern without legal\nconstraint.\n   Our basic charter cannot be contracted away like this.\nThe Constitution grants Congress and the President the\npower to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the\npower to decide when and where its terms apply. Even\nwhen the United States acts outside its borders, its powers\nare not \u201cabsolute and unlimited\u201d but are subject \u201cto such\nrestrictions as are expressed in the Constitution.\u201d Murphy\nv. Ramsey, 114 U. S. 15, 44 (1885). Abstaining from ques\u00ad\ntions involving formal sovereignty and territorial govern\u00ad\nance is one thing. To hold the political branches have the\npower to switch the Constitution on or off at will is quite\nanother. The former position reflects this Court\u2019s recogni\u00ad\n36                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion that certain matters requiring political judgments are\nbest left to the political branches. The latter would permit\na striking anomaly in our tripartite system of government,\nleading to a regime in which Congress and the President,\nnot this Court, say \u201cwhat the law is.\u201d Marbury v. Madi-\nson, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).\n   These concerns have particular bearing upon the Sus\u00ad\npension Clause question in the cases now before us, for the\nwrit of habeas corpus is itself an indispensable mechanism\nfor monitoring the separation of powers. The test for\ndetermining the scope of this provision must not be subject\nto manipulation by those whose power it is designed to\nrestrain.\n                            C\n  As we recognized in Rasul, 542 U. S., at 476; id., at 487\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment), the outlines of a\nframework for determining the reach of the Suspension\nClause are suggested by the factors the Court relied upon\nin Eisentrager. In addition to the practical concerns dis\u00ad\ncussed above, the Eisentrager Court found relevant that\neach petitioner:\n     \u201c(a) is an enemy alien; (b) has never been or resided in\n     the United States; (c) was captured outside of our ter\u00ad\n     ritory and there held in military custody as a prisoner\n     of war; (d) was tried and convicted by a Military\n     Commission sitting outside the United States; (e) for\n     offenses against laws of war committed outside the\n     United States; (f) and is at all times imprisoned out\u00ad\n     side the United States.\u201d 339 U. S., at 777.\nBased on this language from Eisentrager, and the reason\u00ad\ning in our other extraterritoriality opinions, we conclude\nthat at least three factors are relevant in determining the\nreach of the Suspension Clause: (1) the citizenship and\nstatus of the detainee and the adequacy of the process\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           37\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough which that status determination was made; (2)\nthe nature of the sites where apprehension and then\ndetention took place; and (3) the practical obstacles inher\u00ad\nent in resolving the prisoner\u2019s entitlement to the writ.\n   Applying this framework, we note at the onset that the\nstatus of these detainees is a matter of dispute. The peti\u00ad\ntioners, like those in Eisentrager, are not American citi\u00ad\nzens. But the petitioners in Eisentrager did not contest, it\nseems, the Court\u2019s assertion that they were \u201cenemy\nalien[s].\u201d Ibid. In the instant cases, by contrast, the\ndetainees deny they are enemy combatants. They have\nbeen afforded some process in CSRT proceedings to de\u00ad\ntermine their status; but, unlike in Eisentrager, supra, at\n766, there has been no trial by military commission for\nviolations of the laws of war. The difference is not trivial.\nThe records from the Eisentrager trials suggest that, well\nbefore the petitioners brought their case to this Court,\nthere had been a rigorous adversarial process to test the\nlegality of their detention. The Eisentrager petitioners\nwere charged by a bill of particulars that made detailed\nfactual allegations against them. See 14 United Nations\nWar Crimes Commission, Law Reports of Trials of War\nCriminals 8\u201310 (1949) (reprint 1997). To rebut the accu\u00ad\nsations, they were entitled to representation by counsel,\nallowed to introduce evidence on their own behalf, and\npermitted to cross-examine the prosecution\u2019s witnesses.\nSee Memorandum by Command of Lt. Gen. Wedemeyer,\nJan. 21, 1946 (establishing \u201cRegulations Governing the\nTrial of War Criminals\u201d in the China Theater), in Tr. of\nRecord in Johnson v. Eisentrager, O. T. 1949, No. 306, pp.\n34\u201340.\n   In comparison the procedural protections afforded to the\ndetainees in the CSRT hearings are far more limited, and,\nwe conclude, fall well short of the procedures and adver\u00ad\nsarial mechanisms that would eliminate the need for\nhabeas corpus review. Although the detainee is assigned a\n38                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cPersonal Representative\u201d to assist him during CSRT\nproceedings, the Secretary of the Navy\u2019s memorandum\nmakes clear that person is not the detainee\u2019s lawyer or\neven his \u201cadvocate.\u201d See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\u2013\n1196, at 155, 172. The Government\u2019s evidence is accorded\na presumption of validity. Id., at 159. The detainee is\nallowed to present \u201creasonably available\u201d evidence, id., at\n155, but his ability to rebut the Government\u2019s evidence\nagainst him is limited by the circumstances of his con\u00ad\nfinement and his lack of counsel at this stage. And al\u00ad\nthough the detainee can seek review of his status deter\u00ad\nmination in the Court of Appeals, that review process\ncannot cure all defects in the earlier proceedings. See Part\nV, infra.\n   As to the second factor relevant to this analysis, the\ndetainees here are similarly situated to the Eisentrager\npetitioners in that the sites of their apprehension and\ndetention are technically outside the sovereign territory of\nthe United States. As noted earlier, this is a factor that\nweighs against finding they have rights under the Sus\u00ad\npension Clause. But there are critical differences between\nLandsberg Prison, circa 1950, and the United States Na\u00ad\nval Station at Guantanamo Bay in 2008. Unlike its pre\u00ad\nsent control over the naval station, the United States\u2019\ncontrol over the prison in Germany was neither absolute\nnor indefinite. Like all parts of occupied Germany, the\nprison was under the jurisdiction of the combined Allied\nForces. See Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany\nand the Assumption of Supreme Authority with Respect to\nGermany, June 5, 1945, U. S.-U. S. S. R.-U. K.-Fr., 60\nStat. 1649, T. I. A. S. No. 1520. The United States was\ntherefore answerable to its Allies for all activities occur\u00ad\nring there. Cf. Hirota v. MacArthur, 338 U. S. 197, 198\n(1948) (per curiam) (military tribunal set up by Gen.\nDouglas MacArthur, acting as \u201cthe agent of the Allied\nPowers,\u201d was not a \u201ctribunal of the United States\u201d). The\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)          39\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAllies had not planned a long-term occupation of Ger\u00ad\nmany, nor did they intend to displace all German institu\u00ad\ntions even during the period of occupation. See Agree\u00ad\nments Respecting Basic Principles for Merger of the Three\nWestern German Zones of Occupation, and Other Matters,\nApr. 8, 1949, U. S.-U. K.-Fr., Art. 1, 63 Stat. 2819,\nT. I. A. S. No. 2066 (establishing a governing framework\n\u201c[d]uring the period in which it is necessary that the occu\u00ad\npation continue\u201d and expressing the desire \u201cthat the Ger\u00ad\nman people shall enjoy self-government to the maximum\npossible degree consistent with such occupation\u201d). The\nCourt\u2019s holding in Eisentrager was thus consistent with\nthe Insular Cases, where it had held there was no need to\nextend full constitutional protections to territories the\nUnited States did not intend to govern indefinitely. Guan\u00ad\ntanamo Bay, on the other hand, is no transient possession.\nIn every practical sense Guantanamo is not abroad; it is\nwithin the constant jurisdiction of the United States. See\nRasul, 542 U. S., at 480; id., at 487 (KENNEDY, J., concur\u00ad\nring in judgment).\n   As to the third factor, we recognize, as the Court did in\nEisentrager, that there are costs to holding the Suspension\nClause applicable in a case of military detention abroad.\nHabeas corpus proceedings may require expenditure of\nfunds by the Government and may divert the attention of\nmilitary personnel from other pressing tasks. While we\nare sensitive to these concerns, we do not find them dispo\u00ad\nsitive. Compliance with any judicial process requires\nsome incremental expenditure of resources. Yet civilian\ncourts and the Armed Forces have functioned along side\neach other at various points in our history. See, e.g.,\nDuncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304 (1946); Ex parte\nMilligan, 4 Wall. 2 (1866). The Government presents no\ncredible arguments that the military mission at Guan\u00ad\ntanamo would be compromised if habeas corpus courts had\njurisdiction to hear the detainees\u2019 claims. And in light of\n40                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe plenary control the United States asserts over the\nbase, none are apparent to us.\n  The situation in Eisentrager was far different, given the\nhistorical context and nature of the military\u2019s mission in\npost-War Germany. When hostilities in the European\nTheater came to an end, the United States became respon\u00ad\nsible for an occupation zone encompassing over 57,000\nsquare miles with a population of 18 million. See Letter\nfrom President Truman to Secretary of State Byrnes,\n(Nov. 28, 1945), in 8 Documents on American Foreign\nRelations 257 (R. Dennett & R. Turner eds. 1948); Pollock,\nA Territorial Pattern for the Military Occupation of Ger\u00ad\nmany, 38 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 970, 975 (1944). In addition to\nsupervising massive reconstruction and aid efforts the\nAmerican forces stationed in Germany faced potential\nsecurity threats from a defeated enemy. In retrospect the\npost-War occupation may seem uneventful. But at the\ntime Eisentrager was decided, the Court was right to be\nconcerned about judicial interference with the military\u2019s\nefforts to contain \u201cenemy elements, guerrilla fighters, and\n\u2018were-wolves.\u2019 \u201d 339 U. S., at 784.\n  Similar threats are not apparent here; nor does the\nGovernment argue that they are. The United States\nNaval Station at Guantanamo Bay consists of 45 square\nmiles of land and water. The base has been used, at vari\u00ad\nous points, to house migrants and refugees temporarily.\nAt present, however, other than the detainees themselves,\nthe only long-term residents are American military per\u00ad\nsonnel, their families, and a small number of workers. See\nHistory of Guantanamo Bay online at https://www.cnic.\nnavy.mil/Guantanamo/AboutGTMO/gtmohistorygeneral/\ngtmohistgeneral. The detainees have been deemed ene\u00ad\nmies of the United States. At present, dangerous as they\nmay be if released, they are contained in a secure prison\nfacility located on an isolated and heavily fortified military\nbase.\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           41\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  There is no indication, furthermore, that adjudicating a\nhabeas corpus petition would cause friction with the host\ngovernment. No Cuban court has jurisdiction over Ameri\u00ad\ncan military personnel at Guantanamo or the enemy\ncombatants detained there. While obligated to abide by\nthe terms of the lease, the United States is, for all practi\u00ad\ncal purposes, answerable to no other sovereign for its acts\non the base. Were that not the case, or if the detention\nfacility were located in an active theater of war, argu\u00ad\nments that issuing the writ would be \u201cimpracticable or\nanomalous\u201d would have more weight. See Reid, 354 U. S.,\nat 74 (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Under the facts\npresented here, however, there are few practical barriers\nto the running of the writ. To the extent barriers arise,\nhabeas corpus procedures likely can be modified to ad\u00ad\ndress them. See Part VI\u2013B, infra.\n  It is true that before today the Court has never held\nthat noncitizens detained by our Government in territory\nover which another country maintains de jure sovereignty\nhave any rights under our Constitution. But the cases\nbefore us lack any precise historical parallel. They involve\nindividuals detained by executive order for the duration of\na conflict that, if measured from September 11, 2001, to\nthe present, is already among the longest wars in Ameri\u00ad\ncan history. See Oxford Companion to American Military\nHistory 849 (1999). The detainees, moreover, are held in a\nterritory that, while technically not part of the United\nStates, is under the complete and total control of our\nGovernment. Under these circumstances the lack of a\nprecedent on point is no barrier to our holding.\n  We hold that Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 2, of the Constitution has full\neffect at Guantanamo Bay. If the privilege of habeas\ncorpus is to be denied to the detainees now before us,\nCongress must act in accordance with the requirements of\nthe Suspension Clause. Cf. Hamdi, 542 U. S., at 564\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\u201c[I]ndefinite imprisonment on\n42                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nreasonable suspicion is not an available option of treat\u00ad\nment for those accused of aiding the enemy, absent a\nsuspension of the writ\u201d). This Court may not impose a de\nfacto suspension by abstaining from these controversies.\nSee Hamdan, 548 U. S., at 585, n. 16 (\u201c[A]bstention is not\nappropriate in cases . . . in which the legal challenge\n\u2018turn[s] on the status of the persons as to whom the mili\u00ad\ntary asserted its power\u2019 \u201d (quoting Schlesinger v. Council-\nman, 420 U. S. 738, 759 (1975))). The MCA does not\npurport to be a formal suspension of the writ; and the\nGovernment, in its submissions to us, has not argued that\nit is. Petitioners, therefore, are entitled to the privilege of\nhabeas corpus to challenge the legality of their detention.\n                               V\n  In light of this holding the question becomes whether\nthe statute stripping jurisdiction to issue the writ avoids\nthe Suspension Clause mandate because Congress has\nprovided adequate substitute procedures for habeas cor\u00ad\npus. The Government submits there has been compliance\nwith the Suspension Clause because the DTA review\nprocess in the Court of Appeals, see DTA \u00a71005(e), pro\u00ad\nvides an adequate substitute. Congress has granted that\ncourt jurisdiction to consider\n     \u201c(i) whether the status determination of the [CSRT]\n     . . . was consistent with the standards and procedures\n     specified by the Secretary of Defense . . . and (ii) to the\n     extent the Constitution and laws of the United States\n     are applicable, whether the use of such standards and\n     procedures to make the determination is consistent\n     with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u201d\n     \u00a71005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742.\n  The Court of Appeals, having decided that the writ does\nnot run to the detainees in any event, found it unneces\u00ad\nsary to consider whether an adequate substitute has been\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)          43\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovided. In the ordinary course we would remand to the\nCourt of Appeals to consider this question in the first\ninstance. See Youakim v. Miller, 425 U. S. 231, 234 (1976)\n(per curiam). It is well settled, however, that the Court\u2019s\npractice of declining to address issues left unresolved in\nearlier proceedings is not an inflexible rule. Ibid. Depar\u00ad\nture from the rule is appropriate in \u201cexceptional\u201d circum\u00ad\nstances. See Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services,\nInc., 543 U. S. 157, 169 (2004); Duignan v. United States,\n274 U. S. 195, 200 (1927).\n   The gravity of the separation-of-powers issues raised by\nthese cases and the fact that these detainees have been\ndenied meaningful access to a judicial forum for a period of\nyears render these cases exceptional. The parties before\nus have addressed the adequacy issue. While we would\nhave found it informative to consider the reasoning of the\nCourt of Appeals on this point, we must weigh that\nagainst the harms petitioners may endure from additional\ndelay. And, given there are few precedents addressing\nwhat features an adequate substitute for habeas corpus\nmust contain, in all likelihood a remand simply would\ndelay ultimate resolution of the issue by this Court.\n   We do have the benefit of the Court of Appeals\u2019 con\u00ad\nstruction of key provisions of the DTA. When we granted\ncertiorari in these cases, we noted \u201cit would be of material\nassistance to consult any decision\u201d in the parallel DTA\nreview proceedings pending in the Court of Appeals, spe\u00ad\ncifically any rulings in the matter of Bismullah v. Gates.\n551 U. S. ___ (2007). Although the Court of Appeals has\nyet to complete a DTA review proceeding, the three-judge\npanel in Bismullah has issued an interim order giving\nguidance as to what evidence can be made part of the\nrecord on review and what access the detainees can have\nto counsel and to classified information. See 501 F. 3d 178\n(CADC) (Bismullah I), reh\u2019g denied, 503 F. 3d 137 (CADC\n2007) (Bismullah II). In that matter the full court denied\n44                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Government\u2019s motion for rehearing en banc, see Bis-\nmullah v. Gates, 514 F. 3d 1291 (CADC 2008) (Bismullah\nIII). The order denying rehearing was accompanied by\nfive separate statements from members of the court, which\noffer differing views as to scope of the judicial review\nCongress intended these detainees to have. Ibid.\n   Under the circumstances we believe the costs of further\ndelay substantially outweigh any benefits of remanding to\nthe Court of Appeals to consider the issue it did not ad\u00ad\ndress in these cases.\n                             A\n  Our case law does not contain extensive discussion of\nstandards defining suspension of the writ or of circum\u00ad\nstances under which suspension has occurred. This sim\u00ad\nply confirms the care Congress has taken throughout our\nNation\u2019s history to preserve the writ and its function.\nIndeed, most of the major legislative enactments pertain\u00ad\ning to habeas corpus have acted not to contract the writ\u2019s\nprotection but to expand it or to hasten resolution of pris\u00ad\noners\u2019 claims. See, e.g., Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, ch. 28,\n\u00a71, 14 Stat. 385 (current version codified at 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72241 (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (extending the federal writ\nto state prisoners)); Cf. Harris v. Nelson, 394 U. S. 286,\n299\u2013300 (1969) (interpreting the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71651, to allow discovery in habeas corpus proceedings);\nPeyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54, 64\u201365 (1968) (interpreting\nthe then-existing version of \u00a72241 to allow petitioner to\nproceed with his habeas corpus action, even though he had\nnot yet begun to serve his sentence).\n  There are exceptions, of course. Title I of the Antiterror\u00ad\nism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),\n\u00a7106, 110 Stat. 1220, contains certain gatekeeping provi\u00ad\nsions that restrict a prisoner\u2019s ability to bring new and\nrepetitive claims in \u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas corpus\nactions. We upheld these provisions against a Suspension\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           45\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nClause challenge in Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 662\u2013\n664 (1996). The provisions at issue in Felker, however, did\nnot constitute a substantial departure from common-law\nhabeas procedures. The provisions, for the most part,\ncodified the longstanding abuse-of-the-writ doctrine. Id.,\nat 664; see also McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489\n(1991). AEDPA applies, moreover, to federal, postconvic\u00ad\ntion review after criminal proceedings in state court have\ntaken place. As of this point, cases discussing the imple\u00ad\nmentation of that statute give little helpful instruction\n(save perhaps by contrast) for the instant cases, where no\ntrial has been held.\n   The two leading cases addressing habeas substitutes,\nSwain v. Pressley, 430 U. S. 372 (1977), and United States\nv. Hayman, 342 U. S. 205 (1952), likewise provide little\nguidance here. The statutes at issue were attempts to\nstreamline habeas corpus relief, not to cut it back.\n   The statute discussed in Hayman was 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255.\nIt replaced traditional habeas corpus for federal prisoners\n(at least in the first instance) with a process that allowed\nthe prisoner to file a motion with the sentencing court on\nthe ground that his sentence was, inter alia, \u201c \u2018imposed in\nviolation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u2019 \u201d\n342 U. S., at 207, n. 1. The purpose and effect of the stat\u00ad\nute was not to restrict access to the writ but to make\npostconviction proceedings more efficient. It directed\nclaims not to the court that had territorial jurisdiction\nover the place of the petitioner\u2019s confinement but to the\nsentencing court, a court already familiar with the facts of\nthe case. As the Hayman Court explained\n    \u201cSection 2255 . . . was passed at the instance of the\n    Judicial Conference to meet practical difficulties that\n    had arisen in administering the habeas corpus juris\u00ad\n    diction of the federal courts. Nowhere in the history\n    of Section 2255 do we find any purpose to impinge\n46                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n     upon prisoners\u2019 rights of collateral attack upon their\n     convictions. On the contrary, the sole purpose was to\n     minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas cor\u00ad\n     pus hearings by affording the same rights in another\n     and more convenient forum.\u201d Id., at 219.\nSee also Hill v. United States, 368 U. S. 424, 427, 428, and\nn. 5 (1962) (noting that \u00a72255 provides a remedy in the\nsentencing court that is \u201cexactly commensurate\u201d with the\npre-existing federal habeas corpus remedy).\n   The statute in Swain, D. C. Code Ann. \u00a723\u2013110(g)\n(1973), applied to prisoners in custody under sentence of\nthe Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Before\nenactment of the District of Columbia Court Reform and\nCriminal Procedure Act of 1970 (D. C. Court Reform Act),\n84 Stat. 473, those prisoners could file habeas petitions in\nthe United States District Court for the District of Colum\u00ad\nbia. The Act, which was patterned on \u00a72255, substituted a\nnew collateral process in the Superior Court for the pre\u00ad\nexisting habeas corpus procedure in the District Court.\nSee Swain, 430 U. S., at 374\u2013378. But, again, the purpose\nand effect of the statute was to expedite consideration of\nthe prisoner\u2019s claims, not to delay or frustrate it. See id.,\nat 375, n. 4 (noting that the purpose of the D. C. Court\nReform Act was to \u201calleviate\u201d administrative burdens on\nthe District Court).\n   That the statutes in Hayman and Swain were designed\nto strengthen, rather than dilute, the writ\u2019s protections\nwas evident, furthermore, from this significant fact: Nei\u00ad\nther statute eliminated traditional habeas corpus relief.\nIn both cases the statute at issue had a saving clause,\nproviding that a writ of habeas corpus would be available\nif the alternative process proved inadequate or ineffective.\nSwain, supra, at 381; Hayman, supra, at 223. The Court\nplaced explicit reliance upon these provisions in upholding\nthe statutes against constitutional challenges. See Swain,\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           47\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsupra, at 381 (noting that the provision \u201cavoid[ed] any\nserious question about the constitutionality of the stat\u00ad\nute\u201d); Hayman, supra, at 223 (noting that, because habeas\nremained available as a last resort, it was unnecessary to\n\u201creach constitutional questions\u201d).\n   Unlike in Hayman and Swain, here we confront stat\u00ad\nutes, the DTA and the MCA, that were intended to cir\u00ad\ncumscribe habeas review. Congress\u2019 purpose is evident\nnot only from the unequivocal nature of MCA \u00a77\u2019s jurisdic\u00ad\ntion-stripping language, 28 U. S. C. A. \u00a72241(e)(1) (Supp.\n2007) (\u201cNo court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to\nhear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus\n. . .\u201d), but also from a comparison of the DTA to the stat\u00ad\nutes at issue in Hayman and Swain. When interpreting a\nstatute, we examine related provisions in other parts of\nthe U. S. Code. See, e.g., West Virginia Univ. Hospitals,\nInc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, 88\u201397 (1991); Babbitt v. Sweet\nHome Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687,\n717\u2013718 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); see generally W.\nEskridge, P. Frickey, & E. Garrett, Cases and Materials\non Legislation: Statutes and the Creation of Public Policy\n1039 (3d ed. 2001). When Congress has intended to re\u00ad\nplace traditional habeas corpus with habeas-like substi\u00ad\ntutes, as was the case in Hayman and Swain, it has\ngranted to the courts broad remedial powers to secure the\nhistoric office of the writ. In the \u00a72255 context, for exam\u00ad\nple, Congress has granted to the reviewing court power to\n\u201cdetermine the issues and make findings of fact and con\u00ad\nclusions of law\u201d with respect to whether \u201cthe judgment [of\nconviction] was rendered without jurisdiction, or . . . the\nsentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise\nopen to collateral attack.\u201d 28 U. S. C. A. \u00a72255(b) (Supp.\n2008). The D. C. Court Reform Act, the statute upheld in\nSwain, contained a similar provision. \u00a723\u2013110(g), 84 Stat.\n609.\n   In contrast the DTA\u2019s jurisdictional grant is quite lim\u00ad\n48                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nited. The Court of Appeals has jurisdiction not to inquire\ninto the legality of the detention generally but only to\nassess whether the CSRT complied with the \u201cstandards\nand procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense\u201d and\nwhether those standards and procedures are lawful. DTA\n\u00a71005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742. If Congress had envisioned\nDTA review as coextensive with traditional habeas corpus,\nit would not have drafted the statute in this manner.\nInstead, it would have used language similar to what it\nused in the statutes at issue in Hayman and Swain. Cf.\nRussello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)\n(\u201c \u2018[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\nexclusion\u2019 \u201d (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472\nF. 2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972))). Unlike in Hayman and\nSwain, moreover, there has been no effort to preserve\nhabeas corpus review as an avenue of last resort. No\nsaving clause exists in either the MCA or the DTA. And\nMCA \u00a77 eliminates habeas review for these petitioners.\n    The differences between the DTA and the habeas stat\u00ad\nute that would govern in MCA \u00a77\u2019s absence, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72241 (2000 ed. and Supp. V), are likewise telling. In\n\u00a72241 (2000 ed.) Congress confirmed the authority of \u201cany\njustice\u201d or \u201ccircuit judge\u201d to issue the writ. Cf. Felker, 518\nU. S., at 660\u2013661 (interpreting Title I of AEDPA to not\nstrip from this Court the power to entertain original ha\u00ad\nbeas corpus petitions). That statute accommodates the\nnecessity for factfinding that will arise in some cases by\nallowing the appellate judge or Justice to transfer the case\nto a district court of competent jurisdiction, whose institu\u00ad\ntional capacity for factfinding is superior to his or her own.\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a72241(b). By granting the Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 cases, see\nDTA \u00a71005(e)(2)(A), 119 Stat. 2742, Congress has fore\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           49\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclosed that option. This choice indicates Congress in\u00ad\ntended the Court of Appeals to have a more limited role in\nenemy combatant status determinations than a district\ncourt has in habeas corpus proceedings. The DTA should\nbe interpreted to accord some latitude to the Court of\nAppeals to fashion procedures necessary to make its re\u00ad\nview function a meaningful one, but, if congressional\nintent is to be respected, the procedures adopted cannot be\nas extensive or as protective of the rights of the detainees\nas they would be in a \u00a72241 proceeding. Otherwise there\nwould have been no, or very little, purpose for enacting the\nDTA.\n   To the extent any doubt remains about Congress\u2019 intent,\nthe legislative history confirms what the plain text\nstrongly suggests: In passing the DTA Congress did not\nintend to create a process that differs from traditional\nhabeas corpus process in name only. It intended to create\na more limited procedure. See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. S14263\n(Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Graham) (noting that\nthe DTA \u201cextinguish[es] these habeas and other actions in\norder to effect a transfer of jurisdiction over these cases to\nthe DC Circuit Court\u201d and agreeing that the bill \u201ccreate[s]\nin their place a very limited judicial review of certain\nmilitary administrative decisions\u201d); id., at S14268 (state\u00ad\nment of Sen. Kyl) (\u201cIt is important to note that the limited\njudicial review authorized by paragraphs 2 and 3 of sub\u00ad\nsection (e) [of DTA \u00a71005] are not habeas-corpus review.\nIt is a limited judicial review of its own nature\u201d).\n   It is against this background that we must interpret the\nDTA and assess its adequacy as a substitute for habeas\ncorpus. The present cases thus test the limits of the Sus\u00ad\npension Clause in ways that Hayman and Swain did not.\n                           B\n  We do not endeavor to offer a comprehensive summary\nof the requisites for an adequate substitute for habeas\n50                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncorpus. We do consider it uncontroversial, however, that\nthe privilege of habeas corpus entitles the prisoner to a\nmeaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being\nheld pursuant to \u201cthe erroneous application or interpreta\u00ad\ntion\u201d of relevant law. St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 302. And the\nhabeas court must have the power to order the conditional\nrelease of an individual unlawfully detained\u2014though\nrelease need not be the exclusive remedy and is not the\nappropriate one in every case in which the writ is granted.\nSee Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 136 (1807) (where\nimprisonment is unlawful, the court \u201ccan only direct [the\nprisoner] to be discharged\u201d); R. Hurd, Treatise on the\nRight of Personal Liberty, and On the Writ of Habeas\nCorpus and the Practice Connected with It: With a View of\nthe Law of Extradition of Fugitives 222 (2d ed. 1876) (\u201cIt\ncannot be denied where \u2018a probable ground is shown that\nthe party is imprisoned without just cause, and therefore,\nhath a right to be delivered,\u2019 for the writ then becomes a\n\u2018writ of right, which may not be denied but ought to be\ngranted to every man that is committed or detained in\nprison or otherwise restrained of his liberty\u2019 \u201d). But see\nChessman v. Teets, 354 U. S. 156, 165\u2013166 (1957) (re\u00ad\nmanding in a habeas case for retrial within a \u201creasonable\ntime\u201d). These are the easily identified attributes of any\nconstitutionally adequate habeas corpus proceeding.\nBut, depending on the circumstances, more may be\nrequired.\n   Indeed, common-law habeas corpus was, above all, an\nadaptable remedy. Its precise application and scope\nchanged depending upon the circumstances. See 3 Black-\nstone *131 (describing habeas as \u201cthe great and efficacious\nwrit, in all manner of illegal confinement\u201d); see also\nSchlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, 319 (1995) (Habeas \u201cis, at\nits core, an equitable remedy\u201d); Jones v. Cunningham, 371\nU. S. 236, 243 (1963) (Habeas is not \u201ca static, narrow,\nformalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its\n                  Cite as: 553 U.

It appears the common-law habeas\ncourt\u2019s role was most extensive in cases of pretrial and\nnoncriminal detention, where there had been little or no\nprevious judicial review of the cause for detention. Nota\u00ad\nbly, the black-letter rule that prisoners could not contro\u00ad\nvert facts in the jailer\u2019s return was not followed (or at least\nnot with consistency) in such cases. Hurd, supra, at 271\n(noting that the general rule was \u201csubject to exceptions\u201d\nincluding cases of bail and impressment); Oakes, Legal\nHistory in the High Court\u2014Habeas Corpus, 64 Mich. L.\nRev. 451, 457 (1966) (\u201c[W]hen a prisoner applied for ha\u00ad\nbeas corpus before indictment or trial, some courts exam\u00ad\nined the written depositions on which he had been ar\u00ad\nrested or committed, and others even heard oral testimony\nto determine whether the evidence was sufficient to justi\u00ad\nfying holding him for trial\u201d (footnotes omitted)); Fallon &\nMeltzer, Habeas Corpus Jurisdiction, Substantive Rights,\nand the War on Terror, 120 Harv.

Rev. 2029, 2102\n(2007) (\u201c[T]he early practice was not consistent: courts\noccasionally permitted factual inquiries when no other\nopportunity for judicial review existed\u201d).\n  There is evidence from 19th-century American sources\nindicating that, even in States that accorded strong res\njudicata effect to prior adjudications, habeas courts in this\ncountry routinely allowed prisoners to introduce exculpa\u00ad\ntory evidence that was either unknown or previously\nunavailable to the prisoner. See, e.g., Ex parte Pattison,\n56 Miss. 161, 164 (1878) (noting that \u201c[w]hile the former\nadjudication must be considered as conclusive on the\ntestimony then adduced\u201d \u201cnewly developed exculpatory\nevidence . . . may authorize the admission to bail\u201d); Ex\nparte Foster, 5 Tex.

Church, Treatise on the Writ of Habeas\nCorpus \u00a7182, p. 235 1886) (hereinafter Church) (noting\nthat habeas courts would \u201chear evidence anew if justice\nrequire it\u201d). Justice McLean, on Circuit in 1855, expressed\nhis view that a habeas court should consider a prior judg\u00ad\nment conclusive \u201cwhere there was clearly jurisdiction and\na full and fair hearing; but that it might not be so consid\u00ad\nered when any of these requisites were wanting.\u201d Ex parte\nRobinson, 20 F. Cas. 969, 971, (No. 11,935) (CC Ohio\n1855). To illustrate the circumstances in which the prior\nadjudication did not bind the habeas court, he gave the\nexample of a case in which \u201c[s]everal unimpeached wit\u00ad\nnesses\u201d provided new evidence to exculpate the prisoner.\nIbid.\n   The idea that the necessary scope of habeas review in\npart depends upon the rigor of any earlier proceedings\naccords with our test for procedural adequacy in the due\nprocess context. See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319,\n335 (1976) (noting that the Due Process Clause requires\nan assessment of, inter alia, \u201cthe risk of an erroneous\ndeprivation of [a liberty interest;] and the probable value,\nif any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards\u201d).\nThis principle has an established foundation in habeas\ncorpus jurisprudence as well, as Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s\nopinion in Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193 (1830), demon\u00ad\nstrates. Like the petitioner in Swain, Watkins sought a\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)          53\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwrit of habeas corpus after being imprisoned pursuant to a\njudgment of a District of Columbia court. In holding that\nthe judgment stood on \u201chigh ground,\u201d 3 Pet., at 209, the\nChief Justice emphasized the character of the court that\nrendered the original judgment, noting it was a \u201ccourt of\nrecord, having general jurisdiction over criminal cases.\u201d\nId., at 203. In contrast to \u201cinferior\u201d tribunals of limited\njurisdiction, ibid., courts of record had broad remedial\npowers, which gave the habeas court greater confidence in\nthe judgment\u2019s validity. See generally Neuman, Habeas\nCorpus, Executive Detention, and the Removal of Aliens,\n98 Colum. L. Rev. 961, 982\u2013983 (1998).\n   Accordingly, where relief is sought from a sentence that\nresulted from the judgment of a court of record, as was the\ncase in Watkins and indeed in most federal habeas cases,\nconsiderable deference is owed to the court that ordered\nconfinement. See Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 506\n(1953) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.) (noting that a federal\nhabeas court should accept a state court\u2019s factual findings\nunless \u201ca vital flaw be found in the process of ascertaining\nsuch facts in the State court\u201d). Likewise in those cases the\nprisoner should exhaust adequate alternative remedies\nbefore filing for the writ in federal court. See Ex parte\nRoyall, 117 U. S. 241, 251\u2013252 (1886) (requiring exhaus\u00ad\ntion of state collateral processes). Both aspects of federal\nhabeas corpus review are justified because it can be as\u00ad\nsumed that, in the usual course, a court of record provides\ndefendants with a fair, adversary proceeding. In cases\ninvolving state convictions this framework also respects\nfederalism; and in federal cases it has added justification\nbecause the prisoner already has had a chance to seek\nreview of his conviction in a federal forum through a direct\nappeal. The present cases fall outside these categories,\nhowever; for here the detention is by executive order.\n   Where a person is detained by executive order, rather\nthan, say, after being tried and convicted in a court, the\n54                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nneed for collateral review is most pressing. A criminal\nconviction in the usual course occurs after a judicial hear\u00ad\ning before a tribunal disinterested in the outcome and\ncommitted to procedures designed to ensure its own inde\u00ad\npendence. These dynamics are not inherent in executive\ndetention orders or executive review procedures. In this\ncontext the need for habeas corpus is more urgent. The\nintended duration of the detention and the reasons for it\nbear upon the precise scope of the inquiry. Habeas corpus\nproceedings need not resemble a criminal trial, even when\nthe detention is by executive order. But the writ must be\neffective. The habeas court must have sufficient authority\nto conduct a meaningful review of both the cause for de\u00ad\ntention and the Executive\u2019s power to detain.\n   To determine the necessary scope of habeas corpus\nreview, therefore, we must assess the CSRT process, the\nmechanism through which petitioners\u2019 designation as\nenemy combatants became final. Whether one character\u00ad\nizes the CSRT process as direct review of the Executive\u2019s\nbattlefield determination that the detainee is an enemy\ncombatant\u2014as the parties have and as we do\u2014or as the\nfirst step in the collateral review of a battlefield determi\u00ad\nnation makes no difference in a proper analysis of whether\nthe procedures Congress put in place are an adequate\nsubstitute for habeas corpus. What matters is the sum\ntotal of procedural protections afforded to the detainee at\nall stages, direct and collateral.\n   Petitioners identify what they see as myriad deficiencies\nin the CSRTs. The most relevant for our purposes are the\nconstraints upon the detainee\u2019s ability to rebut the factual\nbasis for the Government\u2019s assertion that he is an enemy\ncombatant. As already noted, see Part IV\u2013C, supra, at the\nCSRT stage the detainee has limited means to find or\npresent evidence to challenge the Government\u2019s case\nagainst him. He does not have the assistance of counsel\nand may not be aware of the most critical allegations that\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           55\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Government relied upon to order his detention. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\u20131196, at 156, \u00b6F(8) (noting\nthat the detainee can access only the \u201cunclassified portion\nof the Government Information\u201d). The detainee can con\u00ad\nfront witnesses that testify during the CSRT proceedings.\nId., at 144, \u00b6g(8). But given that there are in effect no\nlimits on the admission of hearsay evidence\u2014the only\nrequirement is that the tribunal deem the evidence \u201crele\u00ad\nvant and helpful,\u201d ibid., \u00b6g(9)\u2014the detainee\u2019s opportunity\nto question witnesses is likely to be more theoretical than\nreal.\n   The Government defends the CSRT process, arguing\nthat it was designed to conform to the procedures sug\u00ad\ngested by the plurality in Hamdi. See 542 U. S., at 538.\nSetting aside the fact that the relevant language in Hamdi\ndid not garner a majority of the Court, it does not control\nthe matter at hand. None of the parties in Hamdi argued\nthere had been a suspension of the writ. Nor could they.\nThe \u00a72241 habeas corpus process remained in place, id., at\n525. Accordingly, the plurality concentrated on whether\nthe Executive had the authority to detain and, if so, what\nrights the detainee had under the Due Process Clause.\nTrue, there are places in the Hamdi plurality opinion\nwhere it is difficult to tell where its extrapolation of \u00a72241\nends and its analysis of the petitioner\u2019s Due Process rights\nbegins. But the Court had no occasion to define the neces\u00ad\nsary scope of habeas review, for Suspension Clause pur\u00ad\nposes, in the context of enemy combatant detentions. The\nclosest the plurality came to doing so was in discussing\nwhether, in light of separation-of-powers concerns, \u00a72241\nshould be construed to forbid the District Court from\ninquiring beyond the affidavit Hamdi\u2019s custodian provided\nin answer to the detainee\u2019s habeas petition. The plurality\nanswered this question with an emphatic \u201cno.\u201d Id., at 527\n(labeling this argument as \u201cextreme\u201d); id., at 535\u2013536.\n   Even if we were to assume that the CSRTs satisfy due\n56                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprocess standards, it would not end our inquiry. Habeas\ncorpus is a collateral process that exists, in Justice\nHolmes\u2019 words, to \u201ccu[t] through all forms and g[o] to the\nvery tissue of the structure. It comes in from the outside,\nnot in subordination to the proceedings, and although\nevery form may have been preserved opens the inquiry\nwhether they have been more than an empty shell.\u201d\nFrank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309, 346 (1915) (dissenting\nopinion). Even when the procedures authorizing detention\nare structurally sound, the Suspension Clause remains\napplicable and the writ relevant. See 2 Chambers, Course\nof Lectures on English Law 1767\u20131773, at 6 (\u201cLiberty may\nbe violated either by arbitrary imprisonment without law\nor the appearance of law, or by a lawful magistrate for an\nunlawful reason\u201d). This is so, as Hayman and Swain\nmake clear, even where the prisoner is detained after a\ncriminal trial conducted in full accordance with the protec\u00ad\ntions of the Bill of Rights. Were this not the case, there\nwould have been no reason for the Court to inquire into\nthe adequacy of substitute habeas procedures in Hayman\nand Swain. That the prisoners were detained pursuant to\nthe most rigorous proceedings imaginable, a full criminal\ntrial, would have been enough to render any habeas sub\u00ad\nstitute acceptable per se.\n   Although we make no judgment as to whether the\nCSRTs, as currently constituted, satisfy due process stan\u00ad\ndards, we agree with petitioners that, even when all the\nparties involved in this process act with diligence and in\ngood faith, there is considerable risk of error in the tribu\u00ad\nnal\u2019s findings of fact. This is a risk inherent in any proc\u00ad\ness that, in the words of the former Chief Judge of the\nCourt of Appeals, is \u201cclosed and accusatorial.\u201d See Bis-\nmullah III, 514 F. 3d, at 1296 (Ginsburg, C. J., concurring\nin denial of rehearing en banc). And given that the conse\u00ad\nquence of error may be detention of persons for the dura\u00ad\ntion of hostilities that may last a generation or more, this\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           57\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nis a risk too significant to ignore.\n   For the writ of habeas corpus, or its substitute, to func\u00ad\ntion as an effective and proper remedy in this context, the\ncourt that conducts the habeas proceeding must have the\nmeans to correct errors that occurred during the CSRT\nproceedings. This includes some authority to assess the\nsufficiency of the Government\u2019s evidence against the\ndetainee. It also must have the authority to admit and\nconsider relevant exculpatory evidence that was not intro\u00ad\nduced during the earlier proceeding. Federal habeas\npetitioners long have had the means to supplement the\nrecord on review, even in the postconviction habeas set\u00ad\nting. See Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313 (1963),\noverruled in part by Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1,\n5 (1992).      Here that opportunity is constitutionally\nrequired.\n   Consistent with the historic function and province of the\nwrit, habeas corpus review may be more circumscribed if\nthe underlying detention proceedings are more thorough\nthan they were here. In two habeas cases involving enemy\naliens tried for war crimes, In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1\n(1946), and Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), for exam\u00ad\nple, this Court limited its review to determining whether\nthe Executive had legal authority to try the petitioners by\nmilitary commission. See Yamashita, supra, at 8 (\u201c[O]n\napplication for habeas corpus we are not concerned with\nthe guilt or innocence of the petitioners. We consider here\nonly the lawful power of the commission to try the peti\u00ad\ntioner for the offense charged\u201d); Quirin, supra, at 25 (\u201cWe\nare not here concerned with any question of the guilt or\ninnocence of petitioners\u201d). Military courts are not courts of\nrecord. See Watkins, 3 Pet., at 209; Church 513. And the\nprocedures used to try General Yamashita have been\nsharply criticized by Members of this Court. See Hamdan,\n548 U. S., at 617; Yamashita, supra, at 41\u201381 (Rutledge,\nJ., dissenting). We need not revisit these cases, however.\n58                   BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nFor on their own terms, the proceedings in Yamashita and\nQuirin, like those in Eisentrager, had an adversarial\nstructure that is lacking here. See Yamashita, supra, at 5\n(noting that General Yamashita was represented by six\nmilitary lawyers and that \u201c[t]hroughout the proceedings\n. . . defense counsel . . . demonstrated their professional\nskill and resourcefulness and their proper zeal for the\ndefense with which they were charged\u201d); Quirin, supra, at\n23\u201324; Exec. Order No. 9185, 7 Fed. Reg. 5103 (1942)\n(appointing counsel to represent the German saboteurs).\n    The extent of the showing required of the Government\nin these cases is a matter to be determined. We need not\nexplore it further at this stage. We do hold that when the\njudicial power to issue habeas corpus properly is invoked\nthe judicial officer must have adequate authority to make\na determination in light of the relevant law and facts and\nto formulate and issue appropriate orders for relief, in\u00ad\ncluding, if necessary, an order directing the prisoner\u2019s\nrelease.\n                                C\n  We now consider whether the DTA allows the Court of\nAppeals to conduct a proceeding meeting these standards.\n\u201c[W]e are obligated to construe the statute to avoid [con\u00ad\nstitutional] problems\u201d if it is \u201c \u2018fairly possible\u2019 \u201d to do so. St.\nCyr, 533 U. S., at 299\u2013300 (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285\nU. S. 22, 62 (1932)). There are limits to this principle,\nhowever. The canon of constitutional avoidance does not\nsupplant traditional modes of statutory interpretation.\nSee Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 385 (2005) (\u201cThe\ncanon of constitutional avoidance comes into play only\nwhen, after the application of ordinary textual analysis,\nthe statute is found to be susceptible of more than one\nconstruction; and the canon functions as a means of choos-\ning between them\u201d). We cannot ignore the text and pur\u00ad\npose of a statute in order to save it.\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           59\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The DTA does not explicitly empower the Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals to order the applicant in a DTA review proceeding\nreleased should the court find that the standards and\nprocedures used at his CSRT hearing were insufficient to\njustify detention. This is troubling. Yet, for present pur\u00ad\nposes, we can assume congressional silence permits a\nconstitutionally required remedy. In that case it would be\npossible to hold that a remedy of release is impliedly\nprovided for. The DTA might be read, furthermore, to\nallow the petitioners to assert most, if not all, of the legal\nclaims they seek to advance, including their most basic\nclaim: that the President has no authority under the\nAUMF to detain them indefinitely. (Whether the Presi\u00ad\ndent has such authority turns on whether the AUMF\nauthorizes\u2014and the Constitution permits\u2014the indefinite\ndetention of \u201cenemy combatants\u201d as the Department of\nDefense defines that term. Thus a challenge to the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s authority to detain is, in essence, a challenge to the\nDepartment\u2019s definition of enemy combatant, a \u201cstandard\u201d\nused by the CSRTs in petitioners\u2019 cases.) At oral argu\u00ad\nment, the Solicitor General urged us to adopt both these\nconstructions, if doing so would allow MCA \u00a77 to remain\nintact. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37, 53.\n  The absence of a release remedy and specific language\nallowing AUMF challenges are not the only constitutional\ninfirmities from which the statute potentially suffers,\nhowever. The more difficult question is whether the DTA\npermits the Court of Appeals to make requisite findings of\nfact. The DTA enables petitioners to request \u201creview\u201d of\ntheir CSRT determination in the Court of Appeals, DTA\n\u00a71005(e)(2)(B)(i), 119 Stat. 2742; but the \u201cScope of Review\u201d\nprovision confines the Court of Appeals\u2019 role to reviewing\nwhether the CSRT followed the \u201cstandards and proce\u00ad\ndures\u201d issued by the Department of Defense and assessing\nwhether those \u201cstandards and procedures\u201d are lawful.\n\u00a71005(e)(C), ibid. Among these standards is \u201cthe require\u00ad\n60                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment that the conclusion of the Tribunal be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence . . . allowing a rebuttable\npresumption in favor of the Government\u2019s evidence.\u201d\n\u00a71005(e)(C)(i), ibid.\n    Assuming the DTA can be construed to allow the Court\nof Appeals to review or correct the CSRT\u2019s factual deter\u00ad\nminations, as opposed to merely certifying that the tribu\u00ad\nnal applied the correct standard of proof, we see no way to\nconstrue the statute to allow what is also constitutionally\nrequired in this context: an opportunity for the detainee to\npresent relevant exculpatory evidence that was not made\npart of the record in the earlier proceedings.\n    On its face the statute allows the Court of Appeals to\nconsider no evidence outside the CSRT record. In the\nparallel litigation, however, the Court of Appeals deter\u00ad\nmined that the DTA allows it to order the production of all\n\u201c \u2018reasonably available information in the possession of the\nU. S. Government bearing on the issue of whether the\ndetainee meets the criteria to be designated as an enemy\ncombatant,\u2019 \u201d regardless of whether this evidence was put\nbefore the CSRT. See Bismullah I, 501 F. 3d, at 180. The\nGovernment, see Pet. for Cert. pending in Gates v. Bismul-\nlah, No. 07\u20131054 (hereinafter Bismullah Pet.), with sup\u00ad\nport from five members of the Court of Appeals, see Bis-\nmullah III, 514 F. 3d, at 1299 (Henderson, J., dissenting\nfrom denial of rehearing en banc); id., at 1302 (opinion of\nRandolph, J.) (same); id., at 1306 (opinion of Brown, J.)\n(same), disagrees with this interpretation. For present\npurposes, however, we can assume that the Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals was correct that the DTA allows introduction and\nconsideration of relevant exculpatory evidence that was\n\u201creasonably available\u201d to the Government at the time of\nthe CSRT but not made part of the record. Even so, the\nDTA review proceeding falls short of being a constitution\u00ad\nally adequate substitute, for the detainee still would have\nno opportunity to present evidence discovered after the\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)          61\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCSRT proceedings concluded.\n   Under the DTA the Court of Appeals has the power to\nreview CSRT determinations by assessing the legality of\nstandards and procedures. This implies the power to\ninquire into what happened at the CSRT hearing and,\nperhaps, to remedy certain deficiencies in that proceeding.\nBut should the Court of Appeals determine that the CSRT\nfollowed appropriate and lawful standards and proce\u00ad\ndures, it will have reached the limits of its jurisdiction.\nThere is no language in the DTA that can be construed to\nallow the Court of Appeals to admit and consider newly\ndiscovered evidence that could not have been made part of\nthe CSRT record because it was unavailable to either the\nGovernment or the detainee when the CSRT made its\nfindings. This evidence, however, may be critical to the\ndetainee\u2019s argument that he is not an enemy combatant\nand there is no cause to detain him.\n   This is not a remote hypothetical. One of the petition\u00ad\ners, Mohamed Nechla, requested at his CSRT hearing that\nthe Government contact his employer. The petitioner\nclaimed the employer would corroborate Nechla\u2019s conten\u00ad\ntion he had no affiliation with al Qaeda. Although the\nCSRT determined this testimony would be relevant, it also\nfound the witness was not reasonably available to testify\nat the time of the hearing. Petitioner\u2019s counsel, however,\nnow represents the witness is available to be heard. See\nBrief for Boumediene Petitioners 5. If a detainee can\npresent reasonably available evidence demonstrating\nthere is no basis for his continued detention, he must have\nthe opportunity to present this evidence to a habeas cor\u00ad\npus court. Even under the Court of Appeals\u2019 generous\nconstruction of the DTA, however, the evidence identified\nby Nechla would be inadmissible in a DTA review proceed\u00ad\ning. The role of an Article III court in the exercise of its\nhabeas corpus function cannot be circumscribed in this\nmanner.\n62                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  By foreclosing consideration of evidence not presented or\nreasonably available to the detainee at the CSRT proceed\u00ad\nings, the DTA disadvantages the detainee by limiting the\nscope of collateral review to a record that may not be\naccurate or complete. In other contexts, e.g., in post-trial\nhabeas cases where the prisoner already has had a full\nand fair opportunity to develop the factual predicate of his\nclaims, similar limitations on the scope of habeas review\nmay be appropriate. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.\n420, 436\u2013437 (2000) (noting that \u00a72254 \u201cdoes not equate\nprisoners who exercise diligence in pursuing their claims\nwith those who do not\u201d). In this context, however, where\nthe underlying detention proceedings lack the necessary\nadversarial character, the detainee cannot be held respon\u00ad\nsible for all deficiencies in the record.\n  The Government does not make the alternative argu\u00ad\nment that the DTA allows for the introduction of previ\u00ad\nously unavailable exculpatory evidence on appeal. It does\npoint out, however, that if a detainee obtains such evi\u00ad\ndence, he can request that the Deputy Secretary of De\u00ad\nfense convene a new CSRT. See Supp. Brief for Respon\u00ad\ndents 4. Whatever the merits of this procedure, it is an\ninsufficient replacement for the factual review these de\u00ad\ntainees are entitled to receive through habeas corpus. The\nDeputy Secretary\u2019s determination whether to initiate new\nproceedings is wholly a discretionary one. See Dept. of\nDefense, Office for the Administrative Review of the De\u00ad\ntention of Enemy Combatants, Instruction 5421.1, Proce\u00ad\ndure for Review of \u201cNew Evidence\u201d Relating to Enemy\nCombatant (EC) Status \u00b65(d) (May 7, 2007) (Instruction\n5421.1) (\u201cThe decision to convene a CSRT to reconsider the\nbasis of the detainee\u2019s [enemy combatant] status in light of\n\u2018new evidence\u2019 is a matter vested in the unreviewable\ndiscretion of the [Deputy Secretary of Defense]\u201d). And we\nsee no way to construe the DTA to allow a detainee to\nchallenge the Deputy Secretary\u2019s decision not to open a\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

Congress\ndirected the Secretary of Defense to devise procedures for\nconsidering new evidence, see DTA \u00a71005(a)(3), but the\ndetainee has no mechanism for ensuring that those proce\u00ad\ndures are followed. DTA \u00a71005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742,\nmakes clear that the Court of Appeals\u2019 jurisdiction is\n\u201climited to consideration of . . . whether the status deter\u00ad\nmination of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal with\nregard to such alien was consistent with the standards\nand procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense . . .\nand . . . whether the use of such standards and procedures\nto make the determination is consistent with the Constitu\u00ad\ntion and laws of the United States.\u201d DTA \u00a71005(e)(2)(A),\nibid., further narrows the Court of Appeals\u2019 jurisdiction to\nreviewing \u201cany final decision of a Combatant Status Re\u00ad\nview Tribunal that an alien is properly detained as an\nenemy combatant.\u201d The Deputy Secretary\u2019s determination\nwhether to convene a new CSRT is not a \u201cstatus determi\u00ad\nnation of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal,\u201d much\nless a \u201cfinal decision\u201d of that body.\n   We do not imply DTA review would be a constitutionally\nsufficient replacement for habeas corpus but for these\nlimitations on the detainee\u2019s ability to present exculpatory\nevidence. For even if it were possible, as a textual matter,\nto read into the statute each of the necessary procedures\nwe have identified, we could not overlook the cumulative\neffect of our doing so. To hold that the detainees at Guan\u00ad\ntanamo may, under the DTA, challenge the President\u2019s\nlegal authority to detain them, contest the CSRT\u2019s find\u00ad\nings of fact, supplement the record on review with excul\u00ad\npatory evidence, and request an order of release would\ncome close to reinstating the \u00a72241 habeas corpus process\nCongress sought to deny them. The language of the stat\u00ad\nute, read in light of Congress\u2019 reasons for enacting it,\ncannot bear this interpretation. Petitioners have met\ntheir burden of establishing that the DTA review process\n64                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nis, on its face, an inadequate substitute for habeas corpus.\n   Although we do not hold that an adequate substitute\nmust duplicate \u00a72241 in all respects, it suffices that the\nGovernment has not established that the detainees\u2019 access\nto the statutory review provisions at issue is an adequate\nsubstitute for the writ of habeas corpus. MCA \u00a77 thus\neffects an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. In view\nof our holding we need not discuss the reach of the writ\nwith respect to claims of unlawful conditions of treatment\nor confinement.\n                             VI \n\n                             A\n\n  In light of our conclusion that there is no jurisdictional\nbar to the District Court\u2019s entertaining petitioners\u2019 claims\nthe question remains whether there are prudential barri\u00ad\ners to habeas corpus review under these circumstances.\n  The Government argues petitioners must seek review of\ntheir CSRT determinations in the Court of Appeals before\nthey can proceed with their habeas corpus actions in the\nDistrict Court. As noted earlier, in other contexts and for\nprudential reasons this Court has required exhaustion of\nalternative remedies before a prisoner can seek federal\nhabeas relief. Most of these cases were brought by prison\u00ad\ners in state custody, e.g., Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241,\nand thus involved federalism concerns that are not rele\u00ad\nvant here. But we have extended this rule to require\ndefendants in courts-martial to exhaust their military\nappeals before proceeding with a federal habeas corpus\naction. See Schlesinger, 420 U. S., at 758.\n  The real risks, the real threats, of terrorist attacks are\nconstant and not likely soon to abate. The ways to disrupt\nour life and laws are so many and unforeseen that the\nCourt should not attempt even some general catalogue of\ncrises that might occur. Certain principles are apparent,\nhowever. Practical considerations and exigent circum\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            65\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstances inform the definition and reach of the law\u2019s writs,\nincluding habeas corpus. The cases and our tradition\nreflect this precept.\n   In cases involving foreign citizens detained abroad by\nthe Executive, it likely would be both an impractical and\nunprecedented extension of judicial power to assume that\nhabeas corpus would be available at the moment the\nprisoner is taken into custody. If and when habeas corpus\njurisdiction applies, as it does in these cases, then proper\ndeference can be accorded to reasonable procedures for\nscreening and initial detention under lawful and proper\nconditions of confinement and treatment for a reasonable\nperiod of time. Domestic exigencies, furthermore, might\nalso impose such onerous burdens on the Government that\nhere, too, the Judicial Branch would be required to devise\nsensible rules for staying habeas corpus proceedings until\nthe Government can comply with its requirements in a\nresponsible way. Cf. Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall., at 127\n(\u201cIf, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually\nclosed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice\naccording to law, then, on the theatre of active military\noperations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity\nto furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus over\u00ad\nthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and\nas no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern\nby martial rule until the laws can have their free course\u201d).\nHere, as is true with detainees apprehended abroad, a\nrelevant consideration in determining the courts\u2019 role is\nwhether there are suitable alternative processes in place\nto protect against the arbitrary exercise of governmental\npower.\n   The cases before us, however, do not involve detainees\nwho have been held for a short period of time while await\u00ad\ning their CSRT determinations. Were that the case, or\nwere it probable that the Court of Appeals could complete\na prompt review of their applications, the case for requir\u00ad\n66                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning temporary abstention or exhaustion of alternative\nremedies would be much stronger. These qualifications no\nlonger pertain here. In some of these cases six years have\nelapsed without the judicial oversight that habeas corpus\nor an adequate substitute demands. And there has been\nno showing that the Executive faces such onerous burdens\nthat it cannot respond to habeas corpus actions. To re\u00ad\nquire these detainees to complete DTA review before\nproceeding with their habeas corpus actions would be to\nrequire additional months, if not years, of delay. The first\nDTA review applications were filed over a year ago, but no\ndecisions on the merits have been issued. While some\ndelay in fashioning new procedures is unavoidable, the\ncosts of delay can no longer be borne by those who are held\nin custody. The detainees in these cases are entitled to a\nprompt habeas corpus hearing.\n  Our decision today holds only that the petitioners before\nus are entitled to seek the writ; that the DTA review\nprocedures are an inadequate substitute for habeas cor\u00ad\npus; and that the petitioners in these cases need not ex\u00ad\nhaust the review procedures in the Court of Appeals before\nproceeding with their habeas actions in the District Court.\nThe only law we identify as unconstitutional is MCA \u00a77,\n28 U. S. C. A. \u00a72241(e) (Supp. 2007). Accordingly, both the\nDTA and the CSRT process remain intact. Our holding\nwith regard to exhaustion should not be read to imply that\na habeas court should intervene the moment an enemy\ncombatant steps foot in a territory where the writ runs.\nThe Executive is entitled to a reasonable period of time to\ndetermine a detainee\u2019s status before a court entertains\nthat detainee\u2019s habeas corpus petition. The CSRT process\nis the mechanism Congress and the President set up to\ndeal with these issues. Except in cases of undue delay,\nfederal courts should refrain from entertaining an enemy\ncombatant\u2019s habeas corpus petition at least until after the\nDepartment, acting via the CSRT, has had a chance to\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

Felker,\nSwain, and Hayman stand for the proposition that the\nSuspension Clause does not resist innovation in the field\nof habeas corpus. Certain accommodations can be made to\nreduce the burden habeas corpus proceedings will place on\nthe military without impermissibly diluting the protec\u00ad\ntions of the writ.\n   In the DTA Congress sought to consolidate review of\npetitioners\u2019 claims in the Court of Appeals. Channeling\nfuture cases to one district court would no doubt reduce\nadministrative burdens on the Government. This is a\nlegitimate objective that might be advanced even without\nan amendment to \u00a72241. If, in a future case, a detainee\nfiles a habeas petition in another judicial district in which\na proper respondent can be served, see Rumsfeld v.\nPadilla, 542 U. S. 426, 435\u2013436 (2004), the Government\ncan move for change of venue to the court that will hear\nthese petitioners\u2019 cases, the United States District Court\nfor the District of Columbia. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71404(a);\nBraden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S.\n484, 499, n. 15 (1973).\n   Another of Congress\u2019 reasons for vesting exclusive juris\u00ad\ndiction in the Court of Appeals, perhaps, was to avoid the\nwidespread dissemination of classified information. The\nGovernment has raised similar concerns here and else\u00ad\nwhere. See Brief for Respondents 55\u201356; Bismullah Pet.\n30. We make no attempt to anticipate all of the eviden\u00ad\ntiary and access-to-counsel issues that will arise during\nthe course of the detainees\u2019 habeas corpus proceedings.\nWe recognize, however, that the Government has a legiti\u00ad\n68                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmate interest in protecting sources and methods of intelli\u00ad\ngence gathering; and we expect that the District Court will\nuse its discretion to accommodate this interest to the\ngreatest extent possible. Cf. United States v. Reynolds,\n345 U. S. 1, 10 (1953) (recognizing an evidentiary privilege\nin a civil damages case where \u201cthere is a reasonable dan\u00ad\nger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military\nmatters which, in the interest of national security, should\nnot be divulged\u201d).\n  These and the other remaining questions are within the\nexpertise and competence of the District Court to address\nin the first instance.\n                       *      *   *\n  In considering both the procedural and substantive\nstandards used to impose detention to prevent acts of\nterrorism, proper deference must be accorded to the politi\u00ad\ncal branches. See United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export\nCorp., 299 U. S. 304, 320 (1936). Unlike the President and\nsome designated Members of Congress, neither the Mem\u00ad\nbers of this Court nor most federal judges begin the day\nwith briefings that may describe new and serious threats\nto our Nation and its people. The law must accord the\nExecutive substantial authority to apprehend and detain\nthose who pose a real danger to our security.\n  Officials charged with daily operational responsibility\nfor our security may consider a judicial discourse on the\nhistory of the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679 and like matters\nto be far removed from the Nation\u2019s present, urgent con\u00ad\ncerns. Established legal doctrine, however, must be con\u00ad\nsulted for its teaching. Remote in time it may be; irrele\u00ad\nvant to the present it is not. Security depends upon a\nsophisticated intelligence apparatus and the ability of our\nArmed Forces to act and to interdict. There are further\nconsiderations, however. Security subsists, too, in fidelity\nto freedom\u2019s first principles. Chief among these are free\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

It is from these principles that the judicial\nauthority to consider petitions for habeas corpus relief\nderives.\n   Our opinion does not undermine the Executive\u2019s powers\nas Commander in Chief. On the contrary, the exercise of\nthose powers is vindicated, not eroded, when confirmed by\nthe Judicial Branch. Within the Constitution\u2019s separa\u00ad\ntion-of-powers structure, few exercises of judicial power\nare as legitimate or as necessary as the responsibility to\nhear challenges to the authority of the Executive to im\u00ad\nprison a person. Some of these petitioners have been in\ncustody for six years with no definitive judicial determina\u00ad\ntion as to the legality of their detention. Their access to\nthe writ is a necessity to determine the lawfulness of their\nstatus, even if, in the end, they do not obtain the relief\nthey seek.\n   Because our Nation\u2019s past military conflicts have been of\nlimited duration, it has been possible to leave the outer\nboundaries of war powers undefined. If, as some fear,\nterrorism continues to pose dangerous threats to us for\nyears to come, the Court might not have this luxury. This\nresult is not inevitable, however. The political branches,\nconsistent with their independent obligations to interpret\nand uphold the Constitution, can engage in a genuine\ndebate about how best to preserve constitutional values\nwhile protecting the Nation from terrorism. Cf. Hamdan,\n548 U. S., at 636 (BREYER, J., concurring) (\u201c[J]udicial\ninsistence upon that consultation does not weaken our\nNation\u2019s ability to deal with danger. To the contrary, that\ninsistence strengthens the Nation\u2019s ability to determine\u2014\nthrough democratic means\u2014how best to do so\u201d).\n   It bears repeating that our opinion does not address the\ncontent of the law that governs petitioners\u2019 detention.\nThat is a matter yet to be determined.

Bush, 542 U. S.\n466 (2004) held that statutory habeas jurisdiction ex-\ntended to claims of foreign nationals imprisoned by the\nUnited States at Guantanamo Bay, \u201cto determine the\nlegality of the Executive\u2019s potentially indefinite detention\u201d\nof them, id., at 485. Subsequent legislation eliminated the\nstatutory habeas jurisdiction over these claims, so that\nnow there must be constitutionally based jurisdiction or\nnone at all. JUSTICE SCALIA is thus correct that here, for\nthe first time, this Court holds there is (he says \u201cconfers\u201d)\nconstitutional habeas jurisdiction over aliens imprisoned\n2                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                    SOUTER, J., concurring\n\nby the military outside an area of de jure national sover-\neignty, see post, at 1 (dissenting opinion). But no one who\nreads the Court\u2019s opinion in Rasul could seriously doubt\nthat the jurisdictional question must be answered the\nsame way in purely constitutional cases, given the Court\u2019s\nreliance on the historical background of habeas generally\nin answering the statutory question. See, e.g., 542 U. S.,\nat 473, 481\u2013483, and nn. 11\u201314. Indeed, the Court in\nRasul directly answered the very historical question that\nJUSTICE SCALIA says is dispositive, see post, at 18; it wrote\nthat \u201c[a]pplication of the habeas statute to persons de-\ntained at [Guantanamo] is consistent with the historical\nreach of the writ of habeas corpus,\u201d 542 U. S., at 481.\nJUSTICE SCALIA dismisses the statement as dictum, see\npost, at 21, but if dictum it was, it was dictum well consid-\nered, and it stated the view of five Members of this Court\non the historical scope of the writ. Of course, it takes more\nthan a quotation from Rasul, however much on point, to\nresolve the constitutional issue before us here, which the\nmajority opinion has explored afresh in the detail it de-\nserves. But whether one agrees or disagrees with today\u2019s\ndecision, it is no bolt out of the blue.\n   A second fact insufficiently appreciated by the dissents\nis the length of the disputed imprisonments, some of the\nprisoners represented here today having been locked up\nfor six years, ante, at 66 (opinion of the Court). Hence the\nhollow ring when the dissenters suggest that the Court is\nsomehow precipitating the judiciary into reviewing claims\nthat the military (subject to appeal to the Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit) could handle within\nsome reasonable period of time. See, e.g., post, at 3 (opin-\nion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (\u201c[T]he Court should have declined\nto intervene until the D. C. Circuit had assessed the na-\nture and validity of the congressionally mandated proceed-\nings in a given detainee\u2019s case\u201d); post, at 6 (\u201c[I]t is not\nnecessary to consider the availability of the writ until the\n                  Cite as: 553 U.

These suggestions of judicial haste are all the more\nout of place given the Court\u2019s realistic acknowledgment\nthat in periods of exigency the tempo of any habeas review\nmust reflect the immediate peril facing the country. See\nante, at 64\u201365.\n   It is in fact the very lapse of four years from the time\nRasul put everyone on notice that habeas process was\navailable to Guantanamo prisoners, and the lapse of six\nyears since some of these prisoners were captured and\nincarcerated, that stand at odds with the repeated sugges-\ntions of the dissenters that these cases should be seen as a\njudicial victory in a contest for power between the Court\nand the political branches. See post, at 2, 3, 28 (ROBERTS,\nC. J., dissenting); post, at 5, 6, 17, 18, 25 (SCALIA, J., dis-\nsenting). The several answers to the charge of triumphal-\nism might start with a basic fact of Anglo-American con-\nstitutional history: that the power, first of the Crown and\nnow of the Executive Branch of the United States, is nec-\nessarily limited by habeas corpus jurisdiction to enquire\ninto the legality of executive detention. And one could\nexplain that in this Court\u2019s exercise of responsibility to\npreserve habeas corpus something much more significant\nis involved than pulling and hauling between the judicial\nand political branches. Instead, though, it is enough to\nrepeat that some of these petitioners have spent six years\nbehind bars. After six years of sustained executive deten-\ntions in Guantanamo, subject to habeas jurisdiction but\nwithout any actual habeas scrutiny, today\u2019s decision is no\njudicial victory, but an act of perseverance in trying to\nmake habeas review, and the obligation of the courts to\nprovide it, mean something of value both to prisoners and\nto the Nation.

The po\u00ad\nlitical branches crafted these procedures amidst an ongo\u00ad\ning military conflict, after much careful investigation and\nthorough debate. The Court rejects them today out of\nhand, without bothering to say what due process rights\nthe detainees possess, without explaining how the statute\nfails to vindicate those rights, and before a single peti\u00ad\ntioner has even attempted to avail himself of the law\u2019s\noperation. And to what effect? The majority merely re\u00ad\nplaces a review system designed by the people\u2019s represen\u00ad\ntatives with a set of shapeless procedures to be defined by\nfederal courts at some future date. One cannot help but\n2                   BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthink, after surveying the modest practical results of the\nmajority\u2019s ambitious opinion, that this decision is not\nreally about the detainees at all, but about control of\nfederal policy regarding enemy combatants.\n  The majority is adamant that the Guantanamo detain\u00ad\nees are entitled to the protections of habeas corpus\u2014its\nopinion begins by deciding that question. I regard the\nissue as a difficult one, primarily because of the unique\nand unusual jurisdictional status of Guantanamo Bay. I\nnonetheless agree with JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s analysis of our\nprecedents and the pertinent history of the writ, and\naccordingly join his dissent. The important point for me,\nhowever, is that the Court should have resolved these\ncases on other grounds. Habeas is most fundamentally a\nprocedural right, a mechanism for contesting the legality\nof executive detention. The critical threshold question in\nthese cases, prior to any inquiry about the writ\u2019s scope, is\nwhether the system the political branches designed pro\u00ad\ntects whatever rights the detainees may possess. If so,\nthere is no need for any additional process, whether called\n\u201chabeas\u201d or something else.\n  Congress entrusted that threshold question in the first\ninstance to the Court of Appeals for the District of Colum\u00ad\nbia Circuit, as the Constitution surely allows Congress to do.\nSee Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), \u00a71005(e)(2)(A),\n119 Stat. 2742. But before the D. C. Circuit has addressed\nthe issue, the Court cashiers the statute, and without\nanswering this critical threshold question itself. The\nCourt does eventually get around to asking whether re\u00ad\nview under the DTA is, as the Court frames it, an \u201cade\u00ad\nquate substitute\u201d for habeas, ante, at 42, but even then its\nopinion fails to determine what rights the detainees pos\u00ad\nsess and whether the DTA system satisfies them. The\nmajority instead compares the undefined DTA process to\nan equally undefined habeas right\u2014one that is to be given\nshape only in the future by district courts on a case-by\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncase basis. This whole approach is misguided.\n  It is also fruitless. How the detainees\u2019 claims will be\ndecided now that the DTA is gone is anybody\u2019s guess. But\nthe habeas process the Court mandates will most likely\nend up looking a lot like the DTA system it replaces, as\nthe district court judges shaping it will have to reconcile\nreview of the prisoners\u2019 detention with the undoubted\nneed to protect the American people from the terrorist\nthreat\u2014precisely the challenge Congress undertook in\ndrafting the DTA. All that today\u2019s opinion has done is\nshift responsibility for those sensitive foreign policy and\nnational security decisions from the elected branches to\nthe Federal Judiciary.\n  I believe the system the political branches constructed\nadequately protects any constitutional rights aliens cap\u00ad\ntured abroad and detained as enemy combatants may\nenjoy. I therefore would dismiss these cases on that\nground. With all respect for the contrary views of the\nmajority, I must dissent.\n                             I\n   The Court\u2019s opinion makes plain that certiorari to re\u00ad\nview these cases should never have been granted. As two\nMembers of today\u2019s majority once recognized, \u201ctraditional\nrules governing our decision of constitutional questions\nand our practice of requiring the exhaustion of available\nremedies . . . make it appropriate to deny these petitions.\u201d\nBoumediene v. Bush, 549 U. S. ___ (2007) (slip op., at 1)\n(citation omitted) (statement of STEVENS and KENNEDY,\nJJ., respecting denial of certiorari). Just so. Given the\nposture in which these cases came to us, the Court should\nhave declined to intervene until the D. C. Circuit had\nassessed the nature and validity of the congressionally\nmandated proceedings in a given detainee\u2019s case.\n   The political branches created a two-part, collateral\nreview procedure for testing the legality of the prisoners\u2019\n4                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ndetention: It begins with a hearing before a Combatant\nStatus Review Tribunal (CSRT) followed by review in the\nD. C. Circuit. As part of that review, Congress authorized\nthe D. C. Circuit to decide whether the CSRT proceedings\nare consistent with \u201cthe Constitution and laws of the\nUnited States.\u201d DTA \u00a71005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742. No\npetitioner, however, has invoked the D. C. Circuit review\nthe statute specifies. See 476 F. 3d 981, 994, and n. 16\n(CADC 2007); Brief for Federal Respondents 41\u201343. As a\nconsequence, that court has had no occasion to decide\nwhether the CSRT hearings, followed by review in the\nCourt of Appeals, vindicate whatever constitutional and\nstatutory rights petitioners may possess. See 476 F. 3d, at\n994, and n. 16.\n   Remarkably, this Court does not require petitioners to\nexhaust their remedies under the statute; it does not wait\nto see whether those remedies will prove sufficient to\nprotect petitioners\u2019 rights. Instead, it not only denies the\nD. C. Circuit the opportunity to assess the statute\u2019s reme\u00ad\ndies, it refuses to do so itself: the majority expressly de\u00ad\nclines to decide whether the CSRT procedures, coupled\nwith Article III review, satisfy due process. See ante, at\n54.\n   It is grossly premature to pronounce on the detainees\u2019\nright to habeas without first assessing whether the reme\u00ad\ndies the DTA system provides vindicate whatever rights\npetitioners may claim. The plurality in Hamdi v. Rums-\nfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 533 (2004), explained that the Consti\u00ad\ntution guaranteed an American citizen challenging his\ndetention as an enemy combatant the right to \u201cnotice of\nthe factual basis for his classification, and a fair opportu\u00ad\nnity to rebut the Government\u2019s factual assertions before a\nneutral decisionmaker.\u201d The plurality specifically stated\nthat constitutionally adequate collateral process could be\nprovided \u201cby an appropriately authorized and properly\nconstituted military tribunal,\u201d given the \u201cuncommon\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\npotential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing\nmilitary conflict.\u201d Id., at 533, 538. This point is directly\npertinent here, for surely the Due Process Clause does not\nafford non-citizens in such circumstances greater protec\u00ad\ntion than citizens are due.\n   If the CSRT procedures meet the minimal due process\nrequirements outlined in Hamdi, and if an Article III\ncourt is available to ensure that these procedures are\nfollowed in future cases, see id., at 536; INS v. St. Cyr, 533\nU. S. 289, 304 (2001); Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U. S. 229,\n236 (1953), there is no need to reach the Suspension\nClause question. Detainees will have received all the\nprocess the Constitution could possibly require, whether\nthat process is called \u201chabeas\u201d or something else. The\nquestion of the writ\u2019s reach need not be addressed.\n   This is why the Court should have required petitioners\nto exhaust their remedies under the statute. As we ex\u00ad\nplained in Gusik v. Schilder, 340 U. S. 128, 132 (1950), \u201cIf\nan available procedure has not been employed to rectify\nthe alleged error\u201d petitioners complain of, \u201cany interfer\u00ad\nence by [a] federal court may be wholly needless. The\nprocedure established to police the errors of the tribunal\nwhose judgment is challenged may be adequate for the\noccasion.\u201d Because the majority refuses to assess whether\nthe CSRTs comport with the Constitution, it ends up\nrazing a system of collateral review that it admits may in\nfact satisfy the Due Process Clause and be \u201cstructurally\nsound.\u201d Ante, at 56. But if the collateral review proce\u00ad\ndures Congress has provided\u2014CSRT review coupled with\nArticle III scrutiny\u2014are sound, interference by a federal\nhabeas court may be entirely unnecessary.\n   The only way to know is to require petitioners to use the\nalternative procedures Congress designed. Mandating\nthat the petitioners exhaust their statutory remedies \u201cis in\nno sense a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. It is\nmerely a deferment of resort to the writ until other correc\u00ad\n6                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntive procedures are shown to be futile.\u201d Gusik, supra, at\n132. So too here, it is not necessary to consider the avail\u00ad\nability of the writ until the statutory remedies have been\nshown to be inadequate to protect the detainees\u2019 rights.\nCf. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(b)(1)(A) (\u201cAn application for a writ of\nhabeas corpus . . . shall not be granted unless it appears\nthat . . . the applicant has exhausted the remedies avail\u00ad\nable in the courts of the State\u201d). Respect for the judg\u00ad\nments of Congress\u2014whose Members take the same oath\nwe do to uphold the Constitution\u2014requires no less.\n   In the absence of any assessment of the DTA\u2019s remedies,\nthe question whether detainees are entitled to habeas is\nan entirely speculative one. Our precedents have long\ncounseled us to avoid deciding such hypothetical questions\nof constitutional law. See Spector Motor Service, Inc. v.\nMcLaughlin, 323 U. S. 101, 105 (1944) (\u201cIf there is one\ndoctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process\nof constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to\npass on questions of constitutionality . . . unless such\n[questions are] unavoidable\u201d); see also Ashwander v. TVA,\n297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (Con\u00ad\nstitutional questions should not be decided unless \u201c \u2018abso\u00ad\nlutely necessary to a decision of the case\u2019 \u201d (quoting Burton\nv. United States, 196 U. S. 283, 295 (1905))). This is a\n\u201cfundamental rule of judicial restraint.\u201d Three Affiliated\nTribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering,\nP. C., 467 U. S. 138, 157 (1984).\n   The Court acknowledges that \u201cthe ordinary course\u201d\nwould be not to decide the constitutionality of the DTA at\nthis stage, but abandons that \u201cordinary course\u201d in light of\nthe \u201cgravity\u201d of the constitutional issues presented and the\nprospect of additional delay. Ante, at 43. It is, however,\nprecisely when the issues presented are grave that adher\u00ad\nence to the ordinary course is most important. A principle\napplied only when unimportant is not much of a principle\nat all, and charges of judicial activism are most effectively\n                      Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                    7\n\n                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nrebutted when courts can fairly argue they are following\nnormal practices.\n   The Court is also concerned that requiring petitioners to\npursue \u201cDTA review before proceeding with their habeas\ncorpus actions\u201d could involve additional delay. Ante, at 66.\nThe nature of the habeas remedy the Court instructs\nlower courts to craft on remand, however, is far more\nunsettled than the process Congress provided in the DTA.\nSee ante, at 69 (\u201c[O]ur opinion does not address the con\u00ad\ntent of the law that governs petitioners\u2019 detention. That is\na matter yet to be determined\u201d). There is no reason to\nsuppose that review according to procedures the Federal\nJudiciary will design, case by case, will proceed any faster\nthan the DTA process petitioners disdained.\n   On the contrary, the system the Court has launched\n(and directs lower courts to elaborate) promises to take\nlonger. The Court assures us that before bringing their\nhabeas petitions, detainees must usually complete the\nCSRT process. See ante, at 66. Then they may seek re\u00ad\nview in federal district court. Either success or failure\nthere will surely result in an appeal to the D. C. Circuit\u2014\nexactly where judicial review starts under Congress\u2019s\nsystem. The effect of the Court\u2019s decision is to add addi\u00ad\ntional layers of quite possibly redundant review. And\nbecause nobody knows how these new layers of \u201chabeas\u201d\nreview will operate, or what new procedures they will\nrequire, their contours will undoubtedly be subject to fresh\nbouts of litigation. If the majority were truly concerned\nabout delay, it would have required petitioners to use the\nDTA process that has been available to them for 21\u20442 years,\nwith its Article III review in the D. C. Circuit. That sys\u00ad\ntem might well have provided petitioners all the relief to\nwhich they are entitled long before the Court\u2019s newly\ninstalled habeas review could hope to do so.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 In   light of the foregoing, the concurrence is wrong to suggest that I\n8                       BOUMEDIENE v.

J., dissenting\n\n  The Court\u2019s refusal to require petitioners to exhaust the\nremedies provided by Congress violates the \u201ctraditional\nrules governing our decision of constitutional questions.\u201d\nBoumediene, 549 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (statement of\nSTEVENS and KENNEDY, JJ., respecting denial of certio\u00ad\nrari). The Court\u2019s disrespect for these rules makes its\ndecision an awkward business. It rushes to decide the\nfundamental question of the reach of habeas corpus when\nthe functioning of the DTA may make that decision entirely\nunnecessary, and it does so with scant idea of how DTA\njudicial review will actually operate.\n                              II\n   The majority\u2019s overreaching is particularly egregious\ngiven the weakness of its objections to the DTA. Simply\nput, the Court\u2019s opinion fails on its own terms. The major\u00ad\nity strikes down the statute because it is not an \u201cadequate\nsubstitute\u201d for habeas review, ante, at 42, but fails to show\nwhat rights the detainees have that cannot be vindicated\nby the DTA system.\n   Because the central purpose of habeas corpus is to test\nthe legality of executive detention, the writ requires most\nfundamentally an Article III court able to hear the pris\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cinsufficiently appreciat[e]\u201d the issue of delay in these cases. See ante,\nat 2 (opinion of SOUTER, J.). This Court issued its decisions in Rasul v.\nBush, 542 U. S. 466, and Hamdi v. Rumsfeld 542 U. S. 507, in 2004.\nThe concurrence makes it sound as if the political branches have done\nnothing in the interim. In fact, Congress responded 18 months later by\nenacting the DTA. Congress cannot be faulted for taking that time to\nconsider how best to accommodate both the detainees\u2019 interests and the\nneed to keep the American people safe. Since the DTA became law,\npetitioners have steadfastly refused to avail themselves of the statute\u2019s\nreview mechanisms. It is unfair to complain that the DTA system\ninvolves too much delay when petitioners have consistently refused to\nuse it, preferring to litigate instead. Today\u2019s decision obligating district\ncourts to craft new procedures to replace those in the DTA will only\nprolong the process\u2014and delay relief.\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

S. 443, 533 (1953) (Jackson, J.,\nconcurring in result). Beyond that, the process a given\nprisoner is entitled to receive depends on the circum\u00ad\nstances and the rights of the prisoner. See Mathews v.\nEldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335 (1976). After much hemming\nand hawing, the majority appears to concede that the DTA\nprovides an Article III court competent to order release.\nSee ante, at 61. The only issue in dispute is the process\nthe Guantanamo prisoners are entitled to use to test the\nlegality of their detention. Hamdi concluded that Ameri\u00ad\ncan citizens detained as enemy combatants are entitled to\nonly limited process, and that much of that process could\nbe supplied by a military tribunal, with review to follow in\nan Article III court. That is precisely the system we have\nhere. It is adequate to vindicate whatever due process\nrights petitioners may have.\n                              A\n   The Court reaches the opposite conclusion partly be\u00ad\ncause it misreads the statute. The majority appears not to\nunderstand how the review system it invalidates actually\nworks\u2014specifically, how CSRT review and review by the\nD. C. Circuit fit together. After briefly acknowledging in\nits recitation of the facts that the Government designed\nthe CSRTs \u201cto comply with the due process requirements\nidentified by the plurality in Hamdi,\u201d ante, at 3, the Court\nproceeds to dismiss the tribunal proceedings as no more\nthan a suspect method used by the Executive for deter\u00ad\nmining the status of the detainees in the first instance, see\nante, at 43. This leads the Court to treat the review the\nDTA provides in the D. C. Circuit as the only opportunity\ndetainees have to challenge their status determination.\nSee ante, at 49.\n   The Court attempts to explain its glancing treatment of\nthe CSRTs by arguing that \u201c[w]hether one characterizes\n10                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe CSRT process as direct review of the Executive\u2019s bat\u00ad\ntlefield determination . . . or as the first step in the collat\u00ad\neral review of a battlefield determination makes no differ\u00ad\nence.\u201d Ante, at 54. First of all, the majority is quite wrong\nto dismiss the Executive\u2019s determination of detainee\nstatus as no more than a \u201cbattlefield\u201d judgment, as if it\nwere somehow provisional and made in great haste. In\nfact, detainees are designated \u201cenemy combatants\u201d only\nafter \u201cmultiple levels of review by military officers and\nofficials of the Department of Defense.\u201d Memorandum of\nthe Secretary of the Navy, Implementation of Combatant\nStatus Review Tribunal Procedures for Enemy Combat\u00ad\nants Detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (July 29,\n2004), App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\u20131196, p. 150 (here\u00ad\ninafter Implementation Memo).\n   The majority is equally wrong to characterize the\nCSRTs as part of that initial determination process. They\nare instead a means for detainees to challenge the Gov\u00ad\nernment\u2019s determination. The Executive designed the\nCSRTs to mirror Army Regulation 190\u20138, see Brief for\nFederal Respondents 48, the very procedural model the\nplurality in Hamdi said provided the type of process an\nenemy combatant could expect from a habeas court, see\n542 U. S., at 538 (plurality opinion). The CSRTs operate\nmuch as habeas courts would if hearing the detainee\u2019s\ncollateral challenge for the first time: They gather evi\u00ad\ndence, call witnesses, take testimony, and render a deci\u00ad\nsion on the legality of the Government\u2019s detention. See\nImplementation Memo, App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\u2013\n1196, at 153\u2013162. If the CSRT finds a particular detainee\nhas been improperly held, it can order release. See id., at\n164.\n   The majority insists that even if \u201cthe CSRTs satisf[ied]\ndue process standards,\u201d full habeas review would still be\nnecessary, because habeas is a collateral remedy available\neven to prisoners \u201cdetained pursuant to the most rigorous\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)          11\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nproceedings imaginable.\u201d Ante, at 55, 56. This comment\nmakes sense only if the CSRTs are incorrectly viewed as a\nmethod used by the Executive for determining the prison\u00ad\ners\u2019 status, and not as themselves part of the collateral\nreview to test the validity of that determination. See\nGusik, 340 U. S., at 132. The majority can deprecate the\nimportance of the CSRTs only by treating them as some\u00ad\nthing they are not.\n   The use of a military tribunal such as the CSRTs to\nreview the aliens\u2019 detention should be familiar to this\nCourt in light of the Hamdi plurality, which said that the\ndue process rights enjoyed by American citizens detained\nas enemy combatants could be vindicated \u201cby an appropri\u00ad\nately authorized and properly constituted military tribu\u00ad\nnal.\u201d 542 U. S., at 538. The DTA represents Congress\u2019\nconsidered attempt to provide the accused alien combat\u00ad\nants detained at Guantanamo a constitutionally adequate\nopportunity to contest their detentions before just such a\ntribunal.\n   But Congress went further in the DTA. CSRT review is\njust the first tier of collateral review in the DTA system.\nThe statute provides additional review in an Article III\ncourt. Given the rationale of today\u2019s decision, it is well\nworth recalling exactly what the DTA provides in this\nrespect. The statute directs the D. C. Circuit to consider\nwhether a particular alien\u2019s status determination \u201cwas\nconsistent with the standards and procedures specified by\nthe Secretary of Defense\u201d and \u201cwhether the use of such\nstandards and procedures to make the determination is\nconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United\nStates.\u201d DTA \u00a71005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742. That is, a\ncourt determines whether the CSRT procedures are consti\u00ad\ntutional, and a court determines whether those procedures\nwere followed in a particular case.\n   In short, the Hamdi plurality concluded that this type of\nreview would be enough to satisfy due process, even for\n12                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncitizens. See 542 U. S., at 538. Congress followed the\nCourt\u2019s lead, only to find itself the victim of a constitu\u00ad\ntional bait and switch.\n   Hamdi merits scant attention from the Court\u2014a re\u00ad\nmarkable omission, as Hamdi bears directly on the issues\nbefore us. The majority attempts to dismiss Hamdi\u2019s\nrelevance by arguing that because the availability of\n\u00a72241 federal habeas was never in doubt in that case, \u201cthe\nCourt had no occasion to define the necessary scope of\nhabeas review . . . in the context of enemy combatant\ndetentions.\u201d Ante, at 55. Hardly. Hamdi was all about\nthe scope of habeas review in the context of enemy com\u00ad\nbatant detentions. The petitioner, an American citizen\nheld within the United States as an enemy combatant,\ninvoked the writ to challenge his detention. 542 U. S., at\n510\u2013511. After \u201ca careful examination both of the writ . . .\nand of the Due Process Clause,\u201d this Court enunciated the\n\u201cbasic process\u201d the Constitution entitled Hamdi to expect\nfrom a habeas court under \u00a72241. Id., at 525, 534. That\nprocess consisted of the right to \u201creceive notice of the\nfactual basis for his classification, and a fair opportunity\nto rebut the Government\u2019s factual assertions before a\nneutral decisionmaker.\u201d Id., at 533. In light of the Gov\u00ad\nernment\u2019s national security responsibilities, the plurality\nfound the process could be \u201ctailored to alleviate [the]\nuncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of\nongoing military conflict.\u201d Ibid. For example, the Gov\u00ad\nernment could rely on hearsay and could claim a presump\u00ad\ntion in favor of its own evidence. See id., at 533\u2013534.\n   Hamdi further suggested that this \u201cbasic process\u201d on\ncollateral review could be provided by a military tribunal.\nIt pointed to prisoner-of-war tribunals as a model that\nwould satisfy the Constitution\u2019s requirements. See id., at\n538. Only \u201c[i]n the absence of such process\u201d before a mili\u00ad\ntary tribunal, the Court held, would Article III courts need\nto conduct full-dress habeas proceedings to \u201censure that\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)          13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe minimum requirements of due process are achieved.\u201d\nIbid. (emphasis added). And even then, the petitioner\nwould be entitled to no more process than he would have\nreceived from a properly constituted military review panel,\ngiven his limited due process rights and the Government\u2019s\nweighty interests. See id., at 533\u2013534, 538.\n   Contrary to the majority, Hamdi is of pressing relevance\nbecause it establishes the procedures American citizens\ndetained as enemy combatants can expect from a habeas\ncourt proceeding under \u00a72241. The DTA system of military\ntribunal hearings followed by Article III review looks a lot\nlike the procedure Hamdi blessed. If nothing else, it is\nplain from the design of the DTA that Congress, the\nPresident, and this Nation\u2019s military leaders have made a\ngood-faith effort to follow our precedent.\n   The Court, however, will not take \u201cyes\u201d for an answer.\nThe majority contends that \u201c[i]f Congress had envisioned\nDTA review as coextensive with traditional habeas corpus,\u201d\nit would have granted the D. C. Circuit far broader review\nauthority. Ante, at 48. Maybe so, but that comment reveals\nthe majority\u2019s misunderstanding. \u201c[T]raditional habeas\ncorpus\u201d takes no account of what Hamdi recognized as the\n\u201cuncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of\nongoing military conflict.\u201d 542 U. S., at 533. Besides, Con\u00ad\ngress and the Executive did not envision \u201cDTA review\u201d\u2014\nby which I assume the Court means D. C. Circuit review,\nsee ante, at 48\u2014as the detainees\u2019 only opportunity to\nchallenge their detentions. Instead, the political branches\ncrafted CSRT and D. C. Circuit review to operate together,\nwith the goal of providing noncitizen detainees the level of\ncollateral process Hamdi said would satisfy the due proc\u00ad\ness rights of American citizens. See Brief for Federal\nRespondents 48\u201353.\n                         B\n  Given the statutory scheme the political branches\n14                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nadopted, and given Hamdi, it simply will not do for the\nmajority to dismiss the CSRT procedures as \u201cfar more\nlimited\u201d than those used in military trials, and therefore\nbeneath the level of process \u201cthat would eliminate the\nneed for habeas corpus review.\u201d Ante, at 37. The question\nis not how much process the CSRTs provide in comparison\nto other modes of adjudication. The question is whether\nthe CSRT procedures\u2014coupled with the judicial review\nspecified by the DTA\u2014provide the \u201cbasic process\u201d Hamdi\nsaid the Constitution affords American citizens detained\nas enemy combatants. See 542 U. S., at 534.\n   By virtue of its refusal to allow the D. C. Circuit to\nassess petitioners\u2019 statutory remedies, and by virtue of its\nown refusal to consider, at the outset, the fit between\nthose remedies and due process, the majority now finds\nitself in the position of evaluating whether the DTA sys\u00ad\ntem is an adequate substitute for habeas review without\nknowing what rights either habeas or the DTA is supposed\nto protect. The majority attempts to elide this problem by\nholding that petitioners have a right to habeas corpus and\nthen comparing the DTA against the \u201chistoric office\u201d of the\nwrit. Ante, at 47. But habeas is, as the majority acknowl\u00ad\nedges, a flexible remedy rather than a substantive right.\nIts \u201cprecise application . . . change[s] depending upon the\ncircumstances.\u201d Ante, at 50. The shape of habeas review\nultimately depends on the nature of the rights a petitioner\nmay assert. See, e.g., Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 75 (1957)\n(Harlan, J., concurring in result) (\u201c[T]he question of which\nspecific safeguards of the Constitution are appropriately to\nbe applied in a particular context . . . can be reduced to the\nissue of what process is \u2018due\u2019 a defendant in the particular\ncircumstances of a particular case\u201d).\n   The scope of federal habeas review is traditionally more\nlimited in some contexts than in others, depending on the\nstatus of the detainee and the rights he may assert. See\nSt. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 306 (\u201cIn [immigration cases], other\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            15\n\n                    ROBERTS, C.

Wilson, 346 U. S. 137, 139\n(1953) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[I]n military habeas corpus the\ninquiry, the scope of matters open for review, has always\nbeen more narrow than in civil cases\u201d); In re Yamashita,\n327 U.

S.\n1, 25 (1942) (federal habeas review of military commission\nverdict limited to determining commission\u2019s jurisdiction).\n   Declaring that petitioners have a right to habeas in no\nway excuses the Court from explaining why the DTA does\nnot protect whatever due process or statutory rights peti\u00ad\ntioners may have. Because if the DTA provides a means\nfor vindicating petitioners\u2019 rights, it is necessarily an\nadequate substitute for habeas corpus. See Swain v.\nPressley, 430 U. S. 372, 381 (1977); United States v. Hay-\nman, 342 U. S. 205, 223 (1952).\n   For my part, I will assume that any due process rights\npetitioners may possess are no greater than those of\nAmerican citizens detained as enemy combatants. It is\nworth noting again that the Hamdi controlling opinion\nsaid the Constitution guarantees citizen detainees only\n\u201cbasic\u201d procedural rights, and that the process for securing\nthose rights can \u201cbe tailored to alleviate [the] uncommon\npotential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing\nmilitary conflict.\u201d 542 U. S., at 533. The majority, how\u00ad\never, objects that \u201cthe procedural protections afforded to\nthe detainees in the CSRT hearings are . . . limited.\u201d Ante,\nat 37. But the evidentiary and other limitations the Court\ncomplains of reflect the nature of the issue in contest,\nnamely, the status of aliens captured by our Armed Forces\n16                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nabroad and alleged to be enemy combatants. Contrary to\nthe repeated suggestions of the majority, DTA review need\nnot parallel the habeas privileges enjoyed by noncombat\u00ad\nant American citizens, as set out in 28 U. S. C. \u00a72241\n(2000 ed. and Supp V). Cf. ante, at 46\u201347. It need only\nprovide process adequate for noncitizens detained as\nalleged combatants.\n   To what basic process are these detainees due as habeas\npetitioners? We have said that \u201cat the absolute mini\u00ad\nmum,\u201d the Suspension Clause protects the writ \u201c \u2018as it\nexisted in 1789.\u2019 \u201d St. Cyr, supra, at 301 (quoting Felker v.\nTurpin, 518 U. S. 651, 663\u2013664 (1996)). The majority\nadmits that a number of historical authorities suggest\nthat at the time of the Constitution\u2019s ratification, \u201ccom\u00ad\nmon-law courts abstained altogether from matters involv\u00ad\ning prisoners of war.\u201d Ante, at 17. If this is accurate, the\nprocess provided prisoners under the DTA is plainly more\nthan sufficient\u2014it allows alleged combatants to challenge\nboth the factual and legal bases of their detentions.\n   Assuming the constitutional baseline is more robust, the\nDTA still provides adequate process, and by the majority\u2019s\nown standards. Today\u2019s Court opines that the Suspension\nClause guarantees prisoners such as the detainees \u201ca\nmeaningful opportunity to demonstrate that [they are]\nbeing held pursuant to the erroneous application or inter\u00ad\npretation of relevant law.\u201d Ante, at 50 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Further, the Court holds that to be an\nadequate substitute, any tribunal reviewing the detainees\u2019\ncases \u201cmust have the power to order the conditional re\u00ad\nlease of an individual unlawfully detained.\u201d Ibid. The\nDTA system\u2014CSRT review of the Executive\u2019s determina\u00ad\ntion followed by D. C.

See Implementation Memo, App. J to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 06\u20131196, at 154\u2013156, 158\u2013159, 161.\n   While the Court concedes detainees may confront all\nwitnesses called before the tribunal, it suggests this right\nis \u201cmore theoretical than real\u201d because \u201cthere are in effect\nno limits on the admission of hearsay evidence.\u201d Ante, at\n55. The Court further complains that petitioners lack \u201cthe\nassistance of counsel,\u201d and\u2014given the limits on their\naccess to classified information\u2014\u201cmay not be aware of the\nmost critical allegations\u201d against them. Ante, at 54. None\nof these complaints is persuasive.\n   Detainees not only have the opportunity to confront any\nwitness who appears before the tribunal, they may call\nwitnesses of their own. The Implementation Memo re\u00ad\nquires only that detainees\u2019 witnesses be \u201creasonably avail\u00ad\nable,\u201d App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\u20131196, at 155, a\nrequirement drawn from Army Regulation 190\u20138, ch. 1,\n\u00a71\u20136(e)(6), and entirely consistent with the Government\u2019s\ninterest in avoiding \u201ca futile search for evidence\u201d that\nmight burden warmaking responsibilities, Hamdi, supra,\nat 532. The dangerous mission assigned to our forces\nabroad is to fight terrorists, not serve subpoenas. The\nCourt is correct that some forms of hearsay evidence are\nadmissible before the CSRT, but Hamdi expressly ap\u00ad\nproved this use of hearsay by habeas courts. 542 U. S.,\nat 533\u2013534 (\u201cHearsay, for example, may need to be ac\u00ad\ncepted as the most reliable available evidence from the\nGovernment\u201d).\n   As to classified information, while detainees are not\npermitted access to it themselves, the Implementation\n18                 BOUMEDIENE v.

Implementa\u00ad\ntion Memo, supra, at 152, 154\u2013155, 156; Brief for Federal\nRespondents 54\u201355. The prisoner\u2019s counsel enjoys the\nsame privilege on appeal before the D. C. Circuit. That is\nmore access to classified material for alleged alien enemy\ncombatants than ever before provided. I am not aware of\na single instance\u2014and certainly the majority cites none\u2014\nin which detainees such as petitioners have been provided\naccess to classified material in any form. Indeed, prison\u00ad\ners of war who challenge their status determinations\nunder the Geneva Convention are afforded no such access,\nsee Army Regulation 190\u20138, ch. 1, \u00a7\u00a71\u20136(e)(3) and (5), and\nthe prisoner-of-war model is the one Hamdi cited as con\u00ad\nsistent with the demands of due process for citizens, see\n542 U. S., at 538.\n   What alternative does the Court propose? Allow free\naccess to classified information and ignore the risk the\nprisoner may eventually convey what he learns to parties\nhostile to this country, with deadly consequences for those\nwho helped apprehend the detainee? If the Court can\ndesign a better system for communicating to detainees the\nsubstance of any classified information relevant to their\ncases, without fatally compromising national security\ninterests and sources, the majority should come forward\nwith it. Instead, the majority fobs that vexing question off\non district courts to answer down the road.\n   Prisoners of war are not permitted access to classified\ninformation, and neither are they permitted access to\ncounsel, another supposed failing of the CSRT process.\nAnd yet the Guantanamo detainees are hardly denied all\nlegal assistance. They are provided a \u201cPersonal Represen\u00ad\ntative\u201d who, as previously noted, may access classified\ninformation, help the detainee arrange for witnesses,\nassist the detainee\u2019s preparation of his case, and even aid\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

The provision\nfor a personal representative on this order is one of several\nways in which the CSRT procedures are more generous\nthan those provided prisoners of war under Army Regula\u00ad\ntion 190\u20138.\n    Keep in mind that all this is just at the CSRT stage.\nDetainees receive additional process before the D. C.\nCircuit, including full access to appellate counsel and the\nright to challenge the factual and legal bases of their\ndetentions. DTA \u00a71005(e)(2)(C) empowers the Court of\nAppeals to determine not only whether the CSRT observed\nthe \u201cprocedures specified by the Secretary of Defense,\u201d but\nalso \u201cwhether the use of such standards and procedures\n. . . is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the\nUnited States.\u201d 119 Stat. 2742. These provisions permit\ndetainees to dispute the sufficiency of the evidence against\nthem. They allow detainees to challenge a CSRT panel\u2019s\ninterpretation of any relevant law, and even the constitu\u00ad\ntionality of the CSRT proceedings themselves. This in\u00ad\ncludes, as the Solicitor General acknowledges, the ability\nto dispute the Government\u2019s right to detain alleged com\u00ad\nbatants in the first place, and to dispute the Government\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cenemy combatant.\u201d Brief for Federal Re\u00ad\nspondents 59. All this before an Article III court\u2014plainly\na neutral decisionmaker.\n    All told, the DTA provides the prisoners held at Guan\u00ad\ntanamo Bay adequate opportunity to contest the bases of\ntheir detentions, which is all habeas corpus need allow.\nThe DTA provides more opportunity and more process, in\nfact, than that afforded prisoners of war or any other\nalleged enemy combatants in history.\n                         D\n  Despite these guarantees, the Court finds the DTA\nsystem an inadequate habeas substitute, for one central\n20                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nreason: Detainees are unable to introduce at the appeal\nstage exculpatory evidence discovered after the conclusion\nof their CSRT proceedings. See ante, at 58. The Court\nhints darkly that the DTA may suffer from other infirmi\u00ad\nties, see ante, at 63 (\u201cWe do not imply DTA review would\nbe a constitutionally sufficient replacement for habeas\ncorpus but for these limitations on the detainee\u2019s ability to\npresent exculpatory evidence\u201d), but it does not bother to\nname them, making a response a bit difficult. As it\nstands, I can only assume the Court regards the supposed\ndefect it did identify as the gravest of the lot.\n   If this is the most the Court can muster, the ice beneath\nits feet is thin indeed. As noted, the CSRT procedures\nprovide ample opportunity for detainees to introduce\nexculpatory evidence\u2014whether documentary in nature or\nfrom live witnesses\u2014before the military tribunals. See\ninfra, at 21\u201323; Implementation Memo, App. J to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 06\u2013196, at 155\u2013156. And if their ability to\nintroduce such evidence is denied contrary to the Consti\u00ad\ntution or laws of the United States, the D. C. Circuit has\nthe authority to say so on review.\n   Nevertheless, the Court asks us to imagine an instance\nin which evidence is discovered after the CSRT panel\nrenders its decision, but before the Court of Appeals re\u00ad\nviews the detainee\u2019s case. This scenario, which of course\nhas not yet come to pass as no review in the D. C. Circuit\nhas occurred, provides no basis for rejecting the DTA as a\nhabeas substitute. While the majority is correct that the\nDTA does not contemplate the introduction of \u201cnewly\ndiscovered\u201d evidence before the Court of Appeals, petition\u00ad\ners and the Solicitor General agree that the DTA does\npermit the D. C. Circuit to remand a detainee\u2019s case for a\nnew CSRT determination. Brief for Petitioner Boumedi\u00ad\nene et al. in No. 06\u20131195, at 30; Brief for Federal Respon\u00ad\ndents 60\u201361.

J., dissenting\n\nwould have been considered by the tribunal below had it\nonly been available, the D. C. Circuit could readily remand\nthe case to the tribunal to allow that body to consider the\nevidence in the first instance. The Court of Appeals could\nlater review any new or reinstated decision in light of the\nsupplemented record.\n   If that sort of procedure sounds familiar, it should.\nFederal appellate courts reviewing factual determinations\nfollow just such a procedure in a variety of circumstances.\nSee, e.g., United States v. White, 492 F. 3d 380, 413 (CA6\n2007) (remanding new-evidence claim to the district court\nfor a Brady evidentiary hearing); Avila v. Roe, 298 F. 3d\n750, 754 (CA9 2002) (remanding habeas claim to the\ndistrict court for evidentiary hearing to clarify factual\nrecord); United States v. Leone, 215 F. 3d 253, 256 (CA2\n2000) (observing that when faced on direct appeal with an\nunderdeveloped claim for ineffective assistance of counsel,\nthe appellate court may remand to the district court for\nnecessary factfinding).\n   A remand is not the only relief available for detainees\ncaught in the Court\u2019s hypothetical conundrum. The DTA\nexpressly directs the Secretary of Defense to \u201cprovide for\nperiodic review of any new evidence that may become\navailable relating to the enemy combatant status of a\ndetainee.\u201d DTA \u00a71005(a)(3). Regulations issued by the\nDepartment of Defense provide that when a detainee puts\nforward new, material evidence \u201cnot previously presented\nto the detainee\u2019s CSRT,\u201d the Deputy Secretary of Defense\n\u201c \u2018will direct that a CSRT convene to reconsider the basis of\nthe detainee\u2019s . . . status in light of the new information.\u2019 \u201d\nOffice for the Administrative Review of the Detention of\nEnemy Combatants, Instruction 5421.1, Procedure for\nReview of \u201cNew Evidence\u201d Relating to Enemy Combatant\n(EC) Status \u00b6\u00b64(a)(1), 5(b) (May 7, 2007); Brief for Federal\nRespondents 56, n. 30.

See 119 Stat. 2741. The Deputy\nSecretary of Defense has promulgated concomitant regula\u00ad\ntions establishing an Administrative Review Board to\nassess \u201cannually the need to continue to detain each en\u00ad\nemy combatant.\u201d Deputy Secretary of Defense Order OSD\n06942\u201304 (May 11, 2004), App. K to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n06\u20131196, p. 189. In the words of the implementing order,\nthe purpose of this annual review is to afford every de\u00ad\ntainee the opportunity \u201cto explain why he is no longer a\nthreat to the United States\u201d and should be released. Ibid.\nThe Board\u2019s findings are forwarded to a presidentially\nappointed, Senate-confirmed civilian within the Depart\u00ad\nment of Defense whom the Secretary of Defense has des\u00ad\nignated to administer the review process. This designated\ncivilian official has the authority to order release upon the\nBoard\u2019s recommendation. Id., at 201.\n   The Court\u2019s hand wringing over the DTA\u2019s treatment of\nlater-discovered exculpatory evidence is the most it has to\nshow after a roving search for constitutionally problematic\nscenarios. But \u201c[t]he delicate power of pronouncing an Act\nof Congress unconstitutional,\u201d we have said, \u201cis not to be\nexercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imag\u00ad\nined.\u201d United States v.

See ante, at 62\u201363. The answer is that the detainee can\npetition the D. C. Circuit for review. The DTA directs that the proce\u00ad\ndures for review of new evidence be included among \u201c[t]he procedures\nsubmitted under paragraph (1)(A)\u201d governing CSRT review of enemy\ncombatant status \u00a71405(a)(3), 119 Stat. 3476. It is undisputed that the\nD. C. Circuit has statutory authority to review and enforce these\nprocedures. See DTA \u00a71005(e)(2)(C)(i), id., at 2742.\n                  Cite as: 553 U.

J., dissenting\n\nand applies it with gusto: If there is any scenario in which\nthe statute might be constitutionally infirm, the law must\nbe struck down. Cf. United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S.\n739, 745 (1987) (\u201cA facial challenge . . . must establish that\nno set of circumstances exists under which the Act would\nbe valid\u201d); see also Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S.\n702, 739\u2013740, and n. 7 (1997) (STEVENS, J., concurring in\njudgments) (facial challenge must fail where the statute\nhas \u201c \u2018plainly legitimate sweep\u2019 \u201d (quoting Broadrick v.\nOklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 615 (1973))). The Court\u2019s new\nmethod of constitutional adjudication only underscores its\nfailure to follow our usual procedures and require peti\u00ad\ntioners to demonstrate that they have been harmed by the\nstatute they challenge. In the absence of such a concrete\nshowing, the Court is unable to imagine a plausible hypo\u00ad\nthetical in which the DTA is unconstitutional.\n                              E\n   The Court\u2019s second criterion for an adequate substitute\nis the \u201cpower to order the conditional release of an indi\u00ad\nvidual unlawfully detained.\u201d Ante, at 50. As the Court\nbasically admits, the DTA can be read to permit the D. C.\nCircuit to order release in light of our traditional princi\u00ad\nples of construing statutes to avoid difficult constitutional\nissues, when reasonably possible. See ante, at 56\u201357.\n   The Solicitor General concedes that remedial authority\nof some sort must be implied in the statute, given that the\nDTA\u2014like the general habeas law itself, see 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72243\u2014provides no express remedy of any kind. Brief for\nFederal Respondents 60\u201361. The parties agree that at the\nleast, the DTA empowers the D. C. Circuit to remand a\nprisoner\u2019s case to the CSRT with instructions to perform a\nnew status assessment. Brief for Petitioner Boumediene\net al. in No. 06\u20131195, at 30; Brief for Federal Respondents\n60\u201361. To avoid constitutional infirmity, it is reasonable\nto imply more, see Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 348 (Brandeis,\n24                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

S., at 299\u2013300, especially in\nview of the Solicitor General\u2019s concession at oral argument\nand in his Supplemental Brief that authority to release\nmight be read in the statute, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 37; Sup\u00ad\nplemental Brief for Federal Respondents 9.\n   The Court grudgingly suggests that \u201cCongress\u2019 silence\non the question of remedies suggests acquiescence to any\nconstitutionally required remedy.\u201d Ante, at 58. But the\nargument in favor of statutorily authorized release is\nstronger than that. The DTA\u2019s parallels to 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72243 on this score are noteworthy. By way of remedy,\nthe general federal habeas statute provides only that the\ncourt, having heard and determined the facts, shall \u201cdis\u00ad\npose of the matter as law and justice require.\u201d Ibid. We\nhave long held, and no party here disputes, that this\nincludes the power to order release. See Wilkinson v.\nDotson, 544 U. S. 74, 79 (2005) (\u201c[T]he writ\u2019s history\nmakes clear that it traditionally has been accepted as the\nspecific instrument to obtain release from [unlawful]\nconfinement\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The DTA can be similarly read. Because Congress\nsubstituted DTA review for habeas corpus and because\nthe \u201cunique purpose\u201d of the writ is \u201cto release the appli\u00ad\ncant . . . from unlawful confinement,\u201d Allen v. McCurry,\n449 U. S. 90, 98, n. 12 (1980), DTA \u00a71005(e)(2) can and\nshould be read to confer on the Court of Appeals the\nauthority to order release in appropriate circumstances.\nSection 1005(e)(2)(D) plainly contemplates release, ad\u00ad\ndressing the effect \u201crelease of [an] alien from the custody\nof the Department of Defense\u201d will have on the jurisdiction\nof the court. 119 Stat. 2742\u20132743.

J., dissenting\n\nserious constitutional difficulty and is consistent with the\ntext of the statute.\n  The D. C. Circuit can thus order release, the CSRTs can\norder release, and the head of the Administrative Review\nBoards can, at the recommendation of those panels, order\nrelease. These multiple release provisions within the DTA\nsystem more than satisfy the majority\u2019s requirement that\nany tribunal substituting for a habeas court have the\nauthority to release the prisoner.\n  The basis for the Court\u2019s contrary conclusion is summed\nup in the following sentence near the end of its opinion:\n\u201cTo hold that the detainees at Guantanamo may, under\nthe DTA, challenge the President\u2019s legal authority to\ndetain them, contest the CSRT\u2019s findings of fact, supple\u00ad\nment the record on review with newly discovered or previ\u00ad\nously unavailable evidence, and request an order of re\u00ad\nlease would come close to reinstating the \u00a72241 habeas\ncorpus process Congress sought to deny them.\u201d Ante, at\n63. In other words, any interpretation of the statute that\nwould make it an adequate substitute for habeas must be\nrejected, because Congress could not possibly have in\u00ad\ntended to enact an adequate substitute for habeas. The\nCourt could have saved itself a lot of trouble if it had\nsimply announced this Catch-22 approach at the begin\u00ad\nning rather than the end of its opinion.\n                             III\n  For all its eloquence about the detainees\u2019 right to the\nwrit, the Court makes no effort to elaborate how exactly\nthe remedy it prescribes will differ from the procedural\nprotections detainees enjoy under the DTA. The Court\nobjects to the detainees\u2019 limited access to witnesses and\nclassified material, but proposes no alternatives of its own.\nIndeed, it simply ignores the many difficult questions its\nholding presents. What, for example, will become of the\nCSRT process? The majority says federal courts should\n26                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ngenerally refrain from entertaining detainee challenges\nuntil after the petitioner\u2019s CSRT proceeding has finished.\nSee ante, at 66 (\u201c[e]xcept in cases of undue delay\u201d). But\nto what deference, if any, is that CSRT determination\nentitled?\n   There are other problems. Take witness availability.\nWhat makes the majority think witnesses will become\nmagically available when the review procedure is labeled\n\u201chabeas\u201d? Will the location of most of these witnesses\nchange\u2014will they suddenly become easily susceptible to\nservice of process? Or will subpoenas issued by American\nhabeas courts run to Basra? And if they did, how would\nthey be enforced? Speaking of witnesses, will detainees be\nable to call active-duty military officers as witnesses? If\nnot, why not?\n   The majority has no answers for these difficulties. What\nit does say leaves open the distinct possibility that its\n\u201chabeas\u201d remedy will, when all is said and done, end up\nlooking a great deal like the DTA review it rejects. See\nante, at 66 (opinion of the court) (\u201cWe recognize, however,\nthat the Government has a legitimate interest in protect\u00ad\ning sources and methods of intelligence gathering, and we\nexpect that the District Court will use its discretion to\naccommodate this interest to the greatest extent possi\u00ad\nble\u201d). But \u201c[t]he role of the judiciary is limited to deter\u00ad\nmining whether the procedures meet the essential stan\u00ad\ndard of fairness under the Due Process Clause and does\nnot extend to imposing procedures that merely displace\ncongressional choices of policy.\u201d Landon v.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s dis-\nsent, which I join, shows that the procedures prescribed by\nCongress in the Detainee Treatment Act provide the es-\nsential protections that habeas corpus guarantees; there\nhas thus been no suspension of the writ, and no basis\nexists for judicial intervention beyond what the Act allows.\nMy problem with today\u2019s opinion is more fundamental\nstill: The writ of habeas corpus does not, and never has,\nrun in favor of aliens abroad; the Suspension Clause thus\nhas no application, and the Court\u2019s intervention in this\nmilitary matter is entirely ultra vires.\n2                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  I shall devote most of what will be a lengthy opinion to\nthe legal errors contained in the opinion of the Court.\nContrary to my usual practice, however, I think it appro-\npriate to begin with a description of the disastrous conse-\nquences of what the Court has done today.\n                            I\n  America is at war with radical Islamists. The enemy\nbegan by killing Americans and American allies abroad:\n241 at the Marine barracks in Lebanon, 19 at the Khobar\nTowers in Dhahran, 224 at our embassies in Dar es Sa-\nlaam and Nairobi, and 17 on the USS Cole in Yemen. See\nNational Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the\nUnited States, The 9/11 Commission Report, pp. 60\u201361,\n70, 190 (2004). On September 11, 2001, the enemy\nbrought the battle to American soil, killing 2,749 at the\nTwin Towers in New York City, 184 at the Pentagon in\nWashington, D. C., and 40 in Pennsylvania. See id., at\n552, n. 9. It has threatened further attacks against our\nhomeland; one need only walk about buttressed and barri-\ncaded Washington, or board a plane anywhere in the\ncountry, to know that the threat is a serious one. Our\nArmed Forces are now in the field against the enemy, in\nAfghanistan and Iraq. Last week, 13 of our countrymen in\narms were killed.\n  The game of bait-and-switch that today\u2019s opinion plays\nupon the Nation\u2019s Commander in Chief will make the war\nharder on us. It will almost certainly cause more Ameri-\ncans to be killed. That consequence would be tolerable if\nnecessary to preserve a time-honored legal principle vital\nto our constitutional Republic. But it is this Court\u2019s bla-\ntant abandonment of such a principle that produces the\ndecision today. The President relied on our settled prece-\ndent in Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 (1950), when\nhe established the prison at Guantanamo Bay for enemy\naliens. Citing that case, the President\u2019s Office of Legal\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

Philbin and John C. Yoo, Deputy Assistant Attorneys\nGeneral, Office of Legal Counsel, to William J. Haynes II,\nGeneral Counsel, Dept. of Defense (Dec. 28, 2001). Had\nthe law been otherwise, the military surely would not have\ntransported prisoners there, but would have kept them in\nAfghanistan, transferred them to another of our foreign\nmilitary bases, or turned them over to allies for detention.\nThose other facilities might well have been worse for the\ndetainees themselves.\n  In the long term, then, the Court\u2019s decision today ac-\ncomplishes little, except perhaps to reduce the well-being\nof enemy combatants that the Court ostensibly seeks to\nprotect. In the short term, however, the decision is devas-\ntating. At least 30 of those prisoners hitherto released\nfrom Guantanamo Bay have returned to the battlefield.\nSee S. Rep. No. 110\u201390, pt. 7, p. 13 (2007) (Minority Views\nof Sens. Kyl, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, and Coburn)\n(hereinafter Minority Report). Some have been captured\nor killed. See ibid.; see also Mintz, Released Detainees\nRejoining the Fight, Washington Post, Oct. 22, 2004, pp.\nA1, A12. But others have succeeded in carrying on their\natrocities against innocent civilians. In one case, a de-\ntainee released from Guantanamo Bay masterminded the\nkidnapping of two Chinese dam workers, one of whom was\nlater shot to death when used as a human shield against\nPakistani commandoes. See Khan & Lancaster, Paki-\nstanis Rescue Hostage; 2nd Dies, Washington Post, Oct.\n15, 2004, p. A18. Another former detainee promptly re-\nsumed his post as a senior Taliban commander and mur-\ndered a United Nations engineer and three Afghan sol-\ndiers. Mintz, supra. Still another murdered an Afghan\njudge. See Minority Report 13. It was reported only last\n4                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmonth that a released detainee carried out a suicide bomb-\ning against Iraqi soldiers in Mosul, Iraq. See White, Ex-\nGuantanamo Detainee Joined Iraq Suicide Attack, Wash-\nington Post, May 8, 2008, p. A18.\n   These, mind you, were detainees whom the military had\nconcluded were not enemy combatants. Their return to\nthe kill illustrates the incredible difficulty of assessing\nwho is and who is not an enemy combatant in a foreign\ntheater of operations where the environment does not lend\nitself to rigorous evidence collection. Astoundingly, the\nCourt today raises the bar, requiring military officials to\nappear before civilian courts and defend their decisions\nunder procedural and evidentiary rules that go beyond\nwhat Congress has specified. As THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s\ndissent makes clear, we have no idea what those proce-\ndural and evidentiary rules are, but they will be deter-\nmined by civil courts and (in the Court\u2019s contemplation at\nleast) will be more detainee-friendly than those now ap-\nplied, since otherwise there would be no reason to hold the\ncongressionally prescribed procedures unconstitutional. If\nthey impose a higher standard of proof (from foreign bat-\ntlefields) than the current procedures require, the number\nof the enemy returned to combat will obviously increase.\n   But even when the military has evidence that it can\nbring forward, it is often foolhardy to release that evidence\nto the attorneys representing our enemies. And one esca-\nlation of procedures that the Court is clear about is afford-\ning the detainees increased access to witnesses (perhaps\ntroops serving in Afghanistan?) and to classified informa-\ntion.

See id., at 15.\n   And today it is not just the military that the Court\nelbows aside. A mere two Terms ago in Hamdan v. Rums-\nfeld, 548 U. S. 557 (2006), when the Court held (quite\namazingly) that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 had\nnot stripped habeas jurisdiction over Guantanamo peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims, four Members of today\u2019s five-Justice major-\nity joined an opinion saying the following:\n     \u201cNothing prevents the President from returning to\n     Congress to seek the authority [for trial by military\n     commission] he believes necessary.\n        \u201cWhere, as here, no emergency prevents consulta-\n     tion with Congress, judicial insistence upon that con-\n     sultation does not weaken our Nation\u2019s ability to deal\n     with danger.      To the contrary, that insistence\n     strengthens the Nation\u2019s ability to determine\u2014\n     through democratic means\u2014how best to do so. The\n     Constitution places its faith in those democratic\n     means.\u201d Id., at 636 (BREYER, J., concurring).1\nTurns out they were just kidding. For in response, Con-\ngress, at the President\u2019s request, quickly enacted the\nMilitary Commissions Act, emphatically reasserting that\nit did not want these prisoners filing habeas petitions. It\nis therefore clear that Congress and the Executive\u2014both\npolitical branches\u2014have determined that limiting the role\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Even today, the Court cannot resist striking a pose of faux deference\nto Congress and the President. Citing the above quoted passage, the\nCourt says: \u201cThe political branches, consistent with their independent\nobligations to interpret and uphold the Constitution, can engage in a\ngenuine debate about how best to preserve constitutional values while\nprotecting the Nation from terrorism.\u201d Ante, at 69. Indeed. What the\nCourt apparently means is that the political branches can debate, after\nwhich the Third Branch will decide.\n6                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nof civilian courts in adjudicating whether prisoners cap-\ntured abroad are properly detained is important to success\nin the war that some 190,000 of our men and women are\nnow fighting. As the Solicitor General argued, \u201cthe Mili-\ntary Commissions Act and the Detainee Treatment Act . . .\nrepresent an effort by the political branches to strike an\nappropriate balance between the need to preserve liberty\nand the need to accommodate the weighty and sensitive\ngovernmental interests in ensuring that those who have in\nfact fought with the enemy during a war do not return to\nbattle against the United States.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n10\u201311 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  But it does not matter. The Court today decrees that no\ngood reason to accept the judgment of the other two\nbranches is \u201capparent.\u201d Ante, at 40. \u201cThe Government,\u201d it\ndeclares, \u201cpresents no credible arguments that the mili-\ntary mission at Guantanamo would be compromised if\nhabeas corpus courts had jurisdiction to hear the detain-\nees\u2019 claims.\u201d Id., at 39. What competence does the Court\nhave to second-guess the judgment of Congress and the\nPresident on such a point? None whatever. But the Court\nblunders in nonetheless. Henceforth, as today\u2019s opinion\nmakes unnervingly clear, how to handle enemy prisoners\nin this war will ultimately lie with the branch that knows\nleast about the national security concerns that the subject\nentails.\n                            II \n\n                            A\n\n  The Suspension Clause of the Constitution provides:\n\u201cThe Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be\nsuspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion\nthe public Safety may require it.\u201d Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 2. As a\ncourt of law operating under a written Constitution, our\nrole is to determine whether there is a conflict between\nthat Clause and the Military Commissions Act. A conflict\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

See, e.g., Department of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U. S.\n715, 721 (1990); United States v. National Dairy Products\nCorp., 372 U. S. 29, 32 (1963); see also American Commu-\nnications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382, 435 (1950) (Jack-\nson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). That is\nespecially so in the area of foreign and military affairs;\n\u201cperhaps in no other area has the Court accorded Congress\ngreater deference.\u201d Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64\u2013\n65 (1981). Indeed, we accord great deference even when\nthe President acts alone in this area. See Department of\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U. S. 518, 529\u2013530 (1988); Regan v.\nWald, 468 U. S. 222, 243 (1984).\n   In light of those principles of deference, the Court\u2019s\nconclusion that \u201cthe common law [does not] yiel[d] a defi-\nnite answer to the questions before us,\u201d ante, at 22, leaves\nit no choice but to affirm the Court of Appeals. The writ\nas preserved in the Constitution could not possibly extend\nfarther than the common law provided when that Clause\nwas written. See Part III, infra. The Court admits that it\ncannot determine whether the writ historically extended\nto aliens held abroad, and it concedes (necessarily) that\nGuantanamo Bay lies outside the sovereign territory of\nthe United States. See ante, at 22\u201323; Rasul v. Bush, 542\nU. S. 466, 500\u2013501 (2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). To-\ngether, these two concessions establish that it is (in the\nCourt\u2019s view) perfectly ambiguous whether the common-\nlaw writ would have provided a remedy for these petition-\ners. If that is so, the Court has no basis to strike down the\nMilitary Commissions Act, and must leave undisturbed\n8                      BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe considered judgment of the coequal branches.2\n   How, then, does the Court weave a clear constitutional\nprohibition out of pure interpretive equipoise? The Court\nresorts to \u201cfundamental separation-of-powers principles\u201d\nto interpret the Suspension Clause. Ante, at 25. Accord-\ning to the Court, because \u201cthe writ of habeas corpus is\nitself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the\nseparation of powers,\u201d the test of its extraterritorial reach\n\u201cmust not be subject to manipulation by those whose\npower it is designed to restrain.\u201d Ante, at 36.\n   That approach distorts the nature of the separation of\npowers and its role in the constitutional structure. The\n\u201cfundamental separation-of-powers principles\u201d that the\nConstitution embodies are to be derived not from some\njudicially imagined matrix, but from the sum total of the\nindividual separation-of-powers provisions that the Con-\nstitution sets forth. Only by considering them one-by-one\ndoes the full shape of the Constitution\u2019s separation-of-\npowers principles emerge. It is nonsensical to interpret\nthose provisions themselves in light of some general\n\u201cseparation-of-powers principles\u201d dreamed up by the\nCourt. Rather, they must be interpreted to mean what\nthey were understood to mean when the people ratified\nthem. And if the understood scope of the writ of habeas\ncorpus was \u201cdesigned to restrain\u201d (as the Court says) the\nactions of the Executive, the understood limits upon that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The\n        opinion seeks to avoid this straightforward conclusion by saying\nthat the Court has been \u201ccareful not to foreclose the possibility that the\nprotections of the Suspension Clause have expanded along with post-\n1789 developments that define the present scope of the writ.\u201d Ante, at\n15\u201316 (citing INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289 300\u2013301 (2001)). But not\nforeclosing the possibility that they have expanded is not the same as\ndemonstrating (or at least holding without demonstration, which seems\nto suffice for today\u2019s majority) that they have expanded. The Court\nmust either hold that the Suspension Clause has \u201cexpanded\u201d in its\napplication to aliens abroad, or acknowledge that it has no basis to set\naside the actions of Congress and the President. It does neither.\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

As I\nwill show below, manipulation is what is afoot here. The\nunderstood limits upon the writ deny our jurisdiction over\nthe habeas petitions brought by these enemy aliens, and\nentrust the President with the crucial wartime determina-\ntions about their status and continued confinement.\n                              B\n   The Court purports to derive from our precedents a\n\u201cfunctional\u201d test for the extraterritorial reach of the writ,\nante, at 34, which shows that the Military Commissions\nAct unconstitutionally restricts the scope of habeas. That\nis remarkable because the most pertinent of those prece-\ndents, Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, conclusively\nestablishes the opposite. There we were confronted with\nthe claims of 21 Germans held at Landsberg Prison, an\nAmerican military facility located in the American Zone of\noccupation in postwar Germany. They had been captured\nin China, and an American military commission sitting\nthere had convicted them of war crimes\u2014collaborating\nwith the Japanese after Germany\u2019s surrender. Id., at 765\u2013\n766. Like the petitioners here, the Germans claimed that\ntheir detentions violated the Constitution and interna-\ntional law, and sought a writ of habeas corpus. Writing\nfor the Court, Justice Jackson held that American courts\nlacked habeas jurisdiction:\n       \u201cWe are cited to [sic] no instance where a court, in\n    this or any other country where the writ is known, has\n    issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no rele-\n    vant time and in no stage of his captivity, has been\n    within its territorial jurisdiction. Nothing in the text\n    of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does any-\n10                      BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n     thing in our statutes.\u201d Id., at 768.\n   Justice Jackson then elaborated on the historical scope\nof the writ:\n        \u201cThe alien, to whom the United States has been tra-\n     ditionally hospitable, has been accorded a generous\n     and ascending scale of rights as he increases his iden-\n     tity with our society. . . .\n        \u201cBut, in extending constitutional protections beyond\n     the citizenry, the Court has been at pains to point out\n     that it was the alien\u2019s presence within its territorial\n     jurisdiction that gave the Judiciary power to act.\u201d Id.,\n     at 770\u2013771.\n  Lest there be any doubt about the primacy of territorial\nsovereignty in determining the jurisdiction of a habeas\ncourt over an alien, Justice Jackson distinguished two\ncases in which aliens had been permitted to seek habeas\nrelief, on the ground that the prisoners in those cases were\nin custody within the sovereign territory of the United\nStates. Id., at 779\u2013780 (discussing Ex parte Quirin, 317\nU. S. 1 (1942), and In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1 (1946)).\n\u201cBy reason of our sovereignty at that time over [the Phil-\nippines],\u201d Jackson wrote, \u201cYamashita stood much as did\nQuirin before American courts.\u201d 339 U. S., at 780.\n  Eisentrager thus held\u2014held beyond any doubt\u2014that the\nConstitution does not ensure habeas for aliens held by the\nUnited States in areas over which our Government is not\nsovereign.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Inits failed attempt to distinguish Eisentrager, the Court comes up\nwith the notion that \u201cde jure sovereignty\u201d is simply an additional factor\nthat can be added to (presumably) \u201cde facto sovereignty\u201d (i.e., practical\ncontrol) to determine the availability of habeas for aliens, but that it is\nnot a necessary factor, whereas de facto sovereignty is. It is perhaps in\nthis de facto sense, the Court speculates, that Eisentrager found \u201csover-\neignty\u201d lacking. See ante, at 23\u201325. If that were so, one would have\nexpected Eisentrager to explain in some detail why the United States\n                      Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                    11\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court would have us believe that Eisentrager rested\non \u201c[p]ractical considerations,\u201d such as the \u201cdifficulties of\nordering the Government to produce the prisoners in a\nhabeas corpus proceeding.\u201d Ante, at 32. Formal sover-\neignty, says the Court, is merely one consideration \u201cthat\nbears upon which constitutional guarantees apply\u201d in a\ngiven location. Ante, at 34. This is a sheer rewriting of\nthe case. Eisentrager mentioned practical concerns, to be\nsure\u2014but not for the purpose of determining under what\ncircumstances American courts could issue writs of habeas\ncorpus for aliens abroad. It cited them to support its\nholding that the Constitution does not empower courts to\nissue writs of habeas corpus to aliens abroad in any cir-\ncumstances. As Justice Black accurately said in dissent,\n\u201cthe Court\u2019s opinion inescapably denies courts power to\nafford the least bit of protection for any alien who is sub-\nject to our occupation government abroad, even if he is\nneither enemy nor belligerent and even after peace is\nofficially declared.\u201d 339 U. S., at 796.\n   The Court also tries to change Eisentrager into a \u201cfunc-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndid not have practical control over the American zone of occupation. It\ndid not (and probably could not). Of course this novel de facto-de jure\napproach does not explain why the writ never issued to Scotland, which\nwas assuredly within the de facto control of the English crown. See\ninfra, at 22.\n  To support its holding that de facto sovereignty is relevant to the\nreach of habeas corpus, the Court cites our decision in Fleming v. Page,\n9 How. 603 (1850), a case about the application of a customs statute to\na foreign port occupied by U. S. forces. See ante, at 24. The case used\nthe phrase \u201csubject to the sovereignty and dominion of the United\nStates\u201d to refer to the United States\u2019 practical control over a \u201cforeign\ncountry.\u201d 9 How., at 614. But Fleming went on to explain that because\nthe port remained part of the \u201cenemy\u2019s country,\u201d even though under\nU. S. military occupation, \u201cits subjugation did not compel the United\nStates, while they held it, to regard it as part of their dominions, nor to\ngive to it any form of civil government, nor to extend to it our laws.\u201d\nId., at 618. If Fleming is relevant to these cases at all, it undermines\nthe Court\u2019s holding.\n12                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntional\u201d test by quoting a paragraph that lists the charac-\nteristics of the German petitioners:\n     \u201cTo support [the] assumption [of a constitutional right\n     to habeas corpus] we must hold that a prisoner of our\n     military authorities is constitutionally entitled to the\n     writ, even though he (a) is an enemy alien; (b) has\n     never been or resided in the United States; (c) was\n     captured outside of our territory and there held in\n     military custody as a prisoner of war; (d) was tried\n     and convicted by a Military Commission sitting out-\n     side the United States; (e) for offenses against laws of\n     war committed outside the United States; (f) and is at\n     all times imprisoned outside the United States.\u201d Id.,\n     at 777 (quoted in part, ante, at 36).\nBut that paragraph is introduced by a sentence stating\nthat \u201c[t]he foregoing demonstrates how much further we\nmust go if we are to invest these enemy aliens, resident,\ncaptured and imprisoned abroad, with standing to demand\naccess to our courts.\u201d 339 U. S., at 777 (emphasis added).\nHow much further than what? Further than the rule set\nforth in the prior section of the opinion, which said that \u201cin\nextending constitutional protections beyond the citizenry,\nthe Court has been at pains to point out that it was the\nalien\u2019s presence within its territorial jurisdiction that gave\nthe Judiciary power to act.\u201d Id., at 771. In other words,\nthe characteristics of the German prisoners were set forth,\nnot in application of some \u201cfunctional\u201d test, but to show\nthat the case before the Court represented an a fortiori\napplication of the ordinary rule. That is reaffirmed by the\nsentences that immediately follow the listing of the Ger-\nmans\u2019 characteristics:\n       \u201cWe have pointed out that the privilege of litigation\n     has been extended to aliens, whether friendly or en-\n     emy, only because permitting their presence in the\n     country implied protection.

See ante, at 26\u201329. It cites our statement\nin Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U. S. 298, 312 (1922), that\n\u201c \u2018the real issue in the Insular Cases was not whether the\nConstitution extended to the Philippines or Porto Rico\nwhen we went there, but which of its provisions were\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 JUSTICE SOUTER\u2019s concurrence relies on our decision four Terms ago\n\nin Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466 (2004), where the Court interpreted the\nhabeas statute to extend to aliens held at Guantanamo Bay. He thinks\nthat \u201cno one who reads the Court\u2019s opinion in Rasul could seriously\ndoubt that the jurisdictional question must be answered the same way\nin purely constitutional cases.\u201d Ante, at 1\u20132. But Rasul was devoted\nprimarily to an explanation of why Eisentrager\u2019s statutory holding no\nlonger controlled given our subsequent decision in Braden v. 30th\nJudicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484 (1973). See Rasul, supra, at\n475\u2013479. And the opinion of the Court today\u2014which JUSTICE SOUTER\njoins\u2014expressly rejects the historical evidence cited in Rasul to support\nits conclusion about the reach of habeas corpus. Compare id., at 481\u2013\n482, with ante, at 18. Moreover, even if one were to accept as true what\nJUSTICE SOUTER calls Rasul\u2019s \u201cwell-considered\u201d dictum, that does not\nexplain why Eisentrager\u2019s constitutional holding must be overruled or\nhow it can be distinguished. (After all, Rasul distinguished Eisen-\ntrager\u2019s statutory holding on a ground inapplicable to its constitutional\nholding.) In other words, even if the Court were to conclude that\nEisentrager\u2019s rule was incorrect as an original matter, the Court would\nhave to explain the justification for departing from that precedent. It\ntherefore cannot possibly be true that Rasul controls this case, as\nJUSTICE SOUTER suggests.\n14                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\napplicable by way of limitation upon the exercise of execu-\ntive and legislative power in dealing with new conditions\nand requirements.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 28. But the Court conven-\niently omits Balzac\u2019s predicate to that statement: \u201cThe\nConstitution of the United States is in force in Porto Rico\nas it is wherever and whenever the sovereign power of that\ngovernment is exerted.\u201d 258 U. S., at 312 (emphasis\nadded). The Insular Cases all concerned territories ac-\nquired by Congress under its Article IV authority and\nindisputably part of the sovereign territory of the United\nStates. See United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S.\n259, 268 (1990); Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 13 (1957)\n(plurality opinion of Black, J.). None of the Insular Cases\nstands for the proposition that aliens located outside U. S.\nsovereign territory have constitutional rights, and Eisen-\ntrager held just the opposite with respect to habeas corpus.\nAs I have said, Eisentrager distinguished Yamashita on\nthe ground of \u201cour sovereignty [over the Philippines],\u201d 339\nU. S., at 780.\n   The Court also relies on the \u201c[p]ractical considerations\u201d\nthat influenced our decision in Reid v. Covert, supra. See\nante, at 29\u201332. But all the Justices in the majority except\nJustice Frankfurter limited their analysis to the rights of\ncitizens abroad. See Reid, supra, at 5\u20136 (plurality opinion\nof Black, J.); id., at 74\u201375 (Harlan, J., concurring in re-\nsult). (Frankfurter limited his analysis to the even nar-\nrower class of civilian dependents of American military\npersonnel abroad, see id., at 45 (opinion concurring in\nresult).) In trying to wring some kind of support out of\nReid for today\u2019s novel holding, the Court resorts to a chain\nof logic that does not hold. The members of the Reid\nmajority, the Court says, were divided over whether In re\nRoss, 140 U. S. 453 (1891), which had (according to the\nCourt) held that under certain circumstances American\ncitizens abroad do not have indictment and jury-trial\nrights, should be overruled. In the Court\u2019s view, the Reid\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           15\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nplurality would have overruled Ross, but Justices Frank-\nfurter and Harlan preferred to distinguish it. The upshot:\n\u201cIf citizenship had been the only relevant factor in the\ncase, it would have been necessary for the Court to over-\nturn Ross, something Justices Harlan and Frankfurter\nwere unwilling to do.\u201d Ante, at 32. What, exactly, is this\npoint supposed to prove? To say that \u201cpractical considera-\ntions\u201d determine the precise content of the constitutional\nprotections American citizens enjoy when they are abroad\nis quite different from saying that \u201cpractical considera-\ntions\u201d determine whether aliens abroad enjoy any consti-\ntutional protections whatever, including habeas. In other\nwords, merely because citizenship is not a sufficient factor\nto extend constitutional rights abroad does not mean that\nit is not a necessary one.\n   The Court tries to reconcile Eisentrager with its holding\ntoday by pointing out that in postwar Germany, the\nUnited States was \u201canswerable to its Allies\u201d and did not\n\u201cpla[n] a long-term occupation.\u201d Ante, at 38, 39. Those\nfactors were not mentioned in Eisentrager. Worse still, it\nis impossible to see how they relate to the Court\u2019s asserted\npurpose in creating this \u201cfunctional\u201d test\u2014namely, to\nensure a judicial inquiry into detention and prevent the\npolitical branches from acting with impunity. Can it\npossibly be that the Court trusts the political branches\nmore when they are beholden to foreign powers than when\nthey act alone?\n   After transforming the a fortiori elements discussed\nabove into a \u201cfunctional\u201d test, the Court is still left with\nthe difficulty that most of those elements exist here as\nwell with regard to all the detainees. To make the appli-\ncation of the newly crafted \u201cfunctional\u201d test produce a\ndifferent result in the present cases, the Court must rely\nupon factors (d) and (e): The Germans had been tried by a\nmilitary commission for violations of the laws of war; the\npresent petitioners, by contrast, have been tried by a\n16                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCombatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) whose proce-\ndural protections, according to the Court\u2019s ipse dixit, \u201cfall\nwell short of the procedures and adversarial mechanisms\nthat would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review.\u201d\nAnte, at 37. But no one looking for \u201cfunctional\u201d equiva-\nlents would put Eisentrager and the present cases in the\nsame category, much less place the present cases in a\npreferred category. The difference between them cries out\nfor lesser procedures in the present cases. The prisoners\nin Eisentrager were prosecuted for crimes after the cessa-\ntion of hostilities; the prisoners here are enemy combat-\nants detained during an ongoing conflict. See Hamdi v.\nRumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 538 (2004) (plurality opinion)\n(suggesting, as an adequate substitute for habeas corpus,\nthe use of a tribunal akin to a CSRT to authorize the\ndetention of American citizens as enemy combatants dur-\ning the course of the present conflict).\n   The category of prisoner comparable to these detainees\nare not the Eisentrager criminal defendants, but the more\nthan 400,000 prisoners of war detained in the United\nStates alone during World War II. Not a single one was\naccorded the right to have his detention validated by a\nhabeas corpus action in federal court\u2014and that despite\nthe fact that they were present on U. S. soil. See Bradley,\nThe Military Commissions Act, Habeas Corpus, and the\nGeneva Conventions, 101 Am. J. Int\u2019l L. 322, 338 (2007).\nThe Court\u2019s analysis produces a crazy result: Whereas\nthose convicted and sentenced to death for war crimes are\nwithout judicial remedy, all enemy combatants detained\nduring a war, at least insofar as they are confined in an\narea away from the battlefield over which the United\nStates exercises \u201cabsolute and indefinite\u201d control, may\nseek a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. And, as an\neven more bizarre implication from the Court\u2019s reasoning,\nthose prisoners whom the military plans to try by full-\ndress Commission at a future date may file habeas peti-\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            17\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntions and secure release before their trials take place.\n   There is simply no support for the Court\u2019s assertion that\nconstitutional rights extend to aliens held outside U. S.\nsovereign territory, see Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S., at\n271, and Eisentrager could not be clearer that the privilege\nof habeas corpus does not extend to aliens abroad. By\nblatantly distorting Eisentrager, the Court avoids the\ndifficulty of explaining why it should be overruled. See\nPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505\nU. S. 833, 854\u2013855 (1992) (identifying stare decisis fac-\ntors). The rule that aliens abroad are not constitutionally\nentitled to habeas corpus has not proved unworkable in\npractice; if anything, it is the Court\u2019s \u201cfunctional\u201d test that\ndoes not (and never will) provide clear guidance for the\nfuture. Eisentrager forms a coherent whole with the ac-\ncepted proposition that aliens abroad have no substantive\nrights under our Constitution. Since it was announced, no\nrelevant factual premises have changed. It has engen-\ndered considerable reliance on the part of our military.\nAnd, as the Court acknowledges, text and history do not\nclearly compel a contrary ruling. It is a sad day for the\nrule of law when such an important constitutional pre-\ncedent is discarded without an apologia, much less an\napology.\n                             C\n  What drives today\u2019s decision is neither the meaning of\nthe Suspension Clause, nor the principles of our prece-\ndents, but rather an inflated notion of judicial supremacy.\nThe Court says that if the extraterritorial applicability of\nthe Suspension Clause turned on formal notions of sover-\neignty, \u201cit would be possible for the political branches to\ngovern without legal constraint\u201d in areas beyond the\nsovereign territory of the United States. Ante, at 35. That\ncannot be, the Court says, because it is the duty of this\nCourt to say what the law is. Id., at 35\u201336. It would be\n18                 BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndifficult to imagine a more question-begging analysis.\n\u201cThe very foundation of the power of the federal courts to\ndeclare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the power\nand duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies\nproperly before them.\u201d United States v. Raines, 362 U. S.\n17, 20\u201321 (1960) (citing Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch\n137 (1803); emphasis added). Our power \u201cto say what the\nlaw is\u201d is circumscribed by the limits of our statutorily and\nconstitutionally conferred jurisdiction. See Lujan v. De-\nfenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 573\u2013578 (1992). And\nthat is precisely the question in these cases: whether the\nConstitution confers habeas jurisdiction on federal courts\nto decide petitioners\u2019 claims. It is both irrational and\narrogant to say that the answer must be yes, because\notherwise we would not be supreme.\n   But so long as there are some places to which habeas\ndoes not run\u2014so long as the Court\u2019s new \u201cfunctional\u201d test\nwill not be satisfied in every case\u2014then there will be cir-\ncumstances in which \u201cit would be possible for the political\nbranches to govern without legal constraint.\u201d Or, to put it\nmore impartially, areas in which the legal determinations\nof the other branches will be (shudder!) supreme. In other\nwords, judicial supremacy is not really assured by the\nconstitutional rule that the Court creates. The gap be-\ntween rationale and rule leads me to conclude that the\nCourt\u2019s ultimate, unexpressed goal is to preserve the\npower to review the confinement of enemy prisoners held\nby the Executive anywhere in the world. The \u201cfunctional\u201d\ntest usefully evades the precedential landmine of Eisen-\ntrager but is so inherently subjective that it clears a wide\npath for the Court to traverse in the years to come.\n                             III\n   Putting aside the conclusive precedent of Eisentrager, it\nis clear that the original understanding of the Suspension\nClause was that habeas corpus was not available to aliens\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           19\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nabroad, as Judge Randolph\u2019s thorough opinion for the\ncourt below detailed. See 476 F. 3d 981, 988\u2013990 (CADC\n2007).\n   The Suspension Clause reads: \u201cThe Privilege of the Writ\nof Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in\nCases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may\nrequire it.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 2. The proper\ncourse of constitutional interpretation is to give the text\nthe meaning it was understood to have at the time of its\nadoption by the people. See, e.g., Crawford v. Washington,\n541 U. S. 36, 54 (2004). That course is especially de-\nmanded when (as here) the Constitution limits the power\nof Congress to infringe upon a pre-existing common-law\nright. The nature of the writ of habeas corpus that cannot\nbe suspended must be defined by the common-law writ\nthat was available at the time of the founding. See\nMcNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131, 135\u2013136 (1934); see also\nINS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 342 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dis-\nsenting); D\u2019Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC, 315 U. S. 447,\n471, n. 9 (1942) (Jackson, J., concurring).\n   It is entirely clear that, at English common law, the writ\nof habeas corpus did not extend beyond the sovereign\nterritory of the Crown. To be sure, the writ had an \u201cex-\ntraordinary territorial ambit,\u201d because it was a so-called\n\u201cprerogative writ,\u201d which, unlike other writs, could extend\nbeyond the realm of England to other places where the\nCrown was sovereign. R. Sharpe, The Law of Habeas\nCorpus 188 (2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter Sharpe); see also\nNote on the Power of the English Courts to Issue the Writ\nof Habeas to Places Within the Dominions of the Crown,\nBut Out of England, and On the Position of Scotland in\nRelation to that Power, 8 Jurid.

B. 1759).\n   But prerogative writs could not issue to foreign coun-\ntries, even for British subjects; they were confined to the\n20                    BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nKing\u2019s dominions\u2014those areas over which the Crown was\nsovereign. See Sharpe 188; 2 R. Chambers, A Course of\nLectures on the English Law 1767\u20131773, pp. 7\u20138 (Curley\ned. 1986); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 131 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone). Thus, the\nwrit has never extended to Scotland, which, although\nunited to England when James I succeeded to the English\nthrone in 1603, was considered a foreign dominion under a\ndifferent Crown\u2014that of the King of Scotland. Sharpe\n191; Note on Habeas 158.5 That is why Lord Mansfield\nwrote that \u201c[t]o foreign dominions, which belong to a\nprince who succeeds to the throne of England, this Court\nhas no power to send any writ of any kind. We cannot\nsend a habeas corpus to Scotland . . . .\u201d Cowle, supra, at\n856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 599\u2013600.\n  The common-law writ was codified by the Habeas Cor-\npus Act of 1679, which \u201cstood alongside Magna Charta and\nthe English Bill of Rights of 1689 as a towering common\nlaw lighthouse of liberty\u2014a beacon by which framing\nlawyers in America consciously steered their course.\u201d\nAmar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84 Geo. L. J.\n641, 663 (1996). The writ was established in the Colonies\nbeginning in the 1690\u2019s and at least one colony adopted\nthe 1679 Act almost verbatim. See Dept. of Political Sci-\nence, Okla. State Univ., Research Reports, No. 1, R.\nWalker, The American Reception of the Writ of Liberty\n12\u201316 (1961). Section XI of the Act stated where the writ\ncould run. It \u201cmay be directed and run into any county\npalatine, the cinque-ports, or other privileged places\nwithin the kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or\ntown of Berwick upon Tweed, and the islands of Jersey or\nGuernsey.\u201d 31 Car. 2, ch. 2.

The other places listed\u2014Wales,\nBerwick-upon-Tweed, Jersey, and Guernsey\u2014were terri-\ntories of the Crown even though not part England proper.\nSee Cowle, supra, at 853\u2013854, 97 Eng. Rep., at 598 (Wales\nand Berwick-upon-Tweed); 1 Blackstone 104 (Jersey and\nGuernsey); Sharpe 192 (same).\n   The Act did not extend the writ elsewhere, even though\nthe existence of other places to which British prisoners\ncould be sent was recognized by the Act. The possibility of\nevading judicial review through such spiriting-away was\neliminated, not by expanding the writ abroad, but by\nforbidding (in Article XII of the Act) the shipment of pris-\noners to places where the writ did not run or where its\nexecution would be difficult. See 31 Car. 2, ch. 2; see\ngenerally Nutting, The Most Wholesome Law\u2014The Ha-\nbeas Corpus Act of 1679, 65 Am. Hist. Rev. 527 (1960).\n   The Habeas Corpus Act, then, confirms the consensus\nview of scholars and jurists that the writ did not run\noutside the sovereign territory of the Crown. The Court\nsays that the idea that \u201cjurisdiction followed the King\u2019s\nofficers\u201d is an equally credible view. Ante, at 16. It is not\ncredible at all. The only support the Court cites for it is a\npage in Boumediene\u2019s brief, which in turn cites this\nCourt\u2019s dicta in Rasul, 542 U. S., at 482, mischaracterizing\nLord Mansfield\u2019s statement that the writ ran to any place\nthat was \u201cunder the subjection of the Crown,\u201d Cowle,\nsupra, at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 599. It is clear that Lord\nMansfield was saying that the writ extended outside the\nrealm of England proper, not outside the sovereign terri-\ntory of the Crown.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The dicta in Rasul also cited Ex parte Mwenya, [1960] 1 Q. B. 241,\n\n(C. A.), but as I explained in dissent, \u201c[e]ach judge [in Mwenya] made\n22                     BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court dismisses the example of Scotland on the\ngrounds that Scotland had its own judicial system and\nthat the writ could not, as a practical matter, have been\nenforced there. Ante, at 20. Those explanations are to-\ntally unpersuasive. The existence of a separate court\nsystem was never a basis for denying the power of a court\nto issue the writ. See 9 W. Holdsworth, A History of Eng-\nlish Law 124 (3d ed. 1944) (citing Ex parte Anderson, 3 El.\nand El. 487 (1861)). And as for logistical problems, the\nsame difficulties were present for places like the Channel\nIslands, where the writ did run. The Court attempts to\ndraw an analogy between the prudential limitations on\nissuing the writ to such remote areas within the sovereign\nterritory of the Crown and the jurisdictional prohibition on\nissuing the writ to Scotland. See ante, at 19\u201320. But the\nvery authority that the Court cites, Lord Mansfield, ex-\npressly distinguished between these two concepts, stating\nthat English courts had the \u201cpower\u201d to send the writ to\nplaces within the Crown\u2019s sovereignty, the \u201conly question\u201d\nbeing the \u201cpropriety,\u201d while they had \u201cno power to send\nany writ of any kind\u201d to Scotland and other \u201cforeign do-\nminions.\u201d Cowle, supra, at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 599\u2013600.\nThe writ did not run to Scotland because, even after the\nUnion, \u201cScotland remained a foreign dominion of the\nprince who succeeded to the English throne,\u201d and \u201cunion\ndid not extend the prerogative of the English crown to\nScotland.\u201d Sharpe 191; see also Sir Matthew Hale\u2019s The\nPrerogatives of the King 19 (D. Yale ed. 1976).7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nclear that the detainee\u2019s status as a subject was material to the resolu-\ntion of the case,\u201d 542 U. S., at 504.\n   7 The Court also argues that the fact that the writ could run to Ire-\n\nland, even though it was ruled under a \u201cseparate\u201d crown, shows that\nformal sovereignty was not the touchstone of habeas jurisdiction. Ante,\nat 21. The passage from Blackstone that the Court cites, however,\ndescribes Ireland as \u201ca dependent, subordinate kingdom\u201d that was part\nof the \u201cking\u2019s dominions.\u201d 1 Blackstone 98, 100 (internal quotation\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                   23\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   In sum, all available historical evidence points to the\nconclusion that the writ would not have been available at\ncommon law for aliens captured and held outside the\nsovereign territory of the Crown. Despite three opening\nbriefs, three reply briefs, and support from a legion of\namici, petitioners have failed to identify a single case in\nthe history of Anglo-American law that supports their\nclaim to jurisdiction. The Court finds it significant that\nthere is no recorded case denying jurisdiction to such\nprisoners either. See ante, at 21\u201322. But a case standing\nfor the remarkable proposition that the writ could issue to\na foreign land would surely have been reported, whereas a\ncase denying such a writ for lack of jurisdiction would\nlikely not. At a minimum, the absence of a reported case\neither way leaves unrefuted the voluminous commentary\nstating that habeas was confined to the dominions of the\nCrown.\n   What history teaches is confirmed by the nature of the\nlimitations that the Constitution places upon suspension\nof the common-law writ. It can be suspended only \u201cin\nCases of Rebellion or Invasion.\u201d Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 2. The latter\ncase (invasion) is plainly limited to the territory of the\nUnited States; and while it is conceivable that a rebellion\ncould be mounted by American citizens abroad, surely the\noverwhelming majority of its occurrences would be domes-\ntic. If the extraterritorial scope of habeas turned on flexi-\nble, \u201cfunctional\u201d considerations, as the Court holds, why\nwould the Constitution limit its suspension almost en-\ntirely to instances of domestic crisis? Surely there is an\neven greater justification for suspension in foreign lands\nwhere the United States might hold prisoners of war\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmarks omitted). And Lord Mansfield\u2019s opinion in Cowle plainly under-\nstood Ireland to be \u201ca dominion of the Crown of England,\u201d in contrast to\nthe \u201cforeign dominio[n]\u201d of Scotland, and thought that distinction\ndispositive of the question of habeas jurisdiction. Cowle, supra, at 856,\n97 Eng. Rep., at 599\u2013600.\n24                  BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nduring an ongoing conflict. And correspondingly, there is\nless threat to liberty when the Government suspends the\nwrit\u2019s (supposed) application in foreign lands, where even\non the most extreme view prisoners are entitled to fewer\nconstitutional rights. It makes no sense, therefore, for the\nConstitution generally to forbid suspension of the writ\nabroad if indeed the writ has application there.\n   It may be objected that the foregoing analysis proves too\nmuch, since this Court has already suggested that the writ\nof habeas corpus does run abroad for the benefit of United\nStates citizens. \u201c[T]he position that United States citizens\nthroughout the world may be entitled to habeas corpus\nrights . . . is precisely the position that this Court adopted\nin Eisentrager, see 339 U. S., at 769\u2013770, even while\nholding that aliens abroad did not have habeas corpus\nrights.\u201d Rasul, 542 U. S., at 501, 502 (SCALIA, J., dissent-\ning) (emphasis deleted). The reason for that divergence is\nnot difficult to discern. The common-law writ, as received\ninto the law of the new constitutional Republic, took on\nsuch changes as were demanded by a system in which rule\nis derived from the consent of the governed, and in which\ncitizens (not \u201csubjects\u201d) are afforded defined protections\nagainst the Government. As Justice Story wrote for the\nCourt,\n     \u201cThe common law of England is not to be taken in all\n     respects to be that of America. Our ancestors brought\n     with them its general principles, and claimed it as\n     their birthright; but they brought with them and\n     adopted only that portion which was applicable to\n     their situation.\u201d Van Ness v. Pacard, 2 Pet. 137, 144\n     (1829).\nSee also Hall, The Common Law: An Account of its Recep-\ntion in the United States, 4 Vand. L. Rev. 791 (1951). It\naccords with that principle to say, as the plurality opinion\nsaid in Reid: \u201cWhen the Government reaches out to punish\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           25\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\na citizen who is abroad, the shield which the Bill of Rights\nand other parts of the Constitution provide to protect his\nlife and liberty should not be stripped away just because\nhe happens to be in another land.\u201d 354 U. S., at 6; see also\nVerdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S., at 269\u2013270. On that analy-\nsis, \u201c[t]he distinction between citizens and aliens follows\nfrom the undoubted proposition that the Constitution does\nnot create, nor do general principles of law create, any\njuridical relation between our country and some unde-\nfined, limitless class of noncitizens who are beyond our\nterritory.\u201d Id., at 275 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   In sum, because I conclude that the text and history of\nthe Suspension Clause provide no basis for our jurisdic-\ntion, I would affirm the Court of Appeals even if Eisen-\ntrager did not govern these cases.\n                         *     *    *\n   Today the Court warps our Constitution in a way that\ngoes beyond the narrow issue of the reach of the Suspen-\nsion Clause, invoking judicially brainstormed separation-\nof-powers principles to establish a manipulable \u201cfunc-\ntional\u201d test for the extraterritorial reach of habeas corpus\n(and, no doubt, for the extraterritorial reach of other\nconstitutional protections as well). It blatantly misde-\nscribes important precedents, most conspicuously Justice\nJackson\u2019s opinion for the Court in Johnson v. Eisentrager.\nIt breaks a chain of precedent as old as the common law\nthat prohibits judicial inquiry into detentions of aliens\nabroad absent statutory authorization. And, most tragi-\ncally, it sets our military commanders the impossible task\nof proving to a civilian court, under whatever standards\nthis Court devises in the future, that evidence supports\nthe confinement of each and every enemy prisoner.\n   The Nation will live to regret what the Court has done\ntoday.

Cmdr. William C. Kuebler, Rebecca Snyder, Office of Military Commissions, Washington, D.C., for Respondent Omar Khadr.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioners are aliens designated as enemy combatants and detained at the United States Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. There are others detained there, also aliens, who are not parties to this suit.</p>\n<p>Petitioners present a question not resolved by our earlier cases relating to the detention of aliens at Guantanamo: whether they have the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus, a privilege not to be withdrawn except in conformance with the Suspension Clause, Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. We hold these petitioners do have the habeas corpus privilege. Congress has enacted a statute, the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005(DTA), 119 Stat. 2739, that provides certain procedures for review of the detainees' status. We hold that those procedures are not an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus. Therefore \u00a7 7 of the Military Commissions Act of 2006(MCA), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(e) (Supp. 2007), operates as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. We do not address whether the President has authority to detain these petitioners nor do we hold that the writ must issue. These and other questions regarding the legality of the detention are to be resolved in the first instance by the District Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), \u00a7 2(a), 115 Stat. 224, note following 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1541 (2000 ed., Supp. V), the President is authorized \"to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.\"</p>\n<p>In <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137001\"><a href=\"/opinion/137001/hamdi-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004), five Members of the Court recognized that detention of individuals who fought against the United States in Afghanistan \"for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2241</span> duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured, is so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the `necessary and appropriate force' Congress has authorized the President to use.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 518, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.), <i>id.,</i> at 588-589, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). After <i>Hamdi,</i> the Deputy Secretary of Defense established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) to determine whether individuals detained at Guantanamo were \"enemy combatants,\" as the Department defines that term. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1195, p. 81a. A later memorandum established procedures to implement the CSRTs. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, p. 147. The Government maintains these procedures were designed to comply with the due process requirements identified by the plurality in <i>Hamdi.</i> See Brief for Respondents 10.</p>\n<p>Interpreting the AUMF, the Department of Defense ordered the detention of these petitioners, and they were transferred to Guantanamo. Some of these individuals were apprehended on the battlefield in Afghanistan, others in places as far away from there as Bosnia and Gambia. All are foreign nationals, but none is a citizen of a nation now at war with the United States. Each denies he is a member of the al Qaeda terrorist network that carried out the September 11 attacks or of the Taliban regime that provided sanctuary for al Qaeda. Each petitioner appeared before a separate CSRT; was determined to be an enemy combatant; and has sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p>The first actions commenced in February 2002. The District Court ordered the cases dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the naval station is outside the sovereign territory of the United States. See <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> 215 F.Supp.2d 55 (2002). The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. See <i>Al Odah v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1134</span></span>, 1145 (2003). We granted certiorari and reversed, holding that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 extended statutory habeas corpus jurisdiction to Guantanamo. See <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137000\"><a href=\"/opinion/137000/rasul-v-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 473, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004). The constitutional issue presented in the instant cases was not reached in <i>Rasul. Id.,</i> at 476, 124 S.Ct. 2686.</p>\n<p>After <i>Rasul,</i> petitioners' cases were consolidated and entertained in two separate proceedings. In the first set of cases, Judge Richard J. Leon granted the Government's motion to dismiss, holding that the detainees had no rights that could be vindicated in a habeas corpus action. In the second set of cases Judge Joyce Hens Green reached the opposite conclusion, holding the detainees had rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See <i>Khalid v. Bush,</i> 355 F.Supp.2d 311, 314 (DDC 2005); <i>In re Guantanamo Detainee Cases,</i> 355 F.Supp.2d 443, 464 (DDC 2005).</p>\n<p>While appeals were pending from the District Court decisions, Congress passed the DTA. Subsection (e) of \u00a7 1005 of the DTA amended 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 to provide that \"no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider ... an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\" 119 Stat. 2742. Section 1005 further provides that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit shall have \"exclusive\" jurisdiction to review decisions of the CSRTs. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145625\"><a href=\"/opinion/145625/hamdan-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span>, 576-577, 126 S.Ct. 2749, 165 L.Ed.2d 723 (2006), the Court held this provision did <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2242</span> not apply to cases (like petitioners') pending when the DTA was enacted. Congress responded by passing the MCA, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 948a <i>et seq.</i> (Supp.2007), which again amended \u00a7 2241. The text of the statutory amendment is discussed below. See Part II, <i>infra.</i> (Four Members of the <i>Hamdan</i> majority noted that \"[n]othing prevent[ed] the President from returning to Congress to seek the authority he believes necessary.\" 548 U.S., at 636, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (BREYER, J., concurring). The authority to which the concurring opinion referred was the authority to \"create military commissions of the kind at issue\" in the case. <i>Ibid.</i> Nothing in that opinion can be construed as an invitation for Congress to suspend the writ.)</p>\n<p>Petitioners' cases were consolidated on appeal, and the parties filed supplemental briefs in light of our decision in <i>Hamdan.</i> The Court of Appeals' ruling, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186848\"><a href=\"/opinion/186848/boumediene-lakhdar-v-bush-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">981</span></a></span> (C.A.D.C.2007), is the subject of our present review and today's decision.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals concluded that MCA \u00a7 7 must be read to strip from it, and all federal courts, jurisdiction to consider petitioners' habeas corpus applications, <i>id.,</i> at 987; that petitioners are not entitled to the privilege of the writ or the protections of the Suspension Clause, <i>id.,</i> at 990-991; and, as a result, that it was unnecessary to consider whether Congress provided an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus in the DTA.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari. 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 3067, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>As a threshold matter, we must decide whether MCA \u00a7 7 denies the federal courts jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus actions pending at the time of its enactment. We hold the statute does deny that jurisdiction, so that, if the statute is valid, petitioners' cases must be dismissed.</p>\n<p>As amended by the terms of the MCA, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(e) (Supp.2007) now provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the United States who has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Except as provided in [\u00a7\u00a7 1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) of the DTA] no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any other action against the United States or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement of an alien who is or was detained by the United States and has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Section 7(b) of the MCA provides the effective date for the amendment of \u00a7 2241(e). It states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The amendment made by [MCA \u00a7 7(a)] shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply to all cases, without exception, pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act which relate to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of detention of an alien detained by the United States since September 11, 2001.\" 120 Stat. 2636.</blockquote>\n<p>There is little doubt that the effective date provision applies to habeas corpus actions. Those actions, by definition, are cases \"which relate to ... detention.\" See Black's Law Dictionary 728 (8th ed.2004) (defining habeas corpus as \"[a] writ employed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2243</span> to bring a person before a court, most frequently to ensure that the party's imprisonment or detention is not illegal\"). Petitioners argue, nevertheless, that MCA \u00a7 7(b) is not a sufficiently clear statement of congressional intent to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction in pending cases. See <i>Ex parte Yerger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88072\"><a href=\"/opinion/88072/ex-parte-yerger/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 102-103, 19 L.Ed. 332 (1869). We disagree.</p>\n<p>Their argument is as follows: Section 2241(e)(1) refers to \"a writ of habeas corpus.\" The next paragraph, \u00a7 2241(e)(2), refers to \"any other action ... relating to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement of an alien who ... [has] been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.\" There are two separate paragraphs, the argument continues, so there must be two distinct classes of cases. And the effective date subsection, MCA \u00a7 7(b), it is said, refers only to the second class of cases, for it largely repeats the language of \u00a7 2241(e)(2) by referring to \"cases ... which relate to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of detention of an alien detained by the United States.\"</p>\n<p>Petitioners' textual argument would have more force were it not for the phrase \"other action\" in \u00a7 2241(e)(2). The phrase cannot be understood without referring back to the paragraph that precedes it, \u00a7 2241(e)(1), which explicitly mentions the term \"writ of habeas corpus.\" The structure of the two paragraphs implies that habeas actions are a type of action \"relating to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement of an alien who is or was detained... as an enemy combatant.\" Pending habeas actions, then, are in the category of cases subject to the statute's jurisdictional bar.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge, moreover, the litigation history that prompted Congress to enact the MCA. In <i>Hamdan</i> the Court found it unnecessary to address the petitioner's Suspension Clause arguments but noted the relevance of the clear statement rule in deciding whether Congress intended to reach pending habeas corpus cases. See 548 U.S., at 575, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (Congress should \"not be presumed to have effected such denial [of habeas relief] absent an unmistakably clear statement to the contrary\"). This interpretive rule facilitates a dialogue between Congress and the Court. Cf. <i>Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112669\"><a href=\"/opinion/112669/hilton-v-south-carolina-public-railways-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 206, 112 S.Ct. 560, 116 L.Ed.2d 560 (1991); H. Hart &amp; A. Sacks, The Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law 1209-1210 (W. Eskridge &amp; P. Frickey eds.1994). If the Court invokes a clear statement rule to advise that certain statutory interpretations are favored in order to avoid constitutional difficulties, Congress can make an informed legislative choice either to amend the statute or to retain its existing text. If Congress amends, its intent must be respected even if a difficult constitutional question is presented. The usual presumption is that Members of Congress, in accord with their oath of office, considered the constitutional issue and determined the amended statute to be a lawful one; and the Judiciary, in light of that determination, proceeds to its own independent judgment on the constitutional question when required to do so in a proper case.</p>\n<p>If this ongoing dialogue between and among the branches of Government is to be respected, we cannot ignore that the MCA was a direct response to <i>Hamdan</i>'s holding that the DTA's jurisdiction-stripping provision had no application to pending cases. The Court of Appeals was correct to take note of the legislative history when construing the statute, see 476 F.3d, at 986, n. 2 (citing relevant floor statements); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2244</span> and we agree with its conclusion that the MCA deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain the habeas corpus actions now before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In deciding the constitutional questions now presented we must determine whether petitioners are barred from seeking the writ or invoking the protections of the Suspension Clause either because of their status, <i>i.e.,</i> petitioners' designation by the Executive Branch as enemy combatants, or their physical location, <i>i.e.,</i> their presence at Guantanamo Bay. The Government contends that noncitizens designated as enemy combatants and detained in territory located outside our Nation's borders have no constitutional rights and no privilege of habeas corpus. Petitioners contend they do have cognizable constitutional rights and that Congress, in seeking to eliminate recourse to habeas corpus as a means to assert those rights, acted in violation of the Suspension Clause.</p>\n<p>We begin with a brief account of the history and origins of the writ. Our account proceeds from two propositions. First, protection for the privilege of habeas corpus was one of the few safeguards of liberty specified in a Constitution that, at the outset, had no Bill of Rights. In the system conceived by the Framers the writ had a centrality that must inform proper interpretation of the Suspension Clause. Second, to the extent there were settled precedents or legal commentaries in 1789 regarding the extraterritorial scope of the writ or its application to enemy aliens, those authorities can be instructive for the present cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Framers viewed freedom from unlawful restraint as a fundamental precept of liberty, and they understood the writ of habeas corpus as a vital instrument to secure that freedom. Experience taught, however, that the common-law writ all too often had been insufficient to guard against the abuse of monarchial power. That history counseled the necessity for specific language in the Constitution to secure the writ and ensure its place in our legal system.</p>\n<p>Magna Carta decreed that no man would be imprisoned contrary to the law of the land. Art. 39, in Sources of Our Liberties 17 (R. Perry &amp; J. Cooper eds. 1959) (\"No free man shall be taken or imprisoned or dispossessed, or outlawed, or banished, or in any way destroyed, nor will we go upon him, nor send upon him, except by the legal judgment of his peers or by the law of the land\"). Important as the principle was, the Barons at Runnymede prescribed no specific legal process to enforce it. Holdsworth tells us, however, that gradually the writ of habeas corpus became the means by which the promise of Magna Carta was fulfilled. 9 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 112 (1926) (hereinafter Holdsworth).</p>\n<p>The development was painstaking, even by the centuries-long measures of English constitutional history. The writ was known and used in some form at least as early as the reign of Edward I. <i>Id.,</i> at 108-125. Yet at the outset it was used to protect not the rights of citizens but those of the King and his courts. The early courts were considered agents of the Crown, designed to assist the King in the exercise of his power. See J. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History 38-39 (4th ed.2002). Thus the writ, while it would become part of the foundation of liberty for the King's subjects, was in its earliest use a mechanism for securing compliance with the King's laws. See Halliday &amp; White, The Suspension Clause: English Text, Imperial Contexts, and American <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2245</span> Implications, 94 Va. L.Rev. (forthcoming 2008) (hereinafter Halliday &amp; White) (manuscript, at 11, online at http://papers. ssrn.com/sol3 /papers.cfm?abstract_id=1008252 (all Internet materials as visited June 9, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (noting that \"conceptually the writ arose from a theory of power rather than a theory of liberty\")). Over time it became clear that by issuing the writ of habeas corpus common-law courts sought to enforce the King's prerogative to inquire into the authority of a jailer to hold a prisoner. See M. Hale, Prerogatives of the King 229 (D. Yale ed.1976); 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 1341, p. 237 (3d ed. 1858) (noting that the writ ran \"into all parts of the king's dominions; for it is said, that the king is entitled, at all times, to have an account, why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained\").</p>\n<p>Even so, from an early date it was understood that the King, too, was subject to the law. As the writers said of Magna Carta, \"it means this, that the king is and shall be below the law.\" 1 F. Pollock &amp; F. Maitland, History of English Law 173 (2d ed.1909); see also 2 Bracton On the Laws and Customs of England 33 (S. Thorne transl. 1968) (\"The king must not be under man but under God and under the law, because law makes the king\"). And, by the 1600's, the writ was deemed less an instrument of the King's power and more a restraint upon it. See Collings, Habeas Corpus for Convicts\u0097Constitutional Right or Legislative Grace, 40 Calif. L.Rev. 335, 336 (1952) (noting that by this point the writ was \"the appropriate process for checking illegal imprisonment by public officials\").</p>\n<p>Still, the writ proved to be an imperfect check. Even when the importance of the writ was well understood in England, habeas relief often was denied by the courts or suspended by Parliament. Denial or suspension occurred in times of political unrest, to the anguish of the imprisoned and the outrage of those in sympathy with them.</p>\n<p>A notable example from this period was <i>Darnel's Case,</i> 3 How. St. Tr. 1 (K.B.1627). The events giving rise to the case began when, in a display of the Stuart penchant for authoritarian excess, Charles I demanded that Darnel and at least four others lend him money. Upon their refusal, they were imprisoned. The prisoners sought a writ of habeas corpus; and the King filed a return in the form of a warrant signed by the Attorney General. <i>Ibid.</i> The court held this was a sufficient answer and justified the subjects' continued imprisonment. <i>Id.,</i> at 59.</p>\n<p>There was an immediate outcry of protest. The House of Commons promptly passed the Petition of Right, 3 Car. 1, ch. 1 (1627), 5 Statutes of the Realm 23, 24 (reprint 1963), which condemned executive \"imprison[ment] without any cause\" shown, and declared that \"no freeman in any such manner as is before mencioned [shall] be imprisoned or deteined.\" Yet a full legislative response was long delayed. The King soon began to abuse his authority again, and Parliament was dissolved. See W. Hall &amp; R. Albion, A History of England and the British Empire 328 (3d ed.1953) (hereinafter Hall &amp; Albion). When Parliament reconvened in 1640, it sought to secure access to the writ by statute. The Act of 1640, 16 Car. 1, ch. 10, 5 Statutes of the Realm, at 110, expressly authorized use of the writ to test the legality of commitment by command or warrant of the King or the Privy Council. Civil strife and the Interregnum soon followed, and not until 1679 did Parliament try once more to secure the writ, this time through the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 31 Car. 2, ch. 2, <i>id.,</i> at 935. The Act, which later <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2246</span> would be described by Blackstone as the \"stable bulwark of our liberties,\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *137 (hereinafter Blackstone), established procedures for issuing the writ; and it was the model upon which the habeas statutes of the 13 American Colonies were based, see Collings, <i>supra,</i> at 338-339.</p>\n<p>This history was known to the Framers. It no doubt confirmed their view that pendular swings to and away from individual liberty were endemic to undivided, uncontrolled power. The Framers' inherent distrust of governmental power was the driving force behind the constitutional plan that allocated powers among three independent branches. This design serves not only to make Government accountable but also to secure individual liberty. See <i>Loving v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118033\"><a href=\"/opinion/118033/loving-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span>, 756, 116 S.Ct. 1737, 135 L.Ed.2d 36 (1996) (noting that \"[e]ven before the birth of this country, separation of powers was known to be a defense against tyranny\"); cf. <i>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v.

Because the Constitution's separation-of-powers structure, like the substantive guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, see <i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, 374, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886), protects persons as well as citizens, foreign nationals who have the privilege of litigating in our courts can seek to enforce separation-of-powers principles, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>INS v. Chadha,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110985\"><a href=\"/opinion/110985/ins-v-chadha/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></a></span>, 958-959, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983).</p>\n<p>That the Framers considered the writ a vital instrument for the protection of individual liberty is evident from the care taken to specify the limited grounds for its suspension: \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2; see Amar, Of Sovereignty and Federalism, 96 Yale L.J. 1425, 1509, n. 329 (1987) (\"[T]he non-suspension clause is the original Constitution's most explicit reference to remedies\"). The word \"privilege\" was used, perhaps, to avoid mentioning some rights to the exclusion of others. (Indeed, the only mention of the term \"right\" in the Constitution, as ratified, is in its clause giving Congress the power to protect the rights of authors and inventors. See Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8.)</p>\n<p>Surviving accounts of the ratification debates provide additional evidence that the Framers deemed the writ to be an essential mechanism in the separation-of-powers scheme. In a critical exchange with Patrick Henry at the Virginia ratifying convention Edmund Randolph referred to the Suspension Clause as an \"exception\" to the \"power given to Congress to regulate courts.\" See 3 Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 460-464 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876) (hereinafter Elliot's Debates). A resolution passed by the New York ratifying convention made clear its understanding that the Clause not only protects against arbitrary suspensions of the writ but also guarantees an affirmative right to judicial inquiry into the causes of detention. See Resolution of the New York Ratifying Convention (July 26, 1788), in 1 Elliot's Debates 328 (noting the convention's understanding \"[t]hat every person restrained of his liberty is entitled to an inquiry into the lawfulness of such restraint, and to a removal thereof if unlawful; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2247</span> and that such inquiry or removal ought not to be denied or delayed, except when, on account of public danger, the Congress shall suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>\"). Alexander Hamilton likewise explained that by providing the detainee a judicial forum to challenge detention, the writ preserves limited government. As he explained in The Federalist No. 84:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny. The observations of the judicious Blackstone ... are well worthy of recital: `To bereave a man of life ... or by violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a <i>more dangerous engine</i> of arbitrary government.' And as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the <i>habeas corpus</i> act, which in one place he calls `the BULWARK of the British Constitution.'\" C. Rossiter ed., p. 512 (1961) (quoting 1 Blackstone *136, 4 <i>id.,</i> at *438).</blockquote>\n<p>Post-1789 habeas developments in England, though not bearing upon the Framers' intent, do verify their foresight. Those later events would underscore the need for structural barriers against arbitrary suspensions of the writ. Just as the writ had been vulnerable to executive and parliamentary encroachment on both sides of the Atlantic before the American Revolution, despite the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, the writ was suspended with frequency in England during times of political unrest after 1789. Parliament suspended the writ for much of the period from 1792 to 1801, resulting in rampant arbitrary imprisonment. See Hall &amp; Albion 550. Even as late as World War I, at least one prominent English jurist complained that the Defence of the Realm Act, 1914, 4 &amp; 5 Geo. 5, ch. 29(1)(a), effectively had suspended the privilege of habeas corpus for any person suspected of \"communicating with the enemy.\" See <i>King v. Halliday,</i> [1917] A.C. 260, 299 (Lord Shaw, dissenting); see generally A. Simpson, In the Highest Degree Odious: Detention Without Trial in Wartime Britain 6-7, 24-25 (1992).</p>\n<p>In our own system the Suspension Clause is designed to protect against these cyclical abuses. The Clause protects the rights of the detained by a means consistent with the essential design of the Constitution. It ensures that, except during periods of formal suspension, the Judiciary will have a time-tested device, the writ, to maintain the \"delicate balance of governance\" that is itself the surest safeguard of liberty. See <i>Hamdi,</i> 542 U.S., at 536, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (plurality opinion). The Clause protects the rights of the detained by affirming the duty and authority of the Judiciary to call the jailer to account. See <i>Preiser v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108772\"><a href=\"/opinion/108772/preiser-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, 484, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (\"[T]he essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of that custody\"); cf. <i>In re Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></span>, 439-440 (1867) (Cooley, J., concurring) (\"The important fact to be observed in regard to the mode of procedure upon this [habeas] writ is, that it is directed to, and served upon, not the person confined, but his jailer\"). The separation-of-powers doctrine, and the history that influenced its design, therefore must inform the reach and purpose of the Suspension Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2248</span> B</h2>\n<p>The broad historical narrative of the writ and its function is central to our analysis, but we seek guidance as well from founding-era authorities addressing the specific question before us: whether foreign nationals, apprehended and detained in distant countries during a time of serious threats to our Nation's security, may assert the privilege of the writ and seek its protection. The Court has been careful not to foreclose the possibility that the protections of the Suspension Clause have expanded along with post-1789 developments that define the present scope of the writ. See <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span>, 300-301, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). But the analysis may begin with precedents as of 1789, for the Court has said that \"at the absolute minimum\" the Clause protects the writ as it existed when the Constitution was drafted and ratified. <i>Id.,</i> at 301, 121 S.Ct. 2271.</p>\n<p>To support their arguments, the parties in these cases have examined historical sources to construct a view of the commonlaw writ as it existed in 1789\u0097as have <i>amici</i> whose expertise in legal history the Court has relied upon in the past. See Brief for Legal Historians as <i>Amici Curiae;</i> see also <i>St. Cyr, supra,</i> at 302, n. 16, 121 S.Ct. 2271. The Government argues the common-law writ ran only to those territories over which the Crown was sovereign. See Brief for Respondents 27. Petitioners argue that jurisdiction followed the King's officers. See Brief for Petitioner Boumediene et al. 11. Diligent search by all parties reveals no certain conclusions. In none of the cases cited do we find that a common-law court would or would not have granted, or refused to hear for lack of jurisdiction, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought by a prisoner deemed an enemy combatant, under a standard like the one the Department of Defense has used in these cases, and when held in a territory, like Guantanamo, over which the Government has total military and civil control.</p>\n<p>We know that at common law a petitioner's status as an alien was not a categorical bar to habeas corpus relief. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Sommersett's Case,</i> 20 How. St. Tr. 1, 80-82 (1772) (ordering an African slave freed upon finding the custodian's return insufficient); see generally <i>Khera v. Secretary of State for the Home Dept.,</i> [1984] A.C. 74, 111 (\"Habeas corpus protection is often expressed as limited to `British subjects.' Is it really limited to British nationals? Suffice it to say that the case law has given an emphatic `no' to the question\"). We know as well that common-law courts entertained habeas petitions brought by enemy aliens detained in England\u0097\"entertained\" at least in the sense that the courts held hearings to determine the threshold question of entitlement to the writ. See <i>Case of Three Spanish Sailors,</i> 2 Black. W. 1324, 96 Eng. Rep. 775 (C.P. 1779); <i>King v. Schiever,</i> 2 Burr. 765, 97 Eng. Rep. 551 (K.B.1759); <i>Du Castro's Case,</i> Fort. 195, 92 Eng. Rep. 816 (K.B.1697).</p>\n<p>In <i>Schiever</i> and the <i>Spanish Sailors</i>' case, the courts denied relief to the petitioners. Whether the holdings in these cases were jurisdictional or based upon the courts' ruling that the petitioners were detained lawfully as prisoners of war is unclear. See <i>Spanish Sailors, supra,</i> at 1324, 96 Eng. Rep., at 776; <i>Schiever, supra,</i> at 766, 97 Eng. Rep., at 552. In <i>Du Castro</i>'s <i>Case,</i> the court granted relief, but that case is not analogous to petitioners' because the prisoner there appears to have been detained in England. See Halliday &amp; White 27, n. 72. To the extent these authorities suggest the common-law courts abstained altogether from matters involving prisoners of war, there was greater justification for doing so in the context of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2249</span> declared wars with other nation states. Judicial intervention might have complicated the military's ability to negotiate exchange of prisoners with the enemy, a wartime practice well known to the Framers. See Resolution of Mar. 30, 1778, 10 Journals of the Continental Congress 1774-1789, p. 295 (W. Ford ed.1908) (directing General Washington not to exchange prisoners with the British unless the enemy agreed to exempt citizens from capture).</p>\n<p>We find the evidence as to the geographic scope of the writ at common law informative, but, again, not dispositive. Petitioners argue the site of their detention is analogous to two territories outside of England to which the writ did run: the so-called \"exempt jurisdictions,\" like the Channel Islands; and (in former times) India. There are critical differences between these places and Guantanamo, however.</p>\n<p>As the Court noted in <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 481-482, and nn. 11-12, 124 S.Ct. 2686, common-law courts granted habeas corpus relief to prisoners detained in the exempt jurisdictions. But these areas, while not in theory part of the realm of England, were nonetheless under the Crown's control. See 2 H. Hallam, Constitutional History of England: From the Accession of Henry VII to the Death of George II, pp. 232-233 (reprint 1989). And there is some indication that these jurisdictions were considered sovereign territory. <i>King v. Cowle,</i> 2 Burr. 834, 854, 855, 97 Eng. Rep. 587, 599 (K.B.1759) (describing one of the exempt jurisdictions, Berwick-upon-Tweed, as under the \"sovereign jurisdiction\" and \"subjection of the Crown of England\"). Because the United States does not maintain formal sovereignty over Guantanamo Bay, see Part IV, <i>infra,</i> the naval station there and the exempt jurisdictions discussed in the English authorities are not similarly situated.</p>\n<p>Petitioners and their <i>amici</i> further rely on cases in which British courts in India granted writs of habeas corpus to noncitizens detained in territory over which the Moghul Emperor retained formal sovereignty and control. See <i>supra,</i> at 2246-2248; Brief for Legal Historians as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 12-13. The analogy to the present cases breaks down, however, because of the geographic location of the courts in the Indian example. The Supreme Court of Judicature (the British Court) sat in Calcutta; but no federal court sits at Guantanamo. The Supreme Court of Judicature was, moreover, a special court set up by Parliament to monitor certain conduct during the British Raj. See Regulating Act of 1773, 13 Geo. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 13-14. That it had the power to issue the writ in nonsovereign territory does not prove that common-law courts sitting in England had the same power. If petitioners were to have the better of the argument on this point, we would need some demonstration of a consistent practice of common-law courts sitting in England and entertaining petitions brought by alien prisoners detained abroad. We find little support for this conclusion.</p>\n<p>The Government argues, in turn, that Guantanamo is more closely analogous to Scotland and Hanover, territories that were not part of England but nonetheless controlled by the English monarch (in his separate capacities as King of Scotland and Elector of Hanover). See <i>Cowle,</i> 2 Burr., at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 600. Lord Mansfield can be cited for the proposition that, at the time of the founding, English courts lacked the \"power\" to issue the writ to Scotland and Hanover, territories Lord Mansfield referred to as \"foreign.\" <i>Ibid.</i> But what matters for our purposes is why common-law courts lacked this power. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2250</span> Given the English Crown's delicate and complicated relationships with Scotland and Hanover in the 1700's, we cannot disregard the possibility that the common-law courts' refusal to issue the writ to these places was motivated not by formal legal constructs but by what we would think of as prudential concerns. This appears to have been the case with regard to other British territories where the writ did not run. See 2 R. Chambers, A Course of Lectures on English Law 1767-1773, p. 8 (T. Curley ed.1986) (quoting the view of Lord Mansfield in <i>Cowle</i> that \"[n]otwithstanding the <i>power</i> which the judges have, yet where they cannot judge of the cause, or give relief upon it, they would not think <i>proper</i> to interpose; and therefore in the case of imprisonments in <i>Guernsey, Jersey, Minorca,</i> or the <i>plantations,</i> the most usual way is to complain to the <i>king in Council</i>\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). And after the Act of Union in 1707, through which the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged politically, Queen Anne and her successors, in their new capacity as sovereign of Great Britain, ruled the entire island as one kingdom. Accordingly, by the time Lord Mansfield penned his opinion in <i>Cowle</i> in 1759, Scotland was no longer a \"foreign\" country vis-\u00e1-vis England\u0097at least not in the sense in which Cuba is a foreign country vis-\u00e1-vis the United States.</p>\n<p>Scotland remained \"foreign\" in Lord Mansfield's day in at least one important respect, however. Even after the Act of Union, Scotland (like Hanover) continued to maintain its own laws and court system. See 1 Blackstone *98, *109. Under these circumstances prudential considerations would have weighed heavily when courts sitting in England received habeas petitions from Scotland or the Electorate. Common-law decisions withholding the writ from prisoners detained in these places easily could be explained as efforts to avoid either or both of two embarrassments: conflict with the judgments of another court of competent jurisdiction; or the practical inability, by reason of distance, of the English courts to enforce their judgments outside their territorial jurisdiction. Cf. <i>Munaf v. Geren,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2207, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2369260</span></span> *13-14 (opinion of the Court) (recognizing that \"`prudential concerns' ... such as comity and the orderly administration of criminal justice\" affect the appropriate exercise of habeas jurisdiction).</p>\n<p>By the mid-19th century, British courts could issue the writ to Canada, notwithstanding the fact that Canadian courts also had the power to do so. See 9 Holdsworth 124 (citing <i>Ex parte Anderson,</i> 3 El. and El. 487 (1861)). This might be seen as evidence that the existence of a separate court system was no barrier to the running of the common-law writ. The Canada of the 1800's, however, was in many respects more analogous to the exempt jurisdictions or to Ireland, where the writ ran, than to Scotland or Hanover in the 1700's, where it did not. Unlike Scotland and Hanover, Canada followed English law. See B. Laskin, The British Tradition in Canadian Law 50-51 (1969).</p>\n<p>In the end a categorical or formal conception of sovereignty does not provide a comprehensive or altogether satisfactory explanation for the general understanding that prevailed when Lord Mansfield considered issuance of the writ outside England. In 1759 the writ did not run to Scotland but did run to Ireland, even though, at that point, Scotland and England had merged under the rule of a single sovereign, whereas the Crowns of Great Britain and Ireland remained separate (at least in theory). See <i>Cowle, supra,</i> at 856-857, 97 Eng. Rep., 600; 1 Blackstone *100-101. But there was at least one major <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2251</span> difference between Scotland's and Ireland's relationship with England during this period that might explain why the writ ran to Ireland but not to Scotland. English law did not generally apply in Scotland (even after the Act of Union) but it did apply in Ireland. Blackstone put it as follows: \"[A]s Scotland and England are now one and the same kingdom, and yet differ in their municipal laws; so England and Ireland are, on the other hand, distinct kingdoms, and yet in general agree in their laws.\" <i>Id.,</i> at *100. This distinction, and not formal notions of sovereignty, may well explain why the writ did not run to Scotland (and Hanover) but would run to Ireland.</p>\n<p>The prudential barriers that may have prevented the English courts from issuing the writ to Scotland and Hanover are not relevant here. We have no reason to believe an order from a federal court would be disobeyed at Guantanamo. No Cuban court has jurisdiction to hear these petitioners' claims, and no law other than the laws of the United States applies at the naval station. The modern-day relations between the United States and Guantanamo thus differ in important respects from the 18th-century relations between England and the kingdoms of Scotland and Hanover. This is reason enough for us to discount the relevance of the Government's analogy.</p>\n<p>Each side in the present matter argues that the very lack of a precedent on point supports its position. The Government points out there is no evidence that a court sitting in England granted habeas relief to an enemy alien detained abroad; petitioners respond there is no evidence that a court refused to do so for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Both arguments are premised, however, upon the assumption that the historical record is complete and that the common law, if properly understood, yields a definite answer to the questions before us. There are reasons to doubt both assumptions. Recent scholarship points to the inherent shortcomings in the historical record. See Halliday &amp; White 14-15 (noting that most reports of 18th-century habeas proceedings were not printed). And given the unique status of Guantanamo Bay and the particular dangers of terrorism in the modern age, the common-law courts simply may not have confronted cases with close parallels to this one. We decline, therefore, to infer too much, one way or the other, from the lack of historical evidence on point. Cf. <i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 489, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (noting evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, discussed in the parties' briefs and uncovered through the Court's own investigation, \"convince us that, although these sources cast some light, it is not enough to resolve the problem with which we are faced.

See DTA \u00a7 1005(g), 119 Stat. 2743. And under the terms of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2252</span> the lease between the United States and Cuba, Cuba retains \"ultimate sovereignty\" over the territory while the United States exercises \"complete jurisdiction and control.\" See Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval Stations, Feb. 23, 1903, U.S.-Cuba, Art. III, T.S. No. 418 (hereinafter 1903 Lease Agreement); <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 471, 124 S.Ct. 2686. Under the terms of the 1934 Treaty, however, Cuba effectively has no rights as a sovereign until the parties agree to modification of the 1903 Lease Agreement or the United States abandons the base. See Treaty Defining Relations with Cuba, May 29, 1934, U.S.-Cuba, Art. III, 48 Stat. 1683, T.S. No. 866.</p>\n<p>The United States contends, nevertheless, that Guantanamo is not within its sovereign control. This was the Government's position well before the events of September 11, 2001. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Petitioners in <i>Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc.,</i> O.T.1992, No. 92-344, p. 31 (arguing that Guantanamo is territory \"<i>outside</i> the United States\"). And in other contexts the Court has held that questions of sovereignty are for the political branches to decide. See <i>Vermilya-Brown Co. v. Connell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104602\"><a href=\"/opinion/104602/vermilya-brown-co-v-connell/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span>, 380, 69 S.Ct. 140, 93 L.Ed. 76 (1948) (\"[D]etermination of sovereignty over an area is for the legislative and executive departments\"); see also <i>Jones v.

Even if this were a treaty interpretation case that did not involve a political question, the President's construction of the lease agreement would be entitled to great respect. See <i>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110740\"><a href=\"/opinion/110740/sumitomo-shoji-america-inc-v-avagliano/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span>, 184-185, 102 S.Ct. 2374, 72 L.Ed.2d 765 (1982).</p>\n<p>We therefore do not question the Government's position that Cuba, not the United States, maintains sovereignty, in the legal and technical sense of the term, over Guantanamo Bay. But this does not end the analysis. Our cases do not hold it is improper for us to inquire into the objective degree of control the Nation asserts over foreign territory. As commentators have noted, \"`[s]overeignty' is a term used in many senses and is much abused.\" See 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 206, Comment <i>b,</i> p. 94 (1986). When we have stated that sovereignty is a political question, we have referred not to sovereignty in the general, colloquial sense, meaning the exercise of dominion or power, see Webster's New International Dictionary 2406 (2d ed.1934) (\"sovereignty,\" definition 3), but sovereignty in the narrow, legal sense of the term, meaning a claim of right, see 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 206, Comment <i>b,</i> at 94 (noting that sovereignty \"implies a state's lawful control over its territory generally to the exclusion of other states, authority to govern in that territory, and authority to apply law there\"). Indeed, it is not altogether uncommon for a territory to be under the <i>de jure</i> sovereignty of one nation, while under the plenary control, or practical sovereignty, of another. This condition can occur when the territory is seized during war, as Guantanamo was during the Spanish-American War. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Fleming v. Page,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86587\"><a href=\"/opinion/86587/fleming-v-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 614, 13 L.Ed. 276 (1850) (noting that the port of Tampico, conquered by the United States during the war with Mexico, was \"undoubtedly ... subject to the sovereignty and dominion of the United States,\" but that it \"does not follow that it was a part of the United States, or that it ceased to be a foreign country\"); <i>King v. Earl of Crewe ex parte Sekgome,</i> [1910] 2 K.B. 576, 603-604 (C.A.) (opinion of Williams, L.J.) (arguing that the Bechuanaland Protectorate in South Africa was \"under His Majesty's dominion in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2253</span> sense of power and jurisdiction, but is not under his dominion in the sense of territorial dominion\"). Accordingly, for purposes of our analysis, we accept the Government's position that Cuba, and not the United States, retains <i>de jure</i> sovereignty over Guantanamo Bay. As we did in <i>Rasul,</i> however, we take notice of the obvious and uncontested fact that the United States, by virtue of its complete jurisdiction and control over the base, maintains <i>de facto</i> sovereignty over this territory. See 542 U.S., at 480, 124 S.Ct. 2686; <i>id.,</i> at 487, 124 S.Ct. 2686 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>Were we to hold that the present cases turn on the political question doctrine, we would be required first to accept the Government's premise that <i>de jure</i> sovereignty is the touchstone of habeas corpus jurisdiction. This premise, however, is unfounded. For the reasons indicated above, the history of common-law habeas corpus provides scant support for this proposition; and, for the reasons indicated below, that position would be inconsistent with our precedents and contrary to fundamental separation-of-powers principles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Court has discussed the issue of the Constitution's extraterritorial application on many occasions. These decisions undermine the Government's argument that, at least as applied to noncitizens, the Constitution necessarily stops where <i>de jure</i> sovereignty ends.</p>\n<p>The Framers foresaw that the United States would expand and acquire new territories. See <i>American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85595\"><a href=\"/opinion/85595/american-ins-co-v-356-bales-of-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 542, 7 L.Ed. 242 (1828). Article IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 1, grants Congress the power to admit new States. Clause 2 of the same section grants Congress the \"Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.\" Save for a few notable (and notorious) exceptions, <i>e.g., </i><i>Dred Scott v. Sandford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87116\"><a href=\"/opinion/87116/dred-scott-v-sandford/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 15 L.Ed. 691 (1857), throughout most of our history there was little need to explore the outer boundaries of the Constitution's geographic reach. When Congress exercised its power to create new territories, it guaranteed constitutional protections to the inhabitants by statute. See, <i>e.g.,</i> An Act: to establish a Territorial Government for Utah, 9 Stat. 458 (\"[T]he Constitution and laws of the United States are hereby extended over and declared to be in force in said Territory of Utah\"); Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1891 (\"The Constitution and all laws of the United States which are not locally inapplicable shall have the same force and effect within all the organized Territories, and in every Territory hereafter organized as elsewhere within the United States\"); see generally Burnett, <i>Untied</i> States: American Expansion and Territorial Deannexation, 72 U. Chi. L.Rev. 797, 825-827 (2005). In particular, there was no need to test the limits of the Suspension Clause because, as early as 1789, Congress extended the writ to the Territories. See Act of Aug. 7, 1789, 1 Stat. 52 (reaffirming Art. II of Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which provided that \"[t]he inhabitants of the said territory, shall always be entitled to the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus\").</p>\n<p>Fundamental questions regarding the Constitution's geographic scope first arose at the dawn of the 20th century when the Nation acquired noncontiguous Territories: Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines\u0097 ceded to the United States by Spain at the conclusion of the Spanish-American War\u0097 and Hawaii\u0097annexed by the United States in 1898. At this point Congress chose to discontinue its previous practice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2254</span> of extending constitutional rights to the territories by statute. See, <i>e.g.,</i> An Act Temporarily to provide for the administration of the affairs of civil government in the Philippine Islands, and for other purposes, 32 Stat. 692 (noting that Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1891 did not apply to the Philippines).</p>\n<p>In a series of opinions later known as the Insular Cases, the Court addressed whether the Constitution, by its own force, applies in any territory that is not a State. See <i>De Lima v. Bidwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95500\"><a href=\"/opinion/95500/de-lima-v-bidwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 21 S.Ct. 743, 45 L.Ed. 1041 (1901); <i>Dooley v.

The Court held that the Constitution has independent force in these territories, a force not contingent upon acts of legislative grace. Yet it took note of the difficulties inherent in that position.</p>\n<p>Prior to their cession to the United States, the former Spanish colonies operated under a civil-law system, without experience in the various aspects of the Anglo-American legal tradition, for instance the use of grand and petit juries. At least with regard to the Philippines, a complete transformation of the prevailing legal culture would have been not only disruptive but also unnecessary, as the United States intended to grant independence to that Territory. See An Act To declare the purpose of the people of the United States as to the future political status of the people of the Philippine Islands, and to provide a more autonomous government for those islands (Jones Act), 39 Stat. 545 (noting that \"it was never the intention of the people of the United States in the incipiency of the War with Spain to make it a war of conquest or for territorial aggrandizement\" and that \"it is, as it has always been, the purpose of the people of the United States to withdraw their sovereignty over the Philippine Islands and to recognize their independence as soon as a stable government can be established therein\"). The Court thus was reluctant to risk the uncertainty and instability that could result from a rule that displaced altogether the existing legal systems in these newly acquired Territories. See <i>Downes, supra,</i> at 282, 21 S.Ct. 770 (\"It is obvious that in the annexation of outlying and distant possessions grave questions will arise from differences of race, habits, laws and customs of the people, and from differences of soil, climate and production...\").</p>\n<p>These considerations resulted in the doctrine of territorial incorporation, under which the Constitution applies in full in incorporated Territories surely destined for statehood but only in part in unincorporated Territories. See <i>Dorr, supra,</i> at 143, 24 S.Ct. 808 (\"Until Congress shall see fit to incorporate territory ceded by treaty into the United States, ... the territory is to be governed under the power existing in Congress to make laws for such territories and subject to such constitutional restrictions upon the powers of that body as are applicable to the situation\"); <i>Downes, supra,</i> at 293, 21 S.Ct. 770 (White, J., concurring) (\"[T]he determination of what particular provision of the Constitution is applicable, generally speaking, in all cases, involves an inquiry into the situation of the territory and its relations to the United States\"). As the Court later made clear, \"the real issue in the <i>Insular Cases</i> was not whether the Constitution extended to the Philippines or Porto Rico when we went there, but which of its provisions were applicable by way of limitation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2255</span> upon the exercise of executive and legislative power in dealing with new conditions and requirements.\" <i>Balzac v. Porto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99954\"><a href=\"/opinion/99954/balzac-v-porto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 312, 42 S.Ct. 343, 66 L.Ed. 627 (1922). It may well be that over time the ties between the United States and any of its unincorporated Territories strengthen in ways that are of constitutional significance. Cf. <i>Torres v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620876\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620876/torres-v-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 475-476, 99 S.Ct. 2425, 61 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (\"Whatever the validity of the [Insular Cases] in the particular historical context in which they were decided, those cases are clearly not authority for questioning the application of the Fourth Amendment\u0097or any other provision of the Bill of Rights\u0097to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in the 1970's\"). But, as early as <i>Balzac</i> in 1922, the Court took for granted that even in unincorporated Territories the Government of the United States was bound to provide to noncitizen inhabitants \"guaranties of certain fundamental personal rights declared in the Constitution.\" 258 U.S., at 312, 42 S.Ct. 343; see also <i>Late Corp. of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92810\"><a href=\"/opinion/92810/late-corp-of-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 44, 10 S.Ct. 792, 34 L.Ed. 478 (1890) (\"Doubtless Congress, in legislating for the Territories would be subject to those fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights which are formulated in the Constitution and its amendments\"). Yet noting the inherent practical difficulties of enforcing all constitutional provisions \"always and everywhere,\" <i>Balzac, supra,</i> at 312, 42 S.Ct. 343, the Court devised in the Insular Cases a doctrine that allowed it to use its power sparingly and where it would be most needed. This century-old doctrine informs our analysis in the present matter.</p>\n<p>Practical considerations likewise influenced the Court's analysis a half-century later in <i>Reid,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105525\"><a href=\"/opinion/105525/reid-v-covert/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148. The petitioners there, spouses of American servicemen, lived on American military bases in England and Japan. They were charged with crimes committed in those countries and tried before military courts, consistent with executive agreements the United States had entered into with the British and Japanese governments. <i>Id.,</i> at 15-16, and nn. 29-30, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (plurality opinion). Because the petitioners were not themselves military personnel, they argued they were entitled to trial by jury.</p>\n<p>Justice Black, writing for the plurality, contrasted the cases before him with the Insular Cases, which involved territories \"with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions\" that Congress intended to govern only \"temporarily.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 14, 77 S.Ct. 1222. Justice Frankfurter argued that the \"specific circumstances of each particular case\" are relevant in determining the geographic scope of the Constitution. <i>Id.,</i> at 54, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (opinion concurring in result). And Justice Harlan, who had joined an opinion reaching the opposite result in the case in the previous Term, <i>Reid v. Covert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105413\"><a href=\"/opinion/105413/reid-v-covert/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span>, 76 S.Ct. 880, 100 L.Ed. 1352 (1956), was most explicit in rejecting a \"rigid and abstract rule\" for determining where constitutional guarantees extend. <i>Reid,</i> 354 U.S., at 74, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (opinion concurring in result). He read the Insular Cases to teach that whether a constitutional provision has extraterritorial effect depends upon the \"particular circumstances, the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives which Congress had before it\" and, in particular, whether judicial enforcement of the provision would be \"impracticable and anomalous.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 74-75, 77 S.Ct. 1222; see also <i>United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112382\"><a href=\"/opinion/112382/united-states-v-verdugo-urquidez/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 277-278, 110 S.Ct. 1056, 108 L.Ed.2d 222 (1990) (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (applying the \"impracticable and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2256</span> anomalous\" extraterritoriality test in the Fourth Amendment context).</p>\n<p>That the petitioners in <i>Reid</i> were American citizens was a key factor in the case and was central to the plurality's conclusion that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments apply to American civilians tried outside the United States. But practical considerations, related not to the petitioners' citizenship but to the place of their confinement and trial, were relevant to each Member of the <i>Reid</i> majority. And to Justices Harlan and Frankfurter (whose votes were necessary to the Court's disposition) these considerations were the decisive factors in the case.</p>\n<p>Indeed the majority splintered on this very point. The key disagreement between the plurality and the concurring Justices in <i>Reid</i> was over the continued precedential value of the Court's previous opinion in <i>In re Ross,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93107\"><a href=\"/opinion/93107/in-re-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 11 S.Ct. 897, 35 L.Ed. 581 (1891), which the <i>Reid</i> Court understood as holding that under some circumstances Americans abroad have no right to indictment and trial by jury. The petitioner in <i>Ross</i> was a sailor serving on an American merchant vessel in Japanese waters who was tried before an American consular tribunal for the murder of a fellow crewman. 140 U.S., at 459, 479, 11 S.Ct. 897. The <i>Ross</i> Court held that the petitioner, who was a British subject, had no rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. <i>Id.,</i> at 464, 11 S.Ct. 897. The petitioner's citizenship played no role in the disposition of the case, however. The Court assumed (consistent with the maritime custom of the time) that Ross had all the rights of a similarly situated American citizen. <i>Id.,</i> at 479, 11 S.Ct. 897 (noting that Ross was \"under the protection and subject to the laws of the United States equally with the seaman who was native born\"). The Justices in <i>Reid</i> therefore properly understood <i>Ross</i> as standing for the proposition that, at least in some circumstances, the jury provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments have no application to American citizens tried by American authorities abroad. See 354 U.S., at 11-12, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (plurality opinion) (describing <i>Ross</i> as holding that \"constitutional protections applied `only to citizens and others within the United States ... and not to residents or temporary sojourners abroad'\" (quoting <i>Ross, supra,</i> at 464, 11 S.Ct. 897)); 354 U.S., at 64, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result) (noting that the consular tribunals upheld in <i>Ross</i> \"w[ere] based on long-established custom and they were justified as the best possible means for securing justice for the few Americans present in [foreign] countries\"); 354 U.S., at 75, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Harlan, J., concurring in result) (\"what <i>Ross</i> and the <i>Insular Cases</i> hold is that the particular local setting, the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives are relevant to a question of judgment, namely, whether jury trial <i>should</i> be deemed a necessary condition of the exercise of Congress' power to provide for the trial of Americans overseas\").</p>\n<p>The <i>Reid</i> plurality doubted that <i>Ross</i> was rightly decided, precisely because it believed the opinion was insufficiently protective of the rights of American citizens. See 354 U.S., at 10-12, 77 S.Ct. 1222; see also <i>id.,</i> at 78, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Clark, J., dissenting) (noting that \"four of my brothers would specifically overrule and two would impair the long-recognized vitality of an old and respected precedent in our law, the case of <i>In re Ross,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93107\"><a href=\"/opinion/93107/in-re-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 11 S.Ct. 897, 35 L.Ed. 581 (1891)\"). But Justices Harlan and Frankfurter, while willing to hold that the American citizen petitioners in the cases before them were entitled to the protections of Fifth and Sixth Amendments, were unwilling to overturn <i>Ross.</i> 354 U.S., at 64, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2257</span> <i>id.,</i> at 75, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Instead, the two concurring Justices distinguished <i>Ross</i> from the cases before them, not on the basis of the citizenship of the petitioners, but on practical considerations that made jury trial a more feasible option for them than it was for the petitioner in <i>Ross.</i> If citizenship had been the only relevant factor in the case, it would have been necessary for the Court to overturn <i>Ross,</i> something Justices Harlan and Frankfurter were unwilling to do. See <i>Verdugo-Urquidez, supra,</i> at 277, 110 S.Ct. 1056 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (noting that <i>Ross</i> had not been overruled).</p>\n<p>Practical considerations weighed heavily as well in <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104813\"><a href=\"/opinion/104813/johnson-v-eisentrager/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span>, 70 S.Ct. 936, 94 L.Ed. 1255 (1950), where the Court addressed whether habeas corpus jurisdiction extended to enemy aliens who had been convicted of violating the laws of war. The prisoners were detained at Landsberg Prison in Germany during the Allied Powers' postwar occupation. The Court stressed the difficulties of ordering the Government to produce the prisoners in a habeas corpus proceeding. It \"would require allocation of shipping space, guarding personnel, billeting and rations\" and would damage the prestige of military commanders at a sensitive time. <i>Id.,</i> at 779, 70 S.Ct. 936. In considering these factors the Court sought to balance the constraints of military occupation with constitutional necessities. <i>Id.,</i> at 769-779, 70 S.Ct. 936; see <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 475-476, 124 S.Ct. 2686 (discussing the factors relevant to <i>Eisentrager</i>'s constitutional holding); 542 U.S., at 486, 124 S.Ct. 2686 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (same).</p>\n<p>True, the Court in <i>Eisentrager</i> denied access to the writ, and it noted the prisoners \"at no relevant time were within any territory over which the United States is sovereign, and [that] the scenes of their offense, their capture, their trial and their punishment were all beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.\" 339 U.S., at 778, 70 S.Ct. 936. The Government seizes upon this language as proof positive that the <i>Eisentrager</i> Court adopted a formalistic, sovereignty-based test for determining the reach of the Suspension Clause. See Brief for Respondents 18-20. We reject this reading for three reasons.</p>\n<p>First, we do not accept the idea that the above-quoted passage from <i>Eisentrager</i> is the only authoritative language in the opinion and that all the rest is dicta. The Court's further determinations, based on practical considerations, were integral to Part II of its opinion and came before the decision announced its holding. See 339 U.S., at 781, 70 S.Ct. 936.</p>\n<p>Second, because the United States lacked both <i>de jure</i> sovereignty and plenary control over Landsberg Prison, see <i>infra,</i> at 2258-2259, it is far from clear that the <i>Eisentrager</i> Court used the term sovereignty only in the narrow technical sense and not to connote the degree of control the military asserted over the facility. See <i>supra,</i> at 2250-2251. The Justices who decided <i>Eisentrager</i> would have understood sovereignty as a multifaceted concept. See Black's Law Dictionary 1568 (4th ed.1951) (defining \"sovereignty\" as \"[t]he supreme, absolute, and uncontrollable power by which any independent state is governed\"; \"the international independence of a state, combined with the right and power of regulating its internal affairs without foreign dictation\"; and \"[t]he power to do everything in a state without accountability\"); Ballentine's Law Dictionary with Pronunciations 1216 (2d ed.1948) (defining \"sovereignty\" as \"[t]hat public authority which commands in civil society, and orders and directs what each citizen is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2258</span> to perform to obtain the end of its institution\"). In its principal brief in <i>Eisentrager,</i> the Government advocated a bright-line test for determining the scope of the writ, similar to the one it advocates in these cases. See Brief for Petitioners in <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager</i><i>,</i> O.T.1949, No. 306, pp. 74-75. Yet the Court mentioned the concept of territorial sovereignty only twice in its opinion. See <i>Eisentrager, supra,</i> at 778, 780, 70 S.Ct. 936. That the Court devoted a significant portion of Part II to a discussion of practical barriers to the running of the writ suggests that the Court was not concerned exclusively with the formal legal status of Landsberg Prison but also with the objective degree of control the United States asserted over it. Even if we assume the <i>Eisentrager</i> Court considered the United States' lack of formal legal sovereignty over Landsberg Prison as the decisive factor in that case, its holding is not inconsistent with a functional approach to questions of extraterritoriality. The formal legal status of a given territory affects, at least to some extent, the political branches' control over that territory. <i>De jure</i> sovereignty is a factor that bears upon which constitutional guarantees apply there.</p>\n<p>Third, if the Government's reading of <i>Eisentrager</i> were correct, the opinion would have marked not only a change in, but a complete repudiation of, the Insular Cases' (and later <i>Reid</i>'s) functional approach to questions of extraterritoriality. We cannot accept the Government's view. Nothing in <i>Eisentrager</i> says that <i>de jure</i> sovereignty is or has ever been the only relevant consideration in determining the geographic reach of the Constitution or of habeas corpus. Were that the case, there would be considerable tension between <i>Eisentrager,</i> on the one hand, and the Insular Cases and <i>Reid,</i> on the other. Our cases need not be read to conflict in this manner. A constricted reading of <i>Eisentrager</i> overlooks what we see as a common thread uniting the Insular Cases, <i>Eisentrager,</i> and <i>Reid:</i> the idea that questions of extraterritoriality turn on objective factors and practical concerns, not formalism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Government's formal sovereignty-based test raises troubling separation-of-powers concerns as well. The political history of Guantanamo illustrates the deficiencies of this approach. The United States has maintained complete and uninterrupted control of the bay for over 100 years. At the close of the Spanish-American War, Spain ceded control over the entire island of Cuba to the United States and specifically \"relinquishe[d] all claim[s] of sovereignty ... and title.\" See Treaty of Paris, Dec. 10, 1898, U.S.-Spain, Art. I, 30 Stat. 1755, T.S. No. 343. From the date the treaty with Spain was signed until the Cuban Republic was established on May 20, 1902, the United States governed the territory \"in trust\" for the benefit of the Cuban people. <i>Neely v. Henkel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95398\"><a href=\"/opinion/95398/neely-v-henkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span>, 120, 21 S.Ct. 302, 45 L.Ed. 448 (1901); H. Thomas, Cuba or The Pursuit of Freedom 436, 460 (1998). And although it recognized, by entering into the 1903 Lease Agreement, that Cuba retained \"ultimate sovereignty\" over Guantanamo, the United States continued to maintain the same plenary control it had enjoyed since 1898. Yet the Government's view is that the Constitution had no effect there, at least as to noncitizens, because the United States disclaimed sovereignty in the formal sense of the term. The necessary implication of the argument is that by surrendering formal sovereignty over any unincorporated territory to a third party, while at the same time entering into a lease that grants total control over the territory back to the United States, it would be possible for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2259</span> political branches to govern without legal constraint.</p>\n<p>Our basic charter cannot be contracted away like this. The Constitution grants Congress and the President the power to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its terms apply. Even when the United States acts outside its borders, its powers are not \"absolute and unlimited\" but are subject \"to such restrictions as are expressed in the Constitution.\" <i>Murphy v. Ramsey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91339\"><a href=\"/opinion/91339/murphy-v-ramsey/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 44, 5 S.Ct. 747, 29 L.Ed. 47 (1885). Abstaining from questions involving formal sovereignty and territorial governance is one thing. To hold the political branches have the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will is quite another. The former position reflects this Court's recognition that certain matters requiring political judgments are best left to the political branches. The latter would permit a striking anomaly in our tripartite system of government, leading to a regime in which Congress and the President, not this Court, say \"what the law is.\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).</p>\n<p>These concerns have particular bearing upon the Suspension Clause question in the cases now before us, for the writ of habeas corpus is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers. The test for determining the scope of this provision must not be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to restrain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>As we recognized in <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 476, 124 S.Ct. 2686; <i>id.,</i> at 487, 124 S.Ct. 2686 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment), the outlines of a framework for determining the reach of the Suspension Clause are suggested by the factors the Court relied upon in <i>Eisentrager.</i> In addition to the practical concerns discussed above, the <i>Eisentrager</i> Court found relevant that each petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) is an enemy alien; (b) has never been or resided in the United States; (c) was captured outside of our territory and there held in military custody as a prisoner of war; (d) was tried and convicted by a Military Commission sitting outside the United States; (e) for offenses against laws of war committed outside the United States; (f) and is at all times imprisoned outside the United States.\" 339 U.S., at 777, 70 S.Ct. 936.</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this language from <i>Eisentrager,</i> and the reasoning in our other extraterritoriality opinions, we conclude that at least three factors are relevant in determining the reach of the Suspension Clause: (1) the citizenship and status of the detainee and the adequacy of the process through which that status determination was made; (2) the nature of the sites where apprehension and then detention took place; and (3) the practical obstacles inherent in resolving the prisoner's entitlement to the writ.</p>\n<p>Applying this framework, we note at the onset that the status of these detainees is a matter of dispute. The petitioners, like those in <i>Eisentrager,</i> are not American citizens. But the petitioners in <i>Eisentrager</i> did not contest, it seems, the Court's assertion that they were \"enemy alien[s].\" <i>Ibid.</i> In the instant cases, by contrast, the detainees deny they are enemy combatants. They have been afforded some process in CSRT proceedings to determine their status; but, unlike in <i>Eisentrager, supra,</i> at 766, 70 S.Ct. 936, there has been no trial by military commission for violations of the laws of war. The difference is not trivial. The records from the <i>Eisentrager</i> trials suggest that, well before the petitioners brought their case to this Court, there had been a rigorous adversarial process to test the legality of their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2260</span> detention. The <i>Eisentrager</i> petitioners were charged by a bill of particulars that made detailed factual allegations against them. See 14 United Nations War Crimes Commission, Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals 8-10 (1949) (reprint 1997). To rebut the accusations, they were entitled to representation by counsel, allowed to introduce evidence on their own behalf, and permitted to cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses. See Memorandum by Command of Lt. Gen. Wedemeyer, Jan. 21, 1946 (establishing \"Regulations Governing the Trial of War Criminals\" in the China Theater), in Tr. of Record in <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager</i><i>,</i> O.T.1949, No. 306, pp. 34-40.</p>\n<p>In comparison the procedural protections afforded to the detainees in the CSRT hearings are far more limited, and, we conclude, fall well short of the procedures and adversarial mechanisms that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review. Although the detainee is assigned a \"Personal Representative\" to assist him during CSRT proceedings, the Secretary of the Navy's memorandum makes clear that person is not the detainee's lawyer or even his \"advocate.\" See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, at 155, 172. The Government's evidence is accorded a presumption of validity. <i>Id.,</i> at 159. The detainee is allowed to present \"reasonably available\" evidence, <i>id.,</i> at 155, but his ability to rebut the Government's evidence against him is limited by the circumstances of his confinement and his lack of counsel at this stage. And although the detainee can seek review of his status determination in the Court of Appeals, that review process cannot cure all defects in the earlier proceedings. See Part V, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>As to the second factor relevant to this analysis, the detainees here are similarly situated to the <i>Eisentrager</i> petitioners in that the sites of their apprehension and detention are technically outside the sovereign territory of the United States. As noted earlier, this is a factor that weighs against finding they have rights under the Suspension Clause. But there are critical differences between Landsberg Prison, circa 1950, and the United States Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay in 2008. Unlike its present control over the naval station, the United States' control over the prison in Germany was neither absolute nor indefinite. Like all parts of occupied Germany, the prison was under the jurisdiction of the combined Allied Forces. See Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority with Respect to Germany, June 5, 1945, U.S.-U.S.S. R.-U. K.-Fr., 60 Stat. 1649, T.I.A.S. No. 1520. The United States was therefore answerable to its Allies for all activities occurring there. Cf. <i>Hirota v. MacArthur,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></span>, 198, 69 S.Ct. 197, 93 L.Ed. 1902 (1948) <i>(per curiam)</i> (military tribunal set up by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, acting as \"the agent of the Allied Powers,\" was not a \"tribunal of the United States\"). The Allies had not planned a long-term occupation of Germany, nor did they intend to displace all German institutions even during the period of occupation. See Agreements Respecting Basic Principles for Merger of the Three Western German Zones of Occupation, and Other Matters, Apr. 8, 1949, U.S.-U. K.-Fr., Art. 1, 63 Stat. 2819, T.I.A.S. No.2066 (establishing a governing framework \"[d]uring the period in which it is necessary that the occupation continue\" and expressing the desire \"that the German people shall enjoy self-government to the maximum possible degree consistent with such occupation\"). The Court's holding in <i>Eisentrager</i> was thus consistent with the Insular Cases, where it had held there was no need to extend full constitutional protections to territories the United <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2261</span> States did not intend to govern indefinitely. Guantanamo Bay, on the other hand, is no transient possession. In every practical sense Guantanamo is not abroad; it is within the constant jurisdiction of the United States. See <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 480, 124 S.Ct. 2686; <i>id.,</i> at 487, 124 S.Ct. 2686 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>As to the third factor, we recognize, as the Court did in <i>Eisentrager,</i> that there are costs to holding the Suspension Clause applicable in a case of military detention abroad. Habeas corpus proceedings may require expenditure of funds by the Government and may divert the attention of military personnel from other pressing tasks. While we are sensitive to these concerns, we do not find them dispositive. Compliance with any judicial process requires some incremental expenditure of resources. Yet civilian courts and the Armed Forces have functioned along side each other at various points in our history. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Duncan v. Kahanamoku,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104246\"><a href=\"/opinion/104246/duncan-v-kahanamoku/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 66 S.Ct. 606, 90 L.Ed. 688 (1946); <i>Ex parte Milligan,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span>, 18 L.Ed. 281 (1866). The Government presents no credible arguments that the military mission at Guantanamo would be compromised if habeas corpus courts had jurisdiction to hear the detainees' claims. And in light of the plenary control the United States asserts over the base, none are apparent to us.</p>\n<p>The situation in <i>Eisentrager</i> was far different, given the historical context and nature of the military's mission in post-War Germany. When hostilities in the European Theater came to an end, the United States became responsible for an occupation zone encompassing over 57,000 square miles with a population of 18 million. See Letter from President Truman to Secretary of State Byrnes, (Nov. 28, 1945), in 8 Documents on American Foreign Relations 257 (R. Dennett &amp; R. Turner eds.1948); Pollock, A Territorial Pattern for the Military Occupation of Germany, 38 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 970, 975 (1944). In addition to supervising massive reconstruction and aid efforts the American forces stationed in Germany faced potential security threats from a defeated enemy. In retrospect the post-War occupation may seem uneventful. But at the time <i>Eisentrager</i> was decided, the Court was right to be concerned about judicial interference with the military's efforts to contain \"enemy elements, guerilla fighters, and `were-wolves.'\" 339 U.S., at 784, 70 S.Ct. 936.</p>\n<p>Similar threats are not apparent here; nor does the Government argue that they are. The United States Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay consists of 45 square miles of land and water. The base has been used, at various points, to house migrants and refugees temporarily. At present, however, other than the detainees themselves, the only long-term residents are American military personnel, their families, and a small number of workers. See History of Guantanamo Bay online at https://www.cnic. navy.mil/Guantanamo/AboutGTMO/gtmohistorygeneral/ gtmohistgeneral. The detainees have been deemed enemies of the United States. At present, dangerous as they may be if released, they are contained in a secure prison facility located on an isolated and heavily fortified military base.</p>\n<p>There is no indication, furthermore, that adjudicating a habeas corpus petition would cause friction with the host government. No Cuban court has jurisdiction over American military personnel at Guantanamo or the enemy combatants detained there. While obligated to abide by the terms of the lease, the United States is, for all practical purposes, answerable to no other sovereign for its acts on the base. Were that not the case, or if the detention <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2262</span> facility were located in an active theater of war, arguments that issuing the writ would be \"impracticable or anomalous\" would have more weight. See <i>Reid,</i> 354 U.S., at 74, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Under the facts presented here, however, there are few practical barriers to the running of the writ. To the extent barriers arise, habeas corpus procedures likely can be modified to address them. See Part VI-B, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>It is true that before today the Court has never held that noncitizens detained by our Government in territory over which another country maintains <i>de jure</i> sovereignty have any rights under our Constitution. But the cases before us lack any precise historical parallel. They involve individuals detained by executive order for the duration of a conflict that, if measured from September 11, 2001, to the present, is already among the longest wars in American history. See Oxford Companion to American Military History 849 (1999). The detainees, moreover, are held in a territory that, while technically not part of the United States, is under the complete and total control of our Government. Under these circumstances the lack of a precedent on point is no barrier to our holding.</p>\n<p>We hold that Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2, of the Constitution has full effect at Guantanamo Bay. If the privilege of habeas corpus is to be denied to the detainees now before us, Congress must act in accordance with the requirements of the Suspension Clause. Cf. <i>Hamdi,</i> 542 U.S., at 564, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"[I]ndefinite imprisonment on reasonable suspicion is not an available option of treatment for those accused of aiding the enemy, absent a suspension of the writ\"). This Court may not impose a <i>de facto</i> suspension by abstaining from these controversies. See <i>Hamdan,</i> 548 U.S., at 585, n. 16, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (\"[A]bstention is not appropriate in cases ... in which the legal challenge `turn[s] on the status of the persons as to whom the military asserted its power'\" (quoting <i>Schlesinger v. Councilman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109224\"><a href=\"/opinion/109224/schlesinger-v-councilman/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, 759, 95 S.Ct. 1300, 43 L.Ed.2d 591 (1975))). The MCA does not purport to be a formal suspension of the writ; and the Government, in its submissions to us, has not argued that it is. Petitioners, therefore, are entitled to the privilege of habeas corpus to challenge the legality of their detention.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>In light of this holding the question becomes whether the statute stripping jurisdiction to issue the writ avoids the Suspension Clause mandate because Congress has provided adequate substitute procedures for habeas corpus. The Government submits there has been compliance with the Suspension Clause because the DTA review process in the Court of Appeals, see DTA \u00a7 1005(e), provides an adequate substitute. Congress has granted that court jurisdiction to consider</p>\n<blockquote>\"(i) whether the status determination of the [CSRT] ... was consistent with the standards and procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense ... and (ii) to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to make the determination is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742.</blockquote>\n<p>The Court of Appeals, having decided that the writ does not run to the detainees in any event, found it unnecessary to consider whether an adequate substitute has been provided. In the ordinary course we would remand to the Court of Appeals to consider this question in the first instance. See <i>Youakim v. Miller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109422\"><a href=\"/opinion/109422/youakim-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 234, 96 S.Ct. 1399, 47 L.Ed.2d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2263</span> 701 (1976) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> It is well settled, however, that the Court's practice of declining to address issues left unresolved in earlier proceedings is not an inflexible rule. <i>Ibid.</i> Departure from the rule is appropriate in \"exceptional\" circumstances. See <i>Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137734\"><a href=\"/opinion/137734/cooper-industries-inc-v-aviall-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 169, 125 S.Ct. 577, 160 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004); <i>Duignan v.

The parties before us have addressed the adequacy issue. While we would have found it informative to consider the reasoning of the Court of Appeals on this point, we must weigh that against the harms petitioners may endure from additional delay. And, given there are few precedents addressing what features an adequate substitute for habeas corpus must contain, in all likelihood a remand simply would delay ultimate resolution of the issue by this Court.</p>\n<p>We do have the benefit of the Court of Appeals' construction of key provisions of the DTA. When we granted certiorari in these cases, we noted \"it would be of material assistance to consult any decision\" in the parallel DTA review proceedings pending in the Court of Appeals, specifically any rulings in the matter of <i>Bismullah v. Gates.</i> 551 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1345, 170 L.Ed.2d 271 (2007). Although the Court of Appeals has yet to complete a DTA review proceeding, the three-judge panel in <i>Bismullah</i> has issued an interim order giving guidance as to what evidence can be made part of the record on review and what access the detainees can have to counsel and to classified information. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460165\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460165/bismullah-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span> (C.A.D.C.) <i>(Bismullah I),</i> reh'g denied, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1218036\"><a href=\"/opinion/1218036/bismullah-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span> (C.A.D.C.2007) <i>(Bismullah II).</i> In that matter the full court denied the Government's motion for rehearing en banc, see <i>Bismullah v.

This simply confirms the care Congress has taken throughout our Nation's history to preserve the writ and its function. Indeed, most of the major legislative enactments pertaining to habeas corpus have acted not to contract the writ's protection but to expand it or to hasten resolution of prisoners' claims. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, ch. 28, \u00a7 1, 14 Stat. 385 (current version codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (extending the federal writ to state prisoners)); Cf. <i>Harris v. Nelson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107877\"><a href=\"/opinion/107877/harris-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span>, 299-300, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 22 L.Ed.2d 281 (1969) (interpreting the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, to allow discovery in habeas corpus proceedings); <i>Peyton v. Rowe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107679\"><a href=\"/opinion/107679/peyton-v-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 64-65, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968) (interpreting the then-existing version of \u00a7 2241 to allow petitioner to proceed with his habeas corpus action, even though he had not yet begun to serve his sentence).</p>\n<p>There are exceptions, of course. Title I of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2264</span> Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \u00a7 106, 110 Stat. 1220, contains certain gatekeeping provisions that restrict a prisoner's ability to bring new and repetitive claims in \"second or successive\" habeas corpus actions. We upheld these provisions against a Suspension Clause challenge in <i>Felker v. Turpin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118058\"><a href=\"/opinion/118058/felker-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 662-664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996). The provisions at issue in <i>Felker,</i> however, did not constitute a substantial departure from common-law habeas procedures. The provisions, for the most part, codified the longstanding abuse-of-the-writ doctrine. <i>Id.,</i> at 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333; see also <i>McCleskey v. Zant,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112573\"><a href=\"/opinion/112573/mccleskey-v-zant/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 489, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991). AEDPA applies, moreover, to federal, postconviction review after criminal proceedings in state court have taken place. As of this point, cases discussing the implementation of that statute give little helpful instruction (save perhaps by contrast) for the instant cases, where no trial has been held.</p>\n<p>The two leading cases addressing habeas substitutes, <i>Swain v. Pressley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109623\"><a href=\"/opinion/109623/swain-v-pressley/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span>, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977), and <i>United States v. Hayman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104948\"><a href=\"/opinion/104948/united-states-v-hayman/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span>, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952), likewise provide little guidance here. The statutes at issue were attempts to streamline habeas corpus relief, not to cut it back.</p>\n<p>The statute discussed in <i>Hayman</i> was 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. It replaced traditional habeas corpus for federal prisoners (at least in the first instance) with a process that allowed the prisoner to file a motion with the sentencing court on the ground that his sentence was, <i>inter alia,</i> \"`imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.'\" 342 U.S., at 207, n. 1, 72 S.Ct. 263. The purpose and effect of the statute was not to restrict access to the writ but to make postconviction proceedings more efficient. It directed claims not to the court that had territorial jurisdiction over the place of the petitioner's confinement but to the sentencing court, a court already familiar with the facts of the case. As the <i>Hayman</i> Court explained</p>\n<blockquote>\"Section 2255 ... was passed at the instance of the Judicial Conference to meet practical difficulties that had arisen in administering the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal courts. Nowhere in the history of Section 2255 do we find any purpose to impinge upon prisoners' rights of collateral attack upon their convictions. On the contrary, the sole purpose was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 219, 72 S.Ct. 263.</blockquote>\n<p>See also <i>Hill v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106329\"><a href=\"/opinion/106329/hill-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 427, 428, and n. 5, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962) (noting that \u00a7 2255 provides a remedy in the sentencing court that is \"exactly commensurate\" with the pre-existing federal habeas corpus remedy).</p>\n<p>The statute in <i>Swain,</i> D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 23-110(g) (1973), applied to prisoners in custody under sentence of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Before enactment of the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970 (D.C. Court Reform Act), 84 Stat. 473, those prisoners could file habeas petitions in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The Act, which was patterned on \u00a7 2255, substituted a new collateral process in the Superior Court for the pre-existing habeas corpus procedure in the District Court. See <i>Swain,</i> 430 U.S., at 374-378, 97 S.Ct. 1224. But, again, the purpose and effect of the statute was to expedite consideration of the prisoner's claims, not to delay or frustrate it. See <i>id.,</i> at 375, n. 4, 97 S.Ct. 1224 (noting that the purpose of the D.C. Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2265</span> Reform Act was to \"alleviate\" administrative burdens on the District Court).</p>\n<p>That the statutes in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain</i> were designed to strengthen, rather than dilute, the writ's protections was evident, furthermore, from this significant fact: Neither statute eliminated traditional habeas corpus relief. In both cases the statute at issue had a saving clause, providing that a writ of habeas corpus would be available if the alternative process proved inadequate or ineffective. <i>Swain, supra,</i> at 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224; <i>Hayman, supra,</i> at 223, 72 S.Ct. 263. The Court placed explicit reliance upon these provisions in upholding the statutes against constitutional challenges. See <i>Swain, supra,</i> at 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224 (noting that the provision \"avoid[ed] any serious question about the constitutionality of the statute\"); <i>Hayman, supra,</i> at 223, 72 S.Ct. 263 (noting that, because habeas remained available as a last resort, it was unnecessary to \"reach constitutional questions\").</p>\n<p>Unlike in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain,</i> here we confront statutes, the DTA and the MCA, that were intended to circumscribe habeas review. Congress' purpose is evident not only from the unequivocal nature of MCA \u00a7 7's jurisdiction-stripping language, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(e)(1) (Supp. 2007) (\"No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus...\"), but also from a comparison of the DTA to the statutes at issue in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain.</i> When interpreting a statute, we examine related provisions in other parts of the U.S.Code. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112559\"><a href=\"/opinion/112559/west-virginia-univ-hospitals-inc-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 88-97, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68 (1991); <i>Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462772\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462772/babbitt-v-sweet-home-chapter-communities-for-great/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 717-718, 115 S.Ct. 2407, 132 L.Ed.2d 597 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); see generally W. Eskridge, P. Frickey, &amp; E. Garrett, Cases and Materials on Legislation: Statutes and the Creation of Public Policy 1039 (3d ed.2001). When Congress has intended to replace traditional habeas corpus with habeas-like substitutes, as was the case in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain,</i> it has granted to the courts broad remedial powers to secure the historic office of the writ. In the \u00a7 2255 context, for example, Congress has granted to the reviewing court power to \"determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law\" with respect to whether \"the judgment [of conviction] was rendered without jurisdiction, or ... the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack.\" 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255(b) (Supp.2008). The D.C. Court Reform Act, the statute upheld in <i>Swain,</i> contained a similar provision. \u00a7 23-110(g), 84 Stat. 609.</p>\n<p>In contrast the DTA's jurisdictional grant is quite limited. The Court of Appeals has jurisdiction not to inquire into the legality of the detention generally but only to assess whether the CSRT complied with the \"standards and procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense\" and whether those standards and procedures are lawful. DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742. If Congress had envisioned DTA review as coextensive with traditional habeas corpus, it would not have drafted the statute in this manner. Instead, it would have used language similar to what it used in the statutes at issue in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain.</i> Cf. <i>Russello v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (\"`[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Wong Kim Bo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"307927\"><a href=\"/opinion/307927/united-states-v-wong-kim-bo-aka-yee-kuk-ho-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span>, 722 (C.A.5 1972))). Unlike in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain,</i> moreover, there has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2266</span> been no effort to preserve habeas corpus review as an avenue of last resort. No saving clause exists in either the MCA or the DTA. And MCA \u00a7 7 eliminates habeas review for these petitioners.</p>\n<p>The differences between the DTA and the habeas statute that would govern in MCA \u00a7 7's absence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000 ed. and Supp. V), are likewise telling. In \u00a7 2241 (2000 ed.) Congress confirmed the authority of \"any justice\" or \"circuit judge\" to issue the writ. Cf. <i>Felker,</i> 518 U.S., at 660-661, 116 S.Ct. 2333 (interpreting Title I of AEDPA to not strip from this Court the power to entertain original habeas corpus petitions). That statute accommodates the necessity for factfinding that will arise in some cases by allowing the appellate judge or Justice to transfer the case to a district court of competent jurisdiction, whose institutional capacity for factfinding is superior to his or her own. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(b). By granting the Court of Appeals \"exclusive\" jurisdiction over petitioners' cases, see DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(A), 119 Stat. 2742, Congress has foreclosed that option. This choice indicates Congress intended the Court of Appeals to have a more limited role in enemy combatant status determinations than a district court has in habeas corpus proceedings. The DTA should be interpreted to accord some latitude to the Court of Appeals to fashion procedures necessary to make its review function a meaningful one, but, if congressional intent is to be respected, the procedures adopted cannot be as extensive or as protective of the rights of the detainees as they would be in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. Otherwise there would have been no, or very little, purpose for enacting the DTA.</p>\n<p>To the extent any doubt remains about Congress' intent, the legislative history confirms what the plain text strongly suggests: In passing the DTA Congress did not intend to create a process that differs from traditional habeas corpus process in name only. It intended to create a more limited procedure. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 151 Cong. Rec. S14263 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen.

Kyl) (\"It is important to note that the limited judicial review authorized by paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection (e) [of DTA \u00a7 1005] are not habeas-corpus review. It is a limited judicial review of its own nature\").</p>\n<p>It is against this background that we must interpret the DTA and assess its adequacy as a substitute for habeas corpus. The present cases thus test the limits of the Suspension Clause in ways that <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain</i> did not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>We do not endeavor to offer a comprehensive summary of the requisites for an adequate substitute for habeas corpus. We do consider it uncontroversial, however, that the privilege of habeas corpus entitles the prisoner to a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pursuant to \"the erroneous application or interpretation\" of relevant law. <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S., at 302, 121 S.Ct. 2271. And the habeas court must have the power to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully detained\u0097though release need not be the exclusive remedy and is not the appropriate one in every case in which the writ is granted. See <i>Ex parte Bollman,</i> 4 Cranch 75, 136, 2 L.Ed. 554 (1807) (where imprisonment is unlawful, the court \"can only direct [the prisoner] to be discharged\"); R. Hurd, Treatise on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2267</span> Right of Personal Liberty, and On the Writ of Habeas Corpus and the Practice Connected with It: With a View of the Law of Extradition of Fugitives 222 (2d ed. 1876) (\"It cannot be denied where `a probable ground is shown that the party is imprisoned without just cause, and therefore, hath a right to be delivered,' for the writ then becomes a `writ of right, which may not be denied but ought to be granted to every man that is committed or detained in prison or otherwise restrained of his liberty'\"). But see <i>Chessman v. Teets,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105525\"><a href=\"/opinion/105525/reid-v-covert/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>56, 165-166, 77 S.Ct. 1127, 1 L.Ed.2d 1253 (1957) (remanding in a habeas case for retrial within a \"reasonable time\"). These are the easily identified attributes of any constitutionally adequate habeas corpus proceeding. But, depending on the circumstances, more may be required.</p>\n<p>Indeed, common-law habeas corpus was, above all, an adaptable remedy. Its precise application and scope changed depending upon the circumstances. See 3 Blackstone *131 (describing habeas as \"the great and efficacious writ, in all manner of illegal confinement\"); see also <i>Schlup v. Delo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117893\"><a href=\"/opinion/117893/schlup-v-delo/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 319, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995) (Habeas \"is, at its core, an equitable remedy\"); <i>Jones v.

It appears the common-law habeas court's role was most extensive in cases of pretrial and noncriminal detention, where there had been little or no previous judicial review of the cause for detention. Notably, the black-letter rule that prisoners could not controvert facts in the jailer's return was not followed (or at least not with consistency) in such cases. Hurd, <i>supra,</i> at 271 (noting that the general rule was \"subject to exceptions\" including cases of bail and impressment); Oakes, Legal History in the High Court\u0097Habeas Corpus, 64 Mich. L.Rev. 451, 457 (1966) (\"[W]hen a prisoner applied for habeas corpus before indictment or trial, some courts examined the written depositions on which he had been arrested or committed, and others even heard oral testimony to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to justifying holding him for trial\" (footnotes omitted)); Fallon &amp; Meltzer, Habeas Corpus Jurisdiction, Substantive Rights, and the War on Terror, 120 Harv. L.Rev.2029, 2102 (2007) (\"[T]he early practice was not consistent: courts occasionally permitted factual inquiries when no other opportunity for judicial review existed\").</p>\n<p>There is evidence from 19th-century American sources indicating that, even in States that accorded strong res judicata effect to prior adjudications, habeas courts in this country routinely allowed prisoners to introduce exculpatory evidence that was either unknown or previously unavailable to the prisoner. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ex parte Pattison,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Miss.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span>, 164 (1878) (noting that \"[w]hile the former adjudication must be considered as conclusive on the testimony then adduced\" \"newly developed exculpatory evidence ... may authorize the admission to bail\"); <i>Ex parte Foster,</i> 5 Tex.

Martin,</i> 7 N.Y. Leg. Obs. 49, 56 (1848) (\"If in custody on criminal process before indictment, the prisoner has an absolute right to demand that the original depositions be looked into to see whether any crime is in fact imputed to him, and the inquiry will by no means be confined to the return. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2268</span> Facts out of the return may be gone into to ascertain whether the committing magistrate may not have arrived at an illogical conclusion upon the evidence given before him ...\"); see generally (W. Church, Treatise on the Writ of Habeas Corpus \u00a7 182, p. 235 1886) (hereinafter Church) (noting that habeas courts would \"hear evidence anew if justice require it\"). Justice McLean, on Circuit in 1855, expressed his view that a habeas court should consider a prior judgment conclusive \"where there was clearly jurisdiction and a full and fair hearing; but that it might not be so considered when any of these requisites were wanting.\" <i>Ex parte Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></span>, 971, (No. 11,935) (CC Ohio 1855). To illustrate the circumstances in which the prior adjudication did not bind the habeas court, he gave the example of a case in which \"[s]everal unimpeached witnesses\" provided new evidence to exculpate the prisoner. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The idea that the necessary scope of habeas review in part depends upon the rigor of any earlier proceedings accords with our test for procedural adequacy in the due process context. See <i>Mathews v. Eldridge,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976) (noting that the Due Process Clause requires an assessment of, <i>inter alia,</i> \"the risk of an erroneous deprivation of [a liberty interest;] and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards\"). This principle has an established foundation in habeas corpus jurisprudence as well, as Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in <i>Ex parte Watkins,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span>, 7 L.Ed. 650 (1830), demonstrates. Like the petitioner in <i>Swain,</i> Watkins sought a writ of habeas corpus after being imprisoned pursuant to a judgment of a District of Columbia court. In holding that the judgment stood on \"high ground,\" 3 Pet., at 209, 7 L.Ed. 650, the Chief Justice emphasized the character of the court that rendered the original judgment, noting it was a \"court of record, having general jurisdiction over criminal cases.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 203. In contrast to \"inferior\" tribunals of limited jurisdiction, <i>ibid.,</i> courts of record had broad remedial powers, which gave the habeas court greater confidence in the judgment's validity. See generally Neuman, Habeas Corpus, Executive Detention, and the Removal of Aliens, 98 Colum. L.Rev. 961, 982-983 (1998).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, where relief is sought from a sentence that resulted from the judgment of a court of record, as was the case in <i>Watkins</i> and indeed in most federal habeas cases, considerable deference is owed to the court that ordered confinement. See <i>Brown v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105074\"><a href=\"/opinion/105074/brown-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 506, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.) (noting that a federal habeas court should accept a state court's factual findings unless \"a vital flaw be found in the process of ascertaining such facts in the State court\"). Likewise in those cases the prisoner should exhaust adequate alternative remedies before filing for the writ in federal court. See <i>Ex parte Royall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91598\"><a href=\"/opinion/91598/ex-parte-royall/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 251-252, 6 S.Ct. 734, 29 L.Ed. 868 (1886) (requiring exhaustion of state collateral processes). Both aspects of federal habeas corpus review are justified because it can be assumed that, in the usual course, a court of record provides defendants with a fair, adversary proceeding. In cases involving state convictions this framework also respects federalism; and in federal cases it has added justification because the prisoner already has had a chance to seek review of his conviction in a federal forum through a direct appeal. The present cases fall outside these categories, however; for here the detention is by executive order.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2269</span> Where a person is detained by executive order, rather than, say, after being tried and convicted in a court, the need for collateral review is most pressing. A criminal conviction in the usual course occurs after a judicial hearing before a tribunal disinterested in the outcome and committed to procedures designed to ensure its own independence. These dynamics are not inherent in executive detention orders or executive review procedures. In this context the need for habeas corpus is more urgent. The intended duration of the detention and the reasons for it bear upon the precise scope of the inquiry. Habeas corpus proceedings need not resemble a criminal trial, even when the detention is by executive order. But the writ must be effective. The habeas court must have sufficient authority to conduct a meaningful review of both the cause for detention and the Executive's power to detain.</p>\n<p>To determine the necessary scope of habeas corpus review, therefore, we must assess the CSRT process, the mechanism through which petitioners' designation as enemy combatants became final. Whether one characterizes the CSRT process as direct review of the Executive's battlefield determination that the detainee is an enemy combatant\u0097as the parties have and as we do\u0097or as the first step in the collateral review of a battlefield determination makes no difference in a proper analysis of whether the procedures Congress put in place are an adequate substitute for habeas corpus. What matters is the sum total of procedural protections afforded to the detainee at all stages, direct and collateral.</p>\n<p>Petitioners identify what they see as myriad deficiencies in the CSRTs. The most relevant for our purposes are the constraints upon the detainee's ability to rebut the factual basis for the Government's assertion that he is an enemy combatant. As already noted, see Part IV-C, <i>supra,</i> at the CSRT stage the detainee has limited means to find or present evidence to challenge the Government's case against him. He does not have the assistance of counsel and may not be aware of the most critical allegations that the Government relied upon to order his detention. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, at 156, \u00b6 F(8) (noting that the detainee can access only the \"unclassified portion of the Government Information\"). The detainee can confront witnesses that testify during the CSRT proceedings. <i>Id.,</i> at 144, \u00b6 <i>g</i> (8). But given that there are in effect no limits on the admission of hearsay evidence\u0097the only requirement is that the tribunal deem the evidence \"relevant and helpful,\" <i>ibid.,</i> \u00b6 <i>g</i> (9)\u0097the detainee's opportunity to question witnesses is likely to be more theoretical than real.</p>\n<p>The Government defends the CSRT process, arguing that it was designed to conform to the procedures suggested by the plurality in <i>Hamdi.</i> See 542 U.S., at 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633. Setting aside the fact that the relevant language in <i>Hamdi</i> did not garner a majority of the Court, it does not control the matter at hand. None of the parties in <i>Hamdi</i> argued there had been a suspension of the writ. Nor could they. The \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus process remained in place, <i>id.,</i> at 525, 124 S.Ct. 2633. Accordingly, the plurality concentrated on whether the Executive had the authority to detain and, if so, what rights the detainee had under the Due Process Clause. True, there are places in the <i>Hamdi</i> plurality opinion where it is difficult to tell where its extrapolation of \u00a7 2241 ends and its analysis of the petitioner's Due Process rights begins. But the Court had no occasion to define the necessary scope of habeas review, for Suspension Clause purposes, in the context of enemy combatant detentions. The closest the plurality came to doing so was in discussing whether, in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2270</span> light of separation-of-powers concerns, \u00a7 2241 should be construed to forbid the District Court from inquiring beyond the affidavit Hamdi's custodian provided in answer to the detainee's habeas petition. The plurality answered this question with an emphatic \"no.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 527, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (labeling this argument as \"extreme\"); <i>id.,</i> at 535-536, 124 S.Ct. 2633.</p>\n<p>Even if we were to assume that the CSRTs satisfy due process standards, it would not end our inquiry. Habeas corpus is a collateral process that exists, in Justice Holmes' words, to \"cu[t] through all forms and g[o] to the very tissue of the structure. It comes in from the outside, not in subordination to the proceedings, and although every form may have been preserved opens the inquiry whether they have been more than an empty shell.\" <i>Frank v. Mangum,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98441\"><a href=\"/opinion/98441/frank-v-mangum/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span>, 346, 35 S.Ct. 582, 59 L.Ed. 969 (1915) (dissenting opinion). Even when the procedures authorizing detention are structurally sound, the Suspension Clause remains applicable and the writ relevant. See 2 Chambers, Course of Lectures on English Law 1767-1773, at 6 (\"Liberty may be violated either by arbitrary <i>imprisonment</i> without law or the appearance of law, or by a lawful magistrate for an unlawful reason\"). This is so, as <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain</i> make clear, even where the prisoner is detained after a criminal trial conducted in full accordance with the protections of the Bill of Rights. Were this not the case, there would have been no reason for the Court to inquire into the adequacy of substitute habeas procedures in <i>Hayman</i> and <i>Swain.</i> That the prisoners were detained pursuant to the most rigorous proceedings imaginable, a full criminal trial, would have been enough to render any habeas substitute acceptable <i>per se.</i></p>\n<p>Although we make no judgment as to whether the CSRTs, as currently constituted, satisfy due process standards, we agree with petitioners that, even when all the parties involved in this process act with diligence and in good faith, there is considerable risk of error in the tribunal's findings of fact. This is a risk inherent in any process that, in the words of the former Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, is \"closed and accusatorial.\" See <i>Bismullah III,</i> 514 F.3d, at 1296 (Ginsburg, C. J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc). And given that the consequence of error may be detention of persons for the duration of hostilities that may last a generation or more, this is a risk too significant to ignore.</p>\n<p>For the writ of habeas corpus, or its substitute, to function as an effective and proper remedy in this context, the court that conducts the habeas proceeding must have the means to correct errors that occurred during the CSRT proceedings. This includes some authority to assess the sufficiency of the Government's evidence against the detainee. It also must have the authority to admit and consider relevant exculpatory evidence that was not introduced during the earlier proceeding. Federal habeas petitioners long have had the means to supplement the record on review, even in the postconviction habeas setting. See <i>Townsend v. Sain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106544\"><a href=\"/opinion/106544/townsend-v-sain/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span>, 313, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), overruled in part by <i>Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112728\"><a href=\"/opinion/112728/keeney-v-tamayo-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5, 112 S.Ct. 1715, 118 L.Ed.2d 318 (1992). Here that opportunity is constitutionally required.</p>\n<p>Consistent with the historic function and province of the writ, habeas corpus review may be more circumscribed if the underlying detention proceedings are more thorough than they were here. In two habeas cases involving enemy aliens tried for war crimes, <i>In re Yamashita,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104229\"><a href=\"/opinion/104229/in-re-yamashita/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 66 S.Ct. 340, 90 L.Ed. 499 (1946), and <i>Ex parte Quirin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087822\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087822/ex-parte-quirin/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 63 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2271</span> 2, 87 L.Ed. 3 (1942), for example, this Court limited its review to determining whether the Executive had legal authority to try the petitioners by military commission. See <i>Yamashita, supra,</i> at 8, 66 S.Ct. 340 (\"[O]n application for habeas corpus we are not concerned with the guilt or innocence of the petitioners. We consider here only the lawful power of the commission to try the petitioner for the offense charged\"); <i>Quirin, supra,</i> at 25, 63 S.Ct. 2 (\"We are not here concerned with any question of the guilt or innocence of petitioners\"). Military courts are not courts of record. See <i>Watkins,</i> 3 Pet., at 209; Church 513. And the procedures used to try General Yamashita have been sharply criticized by Members of this Court. See <i>Hamdan,</i> 548 U.S., at 617, 126 S.Ct. 2749; <i>Yamashita, supra,</i> at 41-81, 66 S.Ct. 340 (Rutledge, J., dissenting). We need not revisit these cases, however. For on their own terms, the proceedings in <i>Yamashita</i> and <i>Quirin,</i> like those in <i>Eisentrager,</i> had an adversarial structure that is lacking here. See <i>Yamashita, supra,</i> at 5, 66 S.Ct. 340 (noting that General Yamashita was represented by six military lawyers and that \"[t]hroughout the proceedings ... defense counsel ... demonstrated their professional skill and resourcefulness and their proper zeal for the defense with which they were charged\"); <i>Quirin, supra,</i> at 23-24, 63 S.Ct. 2; Exec. Order No. 9185, 7 Fed.Reg. 5103 (1942) (appointing counsel to represent the German saboteurs).</p>\n<p>The extent of the showing required of the Government in these cases is a matter to be determined. We need not explore it further at this stage. We do hold that when the judicial power to issue habeas corpus properly is invoked the judicial officer must have adequate authority to make a determination in light of the relevant law and facts and to formulate and issue appropriate orders for relief, including, if necessary, an order directing the prisoner's release.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>We now consider whether the DTA allows the Court of Appeals to conduct a proceeding meeting these standards. \"[W]e are obligated to construe the statute to avoid [constitutional] problems\" if it is \"`fairly possible'\" to do so. <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S., at 299-300, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (quoting <i>Crowell v. Benson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101864\"><a href=\"/opinion/101864/crowell-v-benson/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 62, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932)). There are limits to this principle, however. The canon of constitutional avoidance does not supplant traditional modes of statutory interpretation. See <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137741\"><a href=\"/opinion/137741/clark-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 385, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005) (\"The canon of constitutional avoidance comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction; and the canon functions as <i>a means of choosing between them</i>\"). We cannot ignore the text and purpose of a statute in order to save it.</p>\n<p>The DTA does not explicitly empower the Court of Appeals to order the applicant in a DTA review proceeding released should the court find that the standards and procedures used at his CSRT hearing were insufficient to justify detention. This is troubling. Yet, for present purposes, we can assume congressional silence permits a constitutionally required remedy. In that case it would be possible to hold that a remedy of release is impliedly provided for. The DTA might be read, furthermore, to allow the petitioners to assert most, if not all, of the legal claims they seek to advance, including their most basic claim: that the President has no authority under the AUMF to detain them indefinitely. (Whether the President has such authority turns on whether the AUMF <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2272</span> authorizes\u0097and the Constitution permits\u0097the indefinite detention of \"enemy combatants\" as the Department of Defense defines that term. Thus a challenge to the President's authority to detain is, in essence, a challenge to the Department's definition of enemy combatant, a \"standard\" used by the CSRTs in petitioners' cases.) At oral argument, the Solicitor General urged us to adopt both these constructions, if doing so would allow MCA \u00a7 7 to remain intact. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37, 53.</p>\n<p>The absence of a release remedy and specific language allowing AUMF challenges are not the only constitutional infirmities from which the statute potentially suffers, however. The more difficult question is whether the DTA permits the Court of Appeals to make requisite findings of fact. The DTA enables petitioners to request \"review\" of their CSRT determination in the Court of Appeals, DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(B)(i), 119 Stat. 2742; but the \"Scope of Review\" provision confines the Court of Appeals' role to reviewing whether the CSRT followed the \"standards and procedures\" issued by the Department of Defense and assessing whether those \"standards and procedures\" are lawful. \u00a7 1005(e)(C), <i>ibid.</i> Among these standards is \"the requirement that the conclusion of the Tribunal be supported by a preponderance of the evidence ... allowing a rebuttable presumption in favor of the Government's evidence.\" \u00a7 1005(e)(C)(i), <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Assuming the DTA can be construed to allow the Court of Appeals to review or correct the CSRT's factual determinations, as opposed to merely certifying that the tribunal applied the correct standard of proof, we see no way to construe the statute to allow what is also constitutionally required in this context: an opportunity for the detainee to present relevant exculpatory evidence that was not made part of the record in the earlier proceedings.</p>\n<p>On its face the statute allows the Court of Appeals to consider no evidence outside the CSRT record. In the parallel litigation, however, the Court of Appeals determined that the DTA allows it to order the production of all \"`reasonably available information in the possession of the U.S. Government bearing on the issue of whether the detainee meets the criteria to be designated as an enemy combatant,'\" regardless of whether this evidence was put before the CSRT. See <i>Bismullah I,</i> 501 F.3d, at 180. The Government, see Pet. for Cert. pending in <i>Gates v. Bismullah,</i> No. 07-1054 (hereinafter <i>Bismullah</i> Pet.), with support from five members of the Court of Appeals, see <i>Bismullah III,</i> 514 F.3d, at 1299 (Henderson, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); <i>id.,</i> at 1302 (opinion of Randolph, J.) (same); <i>id.,</i> at 1306 (opinion of Brown, J.) (same), disagrees with this interpretation. For present purposes, however, we can assume that the Court of Appeals was correct that the DTA allows introduction and consideration of relevant exculpatory evidence that was \"reasonably available\" to the Government at the time of the CSRT but not made part of the record. Even so, the DTA review proceeding falls short of being a constitutionally adequate substitute, for the detainee still would have no opportunity to present evidence discovered after the CSRT proceedings concluded.</p>\n<p>Under the DTA the Court of Appeals has the power to review CSRT determinations by assessing the legality of standards and procedures. This implies the power to inquire into what happened at the CSRT hearing and, perhaps, to remedy certain deficiencies in that proceeding. But should the Court of Appeals determine that the CSRT followed appropriate and lawful standards and procedures, it will <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2273</span> have reached the limits of its jurisdiction. There is no language in the DTA that can be construed to allow the Court of Appeals to admit and consider newly discovered evidence that could not have been made part of the CSRT record because it was unavailable to either the Government or the detainee when the CSRT made its findings. This evidence, however, may be critical to the detainee's argument that he is not an enemy combatant and there is no cause to detain him.</p>\n<p>This is not a remote hypothetical. One of the petitioners, Mohamed Nechla, requested at his CSRT hearing that the Government contact his employer. The petitioner claimed the employer would corroborate Nechla's contention he had no affiliation with al Qaeda. Although the CSRT determined this testimony would be relevant, it also found the witness was not reasonably available to testify at the time of the hearing. Petitioner's counsel, however, now represents the witness is available to be heard. See Brief for Boumediene Petitioners 5. If a detainee can present reasonably available evidence demonstrating there is no basis for his continued detention, he must have the opportunity to present this evidence to a habeas corpus court. Even under the Court of Appeals' generous construction of the DTA, however, the evidence identified by Nechla would be inadmissible in a DTA review proceeding. The role of an Article III court in the exercise of its habeas corpus function cannot be circumscribed in this manner.</p>\n<p>By foreclosing consideration of evidence not presented or reasonably available to the detainee at the CSRT proceedings, the DTA disadvantages the detainee by limiting the scope of collateral review to a record that may not be accurate or complete. In other contexts, <i>e.g.,</i> in post-trial habeas cases where the prisoner already has had a full and fair opportunity to develop the factual predicate of his claims, similar limitations on the scope of habeas review may be appropriate. See <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 436-437, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (noting that \u00a7 2254 \"does not equate prisoners who exercise diligence in pursuing their claims with those who do not\"). In this context, however, where the underlying detention proceedings lack the necessary adversarial character, the detainee cannot be held responsible for all deficiencies in the record.</p>\n<p>The Government does not make the alternative argument that the DTA allows for the introduction of previously unavailable exculpatory evidence on appeal. It does point out, however, that if a detainee obtains such evidence, he can request that the Deputy Secretary of Defense convene a new CSRT. See Supp. Brief for Respondents 4. Whatever the merits of this procedure, it is an insufficient replacement for the factual review these detainees are entitled to receive through habeas corpus. The Deputy Secretary's determination whether to initiate new proceedings is wholly a discretionary one. See Dept. of Defense, Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants, Instruction 5421.1, Procedure for Review of \"New Evidence\" Relating to Enemy Combatant (EC) Status \u00b6 5(d) (May 7, 2007) (Instruction 5421.1) (\"The decision to convene a CSRT to reconsider the basis of the detainee's [enemy combatant] status in light of `new evidence' is a matter vested in the unreviewable discretion of the [Deputy Secretary of Defense]\"). And we see no way to construe the DTA to allow a detainee to challenge the Deputy Secretary's decision not to open a new CSRT pursuant to Instruction 5421.1. Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to devise procedures for considering new evidence, see DTA \u00a7 1005(a)(3), but the detainee has no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2274</span> mechanism for ensuring that those procedures are followed. DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742, makes clear that the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction is \"limited to consideration of ... whether the status determination of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal with regard to such alien was consistent with the standards and procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense... and ... whether the use of such standards and procedures to make the determination is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(A), <i>ibid.,</i> further narrows the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction to reviewing \"any final decision of a Combatant Status Review Tribunal that an alien is properly detained as an enemy combatant.\" The Deputy Secretary's determination whether to convene a new CSRT is not a \"status determination of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal,\" much less a \"final decision\" of that body.</p>\n<p>We do not imply DTA review would be a constitutionally sufficient replacement for habeas corpus but for these limitations on the detainee's ability to present exculpatory evidence. For even if it were possible, as a textual matter, to read into the statute each of the necessary procedures we have identified, we could not overlook the cumulative effect of our doing so. To hold that the detainees at Guantanamo may, under the DTA, challenge the President's legal authority to detain them, contest the CSRT's findings of fact, supplement the record on review with exculpatory evidence, and request an order of release would come close to reinstating the \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus process Congress sought to deny them. The language of the statute, read in light of Congress' reasons for enacting it, cannot bear this interpretation. Petitioners have met their burden of establishing that the DTA review process is, on its face, an inadequate substitute for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p>Although we do not hold that an adequate substitute must duplicate \u00a7 2241 in all respects, it suffices that the Government has not established that the detainees' access to the statutory review provisions at issue is an adequate substitute for the writ of habeas corpus. MCA \u00a7 7 thus effects an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. In view of our holding we need not discuss the reach of the writ with respect to claims of unlawful conditions of treatment or confinement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In light of our conclusion that there is no jurisdictional bar to the District Court's entertaining petitioners' claims the question remains whether there are prudential barriers to habeas corpus review under these circumstances.</p>\n<p>The Government argues petitioners must seek review of their CSRT determinations in the Court of Appeals before they can proceed with their habeas corpus actions in the District Court. As noted earlier, in other contexts and for prudential reasons this Court has required exhaustion of alternative remedies before a prisoner can seek federal habeas relief. Most of these cases were brought by prisoners in state custody, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ex parte Royall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91598\"><a href=\"/opinion/91598/ex-parte-royall/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 6 S.Ct. 734, 29 L.Ed. 868, and thus involved federalism concerns that are not relevant here. But we have extended this rule to require defendants in courts-martial to exhaust their military appeals before proceeding with a federal habeas corpus action. See <i>Schlesinger,</i> 420 U.S., at 758, 95 S.Ct. 1300.</p>\n<p>The real risks, the real threats, of terrorist attacks are constant and not likely soon to abate. The ways to disrupt our life and laws are so many and unforeseen <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2275</span> that the Court should not attempt even some general catalogue of crises that might occur. Certain principles are apparent, however. Practical considerations and exigent circumstances inform the definition and reach of the law's writs, including habeas corpus. The cases and our tradition reflect this precept.</p>\n<p>In cases involving foreign citizens detained abroad by the Executive, it likely would be both an impractical and unprecedented extension of judicial power to assume that habeas corpus would be available at the moment the prisoner is taken into custody. If and when habeas corpus jurisdiction applies, as it does in these cases, then proper deference can be accorded to reasonable procedures for screening and initial detention under lawful and proper conditions of confinement and treatment for a reasonable period of time. Domestic exigencies, furthermore, might also impose such onerous burdens on the Government that here, too, the Judicial Branch would be required to devise sensible rules for staying habeas corpus proceedings until the Government can comply with its requirements in a responsible way. Cf. <i>Ex parte Milligan,</i> 4 Wall., at 127 (\"If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, <i>then,</i> on the theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course\"). Here, as is true with detainees apprehended abroad, a relevant consideration in determining the courts' role is whether there are suitable alternative processes in place to protect against the arbitrary exercise of governmental power.</p>\n<p>The cases before us, however, do not involve detainees who have been held for a short period of time while awaiting their CSRT determinations. Were that the case, or were it probable that the Court of Appeals could complete a prompt review of their applications, the case for requiring temporary abstention or exhaustion of alternative remedies would be much stronger. These qualifications no longer pertain here. In some of these cases six years have elapsed without the judicial oversight that habeas corpus or an adequate substitute demands. And there has been no showing that the Executive faces such onerous burdens that it cannot respond to habeas corpus actions. To require these detainees to complete DTA review before proceeding with their habeas corpus actions would be to require additional months, if not years, of delay. The first DTA review applications were filed over a year ago, but no decisions on the merits have been issued. While some delay in fashioning new procedures is unavoidable, the costs of delay can no longer be borne by those who are held in custody. The detainees in these cases are entitled to a prompt habeas corpus hearing.</p>\n<p>Our decision today holds only that the petitioners before us are entitled to seek the writ; that the DTA review procedures are an inadequate substitute for habeas corpus; and that the petitioners in these cases need not exhaust the review procedures in the Court of Appeals before proceeding with their habeas actions in the District Court. The only law we identify as unconstitutional is MCA \u00a7 7, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(e) (Supp.2007). Accordingly, both the DTA and the CSRT process remain intact. Our holding with regard to exhaustion should not be read to imply that a habeas court should intervene <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2276</span> the moment an enemy combatant steps foot in a territory where the writ runs. The Executive is entitled to a reasonable period of time to determine a detainee's status before a court entertains that detainee's habeas corpus petition. The CSRT process is the mechanism Congress and the President set up to deal with these issues. Except in cases of undue delay, federal courts should refrain from entertaining an enemy combatant's habeas corpus petition at least until after the Department, acting via the CSRT, has had a chance to review his status.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Although we hold that the DTA is not an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus, it does not follow that a habeas corpus court may disregard the dangers the detention in these cases was intended to prevent. <i>Felker, Swain,</i> and <i>Hayman</i> stand for the proposition that the Suspension Clause does not resist innovation in the field of habeas corpus. Certain accommodations can be made to reduce the burden habeas corpus proceedings will place on the military without impermissibly diluting the protections of the writ.</p>\n<p>In the DTA Congress sought to consolidate review of petitioners' claims in the Court of Appeals. Channeling future cases to one district court would no doubt reduce administrative burdens on the Government. This is a legitimate objective that might be advanced even without an amendment to \u00a7 2241. If, in a future case, a detainee files a habeas petition in another judicial district in which a proper respondent can be served, see <i>Rumsfeld v. Padilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136999\"><a href=\"/opinion/136999/rumsfeld-v-padilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, 435-436, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004), the Government can move for change of venue to the court that will hear these petitioners' cases, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a); <i>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108730\"><a href=\"/opinion/108730/braden-v-30th-judicial-circuit-court-of-ky/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span>, 499, n. 15, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973).</p>\n<p>Another of Congress' reasons for vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals, perhaps, was to avoid the widespread dissemination of classified information. The Government has raised similar concerns here and elsewhere. See Brief for Respondents 55-56; <i>Bismullah</i> Pet. 30. We make no attempt to anticipate all of the evidentiary and access-to-counsel issues that will arise during the course of the detainees' habeas corpus proceedings. We recognize, however, that the Government has a legitimate interest in protecting sources and methods of intelligence gathering; and we expect that the District Court will use its discretion to accommodate this interest to the greatest extent possible. Cf. <i>United States v. Reynolds,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105087\"><a href=\"/opinion/105087/united-states-v-reynolds/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10, 73 S.Ct. 528, 97 L.Ed. 727 (1953) (recognizing an evidentiary privilege in a civil damages case where \"there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged\").</p>\n<p>These and the other remaining questions are within the expertise and competence of the District Court to address in the first instance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>In considering both the procedural and substantive standards used to impose detention to prevent acts of terrorism, proper deference must be accorded to the political branches. See <i>United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102726\"><a href=\"/opinion/102726/united-states-v-curtiss-wright-export-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 320, 57 S.Ct. 216, 81 L.Ed. 255 (1936). Unlike the President and some designated Members of Congress, neither the Members of this Court nor most federal judges begin the day with briefings that may describe new and serious threats to our Nation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2277</span> and its people. The law must accord the Executive substantial authority to apprehend and detain those who pose a real danger to our security.</p>\n<p>Officials charged with daily operational responsibility for our security may consider a judicial discourse on the history of the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679 and like matters to be far removed from the Nation's present, urgent concerns. Established legal doctrine, however, must be consulted for its teaching. Remote in time it may be; irrelevant to the present it is not. Security depends upon a sophisticated intelligence apparatus and the ability of our Armed Forces to act and to interdict. There are further considerations, however. Security subsists, too, in fidelity to freedom's first principles. Chief among these are freedom from arbitrary and unlawful restraint and the personal liberty that is secured by adherence to the separation of powers. It is from these principles that the judicial authority to consider petitions for habeas corpus relief derives.</p>\n<p>Our opinion does not undermine the Executive's powers as Commander in Chief. On the contrary, the exercise of those powers is vindicated, not eroded, when confirmed by the Judicial Branch. Within the Constitution's separation-of-powers structure, few exercises of judicial power are as legitimate or as necessary as the responsibility to hear challenges to the authority of the Executive to imprison a person. Some of these petitioners have been in custody for six years with no definitive judicial determination as to the legality of their detention. Their access to the writ is a necessity to determine the lawfulness of their status, even if, in the end, they do not obtain the relief they seek.</p>\n<p>Because our Nation's past military conflicts have been of limited duration, it has been possible to leave the outer boundaries of war powers undefined. If, as some fear, terrorism continues to pose dangerous threats to us for years to come, the Court might not have this luxury. This result is not inevitable, however. The political branches, consistent with their independent obligations to interpret and uphold the Constitution, can engage in a genuine debate about how best to preserve constitutional values while protecting the Nation from terrorism. Cf. <i>Hamdan,</i> 548 U.S., at 636, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (BREYER, J., concurring) (\"[J]udicial insistence upon that consultation does not weaken our Nation's ability to deal with danger. To the contrary, that insistence strengthens the Nation's ability to determine\u0097through democratic means\u0097how best to do so\").</p>\n<p>It bears repeating that our opinion does not address the content of the law that governs petitioners' detention. That is a matter yet to be determined. We hold that petitioners may invoke the fundamental procedural protections of habeas corpus. The laws and Constitution are designed to survive, and remain in force, in extraordinary times. Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law. The Framers decided that habeas corpus, a right of first importance, must be a part of that framework, a part of that law.</p>\n<p>The determination by the Court of Appeals that the Suspension Clause and its protections are inapplicable to petitioners was in error. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The cases are remanded to the Court of Appeals with instructions that it remand the cases to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice GINSBURG and Justice BREYER join, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court's opinion in its entirety and add this afterword only to emphasize <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2278</span> two things one might overlook after reading the dissents.</p>\n<p>Four years ago, this Court in <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137000\"><a href=\"/opinion/137000/rasul-v-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004) held that statutory habeas jurisdiction extended to claims of foreign nationals imprisoned by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, \"to determine the legality of the Executive's potentially indefinite detention\" of them, <i>id.,</i> at 485, 124 S.Ct. 2686. Subsequent legislation eliminated the statutory habeas jurisdiction over these claims, so that now there must be constitutionally based jurisdiction or none at all. Justice SCALIA is thus correct that here, for the first time, this Court holds there is (he says \"confers\") constitutional habeas jurisdiction over aliens imprisoned by the military outside an area of <i>de jure</i> national sovereignty, see <i>post,</i> at 2293 (dissenting opinion). But no one who reads the Court's opinion in <i>Rasul</i> could seriously doubt that the jurisdictional question must be answered the same way in purely constitutional cases, given the Court's reliance on the historical background of habeas generally in answering the statutory question. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 542 U.S., at 473, 481-483, and nn. 11-14, 124 S.Ct. 2686. Indeed, the Court in <i>Rasul</i> directly answered the very historical question that Justice SCALIA says is dispositive, see <i>post,</i> at 2303; it wrote that \"[a]pplication of the habeas statute to persons detained at [Guantanamo] is consistent with the historical reach of the writ of habeas corpus,\" 542 U.S., at 481, 124 S.Ct. 2686. Justice SCALIA dismisses the statement as dictum, see <i>post,</i> at 2304-2305, but if dictum it was, it was dictum well considered, and it stated the view of five Members of this Court on the historical scope of the writ. Of course, it takes more than a quotation from <i>Rasul,</i> however much on point, to resolve the constitutional issue before us here, which the majority opinion has explored afresh in the detail it deserves. But whether one agrees or disagrees with today's decision, it is no bolt out of the blue.</p>\n<p>A second fact insufficiently appreciated by the dissents is the length of the disputed imprisonments, some of the prisoners represented here today having been locked up for six years, <i>ante,</i> at 2275-2276 (opinion of the Court). Hence the hollow ring when the dissenters suggest that the Court is somehow precipitating the judiciary into reviewing claims that the military (subject to appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit) could handle within some reasonable period of time. See, <i>e.g., post,</i> at 2280 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (\"[T]he Court should have declined to intervene until the D.C. Circuit had assessed the nature and validity of the congressionally mandated proceedings in a given detainee's case\"); <i>post,</i> at 2281 (\"[I]t is not necessary to consider the availability of the writ until the statutory remedies have been shown to be inadequate\"); <i>post,</i> at 2283 (\"[The Court] rushes to decide the fundamental question of the reach of habeas corpus when the functioning of the DTA may make that decision entirely unnecessary\"). These suggestions of judicial haste are all the more out of place given the Court's realistic acknowledgment that in periods of exigency the tempo of any habeas review must reflect the immediate peril facing the country. See <i>ante,</i> at 2274-2275.</p>\n<p>It is in fact the very lapse of four years from the time <i>Rasul</i> put everyone on notice that habeas process was available to Guantanamo prisoners, and the lapse of six years since some of these prisoners were captured and incarcerated, that stand at odds with the repeated suggestions of the dissenters that these cases should be seen as a judicial victory in a contest for power between the Court and the political branches. See <i>post,</i> at 2279, 2280, 2293 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting); <i>post,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2279</span> 2295-2296, 2296, 2302, 2303, 2306-2307 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The several answers to the charge of triumphalism might start with a basic fact of Anglo-American constitutional history: that the power, first of the Crown and now of the Executive Branch of the United States, is necessarily limited by habeas corpus jurisdiction to enquire into the legality of executive detention. And one could explain that in this Court's exercise of responsibility to preserve habeas corpus something much more significant is involved than pulling and hauling between the judicial and political branches. Instead, though, it is enough to repeat that some of these petitioners have spent six years behind bars. After six years of sustained executive detentions in Guantanamo, subject to habeas jurisdiction but without any actual habeas scrutiny, today's decision is no judicial victory, but an act of perseverance in trying to make habeas review, and the obligation of the courts to provide it, mean something of value both to prisoners and to the Nation. See <i>ante,</i> at 2277.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice SCALIA, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Today the Court strikes down as inadequate the most generous set of procedural protections ever afforded aliens detained by this country as enemy combatants. The political branches crafted these procedures amidst an ongoing military conflict, after much careful investigation and thorough debate. The Court rejects them today out of hand, without bothering to say what due process rights the detainees possess, without explaining how the statute fails to vindicate those rights, and before a single petitioner has even attempted to avail himself of the law's operation. And to what effect? The majority merely replaces a review system designed by the people's representatives with a set of shapeless procedures to be defined by federal courts at some future date. One cannot help but think, after surveying the modest practical results of the majority's ambitious opinion, that this decision is not really about the detainees at all, but about control of federal policy regarding enemy combatants.</p>\n<p>The majority is adamant that the Guantanamo detainees are entitled to the protections of habeas corpus\u0097its opinion begins by deciding that question. I regard the issue as a difficult one, primarily because of the unique and unusual jurisdictional status of Guantanamo Bay. I nonetheless agree with Justice SCALIA's analysis of our precedents and the pertinent history of the writ, and accordingly join his dissent. The important point for me, however, is that the Court should have resolved these cases on other grounds. Habeas is most fundamentally a procedural right, a mechanism for contesting the legality of executive detention. The critical threshold question in these cases, prior to any inquiry about the writ's scope, is whether the system the political branches designed protects whatever rights the detainees may possess. If so, there is no need for any additional process, whether called \"habeas\" or something else.</p>\n<p>Congress entrusted that threshold question in the first instance to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as the Constitution surely allows Congress to do. See Detainee Treatment Act of 2005(DTA), \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(A), 119 Stat. 2742. But before the D.C. Circuit has addressed the issue, the Court cashiers the statute, and without answering this critical threshold question itself. The Court does eventually get around to asking whether review under the DTA is, as the Court frames it, an \"adequate substitute\" for habeas, <i>ante,</i> at 2262, but even <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2280</span> then its opinion fails to determine what rights the detainees possess and whether the DTA system satisfies them. The majority instead compares the undefined DTA process to an equally undefined habeas right\u0097one that is to be given shape only in the future by district courts on a case-by-case basis. This whole approach is misguided.</p>\n<p>It is also fruitless. How the detainees' claims will be decided now that the DTA is gone is anybody's guess. But the habeas process the Court mandates will most likely end up looking a lot like the DTA system it replaces, as the district court judges shaping it will have to reconcile review of the prisoners' detention with the undoubted need to protect the American people from the terrorist threat\u0097precisely the challenge Congress undertook in drafting the DTA. All that today's opinion has done is shift responsibility for those sensitive foreign policy and national security decisions from the elected branches to the Federal Judiciary.</p>\n<p>I believe the system the political branches constructed adequately protects any constitutional rights aliens captured abroad and detained as enemy combatants may enjoy. I therefore would dismiss these cases on that ground. With all respect for the contrary views of the majority, I must dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Court's opinion makes plain that certiorari to review these cases should never have been granted. As two Members of today's majority once recognized, \"traditional rules governing our decision of constitutional questions and our practice of requiring the exhaustion of available remedies... make it appropriate to deny these petitions.\" <i>Boumediene v. Bush,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1725, 1727, 167 L.Ed.2d 757 (2007) (citation omitted) (statement of STEVENS and KENNEDY, JJ., respecting denial of certiorari). Just so. Given the posture in which these cases came to us, the Court should have declined to intervene until the D.C. Circuit had assessed the nature and validity of the congressionally mandated proceedings in a given detainee's case.</p>\n<p>The political branches created a two-part, collateral review procedure for testing the legality of the prisoners' detention: It begins with a hearing before a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) followed by review in the D.C. Circuit. As part of that review, Congress authorized the D.C. Circuit to decide whether the CSRT proceedings are consistent with \"the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742. No petitioner, however, has invoked the D.C. Circuit review the statute specifies. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186848\"><a href=\"/opinion/186848/boumediene-lakhdar-v-bush-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">981</span></a></span>, 994, and n. 16 (C.A.D.C.2007); Brief for Federal Respondents 41-43. As a consequence, that court has had no occasion to decide whether the CSRT hearings, followed by review in the Court of Appeals, vindicate whatever constitutional and statutory rights petitioners may possess. See 476 F.3d, at 994, and n. 16.</p>\n<p>Remarkably, this Court does not require petitioners to exhaust their remedies under the statute; it does not wait to see whether those remedies will prove sufficient to protect petitioners' rights. Instead, it not only denies the D.C. Circuit the opportunity to assess the statute's remedies, it refuses to do so itself: the majority expressly declines to decide whether the CSRT procedures, coupled with Article III review, satisfy due process. See <i>ante,</i> at 2269.</p>\n<p>It is grossly premature to pronounce on the detainees' right to habeas without first assessing whether the remedies the DTA system provides vindicate whatever rights <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2281</span> petitioners may claim. The plurality in <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137001\"><a href=\"/opinion/137001/hamdi-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 533, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004), explained that the Constitution guaranteed an American <i>citizen</i> challenging his detention as an enemy combatant the right to \"notice of the factual basis for his classification, and a fair opportunity to rebut the Government's factual assertions before a neutral decisionmaker.\" The plurality specifically stated that constitutionally adequate collateral process could be provided \"by an appropriately authorized and properly constituted military tribunal,\" given the \"uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 533, 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633. This point is directly pertinent here, for surely the Due Process Clause does not afford <i>non</i>-citizens in such circumstances greater protection than citizens are due.</p>\n<p>If the CSRT procedures meet the minimal due process requirements outlined in <i>Hamdi,</i> and if an Article III court is available to ensure that these procedures are followed in future cases, see <i>id.,</i> at 536, 124 S.Ct. 2633; <i>INS v.

Detainees will have received all the process the Constitution could possibly require, whether that process is called \"habeas\" or something else. The question of the writ's reach need not be addressed.</p>\n<p>This is why the Court should have required petitioners to exhaust their remedies under the statute. As we explained in <i>Gusik v.

The procedure established to police the errors of the tribunal whose judgment is challenged may be adequate for the occasion.\" Because the majority refuses to assess whether the CSRTs comport with the Constitution, it ends up razing a system of collateral review that it admits may in fact satisfy the Due Process Clause and be \"structurally sound.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2270. But if the collateral review procedures Congress has provided\u0097CSRT review coupled with Article III scrutiny\u0097are sound, interference by a federal habeas court may be entirely unnecessary.</p>\n<p>The only way to know is to require petitioners to use the alternative procedures Congress designed. Mandating that the petitioners exhaust their statutory remedies \"is in no sense a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. It is merely a deferment of resort to the writ until other corrective procedures are shown to be futile.\" <i>Gusik, supra,</i> at 132, 71 S.Ct. 149. So too here, it is not necessary to consider the availability of the writ until the statutory remedies have been shown to be inadequate to protect the detainees' rights. Cf. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A) (\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus ... shall not be granted unless it appears that ... the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State\"). Respect for the judgments of Congress\u0097 whose Members take the same oath we do to uphold the Constitution\u0097requires no less.</p>\n<p>In the absence of any assessment of the DTA's remedies, the question whether detainees are entitled to habeas is an entirely speculative one. Our precedents have long counseled us to avoid deciding such hypothetical questions of constitutional law. See <i>Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104029\"><a href=\"/opinion/104029/spector-motor-service-inc-v-mclaughlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 105, 65 S.Ct. 152, 89 L.Ed. 101 (1944) (\"If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2282</span> in the process of constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality ... unless such [questions are] unavoidable\"); see also <i>Ashwander v. TVA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102605\"><a href=\"/opinion/102605/ashwander-v-tva/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (Constitutional questions should not be decided unless \"`absolutely necessary to a decision of the case'\" (quoting <i>Burton v.

This is a \"fundamental rule of judicial restraint.\" <i>Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111191\"><a href=\"/opinion/111191/three-affiliated-tribes-of-fort-berthold-reservati/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 157, 104 S.Ct. 2267, 81 L.Ed.2d 113 (1984).</p>\n<p>The Court acknowledges that \"the ordinary course\" would be not to decide the constitutionality of the DTA at this stage, but abandons that \"ordinary course\" in light of the \"gravity\" of the constitutional issues presented and the prospect of additional delay. <i>Ante,</i> at 2263. It is, however, precisely when the issues presented are grave that adherence to the ordinary course is most important. A principle applied only when unimportant is not much of a principle at all, and charges of judicial activism are most effectively rebutted when courts can fairly argue they are following normal practices.</p>\n<p>The Court is also concerned that requiring petitioners to pursue \"DTA review before proceeding with their habeas corpus actions\" could involve additional delay. <i>Ante,</i> at 2275-2276. The nature of the habeas remedy the Court instructs lower courts to craft on remand, however, is far more unsettled than the process Congress provided in the DTA. See <i>ante,</i> at 2277 (\"[O]ur opinion does not address the content of the law that governs petitioners' detention. That is a matter yet to be determined\"). There is no reason to suppose that review according to procedures the Federal Judiciary will design, case by case, will proceed any faster than the DTA process petitioners disdained.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, the system the Court has launched (and directs lower courts to elaborate) promises to take longer. The Court assures us that before bringing their habeas petitions, detainees must usually complete the CSRT process. See <i>ante,</i> at 2275-2276. Then they may seek review in federal district court. Either success or failure there will surely result in an appeal to the D.C. Circuit\u0097exactly where judicial review <i>starts</i> under Congress's system. The effect of the Court's decision is to add additional layers of quite possibly redundant review. And because nobody knows how these new layers of \"habeas\" review will operate, or what new procedures they will require, their contours will undoubtedly be subject to fresh bouts of litigation. If the majority were truly concerned about delay, it would have required petitioners to use the DTA process that has been available to them for 2 1/2 years, with its Article III review in the D.C. Circuit. That system might well have provided petitioners all the relief to which they are entitled long before the Court's newly installed habeas review could hope to do so.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2283</span> The Court's refusal to require petitioners to exhaust the remedies provided by Congress violates the \"traditional rules governing our decision of constitutional questions.\" <i>Boumediene,</i> 549 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1727 (statement of STEVENS and KENNEDY, JJ., respecting denial of certiorari). The Court's disrespect for these rules makes its decision an awkward business. It rushes to decide the fundamental question of the reach of habeas corpus when the functioning of the DTA may make that decision entirely unnecessary, and it does so with scant idea of how DTA judicial review will actually operate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The majority's overreaching is particularly egregious given the weakness of its objections to the DTA. Simply put, the Court's opinion fails on its own terms. The majority strikes down the statute because it is not an \"adequate substitute\" for habeas review, <i>ante,</i> at 2262, but fails to show what rights the detainees have that cannot be vindicated by the DTA system.</p>\n<p>Because the central purpose of habeas corpus is to test the legality of executive detention, the writ requires most fundamentally an Article III court able to hear the prisoner's claims and, when necessary, order release. See <i>Brown v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105074\"><a href=\"/opinion/105074/brown-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 533, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring in result). Beyond that, the process a given prisoner is entitled to receive depends on the circumstances and the rights of the prisoner. See <i>Mathews v. Eldridge,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). After much hemming and hawing, the majority appears to concede that the DTA provides an Article III court competent to order release. See <i>ante,</i> at 2272-2273. The only issue in dispute is the process the Guantanamo prisoners are entitled to use to test the legality of their detention. <i>Hamdi</i> concluded that American citizens detained as enemy combatants are entitled to only limited process, and that much of that process could be supplied by a military tribunal, with review to follow in an Article III court. That is precisely the system we have here. It is adequate to vindicate whatever due process rights petitioners may have.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Court reaches the opposite conclusion partly because it misreads the statute. The majority appears not to understand how the review system it invalidates actually works\u0097specifically, how CSRT review and review by the D.C. Circuit fit together. After briefly acknowledging in its recitation of the facts that the Government designed the CSRTs \"to comply with the due process requirements identified by the plurality in <i>Hamdi,\" ante,</i> at 2241, the Court proceeds to dismiss the tribunal proceedings as no more than a suspect method used by the Executive for determining the status of the detainees in the first instance, see <i>ante,</i> at 2263. This leads the Court to treat the review the DTA provides in the D.C. Circuit as the only opportunity detainees have to challenge their status determination. See <i>ante,</i> at 2266.</p>\n<p>The Court attempts to explain its glancing treatment of the CSRTs by arguing that \"[w]hether one characterizes the CSRT process as direct review of the Executive's battlefield determination ... or as the first step in the collateral review of a battlefield determination makes no difference.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2269. First of all, the majority is quite wrong to dismiss the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2284</span> Executive's determination of detainee status as no more than a \"battlefield\" judgment, as if it were somehow provisional and made in great haste. In fact, detainees are designated \"enemy combatants\" only after \"multiple levels of review by military officers and officials of the Department of Defense.\" Memorandum of the Secretary of the Navy, Implementation of Combatant Status Review Tribunal Procedures for Enemy Combatants Detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (July 29, 2004), App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, p. 150 (hereinafter Implementation Memo).</p>\n<p>The majority is equally wrong to characterize the CSRTs as part of that initial determination process. They are instead a means for detainees to <i>challenge</i> the Government's determination. The Executive designed the CSRTs to mirror Army Regulation 190-8, see Brief for Federal Respondents 48, the very procedural model the plurality in <i>Hamdi</i> said provided the type of process an enemy combatant could expect from a habeas court, see 542 U.S., at 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (plurality opinion). The CSRTs operate much as habeas courts would if hearing the detainee's collateral challenge for the first time: They gather evidence, call witnesses, take testimony, and render a decision on the legality of the Government's detention. See Implementation Memo, App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, at 153-162. If the CSRT finds a particular detainee has been improperly held, it can order release. See <i>id.,</i> at 164.</p>\n<p>The majority insists that even if \"the CSRTs satisf[ied] due process standards,\" full habeas review would still be necessary, because habeas is a collateral remedy available even to prisoners \"detained pursuant to the most rigorous proceedings imaginable.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2269-2270, 2270. This comment makes sense only if the CSRTs are incorrectly viewed as a method used by the Executive for determining the prisoners' status, and not as themselves part of the collateral review to test the validity of that determination. See <i>Gusik,</i> 340 U.S., at 132, 71 S.Ct. 149. The majority can deprecate the importance of the CSRTs only by treating them as something they are not.</p>\n<p>The use of a military tribunal such as the CSRTs to review the aliens' detention should be familiar to this Court in light of the <i>Hamdi</i> plurality, which said that the due process rights enjoyed by <i>American citizens</i> detained as enemy combatants could be vindicated \"by an appropriately authorized and properly constituted military tribunal.\" 542 U.S., at 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633. The DTA represents Congress' considered attempt to provide the accused alien combatants detained at Guantanamo a constitutionally adequate opportunity to contest their detentions before just such a tribunal.</p>\n<p>But Congress went further in the DTA. CSRT review is just the first tier of collateral review in the DTA system. The statute provides additional review in an Article III court. Given the rationale of today's decision, it is well worth recalling exactly what the DTA provides in this respect. The statute directs the D.C. Circuit to consider whether a particular alien's status determination \"was consistent with the standards and procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense\" <i>and</i> \"whether the use of such standards and procedures to make the determination is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742. That is, a <i>court</i> determines whether the CSRT procedures are constitutional, and a <i>court</i> determines whether those procedures were followed in a particular case.</p>\n<p>In short, the <i>Hamdi</i> plurality concluded that this type of review would be enough <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2285</span> to satisfy due process, even for citizens. See 542 U.S., at 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633. Congress followed the Court's lead, only to find itself the victim of a constitutional bait and switch.</p>\n<p><i>Hamdi</i> merits scant attention from the Court\u0097a remarkable omission, as <i>Hamdi</i> bears directly on the issues before us. The majority attempts to dismiss <i>Hamdi'</i>s relevance by arguing that because the availability of \u00a7 2241 federal habeas was never in doubt in that case, \"the Court had no occasion to define the necessary scope of habeas review ... in the context of enemy combatant detentions.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2269. Hardly. <i>Hamdi</i> was all about the scope of habeas review in the context of enemy combatant detentions. The petitioner, an American citizen held within the United States as an enemy combatant, invoked the writ to challenge his detention. 542 U.S., at 510-511, 124 S.Ct. 2633. After \"a careful examination both of the writ... and of the Due Process Clause,\" this Court enunciated the \"basic process\" the Constitution entitled Hamdi to expect from a habeas court under \u00a7 2241. <i>Id.,</i> at 525, 534, 124 S.Ct. 2633. That process consisted of the right to \"receive notice of the factual basis for his classification, and a fair opportunity to rebut the Government's factual assertions before a neutral decisionmaker.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 533, 124 S.Ct. 2633. In light of the Government's national security responsibilities, the plurality found the process could be \"tailored to alleviate [the] uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.\" <i>Ibid.</i> For example, the Government could rely on hearsay and could claim a presumption in favor of its own evidence. See <i>id.,</i> at 533-534, 124 S.Ct. 2633.</p>\n<p><i>Hamdi</i> further suggested that this \"basic process\" on collateral review could be provided by a military tribunal. It pointed to prisoner-of-war tribunals as a model that would satisfy the Constitution's requirements. See <i>id.,</i> at 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633. Only \"[i]n the <i>absence</i> of such process\" before a military tribunal, the Court held, would Article III courts need to conduct full-dress habeas proceedings to \"ensure that the minimum requirements of due process are achieved.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). And even then, the petitioner would be entitled to no more process than he would have received from a properly constituted military review panel, given his limited due process rights and the Government's weighty interests. See <i>id.,</i> at 533-534, 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the majority, <i>Hamdi</i> is of pressing relevance because it establishes the procedures American <i>citizens</i> detained as enemy combatants can expect from a habeas court proceeding under \u00a7 2241. The DTA system of military tribunal hearings followed by Article III review looks a lot like the procedure <i>Hamdi</i> blessed. If nothing else, it is plain from the design of the DTA that Congress, the President, and this Nation's military leaders have made a good-faith effort to follow our precedent.</p>\n<p>The Court, however, will not take \"yes\" for an answer. The majority contends that \"[i]f Congress had envisioned DTA review as coextensive with traditional habeas corpus,\" it would have granted the D.C. Circuit far broader review authority. <i>Ante,</i> at 2265. Maybe so, but that comment reveals the majority's misunderstanding. \"[T]raditional habeas corpus\" takes <i>no</i> account of what <i>Hamdi</i> recognized as the \"uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.\" 542 U.S., at 533, 124 S.Ct. 2633. Besides, Congress and the Executive did not envision \"DTA review\"\u0097by which I assume the Court means D.C. Circuit review, see <i>ante,</i> at 2265-2266\u0097as the detainees' only opportunity to challenge their detentions. Instead, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2286</span> the political branches crafted CSRT <i>and</i> D.C. Circuit review to operate together, with the goal of providing noncitizen detainees the level of collateral process <i>Hamdi</i> said would satisfy the due process rights of American citizens. See Brief for Federal Respondents 48-53.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Given the statutory scheme the political branches adopted, and given <i>Hamdi,</i> it simply will not do for the majority to dismiss the CSRT procedures as \"far more limited\" than those used in military trials, and therefore beneath the level of process \"that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2260. The question is not how much process the CSRTs provide in comparison to other modes of adjudication. The question is whether the CSRT procedures\u0097coupled with the judicial review specified by the DTA\u0097provide the \"basic process\" <i>Hamdi</i> said the Constitution affords American citizens detained as enemy combatants. See 542 U.S., at 534, 124 S.Ct. 2633.</p>\n<p>By virtue of its refusal to allow the D.C. Circuit to assess petitioners' statutory remedies, and by virtue of its own refusal to consider, at the outset, the fit between those remedies and due process, the majority now finds itself in the position of evaluating whether the DTA system is an adequate substitute for habeas review without knowing what rights either habeas or the DTA is supposed to protect. The majority attempts to elide this problem by holding that petitioners have a right to habeas corpus and then comparing the DTA against the \"historic office\" of the writ. <i>Ante,</i> at 2265. But habeas is, as the majority acknowledges, a flexible remedy rather than a substantive right. Its \"precise application ... change[s] depending upon the circumstances.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2267. The shape of habeas review ultimately depends on the nature of the rights a petitioner may assert. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Reid v. Covert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105525\"><a href=\"/opinion/105525/reid-v-covert/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 75, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in result) (\"[T]he question of which specific safeguards of the Constitution are appropriately to be applied in a particular context ... can be reduced to the issue of what process is `due' a defendant in the particular circumstances of a particular case\").</p>\n<p>The scope of federal habeas review is traditionally more limited in some contexts than in others, depending on the status of the detainee and the rights he may assert. See <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S., at 306, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (\"In [immigration cases], other than the question whether there was some evidence to support the [deportation] order, the courts generally did not review factual determinations made by the Executive\" (footnote omitted)); <i>Burns v. Wilson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105148\"><a href=\"/opinion/105148/burns-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 139, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953) (plurality opinion) (\"[I]n military habeas corpus the inquiry, the scope of matters open for review, has always been more narrow than in civil cases\"); <i>In re Yamashita,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104229\"><a href=\"/opinion/104229/in-re-yamashita/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8, 66 S.Ct. 340, 90 L.Ed. 499 (1946) (\"The courts may inquire whether the detention complained of is within the authority of those detaining the petitioner. If the military tribunals have lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn, their action is not subject to judicial review\"); <i>Ex parte Quirin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087822\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087822/ex-parte-quirin/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 25, 63 S.Ct. 2, 87 L.Ed. 3 (1942) (federal habeas review of military commission verdict limited to determining commission's jurisdiction).</p>\n<p>Declaring that petitioners have a right to habeas in no way excuses the Court from explaining why the DTA does not protect whatever due process or statutory rights petitioners may have. Because if the DTA provides a means for vindicating petitioners' rights, it is necessarily an adequate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2287</span> substitute for habeas corpus. See <i>Swain v. Pressley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109623\"><a href=\"/opinion/109623/swain-v-pressley/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span>, 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977); <i>United States v.

It is worth noting again that the <i>Hamdi</i> controlling opinion said the Constitution guarantees citizen detainees only \"basic\" procedural rights, and that the process for securing those rights can \"be tailored to alleviate [the] uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.\" 542 U.S., at 533, 124 S.Ct. 2633. The majority, however, objects that \"the procedural protections afforded to the detainees in the CSRT hearings are ... limited.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2260. But the evidentiary and other limitations the Court complains of reflect the nature of the issue in contest, namely, the status of aliens captured by our Armed Forces abroad and alleged to be enemy combatants. Contrary to the repeated suggestions of the majority, DTA review need not parallel the habeas privileges enjoyed by noncombatant American citizens, as set out in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000 ed. and Supp V). Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 2264-2265. It need only provide process adequate for noncitizens detained as alleged combatants.</p>\n<p>To what basic process are these detainees due as habeas petitioners? We have said that \"at the absolute minimum,\" the Suspension Clause protects the writ \"`as it existed in 1789.'\" <i>St. Cyr, supra,</i> at 301, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (quoting <i>Felker v. Turpin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118058\"><a href=\"/opinion/118058/felker-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 663-664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996)). The majority admits that a number of historical authorities suggest that at the time of the Constitution's ratification, \"common-law courts abstained altogether from matters involving prisoners of war.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2248. If this is accurate, the process provided prisoners under the DTA is plainly more than sufficient\u0097it allows alleged combatants to challenge both the factual and legal bases of their detentions.</p>\n<p>Assuming the constitutional baseline is more robust, the DTA still provides adequate process, and by the majority's own standards. Today's Court opines that the Suspension Clause guarantees prisoners such as the detainees \"a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that [they are] being held pursuant to the erroneous application or interpretation of relevant law.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2266 (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, the Court holds that to be an adequate substitute, any tribunal reviewing the detainees' cases \"must have the power to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully detained.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The DTA system\u0097CSRT review of the Executive's determination followed by D.C. Circuit review for sufficiency of the evidence and the constitutionality of the CSRT process\u0097meets these criteria.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>At the CSRT stage, every petitioner has the right to present evidence that he has been wrongfully detained. This includes the right to call witnesses who are reasonably available, question witnesses called by the tribunal, introduce documentary evidence, and testify before the tribunal. See Implementation Memo, App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, at 154-156, 158-159, 161.</p>\n<p>While the Court concedes detainees may confront all witnesses called before the tribunal, it suggests this right is \"more theoretical than real\" because \"there are in effect no limits on the admission of hearsay evidence.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2269. The Court further complains that petitioners lack <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2288</span> \"the assistance of counsel,\" and\u0097given the limits on their access to classified information\u0097\"may not be aware of the most critical allegations\" against them. <i>Ante,</i> at 2269. None of these complaints is persuasive.</p>\n<p>Detainees not only have the opportunity to confront any witness who appears before the tribunal, they may call witnesses of their own. The Implementation Memo requires only that detainees' witnesses be \"reasonably available,\" App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, at 155, a requirement drawn from Army Regulation 190-8, ch. 1, \u00a7 1-6(<i>e</i> )(6), and entirely consistent with the Government's interest in avoiding \"a futile search for evidence\" that might burden warmaking responsibilities, <i>Hamdi, supra,</i> at 532, 124 S.Ct. 2633. The dangerous mission assigned to our forces abroad is to fight terrorists, not serve subpoenas. The Court is correct that some forms of hearsay evidence are admissible before the CSRT, but <i>Hamdi</i> expressly approved this use of hearsay by habeas courts. 542 U.S., at 533-534, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (\"Hearsay, for example, may need to be accepted as the most reliable available evidence from the Government\").</p>\n<p>As to classified information, while detainees are not permitted access to it themselves, the Implementation Memo provides each detainee with a \"Personal Representative\" who may review classified documents at the CSRT stage and summarize them for the detainee. Implementation Memo, <i>supra,</i> at 152, 154-155, 156; Brief for Federal Respondents 54-55. The prisoner's counsel enjoys the same privilege on appeal before the D.C. Circuit. That is more access to classified material for alleged alien enemy combatants than ever before provided. I am not aware of a single instance\u0097and certainly the majority cites none\u0097in which detainees such as petitioners have been provided access to classified material in <i>any</i> form. Indeed, prisoners of war who challenge their status determinations under the Geneva Convention are afforded no such access, see Army Regulation 190-8, ch. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1-6(<i>e</i>)(3) and (5), and the prisoner-of-war model is the one <i>Hamdi</i> cited as consistent with the demands of due process for <i>citizens,</i> see 542 U.S., at 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633.</p>\n<p>What alternative does the Court propose? Allow free access to classified information and ignore the risk the prisoner may eventually convey what he learns to parties hostile to this country, with deadly consequences for those who helped apprehend the detainee? If the Court can design a better system for communicating to detainees the substance of any classified information relevant to their cases, without fatally compromising national security interests and sources, the majority should come forward with it. Instead, the majority fobs that vexing question off on district courts to answer down the road.</p>\n<p>Prisoners of war are not permitted access to classified information, and neither are they permitted access to counsel, another supposed failing of the CSRT process. And yet the Guantanamo detainees are hardly denied all legal assistance. They are provided a \"Personal Representative\" who, as previously noted, may access classified information, help the detainee arrange for witnesses, assist the detainee's preparation of his case, and even aid the detainee in presenting his evidence to the tribunal. See Implementation Memo, <i>supra,</i> at 161. The provision for a personal representative on this order is one of several ways in which the CSRT procedures are <i>more</i> generous than those provided prisoners of war under Army Regulation 190-8.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that all this is just at the CSRT stage. Detainees receive additional process before the D.C. Circuit, including <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2289</span> full access to appellate counsel and the right to challenge the factual and legal bases of their detentions. DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C) empowers the Court of Appeals to determine not only whether the CSRT observed the \"procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense,\" but also \"whether the use of such standards and procedures ... is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" 119 Stat. 2742. These provisions permit detainees to dispute the sufficiency of the evidence against them. They allow detainees to challenge a CSRT panel's interpretation of any relevant law, and even the constitutionality of the CSRT proceedings themselves. This includes, as the Solicitor General acknowledges, the ability to dispute the Government's right to detain alleged combatants in the first place, and to dispute the Government's definition of \"enemy combatant.\" Brief for Federal Respondents 59. All this before an Article III court\u0097plainly a neutral decisionmaker.</p>\n<p>All told, the DTA provides the prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay adequate opportunity to contest the bases of their detentions, which is all habeas corpus need allow. The DTA provides more opportunity and more process, in fact, than that afforded prisoners of war or any other alleged enemy combatants in history.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>Despite these guarantees, the Court finds the DTA system an inadequate habeas substitute, for one central reason: Detainees are unable to introduce at the appeal stage exculpatory evidence discovered after the conclusion of their CSRT proceedings. See <i>ante,</i> at 2271. The Court hints darkly that the DTA may suffer from other infirmities, see <i>ante,</i> at 2274 (\"We do not imply DTA review would be a constitutionally sufficient replacement for habeas corpus but for these limitations on the detainee's ability to present exculpatory evidence\"), but it does not bother to name them, making a response a bit difficult. As it stands, I can only assume the Court regards the supposed defect it did identify as the gravest of the lot.</p>\n<p>If this is the most the Court can muster, the ice beneath its feet is thin indeed. As noted, the CSRT procedures provide ample opportunity for detainees to introduce exculpatory evidence\u0097whether documentary in nature or from live witnesses\u0097before the military tribunals. See <i>infra,</i> at 2289-2291; Implementation Memo, App. J to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-196, at 155-156. And if their ability to introduce such evidence is denied contrary to the Constitution or laws of the United States, the D.C. Circuit has the authority to say so on review.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Court asks us to imagine an instance in which evidence is discovered <i>after</i> the CSRT panel renders its decision, but <i>before</i> the Court of Appeals reviews the detainee's case. This scenario, which of course has not yet come to pass as no review in the D.C. Circuit has occurred, provides no basis for rejecting the DTA as a habeas substitute. While the majority is correct that the DTA does not contemplate the introduction of \"newly discovered\" evidence before the Court of Appeals, petitioners and the Solicitor General agree that the DTA <i>does</i> permit the D.C. Circuit to remand a detainee's case for a new CSRT determination. Brief for Petitioner Boumediene et al. in No. 06-1195, at 30; Brief for Federal Respondents 60-61. In the event a detainee alleges that he has obtained new and persuasive exculpatory evidence that would have been considered by the tribunal below had it only been available, the D.C. Circuit could readily remand the case to the tribunal to allow that body to consider the evidence in the first instance. The Court of Appeals could <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2290</span> later review any new or reinstated decision in light of the supplemented record.</p>\n<p>If that sort of procedure sounds familiar, it should. Federal appellate courts reviewing factual determinations follow just such a procedure in a variety of circumstances. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. White,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1446782\"><a href=\"/opinion/1446782/united-states-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span>, 413 (C.A.6 2007) (remanding new-evidence claim to the district court for a <i>Brady</i> evidentiary hearing); <i>Avila v.

The DTA expressly directs the Secretary of Defense to \"provide for periodic review of any new evidence that may become available relating to the enemy combatant status of a detainee.\" DTA \u00a7 1005(a)(3). Regulations issued by the Department of Defense provide that when a detainee puts forward new, material evidence \"not previously presented to the detainee's CSRT,\" the Deputy Secretary of Defense \"`will direct that a CSRT convene to reconsider the basis of the detainee's ... status in light of the new information.'\" Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants, Instruction 5421.1, Procedure for Review of \"New Evidence\" Relating to Enemy Combatant (EC) Status \u00b6\u00b6 4(a)(1), 5(b) (May 7, 2007); Brief for Federal Respondents 56, n. 30. Pursuant to DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(A), the resulting CSRT determination is again reviewable in full by the D.C. Circuit.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition, DTA \u00a7 1005(d)(1) further requires the Department of Defense to conduct a yearly review of the status of each prisoner. See 119 Stat. 2741. The Deputy Secretary of Defense has promulgated concomitant regulations establishing an Administrative Review Board to assess \"annually the need to continue to detain each enemy combatant.\" Deputy Secretary of Defense Order OSD 06942-04 (May 11, 2004), App. K to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, p. 189. In the words of the implementing order, the purpose of this annual review is to afford every detainee the opportunity \"to explain why he is no longer a threat to the United States\" and should be released. <i>Ibid.</i> The Board's findings are forwarded to a presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed civilian within the Department of Defense whom the Secretary of Defense has designated to administer the review process. This designated civilian official has the authority to order release upon the Board's recommendation. <i>Id.,</i> at 201.</p>\n<p>The Court's hand wringing over the DTA's treatment of later-discovered exculpatory evidence is the most it has to show after a roving search for constitutionally problematic scenarios. But \"[t]he delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional,\" we have said, \"is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.\" <i>United States v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2291</span> <i>Raines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106008\"><a href=\"/opinion/106008/united-states-v-james-griggs-raines/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 22, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960). The Court today invents a sort of reverse facial challenge and applies it with gusto: If there is <i>any</i> scenario in which the statute <i>might</i> be constitutionally infirm, the law must be struck down. Cf. <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987) (\"A facial challenge ... must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid\"); see also <i>Washington v. Glucksberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118144\"><a href=\"/opinion/118144/washington-v-glucksberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span>, 739-740, and n. 7, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgments) (facial challenge must fail where the statute has \"`plainly legitimate sweep'\" (quoting <i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108858\"><a href=\"/opinion/108858/broadrick-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973))). The Court's new method of constitutional adjudication only underscores its failure to follow our usual procedures and require petitioners to demonstrate that <i>they</i> have been harmed by the statute they challenge. In the absence of such a concrete showing, the Court is unable to imagine a plausible hypothetical in which the DTA is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E</h2>\n<p>The Court's second criterion for an adequate substitute is the \"power to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully detained.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2266. As the Court basically admits, the DTA can be read to permit the D.C. Circuit to order release in light of our traditional principles of construing statutes to avoid difficult constitutional issues, when reasonably possible. See <i>ante,</i> at 2270-2271.</p>\n<p>The Solicitor General concedes that remedial authority of some sort must be implied in the statute, given that the DTA \u0097 like the general habeas law itself, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243 \u0097 provides no express remedy of any kind. Brief for Federal Respondents 60-61. The parties agree that at the least, the DTA empowers the D.C. Circuit to remand a prisoner's case to the CSRT with instructions to perform a new status assessment. Brief for Petitioner Boumediene et al. in No. 06-1195, at 30; Brief for Federal Respondents 60-61. To avoid constitutional infirmity, it is reasonable to imply more, see <i>Ashwander,</i> 297 U.S., at 348, 56 S.Ct. 466 (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\"When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question ... it is a cardinal principle that this Court will... ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the [constitutional] question may be avoided\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S., at 299-300, 121 S.Ct. 2271, especially in view of the Solicitor General's concession at oral argument and in his Supplemental Brief that authority to release might be read in the statute, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 37; Supplemental Brief for Federal Respondents 9.</p>\n<p>The Court grudgingly suggests that \"Congress' silence on the question of remedies suggests acquiescence to any constitutionally required remedy.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2271. But the argument in favor of statutorily authorized release is stronger than that. The DTA's parallels to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243 on this score are noteworthy. By way of remedy, the general federal habeas statute provides only that the court, having heard and determined the facts, shall \"dispose of the matter as law and justice require.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We have long held, and no party here disputes, that this includes the power to order release. See <i>Wilkinson v. Dotson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142877\"><a href=\"/opinion/142877/wilkinson-v-dotson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 79, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005) (\"[T]he writ's history makes clear that it traditionally has been accepted as the specific instrument to obtain release from [unlawful] confinement\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2292</span> The DTA can be similarly read. Because Congress substituted DTA review for habeas corpus and because the \"unique purpose\" of the writ is \"to release the applicant ... from unlawful confinement,\" <i>Allen v. McCurry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 98, n. 12, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980), DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2) can and should be read to confer on the Court of Appeals the authority to order release in appropriate circumstances. Section 1005(e)(2)(D) plainly contemplates release, addressing the effect \"release of [an] alien from the custody of the Department of Defense\" will have on the jurisdiction of the court. 119 Stat. 2742-2743. This reading avoids serious constitutional difficulty and is consistent with the text of the statute.</p>\n<p>The D.C. Circuit can thus order release, the CSRTs can order release, and the head of the Administrative Review Boards can, at the recommendation of those panels, order release. These multiple release provisions within the DTA system more than satisfy the majority's requirement that any tribunal substituting for a habeas court have the authority to release the prisoner.</p>\n<p>The basis for the Court's contrary conclusion is summed up in the following sentence near the end of its opinion: \"To hold that the detainees at Guantanamo may, under the DTA, challenge the President's legal authority to detain them, contest the CSRT's findings of fact, supplement the record on review with newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence, and request an order of release would come close to reinstating the \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus process Congress sought to deny them.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2271. In other words, any interpretation of the statute that would make it an adequate substitute for habeas must be rejected, because Congress could not possibly have intended to enact an adequate substitute for habeas. The Court could have saved itself a lot of trouble if it had simply announced this Catch-22 approach at the beginning rather than the end of its opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>For all its eloquence about the detainees' right to the writ, the Court makes no effort to elaborate how exactly the remedy it prescribes will differ from the procedural protections detainees enjoy under the DTA. The Court objects to the detainees' limited access to witnesses and classified material, but proposes no alternatives of its own. Indeed, it simply ignores the many difficult questions its holding presents. What, for example, will become of the CSRT process? The majority says federal courts should <i>generally</i> refrain from entertaining detainee challenges until after the petitioner's CSRT proceeding has finished. See <i>ante,</i> at 2275-2276 (\"[e]xcept in cases of undue delay\"). But to what deference, if any, is that CSRT determination entitled?</p>\n<p>There are other problems. Take witness availability. What makes the majority think witnesses will become magically available when the review procedure is labeled \"habeas\"? Will the location of most of these witnesses change \u0097 will they suddenly become easily susceptible to service of process? Or will subpoenas issued by American habeas courts run to Basra? And if they did, how would they be enforced? Speaking of witnesses, will detainees be able to call active-duty military officers as witnesses? If not, why not?</p>\n<p>The majority has no answers for these difficulties. What it does say leaves open the distinct possibility that its \"habeas\" remedy will, when all is said and done, end up looking a great deal like the DTA review it rejects. See <i>ante,</i> at 2275-2276 (opinion of the court) (\"We recognize, however, that the Government has a legitimate interest in protecting sources and methods <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2293</span> of intelligence gathering, and we expect that the District Court will use its discretion to accommodate this interest to the greatest extent possible\"). But \"[t]he role of the judiciary is limited to determining whether the procedures meet the essential standard of fairness under the Due Process Clause and does not extend to imposing procedures that merely displace congressional choices of policy.\" <i>Landon v. Plasencia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087737\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087737/landon-v-plasencia/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 34-35, 103 S.Ct. 321, 74 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982).</p>\n<p>The majority rests its decision on abstract and hypothetical concerns. Step back and consider what, in the real world, Congress and the Executive have actually granted aliens captured by our Armed Forces overseas and found to be enemy combatants:</p>\n<blockquote>\u0095 The right to hear the bases of the charges against them, including a summary of any classified evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u0095 The ability to challenge the bases of their detention before military tribunals modeled after Geneva Convention procedures. Some 38 detainees have been released as a result of this process. Brief for Federal Respondents 57, 60.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u0095 The right, before the CSRT, to testify, introduce evidence, call witnesses, question those the Government calls, and secure release, if and when appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u0095 The right to the aid of a personal representative in arranging and presenting their cases before a CSRT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u0095 Before the D.C. Circuit, the right to employ counsel, challenge the factual record, contest the lower tribunal's legal determinations, ensure compliance with the Constitution and laws, and secure release, if any errors below establish their entitlement to such relief.</blockquote>\n<p>In sum, the DTA satisfies the majority's own criteria for assessing adequacy. This statutory scheme provides the combatants held at Guantanamo greater procedural protections than have ever been afforded alleged enemy detainees \u0097 whether citizens or aliens \u0097 in our national history.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>So who has won? Not the detainees. The Court's analysis leaves them with only the prospect of further litigation to determine the content of their new habeas right, followed by further litigation to resolve their particular cases, followed by further litigation before the D.C. Circuit \u0097 where they could have started had they invoked the DTA procedure. Not Congress, whose attempt to \"determine \u0097 through democratic means \u0097 how best\" to balance the security of the American people with the detainees' liberty interests, see <i>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145625\"><a href=\"/opinion/145625/hamdan-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span>, 636, 126 S.Ct. 2749, 165 L.Ed.2d 723 (2006) (BREYER, J., concurring), has been unceremoniously brushed aside. Not the Great Writ, whose majesty is hardly enhanced by its extension to a jurisdictionally quirky outpost, with no tangible benefit to anyone. Not the rule of law, unless by that is meant the rule of lawyers, who will now arguably have a greater role than military and intelligence officials in shaping policy for alien enemy combatants. And certainly not the American people, who today lose a bit more control over the conduct of this Nation's foreign policy to unelected, politically unaccountable judges.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Today, for the first time in our Nation's history, the Court confers a constitutional right to habeas corpus on alien enemies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2294</span> detained abroad by our military forces in the course of an ongoing war. THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent, which I join, shows that the procedures prescribed by Congress in the Detainee Treatment Act provide the essential protections that habeas corpus guarantees; there has thus been no suspension of the writ, and no basis exists for judicial intervention beyond what the Act allows. My problem with today's opinion is more fundamental still: The writ of habeas corpus does not, and never has, run in favor of aliens abroad; the Suspension Clause thus has no application, and the Court's intervention in this military matter is entirely <i>ultra vires.</i></p>\n<p>I shall devote most of what will be a lengthy opinion to the legal errors contained in the opinion of the Court. Contrary to my usual practice, however, I think it appropriate to begin with a description of the disastrous consequences of what the Court has done today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>America is at war with radical Islamists. The enemy began by killing Americans and American allies abroad: 241 at the Marine barracks in Lebanon, 19 at the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, 224 at our embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, and 17 on the USS Cole in Yemen. See National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, The 9/11 Commission Report, pp. 60-61, 70, 190 (2004). On September 11, 2001, the enemy brought the battle to American soil, killing 2,749 at the Twin Towers in New York City, 184 at the Pentagon in Washington, D. C., and 40 in Pennsylvania. See <i>id.,</i> at 552, n. 9. It has threatened further attacks against our homeland; one need only walk about buttressed and barricaded Washington, or board a plane anywhere in the country, to know that the threat is a serious one. Our Armed Forces are now in the field against the enemy, in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last week, 13 of our countrymen in arms were killed.</p>\n<p>The game of bait-and-switch that today's opinion plays upon the Nation's Commander in Chief will make the war harder on us. It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed. That consequence would be tolerable if necessary to preserve a time-honored legal principle vital to our constitutional Republic. But it is this Court's blatant <i>abandonment</i> of such a principle that produces the decision today. The President relied on our settled precedent in <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104813\"><a href=\"/opinion/104813/johnson-v-eisentrager/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span>, 70 S.Ct. 936, 94 L.Ed. 1255 (1950), when he established the prison at Guantanamo Bay for enemy aliens. Citing that case, the President's Office of Legal Counsel advised him \"that the great weight of legal authority indicates that a federal district court could not properly exercise habeas jurisdiction over an alien detained at [Guantanamo Bay].\" Memorandum from Patrick F. Philbin and John C. Yoo, Deputy Assistant Attorneys General, Office of Legal Counsel, to William J. Haynes II, General Counsel, Dept. of Defense (Dec. 28, 2001). Had the law been otherwise, the military surely would not have transported prisoners there, but would have kept them in Afghanistan, transferred them to another of our foreign military bases, or turned them over to allies for detention. Those other facilities might well have been worse for the detainees themselves.</p>\n<p>In the long term, then, the Court's decision today accomplishes little, except perhaps to reduce the well-being of enemy combatants that the Court ostensibly seeks to protect. In the short term, however, the decision is devastating. At least 30 of those prisoners hitherto released from Guantanamo Bay have returned to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2295</span> the battlefield. See S.Rep. No. 110-90, pt. 7, p. 13 (2007) (Minority Views of Sens. Kyl, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, and Coburn) (hereinafter Minority Report). Some have been captured or killed. See <i>ibid.;</i> see also Mintz, Released Detainees Rejoining the Fight, Washington Post, Oct. 22, 2004, pp. A1, A12. But others have succeeded in carrying on their atrocities against innocent civilians. In one case, a detainee released from Guantanamo Bay masterminded the kidnapping of two Chinese dam workers, one of whom was later shot to death when used as a human shield against Pakistani commandoes. See Khan &amp; Lancaster, Pakistanis Rescue Hostage; 2nd Dies, Washington Post, Oct. 15, 2004, p. A18. Another former detainee promptly resumed his post as a senior Taliban commander and murdered a United Nations engineer and three Afghan soldiers. Mintz, <i>supra.</i> Still another murdered an Afghan judge. See Minority Report 13. It was reported only last month that a released detainee carried out a suicide bombing against Iraqi soldiers in Mosul, Iraq. See White, Ex-Guantanamo Detainee Joined Iraq Suicide Attack, Washington Post, May 8, 2008, p. A18.</p>\n<p>These, mind you, were detainees whom <i>the military</i> had concluded were not enemy combatants. Their return to the kill illustrates the incredible difficulty of assessing who is and who is not an enemy combatant in a foreign theater of operations where the environment does not lend itself to rigorous evidence collection. Astoundingly, the Court today raises the bar, requiring military officials to appear before civilian courts and defend their decisions under procedural and evidentiary rules that go beyond what Congress has specified. As THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent makes clear, we have no idea what those procedural and evidentiary rules are, but they will be determined by civil courts and (in the Court's contemplation at least) will be more detainee-friendly than those now applied, since otherwise there would no reason to hold the congressionally prescribed procedures unconstitutional. If they impose a higher standard of proof (from foreign battlefields) than the current procedures require, the number of the enemy returned to combat will obviously increase.</p>\n<p>But even when the military has evidence that it can bring forward, it is often foolhardy to release that evidence to the attorneys representing our enemies. And one escalation of procedures that the Court <i>is</i> clear about is affording the detainees increased access to witnesses (perhaps troops serving in Afghanistan?) and to classified information. See <i>ante,</i> at 2269-2270. During the 1995 prosecution of Omar Abdel Rahman, federal prosecutors gave the names of 200 unindicted co-conspirators to the \"Blind Sheik's\" defense lawyers; that information was in the hands of Osama Bin Laden within two weeks. See Minority Report 14-15. In another case, trial testimony revealed to the enemy that the United States had been monitoring their cellular network, whereupon they promptly stopped using it, enabling more of them to evade capture and continue their atrocities. See <i>id.,</i> at 15.</p>\n<p>And today it is not just the military that the Court elbows aside. A mere two Terms ago in <i>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145625\"><a href=\"/opinion/145625/hamdan-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span>, 126 S.Ct. 2749, 165 L.Ed.2d 723 (2006), when the Court held (quite amazingly) that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 had not stripped habeas jurisdiction over Guantanamo petitioners' claims, four Members of today's five-Justice majority joined an opinion saying the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Nothing prevents the President from returning to Congress to seek the authority [for trial by military commission] he believes necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2296</span> \"Where, as here, no emergency prevents consultation with Congress, judicial insistence upon that consultation does not weaken our Nation's ability to deal with danger. To the contrary, that insistence strengthens the Nation's ability to determine \u0097 through democratic means \u0097 how best to do so. The Constitution places its faith in those democratic means.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 636, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (BREYER, J., concurring).<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Turns out they were just kidding. For in response, Congress, at the President's request, quickly enacted the Military Commissions Act, emphatically reasserting that it did not want these prisoners filing habeas petitions. It is therefore clear that Congress and the Executive \u0097 <i>both</i> political branches \u0097 have determined that limiting the role of civilian courts in adjudicating whether prisoners captured abroad are properly detained is important to success in the war that some 190,000 of our men and women are now fighting. As the Solicitor General argued, \"the Military Commissions Act and the Detainee Treatment Act ... represent an effort by the political branches to strike an appropriate balance between the need to preserve liberty and the need to accommodate the weighty and sensitive governmental interests in ensuring that those who have in fact fought with the enemy during a war do not return to battle against the United States.\" Brief for Respondents 10-11 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>But it does not matter. The Court today decrees that no good reason to accept the judgment of the other two branches is \"apparent.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2261. \"The Government,\" it declares, \"presents no credible arguments that the military mission at Guantanamo would be compromised if habeas corpus courts had jurisdiction to hear the detainees' claims.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 2260-2261. What competence does the Court have to second-guess the judgment of Congress and the President on such a point? None whatever. But the Court blunders in nonetheless. Henceforth, as today's opinion makes unnervingly clear, how to handle enemy prisoners in this war will ultimately lie with the branch that knows least about the national security concerns that the subject entails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Suspension Clause of the Constitution provides: \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. As a court of law operating under a written Constitution, our role is to determine whether there is a conflict between that Clause and the Military Commissions Act. A conflict arises only if the Suspension Clause preserves the privilege of the writ for aliens held by the United States military as enemy combatants at the base in Guantanamo Bay, located within the sovereign territory of Cuba.</p>\n<p>We have frequently stated that we owe great deference to Congress's view that a law it has passed is constitutional. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Department of Labor v. Triplett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112399\"><a href=\"/opinion/112399/department-of-labor-v-triplett/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 721, 110 S.Ct. 1428, 108 L.Ed.2d 701 (1990); <i>United States v.

Douds,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104790\"><a href=\"/opinion/104790/american-communications-assn-v-douds/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 435, 70 S.Ct. 674, 94 L.Ed. 925 (1950) (Jackson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). That is especially so in the area of foreign and military affairs; \"perhaps in no other area has the Court accorded Congress greater deference.\" <i>Rostker v. Goldberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110548\"><a href=\"/opinion/110548/rostker-v-goldberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 64-65, 101 S.Ct. 2646, 69 L.Ed.2d 478 (1981). Indeed, we accord great deference even when the President acts alone in this area. See <i>Department of Navy v. Egan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111990\"><a href=\"/opinion/111990/department-of-navy-v-egan/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 529-530, 108 S.Ct. 818, 98 L.Ed.2d 918 (1988); <i>Regan v.

The writ as preserved in the Constitution could not possibly extend farther than the common law provided when that Clause was written. See Part III, <i>infra.</i> The Court admits that it cannot determine whether the writ historically extended to aliens held abroad, and it concedes (necessarily) that Guantanamo Bay lies outside the sovereign territory of the United States. See <i>ante,</i> at 2251-2252; <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137000\"><a href=\"/opinion/137000/rasul-v-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 500-501, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Together, these two concessions establish that it is (in the Court's view) perfectly ambiguous whether the common-law writ would have provided a remedy for these petitioners. If that is so, the Court has no basis to strike down the Military Commissions Act, and must leave undisturbed the considered judgment of the coequal branches.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>How, then, does the Court weave a clear constitutional prohibition out of pure interpretive equipoise? The Court resorts to \"fundamental separation-of-powers principles\" to interpret the Suspension Clause. <i>Ante,</i> at 2253. According to the Court, because \"the writ of habeas corpus is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers,\" the test of its extraterritorial reach \"must not be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to restrain.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2259.</p>\n<p>That approach distorts the nature of the separation of powers and its role in the constitutional structure. The \"fundamental separation-of-powers principles\" that the Constitution embodies are to be derived not from some judicially imagined matrix, but from the sum total of the individual separation-of-powers provisions that the Constitution sets forth. Only by considering them one-by-one does the full shape of the <i>Constitution's</i> separation-of-powers principles emerge. It is nonsensical to interpret those provisions themselves in light of some general \"separation-of-powers principles\" dreamed up by the Court. Rather, they must be interpreted to mean what they were understood to mean when the people ratified them. And if the understood scope of the writ of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2298</span> habeas corpus was \"designed to restrain\" (as the Court says) the actions of the Executive, the understood <i>limits</i> upon that scope were (as the Court seems not to grasp) just as much \"designed to restrain\" the incursions of the Third Branch. \"Manipulation\" of the territorial reach of the writ by the Judiciary poses just as much a threat to the proper separation of powers as \"manipulation\" by the Executive. As I will show below, manipulation is what is afoot here. The understood limits upon the writ deny our jurisdiction over the habeas petitions brought by these enemy aliens, and entrust the President with the crucial wartime determinations about their status and continued confinement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court purports to derive from our precedents a \"functional\" test for the extraterritorial reach of the writ, <i>ante,</i> at 2258, which shows that the Military Commissions Act unconstitutionally restricts the scope of habeas. That is remarkable because the most pertinent of those precedents, <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104813\"><a href=\"/opinion/104813/johnson-v-eisentrager/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span>, 70 S.Ct. 936, 94 L.Ed. 1255, conclusively establishes the opposite. There we were confronted with the claims of 21 Germans held at Landsberg Prison, an American military facility located in the American Zone of occupation in postwar Germany. They had been captured in China, and an American military commission sitting there had convicted them of war crimes \u0097 collaborating with the Japanese after Germany's surrender. <i>Id.,</i> at 765-766, 70 S.Ct. 936. Like the petitioners here, the Germans claimed that their detentions violated the Constitution and international law, and sought a writ of habeas corpus. Writing for the Court, Justice Jackson held that American courts lacked habeas jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We are cited to <i>[sic]</i> no instance where a court, in this or any other country where the writ is known, has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction. Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 768, 70 S.Ct. 936.</blockquote>\n<p>Justice Jackson then elaborated on the historical scope of the writ:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The alien, to whom the United States has been traditionally hospitable, has been accorded a generous and ascending scale of rights as he increases his identity with our society ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"But, in extending constitutional protections beyond the citizenry, the Court has been at pains to point out that it was the alien's presence within its territorial jurisdiction that gave the Judiciary power to act.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 770-771, 70 S.Ct. 936.</blockquote>\n<p>Lest there be any doubt about the primacy of territorial sovereignty in determining the jurisdiction of a habeas court over an alien, Justice Jackson distinguished two cases in which aliens had been permitted to seek habeas relief, on the ground that the prisoners in those cases were in custody within the sovereign territory of the United States. <i>Id.,</i> at 779-780, 70 S.Ct. 936 (discussing <i>Ex parte Quirin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087822\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087822/ex-parte-quirin/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 63 S.Ct. 1, 87 L.Ed. 3 (1942), and <i>In re Yamashita,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104229\"><a href=\"/opinion/104229/in-re-yamashita/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 66 S.Ct. 340, 90 L.Ed. 499 (1946)). \"By reason of our sovereignty at that time over [the Philippines],\" Jackson wrote, \"Yamashita stood much as did Quirin before American courts.\" 339 U.S., at 780, 70 S.Ct. 936.</p>\n<p><i>Eisentrager</i> thus held \u0097 <i>held</i> beyond any doubt \u0097 that the Constitution does not ensure habeas for aliens held by the United <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2299</span> States in areas over which our Government is not sovereign.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court would have us believe that <i>Eisentrager</i> rested on \"[p]ractical considerations,\" such as the \"difficulties of ordering the Government to produce the prisoners in a habeas corpus proceeding.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2257. Formal sovereignty, says the Court, is merely one consideration \"that bears upon which constitutional guarantees apply\" in a given location. <i>Ante,</i> at 2258. This is a sheer rewriting of the case. <i>Eisentrager</i> mentioned practical concerns, to be sure \u0097 but not for the purpose of determining <i>under what circumstances</i> American courts could issue writs of habeas corpus for aliens abroad. It cited them to support <i>its holding</i> that the Constitution does not empower courts to issue writs of habeas corpus to aliens abroad <i>in any circumstances.</i> As Justice Black accurately said in dissent, \"the Court's opinion inescapably denies courts power to afford the least bit of protection for any alien who is subject to our occupation government abroad, even if he is neither enemy nor belligerent and even after peace is officially declared.\" 339 U.S., at 796, 70 S.Ct. 936.</p>\n<p>The Court also tries to change <i>Eisentrager</i> into a \"functional\" test by quoting a paragraph that lists the characteristics of the German petitioners:</p>\n<blockquote>\"To support [the] assumption [of a constitutional right to habeas corpus] we must hold that a prisoner of our military authorities is constitutionally entitled to the writ, even though he (a) is an enemy alien; (b) has never been or resided in the United States; (c) was captured outside of our territory and there held in military custody as a prisoner of war; (d) was tried and convicted by a Military Commission sitting outside the United States; (e) for offenses against laws of war committed outside the United States; (f) and is at all times imprisoned outside the United States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 777, 70 S.Ct. 936 (quoted in part, <i>ante,</i> at 2259).</blockquote>\n<p>But that paragraph is introduced by a sentence stating that \"[t]he foregoing demonstrates <i>how much further we must go</i> if we are to invest these enemy aliens, resident, captured and imprisoned abroad, with standing to demand access to our courts.\" 339 U.S., at 777, 70 S.Ct. 936 (emphasis added). How much further than <i>what</i>? Further than the rule set <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2300</span> forth in the prior section of the opinion, which said that \"in extending constitutional protections beyond the citizenry, the Court has been at pains to point out that it was the alien's presence within its territorial jurisdiction that gave the Judiciary power to act.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 771, 70 S.Ct. 936. In other words, the characteristics of the German prisoners were set forth, not in application of some \"functional\" test, but to show that the case before the Court represented an <i>a fortiori</i> application of the ordinary rule. That is reaffirmed by the sentences that immediately follow the listing of the Germans' characteristics:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We have pointed out that the privilege of litigation has been extended to aliens, whether friendly or enemy, only because permitting their presence in the country implied protection. No such basis can be invoked here, for these prisoners at no relevant time were within any territory over which the United States is sovereign, and the scenes of their offense, their capture, their trial and their punishment were all beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 777-778, 70 S.Ct. 936.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Eisentrager</i> nowhere mentions a \"functional\" test, and the notion that it is based upon such a principle is patently false.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court also reasons that <i>Eisentrager</i> must be read as a \"functional\" opinion because of our prior decisions in the Insular Cases. See <i>ante,</i> at 2253-2255. It cites our statement in <i>Balzac v. Porto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99954\"><a href=\"/opinion/99954/balzac-v-porto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 312, 42 S.Ct. 343, 66 L.Ed. 627 (1922), that \"`the real issue in the <i>Insular Cases</i> was not whether the Constitution extended to the Philippines or Porto Rico when we went there, but which of its provisions were applicable by way of limitation upon the exercise of executive and legislative power in dealing with new conditions and requirements.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2254-2255. But the Court conveniently omits <i>Balzac</i>'s predicate to that statement: \"The Constitution of the United States is in force in Porto Rico as it is wherever and whenever the <i>sovereign power</i> of that government is exerted.\" 258 U.S., at 312, 42 S.Ct. 343 (emphasis added). The Insular Cases all concerned territories acquired by Congress under its Article IV authority and indisputably part of the sovereign territory of the United States. See <i>United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112382\"><a href=\"/opinion/112382/united-states-v-verdugo-urquidez/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 268, 110 S.Ct. 1056, 108 L.Ed.2d 222 (1990); <i>Reid v. Covert,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2301</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105525\"><a href=\"/opinion/105525/reid-v-covert/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 13, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957) (plurality opinion of Black, J.). None of the Insular Cases stands for the proposition that aliens located outside U.S. sovereign territory have constitutional rights, and <i>Eisentrager</i> held just the opposite with respect to habeas corpus. As I have said, <i>Eisentrager</i> distinguished <i>Yamashita</i> on the ground of \"our sovereignty [over the Philippines],\" 339 U.S., at 780, 70 S.Ct. 936.</p>\n<p>The Court also relies on the \"[p]ractical considerations\" that influenced our decision in <i>Reid v. Covert, supra</i><i>.</i> See <i>ante,</i> at 2255-2257. But all the Justices in the majority except Justice Frankfurter limited their analysis to the rights of <i>citizens</i> abroad. See <i>Reid, supra,</i> at 5-6, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (plurality opinion of Black, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 74-75, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (Harlan, J., concurring in result). (Frankfurter limited his analysis to the even narrower class of civilian dependents of American military personnel abroad, see <i>id.,</i> at 45, 77 S.Ct. 1222 (opinion concurring in result).) In trying to wring some kind of support out of <i>Reid</i> for today's novel holding, the Court resorts to a chain of logic that does not hold. The members of the <i>Reid</i> majority, the Court says, were divided over whether <i>In re Ross,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93107\"><a href=\"/opinion/93107/in-re-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 11 S.Ct. 897, 35 L.Ed. 581 (1891), which had (according to the Court) held that under certain circumstances American citizens abroad do not have indictment and jury-trial rights, should be overruled. In the Court's view, the <i>Reid</i> plurality would have overruled <i>Ross,</i> but Justices Frankfurter and Harlan preferred to distinguish it. The upshot: \"If citizenship had been the only relevant factor in the case, it would have been necessary for the Court to overturn <i>Ross,</i> something Justices Harlan and Frankfurter were unwilling to do.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2257. What, exactly, is this point supposed to prove? To say that \"practical considerations\" determine the precise content of the constitutional protections American citizens enjoy when they are abroad is quite different from saying that \"practical considerations\" determine whether aliens abroad enjoy any constitutional protections whatever, including habeas. In other words, merely because citizenship is not a <i>sufficient</i> factor to extend constitutional rights abroad does not mean that it is not a <i>necessary</i> one.</p>\n<p>The Court tries to reconcile <i>Eisentrager</i> with its holding today by pointing out that in postwar Germany, the United States was \"answerable to its Allies\" and did not \"pla[n] a long-term occupation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2260, 2260. Those factors were not mentioned in <i>Eisentrager.</i> Worse still, it is impossible to see how they relate to the Court's asserted purpose in creating this \"functional\" test \u0097 namely, to ensure a judicial inquiry into detention and prevent the political branches from acting with impunity. Can it possibly be that the Court trusts the political branches more when they are beholden to foreign powers than when they act alone?</p>\n<p>After transforming the <i>a fortiori</i> elements discussed above into a \"functional\" test, the Court is still left with the difficulty that most of those elements exist here as well with regard to all the detainees. To make the application of the newly crafted \"functional\" test produce a different result in the present cases, the Court must rely upon factors (d) and (e): The Germans had been tried by a military commission for violations of the laws of war; the present petitioners, by contrast, have been tried by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) whose procedural protections, according to the Court's <i>ipse dixit,</i> \"fall well short of the procedures and adversarial mechanisms that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2260. But no one looking for \"functional\" equivalents would put <i>Eisentrager</i> and the present cases in the same category, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2302</span> much less place the present cases in a preferred category. The difference between them cries out for lesser procedures in the present cases. The prisoners in <i>Eisentrager</i> were <i>prosecuted</i> for crimes after the cessation of hostilities; the prisoners here are enemy combatants <i>detained</i> during an ongoing conflict. See <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137001\"><a href=\"/opinion/137001/hamdi-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 538, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004) (plurality opinion) (suggesting, as an adequate substitute for habeas corpus, the use of a tribunal akin to a CSRT to authorize the detention of <i>American citizens</i> as enemy combatants during the course of the present conflict).</p>\n<p>The category of prisoner comparable to these detainees are not the <i>Eisentrager</i> criminal defendants, but the more than 400,000 prisoners of war detained in the United States alone during World War II. Not a single one was accorded the right to have his detention validated by a habeas corpus action in federal court \u0097 and that despite the fact that they were present on U.S. soil. See Bradley, The Military Commissions Act, Habeas Corpus, and the Geneva Conventions, 101 Am. J. Int'l L. 322, 338 (2007). The Court's analysis produces a crazy result: Whereas those convicted and sentenced to death for war crimes are without judicial remedy, all enemy combatants detained during a war, at least insofar as they are confined in an area away from the battlefield over which the United States exercises \"absolute and indefinite\" control, may seek a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. And, as an even more bizarre implication from the Court's reasoning, those prisoners whom the military plans to try by full-dress Commission at a future date may file habeas petitions and secure release before their trials take place.</p>\n<p>There is simply no support for the Court's assertion that constitutional rights extend to aliens held outside U.S. sovereign territory, see <i>Verdugo-Urquidez,</i> 494 U.S., at 271, 110 S.Ct. 1056, and <i>Eisentrager</i> could not be clearer that the privilege of habeas corpus does not extend to aliens abroad. By blatantly distorting <i>Eisentrager,</i> the Court avoids the difficulty of explaining why it should be overruled. See <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112786\"><a href=\"/opinion/112786/planned-parenthood-of-southeastern-pa-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, 854-855, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992) (identifying <i>stare decisis</i> factors). The rule that aliens abroad are not constitutionally entitled to habeas corpus has not proved unworkable in practice; if anything, it is the Court's \"functional\" test that does not (and never will) provide clear guidance for the future. <i>Eisentrager</i> forms a coherent whole with the accepted proposition that aliens abroad have no substantive rights under our Constitution. Since it was announced, no relevant factual premises have changed. It has engendered considerable reliance on the part of our military. And, as the Court acknowledges, text and history do not clearly compel a contrary ruling. It is a sad day for the rule of law when such an important constitutional precedent is discarded without an <i>apologia,</i> much less an apology.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>What drives today's decision is neither the meaning of the Suspension Clause, nor the principles of our precedents, but rather an inflated notion of judicial supremacy. The Court says that if the extraterritorial applicability of the Suspension Clause turned on formal notions of sovereignty, \"it would be possible for the political branches to govern without legal constraint\" in areas beyond the sovereign territory of the United States. <i>Ante,</i> at 2258-2259. That cannot be, the Court says, because it is the duty of this Court to say what the law is. <i>Id.,</i> at 2258-2259. It would be difficult to imagine a more <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2303</span> question-begging analysis. \"The very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies <i>properly before them.</i>\" <i>United States v. Raines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106008\"><a href=\"/opinion/106008/united-states-v-james-griggs-raines/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 20-21, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960) (citing <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803); emphasis added). Our power \"to say what the law is\" is circumscribed by the limits of our statutorily and constitutionally conferred jurisdiction. See <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 573-578, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). And that is precisely the question in these cases: whether the Constitution confers habeas jurisdiction on federal courts to decide petitioners' claims. It is both irrational and arrogant to say that the answer must be yes, because otherwise we would not be supreme.</p>\n<p>But so long as there are <i>some</i> places to which habeas does not run \u0097 so long as the Court's new \"functional\" test will not be satisfied <i>in every case</i> \u0097 then there will be circumstances in which \"it would be possible for the political branches to govern without legal constraint.\" Or, to put it more impartially, areas in which the legal determinations of the <i>other</i> branches will be (shudder!) <i>supreme.</i> In other words, judicial supremacy is not really assured by the constitutional rule that the Court creates. The gap between rationale and rule leads me to conclude that the Court's ultimate, unexpressed goal is to preserve the power to review the confinement of enemy prisoners held by the Executive anywhere in the world. The \"functional\" test usefully evades the precedential landmine of <i>Eisentrager</i> but is so inherently subjective that it clears a wide path for the Court to traverse in the years to come.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Putting aside the conclusive precedent of <i>Eisentrager,</i> it is clear that the original understanding of the Suspension Clause was that habeas corpus was not available to aliens abroad, as Judge Randolph's thorough opinion for the court below detailed. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186848\"><a href=\"/opinion/186848/boumediene-lakhdar-v-bush-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">981</span></a></span>, 988-990 (C.A.D.C.2007).</p>\n<p>The Suspension Clause reads: \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. The proper course of constitutional interpretation is to give the text the meaning it was understood to have at the time of its adoption by the people. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). That course is especially demanded when (as here) the Constitution limits the power of Congress to infringe upon a pre-existing common-law right. The nature of the writ of habeas corpus that cannot be suspended must be defined by the common-law writ that was available at the time of the founding. See <i>McNally v. Hill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102317\"><a href=\"/opinion/102317/mcnally-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span>, 135-136, 55 S.Ct. 24, 79 L.Ed. 238 (1934); see also <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span>, 342, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); <i>D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v.

To be sure, the writ had an \"extraordinary territorial ambit,\" because it was a so-called \"prerogative writ,\" which, unlike other writs, could extend beyond the realm of England to other places where the Crown was sovereign. R. Sharpe, The Law of Habeas Corpus 188 (2d ed.1989) (hereinafter Sharpe); see also Note on the Power of the English Courts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2304</span> to Issue the Writ of Habeas to Places Within the Dominions of the Crown, But Out of England, and On the Position of Scotland in Relation to that Power, 8 Jurid. Rev. 157 (1896) (hereinafter Note on Habeas); <i>King v. Cowle,</i> 2 Burr. 834, 855-856, 97 Eng. Rep. 587, 599 (K.B.1759).</p>\n<p>But prerogative writs could not issue to foreign countries, even for British subjects; they were confined to the King's dominions \u0097 those areas over which the Crown was sovereign. See Sharpe 188; 2 R. Chambers, A Course of Lectures on the English Law 1767-1773, pp. 7-8 (Curley ed.1986); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 131 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone). Thus, the writ has never extended to Scotland, which, although united to England when James I succeeded to the English throne in 1603, was considered a foreign dominion under a different Crown \u0097 that of the King of Scotland. Sharpe 191; Note on Habeas 158.<sup>[5]</sup> That is why Lord Mansfield wrote that \"[t]o foreign dominions, which belong to a prince who succeeds to the throne of England, this Court has no power to send any writ of any kind. We cannot send a habeas corpus to Scotland....\" <i>Cowle, supra,</i> at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 599-600.</p>\n<p>The common-law writ was codified by the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, which \"stood alongside Magna Charta and the English Bill of Rights of 1689 as a towering common law lighthouse of liberty \u0097 a beacon by which framing lawyers in America consciously steered their course.\" Amar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84 Geo. L.J. 641, 663 (1996). The writ was established in the Colonies beginning in the 1690's and at least one colony adopted the 1679 Act almost verbatim. See Dept. of Political Science, Okla. State Univ., Research Reports, No. 1, R. Walker, The American Reception of the Writ of Liberty 12-16 (1961). Section XI of the Act stated where the writ could run. It \"may be directed and run into any county palatine, the cinque-ports, or other privileged places within the kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed, and the islands of Jersey or Guernsey.\" 31 Car. 2, ch. 2. The cinque-ports and county palatine were so-called \"exempt jurisdictions\" \u0097 franchises granted by the Crown in which local authorities would manage municipal affairs, including the court system, but over which the Crown maintained ultimate sovereignty. See 3 Blackstone 78-79. The other places listed \u0097 Wales, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Jersey, and Guernsey \u0097 were territories of the Crown even though not part England proper. See <i>Cowle, supra,</i> at 853-854, 97 Eng. Rep., at 598 (Wales and Berwick-upon-Tweed); 1 Blackstone 104 (Jersey and Guernsey); Sharpe 192 (same).</p>\n<p>The Act did not extend the writ elsewhere, even though the existence of other places to which British prisoners could be sent was recognized by the Act. The possibility of evading judicial review through such spiriting-away was eliminated, not by expanding the writ abroad, but by forbidding (in Article XII of the Act) the shipment of prisoners to places where the writ did not run or where its execution would be difficult. See 31 Car. 2, ch. 2; see generally Nutting, The Most Wholesome Law \u0097 The Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 65 Am. Hist. Rev. 527 (1960).</p>\n<p>The Habeas Corpus Act, then, confirms the consensus view of scholars and jurists that the writ did not run outside the sovereign territory of the Crown. The Court says that the idea that \"jurisdiction followed the King's officers\" is an equally <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2305</span> credible view. <i>Ante,</i> at 2248. It is not credible at all. The only support the Court cites for it is a page in Boumediene's brief, which in turn cites this Court's dicta in <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 482, 124 S.Ct. 2686, mischaracterizing Lord Mansfield's statement that the writ ran to any place that was \"under the subjection of the Crown,\" <i>Cowle, supra,</i> at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 599. It is clear that Lord Mansfield was saying that the writ extended outside the realm of England proper, not outside the sovereign territory of the Crown.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court dismisses the example of Scotland on the grounds that Scotland had its own judicial system and that the writ could not, as a practical matter, have been enforced there. <i>Ante,</i> at 2250. Those explanations are totally unpersuasive. The existence of a separate court system was never a basis for denying the power of a court to issue the writ. See 9 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 124 (3d ed.1944) (citing <i>Ex parte Anderson,</i> 3 El. and El. 487 (1861)). And as for logistical problems, the same difficulties were present for places like the Channel Islands, where the writ did run. The Court attempts to draw an analogy between the prudential limitations on issuing the writ to such remote areas within the sovereign territory of the Crown and the jurisdictional prohibition on issuing the writ to Scotland. See <i>ante,</i> at 2249-2250. But the very authority that the Court cites, Lord Mansfield, expressly distinguished between these two concepts, stating that English courts had the \"power\" to send the writ to places within the Crown's sovereignty, the \"only question\" being the \"propriety,\" while they had \"no power to send any writ of any kind\" to Scotland and other \"foreign dominions.\" <i>Cowle, supra,</i> at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 599-600. The writ did not run to Scotland because, even after the Union, \"Scotland remained a foreign dominion of the prince who succeeded to the English throne,\" and \"union did not extend the prerogative of the English crown to Scotland.\" Sharpe 191; see also Sir Matthew Hale's The Prerogatives of the King 19 (D. Yale ed.1976).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, <i>all</i> available historical evidence points to the conclusion that the writ would not have been available at common law for aliens captured and held outside the sovereign territory of the Crown. Despite three opening briefs, three reply briefs, and support from a legion of <i>amici,</i> petitioners have failed to identify a single case in the history of Anglo-American law that supports their claim to jurisdiction. The Court finds it significant that there is no recorded case <i>denying</i> jurisdiction to such prisoners either. See <i>ante,</i> at 2250-2251. But a case standing for the remarkable proposition that the writ could issue to a foreign land would surely have been reported, whereas a case denying such a writ for lack of jurisdiction would likely not. At a minimum, the absence of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2306</span> reported case either way leaves unrefuted the voluminous commentary stating that habeas was confined to the dominions of the Crown.</p>\n<p>What history teaches is confirmed by the nature of the limitations that the Constitution places upon suspension of the common-law writ. It can be suspended only \"in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion.\" Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. The latter case (invasion) is plainly limited to the territory of the United States; and while it is conceivable that a rebellion could be mounted by American citizens abroad, surely the overwhelming majority of its occurrences would be domestic. If the extraterritorial scope of habeas turned on flexible, \"functional\" considerations, as the Court holds, why would the Constitution limit its suspension almost entirely to instances of domestic crisis? Surely there is an even greater justification for suspension in foreign lands where the United States might hold prisoners of war during an ongoing conflict. And correspondingly, there is less threat to liberty when the Government suspends the writ's (supposed) application in foreign lands, where even on the most extreme view prisoners are entitled to fewer constitutional rights. It makes no sense, therefore, for the Constitution generally to forbid suspension of the writ abroad if indeed the writ has application there.</p>\n<p>It may be objected that the foregoing analysis proves too much, since this Court has already suggested that the writ of habeas corpus <i>does</i> run abroad for the benefit of United States citizens. \"[T]he position that United States citizens throughout the world may be entitled to habeas corpus rights ... is precisely the position that this Court adopted in <i>Eisentrager,</i> see 339 U.S., at 769-770, 70 S.Ct. 936, even while holding that aliens abroad did not have habeas corpus rights.\" <i>Rasul,</i> 542 U.S., at 501, 502, 124 S.Ct. 2686 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted). The reason for that divergence is not difficult to discern. The common-law writ, as received into the law of the new constitutional Republic, took on such changes as were demanded by a system in which rule is derived from the consent of the governed, and in which citizens (not \"subjects\") are afforded defined protections against the Government. As Justice Story wrote for the Court,</p>\n<blockquote>\"The common law of England is not to be taken in all respects to be that of America. Our ancestors brought with them its general principles, and claimed it as their birthright; but they brought with them and adopted only that portion which was applicable to their situation.\" <i>Van Ness v. Pacard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85621\"><a href=\"/opinion/85621/van-ness-v-pacard/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 144, 7 L.Ed. 374 (1829).</blockquote>\n<p>See also Hall, The Common Law: An Account of its Reception in the United States, 4 Vand. L.Rev. 791 (1951). It accords with that principle to say, as the plurality opinion said in <i>Reid:</i> \"When the Government reaches out to punish a citizen who is abroad, the shield which the Bill of Rights and other parts of the Constitution provide to protect his life and liberty should not be stripped away just because he happens to be in another land.\" 354 U.S., at 6, 77 S.Ct. 1222; see also <i>Verdugo-Urquidez,</i> 494 U.S., at 269-270, 110 S.Ct. 1056. On that analysis, \"[t]he distinction between citizens and aliens follows from the undoubted proposition that the Constitution does not create, nor do general principles of law create, any juridical relation between our country and some undefined, limitless class of noncitizens who are beyond our territory.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 275, 110 S.Ct. 1056 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>In sum, because I conclude that the text and history of the Suspension Clause provide no basis for our jurisdiction, I would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2307</span> affirm the Court of Appeals even if <i>Eisentrager</i> did not govern these cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Today the Court warps our Constitution in a way that goes beyond the narrow issue of the reach of the Suspension Clause, invoking judicially brainstormed separation-of-powers principles to establish a manipulable \"functional\" test for the extraterritorial reach of habeas corpus (and, no doubt, for the extraterritorial reach of other constitutional protections as well). It blatantly misdescribes important precedents, most conspicuously Justice Jackson's opinion for the Court in <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager</i><i>.</i> It breaks a chain of precedent as old as the common law that prohibits judicial inquiry into detentions of aliens abroad absent statutory authorization. And, most tragically, it sets our military commanders the impossible task of proving to a civilian court, under whatever standards this Court devises in the future, that evidence supports the confinement of each and every enemy prisoner.</p>\n<p>The Nation will live to regret what the Court has done today. I dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In light of the foregoing, the concurrence is wrong to suggest that I \"insufficiently appreciat[e]\" the issue of delay in these cases. See <i>ante,</i> at 2278 (opinion of SOUTER, J.). This Court issued its decisions in <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137000\"><a href=\"/opinion/137000/rasul-v-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548, and <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137001\"><a href=\"/opinion/137001/hamdi-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578, in 2004. The concurrence makes it sound as if the political branches have done nothing in the interim. In fact, Congress responded 18 months later by enacting the DTA. Congress cannot be faulted for taking that time to consider how best to accommodate both the detainees' interests and the need to keep the American people safe. Since the DTA became law, petitioners have steadfastly refused to avail themselves of the statute's review mechanisms. It is unfair to complain that the DTA system involves too much delay when petitioners have consistently refused to use it, preferring to litigate instead. Today's decision obligating district courts to craft new procedures to replace those in the DTA will only prolong the process\u0097and delay relief.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court wonders what might happen if the detainee puts forward new material evidence but the Deputy Secretary refuses to convene a new CSRT. See <i>ante,</i> at 2273-2274. The answer is that the detainee can petition the D.C. Circuit for review. The DTA directs that the procedures for review of new evidence be included among \"[t]he procedures submitted under paragraph (1)(A)\" governing CSRT review of enemy combatant status \u00a7 1405(a)(3), 119 Stat. 3476. It is undisputed that the D.C. Circuit has statutory authority to review and enforce these procedures. See DTA \u00a7 1005(e)(2)(C)(i), <i>id.,</i> at 2742.</p>\n<p>[1]  Even today, the Court cannot resist striking a pose of faux deference to Congress and the President. Citing the above quoted passage, the Court says: \"The political branches, consistent with their independent obligations to interpret and uphold the Constitution, can engage in a genuine debate about how best to preserve constitutional values while protecting the Nation from terrorism.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2277. Indeed. What the Court apparently means is that the political branches can debate, after which the Third Branch will decide.</p>\n<p>[2]  The opinion seeks to avoid this straightforward conclusion by saying that the Court has been \"careful not to foreclose the possibility that the protections of the Suspension Clause have expanded along with post-1789 developments that define the present scope of the writ.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2247-2248 (citing <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span> 300-301, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001)). But not foreclosing the possibility that they have expanded is not the same as demonstrating (or at least holding without demonstration, which seems to suffice for today's majority) that they have expanded. The Court must either hold that the Suspension Clause has \"expanded\" in its application to aliens abroad, or acknowledge that it has no basis to set aside the actions of Congress and the President. It does neither.</p>\n<p>[3]  In its failed attempt to distinguish <i>Eisentrager,</i> the Court comes up with the notion that \"<i>de jure</i> sovereignty\" is simply an additional factor that can be added to (presumably) \"<i>de facto</i> sovereignty\" (<i>i.e.,</i> practical control) to determine the availability of habeas for aliens, but that it is not a necessary factor, whereas <i>de facto</i> sovereignty is. It is perhaps in this <i>de facto</i> sense, the Court speculates, that <i>Eisentrager</i> found \"sovereignty\" lacking. See <i>ante,</i> at 2252-2253. If that were so, one would have expected <i>Eisentrager</i> to explain in some detail why the United States did not have practical control over the American zone of occupation. It did not (and probably could not). Of course this novel <i>de facto-de jure</i> approach does not explain why the writ never issued to Scotland, which was assuredly within the <i>de facto</i> control of the English crown. See <i>infra,</i> at 2305.\n</p>\n<p>To support its holding that <i>de facto</i> sovereignty is relevant to the reach of habeas corpus, the Court cites our decision in <i>Fleming v. Page,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86587\"><a href=\"/opinion/86587/fleming-v-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 13 L.Ed. 276 (1850), a case about the application of a customs statute to a foreign port occupied by U.S. forces. See <i>ante,</i> at 2252. The case used the phrase \"subject to the sovereignty and dominion of the United States\" to refer to the United States' practical control over a \"foreign country.\" 9 How., at 614. But <i>Fleming</i> went on to explain that because the port remained part of the \"enemy's country,\" even though under U.S. military occupation, \"its subjugation did not compel the United States, while they held it, to regard it as part of their dominions, nor to give to it any form of civil government, nor to extend to it our laws.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 618. If <i>Fleming</i> is relevant to these cases at all, it undermines the Court's holding.</p>\n<p>[4]  Justice SOUTER's concurrence relies on our decision four Terms ago in <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137000\"><a href=\"/opinion/137000/rasul-v-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004), where the Court interpreted the habeas statute to extend to aliens held at Guantanamo Bay. He thinks that \"no one who reads the Court's opinion in <i>Rasul</i> could seriously doubt that the jurisdictional question must be answered the same way in purely constitutional cases.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2240-2241. But <i>Rasul</i> was devoted primarily to an explanation of why <i>Eisentrager</i>'s statutory holding no longer controlled given our subsequent decision in <i>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108730\"><a href=\"/opinion/108730/braden-v-30th-judicial-circuit-court-of-ky/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span>, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973). See <i>Rasul, supra,</i> at 475-479, 124 S.Ct. 2686. And the opinion of the Court today \u0097 which Justice SOUTER joins \u0097 expressly rejects the historical evidence cited in <i>Rasul</i> to support its conclusion about the reach of habeas corpus. Compare <i>id.,</i> at 481-482, 124 S.Ct. 2686, with <i>ante,</i> at 2249. Moreover, even if one were to accept as true what Justice SOUTER calls <i>Rasul</i>'s \"well-considered\" dictum, that does not explain why <i>Eisentrager</i>'s constitutional holding must be overruled or how it can be distinguished. (After all, <i>Rasul</i> distinguished <i>Eisentrager</i>'s statutory holding on a ground inapplicable to its constitutional holding.) In other words, even if the Court were to conclude that <i>Eisentrager</i>'s rule was incorrect as an original matter, the Court would have to explain the justification for departing from that precedent. It therefore cannot possibly be true that <i>Rasul</i> controls this case, as Justice SOUTER suggests.</p>\n<p>[5]  My dissent in <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137000\"><a href=\"/opinion/137000/rasul-v-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 503, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004), mistakenly included Scotland among the places to which the writ could run.</p>\n<p>[6]  The dicta in <i>Rasul</i> also cited <i>Ex parte Mwenya,</i> [1960] 1 Q.B. 241, (C. A.), but as I explained in dissent, \"[e]ach judge [in <i>Mwenya</i>] made clear that the detainee's status as a subject was material to the resolution of the case,\" 542 U.S., at 504, 124 S.Ct. 2686.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Court also argues that the fact that the writ could run to Ireland, even though it was ruled under a \"separate\" crown, shows that formal sovereignty was not the touchstone of habeas jurisdiction. <i>Ante,</i> at 2250-2251. The passage from Blackstone that the Court cites, however, describes Ireland as \"a dependent, subordinate kingdom\" that was part of the \"king's dominions.\" 1 Blackstone 98, 100 (internal quotation marks omitted). And Lord Mansfield's opinion in <i>Cowle</i> plainly understood Ireland to be \"a dominion of the Crown of England,\" in contrast to the \"foreign dominio[n]\" of Scotland, and thought that distinction dispositive of the question of habeas jurisdiction. <i>Cowle, supra,</i> at 856, 97 Eng. Rep., at 599-600.</p>\n\n</div>",
