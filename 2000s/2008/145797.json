Letter, Jonathan H. Levy, Lewis S. Yelin, Washington, D.C., for Federal Parties.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Multinational Force-Iraq (MNF-I) is an international coalition force operating in Iraq composed of 26 different nations, including the United States. The force operates under the unified command of United States military officers, at the request of the Iraqi Government, and in accordance with United Nations (U.N.) Security Council Resolutions. Pursuant to the U.N. mandate, MNF-I forces detain individuals alleged to have committed hostile or warlike acts in Iraq, pending investigation and prosecution in Iraqi courts under Iraqi law.</p>\n<p>These consolidated cases concern the availability of habeas corpus relief arising from the MNF-I's detention of American citizens who voluntarily traveled to Iraq and are alleged to have committed crimes there. We are confronted with two questions. <i>First,</i> do United States courts have jurisdiction over habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of American citizens challenging their detention in Iraq by the MNF-I? <i>Second,</i> if such jurisdiction exists, may district courts exercise that jurisdiction to enjoin the MNF-I from transferring such individuals to Iraqi custody or allowing them to be tried before Iraqi courts?</p>\n<p>We conclude that the habeas statute extends to American citizens held overseas by American forces operating subject to an American chain of command, even when those forces are acting as part of a multinational coalition. Under circumstances such as those presented here, however, habeas corpus provides petitioners with no relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Pursuant to its U.N. mandate, the MNF-I has \"`the authority to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq.'\" App. G to Pet. for Cert. in 07-394, p. 74a, ¶ 10 (quoting U.N. Security Council, U.N. Doc. S/Res/1546, ¶ 10 (June 2004)). To this end, the MNF-I engages in a variety of military and humanitarian activities. The multinational force, for example, conducts combat operations against insurgent factions, trains and equips Iraqi security forces, and aids in relief and reconstruction efforts.</p>\n<p>MNF-I forces also detain individuals who pose a threat to the security of Iraq. The Government of Iraq retains ultimate responsibility for the arrest and imprisonment of individuals who violate its laws, but because many of Iraq's prison facilities have been destroyed, the MNF-I agreed to maintain physical custody of many such individuals during Iraqi criminal proceedings. MNF-I forces are currently holding approximately 24,000 detainees. An American military unit, Task Force 134, oversees detention operations and facilities in Iraq, including those located at Camp Cropper, the detention facility currently housing Shawqi Omar and Mohammad Munaf (hereinafter petitioners). The unit is under the command of United States <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2214</span> military officers who report to General David Petraeus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Shawqi Omar, an American-Jordanian citizen, voluntarily traveled to Iraq in 2002. In October 2004, Omar was captured and detained in Iraq by U.S. military forces operating as part of the MNF-I during a raid of his Baghdad home. Omar is believed to have provided aid to Abu Musab al-Zarqawithe late leader of al Qaeda in Iraqby facilitating his group's connection with other terrorist groups, bringing foreign fighters into Iraq, and planning and executing kidnappings in Iraq. MNF-I searched his home in an effort to capture and detain insurgents who were associated with al-Zarqawi. The raid netted an Iraqi insurgent and four Jordanian fighters along with explosive devices and other weapons.</p>\n<p>The captured insurgents gave sworn statements implicating Omar in insurgent cell activities. The four Jordanians testified that they had traveled to Iraq with Omar to commit militant acts against American and other Coalition Forces. Each of the insurgents stated that, while living in Omar's home, they had surveilled potential kidnap victims and conducted weapons training. The insurgents explained that Omar's fluency in English allowed him to lure foreigners to his home in order to kidnap and sell them for ransom.</p>\n<p>Following Omar's arrest, a three-member MNF-I Tribunal composed of American military officers concluded that Omar posed a threat to the security of Iraq and designated him a \"security internee.\" The tribunal also found that Omar had committed hostile and warlike acts, and that he was an enemy combatant in the war on terrorism. In accordance with Article 5 of the Geneva Convention, Omar was permitted to hear the basis for his detention, make a statement, and call immediately available witnesses.</p>\n<p>In addition to the review of his detention by the MNF-I Tribunal, Omar received a hearing before the Combined Review and Release Board (CRRB)a nine-member board composed of six representatives of the Iraqi Government and three MNF-I officers. The CRRB, like the MNF-I Tribunal, concluded that Omar's continued detention was necessary because he posed a threat to Iraqi security. At all times since his capture, Omar has remained in the custody of the United States military operating as part of the MNF-I.</p>\n<p>Omar's wife and son filed a next-friend petition for a writ of habeas corpus on Omar's behalf in the District Court for the District of Columbia. <i>Omar v. Harvey,</i> 479 F.3d 1, 4 (C.A.D.C.2007). After the Department of Justice informed Omar that the MNF-I had decided to refer him to the Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI) for criminal proceedings, his attorney sought and obtained a preliminary injunction barring Omar's \"remov[al] ... from United States or MNF-I custody.\" App. to Pet. in No. 07-394, <i>supra,</i> at 59a. The order directed that</p>\n<blockquote>\"the [United States], their agents, servants, employees, confederates, and any persons acting in concert or participation with them, or having actual or implicit knowledge of this Order ... shall not remove [Omar] from United States or MNF-I custody, or take any other action inconsistent with this court's memorandum opinion.\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The United States appealed and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. <i>Omar,</i> 479 F.3d 1. The Court of Appeals first upheld the District Court's exercise of habeas jurisdiction, finding that this Court's decision in <i>Hirota v. MacArthur,</i> 338 U.S. 197, 69 S.Ct. 197, 93 L.Ed. 1902 (1948) (<i>per curiam</i>), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2215</span> did not preclude review. The Court of Appeals distinguished <i>Hirota</i> on the ground that Omar, unlike the petitioner in that case, had yet to be convicted by a foreign tribunal. 479 F.3d, at 7-9. The Court of Appeals recognized, however, that the writ of habeas corpus could not be used to enjoin release. <i>Id.,</i> at 11. It therefore construed the injunction only to bar transfer to Iraqi custody and upheld the District Court's order insofar as it prohibited the United States from: (1) transferring Omar to Iraqi custody, <i>id.,</i> at 11-13; (2) sharing details concerning any decision to release Omar with the Iraqi Government, <i>id.,</i> at 13; and (3) presenting Omar to the Iraqi Courts for investigation and prosecution, <i>id.,</i> at 14.</p>\n<p>Judge Brown dissented. She joined the panel's jurisdictional ruling, but would have vacated the injunction because, in her view, the District Court had no authority to enjoin a transfer that would allow Iraqi officials to take custody of an individual captured in Iraqsomething the Iraqi Government \"undeniably h[ad] a right to do.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 19. We granted certiorari. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 741, 169 L.Ed.2d 578 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Munaf, a citizen of both Iraq and the United States, voluntarily traveled to Iraq with several Romanian journalists. He was to serve as the journalists' translator and guide. Shortly after arriving in Iraq, the group was kidnapped and held captive for two months. After the journalists were freed, MNF-I forces detained Munaf based on their belief that he had orchestrated the kidnappings.</p>\n<p>A three-judge MNF-I Tribunal conducted a hearing to determine whether Munaf's detention was warranted. The MNF-I Tribunal reviewed the facts surrounding Munaf's capture, interviewed witnesses, and considered the available intelligence information. Munaf was present at the hearing and had an opportunity to hear the grounds for his detention, make a statement, and call immediately available witnesses. At the end of the hearing, the tribunal found that Munaf posed a serious threat to Iraqi security, designated him a \"security internee,\" and referred his case to the CCCI for criminal investigation and prosecution.</p>\n<p>During his CCCI trial, Munaf admitted on camera and in writing that he had facilitated the kidnapping of the Romanian journalists. He also appeared as a witness against his alleged co-conspirators. Later in the proceedings, Munaf recanted his confession, but the CCCI nonetheless found him guilty of kidnapping. On appeal, the Iraqi Court of Cassation vacated Munaf's conviction and remanded his case to the CCCI for further investigation. <i>In re Hikmat,</i> No. 19/Pub. Comm'n/2007, p. 5 (Feb. 19, 2008). The Court of Cassation directed that Munaf was to \"remain in custody pending the outcome\" of further criminal proceedings. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Munaf's sister filed a next-friend petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the District of Columbia. <i>Mohammed v. Harvey,</i> 456 F.Supp.2d 115, 118 (2006). The District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, finding that this Court's decision in <i>Hirota</i> controlled: Munaf was \"in the custody of coalition troops operating under the aegis of MNF-I, who derive their ultimate authority from the United Nations and the MNF-I member nations acting jointly.\" 456 F.Supp.2d, at 122.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. 482 F.3d 582 (2007) (hereinafter <i>Munaf</i>). The Court of Appeals, \"[c]onstrained by precedent,\" agreed with the District Court that <i>Hirota</i> controlled and dismissed Munaf's petition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2216</span> for lack of jurisdiction. 482 F.3d, at 583. It distinguished the prior opinion in <i>Omar</i> on the ground that Munaf, like the habeas petitioner in <i>Hirota</i> but unlike Omar, had been convicted by a foreign tribunal. 482 F.3d, at 583-584.</p>\n<p>Judge Randolph concurred in the judgment. <i>Id.,</i> at 585. He concluded that the District Court had improperly dismissed for want of jurisdiction because \"Munaf is an American citizen ... held by American forces overseas.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Nevertheless, Judge Randolph would have held that Munaf's habeas petition failed on the merits. <i>Id.,</i> at 586. He relied on this Court's holding in <i>Wilson v. Girard,</i> 354 U.S. 524, 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409, 1 L.Ed.2d 1544 (1957), that a \"sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\" and concluded that the fact that the United States was holding Munaf because of his conviction by a foreign tribunal was conclusive. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari and consolidated the <i>Omar</i> and <i>Munaf</i> cases. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 741, 169 L.Ed.2d 578 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Solicitor General argues that the federal courts lack jurisdiction over the detainees' habeas petitions because the American forces holding Omar and Munaf operate as part of a multinational force. Brief for Federal Parties 17-36. The habeas statute provides that a federal district court may entertain a habeas application by a person held \"in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States,\" or \"in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241(c)(1), (3). MNF-I forces, the argument goes, \"are not operating solely under United States authority, but rather `as the agent of' a multinational force.\" Brief for Federal Parties 23 (quoting <i>Hirota, supra,</i> at 198, 69 S.Ct. 197). Omar and Munaf are thus held pursuant to international authority, not \"the authority of the United States,\" § 2241(c)(1), and they are therefore not within the reach of the habeas statute. Brief for Federal Parties 17-18.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The United States acknowledges that Omar and Munaf are American citizens held overseas in the immediate \"`physical custody'\" of American soldiers who answer only to an American chain of command. <i>Id.,</i> at 21. The MNF-I itself operates subject to a unified American command. <i>Id.,</i> at 23. \"[A]s a practical matter,\" the Government concedes, it is \"the President and the Pentagon, the Secretary of Defense, and the American commanders that control what ... American soldiers do,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 15, including the soldiers holding Munaf and Omar. In light of these admissions, it is unsurprising that the United States has never argued that it lacks the authority to release Munaf or Omar, or that it requires the consent of other countries to do so.</p>\n<p>We think these concessions the end of the jurisdictional inquiry. The Government's argumentthat the federal courts have no jurisdiction over American citizens held by American forces operating as multinational agentsis not easily reconciled with the text of § 2241(c)(1). See <i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> 533 U.S. 167, 172, 121 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2217</span> S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001) (\"We begin, as always, with the language of the statute\"). That section applies to persons held \"in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States.\" § 2241(c)(1). An individual is held \"in custody\" by the United States when the United States official charged with his detention has \"the power to produce\" him. <i>Wales v. Whitney,</i> 114 U.S. 564, 574, 5 S.Ct. 1050, 29 L.Ed. 277 (1885); see also § 2243 (\"The writ ... shall be directed to the person having custody of the person detained\"). The disjunctive \"or\" in § 2241(c)(1) makes clear that actual custody by the United States suffices for jurisdiction, even if that custody could be viewed as \"under ... color of\" another authority, such as the MNF-I.</p>\n<p>The Government's primary contention is that the District Courts lack jurisdiction in these cases because of this Court's decision in <i>Hirota.</i> That slip of a case cannot bear the weight the Government would place on it. In <i>Hirota,</i> Japanese citizens sought permission to file habeas corpus applications directly in this Court. The petitioners were noncitizens detained in Japan. They had been convicted and sentenced by the International Military Tribunal for the Far Eastan international tribunal established by General Douglas MacArthur acting, as the Court put it, in his capacity as \"the agent of the Allied Powers.\" 338 U.S., at 198, 69 S.Ct. 197. Although those familiar with the history of the period would appreciate the possibility of confusion over who General MacArthur took orders from, the Court concluded that the sentencing tribunal was \"not a tribunal of the United States.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Court then held that, \"[u]nder the foregoing circumstances,\" United States courts had \"no power or authority to review, to affirm, set aside or annul the judgments and sentences\" imposed by that tribunal. <i>Ibid.</i> Accordingly, the Court denied petitioners leave to file their habeas corpus applications, without further legal analysis. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Government argues that the multinational character of the MNF-I, like the multinational character of the tribunal at issue in <i>Hirota,</i> means that it too is not a United States entity subject to habeas. Reply Brief for Federal Parties 5-7. In making this claim, the Government acknowledges that the MNF-I is subject to American authority, but contends that the same was true of the tribunal at issue in <i>Hirota.</i> In <i>Hirota,</i> the Government notes, the petitioners were held by the United States Eighth Army, which took orders from General MacArthur, 338 U.S., at 199, 69 S.Ct. 197 (Douglas, J., concurring), and were subject to an \"unbroken\" chain of U.S. command, ending with the President of the United States, <i>id.,</i> at 207, 69 S.Ct. 197.</p>\n<p>The Court in <i>Hirota,</i> however, may have found it significant, in considering the nature of the tribunal established by General MacArthur, that the Solicitor General expressly contended that General MacArthur, as pertinent, was not subject to United States authority. The facts suggesting that the tribunal in <i>Hirota</i> was subject to an \"unbroken\" United States chain of command were not among the \"foregoing circumstances\" cited in the <i>per curiam</i> opinion disposing of the case, <i>id.,</i> at 198, 69 S.Ct. 197. They were highlighted only in Justice Douglas's belated opinion concurring in the result, published five months after that <i>per curiam. Id.,</i> at 199, n. *, 69 S.Ct. 197. Indeed, arguing before this Court, Solicitor General Perlman stated that General MacArthur did not serve \"under the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\" that his duty was \"to obey the directives of the Far Eastern Commission and not our War Department,\" and that \"no process that could be issued from this court ... would have any effect on his action.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2218</span> in <i>Hirota v. MacArthur</i><i>,</i> O.T.1948, No. 239, pp. 42, 50, 51. Here, in contrast, the Government acknowledges that our military commanders do answer to the President.</p>\n<p>Even if the Government is correct that the international authority at issue in <i>Hirota</i> is no different from the international authority at issue here, the present \"circumstances\" differ in another respect. These cases concern American citizens while <i>Hirota</i> did not, and the Court has indicated that habeas jurisdiction can depend on citizenship. See <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager,</i> 339 U.S. 763, 781, 70 S.Ct. 936, 94 L.Ed. 1255 (1950); <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> 542 U.S. 466, 486, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). See also <i>Munaf,</i> 482 F.3d, at 584 (\"[W]e do not mean to suggest that we find the logic of <i>Hirota</i> especially clear or compelling, particularly as applied to American citizens\"); <i>id.,</i> at 585 (Randolph, J., concurring in judgment).<sup>[3]</sup> \"Under the foregoing circumstances,\" we decline to extend our holding in <i>Hirota</i> to preclude American citizens held overseas by American soldiers subject to a United States chain of command from filing habeas petitions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We now turn to the question whether United States district courts may exercise their habeas jurisdiction to enjoin our Armed Forces from transferring individuals detained within another sovereign's territory to that sovereign's government for criminal prosecution. The nature of that question requires us to proceed \"with the circumspection appropriate when this Court is adjudicating issues inevitably entangled in the conduct of our international relations.\" <i>Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co.,</i> 358 U.S. 354, 383, 79 S.Ct. 468, 3 L.Ed.2d 368 (1959). Here there is the further consideration that those issues arise in the context of ongoing military operations conducted by American Forces overseas. We therefore approach these questions cognizant that \"courts traditionally have been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military and national security affairs.\" <i>Department of Navy v. Egan,</i> 484 U.S. 518, 530, 108 S.Ct. 818, 98 L.Ed.2d 918 (1988).</p>\n<p>In <i>Omar,</i> the District Court granted and the D.C. Circuit upheld a preliminary injunction that, as interpreted by the Court of Appeals, prohibited the United States from (1) effectuating \"Omar's transfer <i>in any form,</i> whether by an official handoff or otherwise,\" to Iraqi custody, 479 F.3d, at 12; (2) sharing details concerning any decision to release Omar with the Iraqi Government, <i>id.,</i> at 13; and (3) \"presenting Omar to the [Iraqi courts] for trial,\" <i>id.,</i> at 14. This is not a narrow injunction. Even the habeas petitioners do not defend it in its entirety. They acknowledge the authority of the Iraqi courts to begin criminal proceedings against Omar and wisely concede that any injunction \"clearly need not include a bar on `information-sharing.'\" Brief for Habeas Petitioners 61. As Judge Brown noted in her dissent, such a bar would impermissibly \"enjoin the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2219</span> United States military from sharing information with an allied foreign sovereign in a war zone.\" <i>Omar, supra,</i> at 18.</p>\n<p>We begin with the basics. A preliminary injunction is an \"extraordinary and drastic remedy,\" 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948, p. 129 (2d ed.1995) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller) (footnotes omitted); it is never awarded as of right, <i>Yakus v. United States,</i> 321 U.S. 414, 440, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834 (1944). Rather, a party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate, among other things, \"a likelihood of success on the merits.\" <i>Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal,</i> 546 U.S. 418, 428, 126 S.Ct. 1211, 163 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2006) (citing <i>Mazurek v. Armstrong,</i> 520 U.S. 968, 972, 117 S.Ct. 1865, 138 L.Ed.2d 162 (1997) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc.,</i> 422 U.S. 922, 931, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975)). But one searches the opinions below in vain for any mention of a likelihood of success as to the merits of Omar's habeas petition. Instead, the District Court concluded that the \"<i>jurisdictional</i> issues\" presented questions \"so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberative investigation.\" <i>Omar v. Harvey,</i> 416 F.Supp.2d 19, 23-24, 27 (DC 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The D.C. Circuit made the same mistake. In that court's view, the \"only question before [it] at th[at] stage of the litigation relate[d] to the district court's jurisdiction.\" 479 F.3d, at 11. As a result, the Court of Appeals held that it \"need not address\" the merits of Omar's habeas claims: those merits had \"no relevance.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>A difficult question as to jurisdiction is, of course, no reason to grant a preliminary injunction. It says nothing about the \"likelihood of success on the merits,\" other than making such success more <i>unlikely</i> due to potential impediments to even reaching the merits. Indeed, if all a \"likelihood of success on the merits\" meant was that the district court likely had jurisdiction, then preliminary injunctions would be the rule, not the exception. In light of these basic principles, we hold that it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to grant a preliminary injunction on the view that the \"jurisdictional issues\" in Omar's case were tough, without even considering the merits of the underlying habeas petition.</p>\n<p>What we have said thus far would require reversal and remand in each of these cases: The lower courts in <i>Munaf</i> erred in dismissing for want of jurisdiction, and the lower courts in <i>Omar</i> erred in issuing and upholding the preliminary injunction. There are occasions, however, when it is appropriate to proceed further and address the merits. This is one of them.</p>\n<p>Our authority to address the merits of the habeas petitioners' claims is clear. Review of a preliminary injunction \"is not confined to the act of granting the injunctio[n], but extends as well to determining whether there is any insuperable objection, in point of jurisdiction or merits, to the maintenance of [the] bill, and, if so, to directing a final decree dismissing it.\" <i>City and County of Denver v. New York Trust Co.,</i> 229 U.S. 123, 136, 33 S.Ct. 657, 57 L.Ed. 1101 (1913). See also <i>Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp.,</i> 311 U.S. 282, 287, 61 S.Ct. 229, 85 L.Ed. 189 (1940) (\"`If insuperable objection to maintaining the bill clearly appears, it may be dismissed and the litigation terminated'\" (quoting <i>Meccano, Ltd. v. John Wanamaker, N. Y.,</i> 253 U.S. 136, 141, 40 S.Ct. 463, 64 L.Ed. 822 (1920))). This has long been the rule: \"By the ordinary practice in equity as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2220</span> administered in England and this country,\" a reviewing court has the power on appeal from an interlocutory order \"to examine the merits of the case ... and upon deciding them in favor of the defendant to dismiss the bill.\" <i>North Carolina R. Co. v. Story,</i> 268 U.S. 288, 292, 45 S.Ct. 531, 69 L.Ed. 959 (1925). Indeed, \"[t]he question whether an action should be dismissed for failure to state a claim is one of the most common issues that may be reviewed on appeal from an interlocutory injunction order.\" 16 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Jurisdiction and Related Matters, § 3921.1, at 32 (2d ed.1996).</p>\n<p>Adjudication of the merits is most appropriate if the injunction rests on a question of law and it is plain that the plaintiff cannot prevail. In such cases, the defendant is entitled to judgment. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Deckert, supra,</i> at 287, 61 S.Ct. 229; <i>North Carolina R. Co., supra,</i> at 292, 45 S.Ct. 531; <i>City and County of Denver, supra,</i> at 136, 33 S.Ct. 657.</p>\n<p>Given that the present cases involve habeas petitions that implicate sensitive foreign policy issues in the context of ongoing military operations, reaching the merits is the wisest course. See <i>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer,</i> 343 U.S. 579, 584-585, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952) (finding the case ripe for merits review on appeal from stay of preliminary injunction). For the reasons we explain below, the relief sought by the habeas petitioners makes clear under our precedents that the power of the writ ought not to be exercised. Because the Government is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, it is appropriate for us to terminate the litigation now.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The habeas petitioners argue that the writ should be granted in their cases because they have \"a legally enforceable right\" not to be transferred to Iraqi authority for criminal proceedings under both the Due Process Clause and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARR Act), div. G, 112 Stat. 2681-761, and because they are innocent civilians who have been unlawfully detained by the United States in violation of the Due Process Clause. Brief for Habeas Petitioners 48-52. With respect to the transfer claim, petitioners request an injunction prohibiting the United States from transferring them to Iraqi custody. With respect to the unlawful detention claim, petitioners seek \"release\"but only to the extent that release would not result in \"unlawful\" transfer to Iraqi custody. Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Both of these requests would interfere with Iraq's sovereign right to \"punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders.\" <i>Wilson,</i> 354 U.S., at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409. We accordingly hold that the detainees' claims do not state grounds upon which habeas relief may be granted, that the habeas petitions should have been promptly dismissed, and that no injunction should have been entered.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Habeas corpus is \"governed by equitable principles.\" <i>Fay v. Noia,</i> 372 U.S. 391, 438, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963). We have therefore recognized that \"prudential concerns,\" <i>Withrow v. Williams,</i> 507 U.S. 680, 686, 113 S.Ct. 1745, 123 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993), such as comity and the orderly administration of criminal justice, may \"require a federal court to forgo the exercise of its habeas corpus power,\" <i>Francis v. Henderson,</i> 425 U.S. 536, 539, 96 S.Ct. 1708, 48 L.Ed.2d 149 (1976).</p>\n<p>The principle that a habeas court is \"not bound in every case\" to issue the writ, <i>Ex parte Royall,</i> 117 U.S. 241, 251, 6 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2221</span> 734, 29 L.Ed. 868 (1886), follows from the precatory language of the habeas statute, and from its common-law origins. The habeas statute provides only that a writ of habeas corpus \"<i>may</i> be granted,\" § 2241(a) (emphasis added), and directs federal courts to \"dispose of [habeas petitions] as law and justice require,\" § 2243. See <i>Danforth v. Minnesota,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 169 L.Ed.2d 859 (2008). Likewise, the writ did not issue in England \"as of mere course,\" but rather required the petitioner to demonstrate why the \"extraordinary power of the crown\" should be exercised, 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 132 (1768); even then, courts were directed to \"do as to justice shall appertain,\" 1 <i>id.,</i> at 131 (1765). The question, therefore, even where a habeas court has the power to issue the writ, is \"whether this be a case in which [that power] ought to be exercised.\" <i>Ex parte Watkins,</i> 3 Pet. 193, 201, 7 L.Ed. 650 (1830) (Marshall, C. J.).</p>\n<p>At the outset, the nature of the relief sought by the habeas petitioners suggests that habeas is not appropriate in these cases. Habeas is at its core a remedy for unlawful executive detention. <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,</i> 542 U.S. 507, 536, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004) (plurality opinion). The typical remedy for such detention is, of course, release. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Preiser v. Rodriguez,</i> 411 U.S. 475, 484, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (\"[T]he traditional function of the writ is to secure release from illegal custody\"). But here the last thing petitioners want is simple release; that would expose them to apprehension by Iraqi authorities for criminal prosecutionprecisely what petitioners went to federal court to avoid. At the end of the day, what petitioners are really after is a court order requiring the United States to shelter them from the sovereign government seeking to have them answer for alleged crimes committed within that sovereign's borders.</p>\n<p>The habeas petitioners do not dispute that they voluntarily traveled to Iraq, that they remain detained within the sovereign territory of Iraq today, or that they are alleged to have committed serious crimes in Iraq. Indeed, Omar and Munaf both concede that, if they were not in MNF-I custody, Iraq would be free to arrest and prosecute them under Iraqi law. See Tr. in <i>Omar,</i> No. 06-5126 (CADC), pp. 48-49, 59 (Sept. 11, 2006); Tr. in <i>Mohammed,</i> No. 06-1455(DC), pp. 15-16 (Oct. 10, 2006). There is, moreover, no question that Munaf is the subject of ongoing Iraqi criminal proceedings and that Omar would be but for the present injunction. Munaf was convicted by the CCCI, and while that conviction was overturned on appeal, his case was remanded to and is again pending before the CCCI. The MNF-I referred Omar to the CCCI for prosecution at which point he sought and obtained an injunction that prohibits his prosecution. See 479 F.3d, at 16, n. 3 (Brown, J., dissenting in part) (\"`[Omar] has not yet had a trial or even an investigative hearing in the CCCI due to the district court's unprecedented injunction'\" (citing Opposition to Petitioner's Emergency Motion for Injunctive Relief 18-19, in <i>Munaf v. Harvey,</i> No. 06-5324 (CADC, Oct. 25, 2006))).</p>\n<p>Given these facts, our cases make clear that Iraq has a sovereign right to prosecute Omar and Munaf for crimes committed on its soil. As Chief Justice Marshall explained nearly two centuries ago, \"[t]he jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute.\" <i>Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon,</i> 7 Cranch 116, 136, 3 L.Ed. 287 (1812). See <i>Wilson, supra,</i> at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409 (\"A sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2222</span> laws committed within its borders, unless it expressly or impliedly consents to surrender its jurisdiction\"); <i>Reid v. Covert,</i> 354 U.S. 1, 15, n. 29, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957) (opinion of Black, J.) (\"[A] foreign nation has plenary criminal jurisdiction ... over all Americans ... who commit offenses against its laws within its territory\"); <i>Kinsella v. Krueger,</i> 351 U.S. 470, 479, 76 S.Ct. 886, 100 L.Ed. 1342 (1956) (nations have a \"sovereign right to try and punish [American citizens] for offenses committed within their borders,\" unless they \"have relinquished [their] jurisdiction\" to do so).</p>\n<p>This is true with respect to American citizens who travel abroad and commit crimes in another nation whether or not the pertinent criminal process comes with all the rights guaranteed by our Constitution. \"When an American citizen commits a crime in a foreign country he cannot complain if required to submit to such modes of trial and to such punishment as the laws of that country may prescribe for its own people.\" <i>Neely v. Henkel,</i> 180 U.S. 109, 123, 21 S.Ct. 302, 45 L.Ed. 448 (1901).</p>\n<p>The habeas petitioners nonetheless argue that the Due Process Clause includes a \"[f]reedom from unlawful transfer\" that is \"protected <i>wherever</i> the government seizes a citizen.\" Brief for Habeas Petitioners 48. We disagree. Not only have we long recognized the principle that a nation state reigns sovereign within its own territory, we have twice applied that principle to reject claims that the Constitution precludes the Executive from transferring a prisoner to a foreign country for prosecution in an allegedly unconstitutional trial.</p>\n<p>In <i>Wilson,</i> 354 U.S. 524, 77 S.Ct. 1409, 1 L.Ed.2d 1544, we reversed an injunction similar to the one at issue here. During a cavalry exercise at the Camp Weir range in Japan, Girard, a Specialist Third Class in the United States Army, caused the death of a Japanese woman. <i>Id.,</i> at 525-526, 77 S.Ct. 1409. After Japan indicted Girard, but while he was still in United States custody, Girard filed a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. <i>Ibid.</i> The District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the United States, enjoining the \"proposed delivery of [Girard] to the Japanese Government.\" <i>Girard v. Wilson,</i> 152 F.Supp. 21, 27 (DC 1957). In the District Court's view, to permit the transfer to Japanese authority would violate the rights guaranteed to Girard by the Constitution. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, and vacated the injunction. 354 U.S., at 529-530, 77 S.Ct. 1409. We noted that Japan had exclusive jurisdiction \"to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\" unless it had surrendered that jurisdiction. <i>Id.,</i> at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409. Consequently, even though Japan had ceded some of its jurisdiction to the United States pursuant to a bilateral Status of Forces Agreement, the United States could waive that jurisdictionas it had done in Girard's caseand the habeas court was without authority to enjoin Girard's transfer to the Japanese authorities. <i>Id.,</i> at 529-530, 77 S.Ct. 1409.</p>\n<p>Likewise, in <i>Neely v. Henkel, supra</i><i>,</i> this Court held that habeas corpus was not available to defeat the criminal jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign, even when application of that sovereign's law would allegedly violate the Constitution. Neelythe habeas petitioner and an American citizen was accused of violating Cuban law in Cuba. <i>Id.,</i> at 112-113, 21 S.Ct. 302. He was arrested and detained in the United States. <i>Id.,</i> at 113, 21 S.Ct. 302. The United States indicated its intent to extradite him, and Neely filed suit seeking to block his extradition on the grounds that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2223</span> Cuban law did not provide the panoply of rights guaranteed him by the Constitution of the United States. <i>Id.,</i> at 122, 21 S.Ct. 302. We summarily rejected this claim: \"The answer to this suggestion is that those [constitutional] provisions have no relation to crimes committed without the jurisdiction of the United States against the laws of a foreign country.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Neely alleged no claim for which a \"discharge on <i>habeas corpus</i>\" could issue. <i>Id.,</i> at 125, 21 S.Ct. 302. Accordingly, the United States was free to transfer him to Cuban custody for prosecution.</p>\n<p>In the present cases, the habeas petitioners concede that Iraq has the sovereign authority to prosecute them for alleged violations of its law, yet nonetheless request an injunction prohibiting the United States from transferring them to Iraqi custody. But as the foregoing cases make clear, habeas is not a means of compelling the United States to harbor fugitives from the criminal justice system of a sovereign with undoubted authority to prosecute them.</p>\n<p>Petitioners' \"release\" claim adds nothing to their \"transfer\" claim. That claim fails for the same reasons the transfer claim fails, given that the release petitioners seek is release in a form that would avoid transfer. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47-48; App. 40 (coupling Munaf's claim for release with a request for order requiring the United States to bring him to a U.S. court); App. 123 (same with respect to Omar). Such \"release\" would impermissibly interfere with Iraq's \"exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\" <i>Wilson, supra,</i> at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409; the \"release\" petitioners seek is nothing less than an order commanding our forces to smuggle them out of Iraq. Indeed, the Court of Appeals in Omar's case took the extraordinary step of upholding an injunction that prohibited the Executive from releasing Omarthe quintessential habeas remedyif the United States shared information about his release with its military ally, Iraq. 479 F.3d, at 13. Habeas does not require the United States to keep an unsuspecting nation in the dark when it releases an alleged criminal insurgent within its borders.</p>\n<p>Moreover, because Omar and Munaf are being held by United States Armed Forces at the behest of the Iraqi Government pending their prosecution in Iraqi courts, <i>Mohammed,</i> 456 F.Supp.2d, at 117, release of <i>any</i> kind would interfere with the sovereign authority of Iraq \"to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\" <i>Wilson, supra,</i> at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409. This point becomes clear given that the MNF-I, pursuant to its U.N. mandate, is authorized to \"take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq,\" App. G to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07-394, p. 74a, ¶ 10, and specifically to provide for the \"internment [of individuals in Iraq] where this is necessary for imperative reasons of security,\" <i>id.,</i> at 86a.</p>\n<p>While the Iraqi Government is ultimately \"responsible for [the] arrest, detention and imprisonment\" of individuals who violate its laws, S.C. Res. 1790, Annex I, ¶ 4, p. 6, U.N. Doc. S/RES/1790 (Dec. 18, 2007), the MNF-I maintains physical custody of individuals like Munaf and Omar while their cases are being heard by the CCCI, <i>Mohammed, supra,</i> at 117. Indeed, Munaf is currently held at Camp Cropper pursuant to the express order of the Iraqi Courts. See <i>In re Hikmat,</i> No. 19/Pub. Comm'n/2007, at 5 (directing that Munaf \"remain in custody pending the outcome\" of further Iraqi proceedings). As that court order makes clear, MNF-I detention is an integral part of the Iraqi system of criminal justice. MNF-I forces <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2224</span> augment the Iraqi Government's peacekeeping efforts by functioning, in essence, as its jailor. Any requirement that the MNF-I release a detainee would, in effect, impose a release order on the Iraqi Government.</p>\n<p>The habeas petitioners acknowledge that <i>some</i> interference with a foreign criminal system is too much. They concede that \"it is axiomatic that an American court does not provide collateral review of proceedings in a foreign tribunal.\" Brief for Habeas Petitioners 39 (citing <i>Republic of Austria v. Altmann,</i> 541 U.S. 677, 700, 124 S.Ct. 2240, 159 L.Ed.2d 1 (2004)). We agree, but see no reason why habeas corpus should permit a prisoner detained within a foreign sovereign's territory to prevent a trial from going forward in the first place. It did not matter that the habeas petitioners in <i>Wilson</i> and <i>Neely</i> had not been convicted. 354 U.S., at 525-526, 77 S.Ct. 1409, 180 U.S., at 112-113, 21 S.Ct. 302. Rather, \"the same principles of comity and respect for foreign sovereigns that preclude judicial scrutiny of foreign convictions necessarily render invalid attempts to shield citizens from foreign prosecution in order to preempt such nonreviewable adjudications.\" <i>Omar,</i> 479 F.3d, at 17 (Brown, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>To allow United States courts to intervene in an ongoing foreign criminal proceeding and pass judgment on its legitimacy seems at least as great an intrusion as the plainly barred collateral review of foreign convictions. See <i>Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino,</i> 376 U.S. 398, 417-418, 84 S.Ct. 923, 11 L.Ed.2d 804 (1964) (\"`To permit the validity of the acts of one sovereign State to be reexamined and perhaps condemned by the courts of another would very certainly \"imperil the amicable relations between governments and vex the peace of nations\"'\" (quoting <i>Oetjen v. Central Leather Co.,</i> 246 U.S. 297, 303-304, 38 S.Ct. 309, 62 L.Ed. 726 (1918); punctuation omitted)).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>There is of course even more at issue here: Neither <i>Neely</i> nor <i>Wilson</i> concerned individuals captured and detained within an ally's territory during ongoing hostilities involving our troops. <i>Neely</i> involved a charge of embezzlement; <i>Wilson</i> the peacetime actions of a serviceman. Yet in those cases we held that the Constitution allows the Executive to transfer American citizens to foreign authorities for criminal prosecution. It would be passing strange to hold that the Executive lacks that same authority where, as here, the detainees were captured by our Armed Forces for engaging in serious hostile acts against an ally in what the Government refers to as \"an active theater of combat.\" Brief for Federal Parties 16.</p>\n<p>Such a conclusion would implicate not only concerns about interfering with a sovereign's recognized prerogative to apply its criminal law to those alleged to have committed crimes within its borders, but also concerns about unwarranted judicial intrusion into the Executive's ability to conduct military operations abroad. Our constitutional framework \"requires that the judiciary be as scrupulous not to interfere with legitimate Army matters as the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2225</span> Army must be scrupulous not to intervene in judicial matters.\" <i>Orloff v. Willoughby,</i> 345 U.S. 83, 94, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953). Those who commit crimes within a sovereign's territory may be transferred to that sovereign's government for prosecution; there is hardly an exception to that rule when the crime at issue is not embezzlement but unlawful insurgency directed against an ally during ongoing hostilities involving our troops.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Petitioners contend that these general principles are trumped in their cases because their transfer to Iraqi custody is likely to result in torture. This allegation was raised in Munaf's petition for habeas, App. 39, ¶ 46, but not in Omar's. Such allegations are of course a matter of serious concern, but in the present context that concern is to be addressed by the political branches, not the judiciary. See M. Bassiouni, International Extradition: United States Law and Practice 921 (2007) (\"<i>Habeas corpus</i> has been held not to be a valid means of inquiry into the treatment the relator is anticipated to receive in the requesting state\").</p>\n<p>This conclusion is reflected in the cases already cited. Even with respect to claims that detainees would be denied constitutional rights if transferred, we have recognized that it is for the political branches, not the judiciary, to assess practices in foreign countries and to determine national policy in light of those assessments. Thus, the Court in <i>Neely</i> concluded that an American citizen who \"commits a crime in a foreign country\" \"cannot complain if required to submit to such modes of trial and to such punishment as the laws of that country may prescribe for its own people,\" but went on to explain that this was true \"unless a different mode be provided for by treaty stipulation between that country and the United States.\" 180 U.S., at 123, 21 S.Ct. 302. Diplomacy was the means of addressing the petitioner's concerns.</p>\n<p>By the same token, while the Court in <i>Wilson</i> stated the general principle that a \"sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\" it recognized that this rule could be altered by diplomatic agreement in light of particular concerns as it was in that caseand by a decision of the Executive to waive jurisdiction granted under that agreementas it was in that case. 354 U.S., at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409. See also <i>Kinsella,</i> 351 U.S., at 479, 76 S.Ct. 886 (alteration of jurisdictional rule through \"carefully drawn agreements\"). This recognition that it is the political branches that bear responsibility for creating exceptions to the general rule is nothing new; as Chief Justice Marshall explained in the <i>Schooner Exchange,</i> \"exemptions from territorial jurisdiction ... must be derived from the consent of the sovereign of the territory\" and are \"rather questions of policy than of law, that they are for diplomatic, rather than legal discussion.\" 7 Cranch, at 143, 146, 3 L.Ed. 287. The present concerns are of the same nature as the loss of constitutional rights alleged in <i>Wilson</i> and <i>Neely,</i> and are governed by the same principles.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2226</span> The Executive Branch may, of course, decline to surrender a detainee for many reasons, including humanitarian ones. Petitioners here allege only the possibility of mistreatment in a prison facility; this is not a more extreme case in which the Executive has determined that a detainee is likely to be tortured but decides to transfer him anyway. Indeed, the Solicitor General states that it is the policy of the United States <i>not</i> to transfer an individual in circumstances where torture is likely to result. Brief for Federal Parties 47; Reply Brief for Federal Parties 23. In these cases the United States explains that, although it remains concerned about torture among some sectors of the Iraqi Government, the State Department has determined that the Justice Ministrythe department that would have authority over Munaf and Omaras well as its prison and detention facilities have \"`generally met internationally accepted standards for basic prisoner needs.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Solicitor General explains that such determinations are based on \"the Executive's assessment of the foreign country's legal system and... the Executive['s] ... ability to obtain foreign assurances it considers reliable.\" Brief for Federal Parties 47.</p>\n<p>The Judiciary is not suited to second-guess such determinationsdeterminations that would require federal courts to pass judgment on foreign justice systems and undermine the Government's ability to speak with one voice in this area. See The Federalist No. 42, p. 279 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (\"If we are to be one nation in any respect, it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations\"). In contrast, the political branches are well situated to consider sensitive foreign policy issues, such as whether there is a serious prospect of torture at the hands of an ally, and what to do about it if there is. As Judge Brown noted, \"we need not assume the political branches are oblivious to these concerns. Indeed, the other branches possess significant diplomatic tools and leverage the judiciary lacks.\" 479 F.3d, at 20, n. 6 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>Petitioners briefly argue that their claims of potential torture may not be readily dismissed on the basis of these principles because the FARR Act prohibits transfer when torture may result. Brief for Habeas Petitioners 51-52. Neither petitioner asserted a FARR Act claim in his petition for habeas, and the Act was not raised in any of the certiorari filings before this Court. Even in their merits brief in this Court, the habeas petitioners hardly discuss the issue. <i>Id.,</i> at 17, 51-52, 57-58. The Government treats the issue in kind. Reply Brief for Federal Parties 24-26. Under such circumstances we will not consider the question.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2227</span> 2</h2>\n<p>Finally, the habeas petitioners raise the additional argument that the United States may not transfer a detainee to Iraqi custody, not because it would be unconstitutional to do so, but because the \"[G]overnment may not transfer a citizen without legal authority.\" Brief for Habeas Petitioners 54. The United States, they claim, bears the burden of \"identify[ing] a treaty or statute that permits it to transfer the[m] to Iraqi custody.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 49.</p>\n<p>The habeas petitioners rely prominently on <i>Valentine v. United States ex rel. Neidecker,</i> 299 U.S. 5, 57 S.Ct. 100, 81 L.Ed. 5 (1936), where we ruled that the Executive may not extradite a person held within the United States unless \"legal authority\" to do so \"is given by act of Congress or by the terms of a treaty,\" <i>id.,</i> at 9, 57 S.Ct. 100. But <i>Valentine</i> is readily distinguishable. It involved the extradition of an individual from the United States; this is not an extradition case, but one involving the transfer to a sovereign's authority of an individual captured and already detained in that sovereign's territory. In the extradition context, when a \"fugitive criminal\" is found within the United States, \"`there is no authority vested in any department of the government to seize [him] and surrender him to a foreign power,'\" in the absence of a pertinent constitutional or legislative provision. <i>Ibid.</i> But Omar and Munaf voluntarily traveled to Iraq and are being held there. They are therefore subject to the territorial jurisdiction of that sovereign, not of the United States. Moreover, as we have explained, the petitioners are being held by the United States, acting as part of MNF-I, at the request of and on behalf of the Iraqi Government. It would be more than odd if the Government had no authority to transfer them to the very sovereign on whose behalf, and within whose territory, they are being detained.</p>\n<p>The habeas petitioners further contend that this Court's decision in <i>Wilson</i> supports their argument that the Executive lacks the discretion to transfer a citizen absent a treaty or statute. Brief for Habeas Petitioners 54-55. Quite the opposite. <i>Wilson</i> forecloses it. The only \"authority\" at issue in <i>Wilson</i>a Status of Forces Agreementseemed to give the habeas petitioner in that case a right to be tried by an American military tribunal, not a Japanese court. 354 U.S., at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409. Nevertheless, in light of the background principle that Japan had a sovereign interest in prosecuting crimes committed within its borders, this Court found no \"constitutional or statutory\" impediment to the United States's waiver of its jurisdiction under the agreement. <i>Id.,</i> at 530, 77 S.Ct. 1409.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Munaf and Omar are alleged to have committed hostile and warlike acts within the sovereign territory of Iraq during ongoing hostilities there. Pending their criminal prosecution for those offenses, Munaf and Omar are being held in Iraq by American forces operating pursuant to a U.N. Mandate and at the request of the Iraqi Government. Petitioners concede that Iraq has a sovereign right to prosecute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2228</span> them for alleged violations of its law. Yet they went to federal court seeking an order that would allow them to defeat precisely that sovereign authority. Habeas corpus does not require the United States to shelter such fugitives from the criminal justice system of the sovereign with authority to prosecute them.</p>\n<p>For all the reasons given above, petitioners state no claim in their habeas petitions for which relief can be granted, and those petitions should have been promptly dismissed. The judgments below and the injunction entered against the United States are vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice GINSBURG and Justice BREYER join, concurring.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that \"[u]nder circumstances such as those presented here, ... habeas corpus provides petitioners with no relief.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2213. The Court's opinion makes clear that those circumstances include the following: (1) Omar and Munaf \"voluntarily traveled to Iraq.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2221. They are being held (2) in the \"territory\" of (3) an \"all[y]\" of the United States, <i>ante,</i> at 2224, (4) by our troops, see <i>ante,</i> at 2216-2217, (5) \"during ongoing hostilities\" that (6) \"involv[e] our troops,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2224. (7) The government of a foreign sovereign, Iraq, has decided to prosecute them \"for crimes committed on its soil.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2221. And (8) \"the State Department has determined that ... the department that would have authority over Munaf and Omar ... as well as its prison and detention facilities have generally met internationally accepted standards for basic prisoner needs.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2226 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because I consider these circumstances essential to the Court's holding, I join its opinion.</p>\n<p>The Court accordingly reserves judgment on an \"extreme case in which the Executive has determined that a detainee [in United States custody] is likely to be tortured but decides to transfer him anyway.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2225-2226. I would add that nothing in today's opinion should be read as foreclosing relief for a citizen of the United States who resists transfer, say, from the American military to a foreign government for prosecution in a case of that sort, and I would extend the caveat to a case in which the probability of torture is well documented, even if the Executive fails to acknowledge it. Although the Court rightly points out that any likelihood of extreme mistreatment at the receiving government's hands is a proper matter for the political branches to consider, see <i>ante,</i> at 2225-2226, if the political branches did favor transfer it would be in order to ask whether substantive due process bars the Government from consigning its own people to torture. And although the Court points out that habeas is aimed at securing release, not protective detention, see <i>ante,</i> at 2221, habeas would not be the only avenue open to an objecting prisoner; \"where federally protected rights [are threatened], it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief,\" <i>Bell v. Hood,</i> 327 U.S. 678, 684, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946).</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  As noted above, Munaf's conviction was subsequently vacated by an Iraqi appellate court, and he is awaiting a new trial.</p>\n<p>[2]  These cases concern only American citizens and only the statutory reach of the writ. Nothing herein addresses jurisdiction with respect to alien petitioners or with respect to the constitutional scope of the writ.</p>\n<p>[3]  The circumstances in <i>Hirota</i> differ in yet another respect. The petitioners in that case sought an original writ, filing their motions for leave to file habeas petitions \"in this Court.\" 338 U.S., at 198, 69 S.Ct. 197. There is, however, some authority for the proposition that this Court has original subject-matter jurisdiction only over \"`cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party,'\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 174, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803) (quoting U.S. Const., Art. III, § 2, cl. 2), and Congress had not granted the Court appellate jurisdiction to review decisions of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.</p>\n<p>[4]  The habeas petitioners claim that the injunction only bars Omar's presentation to the Iraqi courts and that the CCCI trial can go forward in Omar's absence. The injunction is not so easily narrowed. It was entered on the theory that Omar might be \"presented to the CCCI and in that same day, be tried, [and] convicted,\" thus depriving the United States district courts of jurisdiction. <i>Omar v. Harvey,</i> 416 F.Supp.2d 19, 29 (DC 2006). Petitioners' interpretation makes no sense under that theory: If a conviction would deprive the habeas court of jurisdiction, a trial, with or without the defendant, could result in just such a jurisdiction-divesting order.</p>\n<p>[5]  The United States has in fact entered into treaties that provide procedural protections to American citizens tried in other nations. See, <i>e.g.,</i> North Atlantic Treaty: Status of Forces, June 19, 1951, 4 U.S.T. 1802, T.I.A.S. No. 2846, Art. VII, ¶ 9 (guaranteeing arrested members of the Armed Forces and their civilian dependents, <i>inter alia,</i> an attorney, an interpreter, and a prompt and speedy trial, as well as the right to confront witnesses, obtain favorable witnesses, and communicate with a representative of the United States).</p>\n<p>[6]  We hold that these habeas petitions raise no claim for relief under the FARR Act and express no opinion on whether Munaf and Omar may be permitted to amend their respective pleadings to raise such a claim on remand. Even if considered on the merits, several issues under the FARR Act claim would have to be addressed. First, the Act speaks to situations where a detainee is being \"returned\" to \"a country.\" FARR Act § 2242(a), 112 Stat. 2681-822 (\"It shall be the policy of the United States not to expel, extradite, or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, regardless of whether the person is physically present in the United States\"); see also Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85, Art. 3, S. Treaty Doc. No. 20, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 6 (1988) (\"No State Party shall expel, return (`refouler') or extradite a person <i>to another State</i> where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture\" (emphasis added)). It is not settled that the Act addresses the transfer of an individual located in Iraq to the Government of Iraq; arguably such an individual is not being \"returned\" to \"a country\"he is already there.\n</p>\n<p>Second, claims under the FARR Act may be limited to certain immigration proceedings. See § 2242(d), 112 Stat. 2681-822 (\"[N]othing in this section shall be construed as providing any court jurisdiction to consider or review claims raised under the Convention or this section, or any other determination made with respect to the application of the policy set forth in [this section], except as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to [8 U.S.C. § 1252 (2000 ed. and Supp. V])\").</p>\n\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b>128 S.Ct. 2207 (2008)</b></center>\n<center><h1>Mohammad MUNAF, et al., Petitioners,<br>\nv.<br>\nPete GEREN, Secretary of The Army, et al.<br>\nPete Geren, Secretary of The Army, et al., Petitioners,<br>\nv.<br>\nSandra K.

Letter, Jonathan H. Levy, Lewis S. Yelin, Washington, D.C., for Federal Parties.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Multinational Force-Iraq (MNF-I) is an international coalition force operating in Iraq composed of 26 different nations, including the United States. The force operates under the unified command of United States military officers, at the request of the Iraqi Government, and in accordance with United Nations (U.N.) Security Council Resolutions. Pursuant to the U.N. mandate, MNF-I forces detain individuals alleged to have committed hostile or warlike acts in Iraq, pending investigation and prosecution in Iraqi courts under Iraqi law.</p>\n<p>These consolidated cases concern the availability of habeas corpus relief arising from the MNF-I's detention of American citizens who voluntarily traveled to Iraq and are alleged to have committed crimes there. We are confronted with two questions. <i>First,</i> do United States courts have jurisdiction over habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of American citizens challenging their detention in Iraq by the MNF-I? <i>Second,</i> if such jurisdiction exists, may district courts exercise that jurisdiction to enjoin the MNF-I from transferring such individuals to Iraqi custody or allowing them to be tried before Iraqi courts?</p>\n<p>We conclude that the habeas statute extends to American citizens held overseas by American forces operating subject to an American chain of command, even when those forces are acting as part of a multinational coalition. Under circumstances such as those presented here, however, habeas corpus provides petitioners with no relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Pursuant to its U.N. mandate, the MNF-I has \"`the authority to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq.'\" App. G to Pet. for Cert. in 07-394, p. 74a, ¶ 10 (quoting U.N. Security Council, U.N. Doc. S/Res/1546, ¶ 10 (June 2004)). To this end, the MNF-I engages in a variety of military and humanitarian activities. The multinational force, for example, conducts combat operations against insurgent factions, trains and equips Iraqi security forces, and aids in relief and reconstruction efforts.</p>\n<p>MNF-I forces also detain individuals who pose a threat to the security of Iraq. The Government of Iraq retains ultimate responsibility for the arrest and imprisonment of individuals who violate its laws, but because many of Iraq's prison facilities have been destroyed, the MNF-I agreed to maintain physical custody of many such individuals during Iraqi criminal proceedings. MNF-I forces are currently holding approximately 24,000 detainees. An American military unit, Task Force 134, oversees detention operations and facilities in Iraq, including those located at Camp Cropper, the detention facility currently housing Shawqi Omar and Mohammad Munaf (hereinafter petitioners). The unit is under the command of United States <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2214</span> military officers who report to General David Petraeus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Shawqi Omar, an American-Jordanian citizen, voluntarily traveled to Iraq in 2002. In October 2004, Omar was captured and detained in Iraq by U.S. military forces operating as part of the MNF-I during a raid of his Baghdad home. Omar is believed to have provided aid to Abu Musab al-Zarqawithe late leader of al Qaeda in Iraqby facilitating his group's connection with other terrorist groups, bringing foreign fighters into Iraq, and planning and executing kidnappings in Iraq. MNF-I searched his home in an effort to capture and detain insurgents who were associated with al-Zarqawi. The raid netted an Iraqi insurgent and four Jordanian fighters along with explosive devices and other weapons.</p>\n<p>The captured insurgents gave sworn statements implicating Omar in insurgent cell activities. The four Jordanians testified that they had traveled to Iraq with Omar to commit militant acts against American and other Coalition Forces. Each of the insurgents stated that, while living in Omar's home, they had surveilled potential kidnap victims and conducted weapons training. The insurgents explained that Omar's fluency in English allowed him to lure foreigners to his home in order to kidnap and sell them for ransom.</p>\n<p>Following Omar's arrest, a three-member MNF-I Tribunal composed of American military officers concluded that Omar posed a threat to the security of Iraq and designated him a \"security internee.\" The tribunal also found that Omar had committed hostile and warlike acts, and that he was an enemy combatant in the war on terrorism. In accordance with Article 5 of the Geneva Convention, Omar was permitted to hear the basis for his detention, make a statement, and call immediately available witnesses.</p>\n<p>In addition to the review of his detention by the MNF-I Tribunal, Omar received a hearing before the Combined Review and Release Board (CRRB)a nine-member board composed of six representatives of the Iraqi Government and three MNF-I officers. The CRRB, like the MNF-I Tribunal, concluded that Omar's continued detention was necessary because he posed a threat to Iraqi security. At all times since his capture, Omar has remained in the custody of the United States military operating as part of the MNF-I.</p>\n<p>Omar's wife and son filed a next-friend petition for a writ of habeas corpus on Omar's behalf in the District Court for the District of Columbia. <i>Omar v. Harvey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186860\"><a href=\"/opinion/186860/omar-sandra-k-v-harvey-francis-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (C.A.D.C.2007). After the Department of Justice informed Omar that the MNF-I had decided to refer him to the Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI) for criminal proceedings, his attorney sought and obtained a preliminary injunction barring Omar's \"remov[al] ... from United States or MNF-I custody.\" App. to Pet. in No. 07-394, <i>supra,</i> at 59a. The order directed that</p>\n<blockquote>\"the [United States], their agents, servants, employees, confederates, and any persons acting in concert or participation with them, or having actual or implicit knowledge of this Order ... shall not remove [Omar] from United States or MNF-I custody, or take any other action inconsistent with this court's memorandum opinion.\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The United States appealed and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. <i>Omar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186860\"><a href=\"/opinion/186860/omar-sandra-k-v-harvey-francis-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>. The Court of Appeals first upheld the District Court's exercise of habeas jurisdiction, finding that this Court's decision in <i>Hirota v. MacArthur,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></span>, 69 S.Ct. 197, 93 L.Ed. 1902 (1948) (<i>per curiam</i>), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2215</span> did not preclude review. The Court of Appeals distinguished <i>Hirota</i> on the ground that Omar, unlike the petitioner in that case, had yet to be convicted by a foreign tribunal. 479 F.3d, at 7-9. The Court of Appeals recognized, however, that the writ of habeas corpus could not be used to enjoin release. <i>Id.,</i> at 11. It therefore construed the injunction only to bar transfer to Iraqi custody and upheld the District Court's order insofar as it prohibited the United States from: (1) transferring Omar to Iraqi custody, <i>id.,</i> at 11-13; (2) sharing details concerning any decision to release Omar with the Iraqi Government, <i>id.,</i> at 13; and (3) presenting Omar to the Iraqi Courts for investigation and prosecution, <i>id.,</i> at 14.</p>\n<p>Judge Brown dissented. She joined the panel's jurisdictional ruling, but would have vacated the injunction because, in her view, the District Court had no authority to enjoin a transfer that would allow Iraqi officials to take custody of an individual captured in Iraqsomething the Iraqi Government \"undeniably h[ad] a right to do.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 19. We granted certiorari. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 741, 169 L.Ed.2d 578 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Munaf, a citizen of both Iraq and the United States, voluntarily traveled to Iraq with several Romanian journalists. He was to serve as the journalists' translator and guide. Shortly after arriving in Iraq, the group was kidnapped and held captive for two months. After the journalists were freed, MNF-I forces detained Munaf based on their belief that he had orchestrated the kidnappings.</p>\n<p>A three-judge MNF-I Tribunal conducted a hearing to determine whether Munaf's detention was warranted. The MNF-I Tribunal reviewed the facts surrounding Munaf's capture, interviewed witnesses, and considered the available intelligence information. Munaf was present at the hearing and had an opportunity to hear the grounds for his detention, make a statement, and call immediately available witnesses. At the end of the hearing, the tribunal found that Munaf posed a serious threat to Iraqi security, designated him a \"security internee,\" and referred his case to the CCCI for criminal investigation and prosecution.</p>\n<p>During his CCCI trial, Munaf admitted on camera and in writing that he had facilitated the kidnapping of the Romanian journalists. He also appeared as a witness against his alleged co-conspirators. Later in the proceedings, Munaf recanted his confession, but the CCCI nonetheless found him guilty of kidnapping. On appeal, the Iraqi Court of Cassation vacated Munaf's conviction and remanded his case to the CCCI for further investigation. <i>In re Hikmat,</i> No. 19/Pub. Comm'n/2007, p. 5 (Feb. 19, 2008). The Court of Cassation directed that Munaf was to \"remain in custody pending the outcome\" of further criminal proceedings. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Munaf's sister filed a next-friend petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the District of Columbia. <i>Mohammed v. Harvey,</i> 456 F.Supp.2d 115, 118 (2006). The District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, finding that this Court's decision in <i>Hirota</i> controlled: Munaf was \"in the custody of coalition troops operating under the aegis of MNF-I, who derive their ultimate authority from the United Nations and the MNF-I member nations acting jointly.\" 456 F.Supp.2d, at 122.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186907\"><a href=\"/opinion/186907/munaf-mohammad-v-harvey-francis/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span> (2007) (hereinafter <i>Munaf</i>). The Court of Appeals, \"[c]onstrained by precedent,\" agreed with the District Court that <i>Hirota</i> controlled and dismissed Munaf's petition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2216</span> for lack of jurisdiction. 482 F.3d, at 583. It distinguished the prior opinion in <i>Omar</i> on the ground that Munaf, like the habeas petitioner in <i>Hirota</i> but unlike Omar, had been convicted by a foreign tribunal. 482 F.3d, at 583-584.</p>\n<p>Judge Randolph concurred in the judgment. <i>Id.,</i> at 585. He concluded that the District Court had improperly dismissed for want of jurisdiction because \"Munaf is an American citizen ... held by American forces overseas.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Nevertheless, Judge Randolph would have held that Munaf's habeas petition failed on the merits. <i>Id.,</i> at 586. He relied on this Court's holding in <i>Wilson v. Girard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105551\"><a href=\"/opinion/105551/wilson-v-girard/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>, 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409, 1 L.Ed.2d 1544 (1957), that a \"sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\" and concluded that the fact that the United States was holding Munaf because of his conviction by a foreign tribunal was conclusive. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari and consolidated the <i>Omar</i> and <i>Munaf</i> cases. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 741, 169 L.Ed.2d 578 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Solicitor General argues that the federal courts lack jurisdiction over the detainees' habeas petitions because the American forces holding Omar and Munaf operate as part of a multinational force. Brief for Federal Parties 17-36. The habeas statute provides that a federal district court may entertain a habeas application by a person held \"in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States,\" or \"in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241(c)(1), (3). MNF-I forces, the argument goes, \"are not operating solely under United States authority, but rather `as the agent of' a multinational force.\" Brief for Federal Parties 23 (quoting <i>Hirota, supra,</i> at 198, 69 S.Ct. 197). Omar and Munaf are thus held pursuant to international authority, not \"the authority of the United States,\" § 2241(c)(1), and they are therefore not within the reach of the habeas statute. Brief for Federal Parties 17-18.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The United States acknowledges that Omar and Munaf are American citizens held overseas in the immediate \"`physical custody'\" of American soldiers who answer only to an American chain of command. <i>Id.,</i> at 21. The MNF-I itself operates subject to a unified American command. <i>Id.,</i> at 23. \"[A]s a practical matter,\" the Government concedes, it is \"the President and the Pentagon, the Secretary of Defense, and the American commanders that control what ... American soldiers do,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 15, including the soldiers holding Munaf and Omar. In light of these admissions, it is unsurprising that the United States has never argued that it lacks the authority to release Munaf or Omar, or that it requires the consent of other countries to do so.</p>\n<p>We think these concessions the end of the jurisdictional inquiry. The Government's argumentthat the federal courts have no jurisdiction over American citizens held by American forces operating as multinational agentsis not easily reconciled with the text of § 2241(c)(1). See <i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269282/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 172, 121 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2217</span> S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001) (\"We begin, as always, with the language of the statute\"). That section applies to persons held \"in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States.\" § 2241(c)(1). An individual is held \"in custody\" by the United States when the United States official charged with his detention has \"the power to produce\" him. <i>Wales v. Whitney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91406\"><a href=\"/opinion/91406/wales-v-whitney/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 574, 5 S.Ct. 1050, 29 L.Ed. 277 (1885); see also § 2243 (\"The writ ... shall be directed to the person having custody of the person detained\"). The disjunctive \"or\" in § 2241(c)(1) makes clear that actual custody by the United States suffices for jurisdiction, even if that custody could be viewed as \"under ... color of\" another authority, such as the MNF-I.</p>\n<p>The Government's primary contention is that the District Courts lack jurisdiction in these cases because of this Court's decision in <i>Hirota.</i> That slip of a case cannot bear the weight the Government would place on it. In <i>Hirota,</i> Japanese citizens sought permission to file habeas corpus applications directly in this Court. The petitioners were noncitizens detained in Japan. They had been convicted and sentenced by the International Military Tribunal for the Far Eastan international tribunal established by General Douglas MacArthur acting, as the Court put it, in his capacity as \"the agent of the Allied Powers.\" 338 U.S., at 198, 69 S.Ct. 197. Although those familiar with the history of the period would appreciate the possibility of confusion over who General MacArthur took orders from, the Court concluded that the sentencing tribunal was \"not a tribunal of the United States.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Court then held that, \"[u]nder the foregoing circumstances,\" United States courts had \"no power or authority to review, to affirm, set aside or annul the judgments and sentences\" imposed by that tribunal. <i>Ibid.</i> Accordingly, the Court denied petitioners leave to file their habeas corpus applications, without further legal analysis. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Government argues that the multinational character of the MNF-I, like the multinational character of the tribunal at issue in <i>Hirota,</i> means that it too is not a United States entity subject to habeas. Reply Brief for Federal Parties 5-7. In making this claim, the Government acknowledges that the MNF-I is subject to American authority, but contends that the same was true of the tribunal at issue in <i>Hirota.</i> In <i>Hirota,</i> the Government notes, the petitioners were held by the United States Eighth Army, which took orders from General MacArthur, 338 U.S., at 199, 69 S.Ct. 197 (Douglas, J., concurring), and were subject to an \"unbroken\" chain of U.S. command, ending with the President of the United States, <i>id.,</i> at 207, 69 S.Ct. 197.</p>\n<p>The Court in <i>Hirota,</i> however, may have found it significant, in considering the nature of the tribunal established by General MacArthur, that the Solicitor General expressly contended that General MacArthur, as pertinent, was not subject to United States authority. The facts suggesting that the tribunal in <i>Hirota</i> was subject to an \"unbroken\" United States chain of command were not among the \"foregoing circumstances\" cited in the <i>per curiam</i> opinion disposing of the case, <i>id.,</i> at 198, 69 S.Ct. 197. They were highlighted only in Justice Douglas's belated opinion concurring in the result, published five months after that <i>per curiam. Id.,</i> at 199, n. *, 69 S.Ct. 197. Indeed, arguing before this Court, Solicitor General Perlman stated that General MacArthur did not serve \"under the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\" that his duty was \"to obey the directives of the Far Eastern Commission and not our War Department,\" and that \"no process that could be issued from this court ... would have any effect on his action.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2218</span> in <i>Hirota v. MacArthur</i><i>,</i> O.T.1948, No. 239, pp. 42, 50, 51. Here, in contrast, the Government acknowledges that our military commanders do answer to the President.</p>\n<p>Even if the Government is correct that the international authority at issue in <i>Hirota</i> is no different from the international authority at issue here, the present \"circumstances\" differ in another respect. These cases concern American citizens while <i>Hirota</i> did not, and the Court has indicated that habeas jurisdiction can depend on citizenship. See <i>Johnson v. Eisentrager,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104813\"><a href=\"/opinion/104813/johnson-v-eisentrager/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span>, 781, 70 S.Ct. 936, 94 L.Ed. 1255 (1950); <i>Rasul v.

See also <i>Munaf,</i> 482 F.3d, at 584 (\"[W]e do not mean to suggest that we find the logic of <i>Hirota</i> especially clear or compelling, particularly as applied to American citizens\"); <i>id.,</i> at 585 (Randolph, J., concurring in judgment).<sup>[3]</sup> \"Under the foregoing circumstances,\" we decline to extend our holding in <i>Hirota</i> to preclude American citizens held overseas by American soldiers subject to a United States chain of command from filing habeas petitions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We now turn to the question whether United States district courts may exercise their habeas jurisdiction to enjoin our Armed Forces from transferring individuals detained within another sovereign's territory to that sovereign's government for criminal prosecution. The nature of that question requires us to proceed \"with the circumspection appropriate when this Court is adjudicating issues inevitably entangled in the conduct of our international relations.\" <i>Romero v.

Here there is the further consideration that those issues arise in the context of ongoing military operations conducted by American Forces overseas. We therefore approach these questions cognizant that \"courts traditionally have been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military and national security affairs.\" <i>Department of Navy v.

Circuit upheld a preliminary injunction that, as interpreted by the Court of Appeals, prohibited the United States from (1) effectuating \"Omar's transfer <i>in any form,</i> whether by an official handoff or otherwise,\" to Iraqi custody, 479 F.3d, at 12; (2) sharing details concerning any decision to release Omar with the Iraqi Government, <i>id.,</i> at 13; and (3) \"presenting Omar to the [Iraqi courts] for trial,\" <i>id.,</i> at 14. This is not a narrow injunction. Even the habeas petitioners do not defend it in its entirety. They acknowledge the authority of the Iraqi courts to begin criminal proceedings against Omar and wisely concede that any injunction \"clearly need not include a bar on `information-sharing.'\" Brief for Habeas Petitioners 61. As Judge Brown noted in her dissent, such a bar would impermissibly \"enjoin the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2219</span> United States military from sharing information with an allied foreign sovereign in a war zone.\" <i>Omar, supra,</i> at 18.</p>\n<p>We begin with the basics. A preliminary injunction is an \"extraordinary and drastic remedy,\" 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M.

But one searches the opinions below in vain for any mention of a likelihood of success as to the merits of Omar's habeas petition. Instead, the District Court concluded that the \"<i>jurisdictional</i> issues\" presented questions \"so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberative investigation.\" <i>Omar v. Harvey,</i> 416 F.Supp.2d 19, 23-24, 27 (DC 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The D.C. Circuit made the same mistake. In that court's view, the \"only question before [it] at th[at] stage of the litigation relate[d] to the district court's jurisdiction.\" 479 F.3d, at 11. As a result, the Court of Appeals held that it \"need not address\" the merits of Omar's habeas claims: those merits had \"no relevance.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>A difficult question as to jurisdiction is, of course, no reason to grant a preliminary injunction. It says nothing about the \"likelihood of success on the merits,\" other than making such success more <i>unlikely</i> due to potential impediments to even reaching the merits. Indeed, if all a \"likelihood of success on the merits\" meant was that the district court likely had jurisdiction, then preliminary injunctions would be the rule, not the exception. In light of these basic principles, we hold that it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to grant a preliminary injunction on the view that the \"jurisdictional issues\" in Omar's case were tough, without even considering the merits of the underlying habeas petition.</p>\n<p>What we have said thus far would require reversal and remand in each of these cases: The lower courts in <i>Munaf</i> erred in dismissing for want of jurisdiction, and the lower courts in <i>Omar</i> erred in issuing and upholding the preliminary injunction. There are occasions, however, when it is appropriate to proceed further and address the merits. This is one of them.</p>\n<p>Our authority to address the merits of the habeas petitioners' claims is clear. Review of a preliminary injunction \"is not confined to the act of granting the injunctio[n], but extends as well to determining whether there is any insuperable objection, in point of jurisdiction or merits, to the maintenance of [the] bill, and, if so, to directing a final decree dismissing it.\" <i>City and County of Denver v.

For the reasons we explain below, the relief sought by the habeas petitioners makes clear under our precedents that the power of the writ ought not to be exercised. Because the Government is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, it is appropriate for us to terminate the litigation now.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The habeas petitioners argue that the writ should be granted in their cases because they have \"a legally enforceable right\" not to be transferred to Iraqi authority for criminal proceedings under both the Due Process Clause and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARR Act), div. G, 112 Stat. 2681-761, and because they are innocent civilians who have been unlawfully detained by the United States in violation of the Due Process Clause. Brief for Habeas Petitioners 48-52. With respect to the transfer claim, petitioners request an injunction prohibiting the United States from transferring them to Iraqi custody. With respect to the unlawful detention claim, petitioners seek \"release\"but only to the extent that release would not result in \"unlawful\" transfer to Iraqi custody. Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Both of these requests would interfere with Iraq's sovereign right to \"punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders.\" <i>Wilson,</i> 354 U.S., at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409. We accordingly hold that the detainees' claims do not state grounds upon which habeas relief may be granted, that the habeas petitions should have been promptly dismissed, and that no injunction should have been entered.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Habeas corpus is \"governed by equitable principles.\" <i>Fay v.

The habeas statute provides only that a writ of habeas corpus \"<i>may</i> be granted,\" § 2241(a) (emphasis added), and directs federal courts to \"dispose of [habeas petitions] as law and justice require,\" § 2243. See <i>Danforth v. Minnesota,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 169 L.Ed.2d 859 (2008). Likewise, the writ did not issue in England \"as of mere course,\" but rather required the petitioner to demonstrate why the \"extraordinary power of the crown\" should be exercised, 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 132 (1768); even then, courts were directed to \"do as to justice shall appertain,\" 1 <i>id.,</i> at 131 (1765). The question, therefore, even where a habeas court has the power to issue the writ, is \"whether this be a case in which [that power] ought to be exercised.\" <i>Ex parte Watkins,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span>, 201, 7 L.Ed. 650 (1830) (Marshall, C. J.).</p>\n<p>At the outset, the nature of the relief sought by the habeas petitioners suggests that habeas is not appropriate in these cases. Habeas is at its core a remedy for unlawful executive detention. <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137001\"><a href=\"/opinion/137001/hamdi-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 536, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004) (plurality opinion). The typical remedy for such detention is, of course, release. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Preiser v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108772\"><a href=\"/opinion/108772/preiser-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, 484, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (\"[T]he traditional function of the writ is to secure release from illegal custody\"). But here the last thing petitioners want is simple release; that would expose them to apprehension by Iraqi authorities for criminal prosecutionprecisely what petitioners went to federal court to avoid. At the end of the day, what petitioners are really after is a court order requiring the United States to shelter them from the sovereign government seeking to have them answer for alleged crimes committed within that sovereign's borders.</p>\n<p>The habeas petitioners do not dispute that they voluntarily traveled to Iraq, that they remain detained within the sovereign territory of Iraq today, or that they are alleged to have committed serious crimes in Iraq. Indeed, Omar and Munaf both concede that, if they were not in MNF-I custody, Iraq would be free to arrest and prosecute them under Iraqi law. See Tr. in <i>Omar,</i> No. 06-5126 (CADC), pp. 48-49, 59 (Sept. 11, 2006); Tr. in <i>Mohammed,</i> No. 06-1455(DC), pp. 15-16 (Oct. 10, 2006). There is, moreover, no question that Munaf is the subject of ongoing Iraqi criminal proceedings and that Omar would be but for the present injunction. Munaf was convicted by the CCCI, and while that conviction was overturned on appeal, his case was remanded to and is again pending before the CCCI. The MNF-I referred Omar to the CCCI for prosecution at which point he sought and obtained an injunction that prohibits his prosecution. See 479 F.3d, at 16, n. 3 (Brown, J., dissenting in part) (\"`[Omar] has not yet had a trial or even an investigative hearing in the CCCI due to the district court's unprecedented injunction'\" (citing Opposition to Petitioner's Emergency Motion for Injunctive Relief 18-19, in <i>Munaf v. Harvey,</i> No. 06-5324 (CADC, Oct. 25, 2006))).</p>\n<p>Given these facts, our cases make clear that Iraq has a sovereign right to prosecute Omar and Munaf for crimes committed on its soil. As Chief Justice Marshall explained nearly two centuries ago, \"[t]he jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute.\" <i>Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon,</i> 7 Cranch 116, 136, 3 L.Ed. 287 (1812). See <i>Wilson, supra,</i> at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409 (\"A sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2222</span> laws committed within its borders, unless it expressly or impliedly consents to surrender its jurisdiction\"); <i>Reid v.

We disagree. Not only have we long recognized the principle that a nation state reigns sovereign within its own territory, we have twice applied that principle to reject claims that the Constitution precludes the Executive from transferring a prisoner to a foreign country for prosecution in an allegedly unconstitutional trial.</p>\n<p>In <i>Wilson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105551\"><a href=\"/opinion/105551/wilson-v-girard/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>, 77 S.Ct. 1409, 1 L.Ed.2d 1544, we reversed an injunction similar to the one at issue here. During a cavalry exercise at the Camp Weir range in Japan, Girard, a Specialist Third Class in the United States Army, caused the death of a Japanese woman. <i>Id.,</i> at 525-526, 77 S.Ct. 1409. After Japan indicted Girard, but while he was still in United States custody, Girard filed a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. <i>Ibid.</i> The District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the United States, enjoining the \"proposed delivery of [Girard] to the Japanese Government.\" <i>Girard v. Wilson,</i> 152 F.Supp. 21, 27 (DC 1957). In the District Court's view, to permit the transfer to Japanese authority would violate the rights guaranteed to Girard by the Constitution. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, and vacated the injunction. 354 U.S., at 529-530, 77 S.Ct. 1409. We noted that Japan had exclusive jurisdiction \"to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\" unless it had surrendered that jurisdiction. <i>Id.,</i> at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409. Consequently, even though Japan had ceded some of its jurisdiction to the United States pursuant to a bilateral Status of Forces Agreement, the United States could waive that jurisdictionas it had done in Girard's caseand the habeas court was without authority to enjoin Girard's transfer to the Japanese authorities. <i>Id.,</i> at 529-530, 77 S.Ct. 1409.</p>\n<p>Likewise, in <i>Neely v. Henkel, supra</i><i>,</i> this Court held that habeas corpus was not available to defeat the criminal jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign, even when application of that sovereign's law would allegedly violate the Constitution. Neelythe habeas petitioner and an American citizen was accused of violating Cuban law in Cuba. <i>Id.,</i> at 112-113, 21 S.Ct. 302. He was arrested and detained in the United States. <i>Id.,</i> at 113, 21 S.Ct. 302. The United States indicated its intent to extradite him, and Neely filed suit seeking to block his extradition on the grounds that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2223</span> Cuban law did not provide the panoply of rights guaranteed him by the Constitution of the United States. <i>Id.,</i> at 122, 21 S.Ct. 302. We summarily rejected this claim: \"The answer to this suggestion is that those [constitutional] provisions have no relation to crimes committed without the jurisdiction of the United States against the laws of a foreign country.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Neely alleged no claim for which a \"discharge on <i>habeas corpus</i>\" could issue. <i>Id.,</i> at 125, 21 S.Ct. 302. Accordingly, the United States was free to transfer him to Cuban custody for prosecution.</p>\n<p>In the present cases, the habeas petitioners concede that Iraq has the sovereign authority to prosecute them for alleged violations of its law, yet nonetheless request an injunction prohibiting the United States from transferring them to Iraqi custody. But as the foregoing cases make clear, habeas is not a means of compelling the United States to harbor fugitives from the criminal justice system of a sovereign with undoubted authority to prosecute them.</p>\n<p>Petitioners' \"release\" claim adds nothing to their \"transfer\" claim. That claim fails for the same reasons the transfer claim fails, given that the release petitioners seek is release in a form that would avoid transfer. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47-48; App. 40 (coupling Munaf's claim for release with a request for order requiring the United States to bring him to a U.S. court); App. 123 (same with respect to Omar). Such \"release\" would impermissibly interfere with Iraq's \"exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\" <i>Wilson, supra,</i> at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409; the \"release\" petitioners seek is nothing less than an order commanding our forces to smuggle them out of Iraq. Indeed, the Court of Appeals in Omar's case took the extraordinary step of upholding an injunction that prohibited the Executive from releasing Omarthe quintessential habeas remedyif the United States shared information about his release with its military ally, Iraq. 479 F.3d, at 13. Habeas does not require the United States to keep an unsuspecting nation in the dark when it releases an alleged criminal insurgent within its borders.</p>\n<p>Moreover, because Omar and Munaf are being held by United States Armed Forces at the behest of the Iraqi Government pending their prosecution in Iraqi courts, <i>Mohammed,</i> 456 F.Supp.2d, at 117, release of <i>any</i> kind would interfere with the sovereign authority of Iraq \"to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\" <i>Wilson, supra,</i> at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409. This point becomes clear given that the MNF-I, pursuant to its U.N. mandate, is authorized to \"take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq,\" App. G to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07-394, p. 74a, ¶ 10, and specifically to provide for the \"internment [of individuals in Iraq] where this is necessary for imperative reasons of security,\" <i>id.,</i> at 86a.</p>\n<p>While the Iraqi Government is ultimately \"responsible for [the] arrest, detention and imprisonment\" of individuals who violate its laws, S.C. Res. 1790, Annex I, ¶ 4, p. 6, U.N. Doc. S/RES/1790 (Dec. 18, 2007), the MNF-I maintains physical custody of individuals like Munaf and Omar while their cases are being heard by the CCCI, <i>Mohammed, supra,</i> at 117. Indeed, Munaf is currently held at Camp Cropper pursuant to the express order of the Iraqi Courts. See <i>In re Hikmat,</i> No. 19/Pub. Comm'n/2007, at 5 (directing that Munaf \"remain in custody pending the outcome\" of further Iraqi proceedings). As that court order makes clear, MNF-I detention is an integral part of the Iraqi system of criminal justice. MNF-I forces <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2224</span> augment the Iraqi Government's peacekeeping efforts by functioning, in essence, as its jailor. Any requirement that the MNF-I release a detainee would, in effect, impose a release order on the Iraqi Government.</p>\n<p>The habeas petitioners acknowledge that <i>some</i> interference with a foreign criminal system is too much. They concede that \"it is axiomatic that an American court does not provide collateral review of proceedings in a foreign tribunal.\" Brief for Habeas Petitioners 39 (citing <i>Republic of Austria v. Altmann,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134749\"><a href=\"/opinion/134749/republicof-austria-v-altmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span>, 700, 124 S.Ct. 2240, 159 L.Ed.2d 1 (2004)). We agree, but see no reason why habeas corpus should permit a prisoner detained within a foreign sovereign's territory to prevent a trial from going forward in the first place. It did not matter that the habeas petitioners in <i>Wilson</i> and <i>Neely</i> had not been convicted. 354 U.S., at 525-526, 77 S.Ct. 1409, 180 U.S., at 112-113, 21 S.Ct. 302. Rather, \"the same principles of comity and respect for foreign sovereigns that preclude judicial scrutiny of foreign convictions necessarily render invalid attempts to shield citizens from foreign prosecution in order to preempt such nonreviewable adjudications.\" <i>Omar,</i> 479 F.3d, at 17 (Brown, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>To allow United States courts to intervene in an ongoing foreign criminal proceeding and pass judgment on its legitimacy seems at least as great an intrusion as the plainly barred collateral review of foreign convictions.

Yet in those cases we held that the Constitution allows the Executive to transfer American citizens to foreign authorities for criminal prosecution. It would be passing strange to hold that the Executive lacks that same authority where, as here, the detainees were captured by our Armed Forces for engaging in serious hostile acts against an ally in what the Government refers to as \"an active theater of combat.\" Brief for Federal Parties 16.</p>\n<p>Such a conclusion would implicate not only concerns about interfering with a sovereign's recognized prerogative to apply its criminal law to those alleged to have committed crimes within its borders, but also concerns about unwarranted judicial intrusion into the Executive's ability to conduct military operations abroad.

Those who commit crimes within a sovereign's territory may be transferred to that sovereign's government for prosecution; there is hardly an exception to that rule when the crime at issue is not embezzlement but unlawful insurgency directed against an ally during ongoing hostilities involving our troops.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Petitioners contend that these general principles are trumped in their cases because their transfer to Iraqi custody is likely to result in torture. This allegation was raised in Munaf's petition for habeas, App. 39, ¶ 46, but not in Omar's. Such allegations are of course a matter of serious concern, but in the present context that concern is to be addressed by the political branches, not the judiciary. See M. Bassiouni, International Extradition: United States Law and Practice 921 (2007) (\"<i>Habeas corpus</i> has been held not to be a valid means of inquiry into the treatment the relator is anticipated to receive in the requesting state\").</p>\n<p>This conclusion is reflected in the cases already cited. Even with respect to claims that detainees would be denied constitutional rights if transferred, we have recognized that it is for the political branches, not the judiciary, to assess practices in foreign countries and to determine national policy in light of those assessments. Thus, the Court in <i>Neely</i> concluded that an American citizen who \"commits a crime in a foreign country\" \"cannot complain if required to submit to such modes of trial and to such punishment as the laws of that country may prescribe for its own people,\" but went on to explain that this was true \"unless a different mode be provided for by treaty stipulation between that country and the United States.\" 180 U.S., at 123, 21 S.Ct. 302. Diplomacy was the means of addressing the petitioner's concerns.</p>\n<p>By the same token, while the Court in <i>Wilson</i> stated the general principle that a \"sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\" it recognized that this rule could be altered by diplomatic agreement in light of particular concerns as it was in that caseand by a decision of the Executive to waive jurisdiction granted under that agreementas it was in that case. 354 U.S., at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409. See also <i>Kinsella,</i> 351 U.S., at 479, 76 S.Ct. 886 (alteration of jurisdictional rule through \"carefully drawn agreements\"). This recognition that it is the political branches that bear responsibility for creating exceptions to the general rule is nothing new; as Chief Justice Marshall explained in the <i>Schooner Exchange,</i> \"exemptions from territorial jurisdiction ... must be derived from the consent of the sovereign of the territory\" and are \"rather questions of policy than of law, that they are for diplomatic, rather than legal discussion.\" 7 Cranch, at 143, 146, 3 L.Ed. 287. The present concerns are of the same nature as the loss of constitutional rights alleged in <i>Wilson</i> and <i>Neely,</i> and are governed by the same principles.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2226</span> The Executive Branch may, of course, decline to surrender a detainee for many reasons, including humanitarian ones. Petitioners here allege only the possibility of mistreatment in a prison facility; this is not a more extreme case in which the Executive has determined that a detainee is likely to be tortured but decides to transfer him anyway. Indeed, the Solicitor General states that it is the policy of the United States <i>not</i> to transfer an individual in circumstances where torture is likely to result. Brief for Federal Parties 47; Reply Brief for Federal Parties 23. In these cases the United States explains that, although it remains concerned about torture among some sectors of the Iraqi Government, the State Department has determined that the Justice Ministrythe department that would have authority over Munaf and Omaras well as its prison and detention facilities have \"`generally met internationally accepted standards for basic prisoner needs.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Solicitor General explains that such determinations are based on \"the Executive's assessment of the foreign country's legal system and... the Executive['s] ... ability to obtain foreign assurances it considers reliable.\" Brief for Federal Parties 47.</p>\n<p>The Judiciary is not suited to second-guess such determinationsdeterminations that would require federal courts to pass judgment on foreign justice systems and undermine the Government's ability to speak with one voice in this area. See The Federalist No. 42, p. 279 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (\"If we are to be one nation in any respect, it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations\"). In contrast, the political branches are well situated to consider sensitive foreign policy issues, such as whether there is a serious prospect of torture at the hands of an ally, and what to do about it if there is. As Judge Brown noted, \"we need not assume the political branches are oblivious to these concerns. Indeed, the other branches possess significant diplomatic tools and leverage the judiciary lacks.\" 479 F.3d, at 20, n. 6 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>Petitioners briefly argue that their claims of potential torture may not be readily dismissed on the basis of these principles because the FARR Act prohibits transfer when torture may result. Brief for Habeas Petitioners 51-52. Neither petitioner asserted a FARR Act claim in his petition for habeas, and the Act was not raised in any of the certiorari filings before this Court. Even in their merits brief in this Court, the habeas petitioners hardly discuss the issue. <i>Id.,</i> at 17, 51-52, 57-58. The Government treats the issue in kind. Reply Brief for Federal Parties 24-26. Under such circumstances we will not consider the question.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2227</span> 2</h2>\n<p>Finally, the habeas petitioners raise the additional argument that the United States may not transfer a detainee to Iraqi custody, not because it would be unconstitutional to do so, but because the \"[G]overnment may not transfer a citizen without legal authority.\" Brief for Habeas Petitioners 54. The United States, they claim, bears the burden of \"identify[ing] a treaty or statute that permits it to transfer the[m] to Iraqi custody.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 49.</p>\n<p>The habeas petitioners rely prominently on <i>Valentine v. United States ex rel. Neidecker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102684\"><a href=\"/opinion/102684/valentine-v-united-states-ex-rel-neidecker/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 57 S.Ct. 100, 81 L.Ed. 5 (1936), where we ruled that the Executive may not extradite a person held within the United States unless \"legal authority\" to do so \"is given by act of Congress or by the terms of a treaty,\" <i>id.,</i> at 9, 57 S.Ct. 100. But <i>Valentine</i> is readily distinguishable. It involved the extradition of an individual from the United States; this is not an extradition case, but one involving the transfer to a sovereign's authority of an individual captured and already detained in that sovereign's territory. In the extradition context, when a \"fugitive criminal\" is found within the United States, \"`there is no authority vested in any department of the government to seize [him] and surrender him to a foreign power,'\" in the absence of a pertinent constitutional or legislative provision. <i>Ibid.</i> But Omar and Munaf voluntarily traveled to Iraq and are being held there. They are therefore subject to the territorial jurisdiction of that sovereign, not of the United States. Moreover, as we have explained, the petitioners are being held by the United States, acting as part of MNF-I, at the request of and on behalf of the Iraqi Government. It would be more than odd if the Government had no authority to transfer them to the very sovereign on whose behalf, and within whose territory, they are being detained.</p>\n<p>The habeas petitioners further contend that this Court's decision in <i>Wilson</i> supports their argument that the Executive lacks the discretion to transfer a citizen absent a treaty or statute. Brief for Habeas Petitioners 54-55. Quite the opposite. <i>Wilson</i> forecloses it. The only \"authority\" at issue in <i>Wilson</i>a Status of Forces Agreementseemed to give the habeas petitioner in that case a right to be tried by an American military tribunal, not a Japanese court. 354 U.S., at 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409. Nevertheless, in light of the background principle that Japan had a sovereign interest in prosecuting crimes committed within its borders, this Court found no \"constitutional or statutory\" impediment to the United States's waiver of its jurisdiction under the agreement. <i>Id.,</i> at 530, 77 S.Ct. 1409.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Munaf and Omar are alleged to have committed hostile and warlike acts within the sovereign territory of Iraq during ongoing hostilities there. Pending their criminal prosecution for those offenses, Munaf and Omar are being held in Iraq by American forces operating pursuant to a U.N. Mandate and at the request of the Iraqi Government. Petitioners concede that Iraq has a sovereign right to prosecute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2228</span> them for alleged violations of its law. Yet they went to federal court seeking an order that would allow them to defeat precisely that sovereign authority. Habeas corpus does not require the United States to shelter such fugitives from the criminal justice system of the sovereign with authority to prosecute them.</p>\n<p>For all the reasons given above, petitioners state no claim in their habeas petitions for which relief can be granted, and those petitions should have been promptly dismissed. The judgments below and the injunction entered against the United States are vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice GINSBURG and Justice BREYER join, concurring.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that \"[u]nder circumstances such as those presented here, ... habeas corpus provides petitioners with no relief.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2213. The Court's opinion makes clear that those circumstances include the following: (1) Omar and Munaf \"voluntarily traveled to Iraq.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2221. They are being held (2) in the \"territory\" of (3) an \"all[y]\" of the United States, <i>ante,</i> at 2224, (4) by our troops, see <i>ante,</i> at 2216-2217, (5) \"during ongoing hostilities\" that (6) \"involv[e] our troops,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2224. (7) The government of a foreign sovereign, Iraq, has decided to prosecute them \"for crimes committed on its soil.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2221. And (8) \"the State Department has determined that ... the department that would have authority over Munaf and Omar ... as well as its prison and detention facilities have generally met internationally accepted standards for basic prisoner needs.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2226 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because I consider these circumstances essential to the Court's holding, I join its opinion.</p>\n<p>The Court accordingly reserves judgment on an \"extreme case in which the Executive has determined that a detainee [in United States custody] is likely to be tortured but decides to transfer him anyway.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2225-2226. I would add that nothing in today's opinion should be read as foreclosing relief for a citizen of the United States who resists transfer, say, from the American military to a foreign government for prosecution in a case of that sort, and I would extend the caveat to a case in which the probability of torture is well documented, even if the Executive fails to acknowledge it. Although the Court rightly points out that any likelihood of extreme mistreatment at the receiving government's hands is a proper matter for the political branches to consider, see <i>ante,</i> at 2225-2226, if the political branches did favor transfer it would be in order to ask whether substantive due process bars the Government from consigning its own people to torture. And although the Court points out that habeas is aimed at securing release, not protective detention, see <i>ante,</i> at 2221, habeas would not be the only avenue open to an objecting prisoner; \"where federally protected rights [are threatened], it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief,\" <i>Bell v. Hood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104272\"><a href=\"/opinion/104272/bell-v-hood/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span>, 684, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946).</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  As noted above, Munaf's conviction was subsequently vacated by an Iraqi appellate court, and he is awaiting a new trial.</p>\n<p>[2]  These cases concern only American citizens and only the statutory reach of the writ. Nothing herein addresses jurisdiction with respect to alien petitioners or with respect to the constitutional scope of the writ.</p>\n<p>[3]  The circumstances in <i>Hirota</i> differ in yet another respect. The petitioners in that case sought an original writ, filing their motions for leave to file habeas petitions \"in this Court.\" 338 U.S., at 198, 69 S.Ct. 197. There is, however, some authority for the proposition that this Court has original subject-matter jurisdiction only over \"`cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party,'\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 174, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803) (quoting U.S. Const., Art. III, § 2, cl. 2), and Congress had not granted the Court appellate jurisdiction to review decisions of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.</p>\n<p>[4]  The habeas petitioners claim that the injunction only bars Omar's presentation to the Iraqi courts and that the CCCI trial can go forward in Omar's absence. The injunction is not so easily narrowed. It was entered on the theory that Omar might be \"presented to the CCCI and in that same day, be tried, [and] convicted,\" thus depriving the United States district courts of jurisdiction. <i>Omar v. Harvey,</i> 416 F.Supp.2d 19, 29 (DC 2006). Petitioners' interpretation makes no sense under that theory: If a conviction would deprive the habeas court of jurisdiction, a trial, with or without the defendant, could result in just such a jurisdiction-divesting order.</p>\n<p>[5]  The United States has in fact entered into treaties that provide procedural protections to American citizens tried in other nations. See, <i>e.g.,</i> North Atlantic Treaty: Status of Forces, June 19, 1951, 4 U.S.T. 1802, T.I.A.S. No. 2846, Art. VII, ¶ 9 (guaranteeing arrested members of the Armed Forces and their civilian dependents, <i>inter alia,</i> an attorney, an interpreter, and a prompt and speedy trial, as well as the right to confront witnesses, obtain favorable witnesses, and communicate with a representative of the United States).</p>\n<p>[6]  We hold that these habeas petitions raise no claim for relief under the FARR Act and express no opinion on whether Munaf and Omar may be permitted to amend their respective pleadings to raise such a claim on remand. Even if considered on the merits, several issues under the FARR Act claim would have to be addressed. First, the Act speaks to situations where a detainee is being \"returned\" to \"a country.\" FARR Act § 2242(a), 112 Stat. 2681-822 (\"It shall be the policy of the United States not to expel, extradite, or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, regardless of whether the person is physically present in the United States\"); see also Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85, Art. 3, S. Treaty Doc. No. 20, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 6 (1988) (\"No State Party shall expel, return (`refouler') or extradite a person <i>to another State</i> where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture\" (emphasis added)). It is not settled that the Act addresses the transfer of an individual located in Iraq to the Government of Iraq; arguably such an individual is not being \"returned\" to \"a country\"he is already there.\n</p>\n<p>Second, claims under the FARR Act may be limited to certain immigration proceedings. See § 2242(d), 112 Stat. 2681-822 (\"[N]othing in this section shall be construed as providing any court jurisdiction to consider or review claims raised under the Convention or this section, or any other determination made with respect to the application of the policy set forth in [this section], except as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to [8 U.S.C. § 1252 (2000 ed. and Supp. V])\").</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 145797, "judges": "Roberts", "local_path": "pdf/2008/06/12/Munaf_v._Geren.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2007                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued March 25, 2008—Decided June 12, 2008*\nThe Multinational Force–Iraq (MNF–I) is an international coalition\n  force composed of 26 nations, including the United States. It oper-\n  ates in Iraq under the unified command of U. S. military officers, at\n  the Iraqi Government’s request, and in accordance with United Na-\n  tions Security Council Resolutions. Pursuant to the U. N. mandate,\n  MNF–I forces detain individuals alleged to have committed hostile or\n  warlike acts in Iraq, pending investigation and prosecution in Iraqi\n  courts under Iraqi law.\n     Shawqi Omar and Mohammad Munaf (hereinafter petitioners) are\n  American citizens who voluntarily traveled to Iraq and allegedly\n  committed crimes there. They were each captured by military forces\n  operating as part of the MNF–I; given hearings before MNF–I Tribu-\n  nals composed of American officers, who concluded that petitioners\n  posed threats to Iraq’s security; and placed in the custody of the U. S.\n  military operating as part of the MNF-I. Family members filed next-\n  friend habeas corpus petitions on behalf of both petitioners in the\n  United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\n     In Omar’s case, after the Department of Justice informed Omar\n  that the MNF–I had decided to refer him to the Central Criminal\n  Court of Iraq for criminal proceedings, his attorney sought and ob-\n  tained a preliminary injunction from the District Court barring\n  Omar’s removal from United States or MNF-I custody. Affirming,\n  the D. C. Circuit first upheld the District Court’s exercise of habeas\n  jurisdiction, finding that Hirota v. MacArthur, 338 U. S. 197, did not\n——————\n  * Together with No. 07–394, Geren, Secretary of the Army, et al. v.\nOmar et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n2                           MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    preclude review because Omar, unlike the habeas petitioners in Hi-\n    rota, had yet to be convicted by a foreign tribunal.\n       Meanwhile, the District Court in Munaf’s case dismissed his ha-\n    beas petition for lack of jurisdiction. The court concluded that Hirota\n    controlled and required that the petition be dismissed for lack of ju-\n    risdiction because the American forces holding Munaf were operating\n    as part of an international force—the MNF-I. The D. C. Circuit\n    agreed and affirmed. It distinguished its prior decision in Omar,\n    which upheld jurisdiction over Omar’s habeas petition, on the\n    grounds that Munaf had been convicted by a foreign tribunal while\n    Omar had not.\nHeld:\n    1. The habeas statute extends to American citizens held overseas\n by American forces operating subject to an American chain of com-\n mand. The Government’s argument that the federal courts lack ju-\n risdiction over the detainees’ habeas petitions in such circumstances\n because the American forces holding Omar and Munaf operate as\n part of a multinational force is rejected. The habeas statute, 28\n U. S. C. §2241(c)(1), applies to persons held “in custody under or by\n color of the authority of the United States.” The disjunctive “or” in\n §2241(c)(1) makes clear that actual Government custody suffices for\n jurisdiction, even if that custody could be viewed as “under . . . color\n of” another authority, such as the MNF–I.\n    The Court also rejects the Government’s contention that the Dis-\n trict Court lacks jurisdiction in these cases because the multinational\n character of the MNF–I, like the multinational character of the tri-\n bunal at issue in Hirota, means that the MNF-I is not a United\n States entity subject to habeas. The present cases differ from Hirota\n in several respects. The Court in Hirota may have found it signifi-\n cant, in considering the nature of the tribunal established by General\n MacArthur, that in that case the Government argued that General\n MacArthur was not subject to United States authority, that his duty\n was to obey the Far Eastern Commission and not the U. S. War De-\n partment, and that no process this Court could issue would have any\n effect on his action. Here, in contrast, the Government acknowl-\n edges that U. S. military commanders answer to the President.\n These cases also differ from Hirota in that they concern American\n citizens, and the Court has indicated that habeas jurisdiction can de-\n pend on citizenship. See e.g., Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763,\n 781. Pp. 7–11.\n    2. Federal district courts, however, may not exercise their habeas\n jurisdiction to enjoin the United States from transferring individuals\n alleged to have committed crimes and detained within the territory of\n a foreign sovereign to that sovereign for criminal prosecution.

C. Circuit interpreted as prohib-\niting the Government from (1) transferring Omar to Iraqi custody, (2)\nsharing with the Iraqi Government details concerning any decision to\nrelease him, and (3) presenting him to the Iraqi courts for investiga-\ntion and prosecution, without even considering the merits of the ha-\nbeas petition. A preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary and\ndrastic remedy.” It should never be awarded as of right, Yakus v.\nUnited States, 321 U. S. 414, 440, and requires a demonstration of,\ninter alia, “a likelihood of success on the merits,” Gonzales v. O\nCentro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418, 428.\nBut neither the District Court nor the D. C. Circuit considered the\nlikelihood of success as to the merits of Omar’s habeas petition. In-\nstead, the lower courts concluded that the “jurisdictional issues” im-\nplicated by Omar’s petition presented difficult and substantial ques-\ntions. A difficult question as to jurisdiction is, of course, no reason to\ngrant a preliminary injunction.\n   The foregoing analysis would require reversal and remand in each\nof these cases: The lower courts in Munaf erred in dismissing for\nwant of jurisdiction, and the lower courts in Omar erred in issuing\nand upholding the preliminary injunction. Our review of a prelimi-\nnary injunction, however, “is not confined to the act of granting the\ninjunctio[n].” City and County of Denver v. New York Trust Co., 229\nU. S. 123, 136. Rather, a reviewing court has the power on appeal\nfrom an interlocutory order “to examine the merits of the case . . . and\nupon deciding them in favor of the defendant to dismiss the bill.”\nNorth Carolina R. Co. v. Story, 268 U. S. 288, 292. In short, there are\noccasions when it is appropriate for a court reviewing a preliminary\ninjunction to proceed to the merits; given that the present cases im-\nplicate sensitive foreign policy issues in the context of ongoing mili-\ntary operations, this is one of them. Pp. 11–14.\n     (b) Petitioners argue that they are entitled to habeas relief be-\ncause they have a legally enforceable right not to be transferred to\nIraqi authorities for criminal proceedings and because they are inno-\ncent civilians unlawfully detained by the Government. With respect\nto the transfer claim, they request an injunction prohibiting the Gov-\nernment from transferring them to Iraqi custody. With respect to the\nunlawful detention claim, they seek release but only to the extent it\nwould not result in unlawful transfer to Iraqi custody. Because both\nrequests would interfere with Iraq’s sovereign right to “punish of-\n4                           MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    fenses against its laws committed within its borders,” Wilson v. Gi­\n    rard, 354 U. S. 524, 529, petitioners’ claims do not state grounds\n    upon which habeas relief may be granted. Their habeas petitions\n    should have been promptly dismissed and no injunction should have\n    been entered. Pp. 14–28.\n           (1) Habeas is governed by equitable principles. Thus, pruden-\n    tial concerns may “require a federal court to forgo the exercise of its\n    habeas . . . power.” Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536, 539. Here,\n    the unusual nature of the relief sought by petitioners suggests that\n    habeas is not appropriate. Habeas is at its core a remedy for unlaw-\n    ful executive detention. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 536. The\n    typical remedy is, of course, release. See, e.g., Preiser v. Rodriguez,\n    411 U. S. 475, 484. But the habeas petitioners in these cases do not\n    want simple release; that would expose them to apprehension by\n    Iraqi authorities for criminal prosecution—precisely what they went\n    to federal court to avoid.\n       The habeas petitioners do not dispute that they voluntarily trav-\n    eled to Iraq, that they remain detained within the sovereign territory\n    of Iraq today, or that they are alleged to have committed serious\n    crimes in Iraq. Indeed, Omar and Munaf both concede that, if they\n    were not in MNF–I custody, Iraq would be free to arrest and prose-\n    cute them under Iraqi law. Further, Munaf is the subject of ongoing\n    Iraqi criminal proceedings and Omar would be but for the present in-\n    junction. Given these facts, Iraq has a sovereign right to prosecute\n    them for crimes committed on its soil, even if its criminal process\n    does not come with all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, see\n    Neely v. Henkel, 180 U. S. 109, 123. As Chief Justice Marshall ex-\n    plained nearly two centuries ago, “[t]he jurisdiction of the nation\n    within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute.”\n    Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 136.\n       This Court has twice applied that principle in rejecting claims that\n    the Constitution precludes the Executive from transferring a prisoner\n    to a foreign country for prosecution in an allegedly unconstitutional\n    trial. Wilson, supra, at 529–530; Neely, supra, at 112–113, 122.\n    Omar and Munaf concede that Iraq has a sovereign right to prosecute\n    them for alleged violations of its law. Yet they went to federal court\n    seeking an order that would allow them to defeat precisely that sov-\n    ereign authority. But habeas corpus does not bar the United States\n    from transferring a prisoner to the sovereign authority he concedes\n    has a right to prosecute him. Petitioners’ “release” claim adds noth-\n    ing to their “transfer” claim and fails for the same reasons, given that\n    the release they seek is release that would avoid transfer.\n       There is of course even more at issue here: Neely involved a charge\n    of embezzlement and Wilson the peacetime actions of a serviceman.\n                      Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                      5\n\n                                 Syllabus\n  The present cases concern individuals captured and detained within\n  an ally’s territory during ongoing hostilities involving our troops. It\n  would be very odd to hold that the Executive can transfer individuals\n  such as those in the Neely and Wilson cases, but cannot transfer to an\n  ally detainees captured by our Armed Forces for engaging in serious\n  hostile acts against that ally in what the Government refers to as “an\n  active theater of combat.” Pp. 15–23.\n          (2) Petitioners’ allegations that their transfer to Iraqi custody\n  is likely to result in torture are a matter of serious concern but those\n  allegations generally must be addressed by the political branches, not\n  the judiciary. The recognition that it is for the democratically elected\n  branches to assess practices in foreign countries and to determine na-\n  tional policy in light of those assessments is nothing new. As Chief\n  Justice Marshall explained in the Schooner Exchange, “exemptions\n  from territorial jurisdiction . . . must be derived from the consent of\n  the sovereign of the territory” and are “rather questions of policy\n  than of law, . . . they are for diplomatic, rather than legal discussion.”\n  7 Cranch, at 143, 146. In the present cases, the Government explains\n  that it is the policy of the United States not to transfer an individual\n  in circumstances where torture is likely to result and that the State\n  Department has determined that the Justice Ministry—the depart-\n  ment which has authority over Munaf and Omar—as well as its\n  prison and detention facilities, have generally met internationally ac-\n  cepted standards for basic prisoner needs. The judiciary is not suited\n  to second-guess such determinations. Pp. 23–26.\n          (3) Petitioners’ argument that, under Valentine v. United\n  States ex rel. Neidecker, 299 U. S. 5, the Executive lacks discretion to\n  transfer a citizen to Iraqi custody unless “legal authority” to do so “is\n  given by act of Congress or by the terms of a treaty,” id., at 9, is re-\n  jected. Valentine was an extradition case; the present cases involve\n  the transfer to a sovereign’s authority of an individual captured and\n  already detained in that sovereign’s territory. Wilson, supra, also\n  forecloses petitioners’ contention. A Status of Forces Agreement\n  there seemed to give the habeas petitioner a right to trial by an\n  American military tribunal, rather than a Japanese court, 354 U. S.,\n  at 529, but this Court found no “constitutional or statutory” impedi-\n  ment to the Government’s waiver of its jurisdiction in light of Japan’s\n  sovereign interest in prosecuting crimes committed within its bor-\n  ders, id., at 530.

OMAR AND AHMED S. OMAR, AS\n       NEXT FRIENDS OF SHAWQI AHMAD OMAR\n\nON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n                                [June 12, 2008]\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   The Multinational Force–Iraq (MNF–I) is an interna­\ntional coalition force operating in Iraq composed of 26\ndifferent nations, including the United States. The force\noperates under the unified command of United States\nmilitary officers, at the request of the Iraqi Government,\nand in accordance with United Nations (U. N.) Security\nCouncil Resolutions. Pursuant to the U. N. mandate,\nMNF–I forces detain individuals alleged to have commit­\nted hostile or warlike acts in Iraq, pending investigation\nand prosecution in Iraqi courts under Iraqi law.\n   These consolidated cases concern the availability of\n2                     MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhabeas corpus relief arising from the MNF–I’s detention of\nAmerican citizens who voluntarily traveled to Iraq and are\nalleged to have committed crimes there. We are con­\nfronted with two questions. First, do United States courts\nhave jurisdiction over habeas corpus petitions filed on\nbehalf of American citizens challenging their detention in\nIraq by the MNF–I? Second, if such jurisdiction exists,\nmay district courts exercise that jurisdiction to enjoin the\nMNF–I from transferring such individuals to Iraqi custody\nor allowing them to be tried before Iraqi courts?\n  We conclude that the habeas statute extends to Ameri­\ncan citizens held overseas by American forces operating\nsubject to an American chain of command, even when\nthose forces are acting as part of a multinational coalition.\nUnder circumstances such as those presented here, how­\never, habeas corpus provides petitioners with no relief.\n                              I\n  Pursuant to its U. N. mandate, the MNF–I has “ ‘the\nauthority to take all necessary measures to contribute to\nthe maintenance of security and stability in Iraq.’ ” App. G\nto Pet. for Cert. in 07–394, p. 74a, ¶10 (quoting U. N.\nSecurity Council, U. N. Doc. S/Res/1546, ¶10 (June 2004)).\nTo this end, the MNF–I engages in a variety of military\nand humanitarian activities. The multinational force, for\nexample, conducts combat operations against insurgent\nfactions, trains and equips Iraqi security forces, and aids\nin relief and reconstruction efforts.\n  MNF–I forces also detain individuals who pose a threat\nto the security of Iraq. The Government of Iraq retains\nultimate responsibility for the arrest and imprisonment of\nindividuals who violate its laws, but because many of\nIraq’s prison facilities have been destroyed, the MNF–I\nagreed to maintain physical custody of many such indi­\nviduals during Iraqi criminal proceedings. MNF–I forces\nare currently holding approximately 24,000 detainees. An\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAmerican military unit, Task Force 134, oversees deten­\ntion operations and facilities in Iraq, including those\nlocated at Camp Cropper, the detention facility currently\nhousing Shawqi Omar and Mohammad Munaf (herein-\nafter petitioners). The unit is under the command of\nUnited States military officers who report to General\nDavid Petraeus.\n                              A\n   Petitioner Shawqi Omar, an American-Jordanian citi­\nzen, voluntarily traveled to Iraq in 2002. In October 2004,\nOmar was captured and detained in Iraq by U. S. military\nforces operating as part of the MNF–I during a raid of his\nBaghdad home. Omar is believed to have provided aid to\nAbu Musab al-Zarqawi—the late leader of al Qaeda in\nIraq—by facilitating his group’s connection with other\nterrorist groups, bringing foreign fighters into Iraq, and\nplanning and executing kidnappings in Iraq. MNF–I\nsearched his home in an effort to capture and detain in­\nsurgents who were associated with al-Zarqawi. The raid\nnetted an Iraqi insurgent and four Jordanian fighters\nalong with explosive devices and other weapons.\n   The captured insurgents gave sworn statements impli­\ncating Omar in insurgent cell activities. The four Jorda­\nnians testified that they had traveled to Iraq with Omar to\ncommit militant acts against American and other Coali­\ntion Forces. Each of the insurgents stated that, while\nliving in Omar’s home, they had surveilled potential kid­\nnap victims and conducted weapons training. The insur­\ngents explained that Omar’s fluency in English allowed\nhim to lure foreigners to his home in order to kidnap and\nsell them for ransom.\n   Following Omar’s arrest, a three-member MNF–I Tri­\nbunal composed of American military officers concluded\nthat Omar posed a threat to the security of Iraq and des­\nignated him a “security internee.” The tribunal also found\nthat Omar had committed hostile and warlike acts, and\n4                    MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat he was an enemy combatant in the war on terrorism.\nIn accordance with Article 5 of the Geneva Convention,\nOmar was permitted to hear the basis for his deten-\ntion, make a statement, and call immediately available\nwitnesses.\n   In addition to the review of his detention by the MNF–I\nTribunal, Omar received a hearing before the Combined\nReview and Release Board (CRRB)—a nine-member board\ncomposed of six representatives of the Iraqi Government\nand three MNF–I officers. The CRRB, like the MNF–I\nTribunal, concluded that Omar’s continued detention was\nnecessary because he posed a threat to Iraqi security. At\nall times since his capture, Omar has remained in the\ncustody of the United States military operating as part of\nthe MNF–I.\n   Omar’s wife and son filed a next-friend petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus on Omar’s behalf in the District\nCourt for the District of Columbia. Omar v. Harvey, 479\nF. 3d 1, 4 (CADC 2007). After the Department of Justice\ninformed Omar that the MNF–I had decided to refer him\nto the Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI) for criminal\nproceedings, his attorney sought and obtained a prelimi­\nnary injunction barring Omar’s “remov[al] . . . from United\nStates or MNF-I custody.” App. to Pet. in No. 07–394,\nsupra, at 59a. The order directed that\n    “the [United States], their agents, servants, employ­\n    ees, confederates, and any persons acting in concert or\n    participation with them, or having actual or implicit\n    knowledge of this Order . . . shall not remove [Omar]\n    from United States or MNF-I custody, or take any\n    other action inconsistent with this court’s memoran­\n    dum opinion.” Ibid.\n  The United States appealed and the Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed.

S. 197\n(1948) (per curiam), did not preclude review. The Court of\nAppeals distinguished Hirota on the ground that Omar,\nunlike the petitioner in that case, had yet to be convicted\nby a foreign tribunal. 479 F. 3d, at 7–9. The Court of\nAppeals recognized, however, that the writ of habeas\ncorpus could not be used to enjoin release. Id., at 11. It\ntherefore construed the injunction only to bar transfer to\nIraqi custody and upheld the District Court’s order insofar\nas it prohibited the United States from: (1) transferring\nOmar to Iraqi custody, id., at 11–13; (2) sharing details\nconcerning any decision to release Omar with the Iraqi\nGovernment, id., at 13; and (3) presenting Omar to the\nIraqi Courts for investigation and prosecution, id., at 14.\n   Judge Brown dissented. She joined the panel’s jurisdic­\ntional ruling, but would have vacated the injunction be­\ncause, in her view, the District Court had no authority to\nenjoin a transfer that would allow Iraqi officials to take\ncustody of an individual captured in Iraq—something the\nIraqi Government “undeniably h[ad] a right to do.” Id., at\n19. We granted certiorari. 552 U. S. ___ (2007).\n                              B\n  Petitioner Munaf, a citizen of both Iraq and the United\nStates, voluntarily traveled to Iraq with several Romanian\njournalists. He was to serve as the journalists’ translator\nand guide. Shortly after arriving in Iraq, the group\nwas kidnapped and held captive for two months. After\nthe journalists were freed, MNF–I forces detained\nMunaf based on their belief that he had orchestrated the\nkidnappings.\n  A three-judge MNF–I Tribunal conducted a hearing to\ndetermine whether Munaf’s detention was warranted.\nThe MNF–I Tribunal reviewed the facts surrounding\nMunaf’s capture, interviewed witnesses, and considered\n6                    MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe available intelligence information. Munaf was present\nat the hearing and had an opportunity to hear the grounds\nfor his detention, make a statement, and call immediately\navailable witnesses. At the end of the hearing, the tribu­\nnal found that Munaf posed a serious threat to Iraqi secu­\nrity, designated him a “security internee,” and referred\nhis case to the CCCI for criminal investigation and\nprosecution.\n   During his CCCI trial, Munaf admitted on camera and\nin writing that he had facilitated the kidnapping of the\nRomanian journalists. He also appeared as a witness\nagainst his alleged co-conspirators. Later in the proceed­\nings, Munaf recanted his confession, but the CCCI none­\ntheless found him guilty of kidnapping. On appeal, the\nIraqi Court of Cassation vacated Munaf’s conviction and\nremanded his case to the CCCI for further investigation.\nIn re Hikmat, No. 19/Pub. Comm’n/2007, p. 5 (Feb. 19,\n2008). The Court of Cassation directed that Munaf was to\n“remain in custody pending the outcome” of further crimi­\nnal proceedings. Ibid.\n   Meanwhile, Munaf ’s sister filed a next-friend petition\nfor a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia. Mohammed v. Harvey, 456 F. Supp.\n2d 115, 118 (2006). The District Court dismissed the\npetition for lack of jurisdiction, finding that this Court’s\ndecision in Hirota controlled: Munaf was “in the custody of\ncoalition troops operating under the aegis of MNF–I, who\nderive their ultimate authority from the United Nations\nand the MNF-I member nations acting jointly.” 456\nF. Supp. 2d, at 122.\n   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Cir­\ncuit affirmed. 482 F. 3d 582 (2007) (hereinafter Muraf).\nThe Court of Appeals, “[c]onstrained by precedent,” agreed\nwith the District Court that Hirota controlled and dis­\nmissed Munaf’s petition for lack of jurisdiction. 482 F. 3d,\nat 583.

Id., at 585.\nHe concluded that the District Court had improperly\ndismissed for want of jurisdiction because “Munaf is an\nAmerican citizen . . . held by American forces overseas.”\nIbid. Nevertheless, Judge Randolph would have held that\nMunaf’s habeas petition failed on the merits. Id., at 586.\nHe relied on this Court’s holding in Wilson v. Girard, 354\nU. S. 524, 529 (1957), that a “sovereign nation has exclu­\nsive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws com­\nmitted within its borders,” and concluded that the fact\nthat the United States was holding Munaf because of his\nconviction by a foreign tribunal was conclusive. Ibid.1\n  We granted certiorari and consolidated the Omar and\nMunaf cases. 552 U. S. ___ (2007).\n                             II\n  The Solicitor General argues that the federal courts lack\njurisdiction over the detainees’ habeas petitions because\nthe American forces holding Omar and Munaf operate as\npart of a multinational force. Brief for Federal Parties 17–\n36. The habeas statute provides that a federal district\ncourt may entertain a habeas application by a person held\n“in custody under or by color of the authority of the United\nStates,” or “in custody in violation of the Constitution or\nlaws or treaties of the United States.”          28 U. S. C.\n§§2241(c)(1), (3). MNF–I forces, the argument goes, “are\nnot operating solely under United States authority, but\nrather ‘as the agent of’ a multinational force.” Brief for\nFederal Parties 23 (quoting Hirota, supra, at 198). Omar\nand Munaf are thus held pursuant to international au­\n\n——————\n  1 As noted above, Munaf’s conviction was subsequently vacated by an\n\nIraqi appellate court, and he is awaiting a new trial.\n8                         MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthority, not “the authority of the United States,”\n§2241(c)(1), and they are therefore not within the reach of\nthe habeas statute. Brief for Federal Parties 17–18.2\n   The United States acknowledges that Omar and Munaf\nare American citizens held overseas in the immediate\n“ ‘physical custody’ ” of American soldiers who answer only\nto an American chain of command. Id., at 21. The MNF–I\nitself operates subject to a unified American command.\nId., at 23. “[A]s a practical matter,” the Government\nconcedes, it is “the President and the Pentagon, the Secre­\ntary of Defense, and the American commanders that con­\ntrol what . . . American soldiers do,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 15,\nincluding the soldiers holding Munaf and Omar. In light\nof these admissions, it is unsurprising that the United\nStates has never argued that it lacks the authority to\nrelease Munaf or Omar, or that it requires the consent of\nother countries to do so.\n   We think these concessions the end of the jurisdictional\ninquiry. The Government’s argument—that the federal\ncourts have no jurisdiction over American citizens held by\nAmerican forces operating as multinational agents—is not\neasily reconciled with the text of §2241(c)(1). See Duncan\nv. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 172 (2001) (“We begin, as always,\nwith the language of the statute”). That section applies to\npersons held “in custody under or by color of the authority\nof the United States.” §2241(c)(1). An individual is held\n“in custody” by the United States when the United States\nofficial charged with his detention has “the power to pro­\nduce” him. Wales v. Whitney, 114 U. S. 564, 574 (1885);\nsee also §2243 (“The writ . . . shall be directed to the per­\nson having custody of the person detained”). The disjunc­\ntive “or” in §2241(c)(1) makes clear that actual custody by\n——————\n  2 These cases concern only American citizens and only the statutory\n\nreach of the writ. Nothing herein addresses jurisdiction with respect to\nalien petitioners or with respect to the constitutional scope of the writ.\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe United States suffices for jurisdiction, even if that\ncustody could be viewed as “under . . . color of” another\nauthority, such as the MNF–I.\n   The Government’s primary contention is that the Dis­\ntrict Courts lack jurisdiction in these cases because of this\nCourt’s decision in Hirota. That slip of a case cannot bear\nthe weight the Government would place on it. In Hirota,\nJapanese citizens sought permission to file habeas corpus\napplications directly in this Court. The petitioners were\nnoncitizens detained in Japan. They had been convicted\nand sentenced by the International Military Tribunal for\nthe Far East—an international tribunal established by\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur acting, as the Court put it, in\nhis capacity as “the agent of the Allied Powers.” 338 U. S.,\nat 198. Although those familiar with the history of the\nperiod would appreciate the possibility of confusion over\nwho General MacArthur took orders from, the Court con­\ncluded that the sentencing tribunal was “not a tribunal of\nthe United States.” Ibid. The Court then held that,\n“[u]nder the foregoing circumstances,” United States\ncourts had “no power or authority to review, to affirm, set\naside or annul the judgments and sentences” imposed by\nthat tribunal. Ibid. Accordingly, the Court denied peti­\ntioners leave to file their habeas corpus applications,\nwithout further legal analysis. Ibid.\n   The Government argues that the multinational charac­\nter of the MNF–I, like the multinational character of the\ntribunal at issue in Hirota, means that it too is not a\nUnited States entity subject to habeas. Reply Brief for\nFederal Parties 5–7. In making this claim, the Govern­\nment acknowledges that the MNF–I is subject to American\nauthority, but contends that the same was true of the\ntribunal at issue in Hirota. In Hirota, the Government\nnotes, the petitioners were held by the United States\nEighth Army, which took orders from General MacArthur,\n338 U. S., at 199 (Douglas, J., concurring), and were sub­\n10                    MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nject to an “unbroken” chain of U. S. command, ending with\nthe President of the United States, id., at 207.\n   The Court in Hirota, however, may have found it signifi­\ncant, in considering the nature of the tribunal established\nby General MacArthur, that the Solicitor General ex­\npressly contended that General MacArthur, as pertinent,\nwas not subject to United States authority. The facts\nsuggesting that the tribunal in Hirota was subject to an\n“unbroken” United States chain of command were not\namong the “foregoing circumstances” cited in the per\ncuriam opinion disposing of the case, id., at 198. They\nwere highlighted only in Justice Douglas’s belated opinion\nconcurring in the result, published five months after that\nper curiam. Id., at 199, n.*. Indeed, arguing before this\nCourt, Solicitor General Perlman stated that General\nMacArthur did not serve “under the Joint Chiefs of Staff,”\nthat his duty was “to obey the directives of the Far East­\nern Commission and not our War Department,” and that\n“no process that could be issued from this court . . . would\nhave any effect on his action.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in Hirota v.\nMacArthur, O. T. 1948, No. 239, pp. 42, 50, 51. Here, in\ncontrast, the Government acknowledges that our military\ncommanders do answer to the President.\n   Even if the Government is correct that the international\nauthority at issue in Hirota is no different from the inter­\nnational authority at issue here, the present “circum­\nstances” differ in another respect. These cases concern\nAmerican citizens while Hirota did not, and the Court has\nindicated that habeas jurisdiction can depend on citizen­\nship. See Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, 781\n(1950); Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466, 486 (2004)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). See also Munaf,\n482 F. 3d, at 584 (“[W]e do not mean to suggest that we\nfind the logic of Hirota especially clear or compelling,\nparticularly as applied to American citizens”); id., at 585\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(Randolph, J., concurring in judgment).3 “Under the fore­\ngoing circumstances,” we decline to extend our holding in\nHirota to preclude American citizens held overseas by\nAmerican soldiers subject to a United States chain of\ncommand from filing habeas petitions.\n                            III\n   We now turn to the question whether United States\ndistrict courts may exercise their habeas jurisdiction to\nenjoin our Armed Forces from transferring individuals\ndetained within another sovereign’s territory to that sov­\nereign’s government for criminal prosecution. The nature\nof that question requires us to proceed “with the circum­\nspection appropriate when this Court is adjudicating\nissues inevitably entangled in the conduct of our interna­\ntional relations.” Romero v. International Terminal Oper­\nating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 383 (1959). Here there is the\nfurther consideration that those issues arise in the context\nof ongoing military operations conducted by American\nForces overseas. We therefore approach these questions\ncognizant that “courts traditionally have been reluctant to\nintrude upon the authority of the Executive in military\nand national security affairs.” Department of Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.

The peti­\n\ntioners in that case sought an original writ, filing their motions for\nleave to file habeas petitions “in this Court.” 338 U. S., at 198. There\nis, however, some authority for the proposition that this Court has\noriginal subject-matter jurisdiction only over “ ‘cases affecting ambas­\nsadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state\nshall be a party,’ ” Marbury v.

GEREN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(1) effectuating “Omar’s transfer in any form, whether by\nan official handoff or otherwise,” to Iraqi custody, 479\nF. 3d, at 12; (2) sharing details concerning any decision to\nrelease Omar with the Iraqi Government, id., at 13; and\n(3) “presenting Omar to the [Iraqi courts] for trial,” id., at\n14. This is not a narrow injunction. Even the habeas\npetitioners do not defend it in its entirety. They acknowl­\nedge the authority of the Iraqi courts to begin criminal\nproceedings against Omar and wisely concede that any\ninjunction “clearly need not include a bar on ‘information-\nsharing.’ ” Brief for Habeas Petitioners 61. As Judge\nBrown noted in her dissent, such a bar would impermissi­\nbly “enjoin the United States military from sharing infor­\nmation with an allied foreign sovereign in a war zone.”\nOmar, supra, at 18.\n   We begin with the basics. A preliminary injunction is\nan “extraordinary and drastic remedy,” 11A C. Wright, A.\nMiller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2948,\np. 129 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter Wright & Miller) (foot­\nnotes omitted); it is never awarded as of right, Yakus v.\nUnited States, 321 U. S. 414, 440 (1944). Rather, a party\nseeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate,\namong other things, “a likelihood of success on the merits.”\nGonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vege­\ntal, 546 U. S. 418, 428 (2006) (citing Mazurek v. Arm­\nstrong, 520 U. S. 968, 972 (1997) (per curiam); Doran v.\nSalem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S. 922, 931 (1975)). But one\nsearches the opinions below in vain for any mention of a\nlikelihood of success as to the merits of Omar’s habeas\npetition. Instead, the District Court concluded that the\n“jurisdictional issues” presented questions “so serious,\nsubstantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them fair\nground for litigation and thus for more deliberative inves­\ntigation.” Omar v. Harvey, 416 F. Supp. 2d 19, 23–24, 27\n(DC 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis\nadded).\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    The D. C. Circuit made the same mistake. In that\ncourt’s view, the “only question before [it] at th[at] stage of\nthe litigation relate[d] to the district court’s jurisdiction.”\n479 F. 3d, at 11. As a result, the Court of Appeals held\nthat it “need not address” the merits of Omar’s habeas\nclaims: those merits had “no relevance.” Ibid.\n    A difficult question as to jurisdiction is, of course, no\nreason to grant a preliminary injunction. It says nothing\nabout the “likelihood of success on the merits,” other than\nmaking such success more unlikely due to potential im­\npediments to even reaching the merits. Indeed, if all a\n“likelihood of success on the merits” meant was that the\ndistrict court likely had jurisdiction, then preliminary\ninjunctions would be the rule, not the exception. In light\nof these basic principles, we hold that it was an abuse of\ndiscretion for the District Court to grant a preliminary\ninjunction on the view that the “jurisdictional issues” in\nOmar’s case were tough, without even considering the\nmerits of the underlying habeas petition.\n    What we have said thus far would require reversal and\nremand in each of these cases: The lower courts in Munaf\nerred in dismissing for want of jurisdiction, and the lower\ncourts in Omar erred in issuing and upholding the pre­\nliminary injunction. There are occasions, however, when\nit is appropriate to proceed further and address the mer­\nits. This is one of them.\n    Our authority to address the merits of the habeas peti­\ntioners’ claims is clear. Review of a preliminary injunction\n“is not confined to the act of granting the injunctio[n], but\nextends as well to determining whether there is any insu­\nperable objection, in point of jurisdiction or merits, to the\nmaintenance of [the] bill, and, if so, to directing a final\ndecree dismissing it.” City and County of Denver v. New\nYork Trust Co., 229 U. S. 123, 136 (1913). See also Deckert\nv. Independence Shares Corp., 311 U. S. 282, 287 (1940)\n(“ ‘If insuperable objection to maintaining the bill clearly\n14                    MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nappears, it may be dismissed and the litigation termi­\nnated’ ” (quoting Meccano, Ltd. v. John Wanamaker, N. Y.,\n253 U. S. 136, 141 (1920))). This has long been the rule:\n“By the ordinary practice in equity as administered in\nEngland and this country,” a reviewing court has the\npower on appeal from an interlocutory order “to examine\nthe merits of the case . . . and upon deciding them in favor\nof the defendant to dismiss the bill.” North Carolina R.\nCo. v. Story, 268 U. S. 288, 292 (1925). Indeed, “[t]he\nquestion whether an action should be dismissed for failure\nto state a claim is one of the most common issues that may\nbe reviewed on appeal from an interlocutory injunction\norder.” 16 Wright & Miller, Jurisdiction and Related\nMatters, §3921.1, at 32 (2d ed. 1996).\n   Adjudication of the merits is most appropriate if the\ninjunction rests on a question of law and it is plain that\nthe plaintiff cannot prevail. In such cases, the defendant\nis entitled to judgment. See, e.g., Deckert, supra, at 287;\nNorth Carolina R. Co., supra, at 292; City and County of\nDenver, supra, at 136.\n   Given that the present cases involve habeas petitions\nthat implicate sensitive foreign policy issues in the context\nof ongoing military operations, reaching the merits is the\nwisest course. See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Saw­\nyer, 343 U. S. 579, 584–585 (1952) (finding the case ripe\nfor merits review on appeal from stay of preliminary in­\njunction). For the reasons we explain below, the relief\nsought by the habeas petitioners makes clear under our\nprecedents that the power of the writ ought not to be\nexercised. Because the Government is entitled to judg­\nment as a matter of law, it is appropriate for us to termi­\nnate the litigation now.\n                          IV\n  The habeas petitioners argue that the writ should be\ngranted in their cases because they have “a legally en­\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nforceable right” not to be transferred to Iraqi authority for\ncriminal proceedings under both the Due Process Clause\nand the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of\n1998 (FARR Act), div. G, 112 Stat. 2681–761, and because\nthey are innocent civilians who have been unlawfully\ndetained by the United States in violation of the Due\nProcess Clause. Brief for Habeas Petitioners 48–52. With\nrespect to the transfer claim, petitioners request an in­\njunction prohibiting the United States from transferring\nthem to Iraqi custody. With respect to the unlawful deten­\ntion claim, petitioners seek “release”—but only to the\nextent that release would not result in “unlawful” transfer\nto Iraqi custody. Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Both of these re­\nquests would interfere with Iraq’s sovereign right to “pun­\nish offenses against its laws committed within its bor­\nders.” Wilson, 354 U. S., at 529. We accordingly hold that\nthe detainees’ claims do not state grounds upon which\nhabeas relief may be granted, that the habeas petitions\nshould have been promptly dismissed, and that no injunc­\ntion should have been entered.\n                             A\n   Habeas corpus is “governed by equitable principles.” Fay\nv. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438 (1963). We have therefore\nrecognized that “prudential concerns,” Withrow v. Wil­\nliams, 507 U. S. 680, 686 (1993), such as comity and the\norderly administration of criminal justice, may “require a\nfederal court to forgo the exercise of its habeas corpus\npower,” Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536, 539 (1976).\n   The principle that a habeas court is “not bound in every\ncase” to issue the writ, Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 251\n(1886), follows from the precatory language of the habeas\nstatute, and from its common-law origins. The habeas\nstatute provides only that a writ of habeas corpus “may be\ngranted,” §2241(a) (emphasis added), and directs federal\ncourts to “dispose of [habeas petitions] as law and justice\n16                   MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequire,” §2243. See Danforth v. Minnesota, 552 U. S. ___,\n___ (2008) (slip op., at 13–14). Likewise, the writ did not\nissue in England “as of mere course,” but rather required\nthe petitioner to demonstrate why the “extraordinary\npower of the crown” should be exercised, 3 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries on the Laws of England 132 (1768); even\nthen, courts were directed to “do as to justice shall apper­\ntain,” 1 id., at 131 (1765). The question, therefore, even\nwhere a habeas court has the power to issue the writ, is\n“whether this be a case in which [that power] ought to be\nexercised.” Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 201 (1830) (Mar­\nshall, C. J.).\n   At the outset, the nature of the relief sought by the\nhabeas petitioners suggests that habeas is not appropriate\nin these cases. Habeas is at its core a remedy for unlawful\nexecutive detention. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507,\n536 (2004) (plurality opinion). The typical remedy for\nsuch detention is, of course, release. See, e.g., Preiser v.\nRodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 484 (1973) (“[T]he traditional\nfunction of the writ is to secure release from illegal cus­\ntody”). But here the last thing petitioners want is simple\nrelease; that would expose them to apprehension by Iraqi\nauthorities for criminal prosecution—precisely what peti­\ntioners went to federal court to avoid. At the end of the\nday, what petitioners are really after is a court order\nrequiring the United States to shelter them from the\nsovereign government seeking to have them answer for\nalleged crimes committed within that sovereign’s borders.\n   The habeas petitioners do not dispute that they volun­\ntarily traveled to Iraq, that they remain detained within\nthe sovereign territory of Iraq today, or that they are\nalleged to have committed serious crimes in Iraq. Indeed,\nOmar and Munaf both concede that, if they were not in\nMNF–I custody, Iraq would be free to arrest and prosecute\nthem under Iraqi law. See Tr. in Omar, No. 06–5126\n(CADC), pp. 48–49, 59 (Sept. 11, 2006); Tr. in Mohammed,\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNo. 06–1455 (DC), pp. 15–16 (Oct. 10, 2006).       There is,\nmoreover, no question that Munaf is the subject of ongoing\nIraqi criminal proceedings and that Omar would be but for\nthe present injunction. Munaf was convicted by the CCCI,\nand while that conviction was overturned on appeal, his\ncase was remanded to and is again pending before the\nCCCI. The MNF–I referred Omar to the CCCI for prose­\ncution at which point he sought and obtained an injunc­\ntion that prohibits his prosecution. See 479 F. 3d, at 16,\nn. 3 (Brown, J., dissenting in part) (“ ‘[Omar] has not yet\nhad a trial or even an investigative hearing in the CCCI\ndue to the district court’s unprecedented injunction’ ”\n(citing Opposition to Petitioner’s Emergency Motion for\nInjunctive Relief 18–19, in Munaf v. Harvey, No. 06–5324\n(CADC, Oct. 25, 2006))).\n   Given these facts, our cases make clear that Iraq has a\nsovereign right to prosecute Omar and Munaf for crimes\ncommitted on its soil. As Chief Justice Marshall explained\nnearly two centuries ago, “[t]he jurisdiction of the nation\nwithin its own territory is necessarily exclusive and abso­\nlute.” Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116,\n136 (1812). See Wilson, supra, at 529 (“A sovereign nation\nhas exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its\nlaws committed within its borders, unless it expressly or\nimpliedly consents to surrender its jurisdiction”); Reid v.\nCovert, 354 U. S. 1, 15, n. 29 (1957) (opinion of Black, J.)\n(“[A] foreign nation has plenary criminal jurisdiction . . .\nover all Americans . . . who commit offenses against its\nlaws within its territory”); Kinsella v. Krueger, 351 U. S.\n470, 479 (1956) (nations have a “sovereign right to try and\npunish [American citizens] for offenses committed within\ntheir borders,” unless they “have relinquished [their]\njurisdiction” to do so).\n   This is true with respect to American citizens who travel\nabroad and commit crimes in another nation whether or\nnot the pertinent criminal process comes with all the\n18                   MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrights guaranteed by our Constitution. “When an Ameri­\ncan citizen commits a crime in a foreign country he cannot\ncomplain if required to submit to such modes of trial and\nto such punishment as the laws of that country may pre­\nscribe for its own people.” Neely v. Henkel, 180 U. S. 109,\n123 (1901).\n   The habeas petitioners nonetheless argue that the Due\nProcess Clause includes a “[f]reedom from unlawful trans­\nfer” that is “protected wherever the government seizes a\ncitizen.” Brief for Habeas Petitioners 48. We disagree.\nNot only have we long recognized the principle that a\nnation state reigns sovereign within its own territory, we\nhave twice applied that principle to reject claims that the\nConstitution precludes the Executive from transferring a\nprisoner to a foreign country for prosecution in an alleg­\nedly unconstitutional trial.\n   In Wilson, 354 U. S. 524, we reversed an injunction\nsimilar to the one at issue here. During a cavalry exercise\nat the Camp Weir range in Japan, Girard, a Specialist\nThird Class in the United States Army, caused the death\nof a Japanese woman. Id., at 525–526. After Japan in­\ndicted Girard, but while he was still in United States\ncustody, Girard filed a writ of habeas corpus in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Columbia. Ibid.\nThe District Court granted a preliminary injunction\nagainst the United States, enjoining the “proposed deliv­\nery of [Girard] to the Japanese Government.” Girard v.\nWilson, 152 F. Supp. 21, 27 (DC 1957). In the District\nCourt’s view, to permit the transfer to Japanese authority\nwould violate the rights guaranteed to Girard by the\nConstitution. Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari, and vacated the injunction. 354\nU. S., at 529–530. We noted that Japan had exclusive\njurisdiction “to punish offenses against its laws committed\nwithin its borders,” unless it had surrendered that juris­\ndiction. Id., at 529. Consequently, even though Japan\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhad ceded some of its jurisdiction to the United States\npursuant to a bilateral Status of Forces Agreement, the\nUnited States could waive that jurisdiction—as it had\ndone in Girard’s case—and the habeas court was without\nauthority to enjoin Girard’s transfer to the Japanese\nauthorities. Id., at 529–530.\n   Likewise, in Neely v. Henkel, supra, this Court held that\nhabeas corpus was not available to defeat the criminal\njurisdiction of a foreign sovereign, even when application\nof that sovereign’s law would allegedly violate the Consti­\ntution. Neely—the habeas petitioner and an American\ncitizen—was accused of violating Cuban law in Cuba. Id.,\nat 112–113. He was arrested and detained in the United\nStates. Id., at 113. The United States indicated its intent\nto extradite him, and Neely filed suit seeking to block his\nextradition on the grounds that Cuban law did not provide\nthe panoply of rights guaranteed him by the Constitution\nof the United States. Id., at 122. We summarily rejected\nthis claim: “The answer to this suggestion is that those\n[constitutional] provisions have no relation to crimes\ncommitted without the jurisdiction of the United States\nagainst the laws of a foreign country.” Ibid. Neely alleged\nno claim for which a “discharge on habeas corpus” could\nissue. Id., at 125. Accordingly, the United States was free\nto transfer him to Cuban custody for prosecution.\n   In the present cases, the habeas petitioners concede that\nIraq has the sovereign authority to prosecute them for\nalleged violations of its law, yet nonetheless request an\ninjunction prohibiting the United States from transferring\nthem to Iraqi custody. But as the foregoing cases make\nclear, habeas is not a means of compelling the United\nStates to harbor fugitives from the criminal justice system\nof a sovereign with undoubted authority to prosecute\nthem.\n   Petitioners’ “release” claim adds nothing to their “trans­\nfer” claim. That claim fails for the same reasons the\n20                    MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntransfer claim fails, given that the release petitioners seek\nis release in a form that would avoid transfer. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 47–48; App. 40 (coupling Munaf’s claim for\nrelease with a request for order requiring the United\nStates to bring him to a U. S. court); App. 123 (same with\nrespect to Omar). Such “release” would impermissibly\ninterfere with Iraq’s “exclusive jurisdiction to punish\noffenses against its laws committed within its borders,”\nWilson, supra, at 529; the “release” petitioners seek is\nnothing less than an order commanding our forces to\nsmuggle them out of Iraq. Indeed, the Court of Appeals in\nOmar’s case took the extraordinary step of upholding an\ninjunction that prohibited the Executive from releasing\nOmar—the quintessential habeas remedy—if the United\nStates shared information about his release with its mili­\ntary ally, Iraq. 479 F. 3d, at 13. Habeas does not require\nthe United States to keep an unsuspecting nation in the\ndark when it releases an alleged criminal insurgent within\nits borders.\n   Moreover, because Omar and Munaf are being held by\nUnited States Armed Forces at the behest of the Iraqi\nGovernment pending their prosecution in Iraqi courts,\nMohammed, 456 F. Supp. 2d, at 117, release of any kind\nwould interfere with the sovereign authority of Iraq “to\npunish offenses against its laws committed within its\nborders,” Wilson, supra, at 529. This point becomes clear\ngiven that the MNF–I, pursuant to its U. N. mandate, is\nauthorized to “take all necessary measures to contribute to\nthe maintenance of security and stability in Iraq,” App. G\nto Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–394, p. 74a, ¶10, and specifically\nto provide for the “internment [of individuals in Iraq]\nwhere this is necessary for imperative reasons of security,”\nid., at 86a.\n   While the Iraqi Government is ultimately “responsible\nfor [the] arrest, detention and imprisonment” of individu­\nals who violate its laws, S. C. Res. 1790, Annex I, ¶4, p. 6,\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. N. Doc. S/RES/1790 (Dec. 18, 2007), the MNF–I main­\ntains physical custody of individuals like Munaf and Omar\nwhile their cases are being heard by the CCCI, Moham­\nmed, supra, at 117. Indeed, Munaf is currently held at\nCamp Cropper pursuant to the express order of the Iraqi\nCourts. See In re Hikmat, No. 19/Pub. Comm’n/2007, at 5\n(directing that Munaf “remain in custody pending the\noutcome” of further Iraqi proceedings). As that court order\nmakes clear, MNF–I detention is an integral part of the\nIraqi system of criminal justice. MNF–I forces augment\nthe Iraqi Government’s peacekeeping efforts by function­\ning, in essence, as its jailor. Any requirement that the\nMNF–I release a detainee would, in effect, impose a re­\nlease order on the Iraqi Government.\n   The habeas petitioners acknowledge that some interfer­\nence with a foreign criminal system is too much. They\nconcede that “it is axiomatic that an American court does\nnot provide collateral review of proceedings in a foreign\ntribunal.” Brief for Habeas Petitioners 39 (citing Republic\nof Austria v. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677, 700 (2004)). We\nagree, but see no reason why habeas corpus should permit\na prisoner detained within a foreign sovereign’s territory\nto prevent a trial from going forward in the first place. It\ndid not matter that the habeas petitioners in Wilson and\nNeely had not been convicted. 354 U. S., at 525–526; 180\nU. S., at 112–113. Rather, “the same principles of comity\nand respect for foreign sovereigns that preclude judicial\nscrutiny of foreign convictions necessarily render invalid\nattempts to shield citizens from foreign prosecution in\norder to preempt such nonreviewable adjudications.”\nOmar, 479 F. 3d, at 17 (Brown, J., dissenting in part).\n   To allow United States courts to intervene in an ongoing\nforeign criminal proceeding and pass judgment on its\nlegitimacy seems at least as great an intrusion as the\nplainly barred collateral review of foreign convictions. See\nBanco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 417–\n22                        MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n418 (1964) (“ ‘To permit the validity of the acts of one\nsovereign State to be reexamined and perhaps condemned\nby the courts of another would very certainly “imperil the\namicable relations between governments and vex the\npeace of nations” ’ ” (quoting Oetjen v. Central Leather Co.,\n246 U. S. 297, 303–304 (1918); punctuation omitted)).4\n   There is of course even more at issue here: Neither\nNeely nor Wilson concerned individuals captured and\ndetained within an ally’s territory during ongoing hostili­\nties involving our troops. Neely involved a charge of em­\nbezzlement; Wilson the peacetime actions of a serviceman.\nYet in those cases we held that the Constitution allows the\nExecutive to transfer American citizens to foreign authori­\nties for criminal prosecution. It would be passing strange\nto hold that the Executive lacks that same authority\nwhere, as here, the detainees were captured by our Armed\nForces for engaging in serious hostile acts against an ally\nin what the Government refers to as “an active theater of\ncombat.” Brief for Federal Parties 16.\n   Such a conclusion would implicate not only concerns\nabout interfering with a sovereign’s recognized prerogative\nto apply its criminal law to those alleged to have commit­\nted crimes within its borders, but also concerns about\nunwarranted judicial intrusion into the Executive’s ability\nto conduct military operations abroad. Our constitutional\nframework “requires that the judiciary be as scrupulous\nnot to interfere with legitimate Army matters as the Army\n——————\n   4 The habeas petitioners claim that the injunction only bars Omar’s\n\npresentation to the Iraqi courts and that the CCCI trial can go forward\nin Omar’s absence. The injunction is not so easily narrowed. It was\nentered on the theory that Omar might be “presented to the CCCI and\nin that same day, be tried, [and] convicted,” thus depriving the United\nStates district courts of jurisdiction. Omar v. Harvey, 416 F. Supp. 2d\n19, 29 (DC 2006). Petitioners’ interpretation makes no sense under\nthat theory: If a conviction would deprive the habeas court of jurisdic­\ntion, a trial, with or without the defendant, could result in just such a\njurisdiction-divesting order.\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            23\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmust be scrupulous not to intervene in judicial matters.”\nOrloff v. Willoughby, 345 U. S. 83, 94 (1953). Those who\ncommit crimes within a sovereign’s territory may be trans­\nferred to that sovereign’s government for prosecution;\nthere is hardly an exception to that rule when the crime at\nissue is not embezzlement but unlawful insurgency di­\nrected against an ally during ongoing hostilities involving\nour troops.\n                                B\n                                1\n   Petitioners contend that these general principles are\ntrumped in their cases because their transfer to Iraqi\ncustody is likely to result in torture. This allegation was\nraised in Munaf’s petition for habeas, App. 39, ¶46, but\nnot in Omar’s. Such allegations are of course a matter of\nserious concern, but in the present context that concern is\nto be addressed by the political branches, not the judici­\nary. See M. Bassiouni, International Extradition: United\nStates Law and Practice 921 (2007) (“Habeas corpus has\nbeen held not to be a valid means of inquiry into the\ntreatment the relator is anticipated to receive in the re­\nquesting state”).\n   This conclusion is reflected in the cases already cited.\nEven with respect to claims that detainees would be de­\nnied constitutional rights if transferred, we have recog­\nnized that it is for the political branches, not the judiciary,\nto assess practices in foreign countries and to determine\nnational policy in light of those assessments. Thus, the\nCourt in Neely concluded that an American citizen who\n“commits a crime in a foreign country” “cannot complain if\nrequired to submit to such modes of trial and to such\npunishment as the laws of that country may prescribe for\nits own people,” but went on to explain that this was true\n“unless a different mode be provided for by treaty stipula­\ntion between that country and the United States.” 180\n24                        MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 123. Diplomacy was the means of addressing the\npetitioner’s concerns.\n  By the same token, while the Court in Wilson stated the\ngeneral principle that a “sovereign nation has exclusive\njurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed\nwithin its borders,” it recognized that this rule could be\naltered by diplomatic agreement in light of particular\nconcerns—as it was in that case—and by a decision of the\nExecutive to waive jurisdiction granted under that agree­\nment—as it was in that case. 354 U. S., at 529. See also\nKinsella, 351 U. S., at 479 (alteration of jurisdictional rule\nthrough “carefully drawn agreements”). This recognition\nthat it is the political branches that bear responsibility for\ncreating exceptions to the general rule is nothing new; as\nChief Justice Marshall explained in the Schooner Ex­\nchange, “exemptions from territorial jurisdiction . . . must\nbe derived from the consent of the sovereign of the terri­\ntory” and are “rather questions of policy than of law, that\nthey are for diplomatic, rather than legal discussion.” 7\nCranch, at 143, 146. The present concerns are of the same\nnature as the loss of constitutional rights alleged in Wil­\nson and Neely, and are governed by the same principles.5\n  The Executive Branch may, of course, decline to surren­\nder a detainee for many reasons, including humanitarian\nones. Petitioners here allege only the possibility of mis­\ntreatment in a prison facility; this is not a more extreme\ncase in which the Executive has determined that a de­\ntainee is likely to be tortured but decides to transfer him\n——————\n  5 The  United States has in fact entered into treaties that provide\nprocedural protections to American citizens tried in other nations. See,\ne.g., North Atlantic Treaty: Status of Forces, June 19, 1951, 4 U. S. T.\n1802, T. I. A. S. No. 2846, Art. VII, ¶9 (guaranteeing arrested members\nof the Armed Forces and their civilian dependents, inter alia, an\nattorney, an interpreter, and a prompt and speedy trial, as well as the\nright to confront witnesses, obtain favorable witnesses, and communi­\ncate with a representative of the United States).\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)             25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nanyway. Indeed, the Solicitor General states that it is the\npolicy of the United States not to transfer an individual in\ncircumstances where torture is likely to result. Brief for\nFederal Parties 47; Reply Brief for Federal Parties 23. In\nthese cases the United States explains that, although it\nremains concerned about torture among some sectors of\nthe Iraqi Government, the State Department has deter­\nmined that the Justice Ministry—the department that\nwould have authority over Munaf and Omar—as well as\nits prison and detention facilities have “ ‘generally met\ninternationally accepted standards for basic prisoner\nneeds.’ ” Ibid. The Solicitor General explains that such\ndeterminations are based on “the Executive’s assessment\nof the foreign country’s legal system and . . . the Execu­\ntive[’s] . . . ability to obtain foreign assurances it considers\nreliable.” Brief for Federal Parties 47.\n   The Judiciary is not suited to second-guess such deter­\nminations—determinations that would require federal\ncourts to pass judgment on foreign justice systems and\nundermine the Government’s ability to speak with one\nvoice in this area. See The Federalist No. 42, p. 279 (J.\nCooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (“If we are to be one nation in\nany respect, it clearly ought to be in respect to other na­\ntions”). In contrast, the political branches are well situ­\nated to consider sensitive foreign policy issues, such as\nwhether there is a serious prospect of torture at the hands\nof an ally, and what to do about it if there is. As Judge\nBrown noted, “we need not assume the political branches\nare oblivious to these concerns.            Indeed, the other\nbranches possess significant diplomatic tools and leverage\nthe judiciary lacks.” 479 F. 3d, at 20, n. 6 (dissenting\nopinion).\n   Petitioners briefly argue that their claims of potential\ntorture may not be readily dismissed on the basis of these\nprinciples because the FARR Act prohibits transfer when\ntorture may result. Brief for Habeas Petitioners 51–52.\n26                         MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nNeither petitioner asserted a FARR Act claim in his peti­\ntion for habeas, and the Act was not raised in any of the\ncertiorari filings before this Court. Even in their merits\nbrief in this Court, the habeas petitioners hardly discuss\nthe issue. Id., at 17, 51–52, 57–58. The Government\ntreats the issue in kind. Reply Brief for Federal Parties\n24–26. Under such circumstances we will not consider the\nquestion.6\n                             2\n  Finally, the habeas petitioners raise the additional\nargument that the United States may not transfer a de­\ntainee to Iraqi custody, not because it would be unconsti­\n——————\n   6 We hold that these habeas petitions raise no claim for relief under\n\nthe FARR Act and express no opinion on whether Munaf and Omar\nmay be permitted to amend their respective pleadings to raise such a\nclaim on remand. Even if considered on the merits, several issues\nunder the FARR Act claim would have to be addressed. First, the Act\nspeaks to situations where a detainee is being “returned” to “a country.”\nFARR Act §2242(a), 112 Stat. 2681–822 (“It shall be the policy of the\nUnited States not to expel, extradite, or otherwise effect the involun­\ntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial\ngrounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected\nto torture, regardless of whether the person is physically present in the\nUnited States”); see also Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 1465 U. N. T. S. 85,\nArt. 3, S. Treaty Doc. No. 20, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 6 (1988) (“No\nState Party shall expel, return (‘refouler’) or extradite a person to\nanother State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he\nwould be in danger of being subjected to torture” (emphasis added)). It\nis not settled that the Act addresses the transfer of an individual\nlocated in Iraq to the Government of Iraq; arguably such an individual\nis not being “returned” to “a country”—he is already there.\n   Second, claims under the FARR Act may be limited to certain immi­\ngration proceedings. See §2242(d), 112 Stat. 2681–822 (“[N]othing in\nthis section shall be construed as providing any court jurisdiction to\nconsider or review claims raised under the Convention or this section,\nor any other determination made with respect to the application of the\npolicy set forth in [this section], except as part of the review of a final\norder of removal pursuant to [8 U. S. C. §1252 (2000 ed. and Supp. V]”).\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntutional to do so, but because the “[G]overnment may not\ntransfer a citizen without legal authority.” Brief for Ha­\nbeas Petitioners 54. The United States, they claim, bears\nthe burden of “identify[ing] a treaty or statute that per­\nmits it to transfer the[m] to Iraqi custody.” Id., at 49.\n   The habeas petitioners rely prominently on Valentine v.\nUnited States ex rel. Neidecker, 299 U. S. 5 (1936), where\nwe ruled that the Executive may not extradite a person\nheld within the United States unless “legal authority” to\ndo so “is given by act of Congress or by the terms of a\ntreaty,” id., at 9. But Valentine is readily distinguishable.\nIt involved the extradition of an individual from the\nUnited States; this is not an extradition case, but one\ninvolving the transfer to a sovereign’s authority of an\nindividual captured and already detained in that sover­\neign’s territory. In the extradition context, when a “fugi­\ntive criminal” is found within the United States, “ ‘there is\nno authority vested in any department of the government\nto seize [him] and surrender him to a foreign power,’ ” in\nthe absence of a pertinent constitutional or legislative\nprovision. Ibid. But Omar and Munaf voluntarily trav­\neled to Iraq and are being held there. They are therefore\nsubject to the territorial jurisdiction of that sovereign, not\nof the United States. Moreover, as we have explained, the\npetitioners are being held by the United States, acting as\npart of MNF–I, at the request of and on behalf of the Iraqi\nGovernment. It would be more than odd if the Govern­\nment had no authority to transfer them to the very sover­\neign on whose behalf, and within whose territory, they are\nbeing detained.\n   The habeas petitioners further contend that this Court’s\ndecision in Wilson supports their argument that the Ex­\necutive lacks the discretion to transfer a citizen absent a\ntreaty or statute. Brief for Habeas Petitioners 54–55.\nQuite the opposite. Wilson forecloses it. The only “author­\nity” at issue in Wilson—a Status of Forces Agreement—\n28                   MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nseemed to give the habeas petitioner in that case a right to\nbe tried by an American military tribunal, not a Japanese\ncourt. 354 U. S., at 529. Nevertheless, in light of the\nbackground principle that Japan had a sovereign interest\nin prosecuting crimes committed within its borders, this\nCourt found no “constitutional or statutory” impediment to\nthe United States’s waiver of its jurisdiction under the\nagreement. Id., at 530.\n                        *    *    *\n  Munaf and Omar are alleged to have committed hostile\nand warlike acts within the sovereign territory of Iraq\nduring ongoing hostilities there. Pending their criminal\nprosecution for those offenses, Munaf and Omar are being\nheld in Iraq by American forces operating pursuant to a\nU. N. Mandate and at the request of the Iraqi Govern­\nment. Petitioners concede that Iraq has a sovereign right\nto prosecute them for alleged violations of its law. Yet\nthey went to federal court seeking an order that would\nallow them to defeat precisely that sovereign authority.\nHabeas corpus does not require the United States to shel­\nter such fugitives from the criminal justice system of the\nsovereign with authority to prosecute them.\n  For all the reasons given above, petitioners state no\nclaim in their habeas petitions for which relief can be\ngranted, and those petitions should have been promptly\ndismissed. The judgments below and the injunction en­\ntered against the United States are vacated, and the cases\nare remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 553 U.

The Court’s opinion makes\nclear that those circumstances include the following: (1)\nOmar and Munaf “voluntarily traveled to Iraq.” Ante, at\n16. They are being held (2) in the “territory” of (3) an\n“all[y]” of the United States, ante, at 22, (4) by our troops,\nsee ante, at 8, (5) “during ongoing hostilities” that (6)\n“involv[e] our troops,” ante, at 22. (7) The government of a\nforeign sovereign, Iraq, has decided to prosecute them “for\ncrimes committed on its soil.” Ante, at 17. And (8) “the\nState Department has determined that . . . the department\nthat would have authority over Munaf and Omar . . . as\nwell as its prison and detention facilities have generally\n2                     MUNAF v. GEREN\n\n                     SOUTER, J., concurring\n\nmet internationally accepted standards for basic prisoner\nneeds.” Ante, at 25 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBecause I consider these circumstances essential to the\nCourt’s holding, I join its opinion.\n  The Court accordingly reserves judgment on an “ex-\ntreme case in which the Executive has determined that a\ndetainee [in United States custody] is likely to be tortured\nbut decides to transfer him anyway.” Ante, at 24–25. I\nwould add that nothing in today’s opinion should be read\nas foreclosing relief for a citizen of the United States who\nresists transfer, say, from the American military to a\nforeign government for prosecution in a case of that sort,\nand I would extend the caveat to a case in which the prob-\nability of torture is well documented, even if the Executive\nfails to acknowledge it. Although the Court rightly points\nout that any likelihood of extreme mistreatment at the\nreceiving government’s hands is a proper matter for the\npolitical branches to consider, see ante, at 23–24, if the\npolitical branches did favor transfer it would be in order to\nask whether substantive due process bars the Government\nfrom consigning its own people to torture. And although\nthe Court points out that habeas is aimed at securing\nrelease, not protective detention, see ante, at 16, habeas\nwould not be the only avenue open to an objecting pris-\noner; “where federally protected rights [are threatened], it\nhas been the rule from the beginning that courts will be\nalert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary\nrelief,” Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946).\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145797/", "sha1": "9bcff0e661043c22031b707ff82cd4eb04f35507", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2007-051", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:00"}
