Williams, Solicitor General, Janet A. Metcalf, Assistant Attorney General, Salem, Oregon, for Respondents.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question in this case is whether a public employee can state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause by alleging that she was arbitrarily treated differently from other similarly situated employees, with no assertion that the different treatment was based on the employee's membership in any particular class. We hold that such a \"class-of-one\" theory of equal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2149</span> protection has no place in the public employment context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Anup Engquist, the petitioner in this case, was hired in 1992 by Norma Corristan to be an international food standard specialist for the Export Service Center (ESC), a laboratory within the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA). During the course of her employment, Engquist experienced repeated problems with Joseph Hyatt, another ODA employee, complaining to Corristan that he had made false statements about her and otherwise made her life difficult. Corristan responded by directing Hyatt to attend diversity and anger management training.</p>\n<p>In 2001, John Szczepanski, an assistant director of ODA, assumed responsibility over ESC, supervising Corristan, Hyatt, and Engquist. Szczepanski told a client that he could not \"control\" Engquist, and that Engquist and Corristan \"would be gotten rid of.\" When Engquist and Hyatt both applied for a vacant managerial post within ESC, Szczepanski chose Hyatt despite Engquist's greater experience in the relevant field. Later that year, during a round of across-the-board budget cuts in Oregon, Szczepanski eliminated Corristan's position. Finally, on January 31, 2002, Engquist was informed that her position was being eliminated because of reorganization. Engquist's collective-bargaining agreement gave her the opportunity either to \"bump\" to another position at her level, or to take a demotion. She was found unqualified for the only other position at her level and declined a demotion, and was therefore effectively laid off.</p>\n<p>Engquist subsequently brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon against ODA, Szczepanski, and Hyatt, all respondents here, alleging violations of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and state law. As to Engquist's equal protection claim, she alleged that the defendants discriminated against her on the basis of her race, sex, and national origin. She also brought what is known as a \"class-of-one\" equal protection claim, alleging that she was fired not because she was a member of an identified class (unlike her race, sex, and national origin claims), but simply for \"arbitrary, vindictive, and malicious reasons.\" App. 10.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted the respondents' motion for summary judgment as to some of Engquist's claims, but allowed others to go forward, including each of the equal protection claims. As relevant to this case, the District Court found Engquist's class-of-one equal protection claim legally viable, deciding that the class-of-one theory was fully applicable in the employment context. Civ. No. 02-1637-AS (D.Ore., Sept. 14, 2004), App. 58, 2004 WL 2066748, *5. The court held that Engquist could succeed on that theory if she could prove \"that she was singled out as a result of animosity on the part of Hyatt and Szczepanski\"\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> \"that their actions were spiteful efforts to punish her for reasons unrelated to any legitimate state objective\"\u0097and if she could demonstrate, on the basis of that animosity, that \"she was treated differently than others who were similarly situated.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The jury rejected Engquist's claims of discrimination for membership in a suspect class\u0097her race, sex, and national origin claims\u0097but found in her favor on the class-of-one claim. Specifically, the jury found that Hyatt and Szczepanski \"intentionally treat[ed] [Engquist] differently than others similarly situated with respect to the denial of her promotion, termination of her employment, or denial of bumping rights without any rational basis and solely <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2150</span> for arbitrary, vindictive or malicious reasons.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4. The jury also found for Engquist on several of her other claims, and awarded her $175,000 in compensatory damages and $250,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part. It recognized that this Court had upheld a class-of-one equal protection challenge to state legislative and regulatory action in <i>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech,</i> 528 U.S. 562, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000) (<i>per curiam</i>). 478 F.3d 985, 992-993 (C.A.9 2007). The court below also acknowledged that other Circuits had applied <i>Olech</i> in the public employment context, <i>id.,</i> at 993 (citing cases), but it disagreed with those courts on the ground that our cases have routinely afforded government greater leeway when it acts as employer rather than regulator, <i>id.,</i> at 993-996. The court concluded that extending the class-of-one theory of equal protection to the public employment context would lead to undue judicial interference in state employment practices and \"completely invalidate the practice of public at-will employment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 995. The court accordingly held that the class-of-one theory is \"inapplicable to decisions made by public employers with regard to their employees.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 996.</p>\n<p>Judge Reinhardt dissented, \"agree[ing] with the other circuits that the class-of-one theory of equal protection is applicable to public employment decisions.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1010. We granted certiorari to resolve this disagreement in the lower courts, 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 977, 169 L.Ed.2d 800 (2008), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Engquist argues that the Equal Protection Clause forbids public employers from irrationally treating one employee differently from others similarly situated, regardless of whether the different treatment is based on the employee's membership in a particular class. She reasons that in <i>Olech, supra,</i> we recognized in the regulatory context a similar class-of-one theory of equal protection, Brief for Petitioner 14-15; that the Equal Protection Clause protects individuals, not classes, <i>id.,</i> at 15-17; that the Clause proscribes \"discrimination arising not only from a legislative act but also from the conduct of an administrative official,\" <i>id.,</i> at 17; and that the Constitution applies to the State not only when it acts as regulator, but also when it acts as employer, <i>id.,</i> at 23-29. Thus, Engquist concludes that class-of-one claims can be brought against public employers just as against any other state actors, <i>id.,</i> at 29-32, and that differential treatment of government employees\u0097even when not based on membership in a class or group\u0097violates the Equal Protection Clause unless supported by a rational basis, <i>id.,</i> at 32, 39-45.</p>\n<p>We do not quarrel with the premises of Engquist's argument. It is well settled that the Equal Protection Clause \"protect[s] persons, not groups,\" <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a,</i> 515 U.S. 200, 227, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995) (emphasis omitted), and that the Clause's protections apply to administrative as well as legislative acts, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co.,</i> 207 U.S. 20, 35-36, 28 S.Ct. 7, 52 L.Ed. 78 (1907). It is equally well settled that States do not escape the strictures of the Equal Protection Clause in their role as employers. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>New York City Transit Authority v. Beazer,</i> 440 U.S. 568, 99 S.Ct. 1355, 59 L.Ed.2d 587 (1979); <i>Harrah Independent School Dist. v. Martin,</i> 440 U.S. 194, 99 S.Ct. 1062, 59 L.Ed.2d 248 (1979) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia,</i> 427 U.S. 307, 96 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2151</span> 2562, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976) (<i>per curiam</i>). We do not, however, agree that Engquist's conclusion follows from these premises. Our traditional view of the core concern of the Equal Protection Clause as a shield against arbitrary classifications, combined with unique considerations applicable when the government acts as employer as opposed to sovereign, lead us to conclude that the class-of-one theory of equal protection does not apply in the public employment context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We have long held the view that there is a crucial difference, with respect to constitutional analysis, between the government exercising \"the power to regulate or license, as lawmaker,\" and the government acting \"as proprietor, to manage [its] internal operation.\" <i>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers v. McElroy,</i> 367 U.S. 886, 896, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961). This distinction has been particularly clear in our review of state action in the context of public employment. Thus, \"the government as employer indeed has far broader powers than does the government as sovereign.\" <i>Waters v. Churchill,</i> 511 U.S. 661, 671, 114 S.Ct. 1878, 128 L.Ed.2d 686 (1994) (plurality opinion). \"[T]he extra power the government has in this area comes from the nature of the government's mission as employer. Government agencies are charged by law with doing particular tasks. Agencies hire employees to help do those tasks as effectively and efficiently as possible.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 674-675, 114 S.Ct. 1878. See also <i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 150-151, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983) (explaining that the government has a legitimate interest \"in `promot[ing] efficiency and integrity in the discharge of official duties, and [in] maintain[ing] proper discipline in the public service'\" (quoting <i>Ex parte Curtis,</i> 106 U.S. 371, 373, 1 S.Ct. 381, 27 L.Ed. 232 (1882) (alterations in original))). \"The government's interest in achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as possible is elevated from a relatively subordinate interest when it acts as sovereign to a significant one when it acts as employer.\" <i>Waters, supra,</i> at 675, 114 S.Ct. 1878 (plurality opinion). Given the \"common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter,\" <i>Connick, supra,</i> at 143, 103 S.Ct. 1684, \"constitutional review of government employment decisions must rest on different principles than review of . . . restraints imposed by the government as sovereign,\" <i>Waters, supra,</i> at 674, 114 S.Ct. 1878 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>In light of these basic principles, we have often recognized that government has significantly greater leeway in its dealings with citizen employees than it does when it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at large. Thus, for example, we have held that the Fourth Amendment does not require public employers to obtain warrants before conducting a search of an employee's office. <i>O'Connor v. Ortega,</i> 480 U.S. 709, 721-722, 107 S.Ct. 1492, 94 L.Ed.2d 714 (1987) (plurality opinion). See also <i>id.,</i> at 732, 107 S.Ct. 1492 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Although we recognized that the \"legitimate privacy interests of public employees in the private objects they bring to the workplace may be substantial,\" we found that \"[a]gainst these privacy interests . . . must be balanced the realities of the workplace, which strongly suggest that a warrant requirement would be unworkable.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 721, 107 S.Ct. 1492 (plurality opinion). We have also found that the Due Process Clause does not protect a public employee from discharge, even when such discharge was mistaken or unreasonable. See <i>Bishop v. Wood,</i> 426 U.S. 341, 350, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976) (\"The Due <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2152</span> Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not a guarantee against incorrect or ill-advised personnel decisions\").</p>\n<p>Our public-employee speech cases are particularly instructive. In <i>Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), we explained that, in analyzing a claim that a public employee was deprived of First Amendment rights by her employer, we must seek \"a balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\"</p>\n<p>We analyzed the contours of this balance more fully in <i>Connick v. Myers, supra</i><i>.</i> We explained that the First Amendment protects public-employee speech only when it falls within the core of First Amendment protection\u0097speech on matters of public concern. We recognized that the \"`First Amendment does not protect speech and assembly only to the extent it can be characterized as political,'\" and that the government therefore could not generally prohibit or punish, in its capacity as sovereign, speech on the ground that it does not touch upon matters of public concern, <i>id.,</i> at 147, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (quoting <i>Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn.,</i> 389 U.S. 217, 223, 88 S.Ct. 353, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967)). But \"[w]hen employee expression cannot be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community, government officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices.\" <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S., at 146, 103 S.Ct. 1684. As we explained, \"absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee's behavior.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 147, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (citing <i>Bishop, supra,</i> at 349-350, 96 S.Ct. 2074).</p>\n<p>Our precedent in the public-employee context therefore establishes two main principles: First, although government employees do not lose their constitutional rights when they accept their positions, those rights must be balanced against the realities of the employment context. Second, in striking the appropriate balance, we consider whether the asserted employee right implicates the basic concerns of the relevant constitutional provision, or whether the claimed right can more readily give way to the requirements of the government as employer. With these principles in mind, we come to the question whether a class-of-one theory of equal protection is cognizable in the public employment context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Our equal protection jurisprudence has typically been concerned with governmental classifications that \"affect some groups of citizens differently than others.\" <i>McGowan v. Maryland,</i> 366 U.S. 420, 425, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961). See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ross v. Moffitt,</i> 417 U.S. 600, 609, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974) (\"`Equal Protection' . . . emphasizes disparity in treatment by a State between classes of individuals whose situations are arguably indistinguishable\"); <i>San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez,</i> 411 U.S. 1, 60, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring) (\"[T]he basic concern of the Equal Protection Clause is with state legislation whose purpose or effect is to create discrete and objectively identifiable classes\"). Plaintiffs in such cases generally allege that they have been arbitrarily classified as members of an \"identifiable group.\" <i>Personnel Administrator</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2153</span> <i>of Mass. v. Feeney,</i> 442 U.S. 256, 279, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979).</p>\n<p>Engquist correctly argues, however, that we recognized in <i>Olech</i> that an equal protection claim can in some circumstances be sustained even if the plaintiff has not alleged class-based discrimination, but instead claims that she has been irrationally singled out as a so-called \"class of one.\" In <i>Olech,</i> a property owner had asked the village of Willowbrook to connect her property to the municipal water supply. Although the village had required only a 15-foot easement from other property owners seeking access to the water supply, the village conditioned Olech's connection on a grant of a 33-foot easement. Olech sued the village, claiming that the village's requirement of an easement 18 feet longer than the norm violated the Equal Protection Clause. Although Olech had not alleged that the village had discriminated against her based on membership in an identifiable class, we held that her complaint stated a valid claim under the Equal Protection Clause because it alleged that she had \"been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\" 528 U.S., at 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073 (citing <i>Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County,</i> 260 U.S. 441, 43 S.Ct. 190, 67 L.Ed. 340 (1923), and <i>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Commission of Webster Cty.,</i> 488 U.S. 336, 109 S.Ct. 633, 102 L.Ed.2d 688 (1989)).</p>\n<p>Recognition of the class-of-one theory of equal protection on the facts in <i>Olech</i> was not so much a departure from the principle that the Equal Protection Clause is concerned with arbitrary government classification, as it was an application of that principle. That case involved the government's regulation of property. Similarly, the cases upon which the Court in <i>Olech</i> relied concerned property assessment and taxation schemes. See <i>Allegheny Pittsburgh, supra</i>; <i>Sioux City Bridge, supra</i><i>.</i> We expect such legislative or regulatory classifications to apply \"without respect to persons,\" to borrow a phrase from the judicial oath. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 453. As we explained long ago, the Fourteenth Amendment \"requires that all persons subjected to . . . legislation shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions, both in the privileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed.\" <i>Hayes v. Missouri,</i> 120 U.S. 68, 71-72, 7 S.Ct. 350, 30 L.Ed. 578 (1887). When those who appear similarly situated are nevertheless treated differently, the Equal Protection Clause requires at least a rational reason for the difference, to assure that all persons subject to legislation or regulation are indeed being \"treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions.\" Thus, when it appears that an individual is being singled out by the government, the specter of arbitrary classification is fairly raised, and the Equal Protection Clause requires a \"rational basis for the difference in treatment.\" <i>Olech,</i> 528 U.S., at 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073.</p>\n<p>What seems to have been significant in <i>Olech</i> and the cases on which it relied was the existence of a clear standard against which departures, even for a single plaintiff, could be readily assessed. There was no indication in <i>Olech</i> that the zoning board was exercising discretionary authority based on subjective, individualized determinations\u0097at least not with regard to easement length, however typical such determinations may be as a general zoning matter. See <i>id.,</i> at 565, 120 S.Ct. 1073 (BREYER, J., concurring in result). Rather, the complaint alleged that the board consistently required only a 15-foot easement, but subjected Olech to a 33-foot easement. This differential treatment raised a concern of arbitrary classification, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2154</span> and we therefore required that the State provide a rational basis for it.</p>\n<p>In <i>Allegheny Pittsburgh,</i> cited by the <i>Olech</i> Court, the applicable standard was market value, but the county departed from that standard in basing some assessments on quite dated purchase prices. Again, there was no suggestion that the \"dramatic differences in valuation\" for similar property parcels, 488 U.S., at 341, 109 S.Ct. 633, were based on subjective considerations of the sort on which appraisers often rely, see <i>id.,</i> at 338-342, 345, 109 S.Ct. 633. <i>Sioux City Bridge,</i> also cited in <i>Olech,</i> was the same sort of case, recognizing an equal protection claim when one taxpayer's property was assessed at 100 percent of its value, while all other property was assessed at 55 percent, without regard to articulated differences in the properties. See 260 U.S., at 445-447, 43 S.Ct. 190.</p>\n<p>There are some forms of state action, however, which by their nature involve discretionary decisionmaking based on a vast array of subjective, individualized assessments. In such cases the rule that people should be \"treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions\" is not violated when one person is treated differently from others, because treating like individuals differently is an accepted consequence of the discretion granted. In such situations, allowing a challenge based on the arbitrary singling out of a particular person would undermine the very discretion that such state officials are entrusted to exercise.</p>\n<p>Suppose, for example, that a traffic officer is stationed on a busy highway where people often drive above the speed limit, and there is no basis upon which to distinguish them. If the officer gives only one of those people a ticket, it may be good English to say that the officer has created a class of people that did not get speeding tickets, and a \"class of one\" that did. But assuming that it is in the nature of the particular government activity that not all speeders can be stopped and ticketed, complaining that one has been singled out for no reason does not invoke the fear of improper government classification. Such a complaint, rather, challenges the legitimacy of the underlying action itself\u0097the decision to ticket speeders under such circumstances. Of course, an allegation that speeding tickets are given out on the basis of race or sex would state an equal protection claim, because such discriminatory classifications implicate basic equal protection concerns. But allowing an equal protection claim on the ground that a ticket was given to one person and not others, even if for no discernible or articulable reason, would be incompatible with the discretion inherent in the challenged action. It is no proper challenge to what in its nature is a subjective, individualized decision that it was subjective and individualized.</p>\n<p>This principle applies most clearly in the employment context, for employment decisions are quite often subjective and individualized, resting on a wide array of factors that are difficult to articulate and quantify. As Engquist herself points out, \"[u]nlike the zoning official, the public employer often must take into account the individual personalities and interpersonal relationships of employees in the workplace. The close relationship between the employer and employee, and the varied needs and interests involved in the employment context, mean that considerations such as concerns over personality conflicts that would be unreasonable as grounds for `arm's-length' government decisions (<i>e.g.,</i> zoning, licensing) may well justify different treatment of a public employee.\" Brief for Petitioner 48. Unlike the context of arm's-length regulation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2155</span> such as in <i>Olech,</i> treating seemingly similarly situated individuals differently in the employment context is par for the course.</p>\n<p>Thus, the class-of-one theory of equal protection\u0097which presupposes that like individuals should be treated alike, and that to treat them differently is to classify them in a way that must survive at least rationality review\u0097is simply a poor fit in the public employment context. To treat employees differently is not to classify them in a way that raises equal protection concerns. Rather, it is simply to exercise the broad discretion that typically characterizes the employer-employee relationship. A challenge that one has been treated individually in this context, instead of like everyone else, is a challenge to the underlying nature of the government action.</p>\n<p>Of course, that is not to say that the Equal Protection Clause, like other constitutional provisions, does not apply to public employers. Indeed, our cases make clear that the Equal Protection Clause is implicated when the government makes class-based decisions in the employment context, treating distinct groups of individuals categorically differently. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Beazer,</i> 440 U.S., at 593, 99 S.Ct. 1355 (upholding city's exclusion of methadone users from employment under rational-basis review); <i>Martin,</i> 440 U.S., at 199-201, 99 S.Ct. 1062 (classification between teachers who had complied with a continuing-education requirement and those who had not is rational and does not violate the Equal Protection Clause); <i>Murgia,</i> 427 U.S., at 314-317, 96 S.Ct. 2562 (upholding a mandatory retirement age\u0097a classification based on age\u0097under rational-basis review). The dissent's broad statement that we \"excep[t] state employees from the Fourteenth Amendment's protection against unequal and irrational treatment at the hands of the State,\" <i>post,</i> at 2158 (opinion of STEVENS, J.), is thus plainly not correct. But we have never found the Equal Protection Clause implicated in the specific circumstance where, as here, government employers are alleged to have made an individualized, subjective personnel decision in a seemingly arbitrary or irrational manner.</p>\n<p>This is not surprising, given the historical understanding of the nature of government employment. We long ago recognized the \"settled principle that government employment, in the absence of legislation, can be revoked at the will of the appointing officer.\" <i>McElroy,</i> 367 U.S., at 896, 81 S.Ct. 1743. The basic principle of at-will employment is that an employee may be terminated for a \"`good reason, bad reason, or no reason at all.'\" Reply Brief for Petitioner 27. See <i>Andrews v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R.

See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bishop, supra,</i> at 349-350, 96 S.Ct. 2074.</p>\n<p>State employers cannot, of course, take personnel actions that would independently violate the Constitution. See <i>supra,</i> at 2150-2153. But recognition of a class-of-one theory of equal protection in the public employment context\u0097that is, a claim that the State treated an employee differently from others for a bad reason, or for no reason at all\u0097is simply contrary to the concept of at-will employment. The Constitution does not require repudiating that familiar doctrine.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Congress and all the States have, for the most part, replaced at-will employment with various statutory schemes protecting public employees from discharge for impermissible reasons. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(10) (2006 ed.) (supervisor of covered federal employee may not \"discriminate . . . on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others\"). See also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 20-21. But a government's decision to limit the ability of public employers to fire at will is an act of legislative grace, not constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p>Indeed, recognizing the sort of claim Engquist presses could jeopardize the delicate balance governments have struck between the rights of public employees and \"the government's legitimate purpose in `promot[ing] efficiency and integrity in the discharge of official duties, and [in] maintain[ing] proper discipline in the public service.'\" <i>Connick, supra,</i> at 151, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (quoting <i>Ex parte Curtis,</i> 106 U.S., at 373, 1 S.Ct. 381; alterations in original). Thus, for example, although most federal employees are covered by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. 95-454, Congress has specifically excluded some groups of employees from its protection, see, <i>e.g.,</i> 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(C) (2006 ed.) (excluding from coverage, <i>inter alia,</i> the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency). Were we to find that the Equal Protection Clause subjects the Government to equal protection review for every allegedly arbitrary employment action, we will have undone Congress's (and the States') careful work.</p>\n<p>In concluding that the class-of-one theory of equal protection has no application in the public employment context\u0097and that is all we decide\u0097we are guided, as in the past, by the \"common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.\" <i>Connick, supra,</i> at 143, 103 S.Ct. 1684. If, as Engquist suggests, plaintiffs need not claim discrimination on the basis of membership in some class or group, but rather may argue only that they were treated by their employers worse than other employees similarly situated, any personnel action in which a wronged employee can conjure up a claim of differential treatment will suddenly become the basis for a federal constitutional claim. Indeed, an allegation of arbitrary differential treatment could be made in nearly every instance of an assertedly wrongful employment action\u0097not only hiring and firing decisions, but any personnel action, such as promotion, salary, or work assignments\u0097on the theory that other employees were not treated wrongfully. See 478 F.3d, at 995. On Engquist's view, every one of these employment decisions by a government employer would become the basis for an equal protection complaint.</p>\n<p>Engquist assures us that accepting her view would not pose too much of a practical problem. Specifically, Engquist argues that a plaintiff in a class-of-one employment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2157</span> case would have to prove that the government's differential treatment was intentional, that the plaintiff was treated differently from other similarly situated persons, and that the unequal treatment was not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. Brief for Petitioner 36-39. And because a \"governmental employment decision is . . . rational whenever the discrimination relates to a legitimate government interest,\" it is in practice \"difficult for plaintiffs to show that the government has failed to meet this standard.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 41. Justice STEVENS makes a similar argument, stating \"that all but a handful [of class-of-one complaints] are dismissed well in advance of trial.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2161.</p>\n<p>We agree that, even if we accepted Engquist's claim, it would be difficult for a plaintiff to show that an employment decision is arbitrary. But this submission is beside the point. The practical problem with allowing class-of-one claims to go forward in this context is not that it will be too easy for plaintiffs to prevail, but that governments will be forced to defend a multitude of such claims in the first place, and courts will be obliged to sort through them in a search for the proverbial needle in a haystack. The Equal Protection Clause does not require \"[t]his displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision.\" <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. 410, 423, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006).</p>\n<p>In short, ratifying a class-of-one theory of equal protection in the context of public employment would impermissibly \"constitutionalize the employee grievance.\" <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S., at 154, 103 S.Ct. 1684. \"The federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the multitude of personnel decisions that are made daily by public agencies.\" <i>Bishop, supra,</i> at 349, 96 S.Ct. 2074. Public employees typically have a variety of protections from just the sort of personnel actions about which Engquist complains, but the Equal Protection Clause is not one of them.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice SOUTER and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Congress has provided a judicial remedy for individuals whose federal constitutional rights are violated by state action, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<sup>[1]</sup> In prior cases, we have refused to craft <i>new</i> remedies for the violation of constitutional rights of federal employees, <i>Bush v. Lucas,</i> 462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983), or for the nonconstitutional claims of state employees, <i>Bishop v. Wood,</i> 426 U.S. 341, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976). But refusal to give effect to the congressionally mandated remedy embodied in \u00a7 1983 would be impermissible. To avoid this result, the Court today concludes that Engquist suffered no constitutional violation at all, and that there was thus no harm to be remedied. In so holding, the Court\u0097as it did in <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. 410, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006)\u0097carves a novel exception out of state employees' constitutional rights. In <i>Garcetti,</i> the Court created a new substantive rule excepting a category of speech by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2158</span> state employees from the protection of the First Amendment. Today, the Court creates a new substantive rule excepting state employees from the Fourteenth Amendment's protection against unequal and irrational treatment at the hands of the State. Even if some surgery were truly necessary to prevent governments from being forced to defend a multitude of equal protection \"class of one\" claims, the Court should use a scalpel rather than a meat-axe.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech,</i> 528 U.S. 562, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> applied a rule that had been an accepted part of our equal protection jurisprudence for decades: Unless state action that intentionally singles out an individual, or a class of individuals, for adverse treatment is supported by some rational justification, it violates the Fourteenth Amendment's command that no State shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"</p>\n<p>Our opinion in <i>Olech</i> emphasized that the legal issue would have been the same whether the class consisted of one or five members, because \"the number of individuals in a class is immaterial for equal protection analysis.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, n. The outcome of that case was not determined by the size of the disadvantaged class, and the majority does not\u0097 indeed cannot\u0097dispute the settled principle that the Equal Protection Clause protects persons, not groups. See <i>ante,</i> at 2150-2151.</p>\n<p>Nor did the outcome in <i>Olech</i> turn on the fact that the Village was discriminating against a property owner rather than an employee. The majority does not dispute that the strictures of the Equal Protection Clause apply to the States in their role as employers as well as regulators. See <i>ante,</i> at 2151. And indeed, we have made clear that \"the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and other provisions of the Federal Constitution afford protection to employees who serve the government as well as to those who are served by them, and \u00a7 1983 provides a cause of action for all citizens injured by an abridgment of those protections.\" <i>Collins v. Harker Heights,</i> 503 U.S. 115, 119-120, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992).</p>\n<p>Rather, the outcome of <i>Olech</i> was dictated solely by the absence of a rational basis for the discrimination. As we explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Our cases have recognized successful equal protection claims brought by a `class of one,' where the plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment. In so doing, we have explained that `[t]he purpose of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is to secure every person within the State's jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination, whether occasioned by express terms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[Olech's] complaint also alleged that the Village's demand was `irrational and wholly arbitrary' . . . . These allegations, quite apart from the Village's subjective motivation, are sufficient to state a claim for relief under traditional equal protection analysis.\" 528 U.S., at 564, 565, 120 S.Ct. 1073 (some internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Here, as in <i>Olech,</i> Engquist alleged that the State's actions were arbitrary and irrational. In response, the State offered no explanation whatsoever for its decisions; it did not claim that Engquist was a subpar worker, or even that her personality made <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2159</span> her a poor fit in the workplace or that her colleagues simply did not enjoy working with her. In fact, the State explicitly <i>disclaimed</i> the existence of any workplace or performance-based rationale.<sup>[2]</sup> See, <i>e.g.,</i> Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, 19. The jury proceeded to find that the respondents intentionally treated Engquist \"differently than others similarly situated with respect to the . . . termination of her employment. . . without any rational basis and solely for arbitrary, vindictive or malicious reasons.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4. The jury's verdict thus established that there was no rational basis for either treating Engquist differently from other employees or for the termination of her employment. The State does not dispute this finding. Under our reasoning in <i>Olech,</i> the absence of any justification for the discrimination sufficed to establish the constitutional violation.</p>\n<p>The majority nonetheless concludes, based on \"unique considerations applicable when the government acts as employer,\" that the \"class of one\" theory of equal protection is not applicable in the public employment context. <i>Ante,</i> at 2151. Its conclusion is based upon speculation about inapt hypothetical cases, and an incorrect evaluation of the importance of the government's interest in preserving a regime of \"at will\" employment. Its reasoning is flawed on both counts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The majority asserts that public-employment decisions should be carved out of our equal protection jurisprudence because employment decisions (as opposed to, for example, zoning decisions) are inherently discretionary. I agree that employers must be free to exercise discretionary authority. But there is a clear distinction between an exercise of discretion and an arbitrary decision. A discretionary decision represents a choice of one among two or more rational alternatives. See 1 H. Hart &amp; A. Sacks, The Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law 162 (Tent. ed.1958) (defining discretion as \"the power to choose between two or more courses of action each of which is thought of as permissible\"). The choice may be mistaken or unwise without being irrational. If the arguments favoring each alternative are closely balanced, the need to make a choice may justify using a coin toss as a tie breaker. Moreover, the Equal Protection Clause proscribes arbitrary decisions\u0097decisions unsupported by any rational basis\u0097not unwise ones. Accordingly, a discretionary decision with any \"reasonably conceivable\" rational justification will not support an equal protection claim; only a truly arbitrary one will. There is therefore no need to create an exception for the public-employment context in order to prevent these discretionary decisions from giving rise equal protection claims.</p>\n<p>The hypothetical situations posited by the majority do not prove otherwise. The hypothetical traffic officer described in the Court's opinion, <i>ante,</i> at 2154, had a rational basis for giving a ticket to <i>every</i> speeder passing him on the highway. His inability to arrest every driver in sight provides an adequate justification for making a random choice from a group of equally guilty and equally accessible violators. As such, the Court is quite correct in stating that \"allowing an equal protection claim on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2160</span> ground that a ticket was given to one person and not others, even if for no discernible or articulable reason, would be incompatible with the discretion inherent in the challenged action.\" <i>Ibid.</i> If there were no justification for the arrest, there would be no need to invoke the Equal Protection Clause because the officer's conduct would violate the Fourth Amendment. But as noted, a random choice among rational alternatives does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p>A comparable hypothetical decision in the employment context (<i>e.g.,</i> a supervisor who is required to eliminate one position due to an involuntary reduction-in-force and who chooses to terminate one of several equally culpable employees) also differs from the instant case insofar as it assumes the existence of a rational basis for the individual decision. The fact that a supervisor might not be able to explain why he terminated one employee rather than another will not give rise to an equal protection claim so long as there was a rational basis for the termination itself and for the decision to terminate just one, rather than all, of the culpable employees.</p>\n<p>Instead of using a scalpel to confine so-called \"class of one\" claims to cases involving a complete absence of any conceivable rational basis for the adverse action and the differential treatment of the plaintiff, the Court adopts an unnecessarily broad rule that tolerates arbitrary and irrational decisions in the employment context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The majority's decision also rests on the premise that \"[t]he Constitution does not require repudiating th[e] familiar doctrine\" of at-will employment. <i>Ante,</i> at 2156. In the 1890's that doctrine applied broadly to government employment, see <i>McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford,</i> 155 Mass. 216, 29 N.E. 517 (1892), but for many years now \"`the theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.'\" <i>Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y.,</i> 385 U.S. 589, 605-606, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967). Indeed, recent constitutional decisions and statutory enactments have all but nullified the significance of the doctrine. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); <i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990); see also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(10) (2006 ed.) (supervisor of covered federal employee may not \"discriminate . . . on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others\"). Accordingly, preserving the remnants of \"at-will\" employment provides a feeble justification for creating a broad exception to a well-established category of constitutional protections.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Presumably the concern that actually motivates today's decision is fear that governments will be forced to defend against a multitude of \"class of one\" claims unless the Court wields its meat-axe forthwith. Experience demonstrates, however, that these claims are brought infrequently,<sup>[4]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2161</span> that the vast majority of such claims are asserted in complaints advancing other claims as well, and that all but a handful are dismissed well in advance of trial. Experience also demonstrates that there are in fact rare cases in which a petty tyrant has misused governmental power. Proof that such misuse was arbitrary because unsupported by any conceivable rational basis should suffice to establish a violation of the Equal Protection Clause without requiring its victim also to prove that the tyrant was motivated by a particular variety of class-based animus. When the allegations of a complaint plainly identify \"the proverbial needle in a haystack,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2157, a federal court should not misconstrue the Constitution in order to make it even easier to dismiss unmeritorious claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>In sum, there is no compelling reason to carve arbitrary public-employment decisions out of the well-established category of equal protection violations when the familiar rational review standard can sufficiently limit these claims to only wholly unjustified employment actions. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 1983 provides that \"[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.. . .\"</p>\n<p>[2]  But for this disclaimer, the lower court could have dismissed the claim if it discerned \"any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the [State's actions],\" even one not put forth by the State. <i>FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc.,</i> 508 U.S. 307, 313, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993). The disclaimer, however, negated that possibility.</p>\n<p>[3]  Moreover, equal protection scrutiny is not incompatible with at-will employment since courts applying rational-basis scrutiny are able to rely on any <i>conceivable</i> reason for government action, and the government therefore need not explain its actual reason for terminating or disciplining the employee.</p>\n<p>[4]  Prior to the Ninth Circuit's decision this case, \"class of one\" claims arising in the public-employment context were permitted by every court that was presented with one. Yet there have been only approximately 150 cases\u0097both in the district courts and the courts of appeals\u0097addressing such claims since <i>Olech.</i></p>\n\n</div>",

Argued April 21, 2008\u2014Decided June 9, 2008\nPetitioner Engquist, an Oregon public employee, filed suit against re-\n  spondents\u2014her agency, her supervisor, and a co-worker\u2014asserting,\n  inter alia, claims under the Equal Protection Clause: She alleged she\n  had been discriminated against based on her race, sex, and national\n  origin, and she also brought a so-called \u201cclass-of-one\u201d claim, alleging\n  that she was fired not because she was a member of an identified\n  class (unlike her race, sex, and national origin claims), but simply for\n  arbitrary, vindictive, and malicious reasons. The jury rejected the\n  class-membership equal protection claims, but found for Engquist on\n  her class-of-one claim. The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part.\n  Although recognizing that this Court had upheld a class-of-one equal\n  protection challenge to state legislative and regulatory action in Vil-\n  lage of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U. S. 562, the court below empha-\n  sized that this Court has routinely afforded government greater lee-\n  way when it acts as employer rather than regulator. The Court\n  concluded that extending the class-of-one theory to the public-\n  employment context would lead to undue judicial interference in\n  state employment practices and invalidate public at-will employ-\n  ment.\nHeld: The class-of-one theory of equal protection does not apply in the\n public employment context. Pp. 4\u201316.\n    (a) There is a crucial difference between the government exercising\n \u201cthe power to regulate or license, as lawmaker,\u201d and acting \u201cas pro-\n prietor, to manage [its] internal operation.\u201d Cafeteria & Restaurant\n Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 896. Thus, in the public-\n employment context, the Court has recognized that government has\n significantly greater leeway in its dealings with citizen employees\n2          ENGQUIST v. OREGON DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    than in bringing its sovereign power to bear on citizens at large. See,\n    e.g., O\u2019Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 721\u2013722. The relevant prece-\n    dent establishes two main principles: First, government employees do\n    not lose their constitutional rights when they go to work, but those\n    rights must be balanced against the realities of the employment con-\n    text. See, e.g., id., at 721. Second, in striking the appropriate bal-\n    ance, the Court considers whether the claimed employee right impli-\n    cates the relevant constitutional provision\u2019s basic concerns, or\n    whether the right can more readily give way to the requirements of\n    the government as employer. See, e.g., Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S.\n    138. Pp. 4\u20138.\n       (b) The Court\u2019s equal protection jurisprudence has typically been\n    concerned with governmental classifications that \u201caffect some groups\n    of citizens differently than others.\u201d McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S.\n    420, 425. Olech did recognize that a class-of-one equal protection\n    claim can in some circumstances be sustained. Its recognition of that\n    theory, however, was not so much a departure from the principle that\n    the Equal Protection Clause is concerned with arbitrary government\n    classification, as it was an application of that principle to the facts in\n    that case: The government singled Olech out with regard to its regu-\n    lation of property, and the cases upon which the Court relied con-\n    cerned property assessment and taxation schemes that were applied\n    in a singular way to particular citizens. What seems to have been\n    significant in Olech and the cited cases was the existence of a clear\n    standard against which departures, even for a single plaintiff, could\n    be readily assessed. This differential treatment raised a concern of\n    arbitrary classification, and therefore required that the State provide\n    a rational basis for it. There are some forms of state action, however,\n    which by their nature involve discretionary decisionmaking based on\n    a vast array of subjective, individualized assessments. In such cases\n    treating like individuals differently is an accepted consequence of the\n    discretion granted to governmental officials. This principle applies\n    most clearly in the employment context, where decisions are often\n    subjective and individualized, resting on a wide array of factors that\n    are difficult to articulate and quantify. Unlike the context of arm\u2019s-\n    length regulation, such as in Olech, treating seemingly similarly\n    situated individuals differently in the employment context is par for\n    the course. It is no proper challenge to what in its nature is a subjec-\n    tive and individualized decision that it was subjective and individual-\n    ized. That the Court has never found the Equal Protection Clause\n    implicated in this area is not surprising, given the historical under-\n    standing of the at-will nature of government employment. See, e.g.,\n    Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 896. Rec-\n    ognition of a claim that the State treated an employee differently\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

The Constitution does not require repu-\n  diating that familiar doctrine.

OREGON \n\n       DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 9, 2008]\n\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   The question in this case is whether a public employee\ncan state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause by\nalleging that she was arbitrarily treated differently from\nother similarly situated employees, with no assertion that\nthe different treatment was based on the employee\u2019s\nmembership in any particular class. We hold that such a\n\u201cclass-of-one\u201d theory of equal protection has no place in the\npublic employment context.\n                              I\n  Anup Engquist, the petitioner in this case, was hired in\n1992 by Norma Corristan to be an international food\nstandard specialist for the Export Service Center (ESC), a\nlaboratory within the Oregon Department of Agriculture\n(ODA). During the course of her employment, Engquist\nexperienced repeated problems with Joseph Hyatt, an-\nother ODA employee, complaining to Corristan that he\nhad made false statements about her and otherwise made\nher life difficult. Corristan responded by directing Hyatt\nto attend diversity and anger management training.\n2      ENGQUIST v. OREGON DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 2001, John Szczepanski, an assistant director of\nODA, assumed responsibility over ESC, supervising Cor-\nristan, Hyatt, and Engquist. Szczepanski told a client\nthat he could not \u201ccontrol\u201d Engquist, and that Engquist\nand Corristan \u201cwould be gotten rid of.\u201d When Engquist\nand Hyatt both applied for a vacant managerial post\nwithin ESC, Szczepanski chose Hyatt despite Engquist\u2019s\ngreater experience in the relevant field. Later that year,\nduring a round of across-the-board budget cuts in Oregon,\nSzczepanski eliminated Corristan\u2019s position. Finally, on\nJanuary 31, 2002, Engquist was informed that her posi-\ntion was being eliminated because of reorganization.\nEngquist\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement gave her the\nopportunity either to \u201cbump\u201d to another position at her\nlevel, or to take a demotion. She was found unqualified for\nthe only other position at her level and declined a demo-\ntion, and was therefore effectively laid off.\n   Engquist subsequently brought suit in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Oregon against\nODA, Szczepanski, and Hyatt, all respondents here, alleg-\ning violations of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the\nEqual Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Four-\nteenth Amendment, and state law. As to Engquist\u2019s equal\nprotection claim, she alleged that the defendants discrimi-\nnated against her on the basis of her race, sex, and na-\ntional origin. She also brought what is known as a \u201cclass-\nof-one\u201d equal protection claim, alleging that she was fired\nnot because she was a member of an identified class\n(unlike her race, sex, and national origin claims), but\nsimply for \u201carbitrary, vindictive, and malicious reasons.\u201d\nApp. 10.\n   The District Court granted the respondents\u2019 motion for\nsummary judgment as to some of Engquist\u2019s claims, but\nallowed others to go forward, including each of the equal\nprotection claims. As relevant to this case, the District\nCourt found Engquist\u2019s class-of-one equal protection claim\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlegally viable, deciding that the class-of-one theory was\nfully applicable in the employment context. Civ. No. 02\u2013\n1637\u2013AS (D. Ore., Sept. 14, 2004), App. 58, 2004 WL\n2066748, *5. The court held that Engquist could succeed\non that theory if she could prove \u201cthat she was singled out\nas a result of animosity on the part of Hyatt and Szcze-\npanski\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201cthat their actions were spiteful efforts to\npunish her for reasons unrelated to any legitimate state\nobjective\u201d\u2014and if she could demonstrate, on the basis of\nthat animosity, that \u201cshe was treated differently than\nothers who were similarly situated.\u201d Ibid.\n   The jury rejected Engquist\u2019s claims of discrimination for\nmembership in a suspect class\u2014her race, sex, and na-\ntional origin claims\u2014but found in her favor on the class-\nof-one claim. Specifically, the jury found that Hyatt and\nSzczepanski \u201cintentionally treat[ed] [Engquist] differently\nthan others similarly situated with respect to the denial of\nher promotion, termination of her employment, or denial\nof bumping rights without any rational basis and solely for\narbitrary, vindictive or malicious reasons.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 3\u20134. The jury also found for Engquist on several\nof her other claims, and awarded her $175,000 in compen-\nsatory damages and $250,000 in punitive damages.\n   The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part. It\nrecognized that this Court had upheld a class-of-one equal\nprotection challenge to state legislative and regulatory\naction in Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U. S. 562\n(2000) (per curiam). 478 F. 3d 985, 992\u2013993 (CA9 2007).\nThe court below also acknowledged that other Circuits had\napplied Olech in the public employment context, id., at 993\n(citing cases), but it disagreed with those courts on the\nground that our cases have routinely afforded government\ngreater leeway when it acts as employer rather than\nregulator, id., at 993\u2013996. The court concluded that ex-\ntending the class-of-one theory of equal protection to the\npublic employment context would lead to undue judicial\n4      ENGQUIST v. OREGON DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterference in state employment practices and \u201ccom-\npletely invalidate the practice of public at-will employ-\nment.\u201d Id., at 995. The court accordingly held that the\nclass-of-one theory is \u201cinapplicable to decisions made by\npublic employers with regard to their employees.\u201d Id., at\n996.\n   Judge Reinhardt dissented, \u201cagree[ing] with the other\ncircuits that the class-of-one theory of equal protection is\napplicable to public employment decisions.\u201d Id., at 1010.\nWe granted certiorari to resolve this disagreement in the\nlower courts, 552 U. S. __ (2008), and now affirm.\n                               II\n   Engquist argues that the Equal Protection Clause for-\nbids public employers from irrationally treating one em-\nployee differently from others similarly situated, regard-\nless of whether the different treatment is based on the\nemployee\u2019s membership in a particular class. She reasons\nthat in Olech, supra, we recognized in the regulatory\ncontext a similar class-of-one theory of equal protection,\nBrief for Petitioner 14\u201315; that the Equal Protection\nClause protects individuals, not classes, id., at 15\u201317; that\nthe Clause proscribes \u201cdiscrimination arising not only\nfrom a legislative act but also from the conduct of an\nadministrative official,\u201d id., at 17; and that the Constitu-\ntion applies to the State not only when it acts as regulator,\nbut also when it acts as employer, id., at 23\u201329. Thus,\nEngquist concludes that class-of-one claims can be brought\nagainst public employers just as against any other state\nactors, id., at 29\u201332, and that differential treatment of\ngovernment employees\u2014even when not based on member-\nship in a class or group\u2014violates the Equal Protection\nClause unless supported by a rational basis, id., at 32, 39\u2013\n45.\n   We do not quarrel with the premises of Engquist\u2019s ar-\ngument. It is well settled that the Equal Protection\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nClause \u201cprotect[s] persons, not groups,\u201d Adarand Con\u00ad\nstructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995) (emphasis\nomitted), and that the Clause\u2019s protections apply to ad-\nministrative as well as legislative acts, see, e.g., Raymond\nv. Chicago Union Traction Co., 207 U. S. 20, 35\u201336 (1907).\nIt is equally well settled that States do not escape the\nstrictures of the Equal Protection Clause in their role as\nemployers. See, e.g., New York City Transit Authority v.\nBeazer, 440 U. S. 568 (1979); Harrah Independent School\nDist. v. Martin, 440 U. S. 194 (1979) (per curiam); Massa\u00ad\nchusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U. S. 307 (1976)\n(per curiam). We do not, however, agree that Engquist\u2019s\nconclusion follows from these premises. Our traditional\nview of the core concern of the Equal Protection Clause as\na shield against arbitrary classifications, combined with\nunique considerations applicable when the government\nacts as employer as opposed to sovereign, lead us to con-\nclude that the class-of-one theory of equal protection does\nnot apply in the public employment context.\n                             A\n   We have long held the view that there is a crucial differ-\nence, with respect to constitutional analysis, between the\ngovernment exercising \u201cthe power to regulate or license, as\nlawmaker,\u201d and the government acting \u201cas proprietor, to\nmanage [its] internal operation.\u201d Cafeteria & Restaurant\nWorkers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 896 (1961). This dis-\ntinction has been particularly clear in our review of state\naction in the context of public employment. Thus, \u201cthe\ngovernment as employer indeed has far broader powers\nthan does the government as sovereign.\u201d Waters v. Chur\u00ad\nchill, 511 U. S. 661, 671 (1994) (plurality opinion). \u201c[T]he\nextra power the government has in this area comes from\nthe nature of the government\u2019s mission as employer.\nGovernment agencies are charged by law with doing par-\nticular tasks. Agencies hire employees to help do those\n6       ENGQUIST v. OREGON DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntasks as effectively and efficiently as possible.\u201d Id., at\n674\u2013675. See also Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 150\u2013\n151 (1983) (explaining that the government has a legiti-\nmate interest \u201cin \u2018promot[ing] efficiency and integrity in\nthe discharge of official duties, and [in] maintain[ing]\nproper discipline in the public service\u2019 \u201d (quoting Ex parte\nCurtis, 106 U. S. 371, 373 (1882) (alterations in original))).\n\u201cThe government\u2019s interest in achieving its goals as effec-\ntively and efficiently as possible is elevated from a rela-\ntively subordinate interest when it acts as sovereign to a\nsignificant one when it acts as employer.\u201d Waters, supra,\nat 675 (plurality opinion). Given the \u201ccommon-sense\nrealization that government offices could not function if\nevery employment decision became a constitutional mat-\nter,\u201d Connick, supra, at 143, \u201cconstitutional review of\ngovernment employment decisions must rest on different\nprinciples than review of . . . restraints imposed by the\ngovernment as sovereign,\u201d Waters, supra, at 674 (plurality\nopinion).\n   In light of these basic principles, we have often recog-\nnized that government has significantly greater leeway in\nits dealings with citizen employees than it does when it\nbrings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at large.\nThus, for example, we have held that the Fourth Amend-\nment does not require public employers to obtain warrants\nbefore conducting a search of an employee\u2019s office.\nO\u2019Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 721\u2013722 (1987) (plural-\nity opinion). See also id., at 732 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment). Although we recognized that the \u201clegitimate\nprivacy interests of public employees in the private objects\nthey bring to the workplace may be substantial,\u201d we found\nthat \u201c[a]gainst these privacy interests . . . must be bal-\nanced the realities of the workplace, which strongly sug-\ngest that a warrant requirement would be unworkable.\u201d\nId., at 721 (plurality opinion). We have also found that\nthe Due Process Clause does not protect a public employee\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom discharge, even when such discharge was mistaken\nor unreasonable. See Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 350\n(1976) (\u201cThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment is not a guarantee against incorrect or ill-\nadvised personnel decisions\u201d).\n   Our public-employee speech cases are particularly in-\nstructive. In Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High\nSchool Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968), we\nexplained that, in analyzing a claim that a public em-\nployee was deprived of First Amendment rights by her\nemployer, we must seek \u201ca balance between the interests\nof the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon mat-\nters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an\nemployer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services\nit performs through its employees.\u201d\n   We analyzed the contours of this balance more fully in\nConnick v. Myers, supra. We explained that the First\nAmendment protects public-employee speech only when it\nfalls within the core of First Amendment protection\u2014\nspeech on matters of public concern. We recognized that\nthe \u201c \u2018First Amendment does not protect speech and as-\nsembly only to the extent it can be characterized as politi-\ncal,\u2019 \u201d and that the government therefore could not gener-\nally prohibit or punish, in its capacity as sovereign, speech\non the ground that it does not touch upon matters of pub-\nlic concern, id., at 147 (quoting Mine Workers v. Illinois\nBar Assn., 389 U. S. 217, 223 (1967)). But \u201c[w]hen em-\nployee expression cannot be fairly considered as relating to\nany matter of political, social, or other concern to the\ncommunity, government officials should enjoy wide lati-\ntude in managing their offices.\u201d Connick, 461 U. S., at\n146. As we explained, \u201cabsent the most unusual circum-\nstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum in\nwhich to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken\nby a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee\u2019s\nbehavior.\u201d Id., at 147 (citing Bishop, supra, at 349\u2013350).\n8      ENGQUIST v. OREGON DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Our precedent in the public-employee context therefore\nestablishes two main principles: First, although govern-\nment employees do not lose their constitutional rights\nwhen they accept their positions, those rights must be\nbalanced against the realities of the employment context.\nSecond, in striking the appropriate balance, we consider\nwhether the asserted employee right implicates the basic\nconcerns of the relevant constitutional provision, or\nwhether the claimed right can more readily give way to\nthe requirements of the government as employer. With\nthese principles in mind, we come to the question whether\na class-of-one theory of equal protection is cognizable in\nthe public employment context.\n                             B\n   Our equal protection jurisprudence has typically been\nconcerned with governmental classifications that \u201caffect\nsome groups of citizens differently than others.\u201d\nMcGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 425 (1961). See,\ne.g., Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, 609 (1974) (\u201c \u2018Equal\nProtection\u2019 . . . emphasizes disparity in treatment by a\nState between classes of individuals whose situations are\narguably indistinguishable\u201d); San Antonio Independent\nSchool Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 60 (1973) (Stewart,\nJ., concurring) (\u201c[T]he basic concern of the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause is with state legislation whose purpose or\neffect is to create discrete and objectively identifiable\nclasses\u201d). Plaintiffs in such cases generally allege that\nthey have been arbitrarily classified as members of an\n\u201cidentifiable group.\u201d Personnel Administrator of Mass. v.\nFeeney, 442 U. S. 256, 279 (1979).\n   Engquist correctly argues, however, that we recognized\nin Olech that an equal protection claim can in some cir-\ncumstances be sustained even if the plaintiff has not\nalleged class-based discrimination, but instead claims that\nshe has been irrationally singled out as a so-called \u201cclass\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof one.\u201d In Olech, a property owner had asked the village\nof Willowbrook to connect her property to the municipal\nwater supply. Although the village had required only a\n15-foot easement from other property owners seeking\naccess to the water supply, the village conditioned Olech\u2019s\nconnection on a grant of a 33-foot easement. Olech sued\nthe village, claiming that the village\u2019s requirement of an\neasement 18 feet longer than the norm violated the Equal\nProtection Clause. Although Olech had not alleged that\nthe village had discriminated against her based on mem-\nbership in an identifiable class, we held that her complaint\nstated a valid claim under the Equal Protection Clause\nbecause it alleged that she had \u201cbeen intentionally treated\ndifferently from others similarly situated and that there is\nno rational basis for the difference in treatment.\u201d 528\nU. S., at 564 (citing Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota\nCounty, 260 U. S. 441 (1923), and Allegheny Pittsburgh\nCoal Co. v. Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336\n(1989)).\n   Recognition of the class-of-one theory of equal protection\non the facts in Olech was not so much a departure from\nthe principle that the Equal Protection Clause is con-\ncerned with arbitrary government classification, as it was\nan application of that principle. That case involved the\ngovernment\u2019s regulation of property. Similarly, the cases\nupon which the Court in Olech relied concerned property\nassessment and taxation schemes. See Allegheny Pitts\u00ad\nburgh, supra; Sioux City Bridge, supra. We expect such\nlegislative or regulatory classifications to apply \u201cwithout\nrespect to persons,\u201d to borrow a phrase from the judicial\noath. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7453. As we explained long ago, the\nFourteenth Amendment \u201crequires that all persons sub-\njected to . . . legislation shall be treated alike, under like\ncircumstances and conditions, both in the privileges con-\nferred and in the liabilities imposed.\u201d Hayes v. Missouri,\n120 U. S. 68, 71\u201372 (1887). When those who appear simi-\n10     ENGQUIST v. OREGON DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlarly situated are nevertheless treated differently, the\nEqual Protection Clause requires at least a rational reason\nfor the difference, to assure that all persons subject to\nlegislation or regulation are indeed being \u201ctreated alike,\nunder like circumstances and conditions.\u201d Thus, when it\nappears that an individual is being singled out by the\ngovernment, the specter of arbitrary classification is fairly\nraised, and the Equal Protection Clause requires a \u201cra-\ntional basis for the difference in treatment.\u201d Olech, 528\nU. S., at 564.\n   What seems to have been significant in Olech and the\ncases on which it relied was the existence of a clear stan-\ndard against which departures, even for a single plaintiff,\ncould be readily assessed. There was no indication in\nOlech that the zoning board was exercising discretionary\nauthority based on subjective, individualized determina-\ntions\u2014at least not with regard to easement length, how-\never typical such determinations may be as a general\nzoning matter. See id., at 565 (BREYER, J., concurring in\nresult). Rather, the complaint alleged that the board\nconsistently required only a 15-foot easement, but sub-\njected Olech to a 33-foot easement. This differential\ntreatment raised a concern of arbitrary classification, and\nwe therefore required that the State provide a rational\nbasis for it.\n   In Allegheny Pittsburgh, cited by the Olech Court, the\napplicable standard was market value, but the county\ndeparted from that standard in basing some assessments\non quite dated purchase prices. Again, there was no sug-\ngestion that the \u201cdramatic differences in valuation\u201d for\nsimilar property parcels, 488 U. S., at 341, were based on\nsubjective considerations of the sort on which appraisers\noften rely, see id., at 338\u2013342, 345. Sioux City Bridge, also\ncited in Olech, was the same sort of case, recognizing an\nequal protection claim when one taxpayer\u2019s property was\nassessed at 100 percent of its value, while all other prop-\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nerty was assessed at 55 percent, without regard to articu-\nlated differences in the properties. See 260 U. S., at 445\u2013\n447.\n   There are some forms of state action, however, which by\ntheir nature involve discretionary decisionmaking based\non a vast array of subjective, individualized assessments.\nIn such cases the rule that people should be \u201ctreated alike,\nunder like circumstances and conditions\u201d is not violated\nwhen one person is treated differently from others, be-\ncause treating like individuals differently is an accepted\nconsequence of the discretion granted. In such situations,\nallowing a challenge based on the arbitrary singling out of\na particular person would undermine the very discretion\nthat such state officials are entrusted to exercise.\n   Suppose, for example, that a traffic officer is stationed\non a busy highway where people often drive above the\nspeed limit, and there is no basis upon which to distin-\nguish them. If the officer gives only one of those people a\nticket, it may be good English to say that the officer has\ncreated a class of people that did not get speeding tickets,\nand a \u201cclass of one\u201d that did. But assuming that it is in\nthe nature of the particular government activity that not\nall speeders can be stopped and ticketed, complaining that\none has been singled out for no reason does not invoke the\nfear of improper government classification. Such a com-\nplaint, rather, challenges the legitimacy of the underlying\naction itself\u2014the decision to ticket speeders under such\ncircumstances. Of course, an allegation that speeding\ntickets are given out on the basis of race or sex would state\nan equal protection claim, because such discriminatory\nclassifications implicate basic equal protection concerns.\nBut allowing an equal protection claim on the ground that\na ticket was given to one person and not others, even if for\nno discernible or articulable reason, would be incompatible\nwith the discretion inherent in the challenged action. It is\nno proper challenge to what in its nature is a subjective,\n12     ENGQUIST v. OREGON DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nindividualized decision that it was subjective and indi-\nvidualized.\n   This principle applies most clearly in the employment\ncontext, for employment decisions are quite often subjec-\ntive and individualized, resting on a wide array of factors\nthat are difficult to articulate and quantify. As Engquist\nherself points out, \u201c[u]nlike the zoning official, the public\nemployer often must take into account the individual\npersonalities and interpersonal relationships of employees\nin the workplace. The close relationship between the\nemployer and employee, and the varied needs and inter-\nests involved in the employment context, mean that con-\nsiderations such as concerns over personality conflicts that\nwould be unreasonable as grounds for \u2018arm\u2019s-length\u2019 gov-\nernment decisions (e.g., zoning, licensing) may well justify\ndifferent treatment of a public employee.\u201d Brief for Peti-\ntioner 48. Unlike the context of arm\u2019s-length regulation,\nsuch as in Olech, treating seemingly similarly situated\nindividuals differently in the employment context is par\nfor the course.\n   Thus, the class-of-one theory of equal protection\u2014which\npresupposes that like individuals should be treated alike,\nand that to treat them differently is to classify them in a\nway that must survive at least rationality review\u2014is\nsimply a poor fit in the public employment context. To\ntreat employees differently is not to classify them in a way\nthat raises equal protection concerns. Rather, it is simply\nto exercise the broad discretion that typically character-\nizes the employer-employee relationship. A challenge that\none has been treated individually in this context, instead\nof like everyone else, is a challenge to the underlying\nnature of the government action.\n   Of course, that is not to say that the Equal Protection\nClause, like other constitutional provisions, does not apply\nto public employers. Indeed, our cases make clear that the\nEqual Protection Clause is implicated when the govern-\n                  Cite as: 553 U.

The dissent\u2019s broad\nstatement that we \u201cexcep[t] state employees from the\nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection against unequal and\nirrational treatment at the hands of the State,\u201d post, at 2\n(opinion of STEVENS, J.), is thus plainly not correct. But\nwe have never found the Equal Protection Clause impli-\ncated in the specific circumstance where, as here, govern-\nment employers are alleged to have made an individual-\nized, subjective personnel decision in a seemingly\narbitrary or irrational manner.\n   This is not surprising, given the historical understand-\ning of the nature of government employment. We long ago\nrecognized the \u201csettled principle that government em-\nployment, in the absence of legislation, can be revoked at\nthe will of the appointing officer.\u201d McElroy, 367 U.

But recognition of a class-of-one theory\nof equal protection in the public employment context\u2014\nthat is, a claim that the State treated an employee differ-\nently from others for a bad reason, or for no reason at all\u2014\nis simply contrary to the concept of at-will employment.\nThe Constitution does not require repudiating that famil-\niar doctrine.\n   To be sure, Congress and all the States have, for the\nmost part, replaced at-will employment with various\nstatutory schemes protecting public employees from dis-\ncharge for impermissible reasons. See, e.g., 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a72302(b)(10) (2006 ed.)

S.,\nat 373; alterations in original). Thus, for example, al-\nthough most federal employees are covered by the Civil\nService Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95\u2013454, Congress has\nspecifically excluded some groups of employees from its\nprotection, see, e.g., 5 U. S. C. \u00a72302(a)(2)(C) (2006 ed.)\n(excluding from coverage, inter alia, the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the\nDefense Intelligence Agency). Were we to find that the\nEqual Protection Clause subjects the Government to equal\nprotection review for every allegedly arbitrary employ-\nment action, we will have undone Congress\u2019s (and the\nStates\u2019) careful work.\n   In concluding that the class-of-one theory of equal pro-\ntection has no application in the public employment con-\ntext\u2014and that is all we decide\u2014we are guided, as in the\npast, by the \u201ccommon-sense realization that government\noffices could not function if every employment decision\nbecame a constitutional matter.\u201d Connick, supra, at 143.\nIf, as Engquist suggests, plaintiffs need not claim dis-\ncrimination on the basis of membership in some class or\ngroup, but rather may argue only that they were treated\nby their employers worse than other employees similarly\nsituated, any personnel action in which a wronged em-\nployee can conjure up a claim of differential treatment will\nsuddenly become the basis for a federal constitutional\nclaim. Indeed, an allegation of arbitrary differential\ntreatment could be made in nearly every instance of an\nassertedly wrongful employment action\u2014not only hiring\nand firing decisions, but any personnel action, such as\npromotion, salary, or work assignments\u2014on the theory\nthat other employees were not treated wrongfully. See\n478 F. 3d, at 995. On Engquist\u2019s view, every one of these\nemployment decisions by a government employer would\n16      ENGQUIST v. OREGON DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbecome the basis for an equal protection complaint.\n   Engquist assures us that accepting her view would not\npose too much of a practical problem.             Specifically,\nEngquist argues that a plaintiff in a class-of-one employ-\nment case would have to prove that the government\u2019s\ndifferential treatment was intentional, that the plaintiff\nwas treated differently from other similarly situated\npersons, and that the unequal treatment was not ration-\nally related to a legitimate government purpose. Brief for\nPetitioner 36\u201339. And because a \u201cgovernmental employ-\nment decision is . . . rational whenever the discrimination\nrelates to a legitimate government interest,\u201d it is in prac-\ntice \u201cdifficult for plaintiffs to show that the government\nhas failed to meet this standard.\u201d Id., at 41. JUSTICE\nSTEVENS makes a similar argument, stating \u201cthat all but a\nhandful [of class-of-one complaints] are dismissed well in\nadvance of trial.\u201d Post, at 7.\n   We agree that, even if we accepted Engquist\u2019s claim, it\nwould be difficult for a plaintiff to show that an employ-\nment decision is arbitrary. But this submission is beside\nthe point. The practical problem with allowing class-of-\none claims to go forward in this context is not that it will\nbe too easy for plaintiffs to prevail, but that governments\nwill be forced to defend a multitude of such claims in the\nfirst place, and courts will be obliged to sort through them\nin a search for the proverbial needle in a haystack. The\nEqual Protection Clause does not require \u201c[t]his displace-\nment of managerial discretion by judicial supervision.\u201d\nGarcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.

S. C. \u00a71983.1 In prior cases, we have refused\nto craft new remedies for the violation of constitutional\nrights of federal employees, Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367\n(1983), or for the nonconstitutional claims of state employ-\nees, Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341 (1976). But refusal to\ngive effect to the congressionally mandated remedy em-\nbodied in \u00a71983 would be impermissible. To avoid this\nresult, the Court today concludes that Engquist suffered\nno constitutional violation at all, and that there was thus\nno harm to be remedied. In so holding, the Court\u2014as it\ndid in Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410 (2006)\u2014carves a\nnovel exception out of state employees\u2019 constitutional\nrights.

Even if some surgery were truly necessary to\nprevent governments from being forced to defend a multi-\ntude of equal protection \u201cclass of one\u201d claims, the Court\nshould use a scalpel rather than a meat-axe.\n                              I\n  Our decision in Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528\nU. S. 562 (2000) (per curiam), applied a rule that had been\nan accepted part of our equal protection jurisprudence for\ndecades: Unless state action that intentionally singles out\nan individual, or a class of individuals, for adverse treat-\nment is supported by some rational justification, it vio-\nlates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s command that no State\nshall \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\nprotection of the laws.\u201d\n  Our opinion in Olech emphasized that the legal issue\nwould have been the same whether the class consisted of\none or five members, because \u201cthe number of individuals\nin a class is immaterial for equal protection analysis.\u201d Id.,\nat 564, n. The outcome of that case was not determined by\nthe size of the disadvantaged class, and the majority does\nnot\u2014indeed cannot\u2014dispute the settled principle that the\nEqual Protection Clause protects persons, not groups. See\nante, at 4\u20135.\n  Nor did the outcome in Olech turn on the fact that the\nVillage was discriminating against a property owner\nrather than an employee. The majority does not dispute\nthat the strictures of the Equal Protection Clause apply to\nthe States in their role as employers as well as regulators.\nSee ante, at 5.

S. 115, 119\u2013120 (1992).\n  Rather, the outcome of Olech was dictated solely by the\nabsence of a rational basis for the discrimination. As we\nexplained:\n       \u201cOur cases have recognized successful equal protec-\n    tion claims brought by a \u2018class of one,\u2019 where the\n    plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally\n    treated differently from others similarly situated and\n    that there is no rational basis for the difference in\n    treatment. In so doing, we have explained that \u2018[t]he\n    purpose of the equal protection clause of the Four-\n    teenth Amendment is to secure every person within\n    the State\u2019s jurisdiction against intentional and arbi-\n    trary discrimination, whether occasioned by express\n    terms of a statute or by its improper execution\n    through duly constituted agents.\u2019\n    \u201c[Olech\u2019s] complaint also alleged that the Village\u2019s\n    demand was \u2018irrational and wholly arbitrary\u2019 . . . .\n    These allegations, quite apart from the Village\u2019s sub-\n    jective motivation, are sufficient to state a claim for\n    relief under traditional equal protection analysis.\u201d\n    528 U. S., at 564, 565 (some internal quotation marks\n    and citations omitted).\n   Here, as in Olech, Engquist alleged that the State\u2019s\nactions were arbitrary and irrational. In response, the\nState offered no explanation whatsoever for its decisions;\nit did not claim that Engquist was a subpar worker, or\neven that her personality made her a poor fit in the work-\nplace or that her colleagues simply did not enjoy working\nwith her. In fact, the State explicitly disclaimed the exis-\n4        ENGQUIST v. OREGON DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntence of any workplace or performance-based rationale.2\nSee, e.g., Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, 19. The jury pro-\nceeded to find that the respondents intentionally treated\nEngquist \u201cdifferently than others similarly situated with\nrespect to the . . . termination of her employment . . .\nwithout any rational basis and solely for arbitrary, vindic-\ntive or malicious reasons.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 3\u20134. The\njury\u2019s verdict thus established that there was no rational\nbasis for either treating Engquist differently from other\nemployees or for the termination of her employment. The\nState does not dispute this finding. Under our reasoning\nin Olech, the absence of any justification for the discrimi-\nnation sufficed to establish the constitutional violation.\n   The majority nonetheless concludes, based on \u201cunique\nconsiderations applicable when the government acts as\nemployer,\u201d that the \u201cclass of one\u201d theory of equal protec-\ntion is not applicable in the public employment context.\nAnte, at 5. Its conclusion is based upon speculation about\ninapt hypothetical cases, and an incorrect evaluation of\nthe importance of the government\u2019s interest in preserving\na regime of \u201cat will\u201d employment. Its reasoning is flawed\non both counts.\n                             II\n  The majority asserts that public-employment decisions\nshould be carved out of our equal protection jurisprudence\nbecause employment decisions (as opposed to, for example,\nzoning decisions) are inherently discretionary. I agree\nthat employers must be free to exercise discretionary\nauthority. But there is a clear distinction between an\nexercise of discretion and an arbitrary decision. A discre-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 But for this disclaimer, the lower court could have dismissed the\n\nclaim if it discerned \u201cany reasonably conceivable state of facts that\ncould provide a rational basis for the [State\u2019s actions],\u201d even one not put\nforth by the State. FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307,\n313 (1993). The disclaimer, however, negated that possibility.\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntionary decision represents a choice of one among two or\nmore rational alternatives. See 1 H. Hart & A. Sacks, The\nLegal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Applica-\ntion of Law 162 (Tent. ed. 1958) (defining discretion as\n\u201cthe power to choose between two or more courses of action\neach of which is thought of as permissible\u201d). The choice\nmay be mistaken or unwise without being irrational. If\nthe arguments favoring each alternative are closely bal-\nanced, the need to make a choice may justify using a coin\ntoss as a tie breaker. Moreover, the Equal Protection\nClause proscribes arbitrary decisions\u2014decisions unsup-\nported by any rational basis\u2014not unwise ones. Accord-\ningly, a discretionary decision with any \u201creasonably con-\nceivable\u201d rational justification will not support an equal\nprotection claim; only a truly arbitrary one will. There is\ntherefore no need to create an exception for the public-\nemployment context in order to prevent these discretion-\nary decisions from giving rise to equal protection claims.\n   The hypothetical situations posited by the majority do\nnot prove otherwise. The hypothetical traffic officer de-\nscribed in the Court\u2019s opinion, ante, at 11, had a rational\nbasis for giving a ticket to every speeder passing him on\nthe highway. His inability to arrest every driver in sight\nprovides an adequate justification for making a random\nchoice from a group of equally guilty and equally accessi-\nble violators. As such, the Court is quite correct in stating\nthat \u201callowing an equal protection claim on the ground\nthat a ticket was given to one person and not others, even\nif for no discernible or articulable reason, would be incom-\npatible with the discretion inherent in the challenged\naction.\u201d Ibid. If there were no justification for the arrest,\nthere would be no need to invoke the Equal Protection\nClause because the officer\u2019s conduct would violate the\nFourth Amendment. But as noted, a random choice\namong rational alternatives does not violate the Equal\nProtection Clause.\n6      ENGQUIST v. OREGON DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   A comparable hypothetical decision in the employment\ncontext (e.g., a supervisor who is required to eliminate one\nposition due to an involuntary reduction-in-force and who\nchooses to terminate one of several equally culpable em-\nployees) also differs from the instant case insofar as it\nassumes the existence of a rational basis for the individual\ndecision. The fact that a supervisor might not be able to\nexplain why he terminated one employee rather than\nanother will not give rise to an equal protection claim so\nlong as there was a rational basis for the termination itself\nand for the decision to terminate just one, rather than all,\nof the culpable employees.\n   Instead of using a scalpel to confine so-called \u201cclass of\none\u201d claims to cases involving a complete absence of any\nconceivable rational basis for the adverse action and the\ndifferential treatment of the plaintiff, the Court adopts an\nunnecessarily broad rule that tolerates arbitrary and\nirrational decisions in the employment context.\n                             III\n    The majority\u2019s decision also rests on the premise that\n\u201c[t]he Constitution does not require repudiating th[e]\nfamiliar doctrine\u201d of at-will employment. Ante, at 14. In\nthe 1890\u2019s that doctrine applied broadly to government\nemployment, see McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford, 155\nMass. 216, 29 N. E. 517 (1892), but for many years now\n\u201c \u2018the theory that public employment which may be denied\naltogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless\nof how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.\u2019 \u201d Keyi-\nshian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385\nU. S. 589, 605\u2013606 (1967). Indeed, recent constitutional\ndecisions and statutory enactments have all but nullified\nthe significance of the doctrine. See, e.g., Elrod v. Burns,\n427 U. S. 347 (1976); Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497\nU. S. 62 (1990); see also 5 U. S. C. \u00a72302(b)(10) (2006 ed.)\n(supervisor of covered federal employee may not \u201cdis-\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

Accordingly, preserv-\ning the remnants of \u201cat-will\u201d employment provides a feeble\njustification for creating a broad exception to a well-\nestablished category of constitutional protections.3\n                             IV\n   Presumably the concern that actually motivates today\u2019s\ndecision is fear that governments will be forced to defend\nagainst a multitude of \u201cclass of one\u201d claims unless the\nCourt wields its meat-axe forthwith. Experience demon-\nstrates, however, that these claims are brought infre-\nquently,4 that the vast majority of such claims are as-\nserted in complaints advancing other claims as well, and\nthat all but a handful are dismissed well in advance of\ntrial. Experience also demonstrates that there are in fact\nrare cases in which a petty tyrant has misused govern-\nmental power. Proof that such misuse was arbitrary\nbecause unsupported by any conceivable rational basis\nshould suffice to establish a violation of the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause without requiring its victim also to prove that\nthe tyrant was motivated by a particular variety of class-\nbased animus.

Metcalf, Assistant Attorney General, Salem, Oregon, for Respondents.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question in this case is whether a public employee can state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause by alleging that she was arbitrarily treated differently from other similarly situated employees, with no assertion that the different treatment was based on the employee's membership in any particular class. We hold that such a \"class-of-one\" theory of equal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2149</span> protection has no place in the public employment context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Anup Engquist, the petitioner in this case, was hired in 1992 by Norma Corristan to be an international food standard specialist for the Export Service Center (ESC), a laboratory within the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA). During the course of her employment, Engquist experienced repeated problems with Joseph Hyatt, another ODA employee, complaining to Corristan that he had made false statements about her and otherwise made her life difficult. Corristan responded by directing Hyatt to attend diversity and anger management training.</p>\n<p>In 2001, John Szczepanski, an assistant director of ODA, assumed responsibility over ESC, supervising Corristan, Hyatt, and Engquist. Szczepanski told a client that he could not \"control\" Engquist, and that Engquist and Corristan \"would be gotten rid of.\" When Engquist and Hyatt both applied for a vacant managerial post within ESC, Szczepanski chose Hyatt despite Engquist's greater experience in the relevant field. Later that year, during a round of across-the-board budget cuts in Oregon, Szczepanski eliminated Corristan's position. Finally, on January 31, 2002, Engquist was informed that her position was being eliminated because of reorganization. Engquist's collective-bargaining agreement gave her the opportunity either to \"bump\" to another position at her level, or to take a demotion. She was found unqualified for the only other position at her level and declined a demotion, and was therefore effectively laid off.</p>\n<p>Engquist subsequently brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon against ODA, Szczepanski, and Hyatt, all respondents here, alleging violations of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and state law. As to Engquist's equal protection claim, she alleged that the defendants discriminated against her on the basis of her race, sex, and national origin. She also brought what is known as a \"class-of-one\" equal protection claim, alleging that she was fired not because she was a member of an identified class (unlike her race, sex, and national origin claims), but simply for \"arbitrary, vindictive, and malicious reasons.\" App. 10.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted the respondents' motion for summary judgment as to some of Engquist's claims, but allowed others to go forward, including each of the equal protection claims. As relevant to this case, the District Court found Engquist's class-of-one equal protection claim legally viable, deciding that the class-of-one theory was fully applicable in the employment context. Civ. No. 02-1637-AS (D.Ore., Sept. 14, 2004), App. 58, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2066748</span></span>, *5. The court held that Engquist could succeed on that theory if she could prove \"that she was singled out as a result of animosity on the part of Hyatt and Szczepanski\"\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> \"that their actions were spiteful efforts to punish her for reasons unrelated to any legitimate state objective\"\u0097and if she could demonstrate, on the basis of that animosity, that \"she was treated differently than others who were similarly situated.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The jury rejected Engquist's claims of discrimination for membership in a suspect class\u0097her race, sex, and national origin claims\u0097but found in her favor on the class-of-one claim. Specifically, the jury found that Hyatt and Szczepanski \"intentionally treat[ed] [Engquist] differently than others similarly situated with respect to the denial of her promotion, termination of her employment, or denial of bumping rights without any rational basis and solely <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2150</span> for arbitrary, vindictive or malicious reasons.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4. The jury also found for Engquist on several of her other claims, and awarded her $175,000 in compensatory damages and $250,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part. It recognized that this Court had upheld a class-of-one equal protection challenge to state legislative and regulatory action in <i>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1855348\"><a href=\"/opinion/1855348/village-of-willowbrook-v-olech/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000) (<i>per curiam</i>). <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797035\"><a href=\"/opinion/797035/anup-engquist-v-oregon-department-of-agriculture-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span>, 992-993 (C.A.9 2007). The court below also acknowledged that other Circuits had applied <i>Olech</i> in the public employment context, <i>id.,</i> at 993 (citing cases), but it disagreed with those courts on the ground that our cases have routinely afforded government greater leeway when it acts as employer rather than regulator, <i>id.,</i> at 993-996. The court concluded that extending the class-of-one theory of equal protection to the public employment context would lead to undue judicial interference in state employment practices and \"completely invalidate the practice of public at-will employment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 995. The court accordingly held that the class-of-one theory is \"inapplicable to decisions made by public employers with regard to their employees.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 996.</p>\n<p>Judge Reinhardt dissented, \"agree[ing] with the other circuits that the class-of-one theory of equal protection is applicable to public employment decisions.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1010. We granted certiorari to resolve this disagreement in the lower courts, 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 977, 169 L.Ed.2d 800 (2008), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Engquist argues that the Equal Protection Clause forbids public employers from irrationally treating one employee differently from others similarly situated, regardless of whether the different treatment is based on the employee's membership in a particular class. She reasons that in <i>Olech, supra,</i> we recognized in the regulatory context a similar class-of-one theory of equal protection, Brief for Petitioner 14-15; that the Equal Protection Clause protects individuals, not classes, <i>id.,</i> at 15-17; that the Clause proscribes \"discrimination arising not only from a legislative act but also from the conduct of an administrative official,\" <i>id.,</i> at 17; and that the Constitution applies to the State not only when it acts as regulator, but also when it acts as employer, <i>id.,</i> at 23-29. Thus, Engquist concludes that class-of-one claims can be brought against public employers just as against any other state actors, <i>id.,</i> at 29-32, and that differential treatment of government employees\u0097even when not based on membership in a class or group\u0097violates the Equal Protection Clause unless supported by a rational basis, <i>id.,</i> at 32, 39-45.</p>\n<p>We do not quarrel with the premises of Engquist's argument. It is well settled that the Equal Protection Clause \"protect[s] persons, not groups,\" <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 227, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995) (emphasis omitted), and that the Clause's protections apply to administrative as well as legislative acts, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96704\"><a href=\"/opinion/96704/raymond-v-chicago-union-traction-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 35-36, 28 S.Ct. 7, 52 L.Ed. 78 (1907). It is equally well settled that States do not escape the strictures of the Equal Protection Clause in their role as employers. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>New York City Transit Authority v. Beazer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110042\"><a href=\"/opinion/110042/new-york-city-transit-authority-v-beazer/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 99 S.Ct. 1355, 59 L.Ed.2d 587 (1979); <i>Harrah Independent School Dist. v.

We do not, however, agree that Engquist's conclusion follows from these premises. Our traditional view of the core concern of the Equal Protection Clause as a shield against arbitrary classifications, combined with unique considerations applicable when the government acts as employer as opposed to sovereign, lead us to conclude that the class-of-one theory of equal protection does not apply in the public employment context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We have long held the view that there is a crucial difference, with respect to constitutional analysis, between the government exercising \"the power to regulate or license, as lawmaker,\" and the government acting \"as proprietor, to manage [its] internal operation.\" <i>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers v. McElroy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106290\"><a href=\"/opinion/106290/cafeteria-restaurant-workers-v-mcelroy/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 896, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961). This distinction has been particularly clear in our review of state action in the context of public employment. Thus, \"the government as employer indeed has far broader powers than does the government as sovereign.\" <i>Waters v. Churchill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087950\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087950/waters-v-churchill/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span>, 671, 114 S.Ct. 1878, 128 L.Ed.2d 686 (1994) (plurality opinion). \"[T]he extra power the government has in this area comes from the nature of the government's mission as employer. Government agencies are charged by law with doing particular tasks. Agencies hire employees to help do those tasks as effectively and efficiently as possible.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 674-675, 114 S.Ct. 1878. See also <i>Connick v. Myers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 150-151, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983) (explaining that the government has a legitimate interest \"in `promot[ing] efficiency and integrity in the discharge of official duties, and [in] maintain[ing] proper discipline in the public service'\" (quoting <i>Ex parte Curtis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90682\"><a href=\"/opinion/90682/ex-parte-curtis/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 373, 1 S.Ct. 381, 27 L.Ed. 232 (1882) (alterations in original))). \"The government's interest in achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as possible is elevated from a relatively subordinate interest when it acts as sovereign to a significant one when it acts as employer.\" <i>Waters, supra,</i> at 675, 114 S.Ct. 1878 (plurality opinion). Given the \"common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter,\" <i>Connick, supra,</i> at 143, 103 S.Ct. 1684, \"constitutional review of government employment decisions must rest on different principles than review of . . . restraints imposed by the government as sovereign,\" <i>Waters, supra,</i> at 674, 114 S.Ct. 1878 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>In light of these basic principles, we have often recognized that government has significantly greater leeway in its dealings with citizen employees than it does when it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at large. Thus, for example, we have held that the Fourth Amendment does not require public employers to obtain warrants before conducting a search of an employee's office. <i>O'Connor v. Ortega,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111851\"><a href=\"/opinion/111851/oconnor-v-ortega/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span>, 721-722, 107 S.Ct. 1492, 94 L.Ed.2d 714 (1987) (plurality opinion). See also <i>id.,</i> at 732, 107 S.Ct. 1492 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Although we recognized that the \"legitimate privacy interests of public employees in the private objects they bring to the workplace may be substantial,\" we found that \"[a]gainst these privacy interests . . . must be balanced the realities of the workplace, which strongly suggest that a warrant requirement would be unworkable.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 721, 107 S.Ct. 1492 (plurality opinion). We have also found that the Due Process Clause does not protect a public employee from discharge, even when such discharge was mistaken or unreasonable. See <i>Bishop v. Wood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109476\"><a href=\"/opinion/109476/bishop-v-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 350, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976) (\"The Due <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2152</span> Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not a guarantee against incorrect or ill-advised personnel decisions\").</p>\n<p>Our public-employee speech cases are particularly instructive. In <i>Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-di/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), we explained that, in analyzing a claim that a public employee was deprived of First Amendment rights by her employer, we must seek \"a balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\"</p>\n<p>We analyzed the contours of this balance more fully in <i>Connick v. Myers, supra</i><i>.</i> We explained that the First Amendment protects public-employee speech only when it falls within the core of First Amendment protection\u0097speech on matters of public concern. We recognized that the \"`First Amendment does not protect speech and assembly only to the extent it can be characterized as political,'\" and that the government therefore could not generally prohibit or punish, in its capacity as sovereign, speech on the ground that it does not touch upon matters of public concern, <i>id.,</i> at 147, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (quoting <i>Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107551\"><a href=\"/opinion/107551/mine-workers-v-illinois-bar-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span>, 223, 88 S.Ct. 353, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967)). But \"[w]hen employee expression cannot be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community, government officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices.\" <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S., at 146, 103 S.Ct. 1684. As we explained, \"absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee's behavior.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 147, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (citing <i>Bishop, supra,</i> at 349-350, 96 S.Ct. 2074).</p>\n<p>Our precedent in the public-employee context therefore establishes two main principles: First, although government employees do not lose their constitutional rights when they accept their positions, those rights must be balanced against the realities of the employment context. Second, in striking the appropriate balance, we consider whether the asserted employee right implicates the basic concerns of the relevant constitutional provision, or whether the claimed right can more readily give way to the requirements of the government as employer. With these principles in mind, we come to the question whether a class-of-one theory of equal protection is cognizable in the public employment context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Our equal protection jurisprudence has typically been concerned with governmental classifications that \"affect some groups of citizens differently than others.\" <i>McGowan v.

Although the village had required only a 15-foot easement from other property owners seeking access to the water supply, the village conditioned Olech's connection on a grant of a 33-foot easement. Olech sued the village, claiming that the village's requirement of an easement 18 feet longer than the norm violated the Equal Protection Clause. Although Olech had not alleged that the village had discriminated against her based on membership in an identifiable class, we held that her complaint stated a valid claim under the Equal Protection Clause because it alleged that she had \"been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\" 528 U.S., at 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073 (citing <i>Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100083\"><a href=\"/opinion/100083/sioux-city-bridge-co-v-dakota-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span>, 43 S.Ct. 190, 67 L.Ed. 340 (1923), and <i>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v.

That case involved the government's regulation of property. Similarly, the cases upon which the Court in <i>Olech</i> relied concerned property assessment and taxation schemes. See <i>Allegheny Pittsburgh, supra</i>; <i>Sioux City Bridge, supra</i><i>.</i> We expect such legislative or regulatory classifications to apply \"without respect to persons,\" to borrow a phrase from the judicial oath. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 453. As we explained long ago, the Fourteenth Amendment \"requires that all persons subjected to . . . legislation shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions, both in the privileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed.\" <i>Hayes v. Missouri,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91818\"><a href=\"/opinion/91818/hayes-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 71-72, 7 S.Ct. 350, 30 L.Ed. 578 (1887). When those who appear similarly situated are nevertheless treated differently, the Equal Protection Clause requires at least a rational reason for the difference, to assure that all persons subject to legislation or regulation are indeed being \"treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions.\" Thus, when it appears that an individual is being singled out by the government, the specter of arbitrary classification is fairly raised, and the Equal Protection Clause requires a \"rational basis for the difference in treatment.\" <i>Olech,</i> 528 U.S., at 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073.</p>\n<p>What seems to have been significant in <i>Olech</i> and the cases on which it relied was the existence of a clear standard against which departures, even for a single plaintiff, could be readily assessed. There was no indication in <i>Olech</i> that the zoning board was exercising discretionary authority based on subjective, individualized determinations\u0097at least not with regard to easement length, however typical such determinations may be as a general zoning matter. See <i>id.,</i> at 565, 120 S.Ct. 1073 (BREYER, J., concurring in result). Rather, the complaint alleged that the board consistently required only a 15-foot easement, but subjected Olech to a 33-foot easement. This differential treatment raised a concern of arbitrary classification, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2154</span> and we therefore required that the State provide a rational basis for it.</p>\n<p>In <i>Allegheny Pittsburgh,</i> cited by the <i>Olech</i> Court, the applicable standard was market value, but the county departed from that standard in basing some assessments on quite dated purchase prices. Again, there was no suggestion that the \"dramatic differences in valuation\" for similar property parcels, 488 U.S., at 341, 109 S.Ct. 633, were based on subjective considerations of the sort on which appraisers often rely, see <i>id.,</i> at 338-342, 345, 109 S.Ct. 633. <i>Sioux City Bridge,</i> also cited in <i>Olech,</i> was the same sort of case, recognizing an equal protection claim when one taxpayer's property was assessed at 100 percent of its value, while all other property was assessed at 55 percent, without regard to articulated differences in the properties. See 260 U.S., at 445-447, 43 S.Ct. 190.</p>\n<p>There are some forms of state action, however, which by their nature involve discretionary decisionmaking based on a vast array of subjective, individualized assessments. In such cases the rule that people should be \"treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions\" is not violated when one person is treated differently from others, because treating like individuals differently is an accepted consequence of the discretion granted. In such situations, allowing a challenge based on the arbitrary singling out of a particular person would undermine the very discretion that such state officials are entrusted to exercise.</p>\n<p>Suppose, for example, that a traffic officer is stationed on a busy highway where people often drive above the speed limit, and there is no basis upon which to distinguish them. If the officer gives only one of those people a ticket, it may be good English to say that the officer has created a class of people that did not get speeding tickets, and a \"class of one\" that did. But assuming that it is in the nature of the particular government activity that not all speeders can be stopped and ticketed, complaining that one has been singled out for no reason does not invoke the fear of improper government classification. Such a complaint, rather, challenges the legitimacy of the underlying action itself\u0097the decision to ticket speeders under such circumstances. Of course, an allegation that speeding tickets are given out on the basis of race or sex would state an equal protection claim, because such discriminatory classifications implicate basic equal protection concerns. But allowing an equal protection claim on the ground that a ticket was given to one person and not others, even if for no discernible or articulable reason, would be incompatible with the discretion inherent in the challenged action. It is no proper challenge to what in its nature is a subjective, individualized decision that it was subjective and individualized.</p>\n<p>This principle applies most clearly in the employment context, for employment decisions are quite often subjective and individualized, resting on a wide array of factors that are difficult to articulate and quantify. As Engquist herself points out, \"[u]nlike the zoning official, the public employer often must take into account the individual personalities and interpersonal relationships of employees in the workplace. The close relationship between the employer and employee, and the varied needs and interests involved in the employment context, mean that considerations such as concerns over personality conflicts that would be unreasonable as grounds for `arm's-length' government decisions (<i>e.g.,</i> zoning, licensing) may well justify different treatment of a public employee.\" Brief for Petitioner 48. Unlike the context of arm's-length regulation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2155</span> such as in <i>Olech,</i> treating seemingly similarly situated individuals differently in the employment context is par for the course.</p>\n<p>Thus, the class-of-one theory of equal protection\u0097which presupposes that like individuals should be treated alike, and that to treat them differently is to classify them in a way that must survive at least rationality review\u0097is simply a poor fit in the public employment context. To treat employees differently is not to classify them in a way that raises equal protection concerns. Rather, it is simply to exercise the broad discretion that typically characterizes the employer-employee relationship. A challenge that one has been treated individually in this context, instead of like everyone else, is a challenge to the underlying nature of the government action.</p>\n<p>Of course, that is not to say that the Equal Protection Clause, like other constitutional provisions, does not apply to public employers. Indeed, our cases make clear that the Equal Protection Clause is implicated when the government makes class-based decisions in the employment context, treating distinct groups of individuals categorically differently. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Beazer,</i> 440 U.S., at 593, 99 S.Ct. 1355 (upholding city's exclusion of methadone users from employment under rational-basis review); <i>Martin,</i> 440 U.S., at 199-201, 99 S.Ct. 1062 (classification between teachers who had complied with a continuing-education requirement and those who had not is rational and does not violate the Equal Protection Clause); <i>Murgia,</i> 427 U.S., at 314-317, 96 S.Ct. 2562 (upholding a mandatory retirement age\u0097a classification based on age\u0097under rational-basis review). The dissent's broad statement that we \"excep[t] state employees from the Fourteenth Amendment's protection against unequal and irrational treatment at the hands of the State,\" <i>post,</i> at 2158 (opinion of STEVENS, J.), is thus plainly not correct. But we have never found the Equal Protection Clause implicated in the specific circumstance where, as here, government employers are alleged to have made an individualized, subjective personnel decision in a seemingly arbitrary or irrational manner.</p>\n<p>This is not surprising, given the historical understanding of the nature of government employment. We long ago recognized the \"settled principle that government employment, in the absence of legislation, can be revoked at the will of the appointing officer.\" <i>McElroy,</i> 367 U.S., at 896, 81 S.Ct. 1743.

See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bishop, supra,</i> at 349-350, 96 S.Ct. 2074.</p>\n<p>State employers cannot, of course, take personnel actions that would independently violate the Constitution. See <i>supra,</i> at 2150-2153. But recognition of a class-of-one theory of equal protection in the public employment context\u0097that is, a claim that the State treated an employee differently from others for a bad reason, or for no reason at all\u0097is simply contrary to the concept of at-will employment. The Constitution does not require repudiating that familiar doctrine.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Congress and all the States have, for the most part, replaced at-will employment with various statutory schemes protecting public employees from discharge for impermissible reasons. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(10) (2006 ed.) (supervisor of covered federal employee may not \"discriminate . . . on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others\"). See also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 20-21. But a government's decision to limit the ability of public employers to fire at will is an act of legislative grace, not constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p>Indeed, recognizing the sort of claim Engquist presses could jeopardize the delicate balance governments have struck between the rights of public employees and \"the government's legitimate purpose in `promot[ing] efficiency and integrity in the discharge of official duties, and [in] maintain[ing] proper discipline in the public service.'\" <i>Connick, supra,</i> at 151, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (quoting <i>Ex parte Curtis,</i> 106 U.S., at 373, 1 S.Ct. 381; alterations in original). Thus, for example, although most federal employees are covered by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. 95-454, Congress has specifically excluded some groups of employees from its protection, see, <i>e.g.,</i> 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(C) (2006 ed.) (excluding from coverage, <i>inter alia,</i> the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency). Were we to find that the Equal Protection Clause subjects the Government to equal protection review for every allegedly arbitrary employment action, we will have undone Congress's (and the States') careful work.</p>\n<p>In concluding that the class-of-one theory of equal protection has no application in the public employment context\u0097and that is all we decide\u0097we are guided, as in the past, by the \"common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.\" <i>Connick, supra,</i> at 143, 103 S.Ct. 1684. If, as Engquist suggests, plaintiffs need not claim discrimination on the basis of membership in some class or group, but rather may argue only that they were treated by their employers worse than other employees similarly situated, any personnel action in which a wronged employee can conjure up a claim of differential treatment will suddenly become the basis for a federal constitutional claim. Indeed, an allegation of arbitrary differential treatment could be made in nearly every instance of an assertedly wrongful employment action\u0097not only hiring and firing decisions, but any personnel action, such as promotion, salary, or work assignments\u0097on the theory that other employees were not treated wrongfully. See 478 F.3d, at 995. On Engquist's view, every one of these employment decisions by a government employer would become the basis for an equal protection complaint.</p>\n<p>Engquist assures us that accepting her view would not pose too much of a practical problem. Specifically, Engquist argues that a plaintiff in a class-of-one employment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2157</span> case would have to prove that the government's differential treatment was intentional, that the plaintiff was treated differently from other similarly situated persons, and that the unequal treatment was not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. Brief for Petitioner 36-39. And because a \"governmental employment decision is . . . rational whenever the discrimination relates to a legitimate government interest,\" it is in practice \"difficult for plaintiffs to show that the government has failed to meet this standard.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 41. Justice STEVENS makes a similar argument, stating \"that all but a handful [of class-of-one complaints] are dismissed well in advance of trial.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2161.</p>\n<p>We agree that, even if we accepted Engquist's claim, it would be difficult for a plaintiff to show that an employment decision is arbitrary. But this submission is beside the point. The practical problem with allowing class-of-one claims to go forward in this context is not that it will be too easy for plaintiffs to prevail, but that governments will be forced to defend a multitude of such claims in the first place, and courts will be obliged to sort through them in a search for the proverbial needle in a haystack. The Equal Protection Clause does not require \"[t]his displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision.\" <i>Garcetti v.

Public employees typically have a variety of protections from just the sort of personnel actions about which Engquist complains, but the Equal Protection Clause is not one of them.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice SOUTER and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Congress has provided a judicial remedy for individuals whose federal constitutional rights are violated by state action, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<sup>[1]</sup> In prior cases, we have refused to craft <i>new</i> remedies for the violation of constitutional rights of federal employees, <i>Bush v. Lucas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110965\"><a href=\"/opinion/110965/bush-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983), or for the nonconstitutional claims of state employees, <i>Bishop v.

But refusal to give effect to the congressionally mandated remedy embodied in \u00a7 1983 would be impermissible. To avoid this result, the Court today concludes that Engquist suffered no constitutional violation at all, and that there was thus no harm to be remedied. In so holding, the Court\u0097as it did in <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006)\u0097carves a novel exception out of state employees' constitutional rights. In <i>Garcetti,</i> the Court created a new substantive rule excepting a category of speech by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2158</span> state employees from the protection of the First Amendment. Today, the Court creates a new substantive rule excepting state employees from the Fourteenth Amendment's protection against unequal and irrational treatment at the hands of the State. Even if some surgery were truly necessary to prevent governments from being forced to defend a multitude of equal protection \"class of one\" claims, the Court should use a scalpel rather than a meat-axe.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1855348\"><a href=\"/opinion/1855348/village-of-willowbrook-v-olech/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> applied a rule that had been an accepted part of our equal protection jurisprudence for decades: Unless state action that intentionally singles out an individual, or a class of individuals, for adverse treatment is supported by some rational justification, it violates the Fourteenth Amendment's command that no State shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"</p>\n<p>Our opinion in <i>Olech</i> emphasized that the legal issue would have been the same whether the class consisted of one or five members, because \"the number of individuals in a class is immaterial for equal protection analysis.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, n. The outcome of that case was not determined by the size of the disadvantaged class, and the majority does not\u0097 indeed cannot\u0097dispute the settled principle that the Equal Protection Clause protects persons, not groups. See <i>ante,</i> at 2150-2151.</p>\n<p>Nor did the outcome in <i>Olech</i> turn on the fact that the Village was discriminating against a property owner rather than an employee. The majority does not dispute that the strictures of the Equal Protection Clause apply to the States in their role as employers as well as regulators. See <i>ante,</i> at 2151. And indeed, we have made clear that \"the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and other provisions of the Federal Constitution afford protection to employees who serve the government as well as to those who are served by them, and \u00a7 1983 provides a cause of action for all citizens injured by an abridgment of those protections.\" <i>Collins v. Harker Heights,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112699\"><a href=\"/opinion/112699/collins-v-harker-heights/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 119-120, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992).</p>\n<p>Rather, the outcome of <i>Olech</i> was dictated solely by the absence of a rational basis for the discrimination. As we explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Our cases have recognized successful equal protection claims brought by a `class of one,' where the plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment. In so doing, we have explained that `[t]he purpose of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is to secure every person within the State's jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination, whether occasioned by express terms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[Olech's] complaint also alleged that the Village's demand was `irrational and wholly arbitrary' . . . . These allegations, quite apart from the Village's subjective motivation, are sufficient to state a claim for relief under traditional equal protection analysis.\" 528 U.S., at 564, 565, 120 S.Ct. 1073 (some internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Here, as in <i>Olech,</i> Engquist alleged that the State's actions were arbitrary and irrational. In response, the State offered no explanation whatsoever for its decisions; it did not claim that Engquist was a subpar worker, or even that her personality made <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2159</span> her a poor fit in the workplace or that her colleagues simply did not enjoy working with her. In fact, the State explicitly <i>disclaimed</i> the existence of any workplace or performance-based rationale.<sup>[2]</sup> See, <i>e.g.,</i> Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, 19. The jury proceeded to find that the respondents intentionally treated Engquist \"differently than others similarly situated with respect to the . . . termination of her employment. . . without any rational basis and solely for arbitrary, vindictive or malicious reasons.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4. The jury's verdict thus established that there was no rational basis for either treating Engquist differently from other employees or for the termination of her employment. The State does not dispute this finding. Under our reasoning in <i>Olech,</i> the absence of any justification for the discrimination sufficed to establish the constitutional violation.</p>\n<p>The majority nonetheless concludes, based on \"unique considerations applicable when the government acts as employer,\" that the \"class of one\" theory of equal protection is not applicable in the public employment context. <i>Ante,</i> at 2151. Its conclusion is based upon speculation about inapt hypothetical cases, and an incorrect evaluation of the importance of the government's interest in preserving a regime of \"at will\" employment. Its reasoning is flawed on both counts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The majority asserts that public-employment decisions should be carved out of our equal protection jurisprudence because employment decisions (as opposed to, for example, zoning decisions) are inherently discretionary. I agree that employers must be free to exercise discretionary authority. But there is a clear distinction between an exercise of discretion and an arbitrary decision. A discretionary decision represents a choice of one among two or more rational alternatives. See 1 H. Hart &amp; A. Sacks, The Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law 162 (Tent. ed.1958) (defining discretion as \"the power to choose between two or more courses of action each of which is thought of as permissible\"). The choice may be mistaken or unwise without being irrational. If the arguments favoring each alternative are closely balanced, the need to make a choice may justify using a coin toss as a tie breaker. Moreover, the Equal Protection Clause proscribes arbitrary decisions\u0097decisions unsupported by any rational basis\u0097not unwise ones. Accordingly, a discretionary decision with any \"reasonably conceivable\" rational justification will not support an equal protection claim; only a truly arbitrary one will. There is therefore no need to create an exception for the public-employment context in order to prevent these discretionary decisions from giving rise equal protection claims.</p>\n<p>The hypothetical situations posited by the majority do not prove otherwise. The hypothetical traffic officer described in the Court's opinion, <i>ante,</i> at 2154, had a rational basis for giving a ticket to <i>every</i> speeder passing him on the highway. His inability to arrest every driver in sight provides an adequate justification for making a random choice from a group of equally guilty and equally accessible violators. As such, the Court is quite correct in stating that \"allowing an equal protection claim on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2160</span> ground that a ticket was given to one person and not others, even if for no discernible or articulable reason, would be incompatible with the discretion inherent in the challenged action.\" <i>Ibid.</i> If there were no justification for the arrest, there would be no need to invoke the Equal Protection Clause because the officer's conduct would violate the Fourth Amendment. But as noted, a random choice among rational alternatives does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p>A comparable hypothetical decision in the employment context (<i>e.g.,</i> a supervisor who is required to eliminate one position due to an involuntary reduction-in-force and who chooses to terminate one of several equally culpable employees) also differs from the instant case insofar as it assumes the existence of a rational basis for the individual decision. The fact that a supervisor might not be able to explain why he terminated one employee rather than another will not give rise to an equal protection claim so long as there was a rational basis for the termination itself and for the decision to terminate just one, rather than all, of the culpable employees.</p>\n<p>Instead of using a scalpel to confine so-called \"class of one\" claims to cases involving a complete absence of any conceivable rational basis for the adverse action and the differential treatment of the plaintiff, the Court adopts an unnecessarily broad rule that tolerates arbitrary and irrational decisions in the employment context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The majority's decision also rests on the premise that \"[t]he Constitution does not require repudiating th[e] familiar doctrine\" of at-will employment. <i>Ante,</i> at 2156. In the 1890's that doctrine applied broadly to government employment, see <i>McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></span> (1892), but for many years now \"`the theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.'\" <i>Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></span>, 605-606, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967). Indeed, recent constitutional decisions and statutory enactments have all but nullified the significance of the doctrine. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); <i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112472\"><a href=\"/opinion/112472/rutan-v-republican-party-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990); see also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(10) (2006 ed.) (supervisor of covered federal employee may not \"discriminate . . . on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others\"). Accordingly, preserving the remnants of \"at-will\" employment provides a feeble justification for creating a broad exception to a well-established category of constitutional protections.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Presumably the concern that actually motivates today's decision is fear that governments will be forced to defend against a multitude of \"class of one\" claims unless the Court wields its meat-axe forthwith. Experience demonstrates, however, that these claims are brought infrequently,<sup>[4]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2161</span> that the vast majority of such claims are asserted in complaints advancing other claims as well, and that all but a handful are dismissed well in advance of trial. Experience also demonstrates that there are in fact rare cases in which a petty tyrant has misused governmental power. Proof that such misuse was arbitrary because unsupported by any conceivable rational basis should suffice to establish a violation of the Equal Protection Clause without requiring its victim also to prove that the tyrant was motivated by a particular variety of class-based animus. When the allegations of a complaint plainly identify \"the proverbial needle in a haystack,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2157, a federal court should not misconstrue the Constitution in order to make it even easier to dismiss unmeritorious claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>In sum, there is no compelling reason to carve arbitrary public-employment decisions out of the well-established category of equal protection violations when the familiar rational review standard can sufficiently limit these claims to only wholly unjustified employment actions. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 1983 provides that \"[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.. . .\"</p>\n<p>[2]  But for this disclaimer, the lower court could have dismissed the claim if it discerned \"any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the [State's actions],\" even one not put forth by the State. <i>FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112870\"><a href=\"/opinion/112870/fcc-v-beach-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 313, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993). The disclaimer, however, negated that possibility.</p>\n<p>[3]  Moreover, equal protection scrutiny is not incompatible with at-will employment since courts applying rational-basis scrutiny are able to rely on any <i>conceivable</i> reason for government action, and the government therefore need not explain its actual reason for terminating or disciplining the employee.</p>\n<p>[4]  Prior to the Ninth Circuit's decision this case, \"class of one\" claims arising in the public-employment context were permitted by every court that was presented with one. Yet there have been only approximately 150 cases\u0097both in the district courts and the courts of appeals\u0097addressing such claims since <i>Olech.</i></p>\n\n</div>",
