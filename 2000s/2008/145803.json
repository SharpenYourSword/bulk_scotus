Petitioner argues that his conviction cannot stand because, while the evidence demonstrates that he took steps to hide illicit funds <i>en route</i> to Mexico, it does not show that the cross-border transport of those funds was designed to create the appearance of legitimate wealth. Although we agree with the Government that the statute does not require proof that the defendant attempted to \"legitimize\" tainted funds, we agree with petitioner that the Government must demonstrate that the defendant did more than merely hide the money during its transport. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On July 14, 2004, petitioner Humberto Fidel Regalado Cuellar was stopped in southern Texas for driving erratically. Driving south toward the Mexican border, about 114 miles away, petitioner had just passed the town of Eldorado. In response to the officer's questions, petitioner, who spoke no English, handed the officer a stack of papers. Included were bus tickets showing travel from a Texas border town to San Antonio on July 13 and, in the other direction, from San Antonio to Big Spring, Texas, on July 14. A Spanish-speaking officer, Trooper Danny Nu\u00f1ez, was called to the scene and began questioning petitioner. Trooper Nu\u00f1ez soon became suspicious because petitioner was avoiding eye contact and seemed very nervous. Petitioner claimed to be on a 3-day business trip, but he had no luggage or extra clothing with him, and he gave conflicting accounts of his itinerary. When <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1998</span> Trooper Nu\u00f1ez asked petitioner about a bulge in his shirt pocket, petitioner produced a wad of cash that smelled of marijuana.</p>\n<p>Petitioner consented to a search of the Volkswagen Beetle that he was driving. While the officers were searching the vehicle, Trooper Nu\u00f1ez observed petitioner standing on the side of the road making the sign of the cross, which he interpreted to mean that petitioner knew he was in trouble. A drug detection dog alerted on the cash from petitioner's shirt pocket and on the rear area of the car. Further scrutiny uncovered a secret compartment under the rear floorboard, and inside the compartment the officers found approximately $81,000 in cash. The money was bundled in plastic bags and duct tape, and animal hair was spread in the rear of the vehicle. Petitioner claimed that he had previously transported goats in the vehicle, but Trooper Nu\u00f1ez doubted that goats could fit in such a small space and suspected that the hair had been spread in an attempt to mask the smell of marijuana.</p>\n<p>There were signs that the compartment had been recently created and that someone had attempted to cover up the bodywork: The Beetle's carpeting appeared newer than the rest of the interior, and the exterior of the vehicle appeared to have been purposely splashed with mud to cover up toolmarks, fresh paint, or other work. In the backseat, officers found a fast-food restaurant receipt dated the same day from a city farther north than petitioner claimed to have traveled. After a check of petitioner's last border crossing also proved inconsistent with his story, petitioner was arrested and interrogated. He continued to tell conflicting stories about his travels. At one point, before he knew that the officers had found the cash, he remarked to Trooper Nu\u00f1ez that he had to have the car in Mexico by midnight or else his family would be \"floating down the river.\" App. 50.</p>\n<p>Petitioner was charged with attempting to transport the proceeds of unlawful activity across the border, knowing that the transportation was designed \"to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\" of the money. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i). After a 2-day trial, the jury found petitioner guilty. The District Court denied petitioner's motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence and sentenced petitioner to 78 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p>On appeal, a divided panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed and rendered a judgment of acquittal. 441 F.3d 329 (2006). Judge Smith's majority opinion held that, although the evidence showed that petitioner concealed the money for the purpose of transporting it, the statute requires that the purpose of the transportation itself must be to conceal or disguise the unlawful proceeds. <i>Id.,</i> at 333-334. Analogizing from cases interpreting another provision of the money laundering statute, the court held that the transportation must be undertaken in an attempt to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.<sup>[1]</sup> See <i>id.,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1999</span> 334. Although the evidence showed intent to avoid detection while driving the funds to Mexico, it did not show that petitioner intended to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, and accordingly no rational trier of fact could have found petitioner guilty. <i>Ibid.</i> Judge Davis dissented, arguing that concealment during transportation is sufficient to violate \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i). <i>Id.,</i> at 334-336.</p>\n<p>The Fifth Circuit granted rehearing en banc and affirmed petitioner's conviction. 478 F.3d 282 (2007). The court rejected as inconsistent with the statutory text petitioner's argument that the Government must prove that he attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth. <i>Id.,</i> at 290. But it held that petitioner's extensive efforts to prevent detection of the funds during transportation showed that petitioner sought to conceal or disguise the nature, location, and source, ownership, or control of the funds. <i>Id.,</i> at 289-290. Judge Smith dissented for largely the same reasons set forth in his opinion for the original panel majority. He emphasized the distinction between \"concealing something to transport it, and transporting something to conceal it,\" and explained that whether petitioner was doing the latter depended on whether his ultimate plan upon reaching his destination was to conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the money. <i>Id.,</i> at 296-297.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 436, 169 L.Ed.2d 304 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, prohibits specified transfers of money derived from unlawful activities. Subsection (a)(1) makes it unlawful to engage in certain financial transactions, while subsection (a)(2) criminalizes certain kinds of transportation. Petitioner was charged under the transportation provision: The indictment alleged that he attempted to transport illicit proceeds across the Mexican border \"knowing that such transportation was designed in whole or in part to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, and control\" of the funds.<sup>[2]</sup> App. 10-11 (citing \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2000</span> A</h2>\n<p>We first consider the \"designed ... to conceal\" element. Petitioner argues that to satisfy this element, the Government must prove that the defendant attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth. Petitioner would replace \"designed... to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds\" with \"designed to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.\" \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i). This is consistent with the plain meaning of \"money laundering,\" petitioner argues, because that term is commonly understood to mean disguising illegally obtained money in order to make it appear legitimate. In petitioner's view, this common understanding of \"money laundering\" is implicit in both the transaction and transportation provisions of the statute because concealing or disguising any of the listed attributes would necessarily have the effect of making the funds appear legitimate, and, conversely, revealing any such attribute would necessarily reveal the funds as illicit. The Government disagrees, contending that making funds appear legitimate is merely one way to accomplish money laundering, and that revealing a listed attribute would not necessarily reveal the funds' illicit nature. In any event, the Government argues, the statute should not be cabined to target only classic money laundering because Congress intended to reach any conduct that impairs the ability of law enforcement to find and recover the unlawful proceeds.</p>\n<p>We agree with petitioner that taking steps to make funds appear legitimate is the common meaning of the term \"money laundering.\" See American Heritage Dictionary 992 (4th ed.2000) (hereinafter Am. Hert.) (defining \"launder\" as \"[t]o disguise the source or nature of (illegal funds, for example) by channeling through an intermediate agent\"); Black's Law Dictionary 1027 (8th ed.2004) (hereinafter Black's) (defining \"money-laundering\" to mean \"[t]he act of transferring illegally obtained money through legitimate people or accounts so that its original source cannot be traced\"). But to the extent they are inconsistent, we must be guided by the words of the operative statutory provision, and not by the common meaning of the statute's title. See <i>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey,</i> 524 U.S. 206, 212, 118 S.Ct. 1952, 141 L.Ed.2d 215 (1998) (declining to use a statute's title to limit the meaning of the text). Here, Congress used broad language that captures more than classic money laundering: In addition to concealing or disguising the nature or source of illegal funds, Congress also sought to reach transportation designed to conceal or disguise the location, ownership, or control of the funds. For example, a defendant who smuggles cash into Mexico with the intent of hiding it from authorities by burying it in the desert may have engaged in transportation designed to conceal the location of those funds, but his conduct would not necessarily have the effect of making the funds appear legitimate.</p>\n<p>Nor do we find persuasive petitioner's attempt to infuse a \"classic money laundering\" requirement into the listed attributes. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2001</span> Contrary to petitioner's argument, revealing those attributes\u0097nature, location, source, ownership, or control\u0097would not necessarily expose the illegitimacy of the funds. Digging up the cash buried in the Mexican desert, for example, would not necessarily reveal that it was derived from unlawful activity. Indeed, of all the listed attributes, only \"nature\" is coextensive with the funds' illegitimate character: Exposing the nature of illicit funds would, by definition, reveal them as unlawful proceeds. But nature is only one attribute in the statute; that it may be coextensive with the creation of the appearance of legitimate wealth does not mean that Congress intended that requirement to swallow the other listed attributes.</p>\n<p>We likewise are skeptical of petitioner's argument that violating the elements of the statute would necessarily have the effect of making the funds appear more legitimate than they did before. It is true that concealing or disguising any one of the listed attributes may have the effect of making the funds appear more legitimate\u0097largely because concealing or disguising those attributes might impede law enforcement's ability to identify illegitimate funds\u0097but we are not convinced that this is necessarily so. It might be possible for a defendant to conceal or disguise a listed attribute without also creating the appearance of legitimate wealth. Cf. <i>United States v. Abbell,</i> 271 F.3d 1286, 1298 (C.A.11 2001) (noting that the transaction provision, although designed to punish those who \"attemp[t] to legitimize their proceeds,\" may be satisfied without proof that a particular defendant did so). Petitioner's \"appearance of legitimate wealth\" requirement simply has no basis in the operative provision's text.</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that the money laundering transportation provision must be aimed at something other than merely secretive transportation of illicit funds because that conduct is already punished by the bulk cash smuggling statute, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332 (2000 ed., Supp. V). We disagree. A comparison of the statutory language reveals that, even if no \"appearance of legitimate wealth\" requirement exists in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), the two statutes nonetheless target distinct conduct. The bulk cash smuggling provision encompasses, in relevant part, a defendant who,</p>\n<blockquote>\"with the intent to evade a currency reporting requirement under section 5316, knowingly conceals more than $10,000 in currency or other monetary instruments ... and transports or transfers or attempts to transport or transfer such currency or monetary instruments from a place within the United States to a place outside of the United States.\" 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332(a)(1).</blockquote>\n<p>To be sure, certain conduct may fall within both statutes. For example, both provisions may be violated by a defendant who intends to evade a relevant reporting requirement. See \u00a7 5332(a)(1) (transportation of funds \"with the intent to evade a currency reporting requirement\"); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(ii) (transportation of funds knowing that it is designed \"to avoid a transaction reporting requirement\"). But only the money laundering statute may be violated in the absence of such intent. See \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i) (prohibiting transportation of illicit funds knowing that the transportation is designed to conceal or disguise a listed attribute). Similarly, although both statutes encompass transportation of illicit funds, only the bulk cash smuggling statute also punishes the mere transportation of lawfully derived proceeds.<sup>[3]</sup> Compare 31 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2002</span> U.S.C. \u00a7 5332(a) (omitting any requirement that the funds be unlawfully derived) with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B) (requiring that the defendant \"kno[w] that the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation ... represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Having concluded that the statute contains no \"appearance of legitimate wealth\" requirement, we next consider whether the evidence that petitioner concealed the money during transportation is sufficient to sustain his conviction. As noted, petitioner was convicted under \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), which, in relevant part, makes it a crime to attempt to transport \"funds from a place in the United States to... a place outside the United States ... knowing that the ... funds involved in the transportation ... represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and knowing that such transportation ... is designed in whole or in part ... to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.\" Accordingly, the Government was required in this case to prove that petitioner (1) attempted to transport funds from the United States to Mexico, (2) knew that these funds \"represent[ed] the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,\" <i>e.g.,</i> drug trafficking, and (3) knew that \"such transportation\" was designed to \"conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\" of the funds.</p>\n<p>It is the last of these that is at issue before us, viz., whether petitioner knew that \"such transportation\" was designed to conceal or disguise the specified attributes of the illegally obtained funds. In this connection, it is important to keep in mind that the critical transportation was not the transportation of the funds within this country on the way to the border. Instead, the term \"such transportation\" means transportation \"from a place in the United States to ... a place outside the United States\"\u0097here, from the United States to Mexico. Therefore, what the Government had to prove was that petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico was \"designed,\" at least in part, to conceal or disguise their \"nature,\" \"location,\" \"source,\" \"ownership,\" or \"control.\"</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain his conviction because concealing or disguising a listed attribute of the funds during transportation cannot satisfy the \"designed ... to conceal\" element. Citing cases that interpret the identical phrase in the transaction provision to exclude \"mere spending,\"<sup>[4]</sup> petitioner argues that the transportation provision must exclude \"mere hiding.\" Otherwise, petitioner contends, all cross-border transport of illicit funds would fall under the statute because people regularly make minimal efforts to conceal money, such as placing it inside a wallet or other receptacle, in order to secure it during travel. The Government responds that concealment during transportation is sufficient to satisfy this element because it is circumstantial evidence that the ultimate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2003</span> purpose of the transportation\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> its \"design\"\u0097is to conceal or disguise a listed attribute of the funds. This standard would not criminalize all cross-border transport of illicit funds, the Government argues, because, just as in the transaction cases,<sup>[5]</sup> the statute encompasses only <i>substantial</i> efforts at concealment. As a result, the Government agrees with the Court of Appeals that a violation of the transportation provision cannot be established solely by evidence that the defendant carried money in a wallet or concealed it in some other conventional or incidental way. See 478 F.3d, at 291 (characterizing the defendant's transportation of money in a box in <i>United States v. Dimeck,</i> 24 F.3d 1239, 1246 (C.A.10 1994), as a \"minimal attempt at concealment\" that is distinguishable from petitioner's \"effort to hide or conceal\" the funds).</p>\n<p>We agree with petitioner that merely hiding funds during transportation is not sufficient to violate the statute, even if substantial efforts have been expended to conceal the money. Our conclusion turns on the text of \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), and particularly on the term \"design.\" In this context, \"design\" means purpose or plan; <i>i.e.,</i> the intended aim of the transportation. See Am. Hert. 491 (\"To formulate a plan for; devise\"; \"[t]o create or contrive for a particular purpose or effect\"); Black's 478 (\"A plan or scheme\"; \"[p]urpose or intention combined with a plan\"); see also Brief for United States 14 (\"`to conceive and plan out in the mind'\" (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 611 (1993))). Congress wrote \"knowing that such transportation is designed ... to conceal or disguise\" a listed attribute of the funds, \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), and when an act is \"designed to\" do something, the most natural reading is that it has that something as its purpose. The Fifth Circuit employed this meaning of design when it referred to the \"transportation design or plan to get the funds out of this country.\" See 478 F.3d, at 289.</p>\n<p>But the Fifth Circuit went on to discuss the \"design\" of the transportation in a different sense. It described the packaging of the money, its placement in the hidden compartment, and the use of animal hair to mask its scent as \"<i>aspects</i> of the transportation\" that \"were designed to conceal or disguise\" the nature and location of the cash. <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Because the Fifth Circuit used \"design\" to refer not to the purpose of the transportation but to the manner in which it was carried out, its use of the term in this context was consistent with the alternate meaning of \"design\" as structure or arrangement. See Am. Hert. 491, 492 (\"To plan out in systematic, usually graphic form\"; \"[t]he purposeful or inventive arrangement of parts or details\"); Black's 478 (\"The pattern or configuration of elements in something, such as a work of art\"). The Government at times also appears to adopt this meaning of \"design.\" See Brief for United States 21 (\"Congress focused on how the transportation itself was `designed'\"); <i>id.,</i> at 43 (arguing that petitioner's design to move funds without detection is proof of a design to conceal or disguise the location and nature of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2004</span> funds).<sup>[6]</sup> If the statutory term had this meaning, it would apply whenever a person transported illicit funds in a secretive manner. Judge Smith supplied an example of this construction: A petty thief who hides money in his shoe and then walks across the border to spend the money in local bars, see 478 F.3d, at 301 (dissenting opinion), has engaged in transportation designed to conceal the location of the money because he has hidden it in an unlikely place.</p>\n<p>We think it implausible, however, that Congress intended this meaning of \"design.\" If it had, it could have expressed its intention simply by writing \"knowing that such transportation conceals or disguises,\" rather than the more complex formulation \"knowing that such transportation... is designed ... to conceal or disguise.\" \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i). It seems far more likely that Congress intended courts to apply the familiar criminal law concepts of purpose and intent than to focus exclusively on how a defendant \"structured\" the transportation. In addition, the structural meaning of \"design\" is both overinclusive and underinclusive: It would capture individuals who structured transportation in a secretive way but lacked any criminal intent (such as a person who hid illicit funds <i>en route</i> to turn them over to law enforcement); yet it would exclude individuals who fully intended to move the funds in order to impede detection by law enforcement but failed to hide them during the transportation.</p>\n<p>To be sure, purpose and structure are often related. One may employ structure to achieve a purpose: For example, the petty thief may hide money in his shoe to prevent it from being detected as he crosses the border with the intent to hide the money in Mexico. See 478 F.3d, at 301 (Smith, J., dissenting). Although transporting money in a conventional manner may suggest no particular purpose other than simply to move it from one place to another, secretively transporting it suggests, at least, that the defendant did not want the money to be detected during transport. In this case, evidence of the methods petitioner used to transport the nearly $81,000 in cash\u0097bundled in plastic bags and hidden in a secret compartment covered with animal hair\u0097was plainly probative of an underlying goal to prevent the funds from being detected while he drove them from the United States to Mexico. The same secretive aspects of the transportation also may be circumstantial evidence that the transportation itself was intended to avoid detection of the funds, because, for example, they may suggest that the transportation is only one step in a larger plan to facilitate the cross-border transport of the funds. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 289 (noting that \"concealment of the funds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2005</span> during the U.S. leg of the trip [was] a vital part of the transportation design or plan to get the funds out of this country\"). But its probative force, in that context, is weak. \"There is a difference between concealing something to transport it, and transporting something to conceal it,\" <i>id.,</i> at 296-297 (Smith, J., dissenting); that is, <i>how</i> one moves the money is distinct from <i>why</i> one moves the money. Evidence of the former, standing alone, is not sufficient to prove the latter.</p>\n<p>This case illustrates why: Even with abundant evidence that petitioner had concealed the money in order to transport it, the Government's own expert witness\u0097 ICE Agent Richard Nuckles\u0097testified that the purpose of the transportation was to compensate the leaders of the operation.<sup>[7]</sup> Tr. 179 (Oct. 12, 2004), App. 64-65 (\"[T]he bulk of [the money] generally goes back to Mexico, because the smuggler is the one who originated this entire process. He's going to get a large cut of the profit, and that money has to be moved back to him in Mexico\"). The evidence suggested that the secretive aspects of the transportation were employed to <i>facilitate</i> the transportation, see 478 F.3d, at 289 (noting that \"concealment of the funds during the U.S. leg of the trip [was] a vital part of the transportation design or plan\"), but not necessarily that secrecy was the <i>purpose</i> of the transportation. Agent Nuckles testified that the secretive manner of transportation was consistent with drug smuggling, see Tr. 179-180, App. 65-66, but the Government failed to introduce any evidence that the reason drug smugglers move money to Mexico is to conceal or disguise a listed attribute of the funds.</p>\n<p>Agent Nuckles also testified that Acuna, the Mexican border town to which petitioner was headed, has a cash economy and that U.S. currency is widely accepted there. See Tr. 188-189, App. 69. The Fifth Circuit apparently viewed this as evidence that petitioner transported the money in order to conceal or disguise it: \"[G]iven Mexico's largely cash economy, if [petitioner] had successfully transported the funds to Mexico without detection, the jury was entitled to find that the funds would have been better concealed or concealable after the transportation than before.\" 478 F.3d, at 292. The statutory text makes clear, however, that a conviction under this provision requires proof that the purpose\u0097not merely effect\u0097of the transportation was to conceal or disguise a listed attribute. Although the evidence suggested that petitioner's transportation would have had the effect of concealing the funds, the evidence did not demonstrate that such concealment was the purpose of the transportation because, for instance, there was no evidence that petitioner knew about or intended the effect.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2006</span> In sum, we conclude that the evidence introduced by the Government was not sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner's transportation was \"designed in whole or in part ... to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds.\" \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The provision of the money laundering statute under which petitioner was convicted requires proof that the transportation was \"designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\" of the funds. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i). Although this element does not require proof that the defendant attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, neither can it be satisfied solely by evidence that a defendant concealed the funds during their transport. In this case, the only evidence introduced to prove this element showed that petitioner engaged in extensive efforts to conceal the funds <i>en route</i> to Mexico, and thus his conviction cannot stand. We reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice KENNEDY join, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court but write briefly to summarize my understanding of the deficiency in the Government's proof.</p>\n<p>As the Court notes, <i>ante,</i> at 2002, the Government was required in this case to prove that petitioner knew that the plan to transport the funds across the Mexican border was designed at least in part to \"conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\" of the funds. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>Transporting the funds across the border would have had the <i>effect</i> of achieving this objective if, once the funds made it into Mexico, it would have been harder for law enforcement authorities in this country (1) to ascertain that the funds were drug proceeds (\"nature\"), (2) to find the funds (\"location\"), (3) to determine where they came from (\"source\"), (4) to ascertain who owned them (\"ownership\"), or (5) to find out who controlled them (\"control\"). But as the Court notes, <i>ante,</i> at 2005, the prosecution had to prove, not simply that the transportation of the funds from the United States to Mexico would have had one of these <i>effects, ibid.,</i> but that petitioner <i>knew</i> that achieving one of these effects was a <i>design</i> (<i>i.e.,</i> purpose) of the transportation.</p>\n<p>As the Court also notes, <i>ante,</i> at 2005, n. 8, a criminal defendant's intent is often inferred. Here, proof of petitioner's knowledge and of the intent of the person or persons who \"designed\" the transportation would have been sufficient if the prosecution had introduced evidence showing, not only that taking \"dirty\" money across the border has one or more of the effects noted above, but that it is commonly known in the relevant circles (that is, among those who design and carry out \"such transportation,\" \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)) that taking \"dirty\" money to Mexico has one of the effects noted above. Such evidence would permit a trier of fact to infer (1) that the person or persons who \"designed\" the plan to have the funds taken to Mexico intended to achieve the effect in question and (2) that a person like petitioner (that is, a person who is recruited to transport the funds) knew that this was the design.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2007</span> Of course, if the prosecution had introduced such evidence, the defense could have countered with any available proof showing (1) that in fact the achievement of these effects was not a design of the transportation or (2) that petitioner in fact did not know that achieving one of these effects was a purpose of the plan. It would have then been up to the trier of fact to decide whether the statutory elements had been adequately proven.</p>\n<p>At petitioner's trial, as the Court notes, <i>ante,</i> at 2005, the Government introduced some evidence regarding the effect of transporting illegally obtained money to Mexico, but the Government has not pointed to any evidence in the record from which it could be inferred beyond a reasonable doubt that a person like petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico would have had one of the relevant effects. For this reason, I agree with the Court that petitioner's conviction cannot be sustained.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Several Courts of Appeals have considered this requirement as relevant, or even necessary, in the context of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), which prohibits, <i>inter alia,</i> engaging in financial transactions \"involv[ing] the proceeds of specified unlawful activity ... knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part ... to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of some specified unlawful activity.\" See <i>United States v. Morales-Rodriguez,</i> 467 F.3d 1, 13 (C.A.1 2006); <i>United States v. Esterman,</i> 324 F.3d 565, 572-573 (C.A.7 2003); <i>United States v.

Dimeck,</i> 24 F.3d 1239, 1247 (C.A.10 1994).\n</p>\n<p>In construing the provision under which petitioner was convicted, four Courts of Appeals, including the Fifth Circuit, have implicitly or explicitly rejected the requirement. See <i>United States v. Garcia-Jaimes,</i> 484 F.3d 1311, 1322 (C.A.11 2007) (upholding convictions for conspiracy to commit transportation money laundering without addressing the requirement); <i>United States v. Ness,</i> 466 F.3d 79, 81-82 (C.A.2 2006) (rejecting the requirement and upholding a conviction for conspiracy to violate the transportation provision where defendant's conduct was elaborate and highly secretive); <i>United States v. Carr,</i> 25 F.3d 1194, 1206-1207 (C.A.3 1994) (upholding a conviction under the transportation provision without discussing the requirement).</p>\n<p>[2]  Subsection (a)(2) reads, in its entirety:\n</p>\n<p>\"Whoever transports, transmits, or transfers, or attempts to transport, transmit, or transfer a monetary instrument or funds from a place in the United States to or through a place outside the United States or to a place in the United States from or through a place outside the United States\u0097</p>\n<p>\"(A) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity; or</p>\n<p>\"(B) knowing that the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation, transmission, or transfer represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and knowing that such transportation, transmission, or transfer is designed in whole or in part\u0097</p>\n<p>\"(i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or</p>\n<p>\"(ii) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law,</p>\n<p>\"shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the value of the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation, transmission, or transfer whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both. For the purpose of the offense described in subparagraph (B), the defendant's knowledge may be established by proof that a law enforcement officer represented the matter specified in subparagraph (B) as true, and the defendant's subsequent statements or actions indicate that the defendant believed such representations to be true.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  Section 1956(a)(2)(A) also punishes the mere transportation of lawfully derived proceeds, but it imposes the additional requirement, not found in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332 (2000 ed., Supp. V), that the defendant must have \"inten[ded] to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Esterman,</i> 324 F.3d, at 570-572; <i>United States v. Corchado-Peralta,</i> 318 F.3d 255, 259 (C.A.1 2003); <i>McGahee,</i> 257 F.3d, at 527; <i>United States v. Herron,</i> 97 F.3d 234, 237 (C.A.8 1996); <i>United States v. Majors,</i> 196 F.3d 1206, 1213 (C.A.11 1999); <i>United States v. Stephenson,</i> 183 F.3d 110, 120-121 (C.A.2 1999); <i>Dobbs,</i> 63 F.3d, at 398; <i>United States v. Garcia-Emanuel,</i> 14 F.3d 1469, 1474 (C.A.10 1994).</p>\n<p>[5]  See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ness,</i> 466 F.3d, at 81 (concluding that extensive attempts at secrecy were sufficient to support a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1), but \"express[ing] no view\" as to whether transactions involving \"less elaborate stratagems or a lesser measure of secrecy\" would be sufficient); <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 440 F.3d 1286, 1291 (C.A.11 2006) (\"Evidence of concealment must be substantial\"); <i>Dimeck,</i> 24 F.3d, at 1247 (\"The transportation of the money from Detroit to California in a box, suitcase, or other container does not convert the mere transportation of money into money laundering\").</p>\n<p>[6]  This understanding of \"design\" is also implicit in some of the Government's statements that secretive transportation is sufficient to prove a violation of the statute. See Brief for United States 46 (arguing that the statute covers any \"surreptitiou[s]\" movement of funds \"to a location where United States law enforcement authorities are impaired from detecting and intercepting them,\" apparently regardless of whether such impairment was the purpose of the plan); <i>id.,</i> at 11 (\"When a defendant surreptitiously transports or attempts to transport illegal proceeds across the border knowing of their illegal character, money laundering is the appropriate charge\"); <i>id.,</i> at 13 (\"The statute explicitly covers, and was intended to cover, a wide range of conduct that impairs the ability of law enforcement to find and recover the proceeds of crime\"); Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. Agent Richard Nuckles, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), appears to have adopted this standard at trial as well. See Tr. 196 (Oct. 12, 2004) (testifying that attempting to move funds across the border without detection would be illegal, apparently regardless of the reason for doing so).</p>\n<p>[7]  Concealing or disguising a listed attribute need be only one of the purposes of the transportation. See \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i) (providing that a transportation plan need be designed \"in whole or in part\" to conceal or disguise). But here, compensating the leaders of the operation was the only purpose to which Agent Nuckles testified.</p>\n<p>[8]  In many cases, a criminal defendant's knowledge or purpose is not established by direct evidence but instead is shown circumstantially based on inferences drawn from evidence of effect. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 5.2(a), p. 341 (2d ed.2003). Specifically, where the consequences of an action are commonly known, a trier of fact will often infer that the person taking the action knew what the consequences would be and acted with the purpose of bringing them about. Although, as noted above, the Government introduced some evidence regarding the effect of transporting illegally obtained money to Mexico, the Government has not pointed to any evidence in the record from which it could be inferred beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico would have had one of the relevant effects.</p>\n\n</div>",

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 06\u20131456. Argued February 25, 2008\u2014Decided June 2, 2008\nArrested after a search of the car he was driving through Texas toward\n  Mexico revealed nearly $81,000 bundled in plastic bags and covered\n  with animal hair in a secret compartment under the rear floorboard,\n  petitioner was charged with, and convicted of, attempting to trans-\n  port \u201cfunds from a place in the United States to . . . a place outside\n  the United States . . . knowing that the . . . funds . . . represent the\n  proceeds of . . . unlawful activity and . . . that such transportation . . .\n  is designed . . . to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the\n  source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of \u201d the money,\n  in violation of the federal money laundering statute, 18 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i). Affirming, the Fifth Circuit rejected as inconsistent\n  with the statutory text petitioner\u2019s argument that the Government\n  must prove that he attempted to create the appearance of legitimate\n  wealth, but held that his extensive efforts to prevent the funds\u2019 detec-\n  tion during transportation showed that he sought to conceal or dis-\n  guise their nature, location, source, ownership, or control.\nHeld: Although \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i) does not require proof that the defen-\n dant attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, neither\n can it be satisfied solely by evidence that the funds were concealed\n during transport. The statutory text makes clear that a conviction\n requires proof that the transportation\u2019s purpose\u2014not merely its ef-\n fect\u2014was to conceal or disguise one of the listed attributes: the funds\u2019\n nature, location, source, ownership, or control. Pp. 5\u201317.\n    (a) The statute contains no \u201cappearance of legitimate wealth\u201d re-\n quirement. Although petitioner is correct that taking steps to make\n funds appear legitimate is the common meaning of \u201cmoney launder-\n ing,\u201d this Court must be guided by a statute\u2019s words, not by its title\u2019s\n common meaning, to the extent they are inconsistent, see Pennsyl-\n2              REGALADO CUELLAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    vania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212. Here, Con-\n    gress used broad language that captures more than classic money\n    laundering: In addition to concealing or disguising the nature or\n    source of illegal funds, Congress also sought to reach transportation\n    designed to conceal or disguise the funds\u2019 location, ownership, or con-\n    trol. Nor does the Court find persuasive petitioner\u2019s attempt to in-\n    fuse a money-laundering requirement into the listed attributes. Only\n    the attribute \u201cnature\u201d is coextensive with the funds\u2019 illegitimate\n    character, but that does not mean that Congress intended nature to\n    swallow the other attributes. The Court is likewise skeptical of peti-\n    tioner\u2019s argument that violating the statute\u2019s elements would neces-\n    sarily have the effect of making the funds appear more legitimate\n    than they did before. It is not necessarily true that concealing or dis-\n    guising any one of the listed attributes may have the effect of making\n    the funds appear more legitimate by impeding law enforcement\u2019s\n    ability to identify illegitimate funds. Finally, the Court disagrees\n    with petitioner\u2019s argument that \u00a71956(a)(2) must be aimed at some-\n    thing other than merely secretive transportation of illicit funds be-\n    cause that conduct is already punished by the bulk cash smuggling\n    statute, 31 U. S. C. \u00a75332. Even if \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i) has no \u201cappear-\n    ance of legitimate wealth\u201d requirement, the two statutes nonetheless\n    target distinct conduct, in that \u00a75332(a)(1) encompasses, inter alios, a\n    defendant who, \u201cwith the intent to evade a currency reporting re-\n    quirement . . . , knowingly conceals more than $10,000 . . . and trans-\n    ports [it] from . . . the United States to a place outside\u201d the country.\n    Pp. 6\u20139.\n       (b) The evidence that petitioner concealed the money during trans-\n    portation is not sufficient to sustain his conviction. In determining\n    whether he knew that \u201csuch transportation,\u201d \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i), was\n    designed to conceal or disguise the specified attributes of the illegally\n    obtained funds, the critical transportation was not the transportation\n    of the funds within this country on the way to the border, but trans-\n    portation \u201cfrom a place in the United States to . . . a place outside the\n    United States,\u201d ibid.\u2014here, from this country to Mexico. Therefore,\n    what the Government had to prove was that petitioner knew that\n    taking the funds to Mexico was \u201cdesigned,\u201d at least in part, to conceal\n    or disguise their \u201cnature,\u201d \u201clocation,\u201d \u201csource,\u201d \u201cownership,\u201d or \u201ccon-\n    trol.\u201d The Court agrees with petitioner that merely hiding funds dur-\n    ing transportation is not sufficient to violate the statute, even if sub-\n    stantial efforts have been expended to conceal the money. This\n    conclusion turns on \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s text, particularly the term \u201cde-\n    sign,\u201d which the dictionaries show means purpose or plan; i.e., the\n    transportation\u2019s intended aim. Congress wrote \u201cknowing that such\n    transportation is designed . . . to conceal or disguise\u201d a listed attrib-\n                       Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                         3\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n  ute, and when an act is \u201cdesigned to\u201d do something, the most natural\n  reading is that it has that something as its purpose. Because the\n  Fifth Circuit used \u201cdesign\u201d to refer not to the transportation\u2019s pur-\n  pose but to the manner in which it was carried out, its use of the\n  term in this context was consistent with the alternate meaning of\n  \u201cdesign\u201d as structure or arrangement. It is implausible, however,\n  that Congress intended this meaning. If it had, it could have ex-\n  pressed its intention simply by writing \u201cknowing that such transpor-\n  tation conceals or disguises,\u201d rather than the more complex formula-\n  tion \u201cknowing that such transportation . . . is designed . . . to conceal\n  or disguise.\u201d \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i). It seems far more likely that Con-\n  gress intended courts to apply the familiar criminal law concepts of\n  purpose and intent than to focus exclusively on how a defendant\n  \u201cstructured\u201d the transportation. In addition, the structural meaning\n  of \u201cdesign\u201d is both overinclusive and underinclusive: It would capture\n  individuals who structured transportation in a secretive way but\n  lacked any criminal intent (such as a person who hid illicit funds en\n  route to turn them over to law enforcement); yet it would exclude in-\n  dividuals who fully intended to move the funds in order to impede de-\n  tection by law enforcement but failed to hide them during transport.\n      In this case, evidence that petitioner transported the cash bundled\n  in plastic bags and hidden in a secret compartment covered with\n  animal hair was plainly probative of an underlying goal to prevent\n  the funds\u2019 detection during the drive into Mexico. However, even\n  with the abundant evidence that petitioner had concealed the money\n  in order to transport it, the Government\u2019s own expert testified that\n  the transportation\u2019s purpose was to compensate the Mexican leaders\n  of the operation. Thus, the evidence suggested that the transporta-\n  tion\u2019s secretive aspects were employed to facilitate it, but not neces-\n  sarily that secrecy was its purpose. Because petitioner\u2019s extensive ef-\n  forts to conceal the funds en route to Mexico was the only evidence\n  the Government introduced to prove that the transportation was \u201cde-\n  signed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the [funds\u2019] nature,\n  . . . location, . . . source, . . . ownership, or . . . control,\u201d petitioner\u2019s\n  conviction cannot stand.

Petitioner\nargues that his conviction cannot stand because, while the\nevidence demonstrates that he took steps to hide illicit\nfunds en route to Mexico, it does not show that the cross-\nborder transport of those funds was designed to create the\nappearance of legitimate wealth. Although we agree with\nthe Government that the statute does not require proof\nthat the defendant attempted to \u201clegitimize\u201d tainted\nfunds, we agree with petitioner that the Government must\ndemonstrate that the defendant did more than merely\nhide the money during its transport. We therefore reverse\nthe judgment of the Fifth Circuit.\n                            I\n  On July 14, 2004, petitioner Humberto Fidel Regalado\nCuellar was stopped in southern Texas for driving errati\u00ad\ncally. Driving south toward the Mexican border, about\n114 miles away, petitioner had just passed the town of\nEldorado. In response to the officer\u2019s questions, petitioner,\n2          REGALADO CUELLAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwho spoke no English, handed the officer a stack of pa\u00ad\npers. Included were bus tickets showing travel from a\nTexas border town to San Antonio on July 13 and, in the\nother direction, from San Antonio to Big Spring, Texas, on\nJuly 14. A Spanish-speaking officer, Trooper Danny Nu\u00ad\n\u00f1ez, was called to the scene and began questioning peti\u00ad\ntioner. Trooper Nu\u00f1ez soon became suspicious because\npetitioner was avoiding eye contact and seemed very\nnervous. Petitioner claimed to be on a 3-day business trip,\nbut he had no luggage or extra clothing with him, and he\ngave conflicting accounts of his itinerary. When Trooper\nNu\u00f1ez asked petitioner about a bulge in his shirt pocket,\npetitioner produced a wad of cash that smelled of\nmarijuana.\n   Petitioner consented to a search of the Volkswagen\nBeetle that he was driving. While the officers were\nsearching the vehicle, Trooper Nu\u00f1ez observed petitioner\nstanding on the side of the road making the sign of the\ncross, which he interpreted to mean that petitioner knew\nhe was in trouble. A drug detection dog alerted on the\ncash from petitioner\u2019s shirt pocket and on the rear area of\nthe car. Further scrutiny uncovered a secret compartment\nunder the rear floorboard, and inside the compartment the\nofficers found approximately $81,000 in cash. The money\nwas bundled in plastic bags and duct tape, and animal\nhair was spread in the rear of the vehicle. Petitioner\nclaimed that he had previously transported goats in the\nvehicle, but Trooper Nu\u00f1ez doubted that goats could fit in\nsuch a small space and suspected that the hair had been\nspread in an attempt to mask the smell of marijuana.\n   There were signs that the compartment had been re\u00ad\ncently created and that someone had attempted to cover\nup the bodywork: The Beetle\u2019s carpeting appeared newer\nthan the rest of the interior, and the exterior of the vehicle\nappeared to have been purposely splashed with mud to\ncover up toolmarks, fresh paint, or other work.

After a check of peti\u00ad\ntioner\u2019s last border crossing also proved inconsistent with\nhis story, petitioner was arrested and interrogated. He\ncontinued to tell conflicting stories about his travels. At\none point, before he knew that the officers had found the\ncash, he remarked to Trooper Nu\u00f1ez that he had to have\nthe car in Mexico by midnight or else his family would be\n\u201cfloating down the river.\u201d App. 50.\n   Petitioner was charged with attempting to transport the\nproceeds of unlawful activity across the border, knowing\nthat the transportation was designed \u201cto conceal or dis\u00ad\nguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership,\nor the control\u201d of the money. 18 U. S. C. \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i).\nAfter a 2-day trial, the jury found petitioner guilty. The\nDistrict Court denied petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment of\nacquittal based on insufficient evidence and sentenced\npetitioner to 78 months in prison, followed by three years\nof supervised release.\n   On appeal, a divided panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed\nand rendered a judgment of acquittal. 441 F. 3d 329\n(2006). Judge Smith\u2019s majority opinion held that, al\u00ad\nthough the evidence showed that petitioner concealed the\nmoney for the purpose of transporting it, the statute re\u00ad\nquires that the purpose of the transportation itself must\nbe to conceal or disguise the unlawful proceeds. Id., at\n333\u2013334. Analogizing from cases interpreting another\nprovision of the money laundering statute, the court held\nthat the transportation must be undertaken in an attempt\nto create the appearance of legitimate wealth.1 See id., at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Several Courts of Appeals have considered this requirement as\n\nrelevant, or even necessary, in the context of 18 U. S.

Although the evidence showed intent to avoid detec\u00ad\ntion while driving the funds to Mexico, it did not show that\npetitioner intended to create the appearance of legitimate\nwealth, and accordingly no rational trier of fact could have\nfound petitioner guilty. Ibid. Judge Davis dissented,\narguing that concealment during transportation is suffi\u00ad\ncient to violate \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i).

C.\n\u00a71956, prohibits specified transfers of money derived from\nunlawful activities. Subsection (a)(1) makes it unlawful to\nengage in certain financial transactions, while subsection\n(a)(2) criminalizes certain kinds of transportation. Peti\u00ad\ntioner was charged under the transportation provision:\nThe indictment alleged that he attempted to transport\nillicit proceeds across the Mexican border \u201cknowing that\nsuch transportation was designed in whole or in part to\nconceal and disguise the nature, location, source, owner\u00ad\nship, and control\u201d of the funds.2 App. 10\u201311 (citing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Subsection (a)(2) reads, in its entirety:\n\n\u201cWhoever transports, transmits, or transfers, or attempts to transport,\ntransmit, or transfer a monetary instrument or funds from a place in\nthe United States to or through a place outside the United States or to\na place in the United States from or through a place outside the United\nStates\u2014\n   \u201c(A) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful\nactivity; or\n   \u201c(B) knowing that the monetary instrument or funds involved in the\ntransportation, transmission, or transfer represent the proceeds of\nsome form of unlawful activity and knowing that such transportation,\ntransmission, or transfer is designed in whole or in part\u2014\n   \u201c(i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the\nownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity;\nor\n   \u201c(ii) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or\nFederal law,\n\u201cshall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the\nvalue of the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transporta\u00ad\n6            REGALADO CUELLAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i)).\n                             A\n   We first consider the \u201cdesigned . . . to conceal\u201d element.\nPetitioner argues that to satisfy this element, the Gov\u00ad\nernment must prove that the defendant attempted to\ncreate the appearance of legitimate wealth. Petitioner\nwould replace \u201cdesigned . . . to conceal or disguise the\nnature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the\ncontrol of the proceeds\u201d with \u201cdesigned to create the ap\u00ad\npearance of legitimate wealth.\u201d \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i). This is\nconsistent with the plain meaning of \u201cmoney laundering,\u201d\npetitioner argues, because that term is commonly under\u00ad\nstood to mean disguising illegally obtained money in order\nto make it appear legitimate. In petitioner\u2019s view, this\ncommon understanding of \u201cmoney laundering\u201d is implicit\nin both the transaction and transportation provisions of\nthe statute because concealing or disguising any of the\nlisted attributes would necessarily have the effect of mak\u00ad\ning the funds appear legitimate, and, conversely, revealing\nany such attribute would necessarily reveal the funds as\nillicit. The Government disagrees, contending that mak\u00ad\ning funds appear legitimate is merely one way to accom\u00ad\nplish money laundering, and that revealing a listed at\u00ad\ntribute would not necessarily reveal the funds\u2019 illicit\nnature. In any event, the Government argues, the statute\nshould not be cabined to target only classic money laun\u00ad\ndering because Congress intended to reach any conduct\nthat impairs the ability of law enforcement to find and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntion, transmission, or transfer whichever is greater, or imprisonment\nfor not more than twenty years, or both. For the purpose of the offense\ndescribed in subparagraph (B), the defendant\u2019s knowledge may be\nestablished by proof that a law enforcement officer represented the\nmatter specified in subparagraph (B) as true, and the defendant\u2019s\nsubsequent statements or actions indicate that the defendant believed\nsuch representations to be true.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrecover the unlawful proceeds.\n   We agree with petitioner that taking steps to make\nfunds appear legitimate is the common meaning of the\nterm \u201cmoney laundering.\u201d See American Heritage Dic\u00ad\ntionary 992 (4th ed. 2000) (hereinafter Am. Hert.) (defin\u00ad\ning \u201claunder\u201d as \u201c[t]o disguise the source or nature of\n(illegal funds, for example) by channeling through an\nintermediate agent\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1027 (8th ed.\n2004) (hereinafter Black\u2019s) (defining \u201cmoney-laundering\u201d\nto mean \u201c[t]he act of transferring illegally obtained money\nthrough legitimate people or accounts so that its original\nsource cannot be traced\u201d). But to the extent they are\ninconsistent, we must be guided by the words of the opera\u00ad\ntive statutory provision, and not by the common meaning\nof the statute\u2019s title. See Pennsylvania Dept. of Correc-\ntions v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212 (1998) (declining to use\na statute\u2019s title to limit the meaning of the text). Here,\nCongress used broad language that captures more than\nclassic money laundering: In addition to concealing or\ndisguising the nature or source of illegal funds, Congress\nalso sought to reach transportation designed to conceal or\ndisguise the location, ownership, or control of the funds.\nFor example, a defendant who smuggles cash into Mexico\nwith the intent of hiding it from authorities by burying it\nin the desert may have engaged in transportation de\u00ad\nsigned to conceal the location of those funds, but his con\u00ad\nduct would not necessarily have the effect of making the\nfunds appear legitimate.\n   Nor do we find persuasive petitioner\u2019s attempt to infuse\na \u201cclassic money laundering\u201d requirement into the listed\nattributes. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument, revealing\nthose attributes\u2014nature, location, source, ownership, or\ncontrol\u2014would not necessarily expose the illegitimacy of\nthe funds. Digging up the cash buried in the Mexican\ndesert, for example, would not necessarily reveal that it\nwas derived from unlawful activity. Indeed, of all the\n8          REGALADO CUELLAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlisted attributes, only \u201cnature\u201d is coextensive with the\nfunds\u2019 illegitimate character: Exposing the nature of illicit\nfunds would, by definition, reveal them as unlawful pro\u00ad\nceeds. But nature is only one attribute in the statute; that\nit may be coextensive with the creation of the appearance\nof legitimate wealth does not mean that Congress\nintended that requirement to swallow the other listed\nattributes.\n   We likewise are skeptical of petitioner\u2019s argument that\nviolating the elements of the statute would necessarily\nhave the effect of making the funds appear more legiti\u00ad\nmate than they did before. It is true that concealing or\ndisguising any one of the listed attributes may have the\neffect of making the funds appear more legitimate\u2014\nlargely because concealing or disguising those attributes\nmight impede law enforcement\u2019s ability to identify ille\u00ad\ngitimate funds\u2014but we are not convinced that this is\nnecessarily so. It might be possible for a defendant to\nconceal or disguise a listed attribute without also creating\nthe appearance of legitimate wealth. Cf. United States v.\nAbbell, 271 F. 3d 1286, 1298 (CA11 2001) (noting that the\ntransaction provision, although designed to punish those\nwho \u201cattemp[t] to legitimize their proceeds,\u201d may be satis\u00ad\nfied without proof that a particular defendant did so).\nPetitioner\u2019s \u201cappearance of legitimate wealth\u201d requirement\nsimply has no basis in the operative provision\u2019s text.\n   Petitioner argues that the money laundering transpor\u00ad\ntation provision must be aimed at something other than\nmerely secretive transportation of illicit funds because\nthat conduct is already punished by the bulk cash smug\u00ad\ngling statute, 31 U. S. C. \u00a75332 (2000 ed., Supp. V). We\ndisagree. A comparison of the statutory language reveals\nthat, even if no \u201cappearance of legitimate wealth\u201d re\u00ad\nquirement exists in 18 U. S. C. \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i), the two\nstatutes nonetheless target distinct conduct. The bulk\ncash smuggling provision encompasses, in relevant part, a\n                    Cite as: 553 U.

S. C.\n     \u00a75332(a)(1).\nTo be sure, certain conduct may fall within both statutes.\nFor example, both provisions may be violated by a defen\u00ad\ndant who intends to evade a relevant reporting require\u00ad\nment. See \u00a75332(a)(1) (transportation of funds \u201cwith the\nintent to evade a currency reporting requirement\u201d); 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(ii) (transportation of funds know\u00ad\ning that it is designed \u201cto avoid a transaction reporting\nrequirement\u201d). But only the money laundering statute\nmay be violated in the absence of such intent. See\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i) (prohibiting transportation of illicit funds\nknowing that the transportation is designed to conceal or\ndisguise a listed attribute). Similarly, although both\nstatutes encompass transportation of illicit funds, only the\nbulk cash smuggling statute also punishes the mere\ntransportation of lawfully derived proceeds.3 Compare 31\nU. S. C. \u00a75332(a) (omitting any requirement that the funds\nbe unlawfully derived) with 18 U. S. C. \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)\n(requiring that the defendant \u201ckno[w] that the monetary\ninstrument or funds involved in the transportation . . .\nrepresent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity\u201d).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Section 1956(a)(2)(A) also punishes the mere transportation of\n\nlawfully derived proceeds, but it imposes the additional requirement,\nnot found in 31 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   Having concluded that the statute contains no \u201cappear\u00ad\nance of legitimate wealth\u201d requirement, we next consider\nwhether the evidence that petitioner concealed the money\nduring transportation is sufficient to sustain his convic\u00ad\ntion.      As noted, petitioner was convicted under\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i), which, in relevant part, makes it a crime\nto attempt to transport \u201cfunds from a place in the United\nStates to . . . a place outside the United States . . . know\u00ad\ning that the . . . funds involved in the transportation . . .\nrepresent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity\nand knowing that such transportation . . . is designed in\nwhole or in part . . . to conceal or disguise the nature, the\nlocation, the source, the ownership, or the control of the\nproceeds of specified unlawful activity.\u201d Accordingly, the\nGovernment was required in this case to prove that peti\u00ad\ntioner (1) attempted to transport funds from the United\nStates to Mexico, (2) knew that these funds \u201crepresent[ed]\nthe proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,\u201d e.g., drug\ntrafficking, and (3) knew that \u201csuch transportation\u201d was\ndesigned to \u201cconceal or disguise the nature, the location,\nthe source, the ownership, or the control\u201d of the funds.\n   It is the last of these that is at issue before us, viz.,\nwhether petitioner knew that \u201csuch transportation\u201d was\ndesigned to conceal or disguise the specified attributes of\nthe illegally obtained funds. In this connection, it is im\u00ad\nportant to keep in mind that the critical transportation\nwas not the transportation of the funds within this coun\u00ad\ntry on the way to the border. Instead, the term \u201csuch\ntransportation\u201d means transportation \u201cfrom a place in the\nUnited States to . . . a place outside the United States\u201d\u2014\nhere, from the United States to Mexico. Therefore, what\nthe Government had to prove was that petitioner knew\nthat taking the funds to Mexico was \u201cdesigned,\u201d at least in\npart, to conceal or disguise their \u201cnature,\u201d \u201clocation,\u201d\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

Citing cases\nthat interpret the identical phrase in the transaction\nprovision to exclude \u201cmere spending,\u201d4 petitioner argues\nthat the transportation provision must exclude \u201cmere\nhiding.\u201d Otherwise, petitioner contends, all cross-border\ntransport of illicit funds would fall under the statute\nbecause people regularly make minimal efforts to conceal\nmoney, such as placing it inside a wallet or other recepta\u00ad\ncle, in order to secure it during travel. The Government\nresponds that concealment during transportation is suffi\u00ad\ncient to satisfy this element because it is circumstantial\nevidence that the ultimate purpose of the transportation\u2014\ni.e., its \u201cdesign\u201d\u2014is to conceal or disguise a listed attribute\nof the funds. This standard would not criminalize all\ncross-border transport of illicit funds, the Government\nargues, because, just as in the transaction cases,5 the\nstatute encompasses only substantial efforts at conceal\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See, e.g., Esterman, 324 F. 3d, at 570\u2013572; United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment. As a result, the Government agrees with the Court\nof Appeals that a violation of the transportation provision\ncannot be established solely by evidence that the defen\u00ad\ndant carried money in a wallet or concealed it in some\nother conventional or incidental way. See 478 F. 3d, at\n291 (characterizing the defendant\u2019s transportation of\nmoney in a box in United States v. Dimeck, 24 F. 3d 1239,\n1246 (CA10 1994), as a \u201cminimal attempt at concealment\u201d\nthat is distinguishable from petitioner\u2019s \u201ceffort to hide or\nconceal\u201d the funds).\n   We agree with petitioner that merely hiding funds\nduring transportation is not sufficient to violate the stat\u00ad\nute, even if substantial efforts have been expended to\nconceal the money. Our conclusion turns on the text of\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i), and particularly on the term \u201cdesign.\u201d In\nthis context, \u201cdesign\u201d means purpose or plan; i.e., the\nintended aim of the transportation. See Am. Hert. 491\n(\u201cTo formulate a plan for; devise\u201d; \u201c[t]o create or contrive\nfor a particular purpose or effect\u201d); Black\u2019s 478 (\u201cA plan or\nscheme\u201d; \u201c[p]urpose or intention combined with a plan\u201d);\nsee also Brief for United States 14 (\u201c \u2018to conceive and plan\nout in the mind\u2019 \u201d (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New Interna\u00ad\ntional Dictionary 611 (1993)). Congress wrote \u201cknowing\nthat such transportation is designed . . . to conceal or\ndisguise\u201d a listed attribute of the funds, \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i),\nand when an act is \u201cdesigned to\u201d do something, the most\nnatural reading is that it has that something as its pur\u00ad\npose. The Fifth Circuit employed this meaning of design\nwhen it referred to the \u201ctransportation design or plan to\nget the funds out of this country.\u201d See 478 F. 3d, at 289.\n   But the Fifth Circuit went on to discuss the \u201cdesign\u201d of\nthe transportation in a different sense. It described the\npackaging of the money, its placement in the hidden com\u00ad\npartment, and the use of animal hair to mask its scent as\n\u201caspects of the transportation\u201d that \u201cwere designed to\nconceal or disguise\u201d the nature and location of the cash.\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nIbid. (emphasis added). Because the Fifth Circuit used\n\u201cdesign\u201d to refer not to the purpose of the transportation\nbut to the manner in which it was carried out, its use of\nthe term in this context was consistent with the alternate\nmeaning of \u201cdesign\u201d as structure or arrangement. See Am.\nHert. 491, 492 (\u201cTo plan out in systematic, usually graphic\nform\u201d; \u201c[t]he purposeful or inventive arrangement of parts\nor details\u201d); Black\u2019s 478 (\u201cThe pattern or configuration of\nelements in something, such as a work of art\u201d). The Gov\u00ad\nernment at times also appears to adopt this meaning of\n\u201cdesign.\u201d See Brief for United States 21 (\u201cCongress fo\u00ad\ncused on how the transportation itself was \u2018designed\u2019 \u201d);\nid., at 43 (arguing that petitioner\u2019s design to move funds\nwithout detection is proof of a design to conceal or disguise\nthe location and nature of the funds).6 If the statutory\nterm had this meaning, it would apply whenever a person\ntransported illicit funds in a secretive manner. Judge\nSmith supplied an example of this construction: A petty\nthief who hides money in his shoe and then walks across\nthe border to spend the money in local bars, see 478 F. 3d,\nat 301 (dissenting opinion), has engaged in transportation\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 This understanding of \u201cdesign\u201d is also implicit in some of the Gov\u00ad\n\nernment\u2019s statements that secretive transportation is sufficient to\nprove a violation of the statute. See Brief for United States 46 (arguing\nthat the statute covers any \u201csurreptitiou[s]\u201d movement of funds \u201cto a\nlocation where United States law enforcement authorities are impaired\nfrom detecting and intercepting them,\u201d apparently regardless of\nwhether such impairment was the purpose of the plan); id., at 11\n(\u201cWhen a defendant surreptitiously transports or attempts to transport\nillegal proceeds across the border knowing of their illegal character,\nmoney laundering is the appropriate charge\u201d); id., at 13 (\u201cThe statute\nexplicitly covers, and was intended to cover, a wide range of conduct\nthat impairs the ability of law enforcement to find and recover the\nproceeds of crime\u201d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. Agent Richard Nuckles, Immi\u00ad\ngration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), appears to have adopted this\nstandard at trial as well.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndesigned to conceal the location of the money because he\nhas hidden it in an unlikely place.\n   We think it implausible, however, that Congress in\u00ad\ntended this meaning of \u201cdesign.\u201d If it had, it could have\nexpressed its intention simply by writing \u201cknowing that\nsuch transportation conceals or disguises,\u201d rather than the\nmore complex formulation \u201cknowing that such transporta\u00ad\ntion . . . is designed . . . to conceal or disguise.\u201d\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i). It seems far more likely that Congress\nintended courts to apply the familiar criminal law con\u00ad\ncepts of purpose and intent than to focus exclusively on\nhow a defendant \u201cstructured\u201d the transportation. In addi\u00ad\ntion, the structural meaning of \u201cdesign\u201d is both overinclu\u00ad\nsive and underinclusive: It would capture individuals who\nstructured transportation in a secretive way but lacked\nany criminal intent (such as a person who hid illicit funds\nen route to turn them over to law enforcement); yet it\nwould exclude individuals who fully intended to move the\nfunds in order to impede detection by law enforcement but\nfailed to hide them during the transportation.\n   To be sure, purpose and structure are often related.\nOne may employ structure to achieve a purpose: For ex\u00ad\nample, the petty thief may hide money in his shoe to\nprevent it from being detected as he crosses the border\nwith the intent to hide the money in Mexico. See 478 F.\n3d, at 301 (Smith, J., dissenting). Although transporting\nmoney in a conventional manner may suggest no particu\u00ad\nlar purpose other than simply to move it from one place to\nanother, secretively transporting it suggests, at least, that\nthe defendant did not want the money to be detected\nduring transport. In this case, evidence of the methods\npetitioner used to transport the nearly $81,000 in cash\u2014\nbundled in plastic bags and hidden in a secret compart\u00ad\nment covered with animal hair\u2014was plainly probative of\nan underlying goal to prevent the funds from being de\u00ad\ntected while he drove them from the United States to\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nMexico. The same secretive aspects of the transportation\nalso may be circumstantial evidence that the transporta\u00ad\ntion itself was intended to avoid detection of the funds,\nbecause, for example, they may suggest that the transpor\u00ad\ntation is only one step in a larger plan to facilitate the\ncross-border transport of the funds. Cf. id., at 289 (noting\nthat \u201cconcealment of the funds during the U. S. leg of the\ntrip [was] a vital part of the transportation design or plan\nto get the funds out of this country\u201d). But its probative\nforce, in that context, is weak. \u201cThere is a difference\nbetween concealing something to transport it, and trans\u00ad\nporting something to conceal it,\u201d id., at 296\u2013297 (Smith, J.,\ndissenting); that is, how one moves the money is distinct\nfrom why one moves the money. Evidence of the former,\nstanding alone, is not sufficient to prove the latter.\n   This case illustrates why: Even with abundant evidence\nthat petitioner had concealed the money in order to trans\u00ad\nport it, the Government\u2019s own expert witness\u2014ICE Agent\nRichard Nuckles\u2014testified that the purpose of the trans\u00ad\nportation was to compensate the leaders of the operation.7\nTr. 179 (Oct. 12, 2004), App. 64\u201365 (\u201c[T]he bulk of [the\nmoney] generally goes back to Mexico, because the smug\u00ad\ngler is the one who originated this entire process. He\u2019s\ngoing to get a large cut of the profit, and that money has to\nbe moved back to him in Mexico\u201d). The evidence suggested\nthat the secretive aspects of the transportation were em\u00ad\nployed to facilitate the transportation, see 478 F. 3d, at\n289 (noting that \u201cconcealment of the funds during the\nU. S. leg of the trip [was] a vital part of the transportation\ndesign or plan\u201d), but not necessarily that secrecy was the\npurpose of the transportation. Agent Nuckles testified\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Concealing or disguising a listed attribute need be only one of the\n\npurposes of the transportation. See \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i) (providing that a\ntransportation plan need be designed \u201cin whole or in part\u201d to conceal or\ndisguise). But here, compensating the leaders of the operation was the\nonly purpose to which Agent Nuckles testified.\n16           REGALADO CUELLAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the secretive manner of transportation was consistent\nwith drug smuggling, see Tr. 179\u2013180, App. 65\u201366, but the\nGovernment failed to introduce any evidence that the\nreason drug smugglers move money to Mexico is to conceal\nor disguise a listed attribute of the funds.\n  Agent Nuckles also testified that Acuna, the Mexican\nborder town to which petitioner was headed, has a cash\neconomy and that U. S. currency is widely accepted there.\nSee Tr. 188\u2013189, App. 69. The Fifth Circuit apparently\nviewed this as evidence that petitioner transported the\nmoney in order to conceal or disguise it: \u201c[G]iven Mexico\u2019s\nlargely cash economy, if [petitioner] had successfully\ntransported the funds to Mexico without detection, the\njury was entitled to find that the funds would have been\nbetter concealed or concealable after the transportation\nthan before.\u201d 478 F. 3d, at 292. The statutory text makes\nclear, however, that a conviction under this provision\nrequires proof that the purpose\u2014not merely effect\u2014of the\ntransportation was to conceal or disguise a listed attrib\u00ad\nute. Although the evidence suggested that petitioner\u2019s\ntransportation would have had the effect of concealing the\nfunds, the evidence did not demonstrate that such con\u00ad\ncealment was the purpose of the transportation because,\nfor instance, there was no evidence that petitioner knew\nabout or intended the effect.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 In many cases, a criminal defendant\u2019s knowledge or purpose is not\n\nestablished by direct evidence but instead is shown circumstantially\nbased on inferences drawn from evidence of effect. See, e.g., 1 W.\nLaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a75.2(a), p. 341 (2d ed. 2003).\nSpecifically, where the consequences of an action are commonly known,\na trier of fact will often infer that the person taking the action knew\nwhat the consequences would be and acted with the purpose of bringing\nthem about. Although, as noted above, the Government introduced\nsome evidence regarding the effect of transporting illegally obtained\nmoney to Mexico, the Government has not pointed to any evidence in\nthe record from which it could be inferred beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico would have had\n                      Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)        17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  In sum, we conclude that the evidence introduced by the\nGovernment was not sufficient to permit a reasonable jury\nto conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner\u2019s\ntransportation was \u201cdesigned in whole or in part . . . to\nconceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source,\nthe ownership, or the control of the proceeds.\u201d\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i).\n                             III\n  The provision of the money laundering statute under\nwhich petitioner was convicted requires proof that the\ntransportation was \u201cdesigned in whole or in part to conceal\nor disguise the nature, the location, the source, the owner\u00ad\nship, or the control\u201d of the funds. \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i). Al\u00ad\nthough this element does not require proof that the defen\u00ad\ndant attempted to create the appearance of legitimate\nwealth, neither can it be satisfied solely by evidence that a\ndefendant concealed the funds during their transport. In\nthis case, the only evidence introduced to prove this ele\u00ad\nment showed that petitioner engaged in extensive efforts\nto conceal the funds en route to Mexico, and thus his con\u00ad\nviction cannot stand. We reverse the judgment of the\nFifth Circuit.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\none of the relevant effects. \n\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

S. C. \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i).\n  Transporting the funds across the border would have\nhad the effect of achieving this objective if, once the funds\nmade it into Mexico, it would have been harder for law\nenforcement authorities in this country (1) to ascertain\nthat the funds were drug proceeds (\u201cnature\u201d), (2) to find\nthe funds (\u201clocation\u201d), (3) to determine where they came\nfrom (\u201csource\u201d), (4) to ascertain who owned them (\u201cowner-\nship\u201d), or (5) to find out who controlled them (\u201ccontrol\u201d).\nBut as the Court notes, ante, at 15, the prosecution had to\nprove, not simply that the transportation of the funds\nfrom the United States to Mexico would have had one of\nthese effects, ibid., but that petitioner knew that achieving\none of these effects was a design (i.e., purpose) of the\ntransportation.\n2          REGALADO CUELLAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\n   As the Court also notes, ante, at 16, n. 8, a criminal\ndefendant\u2019s intent is often inferred. Here, proof of peti-\ntioner\u2019s knowledge and of the intent of the person or per-\nsons who \u201cdesigned\u201d the transportation would have been\nsufficient if the prosecution had introduced evidence show-\ning, not only that taking \u201cdirty\u201d money across the border\nhas one or more of the effects noted above, but that it is\ncommonly known in the relevant circles (that is, among\nthose who design and carry out \u201csuch transportation,\u201d\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)) that taking \u201cdirty\u201d money to Mexico has\none of the effects noted above. Such evidence would per-\nmit a trier of fact to infer (1) that the person or persons\nwho \u201cdesigned\u201d the plan to have the funds taken to Mexico\nintended to achieve the effect in question and (2) that a\nperson like petitioner (that is, a person who is recruited to\ntransport the funds) knew that this was the design.\n   Of course, if the prosecution had introduced such evi-\ndence, the defense could have countered with any avail-\nable proof showing (1) that in fact the achievement of\nthese effects was not a design of the transportation or\n(2) that petitioner in fact did not know that achieving one\nof these effects was a purpose of the plan. It would have\nthen been up to the trier of fact to decide whether the\nstatutory elements had been adequately proven.\n   At petitioner\u2019s trial, as the Court notes, ante, at 16, the\nGovernment introduced some evidence regarding the\neffect of transporting illegally obtained money to Mexico,\nbut the Government has not pointed to any evidence in the\nrecord from which it could be inferred beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that a person like petitioner knew that taking the\nfunds to Mexico would have had one of the relevant ef-\nfects. For this reason, I agree with the Court that peti-\ntioner\u2019s conviction cannot be sustained.\n",

Petitioner argues that his conviction cannot stand because, while the evidence demonstrates that he took steps to hide illicit funds <i>en route</i> to Mexico, it does not show that the cross-border transport of those funds was designed to create the appearance of legitimate wealth. Although we agree with the Government that the statute does not require proof that the defendant attempted to \"legitimize\" tainted funds, we agree with petitioner that the Government must demonstrate that the defendant did more than merely hide the money during its transport. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On July 14, 2004, petitioner Humberto Fidel Regalado Cuellar was stopped in southern Texas for driving erratically. Driving south toward the Mexican border, about 114 miles away, petitioner had just passed the town of Eldorado. In response to the officer's questions, petitioner, who spoke no English, handed the officer a stack of papers. Included were bus tickets showing travel from a Texas border town to San Antonio on July 13 and, in the other direction, from San Antonio to Big Spring, Texas, on July 14. A Spanish-speaking officer, Trooper Danny Nu\u00f1ez, was called to the scene and began questioning petitioner. Trooper Nu\u00f1ez soon became suspicious because petitioner was avoiding eye contact and seemed very nervous. Petitioner claimed to be on a 3-day business trip, but he had no luggage or extra clothing with him, and he gave conflicting accounts of his itinerary. When <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1998</span> Trooper Nu\u00f1ez asked petitioner about a bulge in his shirt pocket, petitioner produced a wad of cash that smelled of marijuana.</p>\n<p>Petitioner consented to a search of the Volkswagen Beetle that he was driving. While the officers were searching the vehicle, Trooper Nu\u00f1ez observed petitioner standing on the side of the road making the sign of the cross, which he interpreted to mean that petitioner knew he was in trouble. A drug detection dog alerted on the cash from petitioner's shirt pocket and on the rear area of the car. Further scrutiny uncovered a secret compartment under the rear floorboard, and inside the compartment the officers found approximately $81,000 in cash. The money was bundled in plastic bags and duct tape, and animal hair was spread in the rear of the vehicle. Petitioner claimed that he had previously transported goats in the vehicle, but Trooper Nu\u00f1ez doubted that goats could fit in such a small space and suspected that the hair had been spread in an attempt to mask the smell of marijuana.</p>\n<p>There were signs that the compartment had been recently created and that someone had attempted to cover up the bodywork: The Beetle's carpeting appeared newer than the rest of the interior, and the exterior of the vehicle appeared to have been purposely splashed with mud to cover up toolmarks, fresh paint, or other work. In the backseat, officers found a fast-food restaurant receipt dated the same day from a city farther north than petitioner claimed to have traveled. After a check of petitioner's last border crossing also proved inconsistent with his story, petitioner was arrested and interrogated. He continued to tell conflicting stories about his travels. At one point, before he knew that the officers had found the cash, he remarked to Trooper Nu\u00f1ez that he had to have the car in Mexico by midnight or else his family would be \"floating down the river.\" App. 50.</p>\n<p>Petitioner was charged with attempting to transport the proceeds of unlawful activity across the border, knowing that the transportation was designed \"to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\" of the money. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i). After a 2-day trial, the jury found petitioner guilty. The District Court denied petitioner's motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence and sentenced petitioner to 78 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p>On appeal, a divided panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed and rendered a judgment of acquittal. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></span> (2006). Judge Smith's majority opinion held that, although the evidence showed that petitioner concealed the money for the purpose of transporting it, the statute requires that the purpose of the transportation itself must be to conceal or disguise the unlawful proceeds. <i>Id.,</i> at 333-334. Analogizing from cases interpreting another provision of the money laundering statute, the court held that the transportation must be undertaken in an attempt to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.<sup>[1]</sup> See <i>id.,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1999</span> 334. Although the evidence showed intent to avoid detection while driving the funds to Mexico, it did not show that petitioner intended to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, and accordingly no rational trier of fact could have found petitioner guilty. <i>Ibid.</i> Judge Davis dissented, arguing that concealment during transportation is sufficient to violate \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i). <i>Id.,</i> at 334-336.</p>\n<p>The Fifth Circuit granted rehearing en banc and affirmed petitioner's conviction. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"47922\"><a href=\"/opinion/47922/usa-v-cuellar/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span> (2007). The court rejected as inconsistent with the statutory text petitioner's argument that the Government must prove that he attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth. <i>Id.,</i> at 290. But it held that petitioner's extensive efforts to prevent detection of the funds during transportation showed that petitioner sought to conceal or disguise the nature, location, and source, ownership, or control of the funds. <i>Id.,</i> at 289-290. Judge Smith dissented for largely the same reasons set forth in his opinion for the original panel majority. He emphasized the distinction between \"concealing something to transport it, and transporting something to conceal it,\" and explained that whether petitioner was doing the latter depended on whether his ultimate plan upon reaching his destination was to conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the money. <i>Id.,</i> at 296-297.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 436, 169 L.Ed.2d 304 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, prohibits specified transfers of money derived from unlawful activities. Subsection (a)(1) makes it unlawful to engage in certain financial transactions, while subsection (a)(2) criminalizes certain kinds of transportation. Petitioner was charged under the transportation provision: The indictment alleged that he attempted to transport illicit proceeds across the Mexican border \"knowing that such transportation was designed in whole or in part to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, and control\" of the funds.<sup>[2]</sup> App. 10-11 (citing \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2000</span> A</h2>\n<p>We first consider the \"designed ... to conceal\" element. Petitioner argues that to satisfy this element, the Government must prove that the defendant attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth. Petitioner would replace \"designed... to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds\" with \"designed to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.\" \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i). This is consistent with the plain meaning of \"money laundering,\" petitioner argues, because that term is commonly understood to mean disguising illegally obtained money in order to make it appear legitimate. In petitioner's view, this common understanding of \"money laundering\" is implicit in both the transaction and transportation provisions of the statute because concealing or disguising any of the listed attributes would necessarily have the effect of making the funds appear legitimate, and, conversely, revealing any such attribute would necessarily reveal the funds as illicit. The Government disagrees, contending that making funds appear legitimate is merely one way to accomplish money laundering, and that revealing a listed attribute would not necessarily reveal the funds' illicit nature. In any event, the Government argues, the statute should not be cabined to target only classic money laundering because Congress intended to reach any conduct that impairs the ability of law enforcement to find and recover the unlawful proceeds.</p>\n<p>We agree with petitioner that taking steps to make funds appear legitimate is the common meaning of the term \"money laundering.\" See American Heritage Dictionary 992 (4th ed.2000) (hereinafter Am. Hert.) (defining \"launder\" as \"[t]o disguise the source or nature of (illegal funds, for example) by channeling through an intermediate agent\"); Black's Law Dictionary 1027 (8th ed.2004) (hereinafter Black's) (defining \"money-laundering\" to mean \"[t]he act of transferring illegally obtained money through legitimate people or accounts so that its original source cannot be traced\"). But to the extent they are inconsistent, we must be guided by the words of the operative statutory provision, and not by the common meaning of the statute's title. See <i>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118228\"><a href=\"/opinion/118228/pennsylvania-dept-of-corrections-v-yeskey/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 212, 118 S.Ct. 1952, 141 L.Ed.2d 215 (1998) (declining to use a statute's title to limit the meaning of the text). Here, Congress used broad language that captures more than classic money laundering: In addition to concealing or disguising the nature or source of illegal funds, Congress also sought to reach transportation designed to conceal or disguise the location, ownership, or control of the funds. For example, a defendant who smuggles cash into Mexico with the intent of hiding it from authorities by burying it in the desert may have engaged in transportation designed to conceal the location of those funds, but his conduct would not necessarily have the effect of making the funds appear legitimate.</p>\n<p>Nor do we find persuasive petitioner's attempt to infuse a \"classic money laundering\" requirement into the listed attributes. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2001</span> Contrary to petitioner's argument, revealing those attributes\u0097nature, location, source, ownership, or control\u0097would not necessarily expose the illegitimacy of the funds. Digging up the cash buried in the Mexican desert, for example, would not necessarily reveal that it was derived from unlawful activity. Indeed, of all the listed attributes, only \"nature\" is coextensive with the funds' illegitimate character: Exposing the nature of illicit funds would, by definition, reveal them as unlawful proceeds. But nature is only one attribute in the statute; that it may be coextensive with the creation of the appearance of legitimate wealth does not mean that Congress intended that requirement to swallow the other listed attributes.</p>\n<p>We likewise are skeptical of petitioner's argument that violating the elements of the statute would necessarily have the effect of making the funds appear more legitimate than they did before. It is true that concealing or disguising any one of the listed attributes may have the effect of making the funds appear more legitimate\u0097largely because concealing or disguising those attributes might impede law enforcement's ability to identify illegitimate funds\u0097but we are not convinced that this is necessarily so. It might be possible for a defendant to conceal or disguise a listed attribute without also creating the appearance of legitimate wealth. Cf. <i>United States v. Abbell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75679\"><a href=\"/opinion/75679/usa-v-michael-abbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1286</span></a></span>, 1298 (C.A.11 2001) (noting that the transaction provision, although designed to punish those who \"attemp[t] to legitimize their proceeds,\" may be satisfied without proof that a particular defendant did so). Petitioner's \"appearance of legitimate wealth\" requirement simply has no basis in the operative provision's text.</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that the money laundering transportation provision must be aimed at something other than merely secretive transportation of illicit funds because that conduct is already punished by the bulk cash smuggling statute, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332 (2000 ed., Supp. V). We disagree. A comparison of the statutory language reveals that, even if no \"appearance of legitimate wealth\" requirement exists in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), the two statutes nonetheless target distinct conduct. The bulk cash smuggling provision encompasses, in relevant part, a defendant who,</p>\n<blockquote>\"with the intent to evade a currency reporting requirement under section 5316, knowingly conceals more than $10,000 in currency or other monetary instruments ... and transports or transfers or attempts to transport or transfer such currency or monetary instruments from a place within the United States to a place outside of the United States.\" 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332(a)(1).</blockquote>\n<p>To be sure, certain conduct may fall within both statutes. For example, both provisions may be violated by a defendant who intends to evade a relevant reporting requirement. See \u00a7 5332(a)(1) (transportation of funds \"with the intent to evade a currency reporting requirement\"); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(ii) (transportation of funds knowing that it is designed \"to avoid a transaction reporting requirement\"). But only the money laundering statute may be violated in the absence of such intent. See \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i) (prohibiting transportation of illicit funds knowing that the transportation is designed to conceal or disguise a listed attribute). Similarly, although both statutes encompass transportation of illicit funds, only the bulk cash smuggling statute also punishes the mere transportation of lawfully derived proceeds.<sup>[3]</sup> Compare 31 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2002</span> U.S.C. \u00a7 5332(a) (omitting any requirement that the funds be unlawfully derived) with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B) (requiring that the defendant \"kno[w] that the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation ... represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Having concluded that the statute contains no \"appearance of legitimate wealth\" requirement, we next consider whether the evidence that petitioner concealed the money during transportation is sufficient to sustain his conviction. As noted, petitioner was convicted under \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), which, in relevant part, makes it a crime to attempt to transport \"funds from a place in the United States to... a place outside the United States ... knowing that the ... funds involved in the transportation ... represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and knowing that such transportation ... is designed in whole or in part ... to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.\" Accordingly, the Government was required in this case to prove that petitioner (1) attempted to transport funds from the United States to Mexico, (2) knew that these funds \"represent[ed] the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,\" <i>e.g.,</i> drug trafficking, and (3) knew that \"such transportation\" was designed to \"conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\" of the funds.</p>\n<p>It is the last of these that is at issue before us, viz., whether petitioner knew that \"such transportation\" was designed to conceal or disguise the specified attributes of the illegally obtained funds. In this connection, it is important to keep in mind that the critical transportation was not the transportation of the funds within this country on the way to the border. Instead, the term \"such transportation\" means transportation \"from a place in the United States to ... a place outside the United States\"\u0097here, from the United States to Mexico. Therefore, what the Government had to prove was that petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico was \"designed,\" at least in part, to conceal or disguise their \"nature,\" \"location,\" \"source,\" \"ownership,\" or \"control.\"</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain his conviction because concealing or disguising a listed attribute of the funds during transportation cannot satisfy the \"designed ... to conceal\" element. Citing cases that interpret the identical phrase in the transaction provision to exclude \"mere spending,\"<sup>[4]</sup> petitioner argues that the transportation provision must exclude \"mere hiding.\" Otherwise, petitioner contends, all cross-border transport of illicit funds would fall under the statute because people regularly make minimal efforts to conceal money, such as placing it inside a wallet or other receptacle, in order to secure it during travel. The Government responds that concealment during transportation is sufficient to satisfy this element because it is circumstantial evidence that the ultimate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2003</span> purpose of the transportation\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> its \"design\"\u0097is to conceal or disguise a listed attribute of the funds. This standard would not criminalize all cross-border transport of illicit funds, the Government argues, because, just as in the transaction cases,<sup>[5]</sup> the statute encompasses only <i>substantial</i> efforts at concealment. As a result, the Government agrees with the Court of Appeals that a violation of the transportation provision cannot be established solely by evidence that the defendant carried money in a wallet or concealed it in some other conventional or incidental way. See 478 F.3d, at 291 (characterizing the defendant's transportation of money in a box in <i>United States v. Dimeck,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670621\"><a href=\"/opinion/670621/united-states-v-kevin-j-dimeck/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span>, 1246 (C.A.10 1994), as a \"minimal attempt at concealment\" that is distinguishable from petitioner's \"effort to hide or conceal\" the funds).</p>\n<p>We agree with petitioner that merely hiding funds during transportation is not sufficient to violate the statute, even if substantial efforts have been expended to conceal the money. Our conclusion turns on the text of \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), and particularly on the term \"design.\" In this context, \"design\" means purpose or plan; <i>i.e.,</i> the intended aim of the transportation. See Am. Hert. 491 (\"To formulate a plan for; devise\"; \"[t]o create or contrive for a particular purpose or effect\"); Black's 478 (\"A plan or scheme\"; \"[p]urpose or intention combined with a plan\"); see also Brief for United States 14 (\"`to conceive and plan out in the mind'\" (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 611 (1993))). Congress wrote \"knowing that such transportation is designed ... to conceal or disguise\" a listed attribute of the funds, \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), and when an act is \"designed to\" do something, the most natural reading is that it has that something as its purpose. The Fifth Circuit employed this meaning of design when it referred to the \"transportation design or plan to get the funds out of this country.\" See 478 F.3d, at 289.</p>\n<p>But the Fifth Circuit went on to discuss the \"design\" of the transportation in a different sense. It described the packaging of the money, its placement in the hidden compartment, and the use of animal hair to mask its scent as \"<i>aspects</i> of the transportation\" that \"were designed to conceal or disguise\" the nature and location of the cash. <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Because the Fifth Circuit used \"design\" to refer not to the purpose of the transportation but to the manner in which it was carried out, its use of the term in this context was consistent with the alternate meaning of \"design\" as structure or arrangement. See Am. Hert. 491, 492 (\"To plan out in systematic, usually graphic form\"; \"[t]he purposeful or inventive arrangement of parts or details\"); Black's 478 (\"The pattern or configuration of elements in something, such as a work of art\"). The Government at times also appears to adopt this meaning of \"design.\" See Brief for United States 21 (\"Congress focused on how the transportation itself was `designed'\"); <i>id.,</i> at 43 (arguing that petitioner's design to move funds without detection is proof of a design to conceal or disguise the location and nature of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2004</span> funds).<sup>[6]</sup> If the statutory term had this meaning, it would apply whenever a person transported illicit funds in a secretive manner. Judge Smith supplied an example of this construction: A petty thief who hides money in his shoe and then walks across the border to spend the money in local bars, see 478 F.3d, at 301 (dissenting opinion), has engaged in transportation designed to conceal the location of the money because he has hidden it in an unlikely place.</p>\n<p>We think it implausible, however, that Congress intended this meaning of \"design.\" If it had, it could have expressed its intention simply by writing \"knowing that such transportation conceals or disguises,\" rather than the more complex formulation \"knowing that such transportation... is designed ... to conceal or disguise.\" \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i). It seems far more likely that Congress intended courts to apply the familiar criminal law concepts of purpose and intent than to focus exclusively on how a defendant \"structured\" the transportation. In addition, the structural meaning of \"design\" is both overinclusive and underinclusive: It would capture individuals who structured transportation in a secretive way but lacked any criminal intent (such as a person who hid illicit funds <i>en route</i> to turn them over to law enforcement); yet it would exclude individuals who fully intended to move the funds in order to impede detection by law enforcement but failed to hide them during the transportation.</p>\n<p>To be sure, purpose and structure are often related. One may employ structure to achieve a purpose: For example, the petty thief may hide money in his shoe to prevent it from being detected as he crosses the border with the intent to hide the money in Mexico. See 478 F.3d, at 301 (Smith, J., dissenting). Although transporting money in a conventional manner may suggest no particular purpose other than simply to move it from one place to another, secretively transporting it suggests, at least, that the defendant did not want the money to be detected during transport. In this case, evidence of the methods petitioner used to transport the nearly $81,000 in cash\u0097bundled in plastic bags and hidden in a secret compartment covered with animal hair\u0097was plainly probative of an underlying goal to prevent the funds from being detected while he drove them from the United States to Mexico. The same secretive aspects of the transportation also may be circumstantial evidence that the transportation itself was intended to avoid detection of the funds, because, for example, they may suggest that the transportation is only one step in a larger plan to facilitate the cross-border transport of the funds. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 289 (noting that \"concealment of the funds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2005</span> during the U.S. leg of the trip [was] a vital part of the transportation design or plan to get the funds out of this country\"). But its probative force, in that context, is weak. \"There is a difference between concealing something to transport it, and transporting something to conceal it,\" <i>id.,</i> at 296-297 (Smith, J., dissenting); that is, <i>how</i> one moves the money is distinct from <i>why</i> one moves the money. Evidence of the former, standing alone, is not sufficient to prove the latter.</p>\n<p>This case illustrates why: Even with abundant evidence that petitioner had concealed the money in order to transport it, the Government's own expert witness\u0097 ICE Agent Richard Nuckles\u0097testified that the purpose of the transportation was to compensate the leaders of the operation.<sup>[7]</sup> Tr. 179 (Oct. 12, 2004), App. 64-65 (\"[T]he bulk of [the money] generally goes back to Mexico, because the smuggler is the one who originated this entire process. He's going to get a large cut of the profit, and that money has to be moved back to him in Mexico\"). The evidence suggested that the secretive aspects of the transportation were employed to <i>facilitate</i> the transportation, see 478 F.3d, at 289 (noting that \"concealment of the funds during the U.S. leg of the trip [was] a vital part of the transportation design or plan\"), but not necessarily that secrecy was the <i>purpose</i> of the transportation. Agent Nuckles testified that the secretive manner of transportation was consistent with drug smuggling, see Tr. 179-180, App. 65-66, but the Government failed to introduce any evidence that the reason drug smugglers move money to Mexico is to conceal or disguise a listed attribute of the funds.</p>\n<p>Agent Nuckles also testified that Acuna, the Mexican border town to which petitioner was headed, has a cash economy and that U.S. currency is widely accepted there. See Tr. 188-189, App. 69. The Fifth Circuit apparently viewed this as evidence that petitioner transported the money in order to conceal or disguise it: \"[G]iven Mexico's largely cash economy, if [petitioner] had successfully transported the funds to Mexico without detection, the jury was entitled to find that the funds would have been better concealed or concealable after the transportation than before.\" 478 F.3d, at 292. The statutory text makes clear, however, that a conviction under this provision requires proof that the purpose\u0097not merely effect\u0097of the transportation was to conceal or disguise a listed attribute. Although the evidence suggested that petitioner's transportation would have had the effect of concealing the funds, the evidence did not demonstrate that such concealment was the purpose of the transportation because, for instance, there was no evidence that petitioner knew about or intended the effect.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2006</span> In sum, we conclude that the evidence introduced by the Government was not sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner's transportation was \"designed in whole or in part ... to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds.\" \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The provision of the money laundering statute under which petitioner was convicted requires proof that the transportation was \"designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\" of the funds. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i). Although this element does not require proof that the defendant attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, neither can it be satisfied solely by evidence that a defendant concealed the funds during their transport. In this case, the only evidence introduced to prove this element showed that petitioner engaged in extensive efforts to conceal the funds <i>en route</i> to Mexico, and thus his conviction cannot stand. We reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice KENNEDY join, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court but write briefly to summarize my understanding of the deficiency in the Government's proof.</p>\n<p>As the Court notes, <i>ante,</i> at 2002, the Government was required in this case to prove that petitioner knew that the plan to transport the funds across the Mexican border was designed at least in part to \"conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\" of the funds. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>Transporting the funds across the border would have had the <i>effect</i> of achieving this objective if, once the funds made it into Mexico, it would have been harder for law enforcement authorities in this country (1) to ascertain that the funds were drug proceeds (\"nature\"), (2) to find the funds (\"location\"), (3) to determine where they came from (\"source\"), (4) to ascertain who owned them (\"ownership\"), or (5) to find out who controlled them (\"control\"). But as the Court notes, <i>ante,</i> at 2005, the prosecution had to prove, not simply that the transportation of the funds from the United States to Mexico would have had one of these <i>effects, ibid.,</i> but that petitioner <i>knew</i> that achieving one of these effects was a <i>design</i> (<i>i.e.,</i> purpose) of the transportation.</p>\n<p>As the Court also notes, <i>ante,</i> at 2005, n. 8, a criminal defendant's intent is often inferred. Here, proof of petitioner's knowledge and of the intent of the person or persons who \"designed\" the transportation would have been sufficient if the prosecution had introduced evidence showing, not only that taking \"dirty\" money across the border has one or more of the effects noted above, but that it is commonly known in the relevant circles (that is, among those who design and carry out \"such transportation,\" \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)) that taking \"dirty\" money to Mexico has one of the effects noted above. Such evidence would permit a trier of fact to infer (1) that the person or persons who \"designed\" the plan to have the funds taken to Mexico intended to achieve the effect in question and (2) that a person like petitioner (that is, a person who is recruited to transport the funds) knew that this was the design.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2007</span> Of course, if the prosecution had introduced such evidence, the defense could have countered with any available proof showing (1) that in fact the achievement of these effects was not a design of the transportation or (2) that petitioner in fact did not know that achieving one of these effects was a purpose of the plan. It would have then been up to the trier of fact to decide whether the statutory elements had been adequately proven.</p>\n<p>At petitioner's trial, as the Court notes, <i>ante,</i> at 2005, the Government introduced some evidence regarding the effect of transporting illegally obtained money to Mexico, but the Government has not pointed to any evidence in the record from which it could be inferred beyond a reasonable doubt that a person like petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico would have had one of the relevant effects. For this reason, I agree with the Court that petitioner's conviction cannot be sustained.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Several Courts of Appeals have considered this requirement as relevant, or even necessary, in the context of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), which prohibits, <i>inter alia,</i> engaging in financial transactions \"involv[ing] the proceeds of specified unlawful activity ... knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part ... to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of some specified unlawful activity.\" See <i>United States v.

See \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i) (providing that a transportation plan need be designed \"in whole or in part\" to conceal or disguise). But here, compensating the leaders of the operation was the only purpose to which Agent Nuckles testified.</p>\n<p>[8]  In many cases, a criminal defendant's knowledge or purpose is not established by direct evidence but instead is shown circumstantially based on inferences drawn from evidence of effect. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 5.2(a), p. 341 (2d ed.2003). Specifically, where the consequences of an action are commonly known, a trier of fact will often infer that the person taking the action knew what the consequences would be and acted with the purpose of bringing them about. Although, as noted above, the Government introduced some evidence regarding the effect of transporting illegally obtained money to Mexico, the Government has not pointed to any evidence in the record from which it could be inferred beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico would have had one of the relevant effects.</p>\n\n</div>",
