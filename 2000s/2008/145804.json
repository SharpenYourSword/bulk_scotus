See Ind.Code \u00a7 35-45-5-3 (West 2004). Santos employed a number of helpers to run the lottery. At bars and restaurants, Santos's runners gathered bets from gamblers, kept a portion of the bets (between 15% and 25%) as their commissions, and delivered the rest to Santos's collectors. Collectors, one of whom was respondent Diaz, then delivered the money to Santos, who used some of it to pay the salaries of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2023</span> collectors (including Diaz) and to pay the winners.</p>\n<p>These payments to runners, collectors, and winners formed the basis of a 10-count indictment filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, naming Santos, Diaz, and 11 others. A jury found Santos guilty of one count of conspiracy to run an illegal gambling business (\u00a7 371), one count of running an illegal gambling business (\u00a7 1955), one count of conspiracy to launder money (\u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and \u00a7 1956(h)), and two counts of money laundering (\u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i)). The court sentenced Santos to 60 months of imprisonment on the two gambling counts and to 210 months of imprisonment on the three money-laundering counts. Diaz pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money, and the District Court sentenced him to 108 months of imprisonment. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences. <i>United States v. Febus,</i> 218 F.3d 784 (C.A.7 2000). We declined to review the case. 531 U.S. 1021, 121 S.Ct. 587, 148 L.Ed.2d 503 (2000).</p>\n<p>Thereafter, respondents filed motions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, collaterally attacking their convictions and sentences. The District Court rejected all of their claims but one, a challenge to their money-laundering convictions based on the Seventh Circuit's subsequent decision in <i>United States v. Scialabba,</i> 282 F.3d 475 (2002), which held that the federal money-laundering statute's prohibition of transactions involving criminal \"proceeds\" applies only to transactions involving criminal profits, not criminal receipts. <i>Id.,</i> at 478. Applying that holding to respondents' cases, the District Court found no evidence that the transactions on which the money-laundering convictions were based (Santos's payments to runners, winners, and collectors and Diaz's receipt of payment for his collection services) involved profits, as opposed to receipts, of the illegal lottery, and accordingly vacated the money-laundering convictions. The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the Government's contention that <i>Scialabba</i> was wrong and should be overruled. 461 F.3d 886 (C.A.7 2006). We granted certiorari. 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2098, 167 L.Ed.2d 812 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The federal money-laundering statute prohibits a number of activities involving criminal \"proceeds.\" Most relevant to this case is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), which criminalizes transactions to promote criminal activity.<sup>[1]</sup> This provision uses the term \"proceeds\" in describing two elements of the offense: the Government must prove that a charged transaction \"in fact involve[d] the proceeds of specified unlawful activity\" (the proceeds element), and it also must prove that a defendant knew \"that the property involved in\" the charged transaction \"represent[ed] the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity\" (the knowledge element). \u00a7 1956(a)(1).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2024</span> The federal money-laundering statute does not define \"proceeds.\" When a term is undefined, we give it its ordinary meaning. <i>Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer,</i> 513 U.S. 179, 187, 115 S.Ct. 788, 130 L.Ed.2d 682 (1995). \"Proceeds\" can mean either \"receipts\" or \"profits.\" Both meanings are accepted, and have long been accepted, in ordinary usage. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 12 Oxford English Dictionary 544 (2d ed.1989); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1542 (2d ed.1987); Webster's New International Dictionary 1972 (2d ed.1957) (hereinafter Webster's 2d). The Government contends that dictionaries generally prefer the \"receipts\" definition over the \"profits\" definition, but any preference is too slight for us to conclude that \"receipts\" is the <i>primary</i> meaning of \"proceeds.\"</p>\n<p>\"Proceeds,\" moreover, has not acquired a common meaning in the provisions of the Federal Criminal Code. Most leave the term undefined. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853. Recognizing the word's inherent ambiguity, Congress has defined \"proceeds\" in various criminal provisions, but sometimes has defined it to mean \"receipts\" and sometimes \"profits.\" Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339C(e)(3) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (receipts), \u00a7 981(a)(2)(A) (2000 ed.) (same), with \u00a7 981(a)(2)(B) (profits).</p>\n<p>Since context gives meaning, we cannot say the money-laundering statute is truly ambiguous until we consider \"proceeds\" not in isolation but as it is used in the federal money-laundering statute. See <i>United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd.,</i> 484 U.S. 365, 371, 108 S.Ct. 626, 98 L.Ed.2d 740 (1988). The word appears repeatedly throughout the statute, but all of those appearances leave the ambiguity intact. Section 1956(a)(1) itself, for instance, makes sense under either definition: one can engage in a financial transaction with either receipts or profits of a crime; one can intend to promote the carrying on of a crime with either its receipts or its profits; and one can try to conceal the nature, location, etc., of either receipts or profits. The same is true of all the other provisions of this legislation in which the term \"proceeds\" is used. They make sense under either definition. See, for example, \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B), which speaks of \"proceeds\" represented by a \"monetary instrument or funds.\"</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO's dissent (the principal dissent) makes much of the fact that 14 States that use <i>and define</i> the word \"proceeds\" in their money-laundering statutes,<sup>[2]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2025</span> the Model Money Laundering Act, and an international treaty on the subject, all define the term to include gross receipts. See <i>post,</i> at 2036-2038. We do not think this evidence shows that the drafters of the federal money-laundering statute used \"proceeds\" as a term of art for \"receipts.\" Most of the state laws cited by the dissent, the Model Act, and the treaty postdate the 1986 federal money-laundering statute by several years, so Congress was not acting against the backdrop of those definitions when it enacted the federal statute. If anything, they show that \"proceeds\" is ambiguous and that others who believed that money-laundering statutes ought to include gross receipts sought to clarify the ambiguity that Congress created when it left the term undefined.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Under either of the word's ordinary definitions, all provisions of the federal money-laundering statute are coherent; no provisions are redundant; and the statute is not rendered utterly absurd. From the face of the statute, there is no more reason to think that \"proceeds\" means \"receipts\" than there is to think that \"proceeds\" means \"profits.\" Under a long line of our decisions, the tie must go to the defendant. The rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them. See <i>United States v. Gradwell,</i> 243 U.S. 476, 485, 37 S.Ct. 407, 61 L.Ed. 857 (1917); <i>McBoyle v. United States,</i> 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931); <i>United States v. Bass,</i> 404 U.S. 336, 347-349, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971). This venerable rule not only vindicates the fundamental principle that no citizen should be held accountable for a violation of a statute whose commands are uncertain, or subjected to punishment that is not clearly prescribed. It also places the weight of inertia upon the party that can best induce Congress to speak more clearly and keeps courts from making criminal law in Congress's stead. Because the \"profits\" definition of \"proceeds\" is always more defendant-friendly than the \"receipts\" definition, the rule of lenity dictates that it should be adopted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Stopping short of calling the \"profits\" interpretation absurd, the Government contends that the interpretation should nonetheless be rejected because it fails to give the federal money-laundering statute its proper scope and because it hinders effective enforcement of the law. Neither contention overcomes the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>According to the Government, if we do not read \"proceeds\" to mean \"receipts,\" we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2026</span> will disserve the purpose of the federal money-laundering statute, which is, the Government says, to penalize criminals who conceal or promote their illegal activities. On the Government's view, \"[t]he gross receipts of a crime accurately reflect the scale of the criminal activity, because the illegal activity generated all of the funds.\" Brief for United States 21; see also <i>post,</i> at 2037-2039 (ALITO, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>When interpreting a criminal statute, we do not play the part of a mind reader. In our seminal rule-of-lenity decision, Chief Justice Marshall rejected the impulse to speculate regarding a dubious congressional intent. \"[P]robability is not a guide which a court, in construing a penal statute, can safely take.\" <i>United States v. Wiltberger,</i> 5 Wheat. 76, 105, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820). And Justice Frankfurter, writing for the Court in another case, said the following: \"When Congress leaves to the Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an undeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity.\" <i>Bell v. United States,</i> 349 U.S. 81, 83, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955).</p>\n<p>The statutory purpose advanced by the Government to construe \"proceeds\" is a textbook example of begging the question. To be sure, if \"proceeds\" meant \"receipts,\" one could say that the statute was aimed at the dangers of concealment and promotion. But whether \"proceeds\" means \"receipts\" is the very issue in the case. If \"proceeds\" means \"profits,\" one could say that the statute is aimed at the distinctive danger that arises from leaving in criminal hands the yield of a crime. A rational Congress could surely have decided that the risk of leveraging one criminal activity into the next poses a greater threat to society than the mere payment of crime-related expenses and justifies the money-laundering statute's harsh penalties.</p>\n<p>If we accepted the Government's invitation to speculate about congressional purpose, we would also have to confront and explain the strange consequence of the \"receipts\" interpretation, which respondents have described as a \"merger problem.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondent Diaz 34. If \"proceeds\" meant \"receipts,\" nearly every violation of the illegal-lottery statute would also be a violation of the money-laundering statute, because paying a winning bettor is a transaction involving receipts that the defendant intends to promote the carrying on of the lottery. Since few lotteries, if any, will not pay their winners, the statute criminalizing illegal lotteries, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955, would \"merge\" with the money-laundering statute. Congress evidently decided that lottery operators ordinarily deserve up to 5 years of imprisonment, \u00a7 1955(a), but as a result of merger they would face an additional 20 years, \u00a7 1956(a)(1). Prosecutors, of course, would acquire the discretion to charge the lesser lottery offense, the greater money-laundering offense, or both\u0097which would predictably be used to induce a plea bargain to the lesser charge.</p>\n<p>The merger problem is not limited to lottery operators. For a host of predicate crimes, merger would depend on the manner and timing of payment for the expenses associated with the commission of the crime. Few crimes are entirely free of cost, and costs are not always paid in advance. Anyone who pays for the costs of a crime with its proceeds\u0097for example, the felon who uses the stolen money to pay for the rented getaway car\u0097would violate the money-laundering statute. And any wealth-acquiring crime with multiple participants would become money-laundering when the initial recipient of the wealth gives his confederates their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2027</span> shares.<sup>[4]</sup> Generally speaking, any specified unlawful activity, an episode of which includes transactions which are not elements of the offense and in which a participant passes receipts on to someone else, would merge with money laundering. There are more than 250 predicate offenses for the money-laundering statute, see Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, M. Motivans, Money Laundering Offenders 1994-2001, p. 2 (2003), online at http:// www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/mlo01.pdf (as visited May 29, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file), and many foreseeably entail such transactions, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(c)(7) (establishing as predicate offenses a number of illegal trafficking and selling offenses, the expenses of which might be paid after the illegal transportation or sale).</p>\n<p>The Government suggests no explanation for why Congress would have wanted a transaction that is a normal part of a crime it had duly considered and appropriately punished elsewhere in the Criminal Code to radically increase the sentence for that crime. Interpreting \"proceeds\" to mean \"profits\" eliminates the merger problem. Transactions that normally occur during the course of running a lottery are not identifiable uses of profits and thus do not violate the money-laundering statute. More generally, a criminal who enters into a transaction paying the expenses of his illegal activity cannot possibly violate the money-laundering statute, because by definition profits consist of what remains after expenses are paid. Defraying an activity's costs with its receipts simply will not be covered.</p>\n<p>The principal dissent suggests that a solution to the merger problem may be found in giving a narrow interpretation to the \"promotion prong\" of the statute: A defendant might be deemed not to \"promote\" illegal activity \"by doing those things ... that are needed merely to keep the business running,\" <i>post,</i> at 2044, because promotion (presumably) means doing things that will cause a business to grow. See Webster's 2d, p.1981 (giving as one of the meanings of \"promote\" \"[t]o contribute to the growth [or] enlargement\" of something). (This argument is embraced by Justice BREYER's dissent as well. See <i>post,</i> at 2034-2035.) The federal money-laundering statute, however, bars not the bare act of promotion, but engaging in certain transactions \"with the intent to promote <i>the carrying on</i> of specified unlawful activity.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added). In that context the word naturally bears one of its other meanings, such as \"[t]o contribute to the ... prosperity\" of something, or to \"further\" something. See Webster's 2d, p.1981. Surely one promotes \"the carrying on\" of a gambling enterprise by merely assuring that it continues in business.<sup>[5]</sup> In any event, to believe <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2028</span> that this \"narrow\" interpretation of \"promote\" would solve the merger problem one must share the dissent's misperception that the statute applies just to the conduct of ongoing enterprises rather than individual unlawful acts. If the predicate act is theft by an individual, it makes no sense to ask whether an expenditure was intended to \"grow\" the culprit's theft business. The merger problem thus stands as a major obstacle to the dissent's interpretation of \"proceeds.\"</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER admits that the merger problem casts doubt on the Government's position, <i>post,</i> at 2034, but believes there are \"other, more legally felicitous\" solutions to the problem, <i>post,</i> at 2035. He suggests that the merger problem could be solved by holding that \"the money laundering offense and the underlying offense that generated the money to be laundered must be distinct in order to be separately punishable.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The insuperable difficulty with this solution is that it has no basis whatever in the words of the statute. Even assuming (as one should not) the propriety of a judicial rewrite, why should one believe that Congress wanted courts to avoid the merger problem in that unusual fashion, rather than by adopting one of the two possible meanings of an ambiguous term? Justice BREYER pins hope on the possibility, \"if the `merger' problem is essentially a problem of fairness in sentencing,\" that the United States Sentencing Commission might revise its recommended sentences for money laundering. <i>Post,</i> at 2034-2035. See also principal dissent, <i>post,</i> at 2044-2045 (in agreement). Even if that is a possibility, it is not a certainty. And once again, why should one choose this chancy method of solving the problem, rather than interpret ambiguous language to avoid it? In any event, as noted, <i>supra,</i> at 2026, the merger problem affects more than just sentencing; it affects charging decisions and plea-bargaining as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Government also argues for the \"receipts\" interpretation because\u0097quite frankly\u0097it is easier to prosecute. Proving the proceeds and knowledge elements of the federal money-laundering offense under the \"profits\" interpretation will unquestionably require proof that is more difficult to obtain. Essentially, the Government asks us to resolve the statutory ambiguity in light of Congress's presumptive intent to facilitate money-laundering prosecutions. That position turns the rule of lenity upside-down. We interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of defendants, not prosecutors.</p>\n<p>It is true that the \"profits\" interpretation demands more from the Government than the \"receipts\" interpretation. Not so much more, however, as to render such a disposition inconceivable\u0097as proved by the fact that Congress has imposed similar proof burdens upon the prosecution elsewhere. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(a) (criminal forfeiture provision requiring determination of \"gross profits or other proceeds\"); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a) (same).<sup>[6]</sup> It is untrue that the added burdens \"serve no discernible purpose.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2041 (ALITO, J., dissenting). They ensure that the severe money-laundering penalties will be imposed only for the removal of profits from criminal activity, which permit the leveraging <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2029</span> of one criminal activity into the next. See <i>supra,</i> at 2025-2026.</p>\n<p>In any event, the Government exaggerates the difficulties. The \"proceeds of specified unlawful activity\" are the proceeds from the conduct sufficient to prove <i>one</i> predicate offense. Thus, to establish the proceeds element under the \"profits\" interpretation, the prosecution needs to show only that a single instance of specified unlawful activity was profitable and gave rise to the money involved in a charged transaction. And the Government, of course, can select the instances for which the profitability is clearest. Contrary to the principal dissent's view, <i>post,</i> at 2038, 2040-2041, the factfinder will not need to consider gains, expenses, and losses attributable to other instances of specified unlawful activity, which go to the profitability of some entire criminal enterprise. What counts is whether the receipts from the charged unlawful act exceeded the costs fairly attributable to it.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>When the Government charges an \"enterprise\" crime as the predicate offense, see, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(c)(7)(C), it will have to prove the profitability of only the conduct sufficient to violate the enterprise statute. That is typically defined as a \"continuing series of violations,\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(c)(2), which would presumably be satisfied by three violations, see <i>Richardson v. United States,</i> 526 U.S. 813, 818, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999). Thus, the Government will have to prove the profitability of just three offenses, selecting (again) those for which profitability is clearest. And of course a prosecutor will often be able to charge the underlying crimes instead of the overarching enterprise crime.</p>\n<p>As for the knowledge element of the money-laundering offense\u0097knowledge that the transaction involves profits of unlawful activity\u0097that will be provable (as knowledge must almost always be proved) by circumstantial evidence. For example, someone accepting receipts from what he knows to be a long-continuing drug-dealing operation can be found to know that they include some profits. And a jury could infer from a long-running launderer-criminal relationship that the launderer knew he was hiding the criminal's profits. Moreover, the Government will be entitled to a willful blindness instruction if the professional money launderer, aware of a high probability that the laundered funds were profits, deliberately avoids learning the truth about them\u0097as might be the case when he knows that the underlying crime is one that is rarely unprofitable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2030</span> IV</h2>\n<p>Concurring in the judgment, Justice STEVENS expresses the view that the rule of lenity applies to this case because there is no legislative history reflecting any legislator's belief about how the money-laundering statute should apply to lottery operators. See <i>post,</i> at 2032, 2033. The rule of lenity might not apply, he thinks, in a case involving an organized crime syndicate or the sale of contraband because the legislative history supposedly contains some views on the meaning of \"proceeds\" in those circumstances.<sup>[8]</sup> See <i>post,</i> at 2031-2032, and n. 3. In short, Justice STEVENS would interpret \"proceeds\" to mean \"profits\" for some predicate crimes, \"receipts\" for others.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS' position is original with him; neither the United States nor any <i>amicus</i> suggested it; it has no precedent in our cases. Justice STEVENS relies on the proposition that one undefined word, repeated in different statutory provisions, can have different meanings in each provision. See <i>post,</i> at 2032, and n. 2. But that is worlds apart from giving the same word, <i>in the same statutory provision,</i> different meanings <i>in different factual contexts.</i> Not only have we never engaged in such interpretive contortion; just over three years ago, in an opinion joined by Justice STEVENS, we forcefully rejected it. <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U.S. 371, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005), held that the meaning of words in a statute cannot change with the statute's application. See <i>id.,</i> at 378, 125 S.Ct. 716. To hold otherwise \"would render every statute a chameleon,\" <i>id.,</i> at 382, 125 S.Ct. 716, and \"would establish within our jurisprudence... the dangerous principle that judges can give the same statutory text different meanings in different cases,\" <i>id.,</i> at 386, 125 S.Ct. 716. Precisely to avoid that result, our cases often \"give a statute's ambiguous language a limiting construction called for by one of the statute's applications, even though other of the statute's applications, standing alone, would not support the same limitation. <i>The lowest common denominator, as it were, must govern.</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 380, 125 S.Ct. 716 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Our obligation to maintain the consistent meaning of words in statutory text does not disappear when the rule of lenity is involved. To the contrary, we have resolved an ambiguity in a tax statute in favor of the taxpayer in a civil case because the statute had criminal applications that triggered the rule of lenity. See <i>United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Co.,</i> 504 U.S. 505, 517-518, and n. 10, 112 S.Ct. 2102, 119 L.Ed.2d 308 (1992) (plurality opinion). If anything, the rule of lenity is an additional reason to remain consistent, lest those subject to the criminal law be misled. And even if, as Justice STEVENS contends, <i>post,</i> at 2031, statutory ambiguity \"effectively\" licenses us to write a brand-new law, we cannot accept that power in a criminal case, where the law must be written by Congress. See <i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2031</span> <i>States v. Hudson,</i> 7 Cranch 32, 34, 3 L.Ed. 259 (1812).</p>\n<p>We think it appropriate to add a word concerning the <i>stare decisis</i> effect of Justice STEVENS' opinion. Since his vote is necessary to our judgment, and since his opinion rests upon the narrower ground, the Court's holding is limited accordingly. See <i>Marks v. United States,</i> 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977). But the narrowness of his ground consists of finding that \"proceeds\" means \"profits\" when there is no legislative history to the contrary. That is all that our judgment holds. It does not hold that the outcome is different when contrary legislative history does exist. Justice STEVENS' speculations on that point address a case that is not before him, are the purest of dicta, and form no part of today's holding. Thus, as far as this particular statute is concerned, counsel remain free to argue Justice STEVENS' view (and to explain why it does not overrule <i>Clark v. Martinez, supra</i>). They should be warned, however: Not only do the Justices joining this opinion reject that view, but so also (apparently) do the Justices joining the principal dissent. See <i>post,</i> at 2036, 2044.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>The money-laundering charges brought against Santos were based on his payments to the lottery winners and his employees, and the money-laundering charge brought against Diaz was based on his receipt of payments as an employee. Neither type of transaction can fairly be characterized as involving the lottery's profits. Indeed, the Government did not try to prove, and respondents have not admitted, that they laundered criminal profits. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>When Congress fails to define potentially ambiguous statutory terms, it effectively delegates to federal judges the task of filling gaps in a statute. See <i>Commissioner v. Fink,</i> 483 U.S. 89, 104, 107 S.Ct. 2729, 97 L.Ed.2d 74 (1987) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"In the process of legislating it is inevitable that Congress will leave open spaces in the law that the courts are implicitly authorized to fill\"). Congress has included definitions of the term \"proceeds\" in some criminal statutes,<sup>[1]</sup> but it has not done so in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 (2000 ed. and Supp. V), the money laundering statute at issue in this case. That statute is somewhat unique because it applies to the proceeds of a varied and lengthy list of specified unlawful activities, see \u00a7 1956(c)(7) (defining \"specified unlawful activity\" to include, <i>inter alia,</i> controlled substance violations, murder, bribery, smuggling, various forms of fraud, concealment of assets, various environmental offenses, and health care offenses).</p>\n<p>Although it did not do so, it seems clear that Congress could have provided that the term \"proceeds\" shall have one meaning when referring to some specified unlawful activities and a different meaning when referring to others. In fact, in the general civil forfeiture statute, \u00a7 981, Congress did provide two different definitions of \"proceeds,\" recognizing that\u0097for a subset of activities\u0097\"proceeds\" must allow for the deduction of costs. Compare \u00a7 981(a)(2)(A) (2000 ed.) (defining \"proceeds\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2032</span> in cases involving illegal goods and services to mean \"property of any kind obtained directly or indirectly ... not limited to the net gain or profit realized from the offense\") with \u00a7 981(a)(2)(B) (defining \"proceeds\" with respect to lawful goods sold in an illegal manner as the amount of money acquired \"less the direct costs incurred in providing the goods or services\").</p>\n<p>We have previously recognized that the same word can have different meanings in the same statute.<sup>[2]</sup> If Congress could have expressly defined the term \"proceeds\" differently when applied to different specified unlawful activities, it seems to me that judges filling the gap in a statute with such a variety of applications may also do so, as long as they are conscientiously endeavoring to carry out the intent of Congress. Therefore, contrary to what Justice ALITO and the plurality state, see <i>post,</i> at 2044 (dissenting opinion); <i>ante,</i> at 2030-2031 (plurality opinion), this Court need not pick a single definition of \"proceeds\" applicable to every unlawful activity, no matter how incongruous some applications may be.</p>\n<p>As Justice ALITO rightly argues, the legislative history of \u00a7 1956 makes it clear that Congress intended the term \"proceeds\" to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales.<sup>[3]</sup> But that history sheds no light on how to identify the proceeds of many other types of specified unlawful activities. For example, one specified unlawful activity is the conduct proscribed by \u00a7 541, \"Entry of goods falsely classified.\" Section 541 provides that \"[w]hoever knowingly effects any entry of goods, wares, or merchandise, at less than the true weight or measure thereof, or upon a false classification as to quality or value, or by the payment of less than the amount of duty legally due, shall be ... imprisoned not more than two years.\" Conceivably the \"proceeds\" stemming from a violation of \u00a7 541 could be either the money realized by misstating the value\u0097that is, the amount by which the criminal \"profits\" by paying reduced duties\u0097or the total price at which the goods are later sold, even though the misclassification had only a trivial impact on that price.</p>\n<p>Just as the legislative history fails to tell us how to calculate the \"proceeds\" of violations of \u00a7 541, it is equally silent on the proceeds of an unlicensed stand-alone gambling venture. The consequences of applying a \"gross receipts\" definition of \"proceeds\" to the gambling operation conducted by respondents are so perverse that I cannot believe they were contemplated by Congress, particularly given the fact that nothing in Justice ALITO's thorough review of the legislative history indicates otherwise.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Constrained by a holding that the payment of expenses constitutes \"promotion,\"<sup>[5]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2033</span> Justice ALITO's opinion runs squarely into what can be characterized as the \"merger\" problem. Allowing the Government to treat the mere payment of the expense of operating an illegal gambling business as a separate offense is in practical effect tantamount to double jeopardy, which is particularly unfair in this case because the penalties for money laundering are substantially more severe than those for the underlying offense of operating a gambling business. A money laundering conviction increases the statutory maximum from 5 to 20 years, and the Sentencing Commission has prescribed different Guidelines ranges for the two crimes.<sup>[6]</sup> When a defendant has a significant criminal history or Guidelines enhancements apply, the statutory cap of five years in \u00a7 1955 is an important limitation on a defendant's sentence\u0097a limitation that would be eviscerated if Justice ALITO's definition of \"proceeds\" were applied in this case.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO and Justice BREYER suggest that the advisory nature of the Guidelines post-<i>Booker, </i><i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), or the possibility of an amendment to the money laundering Guideline, would soften this blow, <i>post,</i> at 2044-2045 (opinion of ALITO, J.); <i>post,</i> at 2034-2035 (opinion of BREYER, J.), and indeed they could. But the result in the case at hand might not be softened at all by resort to <i>Booker</i> because respondents' direct appeal was decided in 2000, several years prior to our decision in <i>Booker.</i> If Justice ALITO's opinion were to carry the day, both respondents would return to prison to serve the remainder of their lengthy sentences.</p>\n<p>The revenue generated by a gambling business that is used to pay the essential expenses of operating that business is not \"proceeds\" within the meaning of the money laundering statute. As the plurality notes, there is \"no explanation for why Congress would have wanted a transaction that is a normal part of a crime it had duly considered and appropriately punished elsewhere in the Criminal Code, to radically increase the sentence for that crime.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2027. This conclusion dovetails with what common sense and the rule of lenity would require. Faced with both a lack of legislative history speaking to the definition of \"proceeds\" when operating a gambling business is the \"specified unlawful activity\" and my conviction that Congress could not have intended the perverse result that would obtain in this case under Justice ALITO's opinion, the rule of lenity may weigh in the determination. And in that respect the plurality's opinion is surely <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2034</span> persuasive.<sup>[7]</sup> Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I join Justice ALITO's dissent while adding the following observations about what has been referred to as the \"`merger problem.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2026 (plurality opinion). Like the plurality, I doubt that Congress intended the money laundering statute automatically to cover financial transactions that constitute an essential part of a different underlying crime. Operating an illegal gambling business, for example, inevitably involves investment in overhead as well as payments to employees and winning customers; a drug offense normally involves payment for drugs; and bank robbery may well require the distribution of stolen cash to confederates. If the money laundering statute applies to this kind of transaction (<i>i.e.,</i> if the transaction is automatically a \"financial transaction\" that \"involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity\" made \"with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\"), then the Government can seek a heavier money laundering penalty (say, 20 years), even though the only conduct at issue is conduct that warranted a lighter penalty (say, 5 years for illegal gambling). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1).</p>\n<p>It is difficult to understand why Congress would have intended the Government to possess this punishment-transforming power. Perhaps for this reason, the Tenth Circuit has written that \"Congress aimed the crime of money laundering at conduct that follows in time the underlying crime rather than to afford an alternative means of punishing the prior `specified unlawful activity.'\" <i>United States v. Edgmon,</i> 952 F.2d 1206, 1214 (1991). And, in 1997, the United States Sentencing Commission told Congress that it agreed with the Department of Justice that \"money laundering cannot properly be charged for `merged' transactions that are part of the underlying crime.\" Report to Congress: Sentencing Policy for Money Laundering Offenses, including Comments on a Dept. of Justice Report, p. 16 (Sept. 1997), online at http:// www.ussc.gov/r_congress/launder.pdf (as visited May 20, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).</p>\n<p>Thus, like the plurality, I see a \"merger\" problem. But, unlike the plurality, I do not believe that we should look to the word \"proceeds\" for a solution. For one thing, the plurality's interpretation of that word creates the serious logical and practical difficulties that Justice ALITO describes. See <i>post,</i> at 2038-2041 (dissenting opinion) (describing difficulties associated with proof and accounting). For another thing, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2035</span> there are other, more legally felicitous places to look for a solution. The Tenth Circuit, for example, has simply held that the money laundering offense and the underlying offense that generated the money to be laundered must be distinct in order to be separately punishable. <i>Edgmon, supra,</i> at 1214. Alternatively the money laundering statute's phrase \"with the intent <i>to promote</i> the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\" may not apply where, for example, only one instance of that underlying activity is at issue. (The Seventh Circuit on a prior appeal in this case rejected that argument, and thus we do not consider it here. See <i>United States v. Febus,</i> 218 F.3d 784, 789 (2000).)</p>\n<p>Finally, if the \"merger\" problem is essentially a problem of fairness in sentencing, the Sentencing Commission has adequate authority to address it. Congress has instructed the Commission to \"avoi[d] unwarranted sentencing disparities\" among those \"found guilty of <i>similar criminal conduct.</i>\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991(b)(1)(B) (emphasis added); see also \u00a7 994(f) (instructing the Commission to pay particular attention to those disparities). The current money laundering Guideline, United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2S1.1 (Nov. 2007) (USSG), by making no exception for a situation where <i>nothing but a single instance of the underlying crime has taken place,</i> would seem to create a serious and unwarranted disparity among defendants who have engaged in identical conduct. My hope is that the Commission's past efforts to tie more closely the offense level for money laundering to the offense level of the underlying crime, see <i>id.,</i> Supp. to App. C, Amdt. 634 (Nov.2001), suggest a willingness to consider directly this kind of disparity. Such an approach could solve the \"merger\" problem without resort to creating complex interpretations of the statute's language. And any such solution could be applied retroactively. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(u).</p>\n<p>In light of these alternative possibilities, I dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice KENNEDY, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Fairly read, the term \"proceeds,\" as used in the principal federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a), means \"the total amount brought in,\" the primary dictionary definition. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1807 (1976) (hereinafter Webster's 3d). See also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1542 (2d ed.1987) (\"the total sum derived from a sale or other transaction\"). The plurality opinion, however, makes no serious effort to interpret this important statutory term. Ignoring the context in which the term is used, the problems that the money laundering statute was enacted to address, and the obvious practical considerations that those responsible for drafting the statute almost certainly had in mind, that opinion is quick to pronounce the term hopelessly ambiguous and thus to invoke the rule of lenity. Concluding that \"proceeds\" means \"profits,\" the plurality opinion's interpretation would frustrate Congress' intent and maim a statute that was enacted as an important defense against organized criminal enterprises.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Justice STEVENS's opinion recognizes that the term \"proceeds\" \"include[s] gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2023-2024 (opinion concurring in judgment).<sup>[1]</sup> I cannot agree with Justice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2036</span> STEVENS's approach insofar as it holds that the meaning of the term \"proceeds\" varies depending on the nature of the illegal activity that produces the laundered funds, but at least that approach preserves the correct interpretation of the statute in most of the cases that were the focus of congressional concern when the money laundering statute was enacted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>While the primary definition of the term \"proceeds\" is \"the total amount brought in,\" I recognize that the term may also be used to mean \"net profit,\" Webster's 3d 1807, and I do not suggest that the question presented in this case can be answered simply by opening a dictionary. When a word has more than one meaning, the meaning that is intended is often made clear by the context in which the word is used, and thus in this case, upon finding that the term \"proceeds\" may mean both \"the total amount brought in\" and \"net profit,\" the appropriate next step is not to abandon any effort at interpretation and summon in the rule of lenity. Rather, the next thing to do is to ask what the term \"proceeds\" customarily means in the context that is relevant here\u0097a money laundering statute.</p>\n<p>The federal money laundering statute is not the only money laundering provision that uses the term \"proceeds.\" On the contrary, the term is a staple of money laundering laws, and it is instructive that in every single one of these provisions in which the term \"proceeds\" is defined\u0097and there are many\u0097the law specifies that \"proceeds\" means \"the total amount brought in.\"</p>\n<p>The leading treaty on international money laundering, the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (Convention), Nov. 15, 2000, 2225 U.N.T.S. 209 (Treaty No. I-39574), which has been adopted by the United States and 146 other countries,<sup>[2]</sup> is instructive. This treaty contains a provision that is very similar to \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)(i). Article 6.1 of the Convention obligates signatory nations to criminalize \"[t]he ... transfer of property, knowing that such property is <i>the proceeds of crime,</i> for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or of helping any person who is involved in the commission of the predicate offence to evade the legal consequences of his or her action.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 277 (emphasis added). The Convention defines the term \"proceeds\" to mean \"any property derived from or obtained, directly or indirectly, through the commission of an offence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 275 (Art. 2(e)). The money laundering provision of the Convention thus covers gross receipts.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2037</span> The term \"proceeds\" is given a similarly broad scope in the Model Money Laundering Act (Model Act). See President's Commission on Model State Drug Laws, Economic Remedies, \u00a7 C (1993). Section 5(a)(1) of the Model Act criminalizes transactions involving property that is \"the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,\" and the Model Act defines \"proceeds\" as \"property acquired or derived directly or indirectly from, produced through, realized through, or caused by an act or omission... includ[ing] any property of any kind,\" \u00a7 4(a).</p>\n<p>Fourteen States have money laundering statutes that define the term \"proceeds,\" and in every one of these laws the term is defined in a way that encompasses gross receipts. See Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 13-2314(N)(3) (West 2001), 13-2317(F)(4)(b) (West Supp.2007); Ark.Code Ann. \u00a7 5-42-203(5) (2006); Cal.

It strongly suggests that when lawmakers, knowledgeable about the nature and problem of money laundering, use the term \"proceeds\" in a money laundering provision, they customarily mean for the term to reach all receipts and not just profits.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2038</span> B</h2>\n<p>There is a very good reason for this uniform pattern of usage. Money laundering provisions serve two chief ends. First, they provide deterrence by preventing drug traffickers and other criminals who amass large quantities of cash from using these funds \"to support a luxurious lifestyle\" or otherwise to enjoy the fruits of their crimes. Model Act, Policy Statement, p. C-105. See President's Commission on Organized Crime, Interim Report to President and Attorney General, The Cash Connection: Organized Crime, Financial Institutions, and Money Laundering 7-8 (Oct.1984) (hereinafter Interim Report); Aranson, Bouker, &amp; Hannon, Money Laundering, 31 Am.Crim. L.Rev. 721, 721-722 (1994); H.R.Rep. No. 99-746, p. 16 (1986) (hereinafter H.R. Rep.). Second, they inhibit the growth of criminal enterprises by preventing the use of dirty money to promote the enterprise's growth. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), (a)(2)(A), and (a)(3)(A); Model Act \u00a7\u00a7 5(a)(2), (4); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:21-25(b)(1); Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 34.02(a)(3)(4).</p>\n<p>Both of these objectives are frustrated if a money laundering statute is limited to profits. Dirty money may be used to support \"a luxurious lifestyle\" and to grow an illegal enterprise whenever the enterprise possesses large amounts of illegally obtained cash. And illegal enterprises may acquire such cash while engaging in unlawful activity that is unprofitable.</p>\n<p>Suppose, for example, that a drug cartel sends a large shipment of drugs to this country, a good part of the shipment is intercepted, the remainder is sold, the cartel ends up with a net loss but with a large quantity of cash on its hands, and the cartel uses the cash in financial transactions that are designed to conceal the source of the cash or to promote further crime. There is no plausible reason why Congress would not have wanted the money laundering statute to apply to these financial transactions. If the cartel leaders use the money to live in luxury, this provides an incentive for these individuals to stay in the business and for others to enter. If the cartel uses the money to finance future drug shipments or to expand the business, public safety is harmed.</p>\n<p>It is certainly true that Congress, in enacting the federal money laundering statute, was primarily concerned about criminal enterprises that realize profits. A criminal operation that consistently loses money will not last very long and thus presents a lesser danger than a profitable operation. But narrowing a money laundering statute so that it reaches only profits produces two perverse results that Congress cannot have wanted. First, it immunizes successful criminal enterprises during those periods when they are operating temporarily in the red. Second, and more important, it introduces pointless and difficult problems of proof. Because the dangers presented by money laundering are present whenever criminals have large stores of illegally derived funds on their hands, there is little reason to require proof\u0097which may be harder to assemble than the plurality opinion acknowledges\u0097 that the funds represent profits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The implausibility of a net income interpretation is highlighted in cases involving professionals and others who are hired to launder money. Those who are knowledgeable about money laundering stress the importance of prosecuting these hired money launderers. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Depts. of Treasury and Justice, The 2001 National Money Laundering Strategy, pp. ix-x, 1-2 (Sept.2001), online at http://www.treas.gov/ press/releases/docs/ml2001.pdf; Financial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2039</span> Action Task Force on Money Laundering, 1996-1997 Report on Money Laundering Typologies 7 (Feb.1997), online at http:// www.fatf-gafi.org/dataoecd/31/29/ 34043795.pdf; Butterworths International Guide to Money Laundering Law and Practice 629 (T. Graham 2d ed.2003); Ratliff, Third Party Money Laundering: Problems of Proof and Prosecutorial Discretion, 7 Stan. L. &amp; Policy Rev. 173 (1996); Sultzer, Money Laundering: The Scope of the Problem and Attempts to Combat It, 63 Tenn. L.Rev. 143, 147-148 (1995); H. R. Rep., at 16-17.</p>\n<p>A net income interpretation would risk hamstringing such prosecutions. To violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a), a defendant must \"kno[w] the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity.\" A professional money launderer is not likely to know (or perhaps even to care) whether the enterprise is operating in the black when the funds in question were acquired. Therefore, under a net income interpretation, financial specialists and others who are hired to launder funds would generally be beyond the reach of the statute, something that Congress almost certainly did not intend.</p>\n<p>It is revealing that the money laundering statute explicitly provides that a money launderer need only know that \"the property involved in the transaction represented proceeds from some form, though not necessarily which form, of [specified illegal] activity.\" \u00a7 1956(c)(1). Thus, the prosecution is not required to prove that a hired money launderer knew that funds provided for laundering derived from, say, drug sales as opposed to gambling. There is no reason to think that hired money launderers are more likely to know whether funds include profits than they are to know the nature of the illegal activity from which the funds were derived. Consequently, \u00a7 1956(c) suggests that Congress did not intend to require proof that a hired money launderer knew that funds provided for laundering included profits.</p>\n<p>The plurality opinion dismisses these concerns with the observation that a jury may infer that a hired launderer knew that funds included profits if the launderer had a long-running relationship with the entity or person providing the funds or knew that the entity or person had been involved in the illegal enterprise for a lengthy period. See <i>ante,</i> at 2029-2030. But what about the case where the launderer accepts a million dollars of drug money on a single occasion? And even if there would be legally sufficient evidence to support an inference of the requisite knowledge under the circumstances that the plurality opinion posits, the requirement of convincing a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the funds included profits would pose a troublesome and (in light of the aim of the money laundering statute) pointless obstacle.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>Even in cases in which the defendants are alleged to have been involved in the underlying criminal activity, a net income interpretation would produce nettlesome problems that Congress cannot have wanted. These problems may be especially acute in the very cases that money laundering statutes principally target, that is, cases involving large-scale criminal operations that continue over a substantial period of time, particularly drug cartels and other organized crime syndicates.</p>\n<p>The federal money laundering statute was enacted in the wake of an influential report by the President's Commission on Organized Crime that focused squarely on criminal enterprises of this type. See Interim Report 7-8 (described in S.Rep. No. 99-433, pp. 2-4 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2040</span> and H.R. Rep., at 16). The Commission identified drug traffickers and other organized criminal groups as presenting the most serious problems. See Interim Report 7. The Commission found that \"narcotics traffickers, who must conceal billions of dollars in cash from detection by the government, create by far the greatest demand for money laundering services\" but that \"numerous other types of activities typical of organized crime, such as loansharking and gambling, also create an appreciable demand for such schemes.\" <i>Ibid.</i> To illustrate the scope and nature of the money laundering problem, a section of the Interim Report was devoted to case studies, most of which involved the laundering of drug money. <i>Id.,</i> at 29-49.</p>\n<p>As a prime example of the problem of money laundering, the report discussed the so-called \"Pizza Connection\" case that was prosecuted in federal court in New York City in the 1980's. In that case, the evidence showed that the Sicilian Mafia and organized crime elements in the United States, over a period of many years, imported huge amounts of heroin into this country, sold the heroin here, accumulated millions of dollars of cash, and then laundered the funds by smuggling them overseas in suitcases or funneling the money through a maze of bank accounts. See <i>id.,</i> at 31-35; <i>United States v. Casamento,</i> 887 F.2d 1141, 1148-1149 (C.A.2 1989).</p>\n<p>Following the issuance of the Interim Report, Congress turned its attention to the problem of money laundering, and much of the discussion focused on the need to prevent laundering by drug and organized crime syndicates. See, <i>e.g.,</i> S. Rep., at 3 (discussing \"organized crime `businesses' such as gambling, prostitution, and loansharking\"), 4 (\"Money laundering is a crucial financial underpinning of organized crime and narcotics trafficking\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Hearing on Money Laundering Legislation before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 99th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1985) (statement of Chairman Thurmond); <i>id.,</i> at 29 (statement of Sen. Biden), 30 (statement of Sen. DeConcini), 31 (statement of Sen. D'Amato), 53 (statement of Assistant Attorney General Trott).</p>\n<p>In light of these concerns, it is most unlikely that Congress meant to enact a money laundering statute that would present daunting obstacles in the very sort of cases that had been identified as presenting the most pressing problems, that is, cases, like the \"Pizza Connection\" case, in which law enforcement intercepts cash or wire transfers of funds derived from drug sales or other unlawful activity that occurred over a period of time. The plurality opinion's interpretation of the term \"proceeds,\" however, would often produce such problems. Tracing funds back to particular drug sales and proving that these sales were profitable will often prove impossible. See <i>United States v. Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. 321, 351-352, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Indeed, it will often be hard even to establish with any precision the period of time during which the drug sales occurred. But assuming that the Government can prove roughly when the funds were acquired, the next hurdle would be to show that the drug ring had net income during the time when the funds were acquired.</p>\n<p>\"Net income\" means \"[t]he excess of revenues over all related expenses for a given period.\" R. Estes, Dictionary of Accounting 88 (1981) (emphasis deleted). There are no generally accepted accounting principles for determining the net income of illegal enterprises, and therefore, in order to apply a net income interpretation, special accounting rules would have to be developed.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2041</span> In the drug-money cases that I have been discussing, the courts would have to decide whether the drug syndicate's net income should be calculated on an annual, quarterly, or some other basis. In addition, the courts would be forced to devise rules for determining the scope of the enterprise for which the net income calculation must be performed. Suppose, for example, that there were connections of an uncertain nature or degree between drug operations in different cities or countries. Rules would be needed to determine whether affiliated criminal groups should be regarded as one enterprise or several. And proof regarding the connections between such operations would often be very difficult to obtain. Criminal enterprises do not have papers of incorporation, partnership agreements, or (in most instances) other documents establishing precise business relationships.</p>\n<p>Rules would also be needed in order to determine whether particular illegal expenditures should be considered as expenses. In the \"Pizza Connection\" case, the Sicilian Mafia used its income for such things as the murder of magistrates, police officers, witnesses, and rivals. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Casamento, supra,</i> at 1154-1156; <i>United States v. Gambino,</i> 809 F.Supp. 1061, 1065-1068 (S.D.N.Y.1992). Are these expenditures simply a cost of engaging in the drug trade? Are they business expenses?</p>\n<p>If a net income interpretation were taken to its logical conclusion, it presumably would be necessary as well to work out rules for the depreciation of instrumentalities of crime that must occasionally be replaced due to the efforts of law enforcement. But it seems quite implausible that Congress wanted courts or juries in money laundering cases to grapple with questions such as the useful life of, say, a drug processing plant or laboratory or the airplanes and boats that are used to smuggle drugs. And assuming that the accounting issues can ultimately be resolved by the courts, there would remain serious problems of proof. Illegal enterprises generally do not keep books and records like legitimate businesses do.</p>\n<p>It is tempting to dismiss many of the problems noted above on the ground that \"everyone knows\" that drug cartels, organized crime syndicates, and the like make a profit. But such groups may not operate in the black at all times, and in any event, if net income is an element of the money laundering offense, the prosecution must prove net income beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution cannot simply ask the jury to take notice of the fact that these groups are profitable.</p>\n<p>My point in citing the accounting and proof problems that would be produced by a net income interpretation is not that the \"`receipts'\" interpretation is preferable because \"it is easier to prosecute,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2028 (plurality opinion), but that creating these obstacles would serve no discernible purpose. Even if a drug or gambling ring was temporarily operating in the red during a particular period, the laundering of money acquired during that time would present the same dangers as the laundering of money acquired during times of profit. It is therefore implausible that Congress wanted to throw up such pointless obstacles.</p>\n<p>The plurality opinion attempts to minimize all these problems by stating that \"to establish the proceeds element under the `profits' interpretation, the prosecution needs to show only that a single instance of specified unlawful activity was profitable and gave rise to the money involved in a charged transaction.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2029. This suggestion ignores both the language of the money laundering statute, which makes no reference to an \"instance\" of unlawful activity, and the realities of money <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2042</span> laundering prosecutions. The prototypical money laundering case is not a case in which a defendant engages in a single, discrete criminal act and then launders the money derived from that act\u0097for example, a case in which a \"felon ... uses ... stolen money to pay for the rented getaway car.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2026. Rather, the prototypical case involves numerous criminal acts that occur over a period of time and the accumulation of funds from all these acts prior to laundering\u0097for example, the organized crime syndicate or drug cartel that amasses large sums before engaging in a laundering transaction.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, a case in which a defendant is charged with doing what was done in the \"Pizza Connection\" case\u0097 transferring millions of dollars of drug money overseas, knowing that the funds represent the proceeds of drug trafficking (\"some form of unlawful activity\") and that the transfer was designed to conceal the origin of the funds. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(2). In such a case, it is unrealistic to think that individual dollars can be traced back to individual drug sales\u0097or that Congress wanted to require such tracing.</p>\n<p>Although the plurality opinion begins by touting the \"single instance\" theory as a cure for the accounting and proof problems that a \"profits\" interpretation produces, the plurality's application of the \"single instance\" theory to the case at hand shows that this theory will not work. In this case, the \"unlawful activity\" that produced the funds at issue in the substantive money laundering counts was the operation of the Santos lottery,<sup>[6]</sup> and it is hardly apparent what constitutes a \"single instance\" of running a gambling business. Did each lottery drawing represent a separate \"instance\"? Each wager? And how long does each gambling \"instance\" last? A day? A week? A month?</p>\n<p>When the plurality opinion addresses these questions, it turns out that \"a single instance\" means all instances that are charged, <i>i.e.,</i> it means that the Government had to show that receipts exceeded costs during the time the defendant allegedly conducted, financed, etc., the gambling operation. See <i>ante,</i> at 2029, n. 7. Here, since the Indictment alleged that the Santos lottery continued for more than 6 years (\"[b]egining in or about January 1989 and continuing to in or about December 1994, the exact dates being unknown to the Grand Jury\"),<sup>[7]</sup> the plurality would apparently compel the Government to prove that the lottery was profitable over this entire period.</p>\n<p>If this is where the \"single instance\" theory leads, the theory plainly does not solve the accounting and proof problems we have noted. And the plurality's suggestion that the Government had to show that the gambling operation was profitable for this entire period leads to preposterous results. Suppose that the lottery was profitable for the first five years and, at the end of each year, respondents laundered funds derived from the business. Suppose that in the sixth year the business incurred heavy losses\u0097losses so heavy that they wiped out all of the profits from the first five years. According to the plurality, if respondents were found to have operated the lottery during the entire 6-year period, then the financial transactions that occurred at the end of years one, two, three, four, and five would not violate the money laundering statute, even though an accounting done at those times would have come to the conclusion that the funds included <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2043</span> profits. That result makes no sense.</p>\n<p>Whenever a money laundering indictment charges that the laundered funds derived from an \"unlawful activity\" that comprehends numerous acts that occurred over a considerable period of time\u0097and that is precisely the situation in many of the types of cases that the money laundering statute principally targeted\u0097the plurality opinion's interpretation will produce difficulties. I have already discussed drug and gambling cases, and similar problems will arise in cases in which the unlawful activity is a form of fraud. For example, the unlawful activity in mail fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) is the scheme to defraud, not the individual mailings carried out in furtherance of the scheme. See <i>Neder v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 1, 19, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999); <i>United States v. Mankarious,</i> 151 F.3d 694 (C.A.7 1998). In such a case, what will constitute the \"single instance of unlawful activity\"? Will each mailing be a separate \"instance\"? The same problem arises with other fraud predicates, including wire fraud (\u00a7 1343), see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Zvi,</i> 168 F.3d 49 (C.A.2 1999), and financial institution fraud (\u00a7 1344), see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Farr,</i> 69 F.3d 545 (C.A.9 1995).</p>\n<p>The plurality opinion suggests that the application of a profits interpretation will be easy in cases in which the financial transactions are payments of \"expenses.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2027. But it may be no small matter to determine whether particular payments are for \"expenses.\" When the manager of a gambling operation distributes cash to those who work in the operation, the manager may be paying them the rough equivalent of a salary; that is, the recipients may expect to receive a certain amount for their services whether or not the operation is profitable. On the other hand, those who work in the operation may have the expectation of receiving a certain percentage of the gross revenue (perhaps even in addition to a salary), in which case their distribution may include profits. Such was the case in Santos' lottery, where the runners were paid a percentage of gross revenue. See Indictment 5; 16 Tr. 1399 (Oct. 9, 1997).</p>\n<p>The plurality opinion cites 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(a) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a), for the proposition that Congress has \"elsewhere\" imposed the burden of proving that illegally obtained funds represent profits, but the plurality opinion's examples are inapposite. <i>Ante,</i> at 2028-2029. Neither of these provisions, however, requires a determination of net income. Both provisions permit a fine in the amount of \"not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(a). Thus, the term \"proceeds\" as used in these provisions is not limited to profits.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2044</span> For all these reasons, I am convinced that the term \"proceeds\" in the money laundering statute means gross receipts, not net income. And contrary to the approach taken by Justice STEVENS, I do not see how the meaning of the term \"proceeds\" can vary depending on the nature of the illegal activity that produced the laundered funds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>It is apparent that a chief reason for interpreting the term \"proceeds\" to mean net income in all money laundering cases (the approach taken in the plurality opinion) or in some money laundering cases (the approach taken by Justice STEVENS) is the desire to avoid a \"merger\" problem in gambling cases\u0097that is, to avoid an interpretation that would mean that every violation of \u00a7 1955 (conducting an illegal gambling business) would also constitute a violation of the money laundering statute, which carries a much higher maximum penalty (20 as opposed to 5 years' imprisonment). This concern is misplaced and provides no justification for hobbling a statute that applies to more than 250 predicate offenses and not just running an illegal gambling business.</p>\n<p>First, the so-called merger problem is fundamentally a sentencing problem, and the proper remedy is a sentencing remedy. While it is true that the money laundering statute has a higher maximum sentence than the gambling business statute, neither statute has a mandatory minimum. Thus, these statutes do not require a judge to increase a defendant's sentence simply because the defendant was convicted of money laundering as well as running a gambling business. When the respondents were convicted, their money laundering convictions resulted in higher sentences only because of the money laundering Sentencing Guideline, United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2S1.1 (Nov.1997) (USSG), which, in the pre-<i>Booker</i><sup>[9]</sup> era, was mandatory. I agree with Justice BREYER, <i>ante,</i> at 2034-2035 (dissenting opinion), that if a defendant is convicted of money laundering for doing no more than is required for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955, the defendant's sentence should be no higher than it would have been if the defendant had violated only that latter provision. Insofar as the Guidelines previously required\u0097and now advise in favor of\u0097a stiffer sentence, the obvious remedy is an amendment of the money laundering Guideline. And of course, now that the Guidelines are no longer mandatory, a sentencing judge could impose the sentence called for by the Guideline that applies to the gambling business provision, see USSG \u00a7 2E3.1(a)(1) (Nov.2007), or an entirely different sentence.</p>\n<p>Second, the merger problem that the plurality opinion and Justice STEVENS seek to avoid assumes the correctness of the interpretation of the promotion prong of the money laundering statute that the Seventh Circuit adopted in Santos' direct appeal, <i>i.e.,</i> that a defendant \"promotes\" an illegal gambling business by doing those things, such as paying employees and winning bettors, that are needed merely to keep the business running. As Santos' brief puts it, the merger problem arises when the interpretation of \"proceeds\" as gross receipts is \"[c]ombined with the Government's broad application of the `promotion' prong of the money laundering statute.\" Brief for Respondent 6. But the meaning of the element of promotion is not before us in this case, and it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2045</span> would not make sense to allow our interpretation of \"proceeds\" to be dictated by an unreviewed interpretation of another statutory element.</p>\n<p>Third, even if there is a merger problem, it occurs in only a subset of money laundering cases. The money laundering statute reaches financial transactions that are intended to promote more than 250 other crimes, <i>ante,</i> at 2027 (plurality opinion), as well as transactions that are intended to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of illegally obtained funds. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a). The meaning of the term \"proceeds\" cannot vary from one money laundering case to the next, and the plurality opinion and Justice STEVENS inappropriately allow the interpretation of that term to be controlled by a problem that may arise in only a subset of cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The plurality opinion defends its interpretation by invoking the rule of lenity, but the rule of lenity does not require us to put aside the usual tools of statutory interpretation or to adopt the narrowest possible dictionary definition of the terms in a criminal statute. On the contrary, \"[b]ecause the meaning of language is inherently contextual, we have declined to deem a statute `ambiguous' for purposes of lenity merely because it was <i>possible</i> to articulate a construction more narrow than that urged by the Government.\" <i>Moskal v. United States,</i> 498 U.S. 103, 108, 111 S.Ct. 461, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990) (citing <i>McElroy v. United States,</i> 455 U.S. 642, 657-658, 102 S.Ct. 1332, 71 L.Ed.2d 522 (1982)). As I have explained above, the meaning of \"proceeds\" in the money laundering statute emerges with reasonable clarity when the term is viewed in context, making the rule of lenity inapplicable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 1956(a)(1) reads as follows: \"Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity ... (A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity ... shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both.\"\n</p>\n<p>Respondents were also convicted of conspiring to launder money under \u00a7 1956(h). Because the Government has not argued that respondents' conspiracy convictions could stand if \"proceeds\" meant \"profits,\" see 461 F.3d 886, 889 (CA7 2006), we do not address that possibility.</p>\n<p>[2]  The majority of States with money-laundering laws, in fact, use \"proceeds\" <i>without defining it.</i> See Colo.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 18-18-408 (2007); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 896.101 (2006); Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 7-1-911, 7-1-915 (2004); Idaho Code \u00a7 18-8201 (Lexis 2004); Ill. Comp.

Courts in these States have not construed the term one way or the other. But cf. <i>State v. Jackson,</i> 124 S.W.3d 139, 143 (Tenn.Crim.App. 2003) (linking \"proceeds\" with the defined term \"property\"). California might belong in this list, for it has a money-laundering provision in its Penal Code, in which it uses the term \"proceeds\" but does not define it. See Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 186.10 (West 1999). But California also has a more limited money-laundering statute that uses and defines \"proceeds.\" See Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 11370.9(h)(1) (West 2007). Maryland might belong on the list as well: Its general money-laundering statute defines \"proceeds\" simply to set a minimum value on the proceeds laundered, Md.Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 5-623(a)(5) (Lexis 2002) (\"money or any other property with a value exceeding $10,000\"), and its more limited money-laundering statute does not define the term, see \u00a7 11-304.</p>\n<p>[3]  The principal dissent also suggests that Congress thought \"proceeds\" meant \"receipts\" because the House of Representatives (but not the Senate) had passed a money-laundering bill that did not use the word \"proceeds\" but rather used and defined a term (\"criminally derived property\") that, perhaps, included receipts. See <i>post,</i> at 2037, n. 5. Putting aside the question whether resort to legislative history is ever appropriate when interpreting a criminal statute, compare <i>United States v. R.L. C.,</i> 503 U.S. 291, 306, n. 6, 112 S.Ct. 1329, 117 L.Ed.2d 559 (1992), with <i>id.,</i> at 307, 112 S.Ct. 1329 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), that bit of it is totally unenlightening because we do not know why the earlier House terminology was rejected\u0097because \"proceeds\" captured the same meaning, or because \"proceeds\" carried a narrower meaning?</p>\n<p>[4]  The Solicitor General suggests that this is the case even under the \"profits\" interpretation. See Reply Brief for United States 16; see also <i>post,</i> at 2042-2043 (ALITO, J., dissenting). That is not so, because when the \"loot\" comes into the hands of the later distributing felon his confederates' shares are (as to him) not profits but mere receipts subject to his payment of expenses.</p>\n<p>[5]  We note in passing the peculiarity that a dissent which rejects our interpretation of \"proceeds\" because knowledge of profits will be difficult to prove, suggests an interpretation of \"promotes\" that will require proving that a particular expenditure was intended, not merely to keep a business \"running,\" but to expand it. (\"You must decide, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, whether it is true beyond a reasonable doubt that the payoff of this winning bettor was not simply motivated by a desire to bring him and other current gambling customers back, but was meant to create a reputation for reliable payoff that would attract future customers.\")</p>\n<p>[6]  The principal dissent claims that these statutes do not require proof of profits because the Government could rely upon the \"other proceeds\" prong, which the dissent interprets to mean <i>all</i> proceeds, gross profits and everything else. See <i>post,</i> at 2043. We do not normally interpret a text in a manner that makes one of its provisions superfluous. But even if we did, these provisions would still establish what the dissent believes unthinkable: that Congress could envision the Government's proving profits.</p>\n<p>[7]  The principal dissent asks, \"[H]ow long does each gambling `instance' last?\" <i>Post,</i> at 2042. The answer is \"as long as the Government chooses to charge.\" Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955(a) provides that \"[w]hoever conducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an illegal gambling business shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\" An illegal gambling business is an illegal gambling business during each moment of its operation, and it will be up to the Government to select that period of time for which it can most readily establish the necessary elements of the charged offenses, including (if money laundering is one of them) profitability. (To the extent this raises the possibility of the Government's making multiple violations out of one person's running of a single business, that problem arises no matter what definition of \"proceeds\" is adopted.) The \"preposterous results\" that the dissent attributes to our interpretation of \"proceeds,\" <i>post,</i> at 2042, are in fact the consequence of the Government's decision to charge Santos with conducting a gambling business over a 6-year period. Of course in the vast majority of cases, establishing the profitability of the predicate offense will not put the Government to the task of identifying the relevant period. Most criminal statutes prohibit discrete, individual acts (fraud, bank robbery) rather than the conduct of a business.</p>\n<p>[8]  Justice STEVENS fails to identify the legislative history to which he refers. He offers only: \"As Justice ALITO rightly argues, the legislative history of \u00a7 1956 makes it clear that Congress intended the term `proceeds' to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2035-2036. Although Justice ALITO, from one item of legislative history, draws an inference about the meaning of \"proceeds\" in all its applications (which we find dubious, see n. 3, <i>supra</i>), nowhere does he cite legislative history addressing the meaning of the word \"proceeds\" in cases specifically involving contraband or organized crime. Thus Justice STEVENS' concurrence appears to address not only a hypothetical case, see <i>infra,</i> at 2030, but even an imagined legislative history.</p>\n<p>[1]  For example, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339C(e)(3) (2000 ed., Supp. V), which prohibits the concealment of proceeds derived from funds used to support terrorism, defines \"proceeds\" to mean \"any funds derived from or obtained, directly or indirectly, through the commission of [the] offense.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  See, <i>e.g., </i><i>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline,</i> 540 U.S. 581, 595, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004) (rejecting the presumption that the term \"age\" had an identical meaning throughout the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967).</p>\n<p>[3]  Thus, I cannot agree with the plurality that the rule of lenity must apply to the definition of \"proceeds\" for these types of unlawful activities.</p>\n<p>[4]  As Justice ALITO notes, some reference was made in the legislative history to gambling as a part of a broader criminal syndicate's activities. <i>Post,</i> at 2040. But that reference does not indicate that Congress intended the \"proceeds\" of a gambling business to include gross receipts.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Seventh Circuit held on a prior appeal that respondent Santos' actions were legally sufficient to convict him of promoting the carrying on of a business under \u00a7 1956, <i>United States v. Febus,</i> 218 F.3d 784, 789-790 (2000). Justice ALITO criticizes the plurality for allowing the interpretation of \"proceeds\" to be \"dictated by an unreviewed interpretation of another statutory element.\" See <i>post,</i> at 2044-2045. I do not base my opinion on any disagreement with the interpretation of \"promotion.\"</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, under the 2007 Guidelines, the base offense level for running a gambling business is 12. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2E3.1 (Nov.2007) (USSG). Section 2S1.1, which provides the base offense level for money laundering, adds 2 levels to the base offense level for the underlying crime where the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956. This scheme for determining the base offense level first appeared in the November 2001 Sentencing Guidelines. Prior to 2001, the difference between sentences for gambling and money laundering was even more pronounced, as USSG \u00a7 2S1.1 (Nov.2000) set an offense level of 23, which could be increased if the value of the funds exceeded $100,000.</p>\n<p>[7]  In what can only be characterized as the \"purest of dicta,\" the plurality speculates about the <i>stare decisis</i> effect of our judgment and interprets my conclusion as resting on the ground that \"`proceeds' means `profits' when there is no legislative history to the contrary.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2031. That is not correct; my conclusion rests on my conviction that Congress could not have intended the perverse result that the dissent's rule would produce if its definition of \"proceeds\" were applied to the operation of an unlicensed gambling business. In other applications of the statute not involving such a perverse result, I would presume that the legislative history summarized by Justice ALITO reflects the intent of the enacting Congress. See <i>post,</i> at 2035-2036 and n. 1 (opinion of ALITO, J.). Its decision to leave the term undefined is consistent with my view that \"proceeds\" need not be given the same definition when applied to each of the numerous specified unlawful activities that produce unclean money. <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U.S. 371, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005), poses no barrier to this conclusion. In <i>Martinez</i> there was no compelling reason\u0097in stark contrast to the situation here\u0097to believe that Congress intended the result for which the Government argued.</p>\n<p>[1]  In light of the plurality opinion's discussion of \"the <i>stare decisis</i> effect of Justice STEVENS' opinion,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2031, it must be noted that five Justices agree with the position taken by Justice STEVENS on the matter discussed in the preceding sentence of the text.</p>\n<p>[2]  See Multilateral Treaties Deposited with the Secretary-General, pt. I, ch. XVIII, No. 12, United Nations Convention against Transnational Crime (Nov. 15, 2007), online at http://untreaty.un.org/ ENGLISH / bible / englishinternetbible / partI /chapterXVIII/ treaty13.asp (all Internet materials as visited May 29, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).</p>\n<p>[3]  If 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 were limited to profits, it would be narrower than the obligation that the United States undertook in Article 6.1 of the Convention, but the Department of State has taken the position that no new legislation is needed to bring the United States into compliance. See Hearing on Law Enforcement Treaties before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (2004) (statement of Samuel M. Witten, Deputy Legal Adviser (\"[W]e can comply with the Convention's criminalization obligations without the need for new legislation\")).</p>\n<p>[4]  Connecticut, the only State with a money laundering statute that does not use the term \"proceeds,\" uses equivalent language that is not limited to profits. See Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 53a-276 (2005) (\"A person is guilty for money laundering in the first degree when he exchanges ... one or more monetary instruments derived from criminal conduct constituting a felony\"). I have found no money laundering statute that defines \"proceeds\" to mean profits or that uses other language that limits the law's reach to profits or net income.\n</p>\n<p>The only state money laundering statute the even uses the term \"profits,\" \"net income,\" or something similar is that of Arkansas, which plainly defines \"criminal proceeds\" to include all gross receipts of criminal conduct: \"`Criminal proceeds' means: (A) Anything of value furnished or intended to be furnished in exchange for criminal conduct or contraband received in violation of state or federal law; and (B) Property or profits traceable to\" such an exchange. Ark.Code Ann. \u00a7 5-42-203(5) (2006).</p>\n<p>[5]  The version of the money laundering statute originally passed by the House reflected a similar legislative judgment. The bill made it a crime to engage in financial transactions and certain commercial transactions involving \"criminally derived property that is derived from a designated offense.\" H.R. 5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 602, p. 154 (1986) (as introduced). The term \"criminally derived property\" is naturally understood to include all property that is \"receive[d]\" or \"obtain[ed]\" as a result of criminal activity, see Webster's 3d 609; Random House Dictionary of the English Language 389 (1967), and thus to include all gross receipts and not just profit. The House bill defined the term \"criminally derived property\" to mean \"any property constituting, or derived from, <i>proceeds</i> obtained from a criminal offense.\" H.R. 5484, \u00a7 602, at 158 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the House seems to have understood \"proceeds\" to include gross receipts.\n</p>\n<p>The bill passed by the Senate, like the current money laundering statute, simply used the term \"proceeds,\" S. 2683, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 2(a) (1986), and the House acceded to the Senate version. See H.R. 5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 1352, p. 48 (1986) (as enacted).

However, that definition applies only \"[i]n cases involving lawful goods or lawful services that are sold or provided in an illegal manner.\" Calculating net income in that situation is easier than it would be in most money laundering cases, and it is noteworthy that Congress took care to provide rules and procedures to be used in making the calculation. See <i>ibid.</i> If Congress had intended to require proof of net income in money laundering cases, it is likely that Congress likewise would have specified the rules and procedures to be used. It is noteworthy that subparagraph (A) of \u00a7 981(a)(2), which the plurality opinion does not mention, provides that in cases that are more analogous to the typical money laundering case, <i>i.e.,</i> \"cases involving illegal goods [or] illegal services,\" the term \"proceeds\" \"means [any] property of any kind obtained directly or indirectly, as the result of the commission of the offense giving rise to forfeiture, and any property traceable thereto, and is not limited to the net gain or profit realized from the offense.\"</p>\n<p>[9]  <i>United States v.

SANTOS ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 06\u20131005. Argued October 3, 2007\u2014Decided June 2, 2008\nIn an illegal lottery run by respondent Santos, runners took commis-\n  sions from the bets they gathered, and some of the rest of the money\n  was paid as salary to respondent Diaz and other collectors and to the\n  winning gamblers. Based on these payments to runners, collectors,\n  and winners, Santos was convicted of, inter alia, violating the federal\n  money-laundering statute, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71956, which prohibits the use\n  of the \u201cproceeds\u201d of criminal activities for various purposes, including\n  engaging in, and conspiring to engage in, transactions intended to\n  promote the carrying on of unlawful activity, \u00a71956(a)(1)(A)(i) and\n  \u00a71956(h). Based on his receipt of salary, Diaz pleaded guilty to con-\n  spiracy to launder money. The Seventh Circuit affirmed the convic-\n  tions. On collateral review, the District Court ruled that, under in-\n  tervening Circuit precedent interpreting the word \u201cproceeds\u201d in the\n  federal money-laundering statute, \u00a71956(a)(1)(A)(i) applies only to\n  transactions involving criminal profits, not criminal receipts. Find-\n  ing no evidence that the transactions on which respondents\u2019 money-\n  laundering convictions were based involved lottery profits, the court\n  vacated those convictions. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n461 F. 3d 886, affirmed.\n    JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE THOMAS, and\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded in Parts I\u2013III and V that the term \u201cpro-\n  ceeds\u201d in \u00a71956(a)(1) means \u201cprofits,\u201d not \u201creceipts.\u201d Pp. 3\u201314, 16\u201317.\n    (a) The rule of lenity dictates adoption of the \u201cprofits\u201d reading. The\n  statute nowhere defines \u201cproceeds.\u201d An undefined term is generally\n  given its ordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S.\n  179, 187. However, dictionaries and the Federal Criminal Code\n2                     UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    sometimes define \u201cproceeds\u201d to mean \u201creceipts\u201d and sometimes \u201cprof-\n    its.\u201d Moreover, the many provisions in the federal money-laundering\n    statute that use the word \u201cproceeds\u201d make sense under either defini-\n    tion. The rule of lenity therefore requires the statute to be inter-\n    preted in favor of defendants, and the \u201cprofits\u201d definition of \u201cpro-\n    ceeds\u201d is always more defendant-friendly than the \u201creceipts\u201d\n    definition. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) The Government\u2019s contention that the \u201cprofits\u201d interpretation\n    fails to give the money-laundering statute its intended scope begs the\n    question; the Government\u2019s contention that the \u201cprofits\u201d interpreta-\n    tion hinders effective enforcement of the law is exaggerated. Neither\n    suffices to overcome the rule of lenity. Pp. 6\u201314.\n       (c) None of the transactions on which respondents\u2019 money-\n    laundering convictions were based can fairly be characterized as in-\n    volving the lottery\u2019s profits. Pp. 16\u201317.\n       JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE GINSBURG,\n    concluded in Part IV that JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 position that \u201cproceeds\u201d\n    should be interpreted to mean profits for some predicate crimes, \u201cre-\n    ceipts\u201d for others, is contrary to this Court\u2019s precedents holding that\n    judges cannot give the same statutory text different meanings in dif-\n    ferent cases, see Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371. Pp. 14\u201316.\n       JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that revenue a gambling business uses\n    to pay essential operating expenses is not \u201cproceeds\u201d under 18\n    U. S. C. \u00a71956. When, as here, Congress fails to define potentially\n    ambiguous statutory terms, it effectively delegates the task to federal\n    judges. See Commissioner v. Fink, 483 U. S. 89, 104. Because Con-\n    gress could have required that \u201cproceeds\u201d have one meaning when re-\n    ferring to some of the specified unlawful activities listed in\n    \u00a71956(c)(7) and a different meaning when referring to others, judges\n    filling statutory gaps may also do so, as long as they are conscien-\n    tiously endeavoring to carry out Congress\u2019 intent. Section 1956\u2019s leg-\n    islative history makes clear that \u201cproceeds\u201d includes gross revenues\n    from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime\n    syndicates involving such sales, but sheds no light on how to identify\n    the proceeds of an unlicensed stand-alone gambling venture. Fur-\n    thermore, the consequences of applying a \u201cgross receipts\u201d definition of\n    \u201cproceeds\u201d to respondents are so perverse that Congress could not\n    have contemplated them: Allowing the Government to treat the mere\n    payment of an illegal gambling business\u2019 operating expenses as a\n    separate offense is in practical effect tantamount to double jeopardy,\n    which is particularly unfair in this case because the penalties for\n    money laundering are substantially more severe than those for the\n    underlying offense of operating a gambling business. Accordingly,\n    the rule of lenity may weigh in the determination, and in that respect\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

S. C. \u00a71956(a)(1), means\n\u201creceipts\u201d or \u201cprofits.\u201d\n                               I\n   From the 1970\u2019s until 1994, respondent Santos operated a\nlottery in Indiana that was illegal under state law. See Ind.\nCode \u00a735\u201345\u20135\u20133 (West 2004). Santos employed a number\nof helpers to run the lottery. At bars and restaurants,\nSantos\u2019s runners gathered bets from gamblers, kept a por-\ntion of the bets (between 15% and 25%) as their commis-\nsions, and delivered the rest to Santos\u2019s collectors. Collec-\ntors, one of whom was respondent Diaz, then delivered the\nmoney to Santos, who used some of it to pay the salaries of\ncollectors (including Diaz) and to pay the winners.\n   These payments to runners, collectors, and winners\nformed the basis of a 10-count indictment filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\n2               UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                    Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nIndiana, naming Santos, Diaz, and 11 others. A jury\nfound Santos guilty of one count of conspiracy to run an\nillegal gambling business (\u00a7371), one count of running an\nillegal gambling business (\u00a71955), one count of conspiracy\nto launder money (\u00a71956(a)(1)(A)(i) and \u00a71956(h)), and two\ncounts of money laundering (\u00a71956(a)(1)(A)(i)). The court\nsentenced Santos to 60 months of imprisonment on the\ntwo gambling counts and to 210 months of imprisonment\non the three money-laundering counts. Diaz pleaded\nguilty to conspiracy to launder money, and the District\nCourt sentenced him to 108 months of imprisonment. The\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences.\nUnited States v. Febus, 218 F. 3d 784 (CA7 2000). We\ndeclined to review the case. 531 U. S. 1021 (2000).\n   Thereafter, respondents filed motions under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72255, collaterally attacking their convictions and sen-\ntences. The District Court rejected all of their claims but\none, a challenge to their money-laundering convictions\nbased on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s subsequent decision in\nUnited States v. Scialabba, 282 F. 3d 475 (2002), which\nheld that the federal money-laundering statute\u2019s prohibi-\ntion of transactions involving criminal \u201cproceeds\u201d applies\nonly to transactions involving criminal profits, not crimi-\nnal receipts. Id., at 478. Applying that holding to respon-\ndents\u2019 cases, the District Court found no evidence that the\ntransactions on which the money-laundering convictions\nwere based (Santos\u2019s payments to runners, winners, and\ncollectors and Diaz\u2019s receipt of payment for his collection\nservices) involved profits, as opposed to receipts, of the\nillegal lottery, and accordingly vacated the money-\nlaundering convictions. The Court of Appeals affirmed,\nrejecting the Government\u2019s contention that Scialabba was\nwrong and should be overruled. 461 F. 3d 886 (CA7 2006).\nWe granted certiorari. 550 U.

S. C. \u00a71956(a)(1)(A)(i), which\ncriminalizes transactions to promote criminal activity.1\nThis provision uses the term \u201cproceeds\u201d in describing two\nelements of the offense: the Government must prove that a\ncharged transaction \u201cin fact involve[d] the proceeds of\nspecified unlawful activity\u201d (the proceeds element), and it\nalso must prove that a defendant knew \u201cthat the property\ninvolved in\u201d the charged transaction \u201crepresent[ed] the\nproceeds of some form of unlawful activity\u201d (the knowledge\nelement). \u00a71956(a)(1).\n  The federal money-laundering statute does not define\n\u201cproceeds.\u201d When a term is undefined, we give it its ordi-\nnary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S.\n179, 187 (1995). \u201cProceeds\u201d can mean either \u201creceipts\u201d or\n\u201cprofits.\u201d Both meanings are accepted, and have long been\naccepted, in ordinary usage. See, e.g., 12 Oxford English\nDictionary 544 (2d ed. 1989); Random House Dictionary of\nthe English Language 1542 (2d ed. 1987); Webster\u2019s New\nInternational Dictionary 1972 (2d ed. 1957) (hereinafter\nWebster\u2019s 2d). The Government contends that dictionaries\ngenerally prefer the \u201creceipts\u201d definition over the \u201cprofits\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Section 1956(a)(1) reads as follows: \u201cWhoever, knowing that the\n\nproperty involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of\nsome form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a\nfinancial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified\nunlawful activity . . . (A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of\nspecified unlawful activity . . . shall be sentenced to a fine of not more\nthan $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the trans-\naction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty\nyears, or both.\u201d\n   Respondents were also convicted of conspiring to launder money\nunder \u00a71956(h). Because the Government has not argued that respon-\ndents\u2019 conspiracy convictions could stand if \u201cproceeds\u201d meant \u201cprofits,\u201d\nsee 461 F. 3d 866, 889 (CA7 2006), we do not address that possibility.\n4                    UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ndefinition, but any preference is too slight for us to con-\nclude that \u201creceipts\u201d is the primary meaning of \u201cproceeds.\u201d\n   \u201cProceeds,\u201d moreover, has not acquired a common mean-\ning in the provisions of the Federal Criminal Code. Most\nleave the term undefined. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a71963; 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7853. Recognizing the word\u2019s inherent ambiguity,\nCongress has defined \u201cproceeds\u201d in various criminal provi-\nsions, but sometimes has defined it to mean \u201creceipts\u201d and\nsometimes \u201cprofits.\u201d Compare 18 U. S. C. \u00a72339C(e)(3)\n(2000 ed., Supp. V) (receipts), \u00a7981(a)(2)(A) (2000 ed.)\n(same), with \u00a7981(a)(2)(B) (profits).\n   Since context gives meaning, we cannot say the money-\nlaundering statute is truly ambiguous until we consider\n\u201cproceeds\u201d not in isolation but as it is used in the federal\nmoney-laundering statute. See United Sav. Assn. of Tex.\nv. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S.\n365, 371 (1988). The word appears repeatedly throughout\nthe statute, but all of those appearances leave the ambigu-\nity intact. Section 1956(a)(1) itself, for instance, makes\nsense under either definition: one can engage in a finan-\ncial transaction with either receipts or profits of a crime;\none can intend to promote the carrying on of a crime with\neither its receipts or its profits; and one can try to conceal\nthe nature, location, etc., of either receipts or profits. The\nsame is true of all the other provisions of this legislation in\nwhich the term \u201cproceeds\u201d is used. They make sense\nunder either definition. See, for example, \u00a71956(a)(2)(B),\nwhich speaks of \u201cproceeds\u201d represented by a \u201cmonetary\ninstrument or funds.\u201d\n   JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s dissent (the principal dissent) makes\nmuch of the fact that 14 States that use and define the\nword \u201cproceeds\u201d in their money-laundering statutes,2 the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The majority of States with money-laundering laws, in fact, use \u201cpro-\n\nceeds\u201d without defining it.

We do not think this evidence shows that\nthe drafters of the federal money-laundering statute used\n\u201cproceeds\u201d as a term of art for \u201creceipts.\u201d Most of the state\nlaws cited by the dissent, the Model Act, and the treaty\npostdate the 1986 federal money-laundering statute by\nseveral years, so Congress was not acting against the back-\ndrop of those definitions when it enacted the federal stat-\nute. If anything, they show that \u201cproceeds\u201d is ambiguous\nand that others who believed that money-laundering stat-\nutes ought to include gross receipts sought to clarify the\nambiguity that Congress created when it left the term\nundefined.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIdaho Code \u00a718\u20138201 (Lexis 2004); Ill.

App. 2003) (linking \u201cproceeds\u201d with the defined term\n\u201cproperty\u201d). California might belong in this list, for it has a money-\nlaundering provision in its Penal Code, in which it uses the term\n\u201cproceeds\u201d but does not define it. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7186.10\n(West 1999). But California also has a more limited money-laundering\nstatute that uses and defines \u201cproceeds.\u201d See Cal. Health & Safety\nCode Ann. \u00a711370.9(h)(1) (West 2007). Maryland might belong on the\nlist as well: Its general money-laundering statute defines \u201cproceeds\u201d\nsimply to set a minimum value on the proceeds laundered, Md. Crim.\nLaw Code Ann. \u00a75\u2013623(a)(5) (Lexis 2002) (\u201cmoney or any other property\nwith a value exceeding $10,000\u201d), and its more limited money-\nlaundering statute does not define the term, see \u00a711\u2013304.\n   3 The principal dissent also suggests that Congress thought \u201cproceeds\u201d\n\nmeant \u201creceipts\u201d because the House of Representatives (but not the\nSenate) had passed a money-laundering bill that did not use the word\n6                    UNITED STATES v.

From the face of the statute,\nthere is no more reason to think that \u201cproceeds\u201d means\n\u201creceipts\u201d than there is to think that \u201cproceeds\u201d means\n\u201cprofits.\u201d Under a long line of our decisions, the tie must\ngo to the defendant. The rule of lenity requires ambiguous\ncriminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants\nsubjected to them. See United States v. Gradwell, 243\nU. S. 476, 485 (1917); McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S.\n25, 27 (1931); United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347\u2013\n349 (1971). This venerable rule not only vindicates the\nfundamental principle that no citizen should be held\naccountable for a violation of a statute whose commands\nare uncertain, or subjected to punishment that is not\nclearly prescribed. It also places the weight of inertia\nupon the party that can best induce Congress to speak\nmore clearly and keeps courts from making criminal law\nin Congress\u2019s stead. Because the \u201cprofits\u201d definition of\n\u201cproceeds\u201d is always more defendant-friendly than the\n\u201creceipts\u201d definition, the rule of lenity dictates that it\nshould be adopted.\n                           III\n  Stopping short of calling the \u201cprofits\u201d interpretation\nabsurd, the Government contends that the interpretation\nshould nonetheless be rejected because it fails to give the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cproceeds\u201d but rather used and defined a term (\u201ccriminally derived\nproperty\u201d) that, perhaps, included receipts. See post, at 5, n. 5. Putting\naside the question whether resort to legislative history is ever appropri-\nate when interpreting a criminal statute, compare United States v.\nR. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 306, n. 6 (1992), with id., at 307 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment), that bit of it is totally\nunenlightening because we do not know why the earlier House terminol-\nogy was rejected\u2014because \u201cproceeds\u201d captured the same meaning, or\nbecause \u201cproceeds\u201d carried a narrower meaning?\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

Nei-\nther contention overcomes the rule of lenity.\n                               A\n   According to the Government, if we do not read \u201cpro-\nceeds\u201d to mean \u201creceipts,\u201d we will disserve the purpose of\nthe federal money-laundering statute, which is, the Gov-\nernment says, to penalize criminals who conceal or pro-\nmote their illegal activities. On the Government\u2019s view,\n\u201c[t]he gross receipts of a crime accurately reflect the scale\nof the criminal activity, because the illegal activity gener-\nated all of the funds.\u201d Brief for United States 21; see also\npost, at 5\u20137 (ALITO, J., dissenting).\n   When interpreting a criminal statute, we do not play the\npart of a mind reader. In our seminal rule-of-lenity\ndecision, Chief Justice Marshall rejected the impulse to\nspeculate regarding a dubious congressional intent.\n\u201c[P]robability is not a guide which a court, in construing a\npenal statute, can safely take.\u201d United States v. Wiltber-\nger, 5 Wheat. 76, 105 (1820). And Justice Frankfurter,\nwriting for the Court in another case, said the following:\n\u201cWhen Congress leaves to the Judiciary the task of imput-\ning to Congress an undeclared will, the ambiguity should\nbe resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d Bell v. United States, 349\nU. S. 81, 83 (1955).\n   The statutory purpose advanced by the Government to\nconstrue \u201cproceeds\u201d is a textbook example of begging the\nquestion. To be sure, if \u201cproceeds\u201d meant \u201creceipts,\u201d one\ncould say that the statute was aimed at the dangers of\nconcealment and promotion. But whether \u201cproceeds\u201d\nmeans \u201creceipts\u201d is the very issue in the case. If \u201cpro-\nceeds\u201d means \u201cprofits,\u201d one could say that the statute is\naimed at the distinctive danger that arises from leaving in\ncriminal hands the yield of a crime. A rational Congress\ncould surely have decided that the risk of leveraging one\n8                UNITED STATES v.

S. C. \u00a71955,\nwould \u201cmerge\u201d with the money-laundering statute. Con-\ngress evidently decided that lottery operators ordinarily\ndeserve up to 5 years of imprisonment, \u00a71955(a), but as a\nresult of merger they would face an additional 20 years,\n\u00a71956(a)(1). Prosecutors, of course, would acquire the\ndiscretion to charge the lesser lottery offense, the greater\nmoney-laundering offense, or both\u2014which would pre-\ndictably be used to induce a plea bargain to the lesser\ncharge.\n   The merger problem is not limited to lottery operators.\nFor a host of predicate crimes, merger would depend on\nthe manner and timing of payment for the expenses asso-\nciated with the commission of the crime. Few crimes are\nentirely free of cost, and costs are not always paid in\nadvance. Anyone who pays for the costs of a crime with its\nproceeds\u2014for example, the felon who uses the stolen\nmoney to pay for the rented getaway car\u2014would violate\nthe money-laundering statute. And any wealth-acquiring\ncrime with multiple participants would become money-\nlaundering when the initial recipient of the wealth gives\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

There are more than\n250 predicate offenses for the money-laundering statute,\nsee Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, M. Moti-\nvans, Money Laundering Offenders 1994\u20132001, p. 2 (2003),\nonline at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/mlo01.pdf (as\nvisited May 29, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file), and many foreseeably entail such transactions,\nsee 18 U. S. C. \u00a71956(c)(7) (establishing as predicate of-\nfenses a number of illegal trafficking and selling offenses,\nthe expenses of which might be paid after the illegal\ntransportation or sale).\n   The Government suggests no explanation for why Con-\ngress would have wanted a transaction that is a normal\npart of a crime it had duly considered and appropriately\npunished elsewhere in the Criminal Code to radically\nincrease the sentence for that crime. Interpreting \u201cpro-\nceeds\u201d to mean \u201cprofits\u201d eliminates the merger problem.\nTransactions that normally occur during the course of\nrunning a lottery are not identifiable uses of profits and\nthus do not violate the money-laundering statute. More\ngenerally, a criminal who enters into a transaction paying\nthe expenses of his illegal activity cannot possibly violate\nthe money-laundering statute, because by definition prof-\nits consist of what remains after expenses are paid. De-\nfraying an activity\u2019s costs with its receipts simply will not\nbe covered.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The Solicitor General suggests that this is the case even under the\n\n\u201cprofits\u201d interpretation. See Reply Brief for United States 16; see also\npost, at 15\u201316 (ALITO, J., dissenting). That is not so, because when the\n\u201cloot\u201d comes into the hands of the later distributing felon his confeder-\nates\u2019 shares are (as to him) not profits but mere receipts subject to his\npayment of expenses.\n10                   UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   The principal dissent suggests that a solution to the\nmerger problem may be found in giving a narrow interpre-\ntation to the \u201cpromotion prong\u201d of the statute: A defendant\nmight be deemed not to \u201cpromote\u201d illegal activity \u201cby doing\nthose things . . . that are needed merely to keep the busi-\nness running,\u201d post, at 18, because promotion (presuma-\nbly) means doing things that will cause a business to grow.\nSee Webster\u2019s 2d, p. 1981 (giving as one of the meanings of\n\u201cpromote\u201d \u201c[t]o contribute to the growth [or] enlargement\u201d\nof something). (This argument is embraced by JUSTICE\nBREYER\u2019s dissent as well. See post, at 2.) The federal\nmoney-laundering statute, however, bars not the bare act\nof promotion, but engaging in certain transactions \u201cwith\nthe intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful\nactivity.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71956(a)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added).\nIn that context the word naturally bears one of its other\nmeanings, such as \u201c[t]o contribute to the . . . prosperity\u201d of\nsomething, or to \u201cfurther\u201d something. See Webster\u2019s 2d,\np. 1981. Surely one promotes \u201cthe carrying on\u201d of a gam-\nbling enterprise by merely assuring that it continues in\nbusiness.5 In any event, to believe that this \u201cnarrow\u201d\ninterpretation of \u201cpromote\u201d would solve the merger prob-\nlem one must share the dissent\u2019s misperception that the\nstatute applies just to the conduct of ongoing enterprises\nrather than individual unlawful acts. If the predicate act\nis theft by an individual, it makes no sense to ask whether\nan expenditure was intended to \u201cgrow\u201d the culprit\u2019s theft\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 We note in passing the peculiarity that a dissent which rejects our\n\ninterpretation of \u201cproceeds\u201d because knowledge of profits will be diffi-\ncult to prove, suggests an interpretation of \u201cpromotes\u201d that will require\nproving that a particular expenditure was intended, not merely to keep\na business \u201crunning,\u201d but to expand it. (\u201cYou must decide, ladies and\ngentlemen of the jury, whether it is true beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the payoff of this winning bettor was not simply motivated by a\ndesire to bring him and other current gambling customers back, but\nwas meant to create a reputation for reliable payoff that would attract\nfuture customers.\u201d)\n                  Cite as: 553 U.

The merger problem thus stands as a major\nobstacle to the dissent\u2019s interpretation of \u201cproceeds.\u201d\n   JUSTICE BREYER admits that the merger problem casts\ndoubt on the Government\u2019s position, post, at 1, but be-\nlieves there are \u201cother, more legally felicitous\u201d solutions to\nthe problem, post, at 2. He suggests that the merger\nproblem could be solved by holding that \u201cthe money laun-\ndering offense and the underlying offense that generated\nthe money to be laundered must be distinct in order to be\nseparately punishable.\u201d Ibid. The insuperable difficulty\nwith this solution is that it has no basis whatever in the\nwords of the statute. Even assuming (as one should not)\nthe propriety of a judicial rewrite, why should one believe\nthat Congress wanted courts to avoid the merger problem\nin that unusual fashion, rather than by adopting one of\nthe two possible meanings of an ambiguous term?\nJUSTICE BREYER pins hope on the possibility, \u201cif the\n\u2018merger\u2019 problem is essentially a problem of fairness in\nsentencing,\u201d that the United States Sentencing Commis-\nsion might revise its recommended sentences for money\nlaundering. Post, at 2\u20133. See also principal dissent, post,\nat 17\u201318 (in agreement). Even if that is a possibility, it is\nnot a certainty. And once again, why should one choose\nthis chancy method of solving the problem, rather than\ninterpret ambiguous language to avoid it? In any event,\nas noted, supra, at 8, the merger problem affects more\nthan just sentencing; it affects charging decisions and\nplea-bargaining as well.\n                              B\n  The Government also argues for the \u201creceipts\u201d interpre-\ntation because\u2014quite frankly\u2014it is easier to prosecute.\nProving the proceeds and knowledge elements of the fed-\neral money-laundering offense under the \u201cprofits\u201d inter-\npretation will unquestionably require proof that is more\ndifficult to obtain. Essentially, the Government asks us to\n12                   UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nresolve the statutory ambiguity in light of Congress\u2019s\npresumptive intent to facilitate money-laundering prose-\ncutions. That position turns the rule of lenity upside-\ndown. We interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor\nof defendants, not prosecutors.\n   It is true that the \u201cprofits\u201d interpretation demands more\nfrom the Government than the \u201creceipts\u201d interpretation.\nNot so much more, however, as to render such a disposi-\ntion inconceivable\u2014as proved by the fact that Congress\nhas imposed similar proof burdens upon the prosecution\nelsewhere. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a71963(a) (criminal forfeiture\nprovision requiring determination of \u201cgross profits or other\nproceeds\u201d); 21 U. S. C. \u00a7853(a) (same).6 It is untrue that\nthe added burdens \u201cserve no discernible purpose.\u201d Post, at\n12 (ALITO, J., dissenting). They ensure that the severe\nmoney-laundering penalties will be imposed only for the\nremoval of profits from criminal activity, which permit the\nleveraging of one criminal activity into the next. See\nsupra, at 7\u20138.\n   In any event, the Government exaggerates the difficul-\nties. The \u201cproceeds of specified unlawful activity\u201d are the\nproceeds from the conduct sufficient to prove one predicate\noffense. Thus, to establish the proceeds element under the\n\u201cprofits\u201d interpretation, the prosecution needs to show\nonly that a single instance of specified unlawful activity\nwas profitable and gave rise to the money involved in a\ncharged transaction. And the Government, of course, can\nselect the instances for which the profitability is clearest.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The  principal dissent claims that these statutes do not require proof\nof profits because the Government could rely upon the \u201cother proceeds\u201d\nprong, which the dissent interprets to mean all proceeds, gross profits\nand everything else. See post, at 16. We do not normally interpret a\ntext in a manner that makes one of its provisions superfluous. But\neven if we did, these provisions would still establish what the dissent\nbelieves unthinkable: that Congress could envision the Government\u2019s\nproving profits.\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

What counts is whether the\nreceipts from the charged unlawful act exceeded the costs\nfairly attributable to it.7\n  When the Government charges an \u201centerprise\u201d crime as\nthe predicate offense, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a71956(c)(7)(C), it\nwill have to prove the profitability of only the conduct\nsufficient to violate the enterprise statute. That is typi-\ncally defined as a \u201ccontinuing series of violations,\u201d 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7848(c)(2), which would presumably be satisfied\nby three violations, see Richardson v. United States, 526\nU. S. 813, 818 (1999). Thus, the Government will have to\nprove the profitability of just three offenses, selecting\n(again) those for which profitability is clearest. And of\ncourse a prosecutor will often be able to charge the under-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The   principal dissent asks, \u201c[H]ow long does each gambling \u2018in-\nstance\u2019 last?\u201d Post, at 14. The answer is \u201cas long as the Government\nchooses to charge.\u201d Title 18 U. S. C. \u00a71955(a) provides that \u201c[w]hoever\nconducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of\nan illegal gambling business shall be fined under this title or impris-\noned not more than five years, or both.\u201d An illegal gambling business is\nan illegal gambling business during each moment of its operation, and\nit will be up to the Government to select that period of time for which it\ncan most readily establish the necessary elements of the charged\noffenses, including (if money laundering is one of them) profitability.\n(To the extent this raises the possibility of the Government\u2019s making\nmultiple violations out of one person\u2019s running of a single business, that\nproblem arises no matter what definition of \u201cproceeds\u201d is adopted.) The\n\u201cpreposterous results\u201d that the dissent attributes to our interpretation\nof \u201cproceeds,\u201d post, at 14, are in fact the consequence of the Govern-\nment\u2019s decision to charge Santos with conducting a gambling business\nover a 6-year period. Of course in the vast majority of cases, establish-\ning the profitability of the predicate offense will not put the Govern-\nment to the task of identifying the relevant period. Most criminal\nstatutes prohibit discrete, individual acts (fraud, bank robbery) rather\nthan the conduct of a business.\n14                   UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nlying crimes instead of the overarching enterprise crime.\n  As for the knowledge element of the money-laundering\noffense\u2014knowledge that the transaction involves profits of\nunlawful activity\u2014that will be provable (as knowledge\nmust almost always be proved) by circumstantial evidence.\nFor example, someone accepting receipts from what he\nknows to be a long-continuing drug-dealing operation can\nbe found to know that they include some profits. And a\njury could infer from a long-running launderer-criminal\nrelationship that the launderer knew he was hiding the\ncriminal\u2019s profits. Moreover, the Government will be\nentitled to a willful blindness instruction if the profes-\nsional money launderer, aware of a high probability that\nthe laundered funds were profits, deliberately avoids\nlearning the truth about them\u2014as might be the case when\nhe knows that the underlying crime is one that is rarely\nunprofitable.\n                             IV\n  Concurring in the judgment, JUSTICE STEVENS ex-\npresses the view that the rule of lenity applies to this case\nbecause there is no legislative history reflecting any legis-\nlator\u2019s belief about how the money-laundering statute\nshould apply to lottery operators. See post, at 3, 5. The\nrule of lenity might not apply, he thinks, in a case involv-\ning an organized crime syndicate or the sale of contraband\nbecause the legislative history supposedly contains some\nviews on the meaning of \u201cproceeds\u201d in those circum-\nstances.8 See post, at 2\u20133, and n. 3. In short, JUSTICE\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 JUSTICE STEVENS fails to identify the legislative history to which he\nrefers. He offers only: \u201cAs JUSTICE ALITO rightly argues, the legislative\nhistory of \u00a71956 makes it clear that Congress intended the term \u2018pro-\nceeds\u2019 to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the\noperation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales.\u201d Post, at\n2\u20133. Although JUSTICE ALITO, from one item of legislative history,\ndraws an inference about the meaning of \u201cproceeds\u201d in all its applica-\ntions (which we find dubious, see n. 3, supra), nowhere does he cite\n                    Cite as: 553 U.

JUSTICE STEVENS relies on the\nproposition that one undefined word, repeated in different\nstatutory provisions, can have different meanings in each\nprovision. See post, at 2, and n. 2. But that is worlds\napart from giving the same word, in the same statutory\nprovision, different meanings in different factual contexts.\nNot only have we never engaged in such interpretive\ncontortion; just over three years ago, in an opinion joined\nby JUSTICE STEVENS, we forcefully rejected it. Clark v.\nMartinez, 543 U. S. 371 (2005), held that the meaning of\nwords in a statute cannot change with the statute\u2019s appli-\ncation. See id., at 378. To hold otherwise \u201cwould render\nevery statute a chameleon,\u201d id., at 382, and \u201cwould estab-\nlish within our jurisprudence . . . the dangerous principle\nthat judges can give the same statutory text different\nmeanings in different cases,\u201d id., at 386. Precisely to avoid\nthat result, our cases often \u201cgive a statute\u2019s ambiguous\nlanguage a limiting construction called for by one of the\nstatute\u2019s applications, even though other of the statute\u2019s\napplications, standing alone, would not support the same\nlimitation. The lowest common denominator, as it were,\nmust govern.\u201d Id., at 380 (emphasis added).\n   Our obligation to maintain the consistent meaning of\nwords in statutory text does not disappear when the rule\nof lenity is involved. To the contrary, we have resolved an\nambiguity in a tax statute in favor of the taxpayer in a\ncivil case because the statute had criminal applications\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlegislative history addressing the meaning of the word \u201cproceeds\u201d in\ncases specifically involving contraband or organized crime. Thus\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 concurrence appears to address not only a hypotheti-\ncal case, see infra, at 16, but even an imagined legislative history.\n16               UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthat triggered the rule of lenity. See United States v.\nThompson/Center Arms Co., 504 U. S. 505, 517\u2013518, and\nn. 10 (1992) (plurality opinion). If anything, the rule of\nlenity is an additional reason to remain consistent, lest\nthose subject to the criminal law be misled. And even if,\nas JUSTICE STEVENS contends, post, at 1, statutory ambi-\nguity \u201ceffectively\u201d licenses us to write a brand-new law, we\ncannot accept that power in a criminal case, where the law\nmust be written by Congress. See United States v. Hud-\nson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812).\n   We think it appropriate to add a word concerning the\nstare decisis effect of JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion. Since his\nvote is necessary to our judgment, and since his opinion\nrests upon the narrower ground, the Court\u2019s holding is\nlimited accordingly. See Marks v. United States, 430 U. S.\n188, 193 (1977). But the narrowness of his ground con-\nsists of finding that \u201cproceeds\u201d means \u201cprofits\u201d when there\nis no legislative history to the contrary. That is all that\nour judgment holds. It does not hold that the outcome is\ndifferent when contrary legislative history does exist.\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 speculations on that point address a\ncase that is not before him, are the purest of dicta, and\nform no part of today\u2019s holding. Thus, as far as this par-\nticular statute is concerned, counsel remain free to argue\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 view (and to explain why it does not\noverrule Clark v. Martinez, supra). They should be\nwarned, however: Not only do the Justices joining this\nopinion reject that view, but so also (apparently) do the\nJustices joining the principal dissent.

See Commissioner v.\nFink, 483 U. S. 89, 104 (1987) (STEVENS, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cIn the process of legislating it is inevitable that Congress\nwill leave open spaces in the law that the courts are im-\nplicitly authorized to fill\u201d). Congress has included defini-\ntions of the term \u201cproceeds\u201d in some criminal statutes,1 but\nit has not done so in 18 U. S. C. \u00a71956 (2000 ed. and Supp.\nV), the money laundering statute at issue in this case.\nThat statute is somewhat unique because it applies to the\nproceeds of a varied and lengthy list of specified unlawful\nactivities, see \u00a71956(c)(7) (defining \u201cspecified unlawful\nactivity\u201d to include, inter alia, controlled substance viola-\ntions, murder, bribery, smuggling, various forms of fraud,\nconcealment of assets, various environmental offenses,\nand health care offenses).\n   Although it did not do so, it seems clear that Congress\ncould have provided that the term \u201cproceeds\u201d shall have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 For example, 18 U. S. C. \u00a72339C(e)(3) (2000 ed., Supp. V), which\n\nprohibits the concealment of proceeds derived from funds used to\nsupport terrorism, defines \u201cproceeds\u201d to mean \u201cany funds derived from\nor obtained, directly or indirectly, through the commission of [the]\noffense.\u201d\n2                   UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\none meaning when referring to some specified unlawful\nactivities and a different meaning when referring to oth-\ners. In fact, in the general civil forfeiture statute, \u00a7981,\nCongress did provide two different definitions of \u201cpro-\nceeds,\u201d recognizing that\u2014for a subset of activities\u2014\n\u201cproceeds\u201d must allow for the deduction of costs. Compare\n\u00a7981(a)(2)(A) (2000 ed.) (defining \u201cproceeds\u201d in cases in-\nvolving illegal goods and services to mean \u201cproperty of any\nkind obtained directly or indirectly . . . not limited to the\nnet gain or profit realized from the offense\u201d) with\n\u00a7981(a)(2)(B) (defining \u201cproceeds\u201d with respect to lawful\ngoods sold in an illegal manner as the amount of money\nacquired \u201cless the direct costs incurred in providing the\ngoods or services\u201d).\n   We have previously recognized that the same word can\nhave different meanings in the same statute.2 If Congress\ncould have expressly defined the term \u201cproceeds\u201d differ-\nently when applied to different specified unlawful activi-\nties, it seems to me that judges filling the gap in a statute\nwith such a variety of applications may also do so, as long\nas they are conscientiously endeavoring to carry out the\nintent of Congress. Therefore, contrary to what JUSTICE\nALITO and the plurality state, see post, at 17 (dissenting\nopinion); ante, at 15-16 (plurality opinion), this Court need\nnot pick a single definition of \u201cproceeds\u201d applicable to\nevery unlawful activity, no matter how incongruous some\napplications may be.\n   As JUSTICE ALITO rightly argues, the legislative history\nof \u00a71956 makes it clear that Congress intended the term\n\u201cproceeds\u201d to include gross revenues from the sale of con-\ntraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 See,\n         e.g., General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S.\n581, 595 (2004) (rejecting the presumption that the term \u201cage\u201d had an\nidentical meaning throughout the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct of 1967).\n                      Cite as: 553 U.

For example, one specified unlaw-\nful activity is the conduct proscribed by \u00a7541, \u201cEntry of\ngoods falsely classified.\u201d      Section 541 provides that\n\u201c[w]hoever knowingly effects any entry of goods, wares, or\nmerchandise, at less than the true weight or measure\nthereof, or upon a false classification as to quality or\nvalue, or by the payment of less than the amount of duty\nlegally due, shall be . . . imprisoned not more than two\nyears.\u201d Conceivably the \u201cproceeds\u201d stemming from a\nviolation of \u00a7541 could be either the money realized by\nmisstating the value\u2014that is, the amount by which the\ncriminal \u201cprofits\u201d by paying reduced duties\u2014or the total\nprice at which the goods are later sold, even though the\nmisclassification had only a trivial impact on that price.\n   Just as the legislative history fails to tell us how to\ncalculate the \u201cproceeds\u201d of violations of \u00a7541, it is equally\nsilent on the proceeds of an unlicensed stand-alone gam-\nbling venture. The consequences of applying a \u201cgross\nreceipts\u201d definition of \u201cproceeds\u201d to the gambling operation\nconducted by respondents are so perverse that I cannot\nbelieve they were contemplated by Congress, particularly\ngiven the fact that nothing in JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s thorough\nreview of the legislative history indicates otherwise.4\n   Constrained by a holding that the payment of expenses\nconstitutes \u201cpromotion,\u201d5 JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s opinion runs\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Thus, I cannot agree with the plurality that the rule of lenity must\n\napply to the definition of \u201cproceeds\u201d for these types of unlawful activities.\n  4 As JUSTICE ALITO notes, some reference was made in the legislative\n\nhistory to gambling as a part of a broader criminal syndicate\u2019s activities.\nPost, at 10. But that reference does not indicate that Congress intended\nthe \u201cproceeds\u201d of a gambling business to include gross receipts.\n  5 The Seventh Circuit held on a prior appeal that respondent Santos\u2019\n\nactions were legally sufficient to convict him of promoting the carrying\non of a business under \u00a71956, United States v. Febus, 218 F. 3d 784,\n789\u2013790 (2000). JUSTICE ALITO criticizes the plurality for allowing the\n4                   UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsquarely into what can be characterized as the \u201cmerger\u201d\nproblem. Allowing the Government to treat the mere\npayment of the expense of operating an illegal gambling\nbusiness as a separate offense is in practical effect tanta-\nmount to double jeopardy, which is particularly unfair in\nthis case because the penalties for money laundering are\nsubstantially more severe than those for the underlying\noffense of operating a gambling business. A money laun-\ndering conviction increases the statutory maximum from 5\nto 20 years, and the Sentencing Commission has pre-\nscribed different Guidelines ranges for the two crimes.6\nWhen a defendant has a significant criminal history or\nGuidelines enhancements apply, the statutory cap of five\nyears in \u00a71955 is an important limitation on a defendant\u2019s\nsentence\u2014a limitation that would be eviscerated if\nJUSTICE ALITO\u2019s definition of \u201cproceeds\u201d were applied in\nthis case.\n  JUSTICE ALITO and JUSTICE BREYER suggest that the\nadvisory nature of the Guidelines post-Booker, United\nStates v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), or the possibility of\nan amendment to the money laundering Guideline, would\nsoften this blow, post, at 17-18 (opinion of ALITO, J.); post,\nat 2\u20133 (opinion of BREYER, J.), and indeed they could.

I do not base my\nopinion on any disagreement with the interpretation of \u201cpromotion.\u201d\n  6 For example, under the 2007 Guidelines, the base offense level for\n\nrunning a gambling business is 12. United States Sentencing Commis-\nsion, Guidelines Manual \u00a72E3.1 (Nov. 2007) (USSG). Section 2S1.1,\nwhich provides the base offense level for money laundering, adds 2\nlevels to the base offense level for the underlying crime where the\ndefendant is convicted under 18 U. S. C. \u00a71956. This scheme for\ndetermining the base offense level first appeared in the November 2001\nSentencing Guidelines. Prior to 2001, the difference between sentences\nfor gambling and money laundering was even more pronounced, as\nUSSG \u00a72S1.1 (Nov. 2000) set an offense level of 23, which could be\nincreased if the value of the funds exceeded $100,000.\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

If JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s opinion were to carry the day,\nboth respondents would return to prison to serve the\nremainder of their lengthy sentences.\n  The revenue generated by a gambling business that is\nused to pay the essential expenses of operating that busi-\nness is not \u201cproceeds\u201d within the meaning of the money\nlaundering statute. As the plurality notes, there is \u201cno\nexplanation for why Congress would have wanted a trans-\naction that is a normal part of a crime it had duly consid-\nered and appropriately punished elsewhere in the Crimi-\nnal Code, to radically increase the sentence for that\ncrime.\u201d Ante, at 9. This conclusion dovetails with what\ncommon sense and the rule of lenity would require. Faced\nwith both a lack of legislative history speaking to the\ndefinition of \u201cproceeds\u201d when operating a gambling busi-\nness is the \u201cspecified unlawful activity\u201d and my conviction\nthat Congress could not have intended the perverse result\nthat would obtain in this case under JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s\nopinion, the rule of lenity may weigh in the determination.\nAnd in that respect the plurality\u2019s opinion is surely per-\nsuasive.7 Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 In what can only be characterized as the \u201cpurest of dicta,\u201d the plu-\n\nrality speculates about the stare decisis effect of our judgment and\ninterprets my conclusion as resting on the ground that \u201c \u2018proceeds\u2019\nmeans \u2018profits\u2019 when there is no legislative history to the contrary.\u201d\nAnte, at 16. That is not correct; my conclusion rests on my conviction\nthat Congress could not have intended the perverse result that the\ndissent\u2019s rule would produce if its definition of \u201cproceeds\u201d were applied\nto the operation of an unlicensed gambling business. In other applica-\ntions of the statute not involving such a perverse result, I would pre-\nsume that the legislative history summarized by JUSTICE ALITO reflects\nthe intent of the enacting Congress. See post, at 2 and n. 1 (opinion of\nALITO, J.). Its decision to leave the term undefined is consistent with\nmy view that \u201cproceeds\u201d need not be given the same definition when\n6                  UNITED STATES v.

Like\nthe plurality, I doubt that Congress intended the money\nlaundering statute automatically to cover financial trans-\nactions that constitute an essential part of a different\nunderlying crime. Operating an illegal gambling business,\nfor example, inevitably involves investment in overhead as\nwell as payments to employees and winning customers; a\ndrug offense normally involves payment for drugs; and\nbank robbery may well require the distribution of stolen\ncash to confederates. If the money laundering statute\napplies to this kind of transaction (i.e., if the transaction is\nautomatically a \u201cfinancial transaction\u201d that \u201cinvolves the\nproceeds of specified unlawful activity\u201d made \u201cwith the\nintent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful\nactivity\u201d), then the Government can seek a heavier money\nlaundering penalty (say, 20 years), even though the only\nconduct at issue is conduct that warranted a lighter pen-\nalty (say, 5 years for illegal gambling). 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71956(a)(1).\n   It is difficult to understand why Congress would have\nintended the Government to possess this punishment-\ntransforming power. Perhaps for this reason, the Tenth\n2                UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCircuit has written that \u201cCongress aimed the crime of\nmoney laundering at conduct that follows in time the\nunderlying crime rather than to afford an alternative\nmeans of punishing the prior \u2018specified unlawful activity.\u2019 \u201d\nUnited States v. Edgmon, 952 F. 2d 1206, 1214 (1991).\nAnd, in 1997, the United States Sentencing Commission\ntold Congress that it agreed with the Department of Jus-\ntice that \u201cmoney laundering cannot properly be charged\nfor \u2018merged\u2019 transactions that are part of the underly-\ning crime.\u201d Report to Congress: Sentencing Policy for\nMoney Laundering Offenses, including Comments on a\nDept. of Justice Report, p. 16 (Sept. 1997), online at http://\nwww.ussc.gov/r_congress/launder.pdf (as visited May 20,\n2008, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n   Thus, like the plurality, I see a \u201cmerger\u201d problem. But,\nunlike the plurality, I do not believe that we should look to\nthe word \u201cproceeds\u201d for a solution. For one thing, the\nplurality\u2019s interpretation of that word creates the serious\nlogical and practical difficulties that JUSTICE ALITO de-\nscribes. See post, at 7\u201312 (dissenting opinion) (describing\ndifficulties associated with proof and accounting). For\nanother thing, there are other, more legally felicitous\nplaces to look for a solution. The Tenth Circuit, for exam-\nple, has simply held that the money laundering offense\nand the underlying offense that generated the money to be\nlaundered must be distinct in order to be separately pun-\nishable. Edgmon, supra, at 1214. Alternatively the\nmoney laundering statute\u2019s phrase \u201cwith the intent to\npromote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\u201d\nmay not apply where, for example, only one instance of\nthat underlying activity is at issue. (The Seventh Circuit\non a prior appeal in this case rejected that argument, and\nthus we do not consider it here. See United States v.\nFebus, 218 F. 3d 784, 789 (2000).)\n   Finally, if the \u201cmerger\u201d problem is essentially a problem\nof fairness in sentencing, the Sentencing Commission has\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nadequate authority to address it. Congress has instructed\nthe Commission to \u201cavoi[d] unwarranted sentencing dis-\nparities\u201d among those \u201cfound guilty of similar criminal\nconduct.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7991(b)(1)(B) (emphasis added); see\nalso \u00a7994(f) (instructing the Commission to pay particular\nattention to those disparities). The current money laun-\ndering Guideline, United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual \u00a72S1.1 (Nov. 2007) (USSG), by making\nno exception for a situation where nothing but a single\ninstance of the underlying crime has taken place, would\nseem to create a serious and unwarranted disparity among\ndefendants who have engaged in identical conduct. My\nhope is that the Commission\u2019s past efforts to tie more\nclosely the offense level for money laundering to the of-\nfense level of the underlying crime, see id., Supp. to App.\nC, Amdt. 634 (Nov. 2001), suggest a willingness to con-\nsider directly this kind of disparity. Such an approach\ncould solve the \u201cmerger\u201d problem without resort to creat-\ning complex interpretations of the statute\u2019s language. And\nany such solution could be applied retroactively. See 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7994(u).\n  In light of these alternative possibilities, I dissent.\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

It strongly suggests\nthat when lawmakers, knowledgeable about the nature\nand problem of money laundering, use the term \u201cproceeds\u201d\nin a money laundering provision, they customarily mean\nfor the term to reach all receipts and not just profits.5\n                             B\n  There is a very good reason for this uniform pattern of\nusage. Money laundering provisions serve two chief ends.\nFirst, they provide deterrence by preventing drug traffick-\ners and other criminals who amass large quantities of cash\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  The only state money laundering statute the even uses the term\n\u201cprofits,\u201d \u201cnet income,\u201d or something similar is that of Arkansas, which\nplainly defines \u201ccriminal proceeds\u201d to include all gross receipts of\ncriminal conduct: \u201c \u2018Criminal proceeds\u2019 means: (A) Anything of value\nfurnished or intended to be furnished in exchange for criminal conduct\nor contraband received in violation of state or federal law; and (B)\nProperty or profits traceable to\u201d such an exchange. Ark. Code Ann. \u00a75\u2013\n42\u2013203(5) (2006).\n  5 The version of the money laundering statute originally passed by\n\nthe House reflected a similar legislative judgment. The bill made it a\ncrime to engage in financial transactions and certain commercial\ntransactions involving \u201ccriminally derived property that is derived from\na designated offense.\u201d H. R. 5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7602, p. 154\n(1986) (as introduced). The term \u201ccriminally derived property\u201d is\nnaturally understood to include all property that is \u201creceive[d]\u201d or\n\u201cobtain[ed]\u201d as a result of criminal activity, see Webster\u2019s 3d 609;\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language 389 (1967), and\nthus to include all gross receipts and not just profit. The House bill\ndefined the term \u201ccriminally derived property\u201d to mean \u201cany property\nconstituting, or derived from, proceeds obtained from a criminal of-\nfense.\u201d H. R. 5484, \u00a7602, at 158 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the\nHouse seems to have understood \u201cproceeds\u201d to include gross receipts.\n  The bill passed by the Senate, like the current money laundering\nstatute, simply used the term \u201cproceeds,\u201d S. 2683, 99th Cong., 2d Sess.,\n\u00a72(a) (1986), and the House acceded to the Senate version. See H. R.\n5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a71352, p. 48 (1986) (as enacted). There is no\nsuggestion in the legislative history that the term \u201ccriminally derived\nproperty\u201d and the term \u201cproceeds\u201d were perceived as having different\nmeanings.\n6                UNITED STATES v.

Second, they inhibit the growth of\ncriminal enterprises by preventing the use of dirty money\nto promote the enterprise\u2019s growth. See, e.g., 18 U. S.

Penal\nCode \u00a7\u00a734.02(a)(3)\u2013(4).\n   Both of these objectives are frustrated if a money laun-\ndering statute is limited to profits. Dirty money may be\nused to support \u201ca luxurious lifestyle\u201d and to grow an\nillegal enterprise whenever the enterprise possesses large\namounts of illegally obtained cash. And illegal enterprises\nmay acquire such cash while engaging in unlawful activity\nthat is unprofitable.\n   Suppose, for example, that a drug cartel sends a large\nshipment of drugs to this country, a good part of the ship-\nment is intercepted, the remainder is sold, the cartel ends\nup with a net loss but with a large quantity of cash on its\nhands, and the cartel uses the cash in financial transac-\ntions that are designed to conceal the source of the cash or\nto promote further crime. There is no plausible reason\nwhy Congress would not have wanted the money launder-\ning statute to apply to these financial transactions. If the\ncartel leaders use the money to live in luxury, this pro-\nvides an incentive for these individuals to stay in the\nbusiness and for others to enter. If the cartel uses the\nmoney to finance future drug shipments or to expand the\nbusiness, public safety is harmed.\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   It is certainly true that Congress, in enacting the federal\nmoney laundering statute, was primarily concerned about\ncriminal enterprises that realize profits. A criminal op-\neration that consistently loses money will not last very\nlong and thus presents a lesser danger than a profitable\noperation. But narrowing a money laundering statute so\nthat it reaches only profits produces two perverse results\nthat Congress cannot have wanted. First, it immunizes\nsuccessful criminal enterprises during those periods when\nthey are operating temporarily in the red. Second, and\nmore important, it introduces pointless and difficult prob-\nlems of proof. Because the dangers presented by money\nlaundering are present whenever criminals have large\nstores of illegally derived funds on their hands, there is\nlittle reason to require proof\u2014which may be harder to\nassemble than the plurality opinion acknowledges\u2014that\nthe funds represent profits.\n                             C\n  The implausibility of a net income interpretation is\nhighlighted in cases involving professionals and others\nwho are hired to launder money. Those who are knowl-\nedgeable about money laundering stress the importance of\nprosecuting these hired money launderers. See, e.g.,\nDepts. of Treasury and Justice, The 2001 National Money\nLaundering Strategy, pp. ix\u2013x, 1\u20132 (Sept. 2001), online at\nhttp://www.treas.gov/press/releases/docs/ml2001.pdf;   Fi-\nnancial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, 1996\u2013\n1997 Report on Money Laundering Typologies 7 (Feb.\n1997), online at http://www.fatf-gafi.org/dataoecd/31/29/\n34043795.pdf; Butterworths International Guide to Money\nLaundering Law and Practice 629 (T.

To violate 18 U. S. C. \u00a71956(a), a de-\nfendant must \u201ckno[w] the property involved in a financial\ntransaction represents the proceeds of some form of\nunlawful activity.\u201d A professional money launderer is not\nlikely to know (or perhaps even to care) whether the en-\nterprise is operating in the black when the funds in ques-\ntion were acquired. Therefore, under a net income inter-\npretation, financial specialists and others who are hired to\nlaunder funds would generally be beyond the reach of the\nstatute, something that Congress almost certainly did not\nintend.\n   It is revealing that the money laundering statute explic-\nitly provides that a money launderer need only know that\n\u201cthe property involved in the transaction represented\nproceeds from some form, though not necessarily which\nform, of [specified illegal] activity.\u201d \u00a71956(c)(1). Thus, the\nprosecution is not required to prove that a hired money\nlaunderer knew that funds provided for laundering de-\nrived from, say, drug sales as opposed to gambling. There\nis no reason to think that hired money launderers are\nmore likely to know whether funds include profits than\nthey are to know the nature of the illegal activity from\nwhich the funds were derived. Consequently, \u00a71956(c)\nsuggests that Congress did not intend to require proof that\na hired money launderer knew that funds provided for\nlaundering included profits.\n   The plurality opinion dismisses these concerns with the\nobservation that a jury may infer that a hired launderer\nknew that funds included profits if the launderer had a\nlong-running relationship with the entity or person provid-\ning the funds or knew that the entity or person had been\ninvolved in the illegal enterprise for a lengthy period. See\nante, at 14. But what about the case where the launderer\naccepts a million dollars of drug money on a single occa-\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

And even if there would be legally sufficient evi-\ndence to support an inference of the requisite knowledge\nunder the circumstances that the plurality opinion posits,\nthe requirement of convincing a jury to find beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the funds included profits would\npose a troublesome and (in light of the aim of the money\nlaundering statute) pointless obstacle.\n                              D\n   Even in cases in which the defendants are alleged to\nhave been involved in the underlying criminal activity, a\nnet income interpretation would produce nettlesome prob-\nlems that Congress cannot have wanted. These problems\nmay be especially acute in the very cases that money\nlaundering statutes principally target, that is, cases in-\nvolving large-scale criminal operations that continue over\na substantial period of time, particularly drug cartels and\nother organized crime syndicates.\n   The federal money laundering statute was enacted in\nthe wake of an influential report by the President\u2019s Com-\nmission on Organized Crime that focused squarely on\ncriminal enterprises of this type. See Interim Report 7\u20138\n(described in S. Rep. No. 99\u2013433, pp. 2\u20134 (1986) (hereinaf-\nter S. Rep.) and H. R. Rep., at 16). The Commission iden-\ntified drug traffickers and other organized criminal groups\nas presenting the most serious problems. See Interim\nReport 7. The Commission found that \u201cnarcotics traffick-\ners, who must conceal billions of dollars in cash from\ndetection by the government, create by far the greatest\ndemand for money laundering services\u201d but that \u201cnumer-\nous other types of activities typical of organized crime,\nsuch as loansharking and gambling, also create an appre-\nciable demand for such schemes.\u201d Ibid. To illustrate the\nscope and nature of the money laundering problem, a\nsection of the Interim Report was devoted to case studies,\nmost of which involved the laundering of drug money. Id.,\n10               UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nat 29\u201349.\n   As a prime example of the problem of money laundering,\nthe report discussed the so-called \u201cPizza Connection\u201d case\nthat was prosecuted in federal court in New York City in\nthe 1980\u2019s. In that case, the evidence showed that the\nSicilian Mafia and organized crime elements in the United\nStates, over a period of many years, imported huge\namounts of heroin into this country, sold the heroin here,\naccumulated millions of dollars of cash, and then laun-\ndered the funds by smuggling them overseas in suitcases\nor funneling the money through a maze of bank accounts.\nSee id., at 31\u201335; United States v. Casamento, 887 F. 2d\n1141, 1148\u20131149 (CA2 1989).\n   Following the issuance of the Interim Report, Congress\nturned its attention to the problem of money laundering,\nand much of the discussion focused on the need to prevent\nlaundering by drug and organized crime syndicates. See,\ne.g., S. Rep., at 3 (discussing \u201corganized crime \u2018businesses\u2019\nsuch as gambling, prostitution, and loansharking\u201d), 4\n(\u201cMoney laundering is a crucial financial underpinning of\norganized crime and narcotics trafficking\u201d (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)); Hearing on Money Laundering\nLegislation before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n99th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1985) (statement of Chairman\nThurmond); id., at 29 (statement of Sen.

Tracing funds back to par-\nticular drug sales and proving that these sales were prof-\nitable will often prove impossible. See United States v.\nBajakajian, 524 U. S. 321, 351\u2013352 (1998) (KENNEDY, J.,\ndissenting). Indeed, it will often be hard even to establish\nwith any precision the period of time during which the\ndrug sales occurred. But assuming that the Government\ncan prove roughly when the funds were acquired, the next\nhurdle would be to show that the drug ring had net income\nduring the time when the funds were acquired.\n   \u201cNet income\u201d means \u201c[t]he excess of revenues over all\nrelated expenses for a given period.\u201d R. Estes, Dictionary\nof Accounting 88 (1981) (emphasis deleted). There are no\ngenerally accepted accounting principles for determining\nthe net income of illegal enterprises, and therefore, in\norder to apply a net income interpretation, special ac-\ncounting rules would have to be developed.\n   In the drug-money cases that I have been discussing,\nthe courts would have to decide whether the drug syndi-\ncate\u2019s net income should be calculated on an annual, quar-\nterly, or some other basis. In addition, the courts would be\nforced to devise rules for determining the scope of the\nenterprise for which the net income calculation must be\nperformed. Suppose, for example, that there were connec-\ntions of an uncertain nature or degree between drug op-\nerations in different cities or countries. Rules would be\nneeded to determine whether affiliated criminal groups\nshould be regarded as one enterprise or several. And proof\nregarding the connections between such operations would\noften be very difficult to obtain. Criminal enterprises do\nnot have papers of incorporation, partnership agreements,\nor (in most instances) other documents establishing pre-\ncise business relationships.\n   Rules would also be needed in order to determine\nwhether particular illegal expenditures should be consid-\nered as expenses. In the \u201cPizza Connection\u201d case, the\n12               UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nSicilian Mafia used its income for such things as the mur-\nder of magistrates, police officers, witnesses, and rivals.\nSee, e.g., Casamento, supra, at 1154\u20131156; United States\nv. Gambino, 809 F. Supp. 1061, 1065\u20131068 (SDNY 1992).\nAre these expenditures simply a cost of engaging in the\ndrug trade? Are they business expenses?\n   If a net income interpretation were taken to its logical\nconclusion, it presumably would be necessary as well to\nwork out rules for the depreciation of instrumentalities of\ncrime that must occasionally be replaced due to the efforts\nof law enforcement. But it seems quite implausible that\nCongress wanted courts or juries in money laundering\ncases to grapple with questions such as the useful life of,\nsay, a drug processing plant or laboratory or the airplanes\nand boats that are used to smuggle drugs. And assuming\nthat the accounting issues can ultimately be resolved by\nthe courts, there would remain serious problems of proof.\nIllegal enterprises generally do not keep books and records\nlike legitimate businesses do.\n   It is tempting to dismiss many of the problems noted\nabove on the ground that \u201ceveryone knows\u201d that drug\ncartels, organized crime syndicates, and the like make a\nprofit. But such groups may not operate in the black at all\ntimes, and in any event, if net income is an element of the\nmoney laundering offense, the prosecution must prove net\nincome beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution can-\nnot simply ask the jury to take notice of the fact that these\ngroups are profitable.\n   My point in citing the accounting and proof problems\nthat would be produced by a net income interpretation is\nnot that the \u201c \u2018receipts\u2019 \u201d interpretation is preferable be-\ncause \u201cit is easier to prosecute,\u201d ante, at 11 (plurality\nopinion), but that creating these obstacles would serve no\ndiscernible purpose. Even if a drug or gambling ring was\ntemporarily operating in the red during a particular pe-\nriod, the laundering of money acquired during that time\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwould present the same dangers as the laundering of\nmoney acquired during times of profit. It is therefore\nimplausible that Congress wanted to throw up such point-\nless obstacles.\n   The plurality opinion attempts to minimize all these\nproblems by stating that \u201cto establish the proceeds ele-\nment under the \u2018profits\u2019 interpretation, the prosecution\nneeds to show only that a single instance of specified\nunlawful activity was profitable and gave rise to the\nmoney involved in a charged transaction.\u201d Ante, at 12.\nThis suggestion ignores both the language of the money\nlaundering statute, which makes no reference to an \u201cin-\nstance\u201d of unlawful activity, and the realities of money\nlaundering prosecutions. The prototypical money launder-\ning case is not a case in which a defendant engages in a\nsingle, discrete criminal act and then launders the money\nderived from that act\u2014for example, a case in which a\n\u201cfelon . . . uses . . . stolen money to pay for the rented\ngetaway car.\u201d Ante, at 8. Rather, the prototypical case\ninvolves numerous criminal acts that occur over a period\nof time and the accumulation of funds from all these acts\nprior to laundering\u2014for example, the organized crime\nsyndicate or drug cartel that amasses large sums before\nengaging in a laundering transaction.\n   Take, for example, a case in which a defendant is\ncharged with doing what was done in the \u201cPizza Connec-\ntion\u201d case\u2014transferring millions of dollars of drug money\noverseas, knowing that the funds represent the proceeds of\ndrug trafficking (\u201csome form of unlawful activity\u201d) and\nthat the transfer was designed to conceal the origin of the\nfunds. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(2). In such a case, it\nis unrealistic to think that individual dollars can be traced\nback to individual drug sales\u2014or that Congress wanted to\nrequire such tracing.\n   Although the plurality opinion begins by touting the\n\u201csingle instance\u201d theory as a cure for the accounting and\n14                 UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nproof problems that a \u201cprofits\u201d interpretation produces,\nthe plurality\u2019s application of the \u201csingle instance\u201d theory to\nthe case at hand shows that this theory will not work. In\nthis case, the \u201cunlawful activity\u201d that produced the funds\nat issue in the substantive money laundering counts was\nthe operation of the Santos lottery,6 and it is hardly ap-\nparent what constitutes a \u201csingle instance\u201d of running a\ngambling business. Did each lottery drawing represent a\nseparate \u201cinstance\u201d? Each wager? And how long does\neach gambling \u201cinstance\u201d last? A day? A week? A month?\n  When the plurality opinion addresses these questions, it\nturns out that \u201ca single instance\u201d means all instances that\nare charged, i.e., it means that the Government had to\nshow that receipts exceeded costs during the time the\ndefendant allegedly conducted, financed, etc., the gam-\nbling operation. See ante, at 13, n. 7. Here, since the\nIndictment alleged that the Santos lottery continued for\nmore than 6 years (\u201c[b]egining in or about January 1989\nand continuing to in or about December 1994, the exact\ndates being unknown to the Grand Jury\u201d),7 the plurality\nwould apparently compel the Government to prove that\nthe lottery was profitable over this entire period.\n  If this is where the \u201csingle instance\u201d theory leads, the\ntheory plainly does not solve the accounting and proof\nproblems we have noted. And the plurality\u2019s suggestion\nthat the Government had to show that the gambling op-\neration was profitable for this entire period leads to pre-\nposterous results. Suppose that the lottery was profitable\nfor the first five years and, at the end of each year, re-\nspondents laundered funds derived from the business.\nSuppose that in the sixth year the business incurred\nheavy losses\u2014losses so heavy that they wiped out all of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See Indictment in United States v. Alameda, No. 2:96 CR\u2013044 RL\n\n(ND Ind., May 10, 1996), pp. 3, 14\u201325 (hereinafter Indictment).\n  7 See id., at 3.\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

According to the\nplurality, if respondents were found to have operated the\nlottery during the entire 6-year period, then the financial\ntransactions that occurred at the end of years one, two,\nthree, four, and five would not violate the money launder-\ning statute, even though an accounting done at those\ntimes would have come to the conclusion that the funds\nincluded profits. That result makes no sense.\n   Whenever a money laundering indictment charges that\nthe laundered funds derived from an \u201cunlawful activity\u201d\nthat comprehends numerous acts that occurred over a\nconsiderable period of time\u2014and that is precisely the\nsituation in many of the types of cases that the money\nlaundering statute principally targeted\u2014the plurality\nopinion\u2019s interpretation will produce difficulties. I have\nalready discussed drug and gambling cases, and similar\nproblems will arise in cases in which the unlawful activity\nis a form of fraud. For example, the unlawful activity in\nmail fraud (18 U. S. C. \u00a71341) is the scheme to defraud,\nnot the individual mailings carried out in furtherance of\nthe scheme. See Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 19\n(1999); United States v. Mankarious, 151 F. 3d 694 (CA7\n1998). In such a case, what will constitute the \u201csingle\ninstance of unlawful activity\u201d? Will each mailing be a\nseparate \u201cinstance\u201d? The same problem arises with other\nfraud predicates, including wire fraud (\u00a71343), see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Zvi, 168 F. 3d 49 (CA2 1999), and finan-\ncial institution fraud (\u00a71344), see, e.g., United States v.\nFarr, 69 F. 3d 545 (CA9 1995).\n   The plurality opinion suggests that the application of a\nprofits interpretation will be easy in cases in which the\nfinancial transactions are payments of \u201cexpenses.\u201d Ante,\nat 9. But it may be no small matter to determine whether\nparticular payments are for \u201cexpenses.\u201d When the man-\nager of a gambling operation distributes cash to those who\nwork in the operation, the manager may be paying them\n16                    UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthe rough equivalent of a salary; that is, the recipients\nmay expect to receive a certain amount for their services\nwhether or not the operation is profitable. On the other\nhand, those who work in the operation may have the\nexpectation of receiving a certain percentage of the gross\nrevenue (perhaps even in addition to a salary), in which\ncase their distribution may include profits. Such was the\ncase in Santos\u2019 lottery, where the runners were paid a\npercentage of gross revenue. See Indictment 5; 16 Tr.\n1399 (Oct. 9, 1997).\n  The plurality opinion cites 18 U. S. C. \u00a71963(a) and 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7853(a), for the proposition that Congress has\n\u201celsewhere\u201d imposed the burden of proving that illegally\nobtained funds represent profits, but the plurality opin-\nion\u2019s examples are inapposite. Ante, at 12. Neither of\nthese provisions, however, requires a determination of net\nincome. Both provisions permit a fine in the amount of\n\u201cnot more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.\u201d\n18 U. S. C. \u00a71963(a). Thus, the term \u201cproceeds\u201d as used in\nthese provisions is not limited to profits.8\n   For all these reasons, I am convinced that the term\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 In 18 U. S. C. \u00a7981(a)(2)(B), which is a forfeiture provision of limited\n\nscope, Congress defines the term \u201cproceeds\u201d to mean net income.\nHowever, that definition applies only \u201c[i]n cases involving lawful goods\nor lawful services that are sold or provided in an illegal manner.\u201d\nCalculating net income in that situation is easier than it would be in\nmost money laundering cases, and it is noteworthy that Congress took\ncare to provide rules and procedures to be used in making the calcula-\ntion. See ibid. If Congress had intended to require proof of net income\nin money laundering cases, it is likely that Congress likewise would\nhave specified the rules and procedures to be used. It is noteworthy\nthat subparagraph (A) of \u00a7981(a)(2), which the plurality opinion does\nnot mention, provides that in cases that are more analogous to the\ntypical money laundering case, i.e., \u201ccases involving illegal goods [or]\nillegal services,\u201d the term \u201cproceeds\u201d \u201cmeans [any] property of any kind\nobtained directly or indirectly, as the result of the commission of the\noffense giving rise to forfeiture, and any property traceable thereto, and\nis not limited to the net gain or profit realized from the offense.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)          17\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cproceeds\u201d in the money laundering statute means gross\nreceipts, not net income. And contrary to the approach\ntaken by JUSTICE STEVENS, I do not see how the meaning\nof the term \u201cproceeds\u201d can vary depending on the nature of\nthe illegal activity that produced the laundered funds.\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n  It is apparent that a chief reason for interpreting the\nterm \u201cproceeds\u201d to mean net income in all money launder-\ning cases (the approach taken in the plurality opinion) or\nin some money laundering cases (the approach taken by\nJUSTICE STEVENS) is the desire to avoid a \u201cmerger\u201d prob-\nlem in gambling cases\u2014that is, to avoid an interpretation\nthat would mean that every violation of \u00a71955 (conducting\nan illegal gambling business) would also constitute a\nviolation of the money laundering statute, which carries a\nmuch higher maximum penalty (20 as opposed to 5 years\u2019\nimprisonment). This concern is misplaced and provides no\njustification for hobbling a statute that applies to more\nthan 250 predicate offenses and not just running an illegal\ngambling business.\n  First, the so-called merger problem is fundamentally a\nsentencing problem, and the proper remedy is a sentenc-\ning remedy. While it is true that the money laundering\nstatute has a higher maximum sentence than the gam-\nbling business statute, neither statute has a mandatory\nminimum. Thus, these statutes do not require a judge to\nincrease a defendant\u2019s sentence simply because the defen-\ndant was convicted of money laundering as well as run-\nning a gambling business. When the respondents were\nconvicted, their money laundering convictions resulted in\nhigher sentences only because of the money laundering\nSentencing Guideline, United States Sentencing Commis-\nsion, Guidelines Manual \u00a72S1.1 (Nov. 1997) (USSG),\n18                    UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwhich, in the pre-Booker 9 era, was mandatory. I agree\nwith JUSTICE BREYER, ante, at 2\u20133 (dissenting opinion),\nthat if a defendant is convicted of money laundering for\ndoing no more than is required for a violation of 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71955, the defendant\u2019s sentence should be no\nhigher than it would have been if the defendant had vio-\nlated only that latter provision. Insofar as the Guidelines\npreviously required\u2014and now advise in favor of\u2014a stiffer\nsentence, the obvious remedy is an amendment of the\nmoney laundering Guideline. And of course, now that the\nGuidelines are no longer mandatory, a sentencing judge\ncould impose the sentence called for by the Guideline that\napplies to the gambling business provision, see USSG\n\u00a72E3.1(a)(1) (Nov. 2007), or an entirely different sentence.\n   Second, the merger problem that the plurality opinion\nand JUSTICE STEVENS seek to avoid assumes the correct-\nness of the interpretation of the promotion prong of the\nmoney laundering statute that the Seventh Circuit\nadopted in Santos\u2019 direct appeal, i.e., that a defendant\n\u201cpromotes\u201d an illegal gambling business by doing those\nthings, such as paying employees and winning bettors,\nthat are needed merely to keep the business running. As\nSantos\u2019 brief puts it, the merger problem arises when the\ninterpretation of \u201cproceeds\u201d as gross receipts is\n\u201c[c]ombined with the Government\u2019s broad application of\nthe \u2018promotion\u2019 prong of the money laundering statute.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 6. But the meaning of the element of\npromotion is not before us in this case, and it would not\nmake sense to allow our interpretation of \u201cproceeds\u201d to be\ndictated by an unreviewed interpretation of another statu-\ntory element.\n   Third, even if there is a merger problem, it occurs in\nonly a subset of money laundering cases. The money\nlaundering statute reaches financial transactions that are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 9 United   States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005).\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

S. C. \u00a71956(a). The meaning of the term \u201cpro-\nceeds\u201d cannot vary from one money laundering case to the\nnext, and the plurality opinion and JUSTICE STEVENS\ninappropriately allow the interpretation of that term to be\ncontrolled by a problem that may arise in only a subset of\ncases.\n                             B\n  The plurality opinion defends its interpretation by\ninvoking the rule of lenity, but the rule of lenity does not\nrequire us to put aside the usual tools of statutory inter-\npretation or to adopt the narrowest possible dictionary\ndefinition of the terms in a criminal statute. On the con-\ntrary, \u201c[b]ecause the meaning of language is inherently\ncontextual, we have declined to deem a statute \u2018ambigu-\nous\u2019 for purposes of lenity merely because it was possible\nto articulate a construction more narrow than that urged\nby the Government.\u201d Moskal v.

As I have explained above, the\nmeaning of \u201cproceeds\u201d in the money laundering statute\nemerges with reasonable clarity when the term is viewed\nin context, making the rule of lenity inapplicable.\n                       *     *     *\n  For these reasons, I would reverse the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n",

See Ind.Code \u00a7 35-45-5-3 (West 2004). Santos employed a number of helpers to run the lottery. At bars and restaurants, Santos's runners gathered bets from gamblers, kept a portion of the bets (between 15% and 25%) as their commissions, and delivered the rest to Santos's collectors. Collectors, one of whom was respondent Diaz, then delivered the money to Santos, who used some of it to pay the salaries of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2023</span> collectors (including Diaz) and to pay the winners.</p>\n<p>These payments to runners, collectors, and winners formed the basis of a 10-count indictment filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, naming Santos, Diaz, and 11 others. A jury found Santos guilty of one count of conspiracy to run an illegal gambling business (\u00a7 371), one count of running an illegal gambling business (\u00a7 1955), one count of conspiracy to launder money (\u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and \u00a7 1956(h)), and two counts of money laundering (\u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i)). The court sentenced Santos to 60 months of imprisonment on the two gambling counts and to 210 months of imprisonment on the three money-laundering counts. Diaz pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money, and the District Court sentenced him to 108 months of imprisonment. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences. <i>United States v.

The District Court rejected all of their claims but one, a challenge to their money-laundering convictions based on the Seventh Circuit's subsequent decision in <i>United States v.

Applying that holding to respondents' cases, the District Court found no evidence that the transactions on which the money-laundering convictions were based (Santos's payments to runners, winners, and collectors and Diaz's receipt of payment for his collection services) involved profits, as opposed to receipts, of the illegal lottery, and accordingly vacated the money-laundering convictions. The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the Government's contention that <i>Scialabba</i> was wrong and should be overruled. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795559\"><a href=\"/opinion/795559/efrain-santos-and-benedicto-diaz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span> (C.A.7 2006).

Winterboer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117888\"><a href=\"/opinion/117888/asgrow-seed-co-v-winterboer/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 187, 115 S.Ct. 788, 130 L.Ed.2d 682 (1995). \"Proceeds\" can mean either \"receipts\" or \"profits.\" Both meanings are accepted, and have long been accepted, in ordinary usage. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 12 Oxford English Dictionary 544 (2d ed.1989); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1542 (2d ed.1987); Webster's New International Dictionary 1972 (2d ed.1957) (hereinafter Webster's 2d). The Government contends that dictionaries generally prefer the \"receipts\" definition over the \"profits\" definition, but any preference is too slight for us to conclude that \"receipts\" is the <i>primary</i> meaning of \"proceeds.\"</p>\n<p>\"Proceeds,\" moreover, has not acquired a common meaning in the provisions of the Federal Criminal Code. Most leave the term undefined. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853. Recognizing the word's inherent ambiguity, Congress has defined \"proceeds\" in various criminal provisions, but sometimes has defined it to mean \"receipts\" and sometimes \"profits.\" Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339C(e)(3) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (receipts), \u00a7 981(a)(2)(A) (2000 ed.) (same), with \u00a7 981(a)(2)(B) (profits).</p>\n<p>Since context gives meaning, we cannot say the money-laundering statute is truly ambiguous until we consider \"proceeds\" not in isolation but as it is used in the federal money-laundering statute. See <i>United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111984\"><a href=\"/opinion/111984/united-sav-assn-of-tex-v-timbers-of-inwood-forest-/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 371, 108 S.Ct. 626, 98 L.Ed.2d 740 (1988). The word appears repeatedly throughout the statute, but all of those appearances leave the ambiguity intact. Section 1956(a)(1) itself, for instance, makes sense under either definition: one can engage in a financial transaction with either receipts or profits of a crime; one can intend to promote the carrying on of a crime with either its receipts or its profits; and one can try to conceal the nature, location, etc., of either receipts or profits. The same is true of all the other provisions of this legislation in which the term \"proceeds\" is used. They make sense under either definition. See, for example, \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B), which speaks of \"proceeds\" represented by a \"monetary instrument or funds.\"</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO's dissent (the principal dissent) makes much of the fact that 14 States that use <i>and define</i> the word \"proceeds\" in their money-laundering statutes,<sup>[2]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2025</span> the Model Money Laundering Act, and an international treaty on the subject, all define the term to include gross receipts. See <i>post,</i> at 2036-2038. We do not think this evidence shows that the drafters of the federal money-laundering statute used \"proceeds\" as a term of art for \"receipts.\" Most of the state laws cited by the dissent, the Model Act, and the treaty postdate the 1986 federal money-laundering statute by several years, so Congress was not acting against the backdrop of those definitions when it enacted the federal statute. If anything, they show that \"proceeds\" is ambiguous and that others who believed that money-laundering statutes ought to include gross receipts sought to clarify the ambiguity that Congress created when it left the term undefined.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Under either of the word's ordinary definitions, all provisions of the federal money-laundering statute are coherent; no provisions are redundant; and the statute is not rendered utterly absurd. From the face of the statute, there is no more reason to think that \"proceeds\" means \"receipts\" than there is to think that \"proceeds\" means \"profits.\" Under a long line of our decisions, the tie must go to the defendant. The rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them. See <i>United States v. Gradwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98915\"><a href=\"/opinion/98915/united-states-v-gradwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 485, 37 S.Ct. 407, 61 L.Ed. 857 (1917); <i>McBoyle v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101695\"><a href=\"/opinion/101695/mcboyle-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931); <i>United States v.

This venerable rule not only vindicates the fundamental principle that no citizen should be held accountable for a violation of a statute whose commands are uncertain, or subjected to punishment that is not clearly prescribed. It also places the weight of inertia upon the party that can best induce Congress to speak more clearly and keeps courts from making criminal law in Congress's stead. Because the \"profits\" definition of \"proceeds\" is always more defendant-friendly than the \"receipts\" definition, the rule of lenity dictates that it should be adopted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Stopping short of calling the \"profits\" interpretation absurd, the Government contends that the interpretation should nonetheless be rejected because it fails to give the federal money-laundering statute its proper scope and because it hinders effective enforcement of the law. Neither contention overcomes the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>According to the Government, if we do not read \"proceeds\" to mean \"receipts,\" we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2026</span> will disserve the purpose of the federal money-laundering statute, which is, the Government says, to penalize criminals who conceal or promote their illegal activities. On the Government's view, \"[t]he gross receipts of a crime accurately reflect the scale of the criminal activity, because the illegal activity generated all of the funds.\" Brief for United States 21; see also <i>post,</i> at 2037-2039 (ALITO, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>When interpreting a criminal statute, we do not play the part of a mind reader. In our seminal rule-of-lenity decision, Chief Justice Marshall rejected the impulse to speculate regarding a dubious congressional intent. \"[P]robability is not a guide which a court, in construing a penal statute, can safely take.\" <i>United States v. Wiltberger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85284\"><a href=\"/opinion/85284/united-states-v-wiltberger/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 105, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820). And Justice Frankfurter, writing for the Court in another case, said the following: \"When Congress leaves to the Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an undeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity.\" <i>Bell v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105299\"><a href=\"/opinion/105299/bell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 83, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955).</p>\n<p>The statutory purpose advanced by the Government to construe \"proceeds\" is a textbook example of begging the question. To be sure, if \"proceeds\" meant \"receipts,\" one could say that the statute was aimed at the dangers of concealment and promotion. But whether \"proceeds\" means \"receipts\" is the very issue in the case. If \"proceeds\" means \"profits,\" one could say that the statute is aimed at the distinctive danger that arises from leaving in criminal hands the yield of a crime. A rational Congress could surely have decided that the risk of leveraging one criminal activity into the next poses a greater threat to society than the mere payment of crime-related expenses and justifies the money-laundering statute's harsh penalties.</p>\n<p>If we accepted the Government's invitation to speculate about congressional purpose, we would also have to confront and explain the strange consequence of the \"receipts\" interpretation, which respondents have described as a \"merger problem.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondent Diaz 34. If \"proceeds\" meant \"receipts,\" nearly every violation of the illegal-lottery statute would also be a violation of the money-laundering statute, because paying a winning bettor is a transaction involving receipts that the defendant intends to promote the carrying on of the lottery. Since few lotteries, if any, will not pay their winners, the statute criminalizing illegal lotteries, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955, would \"merge\" with the money-laundering statute. Congress evidently decided that lottery operators ordinarily deserve up to 5 years of imprisonment, \u00a7 1955(a), but as a result of merger they would face an additional 20 years, \u00a7 1956(a)(1). Prosecutors, of course, would acquire the discretion to charge the lesser lottery offense, the greater money-laundering offense, or both\u0097which would predictably be used to induce a plea bargain to the lesser charge.</p>\n<p>The merger problem is not limited to lottery operators. For a host of predicate crimes, merger would depend on the manner and timing of payment for the expenses associated with the commission of the crime. Few crimes are entirely free of cost, and costs are not always paid in advance. Anyone who pays for the costs of a crime with its proceeds\u0097for example, the felon who uses the stolen money to pay for the rented getaway car\u0097would violate the money-laundering statute. And any wealth-acquiring crime with multiple participants would become money-laundering when the initial recipient of the wealth gives his confederates their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2027</span> shares.<sup>[4]</sup> Generally speaking, any specified unlawful activity, an episode of which includes transactions which are not elements of the offense and in which a participant passes receipts on to someone else, would merge with money laundering. There are more than 250 predicate offenses for the money-laundering statute, see Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, M. Motivans, Money Laundering Offenders 1994-2001, p. 2 (2003), online at http:// www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/mlo01.pdf (as visited May 29, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file), and many foreseeably entail such transactions, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(c)(7) (establishing as predicate offenses a number of illegal trafficking and selling offenses, the expenses of which might be paid after the illegal transportation or sale).</p>\n<p>The Government suggests no explanation for why Congress would have wanted a transaction that is a normal part of a crime it had duly considered and appropriately punished elsewhere in the Criminal Code to radically increase the sentence for that crime. Interpreting \"proceeds\" to mean \"profits\" eliminates the merger problem. Transactions that normally occur during the course of running a lottery are not identifiable uses of profits and thus do not violate the money-laundering statute. More generally, a criminal who enters into a transaction paying the expenses of his illegal activity cannot possibly violate the money-laundering statute, because by definition profits consist of what remains after expenses are paid. Defraying an activity's costs with its receipts simply will not be covered.</p>\n<p>The principal dissent suggests that a solution to the merger problem may be found in giving a narrow interpretation to the \"promotion prong\" of the statute: A defendant might be deemed not to \"promote\" illegal activity \"by doing those things ... that are needed merely to keep the business running,\" <i>post,</i> at 2044, because promotion (presumably) means doing things that will cause a business to grow. See Webster's 2d, p.1981 (giving as one of the meanings of \"promote\" \"[t]o contribute to the growth [or] enlargement\" of something). (This argument is embraced by Justice BREYER's dissent as well. See <i>post,</i> at 2034-2035.) The federal money-laundering statute, however, bars not the bare act of promotion, but engaging in certain transactions \"with the intent to promote <i>the carrying on</i> of specified unlawful activity.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added). In that context the word naturally bears one of its other meanings, such as \"[t]o contribute to the ... prosperity\" of something, or to \"further\" something. See Webster's 2d, p.1981. Surely one promotes \"the carrying on\" of a gambling enterprise by merely assuring that it continues in business.<sup>[5]</sup> In any event, to believe <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2028</span> that this \"narrow\" interpretation of \"promote\" would solve the merger problem one must share the dissent's misperception that the statute applies just to the conduct of ongoing enterprises rather than individual unlawful acts. If the predicate act is theft by an individual, it makes no sense to ask whether an expenditure was intended to \"grow\" the culprit's theft business. The merger problem thus stands as a major obstacle to the dissent's interpretation of \"proceeds.\"</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER admits that the merger problem casts doubt on the Government's position, <i>post,</i> at 2034, but believes there are \"other, more legally felicitous\" solutions to the problem, <i>post,</i> at 2035. He suggests that the merger problem could be solved by holding that \"the money laundering offense and the underlying offense that generated the money to be laundered must be distinct in order to be separately punishable.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The insuperable difficulty with this solution is that it has no basis whatever in the words of the statute. Even assuming (as one should not) the propriety of a judicial rewrite, why should one believe that Congress wanted courts to avoid the merger problem in that unusual fashion, rather than by adopting one of the two possible meanings of an ambiguous term? Justice BREYER pins hope on the possibility, \"if the `merger' problem is essentially a problem of fairness in sentencing,\" that the United States Sentencing Commission might revise its recommended sentences for money laundering. <i>Post,</i> at 2034-2035. See also principal dissent, <i>post,</i> at 2044-2045 (in agreement). Even if that is a possibility, it is not a certainty. And once again, why should one choose this chancy method of solving the problem, rather than interpret ambiguous language to avoid it? In any event, as noted, <i>supra,</i> at 2026, the merger problem affects more than just sentencing; it affects charging decisions and plea-bargaining as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Government also argues for the \"receipts\" interpretation because\u0097quite frankly\u0097it is easier to prosecute. Proving the proceeds and knowledge elements of the federal money-laundering offense under the \"profits\" interpretation will unquestionably require proof that is more difficult to obtain. Essentially, the Government asks us to resolve the statutory ambiguity in light of Congress's presumptive intent to facilitate money-laundering prosecutions. That position turns the rule of lenity upside-down. We interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of defendants, not prosecutors.</p>\n<p>It is true that the \"profits\" interpretation demands more from the Government than the \"receipts\" interpretation. Not so much more, however, as to render such a disposition inconceivable\u0097as proved by the fact that Congress has imposed similar proof burdens upon the prosecution elsewhere. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(a) (criminal forfeiture provision requiring determination of \"gross profits or other proceeds\"); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a) (same).<sup>[6]</sup> It is untrue that the added burdens \"serve no discernible purpose.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2041 (ALITO, J., dissenting). They ensure that the severe money-laundering penalties will be imposed only for the removal of profits from criminal activity, which permit the leveraging <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2029</span> of one criminal activity into the next. See <i>supra,</i> at 2025-2026.</p>\n<p>In any event, the Government exaggerates the difficulties. The \"proceeds of specified unlawful activity\" are the proceeds from the conduct sufficient to prove <i>one</i> predicate offense. Thus, to establish the proceeds element under the \"profits\" interpretation, the prosecution needs to show only that a single instance of specified unlawful activity was profitable and gave rise to the money involved in a charged transaction. And the Government, of course, can select the instances for which the profitability is clearest. Contrary to the principal dissent's view, <i>post,</i> at 2038, 2040-2041, the factfinder will not need to consider gains, expenses, and losses attributable to other instances of specified unlawful activity, which go to the profitability of some entire criminal enterprise. What counts is whether the receipts from the charged unlawful act exceeded the costs fairly attributable to it.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>When the Government charges an \"enterprise\" crime as the predicate offense, see, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(c)(7)(C), it will have to prove the profitability of only the conduct sufficient to violate the enterprise statute. That is typically defined as a \"continuing series of violations,\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(c)(2), which would presumably be satisfied by three violations, see <i>Richardson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 818, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999). Thus, the Government will have to prove the profitability of just three offenses, selecting (again) those for which profitability is clearest. And of course a prosecutor will often be able to charge the underlying crimes instead of the overarching enterprise crime.</p>\n<p>As for the knowledge element of the money-laundering offense\u0097knowledge that the transaction involves profits of unlawful activity\u0097that will be provable (as knowledge must almost always be proved) by circumstantial evidence. For example, someone accepting receipts from what he knows to be a long-continuing drug-dealing operation can be found to know that they include some profits. And a jury could infer from a long-running launderer-criminal relationship that the launderer knew he was hiding the criminal's profits. Moreover, the Government will be entitled to a willful blindness instruction if the professional money launderer, aware of a high probability that the laundered funds were profits, deliberately avoids learning the truth about them\u0097as might be the case when he knows that the underlying crime is one that is rarely unprofitable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2030</span> IV</h2>\n<p>Concurring in the judgment, Justice STEVENS expresses the view that the rule of lenity applies to this case because there is no legislative history reflecting any legislator's belief about how the money-laundering statute should apply to lottery operators. See <i>post,</i> at 2032, 2033. The rule of lenity might not apply, he thinks, in a case involving an organized crime syndicate or the sale of contraband because the legislative history supposedly contains some views on the meaning of \"proceeds\" in those circumstances.<sup>[8]</sup> See <i>post,</i> at 2031-2032, and n. 3. In short, Justice STEVENS would interpret \"proceeds\" to mean \"profits\" for some predicate crimes, \"receipts\" for others.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS' position is original with him; neither the United States nor any <i>amicus</i> suggested it; it has no precedent in our cases. Justice STEVENS relies on the proposition that one undefined word, repeated in different statutory provisions, can have different meanings in each provision. See <i>post,</i> at 2032, and n. 2. But that is worlds apart from giving the same word, <i>in the same statutory provision,</i> different meanings <i>in different factual contexts.</i> Not only have we never engaged in such interpretive contortion; just over three years ago, in an opinion joined by Justice STEVENS, we forcefully rejected it. <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137741\"><a href=\"/opinion/137741/clark-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005), held that the meaning of words in a statute cannot change with the statute's application. See <i>id.,</i> at 378, 125 S.Ct. 716. To hold otherwise \"would render every statute a chameleon,\" <i>id.,</i> at 382, 125 S.Ct. 716, and \"would establish within our jurisprudence... the dangerous principle that judges can give the same statutory text different meanings in different cases,\" <i>id.,</i> at 386, 125 S.Ct. 716. Precisely to avoid that result, our cases often \"give a statute's ambiguous language a limiting construction called for by one of the statute's applications, even though other of the statute's applications, standing alone, would not support the same limitation. <i>The lowest common denominator, as it were, must govern.</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 380, 125 S.Ct. 716 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Our obligation to maintain the consistent meaning of words in statutory text does not disappear when the rule of lenity is involved. To the contrary, we have resolved an ambiguity in a tax statute in favor of the taxpayer in a civil case because the statute had criminal applications that triggered the rule of lenity. See <i>United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112745\"><a href=\"/opinion/112745/united-states-v-thompsoncenter-arms-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span>, 517-518, and n. 10, 112 S.Ct. 2102, 119 L.Ed.2d 308 (1992) (plurality opinion). If anything, the rule of lenity is an additional reason to remain consistent, lest those subject to the criminal law be misled. And even if, as Justice STEVENS contends, <i>post,</i> at 2031, statutory ambiguity \"effectively\" licenses us to write a brand-new law, we cannot accept that power in a criminal case, where the law must be written by Congress. See <i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2031</span> <i>States v. Hudson,</i> 7 Cranch 32, 34, 3 L.Ed. 259 (1812).</p>\n<p>We think it appropriate to add a word concerning the <i>stare decisis</i> effect of Justice STEVENS' opinion. Since his vote is necessary to our judgment, and since his opinion rests upon the narrower ground, the Court's holding is limited accordingly. See <i>Marks v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977). But the narrowness of his ground consists of finding that \"proceeds\" means \"profits\" when there is no legislative history to the contrary. That is all that our judgment holds. It does not hold that the outcome is different when contrary legislative history does exist. Justice STEVENS' speculations on that point address a case that is not before him, are the purest of dicta, and form no part of today's holding. Thus, as far as this particular statute is concerned, counsel remain free to argue Justice STEVENS' view (and to explain why it does not overrule <i>Clark v. Martinez, supra</i>). They should be warned, however: Not only do the Justices joining this opinion reject that view, but so also (apparently) do the Justices joining the principal dissent. See <i>post,</i> at 2036, 2044.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>The money-laundering charges brought against Santos were based on his payments to the lottery winners and his employees, and the money-laundering charge brought against Diaz was based on his receipt of payments as an employee. Neither type of transaction can fairly be characterized as involving the lottery's profits. Indeed, the Government did not try to prove, and respondents have not admitted, that they laundered criminal profits. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>When Congress fails to define potentially ambiguous statutory terms, it effectively delegates to federal judges the task of filling gaps in a statute. See <i>Commissioner v. Fink,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111935\"><a href=\"/opinion/111935/commissioner-v-fink/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 104, 107 S.Ct. 2729, 97 L.Ed.2d 74 (1987) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"In the process of legislating it is inevitable that Congress will leave open spaces in the law that the courts are implicitly authorized to fill\"). Congress has included definitions of the term \"proceeds\" in some criminal statutes,<sup>[1]</sup> but it has not done so in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 (2000 ed. and Supp. V), the money laundering statute at issue in this case. That statute is somewhat unique because it applies to the proceeds of a varied and lengthy list of specified unlawful activities, see \u00a7 1956(c)(7) (defining \"specified unlawful activity\" to include, <i>inter alia,</i> controlled substance violations, murder, bribery, smuggling, various forms of fraud, concealment of assets, various environmental offenses, and health care offenses).</p>\n<p>Although it did not do so, it seems clear that Congress could have provided that the term \"proceeds\" shall have one meaning when referring to some specified unlawful activities and a different meaning when referring to others. In fact, in the general civil forfeiture statute, \u00a7 981, Congress did provide two different definitions of \"proceeds,\" recognizing that\u0097for a subset of activities\u0097\"proceeds\" must allow for the deduction of costs. Compare \u00a7 981(a)(2)(A) (2000 ed.) (defining \"proceeds\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2032</span> in cases involving illegal goods and services to mean \"property of any kind obtained directly or indirectly ... not limited to the net gain or profit realized from the offense\") with \u00a7 981(a)(2)(B) (defining \"proceeds\" with respect to lawful goods sold in an illegal manner as the amount of money acquired \"less the direct costs incurred in providing the goods or services\").</p>\n<p>We have previously recognized that the same word can have different meanings in the same statute.<sup>[2]</sup> If Congress could have expressly defined the term \"proceeds\" differently when applied to different specified unlawful activities, it seems to me that judges filling the gap in a statute with such a variety of applications may also do so, as long as they are conscientiously endeavoring to carry out the intent of Congress. Therefore, contrary to what Justice ALITO and the plurality state, see <i>post,</i> at 2044 (dissenting opinion); <i>ante,</i> at 2030-2031 (plurality opinion), this Court need not pick a single definition of \"proceeds\" applicable to every unlawful activity, no matter how incongruous some applications may be.</p>\n<p>As Justice ALITO rightly argues, the legislative history of \u00a7 1956 makes it clear that Congress intended the term \"proceeds\" to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales.<sup>[3]</sup> But that history sheds no light on how to identify the proceeds of many other types of specified unlawful activities. For example, one specified unlawful activity is the conduct proscribed by \u00a7 541, \"Entry of goods falsely classified.\" Section 541 provides that \"[w]hoever knowingly effects any entry of goods, wares, or merchandise, at less than the true weight or measure thereof, or upon a false classification as to quality or value, or by the payment of less than the amount of duty legally due, shall be ... imprisoned not more than two years.\" Conceivably the \"proceeds\" stemming from a violation of \u00a7 541 could be either the money realized by misstating the value\u0097that is, the amount by which the criminal \"profits\" by paying reduced duties\u0097or the total price at which the goods are later sold, even though the misclassification had only a trivial impact on that price.</p>\n<p>Just as the legislative history fails to tell us how to calculate the \"proceeds\" of violations of \u00a7 541, it is equally silent on the proceeds of an unlicensed stand-alone gambling venture. The consequences of applying a \"gross receipts\" definition of \"proceeds\" to the gambling operation conducted by respondents are so perverse that I cannot believe they were contemplated by Congress, particularly given the fact that nothing in Justice ALITO's thorough review of the legislative history indicates otherwise.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Constrained by a holding that the payment of expenses constitutes \"promotion,\"<sup>[5]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2033</span> Justice ALITO's opinion runs squarely into what can be characterized as the \"merger\" problem. Allowing the Government to treat the mere payment of the expense of operating an illegal gambling business as a separate offense is in practical effect tantamount to double jeopardy, which is particularly unfair in this case because the penalties for money laundering are substantially more severe than those for the underlying offense of operating a gambling business. A money laundering conviction increases the statutory maximum from 5 to 20 years, and the Sentencing Commission has prescribed different Guidelines ranges for the two crimes.<sup>[6]</sup> When a defendant has a significant criminal history or Guidelines enhancements apply, the statutory cap of five years in \u00a7 1955 is an important limitation on a defendant's sentence\u0097a limitation that would be eviscerated if Justice ALITO's definition of \"proceeds\" were applied in this case.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO and Justice BREYER suggest that the advisory nature of the Guidelines post-<i>Booker, </i><i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), or the possibility of an amendment to the money laundering Guideline, would soften this blow, <i>post,</i> at 2044-2045 (opinion of ALITO, J.); <i>post,</i> at 2034-2035 (opinion of BREYER, J.), and indeed they could. But the result in the case at hand might not be softened at all by resort to <i>Booker</i> because respondents' direct appeal was decided in 2000, several years prior to our decision in <i>Booker.</i> If Justice ALITO's opinion were to carry the day, both respondents would return to prison to serve the remainder of their lengthy sentences.</p>\n<p>The revenue generated by a gambling business that is used to pay the essential expenses of operating that business is not \"proceeds\" within the meaning of the money laundering statute. As the plurality notes, there is \"no explanation for why Congress would have wanted a transaction that is a normal part of a crime it had duly considered and appropriately punished elsewhere in the Criminal Code, to radically increase the sentence for that crime.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2027. This conclusion dovetails with what common sense and the rule of lenity would require. Faced with both a lack of legislative history speaking to the definition of \"proceeds\" when operating a gambling business is the \"specified unlawful activity\" and my conviction that Congress could not have intended the perverse result that would obtain in this case under Justice ALITO's opinion, the rule of lenity may weigh in the determination. And in that respect the plurality's opinion is surely <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2034</span> persuasive.<sup>[7]</sup> Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I join Justice ALITO's dissent while adding the following observations about what has been referred to as the \"`merger problem.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2026 (plurality opinion). Like the plurality, I doubt that Congress intended the money laundering statute automatically to cover financial transactions that constitute an essential part of a different underlying crime. Operating an illegal gambling business, for example, inevitably involves investment in overhead as well as payments to employees and winning customers; a drug offense normally involves payment for drugs; and bank robbery may well require the distribution of stolen cash to confederates. If the money laundering statute applies to this kind of transaction (<i>i.e.,</i> if the transaction is automatically a \"financial transaction\" that \"involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity\" made \"with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\"), then the Government can seek a heavier money laundering penalty (say, 20 years), even though the only conduct at issue is conduct that warranted a lighter penalty (say, 5 years for illegal gambling). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1).</p>\n<p>It is difficult to understand why Congress would have intended the Government to possess this punishment-transforming power. Perhaps for this reason, the Tenth Circuit has written that \"Congress aimed the crime of money laundering at conduct that follows in time the underlying crime rather than to afford an alternative means of punishing the prior `specified unlawful activity.'\" <i>United States v. Edgmon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574983\"><a href=\"/opinion/574983/united-states-v-gary-a-edgmon-and-jimmy-w-edgmon/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span>, 1214 (1991). And, in 1997, the United States Sentencing Commission told Congress that it agreed with the Department of Justice that \"money laundering cannot properly be charged for `merged' transactions that are part of the underlying crime.\" Report to Congress: Sentencing Policy for Money Laundering Offenses, including Comments on a Dept. of Justice Report, p. 16 (Sept. 1997), online at http:// www.ussc.gov/r_congress/launder.pdf (as visited May 20, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).</p>\n<p>Thus, like the plurality, I see a \"merger\" problem. But, unlike the plurality, I do not believe that we should look to the word \"proceeds\" for a solution. For one thing, the plurality's interpretation of that word creates the serious logical and practical difficulties that Justice ALITO describes. See <i>post,</i> at 2038-2041 (dissenting opinion) (describing difficulties associated with proof and accounting). For another thing, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2035</span> there are other, more legally felicitous places to look for a solution. The Tenth Circuit, for example, has simply held that the money laundering offense and the underlying offense that generated the money to be laundered must be distinct in order to be separately punishable. <i>Edgmon, supra,</i> at 1214. Alternatively the money laundering statute's phrase \"with the intent <i>to promote</i> the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\" may not apply where, for example, only one instance of that underlying activity is at issue. (The Seventh Circuit on a prior appeal in this case rejected that argument, and thus we do not consider it here. See <i>United States v. Febus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769431\"><a href=\"/opinion/769431/united-states-v-roberto-febus-aka-bobby-santos-efr/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span>, 789 (2000).)</p>\n<p>Finally, if the \"merger\" problem is essentially a problem of fairness in sentencing, the Sentencing Commission has adequate authority to address it. Congress has instructed the Commission to \"avoi[d] unwarranted sentencing disparities\" among those \"found guilty of <i>similar criminal conduct.</i>\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991(b)(1)(B) (emphasis added); see also \u00a7 994(f) (instructing the Commission to pay particular attention to those disparities). The current money laundering Guideline, United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2S1.1 (Nov. 2007) (USSG), by making no exception for a situation where <i>nothing but a single instance of the underlying crime has taken place,</i> would seem to create a serious and unwarranted disparity among defendants who have engaged in identical conduct. My hope is that the Commission's past efforts to tie more closely the offense level for money laundering to the offense level of the underlying crime, see <i>id.,</i> Supp. to App. C, Amdt. 634 (Nov.2001), suggest a willingness to consider directly this kind of disparity. Such an approach could solve the \"merger\" problem without resort to creating complex interpretations of the statute's language. And any such solution could be applied retroactively. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(u).</p>\n<p>In light of these alternative possibilities, I dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice KENNEDY, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Fairly read, the term \"proceeds,\" as used in the principal federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a), means \"the total amount brought in,\" the primary dictionary definition. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1807 (1976) (hereinafter Webster's 3d). See also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1542 (2d ed.1987) (\"the total sum derived from a sale or other transaction\"). The plurality opinion, however, makes no serious effort to interpret this important statutory term. Ignoring the context in which the term is used, the problems that the money laundering statute was enacted to address, and the obvious practical considerations that those responsible for drafting the statute almost certainly had in mind, that opinion is quick to pronounce the term hopelessly ambiguous and thus to invoke the rule of lenity. Concluding that \"proceeds\" means \"profits,\" the plurality opinion's interpretation would frustrate Congress' intent and maim a statute that was enacted as an important defense against organized criminal enterprises.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Justice STEVENS's opinion recognizes that the term \"proceeds\" \"include[s] gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2023-2024 (opinion concurring in judgment).<sup>[1]</sup> I cannot agree with Justice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2036</span> STEVENS's approach insofar as it holds that the meaning of the term \"proceeds\" varies depending on the nature of the illegal activity that produces the laundered funds, but at least that approach preserves the correct interpretation of the statute in most of the cases that were the focus of congressional concern when the money laundering statute was enacted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>While the primary definition of the term \"proceeds\" is \"the total amount brought in,\" I recognize that the term may also be used to mean \"net profit,\" Webster's 3d 1807, and I do not suggest that the question presented in this case can be answered simply by opening a dictionary. When a word has more than one meaning, the meaning that is intended is often made clear by the context in which the word is used, and thus in this case, upon finding that the term \"proceeds\" may mean both \"the total amount brought in\" and \"net profit,\" the appropriate next step is not to abandon any effort at interpretation and summon in the rule of lenity. Rather, the next thing to do is to ask what the term \"proceeds\" customarily means in the context that is relevant here\u0097a money laundering statute.</p>\n<p>The federal money laundering statute is not the only money laundering provision that uses the term \"proceeds.\" On the contrary, the term is a staple of money laundering laws, and it is instructive that in every single one of these provisions in which the term \"proceeds\" is defined\u0097and there are many\u0097the law specifies that \"proceeds\" means \"the total amount brought in.\"</p>\n<p>The leading treaty on international money laundering, the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (Convention), Nov. 15, 2000, 2225 U.N.T.S. 209 (Treaty No. I-39574), which has been adopted by the United States and 146 other countries,<sup>[2]</sup> is instructive. This treaty contains a provision that is very similar to \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)(i). Article 6.1 of the Convention obligates signatory nations to criminalize \"[t]he ... transfer of property, knowing that such property is <i>the proceeds of crime,</i> for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or of helping any person who is involved in the commission of the predicate offence to evade the legal consequences of his or her action.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 277 (emphasis added). The Convention defines the term \"proceeds\" to mean \"any property derived from or obtained, directly or indirectly, through the commission of an offence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 275 (Art. 2(e)). The money laundering provision of the Convention thus covers gross receipts.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2037</span> The term \"proceeds\" is given a similarly broad scope in the Model Money Laundering Act (Model Act). See President's Commission on Model State Drug Laws, Economic Remedies, \u00a7 C (1993). Section 5(a)(1) of the Model Act criminalizes transactions involving property that is \"the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,\" and the Model Act defines \"proceeds\" as \"property acquired or derived directly or indirectly from, produced through, realized through, or caused by an act or omission... includ[ing] any property of any kind,\" \u00a7 4(a).</p>\n<p>Fourteen States have money laundering statutes that define the term \"proceeds,\" and in every one of these laws the term is defined in a way that encompasses gross receipts. See Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 13-2314(N)(3) (West 2001), 13-2317(F)(4)(b) (West Supp.2007); Ark.Code Ann. \u00a7 5-42-203(5) (2006); Cal.

It strongly suggests that when lawmakers, knowledgeable about the nature and problem of money laundering, use the term \"proceeds\" in a money laundering provision, they customarily mean for the term to reach all receipts and not just profits.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2038</span> B</h2>\n<p>There is a very good reason for this uniform pattern of usage. Money laundering provisions serve two chief ends. First, they provide deterrence by preventing drug traffickers and other criminals who amass large quantities of cash from using these funds \"to support a luxurious lifestyle\" or otherwise to enjoy the fruits of their crimes. Model Act, Policy Statement, p. C-105. See President's Commission on Organized Crime, Interim Report to President and Attorney General, The Cash Connection: Organized Crime, Financial Institutions, and Money Laundering 7-8 (Oct.1984) (hereinafter Interim Report); Aranson, Bouker, &amp; Hannon, Money Laundering, 31 Am.Crim. L.Rev. 721, 721-722 (1994); H.R.Rep. No. 99-746, p. 16 (1986) (hereinafter H.R. Rep.). Second, they inhibit the growth of criminal enterprises by preventing the use of dirty money to promote the enterprise's growth. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), (a)(2)(A), and (a)(3)(A); Model Act \u00a7\u00a7 5(a)(2), (4); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:21-25(b)(1); Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 34.02(a)(3)(4).</p>\n<p>Both of these objectives are frustrated if a money laundering statute is limited to profits. Dirty money may be used to support \"a luxurious lifestyle\" and to grow an illegal enterprise whenever the enterprise possesses large amounts of illegally obtained cash. And illegal enterprises may acquire such cash while engaging in unlawful activity that is unprofitable.</p>\n<p>Suppose, for example, that a drug cartel sends a large shipment of drugs to this country, a good part of the shipment is intercepted, the remainder is sold, the cartel ends up with a net loss but with a large quantity of cash on its hands, and the cartel uses the cash in financial transactions that are designed to conceal the source of the cash or to promote further crime. There is no plausible reason why Congress would not have wanted the money laundering statute to apply to these financial transactions. If the cartel leaders use the money to live in luxury, this provides an incentive for these individuals to stay in the business and for others to enter. If the cartel uses the money to finance future drug shipments or to expand the business, public safety is harmed.</p>\n<p>It is certainly true that Congress, in enacting the federal money laundering statute, was primarily concerned about criminal enterprises that realize profits. A criminal operation that consistently loses money will not last very long and thus presents a lesser danger than a profitable operation. But narrowing a money laundering statute so that it reaches only profits produces two perverse results that Congress cannot have wanted. First, it immunizes successful criminal enterprises during those periods when they are operating temporarily in the red. Second, and more important, it introduces pointless and difficult problems of proof. Because the dangers presented by money laundering are present whenever criminals have large stores of illegally derived funds on their hands, there is little reason to require proof\u0097which may be harder to assemble than the plurality opinion acknowledges\u0097 that the funds represent profits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The implausibility of a net income interpretation is highlighted in cases involving professionals and others who are hired to launder money. Those who are knowledgeable about money laundering stress the importance of prosecuting these hired money launderers. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Depts. of Treasury and Justice, The 2001 National Money Laundering Strategy, pp. ix-x, 1-2 (Sept.2001), online at http://www.treas.gov/ press/releases/docs/ml2001.pdf; Financial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2039</span> Action Task Force on Money Laundering, 1996-1997 Report on Money Laundering Typologies 7 (Feb.1997), online at http:// www.fatf-gafi.org/dataoecd/31/29/ 34043795.pdf; Butterworths International Guide to Money Laundering Law and Practice 629 (T. Graham 2d ed.2003); Ratliff, Third Party Money Laundering: Problems of Proof and Prosecutorial Discretion, 7 Stan. L. &amp; Policy Rev. 173 (1996); Sultzer, Money Laundering: The Scope of the Problem and Attempts to Combat It, 63 Tenn. L.Rev. 143, 147-148 (1995); H. R. Rep., at 16-17.</p>\n<p>A net income interpretation would risk hamstringing such prosecutions. To violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a), a defendant must \"kno[w] the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity.\" A professional money launderer is not likely to know (or perhaps even to care) whether the enterprise is operating in the black when the funds in question were acquired. Therefore, under a net income interpretation, financial specialists and others who are hired to launder funds would generally be beyond the reach of the statute, something that Congress almost certainly did not intend.</p>\n<p>It is revealing that the money laundering statute explicitly provides that a money launderer need only know that \"the property involved in the transaction represented proceeds from some form, though not necessarily which form, of [specified illegal] activity.\" \u00a7 1956(c)(1). Thus, the prosecution is not required to prove that a hired money launderer knew that funds provided for laundering derived from, say, drug sales as opposed to gambling. There is no reason to think that hired money launderers are more likely to know whether funds include profits than they are to know the nature of the illegal activity from which the funds were derived. Consequently, \u00a7 1956(c) suggests that Congress did not intend to require proof that a hired money launderer knew that funds provided for laundering included profits.</p>\n<p>The plurality opinion dismisses these concerns with the observation that a jury may infer that a hired launderer knew that funds included profits if the launderer had a long-running relationship with the entity or person providing the funds or knew that the entity or person had been involved in the illegal enterprise for a lengthy period. See <i>ante,</i> at 2029-2030. But what about the case where the launderer accepts a million dollars of drug money on a single occasion? And even if there would be legally sufficient evidence to support an inference of the requisite knowledge under the circumstances that the plurality opinion posits, the requirement of convincing a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the funds included profits would pose a troublesome and (in light of the aim of the money laundering statute) pointless obstacle.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>Even in cases in which the defendants are alleged to have been involved in the underlying criminal activity, a net income interpretation would produce nettlesome problems that Congress cannot have wanted. These problems may be especially acute in the very cases that money laundering statutes principally target, that is, cases involving large-scale criminal operations that continue over a substantial period of time, particularly drug cartels and other organized crime syndicates.</p>\n<p>The federal money laundering statute was enacted in the wake of an influential report by the President's Commission on Organized Crime that focused squarely on criminal enterprises of this type. See Interim Report 7-8 (described in S.Rep. No. 99-433, pp. 2-4 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2040</span> and H.R. Rep., at 16). The Commission identified drug traffickers and other organized criminal groups as presenting the most serious problems. See Interim Report 7. The Commission found that \"narcotics traffickers, who must conceal billions of dollars in cash from detection by the government, create by far the greatest demand for money laundering services\" but that \"numerous other types of activities typical of organized crime, such as loansharking and gambling, also create an appreciable demand for such schemes.\" <i>Ibid.</i> To illustrate the scope and nature of the money laundering problem, a section of the Interim Report was devoted to case studies, most of which involved the laundering of drug money. <i>Id.,</i> at 29-49.</p>\n<p>As a prime example of the problem of money laundering, the report discussed the so-called \"Pizza Connection\" case that was prosecuted in federal court in New York City in the 1980's. In that case, the evidence showed that the Sicilian Mafia and organized crime elements in the United States, over a period of many years, imported huge amounts of heroin into this country, sold the heroin here, accumulated millions of dollars of cash, and then laundered the funds by smuggling them overseas in suitcases or funneling the money through a maze of bank accounts. See <i>id.,</i> at 31-35; <i>United States v. Casamento,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531010\"><a href=\"/opinion/531010/united-states-v-filippo-casamento-emanuele-palazzo/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span>, 1148-1149 (C.A.2 1989).</p>\n<p>Following the issuance of the Interim Report, Congress turned its attention to the problem of money laundering, and much of the discussion focused on the need to prevent laundering by drug and organized crime syndicates. See, <i>e.g.,</i> S. Rep., at 3 (discussing \"organized crime `businesses' such as gambling, prostitution, and loansharking\"), 4 (\"Money laundering is a crucial financial underpinning of organized crime and narcotics trafficking\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Hearing on Money Laundering Legislation before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 99th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1985) (statement of Chairman Thurmond); <i>id.,</i> at 29 (statement of Sen. Biden), 30 (statement of Sen. DeConcini), 31 (statement of Sen. D'Amato), 53 (statement of Assistant Attorney General Trott).</p>\n<p>In light of these concerns, it is most unlikely that Congress meant to enact a money laundering statute that would present daunting obstacles in the very sort of cases that had been identified as presenting the most pressing problems, that is, cases, like the \"Pizza Connection\" case, in which law enforcement intercepts cash or wire transfers of funds derived from drug sales or other unlawful activity that occurred over a period of time. The plurality opinion's interpretation of the term \"proceeds,\" however, would often produce such problems. Tracing funds back to particular drug sales and proving that these sales were profitable will often prove impossible. See <i>United States v. Bajakajian,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, 351-352, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Indeed, it will often be hard even to establish with any precision the period of time during which the drug sales occurred. But assuming that the Government can prove roughly when the funds were acquired, the next hurdle would be to show that the drug ring had net income during the time when the funds were acquired.</p>\n<p>\"Net income\" means \"[t]he excess of revenues over all related expenses for a given period.\" R. Estes, Dictionary of Accounting 88 (1981) (emphasis deleted). There are no generally accepted accounting principles for determining the net income of illegal enterprises, and therefore, in order to apply a net income interpretation, special accounting rules would have to be developed.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2041</span> In the drug-money cases that I have been discussing, the courts would have to decide whether the drug syndicate's net income should be calculated on an annual, quarterly, or some other basis. In addition, the courts would be forced to devise rules for determining the scope of the enterprise for which the net income calculation must be performed. Suppose, for example, that there were connections of an uncertain nature or degree between drug operations in different cities or countries. Rules would be needed to determine whether affiliated criminal groups should be regarded as one enterprise or several. And proof regarding the connections between such operations would often be very difficult to obtain. Criminal enterprises do not have papers of incorporation, partnership agreements, or (in most instances) other documents establishing precise business relationships.</p>\n<p>Rules would also be needed in order to determine whether particular illegal expenditures should be considered as expenses. In the \"Pizza Connection\" case, the Sicilian Mafia used its income for such things as the murder of magistrates, police officers, witnesses, and rivals. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Casamento, supra,</i> at 1154-1156; <i>United States v. Gambino,</i> 809 F.Supp. 1061, 1065-1068 (S.D.N.Y.1992). Are these expenditures simply a cost of engaging in the drug trade? Are they business expenses?</p>\n<p>If a net income interpretation were taken to its logical conclusion, it presumably would be necessary as well to work out rules for the depreciation of instrumentalities of crime that must occasionally be replaced due to the efforts of law enforcement. But it seems quite implausible that Congress wanted courts or juries in money laundering cases to grapple with questions such as the useful life of, say, a drug processing plant or laboratory or the airplanes and boats that are used to smuggle drugs. And assuming that the accounting issues can ultimately be resolved by the courts, there would remain serious problems of proof. Illegal enterprises generally do not keep books and records like legitimate businesses do.</p>\n<p>It is tempting to dismiss many of the problems noted above on the ground that \"everyone knows\" that drug cartels, organized crime syndicates, and the like make a profit. But such groups may not operate in the black at all times, and in any event, if net income is an element of the money laundering offense, the prosecution must prove net income beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution cannot simply ask the jury to take notice of the fact that these groups are profitable.</p>\n<p>My point in citing the accounting and proof problems that would be produced by a net income interpretation is not that the \"`receipts'\" interpretation is preferable because \"it is easier to prosecute,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2028 (plurality opinion), but that creating these obstacles would serve no discernible purpose. Even if a drug or gambling ring was temporarily operating in the red during a particular period, the laundering of money acquired during that time would present the same dangers as the laundering of money acquired during times of profit. It is therefore implausible that Congress wanted to throw up such pointless obstacles.</p>\n<p>The plurality opinion attempts to minimize all these problems by stating that \"to establish the proceeds element under the `profits' interpretation, the prosecution needs to show only that a single instance of specified unlawful activity was profitable and gave rise to the money involved in a charged transaction.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2029. This suggestion ignores both the language of the money laundering statute, which makes no reference to an \"instance\" of unlawful activity, and the realities of money <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2042</span> laundering prosecutions. The prototypical money laundering case is not a case in which a defendant engages in a single, discrete criminal act and then launders the money derived from that act\u0097for example, a case in which a \"felon ... uses ... stolen money to pay for the rented getaway car.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2026. Rather, the prototypical case involves numerous criminal acts that occur over a period of time and the accumulation of funds from all these acts prior to laundering\u0097for example, the organized crime syndicate or drug cartel that amasses large sums before engaging in a laundering transaction.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, a case in which a defendant is charged with doing what was done in the \"Pizza Connection\" case\u0097 transferring millions of dollars of drug money overseas, knowing that the funds represent the proceeds of drug trafficking (\"some form of unlawful activity\") and that the transfer was designed to conceal the origin of the funds. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(2). In such a case, it is unrealistic to think that individual dollars can be traced back to individual drug sales\u0097or that Congress wanted to require such tracing.</p>\n<p>Although the plurality opinion begins by touting the \"single instance\" theory as a cure for the accounting and proof problems that a \"profits\" interpretation produces, the plurality's application of the \"single instance\" theory to the case at hand shows that this theory will not work. In this case, the \"unlawful activity\" that produced the funds at issue in the substantive money laundering counts was the operation of the Santos lottery,<sup>[6]</sup> and it is hardly apparent what constitutes a \"single instance\" of running a gambling business. Did each lottery drawing represent a separate \"instance\"? Each wager? And how long does each gambling \"instance\" last? A day? A week? A month?</p>\n<p>When the plurality opinion addresses these questions, it turns out that \"a single instance\" means all instances that are charged, <i>i.e.,</i> it means that the Government had to show that receipts exceeded costs during the time the defendant allegedly conducted, financed, etc., the gambling operation. See <i>ante,</i> at 2029, n. 7. Here, since the Indictment alleged that the Santos lottery continued for more than 6 years (\"[b]egining in or about January 1989 and continuing to in or about December 1994, the exact dates being unknown to the Grand Jury\"),<sup>[7]</sup> the plurality would apparently compel the Government to prove that the lottery was profitable over this entire period.</p>\n<p>If this is where the \"single instance\" theory leads, the theory plainly does not solve the accounting and proof problems we have noted. And the plurality's suggestion that the Government had to show that the gambling operation was profitable for this entire period leads to preposterous results. Suppose that the lottery was profitable for the first five years and, at the end of each year, respondents laundered funds derived from the business. Suppose that in the sixth year the business incurred heavy losses\u0097losses so heavy that they wiped out all of the profits from the first five years. According to the plurality, if respondents were found to have operated the lottery during the entire 6-year period, then the financial transactions that occurred at the end of years one, two, three, four, and five would not violate the money laundering statute, even though an accounting done at those times would have come to the conclusion that the funds included <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2043</span> profits. That result makes no sense.</p>\n<p>Whenever a money laundering indictment charges that the laundered funds derived from an \"unlawful activity\" that comprehends numerous acts that occurred over a considerable period of time\u0097and that is precisely the situation in many of the types of cases that the money laundering statute principally targeted\u0097the plurality opinion's interpretation will produce difficulties. I have already discussed drug and gambling cases, and similar problems will arise in cases in which the unlawful activity is a form of fraud. For example, the unlawful activity in mail fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) is the scheme to defraud, not the individual mailings carried out in furtherance of the scheme. See <i>Neder v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 19, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999); <i>United States v. Mankarious,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756709\"><a href=\"/opinion/756709/united-states-v-samy-a-mankarious-and-thomas-k-mur/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (C.A.7 1998). In such a case, what will constitute the \"single instance of unlawful activity\"? Will each mailing be a separate \"instance\"? The same problem arises with other fraud predicates, including wire fraud (\u00a7 1343), see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Zvi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761781\"><a href=\"/opinion/761781/united-states-v-luiz-ben-zvi-and-roz-ben-zvi/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span> (C.A.2 1999), and financial institution fraud (\u00a7 1344), see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Farr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1253260\"><a href=\"/opinion/1253260/state-v-farr/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span> (C.A.9 1995).</p>\n<p>The plurality opinion suggests that the application of a profits interpretation will be easy in cases in which the financial transactions are payments of \"expenses.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2027. But it may be no small matter to determine whether particular payments are for \"expenses.\" When the manager of a gambling operation distributes cash to those who work in the operation, the manager may be paying them the rough equivalent of a salary; that is, the recipients may expect to receive a certain amount for their services whether or not the operation is profitable. On the other hand, those who work in the operation may have the expectation of receiving a certain percentage of the gross revenue (perhaps even in addition to a salary), in which case their distribution may include profits. Such was the case in Santos' lottery, where the runners were paid a percentage of gross revenue. See Indictment 5; 16 Tr. 1399 (Oct. 9, 1997).</p>\n<p>The plurality opinion cites 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(a) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a), for the proposition that Congress has \"elsewhere\" imposed the burden of proving that illegally obtained funds represent profits, but the plurality opinion's examples are inapposite. <i>Ante,</i> at 2028-2029. Neither of these provisions, however, requires a determination of net income. Both provisions permit a fine in the amount of \"not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(a). Thus, the term \"proceeds\" as used in these provisions is not limited to profits.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2044</span> For all these reasons, I am convinced that the term \"proceeds\" in the money laundering statute means gross receipts, not net income. And contrary to the approach taken by Justice STEVENS, I do not see how the meaning of the term \"proceeds\" can vary depending on the nature of the illegal activity that produced the laundered funds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>It is apparent that a chief reason for interpreting the term \"proceeds\" to mean net income in all money laundering cases (the approach taken in the plurality opinion) or in some money laundering cases (the approach taken by Justice STEVENS) is the desire to avoid a \"merger\" problem in gambling cases\u0097that is, to avoid an interpretation that would mean that every violation of \u00a7 1955 (conducting an illegal gambling business) would also constitute a violation of the money laundering statute, which carries a much higher maximum penalty (20 as opposed to 5 years' imprisonment). This concern is misplaced and provides no justification for hobbling a statute that applies to more than 250 predicate offenses and not just running an illegal gambling business.</p>\n<p>First, the so-called merger problem is fundamentally a sentencing problem, and the proper remedy is a sentencing remedy. While it is true that the money laundering statute has a higher maximum sentence than the gambling business statute, neither statute has a mandatory minimum. Thus, these statutes do not require a judge to increase a defendant's sentence simply because the defendant was convicted of money laundering as well as running a gambling business. When the respondents were convicted, their money laundering convictions resulted in higher sentences only because of the money laundering Sentencing Guideline, United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2S1.1 (Nov.1997) (USSG), which, in the pre-<i>Booker</i><sup>[9]</sup> era, was mandatory. I agree with Justice BREYER, <i>ante,</i> at 2034-2035 (dissenting opinion), that if a defendant is convicted of money laundering for doing no more than is required for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955, the defendant's sentence should be no higher than it would have been if the defendant had violated only that latter provision. Insofar as the Guidelines previously required\u0097and now advise in favor of\u0097a stiffer sentence, the obvious remedy is an amendment of the money laundering Guideline. And of course, now that the Guidelines are no longer mandatory, a sentencing judge could impose the sentence called for by the Guideline that applies to the gambling business provision, see USSG \u00a7 2E3.1(a)(1) (Nov.2007), or an entirely different sentence.</p>\n<p>Second, the merger problem that the plurality opinion and Justice STEVENS seek to avoid assumes the correctness of the interpretation of the promotion prong of the money laundering statute that the Seventh Circuit adopted in Santos' direct appeal, <i>i.e.,</i> that a defendant \"promotes\" an illegal gambling business by doing those things, such as paying employees and winning bettors, that are needed merely to keep the business running. As Santos' brief puts it, the merger problem arises when the interpretation of \"proceeds\" as gross receipts is \"[c]ombined with the Government's broad application of the `promotion' prong of the money laundering statute.\" Brief for Respondent 6. But the meaning of the element of promotion is not before us in this case, and it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2045</span> would not make sense to allow our interpretation of \"proceeds\" to be dictated by an unreviewed interpretation of another statutory element.</p>\n<p>Third, even if there is a merger problem, it occurs in only a subset of money laundering cases. The money laundering statute reaches financial transactions that are intended to promote more than 250 other crimes, <i>ante,</i> at 2027 (plurality opinion), as well as transactions that are intended to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of illegally obtained funds. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a). The meaning of the term \"proceeds\" cannot vary from one money laundering case to the next, and the plurality opinion and Justice STEVENS inappropriately allow the interpretation of that term to be controlled by a problem that may arise in only a subset of cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The plurality opinion defends its interpretation by invoking the rule of lenity, but the rule of lenity does not require us to put aside the usual tools of statutory interpretation or to adopt the narrowest possible dictionary definition of the terms in a criminal statute. On the contrary, \"[b]ecause the meaning of language is inherently contextual, we have declined to deem a statute `ambiguous' for purposes of lenity merely because it was <i>possible</i> to articulate a construction more narrow than that urged by the Government.\" <i>Moskal v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112511\"><a href=\"/opinion/112511/moskal-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 108, 111 S.Ct. 461, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990) (citing <i>McElroy v.

As I have explained above, the meaning of \"proceeds\" in the money laundering statute emerges with reasonable clarity when the term is viewed in context, making the rule of lenity inapplicable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 1956(a)(1) reads as follows: \"Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity ... (A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity ... shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both.\"\n</p>\n<p>Respondents were also convicted of conspiring to launder money under \u00a7 1956(h). Because the Government has not argued that respondents' conspiracy convictions could stand if \"proceeds\" meant \"profits,\" see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795559\"><a href=\"/opinion/795559/efrain-santos-and-benedicto-diaz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 889 (CA7 2006), we do not address that possibility.</p>\n<p>[2]  The majority of States with money-laundering laws, in fact, use \"proceeds\" <i>without defining it.</i> See Colo.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 18-18-408 (2007); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 896.101 (2006); Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 7-1-911, 7-1-915 (2004); Idaho Code \u00a7 18-8201 (Lexis 2004); Ill. Comp.

Courts in these States have not construed the term one way or the other. But cf. <i>State v. Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1072714\"><a href=\"/opinion/1072714/state-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 143 (Tenn.Crim.App. 2003) (linking \"proceeds\" with the defined term \"property\"). California might belong in this list, for it has a money-laundering provision in its Penal Code, in which it uses the term \"proceeds\" but does not define it. See Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 186.10 (West 1999). But California also has a more limited money-laundering statute that uses and defines \"proceeds.\" See Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 11370.9(h)(1) (West 2007). Maryland might belong on the list as well: Its general money-laundering statute defines \"proceeds\" simply to set a minimum value on the proceeds laundered, Md.Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 5-623(a)(5) (Lexis 2002) (\"money or any other property with a value exceeding $10,000\"), and its more limited money-laundering statute does not define the term, see \u00a7 11-304.</p>\n<p>[3]  The principal dissent also suggests that Congress thought \"proceeds\" meant \"receipts\" because the House of Representatives (but not the Senate) had passed a money-laundering bill that did not use the word \"proceeds\" but rather used and defined a term (\"criminally derived property\") that, perhaps, included receipts. See <i>post,</i> at 2037, n. 5. Putting aside the question whether resort to legislative history is ever appropriate when interpreting a criminal statute, compare <i>United States v. R.L. C.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112709\"><a href=\"/opinion/112709/united-states-v-rlc/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 306, n. 6, 112 S.Ct. 1329, 117 L.Ed.2d 559 (1992), with <i>id.,</i> at 307, 112 S.Ct. 1329 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), that bit of it is totally unenlightening because we do not know why the earlier House terminology was rejected\u0097because \"proceeds\" captured the same meaning, or because \"proceeds\" carried a narrower meaning?</p>\n<p>[4]  The Solicitor General suggests that this is the case even under the \"profits\" interpretation. See Reply Brief for United States 16; see also <i>post,</i> at 2042-2043 (ALITO, J., dissenting). That is not so, because when the \"loot\" comes into the hands of the later distributing felon his confederates' shares are (as to him) not profits but mere receipts subject to his payment of expenses.</p>\n<p>[5]  We note in passing the peculiarity that a dissent which rejects our interpretation of \"proceeds\" because knowledge of profits will be difficult to prove, suggests an interpretation of \"promotes\" that will require proving that a particular expenditure was intended, not merely to keep a business \"running,\" but to expand it. (\"You must decide, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, whether it is true beyond a reasonable doubt that the payoff of this winning bettor was not simply motivated by a desire to bring him and other current gambling customers back, but was meant to create a reputation for reliable payoff that would attract future customers.\")</p>\n<p>[6]  The principal dissent claims that these statutes do not require proof of profits because the Government could rely upon the \"other proceeds\" prong, which the dissent interprets to mean <i>all</i> proceeds, gross profits and everything else. See <i>post,</i> at 2043. We do not normally interpret a text in a manner that makes one of its provisions superfluous. But even if we did, these provisions would still establish what the dissent believes unthinkable: that Congress could envision the Government's proving profits.</p>\n<p>[7]  The principal dissent asks, \"[H]ow long does each gambling `instance' last?\" <i>Post,</i> at 2042. The answer is \"as long as the Government chooses to charge.\" Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955(a) provides that \"[w]hoever conducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an illegal gambling business shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\" An illegal gambling business is an illegal gambling business during each moment of its operation, and it will be up to the Government to select that period of time for which it can most readily establish the necessary elements of the charged offenses, including (if money laundering is one of them) profitability. (To the extent this raises the possibility of the Government's making multiple violations out of one person's running of a single business, that problem arises no matter what definition of \"proceeds\" is adopted.) The \"preposterous results\" that the dissent attributes to our interpretation of \"proceeds,\" <i>post,</i> at 2042, are in fact the consequence of the Government's decision to charge Santos with conducting a gambling business over a 6-year period. Of course in the vast majority of cases, establishing the profitability of the predicate offense will not put the Government to the task of identifying the relevant period. Most criminal statutes prohibit discrete, individual acts (fraud, bank robbery) rather than the conduct of a business.</p>\n<p>[8]  Justice STEVENS fails to identify the legislative history to which he refers. He offers only: \"As Justice ALITO rightly argues, the legislative history of \u00a7 1956 makes it clear that Congress intended the term `proceeds' to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2035-2036. Although Justice ALITO, from one item of legislative history, draws an inference about the meaning of \"proceeds\" in all its applications (which we find dubious, see n. 3, <i>supra</i>), nowhere does he cite legislative history addressing the meaning of the word \"proceeds\" in cases specifically involving contraband or organized crime. Thus Justice STEVENS' concurrence appears to address not only a hypothetical case, see <i>infra,</i> at 2030, but even an imagined legislative history.</p>\n<p>[1]  For example, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339C(e)(3) (2000 ed., Supp. V), which prohibits the concealment of proceeds derived from funds used to support terrorism, defines \"proceeds\" to mean \"any funds derived from or obtained, directly or indirectly, through the commission of [the] offense.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  See, <i>e.g., </i><i>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131162\"><a href=\"/opinion/131162/general-dynamics-land-systems-inc-v-cline/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 595, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004) (rejecting the presumption that the term \"age\" had an identical meaning throughout the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967).</p>\n<p>[3]  Thus, I cannot agree with the plurality that the rule of lenity must apply to the definition of \"proceeds\" for these types of unlawful activities.</p>\n<p>[4]  As Justice ALITO notes, some reference was made in the legislative history to gambling as a part of a broader criminal syndicate's activities. <i>Post,</i> at 2040. But that reference does not indicate that Congress intended the \"proceeds\" of a gambling business to include gross receipts.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Seventh Circuit held on a prior appeal that respondent Santos' actions were legally sufficient to convict him of promoting the carrying on of a business under \u00a7 1956, <i>United States v. Febus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769431\"><a href=\"/opinion/769431/united-states-v-roberto-febus-aka-bobby-santos-efr/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span>, 789-790 (2000). Justice ALITO criticizes the plurality for allowing the interpretation of \"proceeds\" to be \"dictated by an unreviewed interpretation of another statutory element.\" See <i>post,</i> at 2044-2045. I do not base my opinion on any disagreement with the interpretation of \"promotion.\"</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, under the 2007 Guidelines, the base offense level for running a gambling business is 12. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2E3.1 (Nov.2007) (USSG). Section 2S1.1, which provides the base offense level for money laundering, adds 2 levels to the base offense level for the underlying crime where the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956. This scheme for determining the base offense level first appeared in the November 2001 Sentencing Guidelines. Prior to 2001, the difference between sentences for gambling and money laundering was even more pronounced, as USSG \u00a7 2S1.1 (Nov.2000) set an offense level of 23, which could be increased if the value of the funds exceeded $100,000.</p>\n<p>[7]  In what can only be characterized as the \"purest of dicta,\" the plurality speculates about the <i>stare decisis</i> effect of our judgment and interprets my conclusion as resting on the ground that \"`proceeds' means `profits' when there is no legislative history to the contrary.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2031. That is not correct; my conclusion rests on my conviction that Congress could not have intended the perverse result that the dissent's rule would produce if its definition of \"proceeds\" were applied to the operation of an unlicensed gambling business. In other applications of the statute not involving such a perverse result, I would presume that the legislative history summarized by Justice ALITO reflects the intent of the enacting Congress. See <i>post,</i> at 2035-2036 and n. 1 (opinion of ALITO, J.). Its decision to leave the term undefined is consistent with my view that \"proceeds\" need not be given the same definition when applied to each of the numerous specified unlawful activities that produce unclean money. <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137741\"><a href=\"/opinion/137741/clark-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005), poses no barrier to this conclusion. In <i>Martinez</i> there was no compelling reason\u0097in stark contrast to the situation here\u0097to believe that Congress intended the result for which the Government argued.</p>\n<p>[1]  In light of the plurality opinion's discussion of \"the <i>stare decisis</i> effect of Justice STEVENS' opinion,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2031, it must be noted that five Justices agree with the position taken by Justice STEVENS on the matter discussed in the preceding sentence of the text.</p>\n<p>[2]  See Multilateral Treaties Deposited with the Secretary-General, pt. I, ch. XVIII, No. 12, United Nations Convention against Transnational Crime (Nov. 15, 2007), online at http://untreaty.un.org/ ENGLISH / bible / englishinternetbible / partI /chapterXVIII/ treaty13.asp (all Internet materials as visited May 29, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).</p>\n<p>[3]  If 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 were limited to profits, it would be narrower than the obligation that the United States undertook in Article 6.1 of the Convention, but the Department of State has taken the position that no new legislation is needed to bring the United States into compliance. See Hearing on Law Enforcement Treaties before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (2004) (statement of Samuel M. Witten, Deputy Legal Adviser (\"[W]e can comply with the Convention's criminalization obligations without the need for new legislation\")).</p>\n<p>[4]  Connecticut, the only State with a money laundering statute that does not use the term \"proceeds,\" uses equivalent language that is not limited to profits. See Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 53a-276 (2005) (\"A person is guilty for money laundering in the first degree when he exchanges ... one or more monetary instruments derived from criminal conduct constituting a felony\"). I have found no money laundering statute that defines \"proceeds\" to mean profits or that uses other language that limits the law's reach to profits or net income.\n</p>\n<p>The only state money laundering statute the even uses the term \"profits,\" \"net income,\" or something similar is that of Arkansas, which plainly defines \"criminal proceeds\" to include all gross receipts of criminal conduct: \"`Criminal proceeds' means: (A) Anything of value furnished or intended to be furnished in exchange for criminal conduct or contraband received in violation of state or federal law; and (B) Property or profits traceable to\" such an exchange. Ark.Code Ann. \u00a7 5-42-203(5) (2006).</p>\n<p>[5]  The version of the money laundering statute originally passed by the House reflected a similar legislative judgment. The bill made it a crime to engage in financial transactions and certain commercial transactions involving \"criminally derived property that is derived from a designated offense.\" H.R. 5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 602, p. 154 (1986) (as introduced). The term \"criminally derived property\" is naturally understood to include all property that is \"receive[d]\" or \"obtain[ed]\" as a result of criminal activity, see Webster's 3d 609; Random House Dictionary of the English Language 389 (1967), and thus to include all gross receipts and not just profit. The House bill defined the term \"criminally derived property\" to mean \"any property constituting, or derived from, <i>proceeds</i> obtained from a criminal offense.\" H.R. 5484, \u00a7 602, at 158 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the House seems to have understood \"proceeds\" to include gross receipts.\n</p>\n<p>The bill passed by the Senate, like the current money laundering statute, simply used the term \"proceeds,\" S. 2683, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 2(a) (1986), and the House acceded to the Senate version. See H.R. 5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 1352, p. 48 (1986) (as enacted). There is no suggestion in the legislative history that the term \"criminally derived property\" and the term \"proceeds\" were perceived as having different meanings.</p>\n<p>[6]  See Indictment in <i>United States v. Alameda,</i> No. 2:96 CR-044 RL (ND Ind., May 10, 1996), pp. 3, 14-25 (hereinafter Indictment).</p>\n<p>[7]  See <i>id.,</i> at 3.</p>\n<p>[8]  In 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(a)(2)(B), which is a forfeiture provision of limited scope, Congress defines the term \"proceeds\" to mean net income. However, that definition applies only \"[i]n cases involving lawful goods or lawful services that are sold or provided in an illegal manner.\" Calculating net income in that situation is easier than it would be in most money laundering cases, and it is noteworthy that Congress took care to provide rules and procedures to be used in making the calculation. See <i>ibid.</i> If Congress had intended to require proof of net income in money laundering cases, it is likely that Congress likewise would have specified the rules and procedures to be used. It is noteworthy that subparagraph (A) of \u00a7 981(a)(2), which the plurality opinion does not mention, provides that in cases that are more analogous to the typical money laundering case, <i>i.e.,</i> \"cases involving illegal goods [or] illegal services,\" the term \"proceeds\" \"means [any] property of any kind obtained directly or indirectly, as the result of the commission of the offense giving rise to forfeiture, and any property traceable thereto, and is not limited to the net gain or profit realized from the offense.\"</p>\n<p>[9]  <i>United States v.
