KENNEDY ET AL.\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE\n            MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA\n\n       No. 07\u201377. Argued March 24, 2008\u2014Decided May 27, 2008\nSection 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) requires \u201ccovered ju-\n  risdictions\u201d to obtain preclearance from the District Court for the\n  District of Columbia or the Department of Justice (DOJ) before \u201cen-\n  act[ing] or seek[ing] to administer\u201d any changes in their practices or\n  procedures affecting voting.\n     Alabama is a covered jurisdiction. As of its November 1, 1964 cov-\n  erage date, state law provided that midterm vacancies on county\n  commissions were to be filled by gubernatorial appointment. In\n  1985, the state legislature passed, and the DOJ precleared, a \u201clocal\n  law\u201d providing that Mobile County Commission midterm vacancies\n  would be filled by special election rather than gubernatorial ap-\n  pointment. In 1987, the Governor called a special election for the\n  first midterm opening on the Commission postpassage of the 1985\n  Act. A Mobile County voter, Willie Stokes, filed suit in state court\n  seeking to enjoin the election, but the state trial court denied his re-\n  quest. Although Stokes immediately appealed to the Alabama Su-\n  preme Court, the special election went forward and the winner took\n  office. Subsequently, however, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed\n  the trial court\u2019s judgment, finding that the 1985 Act violated the\n  State Constitution.\n     When the next midterm Commission vacancy occurred in 2005, the\n  method of filling the opening again became the subject of litigation.\n  In 2004, the state legislature had passed, and the DOJ had pre-\n  cleared, a law providing for gubernatorial appointment as the means\n  to fill county commission vacancies unless a local law authorized a\n  special election. When the vacancy arose, appellee voters and state\n  legislators (hereinafter Kennedy) filed suit against the Governor in\n  state court, asserting that the 2004 Act had revived the 1985 Act and\n2                           RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cured its infirmity under the Alabama Constitution. Adopting Ken-\n    nedy\u2019s view, the trial court ordered the Governor to call a special elec-\n    tion. Before the election took place, however, the Alabama Supreme\n    Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order, holding that the 2004 Act did\n    not resurrect the 1985 Act. The Governor therefore filled the vacancy\n    by appointment, naming Commissioner Chastang to the open seat.\n    Kennedy then commenced this suit in Federal District Court. Invok-\n    ing \u00a75 of the VRA, she sought declaratory relief and an injunction\n    barring the Governor from filling the Commission vacancy by ap-\n    pointment unless and until Alabama gained preclearance of the\n    Stokes and Kennedy decisions. A three-judge District Court granted\n    the requested declaration in August 2006. It determined that the\n    \u201cbaseline\u201d against which any change should be measured was the\n    1985 Act\u2019s provision requiring special elections, a measure both pre-\n    cleared and put into \u201cforce or effect\u201d with the special election in 1987.\n    It followed, the District Court reasoned, that the gubernatorial ap-\n    pointment called for by Stokes and Kennedy ranked as a change from\n    the baseline practice; consequently, those decisions should have been\n    precleared. Deferring affirmative relief, the District Court gave the\n    State 90 days to obtain preclearance. When the DOJ denied the\n    State\u2019s request for preclearance, Kennedy returned to the District\n    Court and filed a motion for further relief. On May 1, 2007, the Dis-\n    trict Court vacated the Governor\u2019s appointment of Chastang to the\n    Commission, finding it unlawful under \u00a75 of the VRA. The Governor\n    filed a notice of appeal in the District Court on May 18.\nHeld:\n    1. Because the District Court did not render its final judgment un-\n til May 1, 2007, the Governor\u2019s May 18 notice of appeal was timely.\n Under \u00a75, \u201cany appeal\u201d from the decision of a three-judge district\n court \u201cshall lie to the Supreme Court,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973c(a), but the\n appeal must be filed within 60 days of a district court\u2019s entry of a fi-\n nal judgment, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a72101(b). Kennedy maintains that the\n District Court\u2019s August 2006 order qualified as a final judgment,\n while the Governor maintains that the District Court\u2019s final judg-\n ment was the May 1 order vacating Chastang\u2019s appointment. A final\n judgment \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for\n the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d Catlin v. United States,\n 324 U. S. 229, 233. The August 2006 order declared that preclear-\n ance was required for the Stokes and Kennedy decisions, but left un-\n resolved Kennedy\u2019s demand for injunctive relief. An order resolving\n liability without addressing a plaintiff\u2019s requests for relief is not fi-\n nal. See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U. S. 737, 742\u2013743.\n Pp. 9\u201310.\n    2. For \u00a75 purposes, the 1985 Act never gained \u201cforce or effect.\u201d\n                   Cite as: 553 U.

See Young v. Fordice, 520 U. S. 273,\n282\u2013283. Pp. 10\u201312.\n   (b) While not controlling here, three precedents addressing \u00a75\u2019s\nterm of art \u201cin force or effect\u201d provide the starting point for the\nCourt\u2019s inquiry. In Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379, the question\nwas what practice had been \u201cin force or effect\u201d in Canton, Mississippi,\non that State\u2019s 1964 coverage date. A 1962 state law required at-\nlarge elections for city aldermen, but Canton had elected aldermen by\nwards in 1961 and again in 1965. This Court held that the city\u2019s\n1969 attempt to move to at-large elections was a change requiring\npreclearance because election by ward was \u201cthe procedure in fact \u2018in\nforce or effect\u2019 in Canton\u201d on the coverage date. Id., at 395. Simi-\nlarly, in City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S. 125, the question\nwas what practice had been \u201cin force or effect\u201d in Lockhart, Texas, on\nthe relevant coverage date. The city had used a \u201cnumbered-post\u201d sys-\ntem to elect its city council for more than 50 years. Though the num-\nbered-post system\u2019s validity under state law was \u201cnot entirely clear,\u201d\nid., at 132, \u201c[t]he proper comparison [wa]s between the new system\nand the system actually in effect on\u201d the coverage date, \u201cregardless of\nwhat state law might have required,\u201d ibid. Finally, in Young v. Ford-\nice, the question was whether a provisional voter registration plan\nprecleared and implemented by Mississippi election officials, who be-\nlieved that the state legislature was about to amend the relevant law,\nhad been \u201cin force or effect.\u201d See 520 U. S., at 279. As it turned out,\nthe state legislature failed to pass the amendment, and voters who\nhad registered under the provisional plan were required to reregister.\nThis Court held that the provisional plan was a \u201ctemporary misappli-\ncation of state law\u201d that, for \u00a75 purposes, was \u201cnever \u2018in force or ef-\nfect.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 282. Young thus qualified the general rule of Perkins\nand Lockhart: A practice best characterized as nothing more than a\n\u201ctemporary misapplication of state law,\u201d is not in \u201cforce or effect,\u201d\neven if actually implemented by state election officials, 520 U. S., at\n282. Pp. 12\u201315.\n     (c) If the only relevant factors were the length of time a practice\nwas in use and the degree to which it was implemented, this would\nbe a close case under Perkins, Lockhart, and Young. But an extraor-\n4                          RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    dinary circumstance not present in any past case is operative here,\n    impelling the conclusion that the 1985 Act was never \u201cin force or ef-\n    fect\u201d: The Act was challenged in state court at first opportunity, the\n    lone election was held in the shadow of that legal challenge, and the\n    Act was ultimately invalidated by the Alabama Supreme Court.\n    These characteristics plainly distinguish this case from Perkins and\n    Lockhart, where the state judiciary had no involvement. The prompt\n    legal challenge and the State Supreme Court\u2019s decision also provide\n    strong cause to conclude that, in the \u00a75 context, the 1985 Act was\n    never \u201cin force or effect.\u201d A State\u2019s highest court is unquestionably\n    \u201cthe ultimate exposito[r] of state law.\u201d Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S.\n    684, 691. And because the State Supreme Court\u2019s prerogative to say\n    what Alabama law is merits respect in federal forums, a law chal-\n    lenged at first opportunity and invalidated by Alabama\u2019s highest\n    court is properly regarded as null and void ab initio, incapable of ef-\n    fecting any change in Alabama law or establishing a voting practice\n    under \u00a75. There is no good reason to hold otherwise simply because\n    Alabama\u2019s highest court did not render its decision until after an\n    election was held. To the contrary, practical considerations some-\n    times require courts to allow elections to proceed despite pending le-\n    gal challenges. Cf. Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 5\u20136 (per curiam).\n    Ruling otherwise would have the anomalous effect of binding Ala-\n    bama to an unconstitutional practice because of the state trial court\u2019s\n    error. The trial court misconstrued the State\u2019s law and, due to that\n    court\u2019s error, an election took place. That sequence of events, the\n    District Court held, made the 1985 Act part of Alabama\u2019s \u00a75 baseline.\n    In essence, the District Court\u2019s decision gave controlling effect to the\n    erroneous trial court ruling and rendered the Alabama Supreme\n    Court\u2019s corrections inoperative. That sort of interference with a state\n    supreme court\u2019s ability to determine the content of state law is more\n    than a hypothetical concern. The realities of election litigation are\n    such that lower state courts often allow elections to proceed based on\n    erroneous interpretations of state law later corrected on appeal. The\n    Court declines to adopt a rigid interpretation of \u201cin force or effect\u201d\n    that would deny state supreme courts the opportunity to correct simi-\n    lar errors in the future. Pp. 15\u201319.\n         (d) Although this Court\u2019s reasoning and the facts of this case\n    should make the narrow scope of the holding apparent, some cau-\n    tionary observations are in order. First, the presence of a judgment\n    by Alabama\u2019s highest court invalidating the 1985 Act under the State\n    Constitution is critical here. The outcome might be different were a\n    potentially unlawful practice simply abandoned by state officials af-\n    ter initial use in an election. Cf. Perkins, 400 U. S., at 395. Second,\n    the 1985 Act was challenged the first time it was invoked and struck\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                   5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  down shortly thereafter. The same result would not necessarily fol-\n  low if a practice were invalidated only after enforcement without\n  challenge in several previous elections. Cf. Young, 520 U. S., at 283.\n  Finally, the consequence of the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s Stokes de-\n  cision was to reinstate a practice\u2014gubernatorial appointment\u2014\n  identical to the State\u2019s \u00a75 baseline. Preclearance might well have\n  been required had the court instead ordered the State to adopt a\n  novel practice.

YVONNE KENNEDY ET AL.\nON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR\n          THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA\n                                 [May 27, 2008]\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case presents a novel question concerning \u00a75 of the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965. The setting, in a nutshell: A\ncovered State passed a law adopting a new election prac\u00ad\ntice, obtained the preclearance required by \u00a75, and held an\nelection. Soon thereafter, the law under which the elec\u00ad\ntion took place was invalidated by the State\u2019s highest\ncourt on the ground that it violated a controlling provision\nof the State\u2019s Constitution. The question presented: Must\nthe State obtain fresh preclearance in order to reinstate\nthe election practice prevailing before enactment of the\nlaw struck down by the State\u2019s Supreme Court? We hold\nthat, for \u00a75 purposes, the invalidated law never gained\n\u201cforce or effect.\u201d Therefore, the State\u2019s reversion to its\nprior practice did not rank as a \u201cchange\u201d requiring pre\u00ad\nclearance.\n                             I\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), 79 Stat. 437, as\namended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973 et seq., \u201cwas designed by\nCongress to banish the blight of racial discrimination in\nvoting, which ha[d] infected the electoral process in parts\n2                     RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof our country for nearly a century.\u201d South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308 (1966). In three earlier\nstatutes, passed in 1957, 1960, and 1964, Congress had\nempowered the Department of Justice (DOJ or Depart\u00ad\nment) to combat voting discrimination through \u201ccase-by\u00ad\ncase litigation.\u201d Id., at 313. These lawsuits, however,\nmade little headway. Voting-rights suits were \u201cunusually\nonerous to prepare\u201d and the progress of litigation was\n\u201cexceedingly slow,\u201d in no small part due to the obstruction\u00ad\nist tactics of state officials. Id., at 314. Moreover, some\nStates \u201cresorted to the extraordinary stratagem of contriv\u00ad\ning new rules of various kinds for the sole purpose of\nperpetuating voting discrimination in the face of adverse\nfederal court decrees.\u201d Id., at 335.\n   The VRA reflected Congress\u2019 determination that\n\u201csterner and more elaborate measures\u201d were needed to\ncounteract these formidable hindrances. Id., at 309.\nSections 4 and 5 impose the most stringent of the Act\u2019s\nremedies. Under \u00a74(b), as amended, a State or political\nsubdivision is a so-called \u201ccovered jurisdiction\u201d if, on one of\nthree specified coverage dates: (1) it maintained a literacy\nrequirement or other \u201ctest or device\u201d as a prerequisite to\nvoting, and (2) fewer than 50% of its voting-age citizens\nwere registered to vote or voted in that year\u2019s Presidential\nelection. 42 U. S. C. A. \u00a71973b(b) (Supp. 2007). Section\n4(a) suspends the operation of all such \u201ctest[s] or device[s]\u201d\nin covered jurisdictions. \u00a71973b(a) (main ed. and Supp.\n2007). Section 5 requires covered jurisdictions to obtain\nwhat has come to be known as \u201cpreclearance\u201d from the\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia or the DOJ\nbefore \u201cenact[ing] or seek[ing] to administer\u201d any altera\u00ad\ntion of their practices or procedures affecting voting.\n\u00a71973c(a) (Supp. 2007).\n   A change will be precleared only if it \u201cneither has the\npurpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging\nthe right to vote on account of race or color, or [because of\n                   Cite as: 553 U.

As amended in 2006, the statute defines \u201cpurpose\u201d\nto include \u201cany discriminatory purpose.\u201d 120 Stat. 581,\ncodified at 42 U. S. C. A. \u00a71973c(c) (Supp. 2007).\n   Congress took the extraordinary step of requiring cov\u00ad\nered jurisdictions to preclear all changes in their voting\npractices because it \u201cfeared that the mere suspension of\nexisting tests [in \u00a74(a)] would not completely solve the\nproblem, given the history some States had of simply\nenacting new and slightly different requirements with the\nsame discriminatory effect.\u201d Allen v. State Bd. of Elec-\ntions, 393 U. S. 544, 548 (1969). By putting the burden on\ncovered jurisdictions to demonstrate that future changes\nwould not be discriminatory, \u00a75 served to \u201cshift the advan\u00ad\ntage of time and inertia from the perpetrators of the evil to\nits victims.\u201d Katzenbach, 383 U.

Composed of three members elected by separate\ndistricts to four-year terms, the Commission has the power\nto levy taxes, make appropriations, and exercise other\ncounty-wide executive and administrative functions. See\nAla. Code \u00a711\u20133\u201311 (1975).\n  We set out first, as pivotal to our resolution of this case,\na full account of two disputes over the means of filling\nmidterm vacancies on the Commission. The first occurred\nbetween 1985 and 1988; the second began in 2004 and\nculminates in the appeal now before us.\n                            A\n   Alabama is a covered jurisdiction with a coverage date\nof November 1, 1964. See 30 Fed. Reg. 9897 (1965). As of\nthat date, Alabama law provided that midterm vacancies\non all county commissions were to be filled by gubernato\u00ad\nrial appointment. See Ala. Code \u00a712\u20136 (1959). The rele\u00ad\nvant provision was later recodified without substantive\nchange as Ala. Code \u00a711\u20133\u20136 (1975), which stated:\n      \u201cIn case of a vacancy, it shall be filled by appoint\u00ad\n    ment by the governor, and the person so appointed\n    shall hold office for the remainder of the term of the\n    commissioner in whose place he is appointed.\u201d\nIn 1985, however, the state legislature passed a \u201clocal law\u201d\nproviding that any vacancy on the Mobile County Com\u00ad\nmission occurring \u201cwith twelve months or more remaining\non the term of the vacant seat\u201d would be filled by special\nelection rather than gubernatorial appointment. 1985\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAla. Acts no. 85\u2013237 (1985 Act).2 The DOJ precleared this\nnew law in June 1985.\n   The first midterm opening on the Commission postpas\u00ad\nsage of the 1985 Act occurred in 1987, when the seat for\nDistrict One\u2014a majority African-American district\u2014\nbecame vacant. In accord with the 1985 Act, the Governor\ncalled a special election. A Mobile County voter, Willie\nStokes, promptly filed suit in state court seeking to enjoin\nthe election. The 1985 Act, he alleged, violated Art. IV,\n\u00a7105, of the Alabama Constitution, which provides that no\n\u201clocal law . . . shall be enacted in any case which is pro\u00ad\nvided for by a general law.\u201d On Stokes\u2019s reading, the 1985\nAct conflicted with \u00a7105 because the Act addressed a\nmatter already governed by Ala. Code \u00a711\u20133\u20136.\n   The state trial court rejected Stokes\u2019s argument and\nentered judgment for the state defendants. Stokes imme\u00ad\ndiately appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court and\nsought an order staying the election pending that court\u2019s\ndecision. The requested stay was denied and the special\nelection went forward in June 1987. The winner, Samuel\nJones, took office as District One\u2019s Commissioner in July\n1987. Approximately 14 months later, however, in Sep\u00ad\ntember 1988, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the\ntrial court\u2019s judgment. Finding that the 1985 Act \u201cclearly\noffend[ed] \u00a7105 of the [Alabama] Constitution,\u201d the court\ndeclared the Act unconstitutional. Stokes v. Noonan, 534\nSo. 2d 237, 238\u2013239 (1988).\n   The Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s decree cast grave doubt\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Under the Alabama Constitution, a \u201cgeneral\u201d law is \u201ca law which in\nits terms and effect applies either to the whole state, or to one or more\nmunicipalities of the state less than the whole in a class.\u201d Art. IV,\n\u00a7110. A \u201cspecial or private\u201d law is a law that \u201capplies to an individual,\nassociation or corporation.\u201d Ibid. A \u201clocal\u201d law is \u201ca law which is not a\ngeneral law or a special or private law.\u201d Ibid. The 1985 Act was a local\nlaw because it applied only to Mobile County; the remainder of the\nState continued to be governed by Ala. Code \u00a711\u20133\u20136 (1975).\n6                    RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non the legitimacy of Jones\u2019s election and, consequently, on\nhis continued tenure in office. The Governor, however,\ndefused any potential controversy by immediately invok\u00ad\ning his authority under Ala. Code \u00a711\u20133\u20136 and appointing\nJones to the Commission.\n                             B\n   The next midterm vacancy on the Commission did not\noccur until October 2005, when Jones\u2014who had been\nreelected every four years since 1988\u2014was elected mayor\nof the city of Mobile. Once again, the method of filling the\nvacancy became the subject of litigation. In 2004, the\nstate legislature had passed (and the DOJ had precleared)\nan amendment to Ala. Code \u00a711\u20133\u20136 providing that va\u00ad\ncancies on county commissions were to be filled by guber\u00ad\nnatorial appointment \u201c[u]nless a local law authorizes a\nspecial election.\u201d 2004 Ala. Acts no. 2004\u2013455 (2004 Act).\nWhen the 2005 vacancy arose, three Mobile County voters\nand Alabama state legislators\u2014appellees Yvonne Ken\u00ad\nnedy, James Buskey, and William Clark (hereinafter\nKennedy)\u2014filed suit against Alabama\u2019s Governor, Bob\nRiley, in state court. The 2004 Act\u2019s authorization of local\nlaws providing for special elections, they urged, had re\u00ad\nvived the 1985 Act and cured its infirmity under \u00a7105 of\nthe Alabama Constitution. Adopting Kennedy\u2019s view, the\nstate trial court ordered Governor Riley to call a special\nelection.\n   While the Governor\u2019s appeal to the Alabama Supreme\nCourt was pending, Mobile County\u2019s election officials\nobtained preclearance of procedures for a special election,\nscheduled to take place in January 2006. In November\n2005, however, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the\ntrial court\u2019s order. Holding that the 2004 Act \u201cprovide[d]\nfor prospective application only\u201d and thus did not resur\u00ad\nrect the 1985 Act, Alabama\u2019s highest court ruled that\n\u201cGovernor Riley [wa]s authorized to fill the vacancy on the\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMobile County Commission by appointment.\u201d Riley v.\nKennedy, 928 So. 2d 1013, 1017 (2005). Governor Riley\npromptly exercised that authority by appointing Juan\nChastang.\n   The day after the Alabama Supreme Court denied re\u00ad\nhearing, Kennedy commenced the instant suit in Federal\nDistrict Court. Invoking \u00a75, she sought declaratory relief\nand an injunction barring Governor Riley from filling the\nCommission vacancy by appointment unless and until\nAlabama gained preclearance of the decisions in Stokes\nand Kennedy. As required by \u00a75, a three-judge District\nCourt convened to hear the suit. See 42 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a71973c(a) (Supp. 2007); Allen, 393 U. S., at 563.\n   In August 2006, the three-judge court, after a hearing,\ngranted the requested declaration. The court observed\nfirst that for purposes of \u00a75\u2019s preclearance requirement,\n\u201c[c]hanges are measured by comparing the new challenged\npractice with the baseline practice, that is, the most recent\npractice that is both precleared and in force or effect.\u201d 445\nF. Supp. 2d 1333, 1336 (MD Ala.). It then determined that\nthe 1985 Act\u2019s provision requiring special elections had\nbeen both precleared and put into \u201cforce or effect\u201d with the\nspecial election of Jones in 1987. It followed, the District\nCourt reasoned, that the gubernatorial appointment called\nfor by Stokes and Kennedy ranked as a change from the\nbaseline practice; consequently \u201cthe two [Alabama Su\u00ad\npreme Court] decisions . . . should have been precleared\nbefore they were implemented.\u201d 445 F. Supp. 2d, at 1336.\n   Deferring affirmative relief, the District Court gave the\nState 90 days to obtain preclearance of Stokes and Ken-\nnedy. 445 F. Supp 2d, at 1336. Without conceding that\npreclearance was required, the State submitted the deci\u00ad\nsions to the DOJ. Finding that the State had failed to\nprove that the reinstatement of gubernatorial appoint\u00ad\nment would not be retrogressive, the Department denied\npreclearance. See App. to Motion to Dismiss or Affirm 2a\u2013\n8                        RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n8a. \u201cThe African-American voters of District 1,\u201d the DOJ\nexplained, \u201cenjoy the opportunity to elect minority candi\u00ad\ndates of their choice\u201d under the 1985 Act. Id., at 6a. A\nchange to gubernatorial appointment would be retrogres\u00ad\nsive because it \u201cwould transfer this electoral power to a\nstate official elected by a statewide constituency whose\nracial make-up and electoral choices regularly differ from\nthose of the voters of District 1.\u201d Ibid.\n   After the State unsuccessfully sought DOJ reconsidera\u00ad\ntion, Kennedy returned to the District Court and filed a\nmotion for further relief. On May 1, 2007, the District\nCourt ruled that \u201cGovernor Bob Riley\u2019s appointment of\nJuan Chastang to the Mobile County Commission . . . was\nunlawful under federal law\u201d and vacated the appointment.\nApp. to Juris. Statement 1a\u20132a. Governor Riley filed a\nnotice of appeal in the District Court on May 18, 2007, and\na Jurisdictional Statement in this Court on July 17, 2007.\nIn November 2007, we postponed a determination of juris\u00ad\ndiction until our consideration of the case on the merits.\n552 U. S. ___.\n   In the meantime, a special election was held in Mobile\nCounty in October 2007 to fill the vacancy resulting from\nthe District Court\u2019s order vacating Chastang\u2019s appoint\u00ad\nment.3 Chastang ran in the election but was defeated by\nMerceria Ludgood, who garnered nearly 80% of the vote.\nSee Certification of Results, Special Election, Mobile\nCounty (Oct. 16, 2007), http://records.mobile-county.net/\nViewImagesPDFAll.Aspx?ID=2007081288 (as visited May\n22, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\nLudgood continues to occupy the District One seat on the\nCommission. Her term will expire in November 2008.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The District Court denied the Governor\u2019s motion to stay its judg\u00ad\n\nment pending this appeal. See App. 7.\n  4 Regardless of the outcome of this litigation, the method for filling\n\nfuture midterm vacancies on the Commission appears to have been\nsettled. In 2006, the Alabama Legislature enacted a new measure\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III\n   Before reaching the merits of Governor Riley\u2019s appeal,\nwe first take up Kennedy\u2019s threshold objection. The ap\u00ad\npeal, Kennedy urges, must be dismissed as untimely.\n   Section 5 provides that \u201cany appeal\u201d from the decision of\na three-judge district court \u201cshall lie to the Supreme\nCourt.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973c(a). Such an appeal must be\nfiled within 60 days of the District Court\u2019s entry of a final\njudgment. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72101(b). Kennedy maintains\nthat Governor Riley\u2019s May 18, 2007 notice of appeal came\ntoo late because the District Court\u2019s August 2006 order\nqualified as a final judgment. If Kennedy\u2019s characteriza\u00ad\ntion is correct, then Governor Riley\u2019s time to file an appeal\nexpired in October 2006 and his appeal must be dismissed.\nBut if, as Governor Riley maintains, the District Court did\nnot issue a final judgment until the order vacating Chas\u00ad\ntang\u2019s appointment on May 1, 2007, then the Governor\nfiled his appeal well within the required time.\n   A final judgment is \u201cone which ends the litigation on the\nmerits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute\nthe judgment.\u201d Catlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229, 233\n(1945).5 The District Court\u2019s August 2006 order declared\nthat the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Stokes and\nKennedy required preclearance, but that order left unre\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nproviding that, on a going-forward basis, vacancies on the Commission\nwill be filled by special election. See 2006 Ala. Acts no. 2006\u2013342. The\nDOJ precleared the statute in July 2007. The passage of this law does\nnot render this case moot: If the Governor prevails in his appeal,\nChastang may seek reinstatement to the Commission to serve out the\nremainder of the term ending in November 2008. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 5, n. 1.\n  5 Catlin and the other authorities cited in this Part interpret the\n\nmeaning of \u201cfinal decisions\u201d in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291, the statute governing\nappeals from district courts to the courts of appeals. We find them\ninstructive in interpreting the parallel term \u201cfinal\u201d judgment in\n\u00a72101(b).\n10                    RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsolved Kennedy\u2019s demand for injunctive relief. We have\nlong held that an order resolving liability without address\u00ad\ning a plaintiff\u2019s requests for relief is not final. See Liberty\nMut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U. S. 737, 742\u2013743 (1976). See\nalso 15B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Prac\u00ad\ntice and Procedure \u00a73915.2, p. 271 (2d ed. 1992).\n   Resisting the conclusion these authorities indicate,\nKennedy maintains that the August 2006 order ranked as\na final decision for two reasons. First, she contends, that\norder conclusively settled the key remedial issue, for it\ndirected Governor Riley to seek preclearance of the Ala\u00ad\nbama Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Stokes and Kennedy.\nSee Brief for Appellees 26\u201327. This argument misappre\u00ad\nhends the District Court\u2019s order: Far from requiring the\nGovernor to seek preclearance, the District Court ex\u00ad\npressly allowed for the possibility that he would elect not\nto do so. See 445 F. Supp. 2d, at 1337 (\u201cDefendant Riley is\nto keep the court informed of what action, if any, the State\ndecides to take . . . .\u201d (emphasis added)). Second, Kennedy\nnotes that the District Court directed entry of its August\n2006 order \u201cas a final judgment pursuant to Rule 58 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure,\u201d ibid. See Brief for\nAppellees 27. \u201cThe label used by the District Court,\u201d\nhowever, \u201ccannot control [an] order\u2019s appealability.\u201d Sul-\nlivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 628, n. 7 (1990). See\nalso Wetzel, 424 U. S., at 741\u2013743.\n   Because the District Court did not render its final judg\u00ad\nment until May 1, 2007, Governor Riley\u2019s May 18 notice of\nappeal was timely. We therefore proceed to the merits.\n                            IV\n   Prior to 1985, Alabama filled midterm vacancies on the\nMobile County Commission by gubernatorial appointment.\nThe 1985 Act adopted a different practice\u2014special elec\u00ad\ntions. That new practice was used in one election only,\nheld in 1987. The next year, the Alabama Supreme Court\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermined, in Stokes v. Noonan, that the Act authorizing\nspecial elections was invalid under the State\u2019s Constitu\u00ad\ntion. Properly framed, the issue before us is whether \u00a75\nrequired Alabama to obtain preclearance before reinstat\u00ad\ning the practice of gubernatorial appointment in the wake\nof the decision by its highest court invalidating the spe\u00ad\ncial-election law.6\n   It is undisputed that a \u201cchange\u201d from election to ap\u00ad\npointment is a change \u201cwith respect to voting\u201d and thus\ncovered by \u00a75. See Allen, 393 U. S., at 569\u2013570; Presley v.\nEtowah County Comm\u2019n, 502 U. S. 491, 502\u2013503 (1992).\nWe have also stated that the preclearance requirement\nencompasses \u201cvoting changes mandated by order of a state\ncourt.\u201d Branch v. Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 262 (2003). See\nalso Hathorn v. Lovorn, 457 U. S. 255, 265\u2013266, and n. 16\n(1982). The question is whether, given the circumstances\nhere presented, any \u201cchange\u201d within the meaning of \u00a75\noccurred in this case.\n   In order to determine whether an election practice\nconstitutes a \u201cchange\u201d as that term is defined in our \u00a75\nprecedents, we compare the practice with the covered\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 As framed by the District Court, the issue was whether the Alabama\n\nSupreme Court\u2019s decisions in Stokes v. Noonan and Riley v. Kennedy\nshould have been precleared. See 445 F. Supp. 2d, at 1336. This\nformulation, we conclude, misstates the issue in two technical respects.\nFirst, \u00a75 requires a covered jurisdiction to seek preclearance of any\nchanged \u201cpractice . . . with respect to voting.\u201d 42 U. S. C. A. \u00a71973c(a)\n(Supp. 2007). The \u201cpractice\u201d at issue here is gubernatorial appoint\u00ad\nment. That practice, and not the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion of state law in Stokes and Kennedy, is the proper subject of the \u00a75\ninquiry. Second, as Governor Riley noted, see Brief for Appellant 25, if\nthere was a change requiring preclearance, it came about as a result of\nStokes, not Kennedy. Stokes held that the 1985 Act violated the Ala\u00ad\nbama Constitution, and the State accordingly reinstated the practice of\ngubernatorial appointment with the Governor\u2019s 1988 appointment of\nJones. Kennedy simply determined that the 2004 Act did not resurrect\nthe 1985 Act; that decision itself prompted no change in the State\u2019s\nelection practices.\n12                        RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdiction\u2019s \u201cbaseline.\u201d We have defined the baseline as\nthe most recent practice that was both precleared and \u201cin\nforce or effect\u201d\u2014or, absent any change since the jurisdic\u00ad\ntion\u2019s coverage date, the practice that was \u201cin force or\neffect\u201d on that date. See Young, 520 U. S., at 282\u2013283.\nSee also Presley, 502 U. S., at 495. The question is\n\u201cwhether a State has \u2018enact[ed]\u2019 or is \u2018seek[ing] to adminis\u00ad\nter\u2019 a \u2018practice or procedure\u2019 that is \u2018different\u2019 enough\u201d\nfrom the baseline to qualify as a change. Young, 520 U. S.,\nat 281 (quoting 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973c).7\n   For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the 1985\nAct was never \u201cin force or effect\u201d within the meaning of \u00a75.\nAt all relevant times, therefore, the baseline practice for\nfilling midterm vacancies on the Commission was the pre\u00ad\n1985 practice of gubernatorial appointment. The State\u2019s\nreinstatement of that practice thus did not constitute a\nchange requiring preclearance.\n                             A\n  We have directly addressed the \u00a75 term of art \u201cin force\nor effect\u201d on three prior occasions. As will become clear,\nthese precedents do not control this case because they\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 By its terms, \u00a75 requires preclearance of any election practice that is\n\n\u201cdifferent from that in force or effect on\u201d the relevant coverage date\u2014in\nthis case, November 1, 1964. 42 U. S. C. A. \u00a71973c(a) (Supp. 2007).\nGovernor Riley\u2019s opening brief suggested that this text could be read to\nmean that no preclearance is required if a covered jurisdiction seeks to\nadopt the same practice that was in force or effect on its coverage\ndate\u2014even if, because of intervening changes, that practice is different\nfrom the jurisdiction\u2019s baseline. See Brief for Appellant 26\u201327. In\nresponse, Kennedy and the United States noted that the DOJ, see 28\nCFR \u00a751.12 (2007), and the lower courts to consider the question, see,\ne.g., NAACP, DeKalb Cty. Chapter v. Georgia, 494 F. Supp. 668, 677\n(ND Ga. 1980) (three-judge court), have rejected this interpretation.\nSee Brief for Appellees 47\u201349; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n17\u201318. We need not resolve this dispute because the result in this case\nis the same under either view. But see post, at 2\u20133 (taking the issue\nup, although it is academic here).\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

S. 379 (1971), the ques\u00ad\ntion was what practice had been \u201cin force or effect\u201d in the\ncity of Canton, Mississippi, on that State\u2019s \u00a75 coverage\ndate, November 1, 1964. A 1962 state law required selec\u00ad\ntion of city aldermen by at-large elections rather than by\nward. Canton, however, \u201cignored the mandate [of the\nstatute] in the conduct of the 1965 municipal elections\nand, as in 1961, elected aldermen by wards.\u201d Id., at 394.\nIn the 1969 election, the city sought to switch to at-large\nelections. We held that this move was a change requiring\npreclearance because election by ward was \u201cthe procedure\nin fact \u2018in force or effect\u2019 in Canton on November 1, 1964.\u201d\nId., at 395.\n   We endeavored to determine in Perkins the voting pro\u00ad\ncedure that would have been followed on the coverage\ndate, November 1, 1964. Two choices were apparent: the\nstate law on the books since 1962 calling for at-large\nelections, or the practice Canton actually used, without\nchallenge, in 1965\u2014election by wards. We picked the 1965\npractice as the more likely indicator of the practice Canton\nwould have employed had it held an election on the cover\u00ad\nage date, just seven months earlier. See id., at 394\u2013395.\n   Similarly, in City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S.\n125 (1983), the question was what practice had been \u201cin\nforce or effect\u201d in Lockhart, Texas, on the relevant \u00a75\ncoverage date, November 1, 1972. For more than 50 years,\nwithout challenge, the city had used a \u201cnumbered-post\u201d\nsystem to elect its city council. See id., at 132, n. 6.8 A\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Under the \u201cnumbered post\u201d system, \u201cthe two commissioner posts\n\nwere designated by number, and each candidate for commissioner\nspecified the post for which he or she sought election.\u201d City of Lockhart\nv. United States, 460 U. S. 125, 127 (1983) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). It contrasted with an alternative system \u201cin which all of the\ncandidates . . . run in a single election, and the two receiving the\n14                     RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ngroup of plaintiffs nonetheless contended that the num\u00ad\nbered-post system was never \u201cin force or effect\u201d because it\nlacked state-law authorization. We noted that the validity\nof the numbered-post system under state law was \u201cnot\nentirely clear.\u201d Id., at 132.9 Relying on Perkins, we con\u00ad\nsidered the uncertain state of Texas law \u201cirrelevant,\u201d for\n\u201c[t]he proper comparison [wa]s between the new system\nand the system actually in effect on November 1, 1972,\nregardless of what state law might have required.\u201d 460\nU. S., at 132 (footnote omitted).\n   Finally, in Young v. Fordice, decided in 1997, the ques\u00ad\ntion was whether a provisional voter registration plan\nimplemented by Mississippi election officials had been \u201cin\nforce or effect.\u201d Believing that the state legislature was\nabout to amend the relevant law, the officials had pre\u00ad\npared and obtained preclearance for a new voter registra\u00ad\ntion scheme. See 520 U. S., at 279. Roughly one-third of\nthe State\u2019s election officials implemented the plan, regis\u00ad\ntering around 4,000 voters. See id., at 278, 283. As it\nturned out, however, the state legislature failed to pass\nthe amendment, and the voters who had registered under\nthe provisional plan were required to reregister. See id.,\nat 278. When the case reached us, we rejected the argu\u00ad\nment that \u201cthe [p]rovisional [p]lan, because it was pre-\ncleared by the Attorney General, became part of the base\u00ad\nline against which to judge whether a future change must\nbe precleared.\u201d Id., at 282. Regarding the provisional\nplan as a \u201ctemporary misapplication of state law,\u201d we held\nthat, for \u00a75 purposes, the plan was \u201cnever \u2018in force or\neffect.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. We emphasized that the officials who im\u00ad\nplemented the provisional plan \u201cdid not intend to adminis\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ngreatest number of votes are elected.\u201d Id., at 127, n. 1.\n  9 We commented in this regard that the longevity of the numbered-\n\npost system \u201csuggest[ed] a presumption of legality under state law.\u201d\nId., at 132, n. 6.\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nter an unlawful plan\u201d and that they abandoned it \u201cas soon\nas its unlawfulness became apparent.\u201d Id., at 283. We\nalso noted that the provisional plan had been used for only\n41 days and that the State \u201cheld no elections\u201d during that\nperiod. Ibid.\n                               B\n   Perkins and Lockhart established that an election prac\u00ad\ntice may be \u201cin force or effect\u201d for \u00a75 purposes despite its\nillegality under state law if, as a practical matter, it was\n\u201cactually in effect.\u201d Lockhart, 460 U. S., at 132. Our more\nrecent decision in Young, however, qualified that general\nrule: A practice best characterized as nothing more than a\n\u201ctemporary misapplication of state law,\u201d we held, is not in\n\u201cforce or effect,\u201d even if actually implemented by state\nelection officials. 520 U. S., at 282.\n   If the only relevant factors were the length of time a\npractice was in use and the extent to which it was imple\u00ad\nmented, this would be a close case falling somewhere\nbetween the two poles established by our prior decisions.\nOn one hand, as in Young, the 1985 Act was a \u201ctemporary\nmisapplication\u201d of state law: It was on the books for just\nover three years and applied as a voting practice only\nonce. In Lockhart, by contrast, the city had used the\nnumbered-post system \u201cfor over 50 years without chal\u00ad\nlenge.\u201d 460 U. S., at 132, n. 6. (Perkins is a less clear\ncase: The city failed to alter its practice in response to\nchanged state law for roughly seven years, but only a\nsingle election was held during that period. See 400 U. S.,\nat 394.) On the other hand, in Young no election occurred\nduring the time the provisional registration plan was in\nuse, while in this case one election was held under the\nlater-invalidated 1985 Act.\n   We are convinced, however, that an extraordinary cir\u00ad\ncumstance not present in any past case is operative here,\nimpelling the conclusion that the 1985 Act was never \u201cin\n16                       RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nforce or effect\u201d: The Act was challenged in state court at\nfirst opportunity, the lone election was held in the shadow\nof that legal challenge, and the Act was ultimately invali\u00ad\ndated by the Alabama Supreme Court.\n   These characteristics plainly distinguish the present\ncase from Perkins and Lockhart. The state judiciary had\nno involvement in either of those cases, as the practices at\nissue were administered without legal challenge of any\nkind. And in Lockhart, we justified our unwillingness to\nincorporate a practice\u2019s legality under state law into the \u00a75\n\u201cforce or effect\u201d inquiry in part on this ground: \u201cWe\ndoubt[ed] that Congress intended\u201d to require \u201cthe Attorney\nGeneral and the District Court for the District of Colum\u00ad\nbia\u201d to engage in \u201cspeculation as to state law.\u201d 460 U. S.,\nat 133, n. 8. Here, in contrast, the 1985 Act\u2019s invalidity\nunder the Alabama Constitution has been definitively\nestablished by the Alabama Supreme Court.\n   The prompt legal challenge and the Alabama Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision not only distinguish this case from Per-\nkins and Lockhart; they also provide strong cause to con\u00ad\nclude that, in the context of \u00a75, the 1985 Act was never \u201cin\nforce or effect.\u201d A State\u2019s highest court is unquestionably\n\u201cthe ultimate exposito[r] of state law.\u201d Mullaney v.\nWilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 691 (1975). And because the pre\u00ad\nrogative of the Alabama Supreme Court to say what Ala\u00ad\nbama law is merits respect in federal forums,10 a law\nchallenged at first opportunity and invalidated by Ala\u00ad\nbama\u2019s highest court is properly regarded as null and void\nab initio, incapable of effecting any change in Alabama\nlaw or establishing a voting practice for \u00a75 purposes.\nIndeed, Kennedy and the United States appear to concede\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The dissent observes that the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\n\nStokes was not unanimous. See post, at 8\u20139. Like this Court, the\nAlabama Supreme Court does not shy away from revealing dissenting\nopinions. Of course, it is the majority opinion that declares what state\nlaw is.\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the 1985 Act would not have been \u201cin force or effect\u201d\nhad the Alabama Supreme Court stayed the 1987 election\npending its decision in Stokes (or simply issued its decision\nsooner). See Brief for Appellees 51; Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 23\u201324.\n  There is no good reason to hold otherwise simply be\u00ad\ncause Alabama\u2019s highest court, proceeding at a pace\nhardly uncommon in litigated controversies, did not ren\u00ad\nder its decision until after an election was held. In this\nregard, we have recognized that practical considerations\nsometimes require courts to allow elections to proceed\ndespite pending legal challenges. Cf. Purcell v. Gonzalez,\n549 U. S. 1, 5\u20136 (2006) (per curiam) (\u201cGiven the immi\u00ad\nnence of the election and the inadequate time to resolve\nthe factual disputes, our action today shall of necessity\nallow the election to proceed without an injunction sus\u00ad\npending the [challenged] rules.\u201d).\n  Ruling as Kennedy and the United States urge, more\u00ad\nover, would have the anomalous effect of binding Alabama\nto an unconstitutional practice because of a state trial\ncourt\u2019s error. If the trial court had gotten the law of Ala\u00ad\nbama right, all agree, there would have been no special\nelection and no tenable argument that the 1985 Act had\never gained \u201cforce or effect.\u201d But the trial court miscon\u00ad\nstrued the State\u2019s law and, due to that court\u2019s error, an\nelection took place. That sequence of events, the District\nCourt held, made the Act part of Alabama\u2019s \u00a75 baseline.\nNo precedent of this Court calls for such a holding.\n  The District Court took care to note that its decision\n\u201cd[id] not in any way undermine [Stokes and Kennedy]\nunder state law.\u201d 445 F. Supp. 2d, at 1337. In some theo\u00ad\nretical sense, that may be true. Practically, however, the\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision gave controlling effect to the\nerroneous trial court decision and rendered the Alabama\nSupreme Court\u2019s corrections inoperative.          Alabama\u2019s\nConstitution, that State\u2019s Supreme Court determined,\n18                       RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired that, in the years here involved, vacancies on the\nMobile County Commission be filled by appointment\nrather than special election. Nothing inherent in the\npractice of appointment violates the Fifteenth Amendment\nor the VRA. The DOJ, however, found that a change from\nspecial elections to appointment had occurred in District\nOne, and further found that the change was retrogressive,\nhence barred by \u00a75. The District Court\u2019s final decision,\ntied to the DOJ determination, thus effectively precluded\nthe State from reinstating gubernatorial appointment, the\nonly practice consistent with the Alabama Constitution\npre-2006.11 Indeed, Kennedy\u2019s counsel forthrightly ac\u00ad\nknowledged that the position she defends would \u201cloc[k]\ninto place\u201d an unconstitutional practice. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n32.\n   The dissent, too, appears to concede that its reading of\n\u00a75 would bind Alabama to an unconstitutional practice\nbecause of an error by the state trial court. See post, at 7.\nBut it contends that this imposition is no more \u201coffensive\nto state sovereignty\u201d than \u201ceffectively requiring a State to\nadminister a law it has repealed,\u201d post, at 8\u2014a routine\nconsequence of \u00a75. The result described by the dissent,\nhowever, follows directly from the Constitution\u2019s instruc\u00ad\ntion that a state law may not be enforced if it conflicts\nwith federal law. See Art. VI, cl. 2. Section 5 prohibits\nStates from making retrogressive changes to their voting\npractices, and thus renders any such changes unenforce\u00ad\nable. To be sure, this result constrains States\u2019 legislative\nfreedom. But the rule advocated by the dissent would\neffectively preclude Alabama\u2019s highest court from applying\nto a state law a provision of the State Constitution entirely\nharmonious with federal law. That sort of interference\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 As earlier noted, see supra, at 8\u20139, n. 4, the Alabama Legislature\n\nmodified the relevant state law in 2006 by adopting special elections on\na going-forward basis.\n                   Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                19\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwith a state supreme court\u2019s ability to determine the\ncontent of state law, we think it plain, is a burden of a\ndifferent order.\n   This burden is more than a hypothetical concern. The\nrealities of election litigation are such that lower state\ncourts often allow elections to proceed based on erroneous\ninterpretations of state law later corrected on appeal. See,\ne.g., Akins v. Secretary of State, 154 N. H. 67, 67\u201368, 74,\n904 A. 2d 702, 703, 708 (2006) (preelection challenge\nrejected by a state trial court but eventually sustained in a\npostelection decision by the State Supreme Court); Cobb v.\nState Canvassing Bd., 2006\u2013NMSC\u2013034, \u00b6\u00b61\u201317, 140\nN.

We\ndecline to adopt a rigid interpretation of \u201cin force or effect\u201d\nthat would deny state supreme courts the opportunity to\ncorrect similar errors in the future.\n                              C\n  Although our reasoning and the particular facts of this\ncase should make the narrow scope of our holding appar\u00ad\nent, we conclude with some cautionary observations.\nFirst, the presence of a judgment by Alabama\u2019s highest\ncourt declaring the 1985 Act invalid under the State Con\u00ad\nstitution is critical to our decision.12 We do not suggest\nthe outcome would be the same if a potentially unlawful\npractice had simply been abandoned by state officials after\ninitial use in an election. Cf. Perkins, 400 U. S., at 395.\nSecond, the 1985 Act was challenged the first time it was\ninvoked and struck down shortly thereafter. The same\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 There is no indication in the record that the Alabama Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s decisions in Stokes and Kennedy were anything other than\nreasonable and impartial interpretations of controlling Alabama law.\n20                       RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nresult would not necessarily follow if a practice were in\u00ad\nvalidated only after enforcement without challenge in\nseveral previous elections. Cf. Young, 520 U. S., at 283\n(\u201c[T]he simple fact that a voting practice is unlawful under\nstate law does not show, entirely by itself, that the prac\u00ad\ntice was never \u2018in force or effect.\u2019 . . . A State, after all,\nmight maintain in effect for many years a plan that tech\u00ad\nnically . . . violated some provision of state law.\u201d). Finally,\nthe consequence of the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s decision\nin Stokes was to reinstate a practice\u2014gubernatorial ap\u00ad\npointment\u2014identical to the State\u2019s \u00a75 baseline. Preclear\u00ad\nance might well have been required had the court instead\nordered the State to adopt a novel practice.13\n                        *     *   *\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United\nStates District Court for the Middle District of Alabama is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 In view of these limitations, the concern expressed in Part IV of the\n\ndissent, see post, at 9\u201313, is misplaced. The Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s\nhistorical role in administering the State\u2019s discriminatory literacy test,\nthe dissent contends, \u201cindicates that state courts must be treated on the\nsame terms as state legislatures for \u00a75 purposes,\u201d post, at 9. But it is\ncommon ground that a \u201cchange\u201d made pursuant to a state-court order is\nsubject to \u00a75 scrutiny; the only question is whether the Alabama\nSupreme Court\u2019s ruling in Stokes triggered a \u201cchange\u201d within the\nmeaning of our decisions. See supra, at 11; post, at 8. More impor\u00ad\ntantly, none of the past discriminatory actions by the state court\nidentified in the dissent would have been sheltered from \u00a75 review by\nour tightly bounded decision in this case.\n                   Cite as: 553 U.

The principal\nevents at issue in this case occurred in the 1980\u2019s, when\nthe State\u2019s transition from a blatantly discriminatory\nregime was well underway.\n  Nevertheless, since Congress recently decided to renew\nthe VRA,1 and our task is to interpret that statute, we\nmust give the VRA the same generous interpretation that\nour cases have consistently endorsed throughout its his-\ntory. In my judgment, the Court\u2019s decision today is not\nfaithful to those cases or to Congress\u2019 intent to give \u00a75 of\nthe VRA, \u00a71973c (2000 ed.), the \u201cbroadest possible scope,\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting\nRights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, 120 Stat.\n577.

Reflecting the fact that Con-\ngress certainly did not intend \u00a75 to create a \u201csafe harbor\u201d\nfor voting practices identical to practices in effect in 1964,\nthe settled understanding among lower courts and the\nDepartment of Justice is that \u00a75 operates instead as a\nratchet, freezing in place the most recent voting practice.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16\u201318 (col-\nlecting cases); 28 CFR \u00a751.12 (2007). Furthermore, Con-\ngress has reauthorized the VRA in the face of this under-\nstanding without amending the relevant language of \u00a75.\nSee Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments\nAct of 2006, 120 Stat. 577; ante, at 3, n. 1 (describing the\nhistory of renewals and extensions of the VRA). Thus, the\ninclusion of the date 1964 in the language of \u00a75 poses no\nobstacle to my conclusion that Stokes\u2014even though it\nreturned to gubernatorial practice\u2014implemented a change\nin voting practice that required preclearance.\n                             II\n   Whether a voting practice represents a change that\nrequires preclearance is measured against the previously\nprecleared \u201cbaseline\u201d practice in force or effect.

S. 379 (1971),\nfor example, we held that the baseline practice was not at-\nlarge elections, even though at-large elections were re-\nquired by a 1962 state statute. Because the city had never\nimplemented that statute, we held that the practice actu-\nally in force or effect on November 1, 1964 was ward elec-\ntions, despite that practice\u2019s illegality under state law.\nId., at 394\u2013395.\n   The situation was similar in City of Lockhart v. United\nStates, 460 U. S. 125 (1983). There we considered whether\nthe practice of using numbered posts for elections was in\nforce on the relevant coverage date and concluded that\ndespite the possibility that this practice was illegal under\nTexas law, the numbered-post system could serve as the\nbaseline. Id., at 132, and n. 6. We emphasized once again\nthat \u201c[s]ection 5 was intended to halt actual retrogression\nin minority voting strength without regard for the legality\nunder state law of the practices already in effect.\u201d Id., at\n133.\n   In Young v. Fordice, 520 U. S. 273 (1997), our most\nrecent case deciding whether a voting practice was a\nbaseline under \u00a75, we concluded that the registration\nprocedure at issue was not \u201cin force or effect\u201d and there-\nfore could not serve as the \u00a75 baseline. In 1994, Missis-\nsippi began modifying its registration practices in an\nattempt to comply with the National Voter Registration\nAct of 1993, 107 Stat. 77, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973gg et seq. (2000\ned. and Supp. V). In late 1994, the Mississippi Secretary\nof State proposed a series of changes and assumed that\nthe Mississippi Legislature would adopt those changes.\nThe Secretary of State told at least one election official to\nbegin registering voters under the new plan. The pro-\nposed changes were precleared, and about 4,000 voters\nwere registered. The legislature failed to adopt the pro-\nposal, however, and the registrants were notified that they\nwere not, as they had thought, registered to vote in state\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

We held\nthat the provisional registration system was not the base-\nline because it was never in force or effect.\n   An ordinary observer asked to describe voting practice\nin Alabama with respect to the method of filling vacancies\non the Mobile County Commission would no doubt state\nthat before 1985 the practice was gubernatorial appoint-\nment, between 1985 and 1988 the practice was special\nelection, and beginning in 1988 the practice changed to\ngubernatorial appointment.\n   In the face of this history, the Court comes to the star-\ntling conclusion that for purposes of the VRA Alabama has\nnever ceased to practice gubernatorial appointment as its\nmethod of selecting members of the Mobile County Com-\nmission. But under our case law interpreting \u00a75, it is clear\nthat a change occurred in 1988 when Stokes returned\nAlabama to gubernatorial appointment.2 This represented\na change because the relevant baseline was the special\nelection procedure mandated by the Alabama Legislature\u2019s\nenactment of the 1985 Act, which was precleared by the\nDepartment of Justice in June 1985. Pursuant to that\nlaw, the Governor called a special election when a vacancy\narose in 1987. The vacancy was filled and the newly\nelected commissioner took office in July 1987 serving, by\nway of his election, until September 1988.\n   It is difficult to say that the special election practice was\nnever \u201cin force or effect\u201d with a straight face. Jones was\nelected and sat on the three-member Mobile County\nCommission for approximately 14 months. During those\n14 months, the County Commission held dozens of meet-\nings, at which the Commission exercised its executive and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Even the majority cannot escape this conclusion, stating that \u201c[t]he\n\nState\u2019s reinstatement of th[e] practice [of gubernatorial appointment]\ndid not constitute a change requiring preclearance.\u201d Ante, at 12 (em-\nphasis added); see also, e.g., ante, at 7, 12. Of course, if there was no\nchange, then there was nothing to reinstate.\n6                    RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nadministrative functions. During the time he served as a\nresult of the special election, Jones was central to actions\nhaving a direct and immediate impact on Mobile County.\nFor example, at a meeting held on October 13, 1987, the\nCommission considered 25 agenda items, one of which was\npaying claims and payrolls of over $1 million. Minutes\nfrom Meeting Oct. 13, 1987.\n   The differences between this case and Fordice are le-\ngion. In holding that the provisional registration system\nin Fordice did not constitute the baseline by which to\nmeasure future practices, we emphasized that the plan\nwas abandoned as soon as it was clear that it would not be\nenacted, the plan was in use for only 41 days, and only\nabout one-third of the election officials had even imple-\nmented the proposal. 520 U. S., at 283. Further, the\nState rectified the situation far in advance of any elec-\ntions; there was no evidence that anyone was prevented\nfrom voting because of reliance on the rejected plan. Ibid.\n   Fordice was in essence a case of \u201cno harm, no foul.\u201d\nHere, of course, the special election did take place and the\nelected commissioner held his post for 14 months, voting\non hundreds of measures shaping the governance of Mo-\nbile County. While the voters in Fordice could be reregis-\ntered under the new procedures, Jones\u2019 election to the\nCommission and his 14-month service cannot be undone.\n   The majority seems to acknowledge that Fordice is\ndistinguishable, stating that if \u201cthe only relevant factors\nwere the length of time a practice was in use and the\nextent to which it was implemented, this would be a close\ncase.\u201d Ante, at 15. The Court relies, however, on the\n\u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d that the 1985 Act was chal-\nlenged immediately and that the 1987 election was held\n\u201cin the shadow\u201d of that legal challenge. Ante, at 15\u201316.\nBut a cloud of litigation cannot undermine the obvious\nconclusion that the special election practice was in force or\neffect. That practice, therefore, is the practice to which\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)              7\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ngubernatorial appointment must be compared.\n  The majority makes much of the fact that to adopt the\nview of the three-judge District Court would make the\nquestion whether a voting practice is \u201cin force or effect\u201d\nturn on whether the circuit court happened to get the law\nright in time to stop the election. Ante, at 17. But the\nmajority\u2019s approach turns instead on whether Alabama\npossesses highly motivated private litigants. If Stokes had\nnot challenged the election until it had already taken\nplace (or had failed to appeal), the election would be in\nforce or effect under the majority\u2019s view. Nothing in the\nVRA or our cases suggests that the VRA\u2019s application\nshould hinge on how quickly private litigants challenge\nvoting laws.\n  Our decisions in Perkins and Lockhart give no indication\nthat if a citizen in Canton, Mississippi or Lockhart, Texas\nhad challenged the legality of the ward elections or the\nnumbered-post system, the illegality of those practices\nunder state law would have been any more relevant to\ntheir status as the relevant baselines. This case calls for\nnothing more than a straightforward application of our\nprecedent; that precedent makes clear that the special\nelection procedure was the relevant baseline and that\ngubernatorial appointment therefore represents a change\nthat must be precleared.\n                              III\n   The VRA makes no distinction among the paths that can\nlead to a change in voting practice, requiring preclearance\n\u201cwhenever\u201d a State seeks to enact \u201cany\u201d change in voting\npractice. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973c. And changes to voting prac-\ntice can arise in at least four ways: (1) legislative enact-\nment; (2) executive action; (3) judicial changes, either by a\nproactive judicial decision (e.g., redistricting) or, as in this\ncase, through judicial interpretation of state law; or (4)\ninformal abandonment or adoption by election officials.\n8                     RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n  The majority does not dispute that a change in voting\npractice wrought by a state court can be subject to pre-\nclearance. See ante, at 11 (citing Branch v. Smith, 538\nU. S. 254 (2003), and Hathorn v. Lovorn, 457 U. S. 255\n(1982)). But the majority falters when it treats the change\neffected by Stokes differently for \u00a75 preclearance purposes\nthan it would treat a newly enacted statute or executive\nregulation. The majority finds it \u201canomalous\u201d that Ala-\nbama might be bound \u201cto an unconstitutional practice\nbecause of a state trial court\u2019s error.\u201d Ante, at 17. The\nclear theme running through the majority\u2019s analysis is\nthat the Alabama Supreme Court is more deserving of\ncomity than the Alabama Legislature.\n  Imagine that the 1985 Act had been held constitutional\nby the Alabama Supreme Court in Stokes, but that in 1988\nthe Alabama Legislature changed its mind and repealed\nthe Act, enacting in its place a statute providing for gu-\nbernatorial appointment. Imagine further that the De-\npartment of Justice refused to preclear the practice (as it\nno doubt would); if Alabama wanted to fill an open seat on\nthe Mobile County Commission it would have to adminis-\nter its former special election practice even though that\nlaw had been repealed. It is not clear to me or to the\nUnited States, see Brief as Amicus Curiae 25\u201327, why\neffectively requiring a State to administer a law it has\nrepealed is less offensive to state sovereignty than requir-\ning a State to administer a law its highest court has found\nunconstitutional. The VRA \u201cby its nature, intrudes on\nstate sovereignty.\u201d Lopez v. Monterey County, 525 U. S.\n266, 284 (1999).\n  The majority attempts to portray the circuit court\njudge\u2019s decision as so far outside the bounds of Alabama\nlaw, see ante, at 17, that allowing it to effectively establish\nthe special election practice as a \u00a75 baseline would be\nintolerable. I am certain, however, that the two Alabama\nSupreme Court Justices dissenting in Stokes would dis-\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

The dissenting Justices argued that the 1985\nAct was sufficiently \u201camendatory\u201d to avoid the require-\nments of Peddycoart v. Birmingham, 354 So. 2d 808 (Ala.\n1978), because it merely amended the 1957 Act creating\nthe Mobile County Commission. The Circuit Court Judge\nfollowed similar reasoning, citing Alabama Supreme Court\nprecedent stating that \u201c[i]t is the duty of the courts to\nsustain the constitutionality of a legislative act unless it is\nclear beyond a reasonable doubt that it is in violation of\nthe fundamental law.\u201d Stokes v. Noonan, CV\u201387\u2013001316\n(Mobile County, May 19, 1987). Nothing in the circuit\ncourt judge\u2019s decision indicates that this case calls for\nanything other than a straightforward application of our\nprecedent.\n                             IV\n  Finally, the history of the voting practices that the VRA\nsought to address, especially in Alabama itself, indicates\nthat state courts must be treated on the same terms as\nstate legislatures for \u00a75 purposes. Specifically, the history\nof Alabama\u2019s voter registration requirements makes this\nquite clear.3 Alabama\u2019s literacy test originated in a consti-\ntutional convention called in 1901 \u201clargely, if not princi-\npally, for the purpose of changing the 1875 Constitution so\nas to eliminate Negro voters.\u201d United States v.

The effects of the new Constitution were\nstaggering: In 1900, 100,000 African-Americans were\nenrolled as voters in Alabama. By 1908, only 3,742 Afri-\ncan-Americans were registered to vote. Alabama, 252\nF. Supp., at 99; V. Hamilton, Alabama: A Bicentennial\nHistory 96 (1977).5\n   The Alabama Constitution provided for judicial review\nof contested registrar decisions, see \u00a7186 (1901), but that\nreview provision was rendered all but useless by the Ala-\nbama Supreme Court\u2019s adoption of both a strong presump-\ntion that the Board of Registrars\u2019 decisions were valid and\nstringent pleading requirements. For example, in Haw-\nkins v. Vines, 249 Ala. 165, 30 So. 2d 451 (1947), the Ala-\nbama Supreme Court rejected a petition from a denial of\nregistration because the petitioner averred that he \u201cis a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nit, to vote again. We want to see that old condition restored. Upon that\ntheory we took the stump in Alabama, having pledged ourselves to the\nwhite people of Alabama, upon the platform that we would not disfran-\nchise a single white man, if you trust us to frame an organic law for\nAlabama, but it is our purpose, it is our intention, and here is our\nregistered vow to disfranchise every negro in the State and not a single\nwhite man.\u201d 3 Official Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of\nthe State of Alabama, May 21st, 1901, To September 3rd 1901, p. 2844\n(1941).\n   5 Provisions following the lead of the 1890 \u201cMississippi Plan\u201d were\n\nenacted in other State Constitutions, with similar results. See C.\nZelden, The Battle for the Black Ballot 17\u201318 (2004) (describing similar\nchanges to registration practice in Mississippi, South Carolina, North\nCarolina, Louisiana, Alabama, Virginia, Texas, and Georgia and their\neffects on registration); C. Woodward, Origins of the New South 1877\u2013\n1913, pp. 321\u2013349 (1951) (describing effect of Mississippi Plan on the\nStates that adopted it). While poor white voters were also disfran-\nchised to a significant degree, these provisions fell most heavily on\nAfrican-American voters. See id., at 342\u2013343 (demonstrating that\nbetween 1897 and 1900 in Louisiana registered white voters dropped by\nabout 40,000 and registered African-Americans dropped by approxi-\nmately 125,000).\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

Not easily deterred, the legisla-\nture responded with a new amendment, ratified in De-\ncember 1951, which provided that the Alabama Supreme\nCourt would promulgate a uniform questionnaire to be\ncompleted by all applicants.

In 1960, in response to the efforts of African-\nAmerican organizations to educate voters, the questions\nwere arranged in different sequences for different ques-\ntionnaires. B. Landsberg, Free at Last to Vote: The Ala-\nbama Origins of the 1965 Voting Rights Act 19 (2007).\nThese new questionnaires had the effect of blocking the\nregistration of thousands of African-American voters.

As of its November 1, 1964 cov-\n  erage date, state law provided that midterm vacancies on county\n  commissions were to be filled by gubernatorial appointment. In\n  1985, the state legislature passed, and the DOJ precleared, a \u201clocal\n  law\u201d providing that Mobile County Commission midterm vacancies\n  would be filled by special election rather than gubernatorial ap-\n  pointment. In 1987, the Governor called a special election for the\n  first midterm opening on the Commission postpassage of the 1985\n  Act. A Mobile County voter, Willie Stokes, filed suit in state court\n  seeking to enjoin the election, but the state trial court denied his re-\n  quest. Although Stokes immediately appealed to the Alabama Su-\n  preme Court, the special election went forward and the winner took\n  office. Subsequently, however, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed\n  the trial court\u2019s judgment, finding that the 1985 Act violated the\n  State Constitution.\n     When the next midterm Commission vacancy occurred in 2005, the\n  method of filling the opening again became the subject of litigation.\n  In 2004, the state legislature had passed, and the DOJ had pre-\n  cleared, a law providing for gubernatorial appointment as the means\n  to fill county commission vacancies unless a local law authorized a\n  special election. When the vacancy arose, appellee voters and state\n  legislators (hereinafter Kennedy) filed suit against the Governor in\n  state court, asserting that the 2004 Act had revived the 1985 Act and\n2                           RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cured its infirmity under the Alabama Constitution. Adopting Ken-\n    nedy\u2019s view, the trial court ordered the Governor to call a special elec-\n    tion. Before the election took place, however, the Alabama Supreme\n    Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order, holding that the 2004 Act did\n    not resurrect the 1985 Act. The Governor therefore filled the vacancy\n    by appointment, naming Commissioner Chastang to the open seat.\n    Kennedy then commenced this suit in Federal District Court. Invok-\n    ing \u00a75 of the VRA, she sought declaratory relief and an injunction\n    barring the Governor from filling the Commission vacancy by ap-\n    pointment unless and until Alabama gained preclearance of the\n    Stokes and Kennedy decisions. A three-judge District Court granted\n    the requested declaration in August 2006. It determined that the\n    \u201cbaseline\u201d against which any change should be measured was the\n    1985 Act\u2019s provision requiring special elections, a measure both pre-\n    cleared and put into \u201cforce or effect\u201d with the special election in 1987.\n    It followed, the District Court reasoned, that the gubernatorial ap-\n    pointment called for by Stokes and Kennedy ranked as a change from\n    the baseline practice; consequently, those decisions should have been\n    precleared. Deferring affirmative relief, the District Court gave the\n    State 90 days to obtain preclearance. When the DOJ denied the\n    State\u2019s request for preclearance, Kennedy returned to the District\n    Court and filed a motion for further relief. On May 1, 2007, the Dis-\n    trict Court vacated the Governor\u2019s appointment of Chastang to the\n    Commission, finding it unlawful under \u00a75 of the VRA. The Governor\n    filed a notice of appeal in the District Court on May 18.\nHeld:\n    1. Because the District Court did not render its final judgment un-\n til May 1, 2007, the Governor\u2019s May 18 notice of appeal was timely.\n Under \u00a75, \u201cany appeal\u201d from the decision of a three-judge district\n court \u201cshall lie to the Supreme Court,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973c(a), but the\n appeal must be filed within 60 days of a district court\u2019s entry of a fi-\n nal judgment, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a72101(b). Kennedy maintains that the\n District Court\u2019s August 2006 order qualified as a final judgment,\n while the Governor maintains that the District Court\u2019s final judg-\n ment was the May 1 order vacating Chastang\u2019s appointment. A final\n judgment \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for\n the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d Catlin v. United States,\n 324 U. S. 229, 233. The August 2006 order declared that preclear-\n ance was required for the Stokes and Kennedy decisions, but left un-\n resolved Kennedy\u2019s demand for injunctive relief. An order resolving\n liability without addressing a plaintiff\u2019s requests for relief is not fi-\n nal. See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U. S. 737, 742\u2013743.\n Pp. 9\u201310.\n    2. For \u00a75 purposes, the 1985 Act never gained \u201cforce or effect.\u201d\n                   Cite as: 553 U.

See Young v. Fordice, 520 U. S. 273,\n282\u2013283. Pp. 10\u201312.\n   (b) While not controlling here, three precedents addressing \u00a75\u2019s\nterm of art \u201cin force or effect\u201d provide the starting point for the\nCourt\u2019s inquiry. In Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379, the question\nwas what practice had been \u201cin force or effect\u201d in Canton, Mississippi,\non that State\u2019s 1964 coverage date. A 1962 state law required at-\nlarge elections for city aldermen, but Canton had elected aldermen by\nwards in 1961 and again in 1965. This Court held that the city\u2019s\n1969 attempt to move to at-large elections was a change requiring\npreclearance because election by ward was \u201cthe procedure in fact \u2018in\nforce or effect\u2019 in Canton\u201d on the coverage date. Id., at 395. Simi-\nlarly, in City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S. 125, the question\nwas what practice had been \u201cin force or effect\u201d in Lockhart, Texas, on\nthe relevant coverage date. The city had used a \u201cnumbered-post\u201d sys-\ntem to elect its city council for more than 50 years. Though the num-\nbered-post system\u2019s validity under state law was \u201cnot entirely clear,\u201d\nid., at 132, \u201c[t]he proper comparison [wa]s between the new system\nand the system actually in effect on\u201d the coverage date, \u201cregardless of\nwhat state law might have required,\u201d ibid. Finally, in Young v. Ford-\nice, the question was whether a provisional voter registration plan\nprecleared and implemented by Mississippi election officials, who be-\nlieved that the state legislature was about to amend the relevant law,\nhad been \u201cin force or effect.\u201d See 520 U. S., at 279. As it turned out,\nthe state legislature failed to pass the amendment, and voters who\nhad registered under the provisional plan were required to reregister.\nThis Court held that the provisional plan was a \u201ctemporary misappli-\ncation of state law\u201d that, for \u00a75 purposes, was \u201cnever \u2018in force or ef-\nfect.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 282. Young thus qualified the general rule of Perkins\nand Lockhart: A practice best characterized as nothing more than a\n\u201ctemporary misapplication of state law,\u201d is not in \u201cforce or effect,\u201d\neven if actually implemented by state election officials, 520 U. S., at\n282. Pp. 12\u201315.\n     (c) If the only relevant factors were the length of time a practice\nwas in use and the degree to which it was implemented, this would\nbe a close case under Perkins, Lockhart, and Young. But an extraor-\n4                          RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    dinary circumstance not present in any past case is operative here,\n    impelling the conclusion that the 1985 Act was never \u201cin force or ef-\n    fect\u201d: The Act was challenged in state court at first opportunity, the\n    lone election was held in the shadow of that legal challenge, and the\n    Act was ultimately invalidated by the Alabama Supreme Court.\n    These characteristics plainly distinguish this case from Perkins and\n    Lockhart, where the state judiciary had no involvement. The prompt\n    legal challenge and the State Supreme Court\u2019s decision also provide\n    strong cause to conclude that, in the \u00a75 context, the 1985 Act was\n    never \u201cin force or effect.\u201d A State\u2019s highest court is unquestionably\n    \u201cthe ultimate exposito[r] of state law.\u201d Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S.\n    684, 691. And because the State Supreme Court\u2019s prerogative to say\n    what Alabama law is merits respect in federal forums, a law chal-\n    lenged at first opportunity and invalidated by Alabama\u2019s highest\n    court is properly regarded as null and void ab initio, incapable of ef-\n    fecting any change in Alabama law or establishing a voting practice\n    under \u00a75. There is no good reason to hold otherwise simply because\n    Alabama\u2019s highest court did not render its decision until after an\n    election was held. To the contrary, practical considerations some-\n    times require courts to allow elections to proceed despite pending le-\n    gal challenges. Cf. Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 5\u20136 (per curiam).\n    Ruling otherwise would have the anomalous effect of binding Ala-\n    bama to an unconstitutional practice because of the state trial court\u2019s\n    error. The trial court misconstrued the State\u2019s law and, due to that\n    court\u2019s error, an election took place. That sequence of events, the\n    District Court held, made the 1985 Act part of Alabama\u2019s \u00a75 baseline.\n    In essence, the District Court\u2019s decision gave controlling effect to the\n    erroneous trial court ruling and rendered the Alabama Supreme\n    Court\u2019s corrections inoperative. That sort of interference with a state\n    supreme court\u2019s ability to determine the content of state law is more\n    than a hypothetical concern. The realities of election litigation are\n    such that lower state courts often allow elections to proceed based on\n    erroneous interpretations of state law later corrected on appeal. The\n    Court declines to adopt a rigid interpretation of \u201cin force or effect\u201d\n    that would deny state supreme courts the opportunity to correct simi-\n    lar errors in the future. Pp. 15\u201319.\n         (d) Although this Court\u2019s reasoning and the facts of this case\n    should make the narrow scope of the holding apparent, some cau-\n    tionary observations are in order. First, the presence of a judgment\n    by Alabama\u2019s highest court invalidating the 1985 Act under the State\n    Constitution is critical here. The outcome might be different were a\n    potentially unlawful practice simply abandoned by state officials af-\n    ter initial use in an election. Cf. Perkins, 400 U. S., at 395. Second,\n    the 1985 Act was challenged the first time it was invoked and struck\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

The same result would not necessarily fol-\n  low if a practice were invalidated only after enforcement without\n  challenge in several previous elections. Cf. Young, 520 U. S., at 283.\n  Finally, the consequence of the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s Stokes de-\n  cision was to reinstate a practice\u2014gubernatorial appointment\u2014\n  identical to the State\u2019s \u00a75 baseline. Preclearance might well have\n  been required had the court instead ordered the State to adopt a\n  novel practice.

YVONNE KENNEDY ET AL.\nON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR\n          THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA\n                                 [May 27, 2008]\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case presents a novel question concerning \u00a75 of the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965. The setting, in a nutshell: A\ncovered State passed a law adopting a new election prac\u00ad\ntice, obtained the preclearance required by \u00a75, and held an\nelection. Soon thereafter, the law under which the elec\u00ad\ntion took place was invalidated by the State\u2019s highest\ncourt on the ground that it violated a controlling provision\nof the State\u2019s Constitution. The question presented: Must\nthe State obtain fresh preclearance in order to reinstate\nthe election practice prevailing before enactment of the\nlaw struck down by the State\u2019s Supreme Court? We hold\nthat, for \u00a75 purposes, the invalidated law never gained\n\u201cforce or effect.\u201d Therefore, the State\u2019s reversion to its\nprior practice did not rank as a \u201cchange\u201d requiring pre\u00ad\nclearance.\n                             I\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), 79 Stat. 437, as\namended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973 et seq., \u201cwas designed by\nCongress to banish the blight of racial discrimination in\nvoting, which ha[d] infected the electoral process in parts\n2                     RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof our country for nearly a century.\u201d South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308 (1966). In three earlier\nstatutes, passed in 1957, 1960, and 1964, Congress had\nempowered the Department of Justice (DOJ or Depart\u00ad\nment) to combat voting discrimination through \u201ccase-by\u00ad\ncase litigation.\u201d Id., at 313. These lawsuits, however,\nmade little headway. Voting-rights suits were \u201cunusually\nonerous to prepare\u201d and the progress of litigation was\n\u201cexceedingly slow,\u201d in no small part due to the obstruction\u00ad\nist tactics of state officials. Id., at 314. Moreover, some\nStates \u201cresorted to the extraordinary stratagem of contriv\u00ad\ning new rules of various kinds for the sole purpose of\nperpetuating voting discrimination in the face of adverse\nfederal court decrees.\u201d Id., at 335.\n   The VRA reflected Congress\u2019 determination that\n\u201csterner and more elaborate measures\u201d were needed to\ncounteract these formidable hindrances. Id., at 309.\nSections 4 and 5 impose the most stringent of the Act\u2019s\nremedies. Under \u00a74(b), as amended, a State or political\nsubdivision is a so-called \u201ccovered jurisdiction\u201d if, on one of\nthree specified coverage dates: (1) it maintained a literacy\nrequirement or other \u201ctest or device\u201d as a prerequisite to\nvoting, and (2) fewer than 50% of its voting-age citizens\nwere registered to vote or voted in that year\u2019s Presidential\nelection. 42 U. S. C. A. \u00a71973b(b) (Supp. 2007). Section\n4(a) suspends the operation of all such \u201ctest[s] or device[s]\u201d\nin covered jurisdictions. \u00a71973b(a) (main ed. and Supp.\n2007). Section 5 requires covered jurisdictions to obtain\nwhat has come to be known as \u201cpreclearance\u201d from the\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia or the DOJ\nbefore \u201cenact[ing] or seek[ing] to administer\u201d any altera\u00ad\ntion of their practices or procedures affecting voting.\n\u00a71973c(a) (Supp. 2007).\n   A change will be precleared only if it \u201cneither has the\npurpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging\nthe right to vote on account of race or color, or [because of\n                   Cite as: 553 U.

An\nelection practice has the \u201ceffect\u201d of \u201cdenying or abridging\nthe right to vote\u201d if it \u201clead[s] to a retrogression in the\nposition of racial [or language] minorities with respect to\ntheir effective exercise of the electoral franchise.\u201d Beer v.\nUnited States, 425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976). See also Young\nv. Fordice, 520 U. S. 273, 276 (1997); 28 CFR \u00a751.54\n(2007). As amended in 2006, the statute defines \u201cpurpose\u201d\nto include \u201cany discriminatory purpose.\u201d 120 Stat. 581,\ncodified at 42 U. S. C. A. \u00a71973c(c) (Supp. 2007).\n   Congress took the extraordinary step of requiring cov\u00ad\nered jurisdictions to preclear all changes in their voting\npractices because it \u201cfeared that the mere suspension of\nexisting tests [in \u00a74(a)] would not completely solve the\nproblem, given the history some States had of simply\nenacting new and slightly different requirements with the\nsame discriminatory effect.\u201d Allen v. State Bd. of Elec-\ntions, 393 U. S. 544, 548 (1969). By putting the burden on\ncovered jurisdictions to demonstrate that future changes\nwould not be discriminatory, \u00a75 served to \u201cshift the advan\u00ad\ntage of time and inertia from the perpetrators of the evil to\nits victims.\u201d Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 328.\n   Sections 4 and 5 were originally scheduled to lapse once\na covered jurisdiction complied with \u00a74(a)\u2019s ban on the use\nof tests and devices for five years. See 79 Stat. 438.

Composed of three members elected by separate\ndistricts to four-year terms, the Commission has the power\nto levy taxes, make appropriations, and exercise other\ncounty-wide executive and administrative functions. See\nAla. Code \u00a711\u20133\u201311 (1975).\n  We set out first, as pivotal to our resolution of this case,\na full account of two disputes over the means of filling\nmidterm vacancies on the Commission. The first occurred\nbetween 1985 and 1988; the second began in 2004 and\nculminates in the appeal now before us.\n                            A\n   Alabama is a covered jurisdiction with a coverage date\nof November 1, 1964. See 30 Fed. Reg. 9897 (1965). As of\nthat date, Alabama law provided that midterm vacancies\non all county commissions were to be filled by gubernato\u00ad\nrial appointment. See Ala. Code \u00a712\u20136 (1959). The rele\u00ad\nvant provision was later recodified without substantive\nchange as Ala. Code \u00a711\u20133\u20136 (1975), which stated:\n      \u201cIn case of a vacancy, it shall be filled by appoint\u00ad\n    ment by the governor, and the person so appointed\n    shall hold office for the remainder of the term of the\n    commissioner in whose place he is appointed.\u201d\nIn 1985, however, the state legislature passed a \u201clocal law\u201d\nproviding that any vacancy on the Mobile County Com\u00ad\nmission occurring \u201cwith twelve months or more remaining\non the term of the vacant seat\u201d would be filled by special\nelection rather than gubernatorial appointment. 1985\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

Acts no. 85\u2013237 (1985 Act).2 The DOJ precleared this\nnew law in June 1985.\n   The first midterm opening on the Commission postpas\u00ad\nsage of the 1985 Act occurred in 1987, when the seat for\nDistrict One\u2014a majority African-American district\u2014\nbecame vacant. In accord with the 1985 Act, the Governor\ncalled a special election. A Mobile County voter, Willie\nStokes, promptly filed suit in state court seeking to enjoin\nthe election. The 1985 Act, he alleged, violated Art. IV,\n\u00a7105, of the Alabama Constitution, which provides that no\n\u201clocal law . . . shall be enacted in any case which is pro\u00ad\nvided for by a general law.\u201d On Stokes\u2019s reading, the 1985\nAct conflicted with \u00a7105 because the Act addressed a\nmatter already governed by Ala. Code \u00a711\u20133\u20136.\n   The state trial court rejected Stokes\u2019s argument and\nentered judgment for the state defendants. Stokes imme\u00ad\ndiately appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court and\nsought an order staying the election pending that court\u2019s\ndecision. The requested stay was denied and the special\nelection went forward in June 1987. The winner, Samuel\nJones, took office as District One\u2019s Commissioner in July\n1987. Approximately 14 months later, however, in Sep\u00ad\ntember 1988, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the\ntrial court\u2019s judgment. Finding that the 1985 Act \u201cclearly\noffend[ed] \u00a7105 of the [Alabama] Constitution,\u201d the court\ndeclared the Act unconstitutional. Stokes v.

Once again, the method of filling the\nvacancy became the subject of litigation. In 2004, the\nstate legislature had passed (and the DOJ had precleared)\nan amendment to Ala. Code \u00a711\u20133\u20136 providing that va\u00ad\ncancies on county commissions were to be filled by guber\u00ad\nnatorial appointment \u201c[u]nless a local law authorizes a\nspecial election.\u201d 2004 Ala.

The 2004 Act\u2019s authorization of local\nlaws providing for special elections, they urged, had re\u00ad\nvived the 1985 Act and cured its infirmity under \u00a7105 of\nthe Alabama Constitution. Adopting Kennedy\u2019s view, the\nstate trial court ordered Governor Riley to call a special\nelection.\n   While the Governor\u2019s appeal to the Alabama Supreme\nCourt was pending, Mobile County\u2019s election officials\nobtained preclearance of procedures for a special election,\nscheduled to take place in January 2006.

Holding that the 2004 Act \u201cprovide[d]\nfor prospective application only\u201d and thus did not resur\u00ad\nrect the 1985 Act, Alabama\u2019s highest court ruled that\n\u201cGovernor Riley [wa]s authorized to fill the vacancy on the\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

It then determined that\nthe 1985 Act\u2019s provision requiring special elections had\nbeen both precleared and put into \u201cforce or effect\u201d with the\nspecial election of Jones in 1987. It followed, the District\nCourt reasoned, that the gubernatorial appointment called\nfor by Stokes and Kennedy ranked as a change from the\nbaseline practice; consequently \u201cthe two [Alabama Su\u00ad\npreme Court] decisions . . . should have been precleared\nbefore they were implemented.\u201d 445 F.

Without conceding that\npreclearance was required, the State submitted the deci\u00ad\nsions to the DOJ. Finding that the State had failed to\nprove that the reinstatement of gubernatorial appoint\u00ad\nment would not be retrogressive, the Department denied\npreclearance. See App. to Motion to Dismiss or Affirm 2a\u2013\n8                        RILEY v.

On May 1, 2007, the District\nCourt ruled that \u201cGovernor Bob Riley\u2019s appointment of\nJuan Chastang to the Mobile County Commission . . . was\nunlawful under federal law\u201d and vacated the appointment.\nApp. to Juris.

In 2006, the Alabama Legislature enacted a new measure\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III\n   Before reaching the merits of Governor Riley\u2019s appeal,\nwe first take up Kennedy\u2019s threshold objection. The ap\u00ad\npeal, Kennedy urges, must be dismissed as untimely.\n   Section 5 provides that \u201cany appeal\u201d from the decision of\na three-judge district court \u201cshall lie to the Supreme\nCourt.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973c(a). Such an appeal must be\nfiled within 60 days of the District Court\u2019s entry of a final\njudgment. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72101(b). Kennedy maintains\nthat Governor Riley\u2019s May 18, 2007 notice of appeal came\ntoo late because the District Court\u2019s August 2006 order\nqualified as a final judgment. If Kennedy\u2019s characteriza\u00ad\ntion is correct, then Governor Riley\u2019s time to file an appeal\nexpired in October 2006 and his appeal must be dismissed.\nBut if, as Governor Riley maintains, the District Court did\nnot issue a final judgment until the order vacating Chas\u00ad\ntang\u2019s appointment on May 1, 2007, then the Governor\nfiled his appeal well within the required time.\n   A final judgment is \u201cone which ends the litigation on the\nmerits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute\nthe judgment.\u201d Catlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229, 233\n(1945).5 The District Court\u2019s August 2006 order declared\nthat the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Stokes and\nKennedy required preclearance, but that order left unre\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nproviding that, on a going-forward basis, vacancies on the Commission\nwill be filled by special election. See 2006 Ala. Acts no. 2006\u2013342. The\nDOJ precleared the statute in July 2007. The passage of this law does\nnot render this case moot: If the Governor prevails in his appeal,\nChastang may seek reinstatement to the Commission to serve out the\nremainder of the term ending in November 2008. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 5, n. 1.\n  5 Catlin and the other authorities cited in this Part interpret the\n\nmeaning of \u201cfinal decisions\u201d in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291, the statute governing\nappeals from district courts to the courts of appeals. We find them\ninstructive in interpreting the parallel term \u201cfinal\u201d judgment in\n\u00a72101(b).\n10                    RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsolved Kennedy\u2019s demand for injunctive relief. We have\nlong held that an order resolving liability without address\u00ad\ning a plaintiff\u2019s requests for relief is not final. See Liberty\nMut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U. S. 737, 742\u2013743 (1976). See\nalso 15B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Prac\u00ad\ntice and Procedure \u00a73915.2, p. 271 (2d ed. 1992).\n   Resisting the conclusion these authorities indicate,\nKennedy maintains that the August 2006 order ranked as\na final decision for two reasons. First, she contends, that\norder conclusively settled the key remedial issue, for it\ndirected Governor Riley to seek preclearance of the Ala\u00ad\nbama Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Stokes and Kennedy.\nSee Brief for Appellees 26\u201327. This argument misappre\u00ad\nhends the District Court\u2019s order: Far from requiring the\nGovernor to seek preclearance, the District Court ex\u00ad\npressly allowed for the possibility that he would elect not\nto do so. See 445 F. Supp. 2d, at 1337 (\u201cDefendant Riley is\nto keep the court informed of what action, if any, the State\ndecides to take . . . .\u201d (emphasis added)). Second, Kennedy\nnotes that the District Court directed entry of its August\n2006 order \u201cas a final judgment pursuant to Rule 58 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure,\u201d ibid. See Brief for\nAppellees 27. \u201cThe label used by the District Court,\u201d\nhowever, \u201ccannot control [an] order\u2019s appealability.\u201d Sul-\nlivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 628, n. 7 (1990). See\nalso Wetzel, 424 U. S., at 741\u2013743.\n   Because the District Court did not render its final judg\u00ad\nment until May 1, 2007, Governor Riley\u2019s May 18 notice of\nappeal was timely. We therefore proceed to the merits.\n                            IV\n   Prior to 1985, Alabama filled midterm vacancies on the\nMobile County Commission by gubernatorial appointment.\nThe 1985 Act adopted a different practice\u2014special elec\u00ad\ntions. That new practice was used in one election only,\nheld in 1987. The next year, the Alabama Supreme Court\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermined, in Stokes v. Noonan, that the Act authorizing\nspecial elections was invalid under the State\u2019s Constitu\u00ad\ntion. Properly framed, the issue before us is whether \u00a75\nrequired Alabama to obtain preclearance before reinstat\u00ad\ning the practice of gubernatorial appointment in the wake\nof the decision by its highest court invalidating the spe\u00ad\ncial-election law.6\n   It is undisputed that a \u201cchange\u201d from election to ap\u00ad\npointment is a change \u201cwith respect to voting\u201d and thus\ncovered by \u00a75. See Allen, 393 U. S., at 569\u2013570; Presley v.\nEtowah County Comm\u2019n, 502 U. S. 491, 502\u2013503 (1992).\nWe have also stated that the preclearance requirement\nencompasses \u201cvoting changes mandated by order of a state\ncourt.\u201d Branch v. Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 262 (2003). See\nalso Hathorn v. Lovorn, 457 U. S. 255, 265\u2013266, and n. 16\n(1982). The question is whether, given the circumstances\nhere presented, any \u201cchange\u201d within the meaning of \u00a75\noccurred in this case.\n   In order to determine whether an election practice\nconstitutes a \u201cchange\u201d as that term is defined in our \u00a75\nprecedents, we compare the practice with the covered\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 As framed by the District Court, the issue was whether the Alabama\n\nSupreme Court\u2019s decisions in Stokes v. Noonan and Riley v. Kennedy\nshould have been precleared. See 445 F. Supp. 2d, at 1336. This\nformulation, we conclude, misstates the issue in two technical respects.\nFirst, \u00a75 requires a covered jurisdiction to seek preclearance of any\nchanged \u201cpractice . . . with respect to voting.\u201d 42 U. S. C. A. \u00a71973c(a)\n(Supp. 2007). The \u201cpractice\u201d at issue here is gubernatorial appoint\u00ad\nment. That practice, and not the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion of state law in Stokes and Kennedy, is the proper subject of the \u00a75\ninquiry. Second, as Governor Riley noted, see Brief for Appellant 25, if\nthere was a change requiring preclearance, it came about as a result of\nStokes, not Kennedy. Stokes held that the 1985 Act violated the Ala\u00ad\nbama Constitution, and the State accordingly reinstated the practice of\ngubernatorial appointment with the Governor\u2019s 1988 appointment of\nJones. Kennedy simply determined that the 2004 Act did not resurrect\nthe 1985 Act; that decision itself prompted no change in the State\u2019s\nelection practices.\n12                        RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdiction\u2019s \u201cbaseline.\u201d We have defined the baseline as\nthe most recent practice that was both precleared and \u201cin\nforce or effect\u201d\u2014or, absent any change since the jurisdic\u00ad\ntion\u2019s coverage date, the practice that was \u201cin force or\neffect\u201d on that date. See Young, 520 U. S., at 282\u2013283.\nSee also Presley, 502 U. S., at 495. The question is\n\u201cwhether a State has \u2018enact[ed]\u2019 or is \u2018seek[ing] to adminis\u00ad\nter\u2019 a \u2018practice or procedure\u2019 that is \u2018different\u2019 enough\u201d\nfrom the baseline to qualify as a change. Young, 520 U. S.,\nat 281 (quoting 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973c).7\n   For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the 1985\nAct was never \u201cin force or effect\u201d within the meaning of \u00a75.\nAt all relevant times, therefore, the baseline practice for\nfilling midterm vacancies on the Commission was the pre\u00ad\n1985 practice of gubernatorial appointment. The State\u2019s\nreinstatement of that practice thus did not constitute a\nchange requiring preclearance.\n                             A\n  We have directly addressed the \u00a75 term of art \u201cin force\nor effect\u201d on three prior occasions. As will become clear,\nthese precedents do not control this case because they\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 By its terms, \u00a75 requires preclearance of any election practice that is\n\n\u201cdifferent from that in force or effect on\u201d the relevant coverage date\u2014in\nthis case, November 1, 1964. 42 U. S. C. A. \u00a71973c(a) (Supp. 2007).\nGovernor Riley\u2019s opening brief suggested that this text could be read to\nmean that no preclearance is required if a covered jurisdiction seeks to\nadopt the same practice that was in force or effect on its coverage\ndate\u2014even if, because of intervening changes, that practice is different\nfrom the jurisdiction\u2019s baseline. See Brief for Appellant 26\u201327. In\nresponse, Kennedy and the United States noted that the DOJ, see 28\nCFR \u00a751.12 (2007), and the lower courts to consider the question, see,\ne.g., NAACP, DeKalb Cty. Chapter v.

We need not resolve this dispute because the result in this case\nis the same under either view.

Matthews, 400 U. S. 379 (1971), the ques\u00ad\ntion was what practice had been \u201cin force or effect\u201d in the\ncity of Canton, Mississippi, on that State\u2019s \u00a75 coverage\ndate, November 1, 1964. A 1962 state law required selec\u00ad\ntion of city aldermen by at-large elections rather than by\nward. Canton, however, \u201cignored the mandate [of the\nstatute] in the conduct of the 1965 municipal elections\nand, as in 1961, elected aldermen by wards.\u201d Id., at 394.\nIn the 1969 election, the city sought to switch to at-large\nelections. We held that this move was a change requiring\npreclearance because election by ward was \u201cthe procedure\nin fact \u2018in force or effect\u2019 in Canton on November 1, 1964.\u201d\nId., at 395.\n   We endeavored to determine in Perkins the voting pro\u00ad\ncedure that would have been followed on the coverage\ndate, November 1, 1964. Two choices were apparent: the\nstate law on the books since 1962 calling for at-large\nelections, or the practice Canton actually used, without\nchallenge, in 1965\u2014election by wards. We picked the 1965\npractice as the more likely indicator of the practice Canton\nwould have employed had it held an election on the cover\u00ad\nage date, just seven months earlier. See id., at 394\u2013395.\n   Similarly, in City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S.\n125 (1983), the question was what practice had been \u201cin\nforce or effect\u201d in Lockhart, Texas, on the relevant \u00a75\ncoverage date, November 1, 1972. For more than 50 years,\nwithout challenge, the city had used a \u201cnumbered-post\u201d\nsystem to elect its city council. See id., at 132, n. 6.8 A\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Under the \u201cnumbered post\u201d system, \u201cthe two commissioner posts\n\nwere designated by number, and each candidate for commissioner\nspecified the post for which he or she sought election.\u201d City of Lockhart\nv.

KENNEDY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ngroup of plaintiffs nonetheless contended that the num\u00ad\nbered-post system was never \u201cin force or effect\u201d because it\nlacked state-law authorization. We noted that the validity\nof the numbered-post system under state law was \u201cnot\nentirely clear.\u201d Id., at 132.9 Relying on Perkins, we con\u00ad\nsidered the uncertain state of Texas law \u201cirrelevant,\u201d for\n\u201c[t]he proper comparison [wa]s between the new system\nand the system actually in effect on November 1, 1972,\nregardless of what state law might have required.\u201d 460\nU. S., at 132 (footnote omitted).\n   Finally, in Young v. Fordice, decided in 1997, the ques\u00ad\ntion was whether a provisional voter registration plan\nimplemented by Mississippi election officials had been \u201cin\nforce or effect.\u201d Believing that the state legislature was\nabout to amend the relevant law, the officials had pre\u00ad\npared and obtained preclearance for a new voter registra\u00ad\ntion scheme. See 520 U. S., at 279. Roughly one-third of\nthe State\u2019s election officials implemented the plan, regis\u00ad\ntering around 4,000 voters. See id., at 278, 283. As it\nturned out, however, the state legislature failed to pass\nthe amendment, and the voters who had registered under\nthe provisional plan were required to reregister. See id.,\nat 278. When the case reached us, we rejected the argu\u00ad\nment that \u201cthe [p]rovisional [p]lan, because it was pre-\ncleared by the Attorney General, became part of the base\u00ad\nline against which to judge whether a future change must\nbe precleared.\u201d Id., at 282. Regarding the provisional\nplan as a \u201ctemporary misapplication of state law,\u201d we held\nthat, for \u00a75 purposes, the plan was \u201cnever \u2018in force or\neffect.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. We emphasized that the officials who im\u00ad\nplemented the provisional plan \u201cdid not intend to adminis\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ngreatest number of votes are elected.\u201d Id., at 127, n. 1.\n  9 We commented in this regard that the longevity of the numbered-\n\npost system \u201csuggest[ed] a presumption of legality under state law.\u201d\nId., at 132, n. 6.\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

We\nalso noted that the provisional plan had been used for only\n41 days and that the State \u201cheld no elections\u201d during that\nperiod. Ibid.\n                               B\n   Perkins and Lockhart established that an election prac\u00ad\ntice may be \u201cin force or effect\u201d for \u00a75 purposes despite its\nillegality under state law if, as a practical matter, it was\n\u201cactually in effect.\u201d Lockhart, 460 U. S., at 132. Our more\nrecent decision in Young, however, qualified that general\nrule: A practice best characterized as nothing more than a\n\u201ctemporary misapplication of state law,\u201d we held, is not in\n\u201cforce or effect,\u201d even if actually implemented by state\nelection officials. 520 U. S., at 282.\n   If the only relevant factors were the length of time a\npractice was in use and the extent to which it was imple\u00ad\nmented, this would be a close case falling somewhere\nbetween the two poles established by our prior decisions.\nOn one hand, as in Young, the 1985 Act was a \u201ctemporary\nmisapplication\u201d of state law: It was on the books for just\nover three years and applied as a voting practice only\nonce. In Lockhart, by contrast, the city had used the\nnumbered-post system \u201cfor over 50 years without chal\u00ad\nlenge.\u201d 460 U. S., at 132, n. 6. (Perkins is a less clear\ncase: The city failed to alter its practice in response to\nchanged state law for roughly seven years, but only a\nsingle election was held during that period. See 400 U. S.,\nat 394.) On the other hand, in Young no election occurred\nduring the time the provisional registration plan was in\nuse, while in this case one election was held under the\nlater-invalidated 1985 Act.\n   We are convinced, however, that an extraordinary cir\u00ad\ncumstance not present in any past case is operative here,\nimpelling the conclusion that the 1985 Act was never \u201cin\n16                       RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nforce or effect\u201d: The Act was challenged in state court at\nfirst opportunity, the lone election was held in the shadow\nof that legal challenge, and the Act was ultimately invali\u00ad\ndated by the Alabama Supreme Court.\n   These characteristics plainly distinguish the present\ncase from Perkins and Lockhart. The state judiciary had\nno involvement in either of those cases, as the practices at\nissue were administered without legal challenge of any\nkind. And in Lockhart, we justified our unwillingness to\nincorporate a practice\u2019s legality under state law into the \u00a75\n\u201cforce or effect\u201d inquiry in part on this ground: \u201cWe\ndoubt[ed] that Congress intended\u201d to require \u201cthe Attorney\nGeneral and the District Court for the District of Colum\u00ad\nbia\u201d to engage in \u201cspeculation as to state law.\u201d 460 U. S.,\nat 133, n. 8. Here, in contrast, the 1985 Act\u2019s invalidity\nunder the Alabama Constitution has been definitively\nestablished by the Alabama Supreme Court.\n   The prompt legal challenge and the Alabama Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision not only distinguish this case from Per-\nkins and Lockhart; they also provide strong cause to con\u00ad\nclude that, in the context of \u00a75, the 1985 Act was never \u201cin\nforce or effect.\u201d A State\u2019s highest court is unquestionably\n\u201cthe ultimate exposito[r] of state law.\u201d Mullaney v.\nWilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 691 (1975). And because the pre\u00ad\nrogative of the Alabama Supreme Court to say what Ala\u00ad\nbama law is merits respect in federal forums,10 a law\nchallenged at first opportunity and invalidated by Ala\u00ad\nbama\u2019s highest court is properly regarded as null and void\nab initio, incapable of effecting any change in Alabama\nlaw or establishing a voting practice for \u00a75 purposes.\nIndeed, Kennedy and the United States appear to concede\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The dissent observes that the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\n\nStokes was not unanimous. See post, at 8\u20139. Like this Court, the\nAlabama Supreme Court does not shy away from revealing dissenting\nopinions. Of course, it is the majority opinion that declares what state\nlaw is.\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the 1985 Act would not have been \u201cin force or effect\u201d\nhad the Alabama Supreme Court stayed the 1987 election\npending its decision in Stokes (or simply issued its decision\nsooner). See Brief for Appellees 51; Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 23\u201324.\n  There is no good reason to hold otherwise simply be\u00ad\ncause Alabama\u2019s highest court, proceeding at a pace\nhardly uncommon in litigated controversies, did not ren\u00ad\nder its decision until after an election was held. In this\nregard, we have recognized that practical considerations\nsometimes require courts to allow elections to proceed\ndespite pending legal challenges. Cf. Purcell v. Gonzalez,\n549 U. S. 1, 5\u20136 (2006) (per curiam) (\u201cGiven the immi\u00ad\nnence of the election and the inadequate time to resolve\nthe factual disputes, our action today shall of necessity\nallow the election to proceed without an injunction sus\u00ad\npending the [challenged] rules.\u201d).\n  Ruling as Kennedy and the United States urge, more\u00ad\nover, would have the anomalous effect of binding Alabama\nto an unconstitutional practice because of a state trial\ncourt\u2019s error. If the trial court had gotten the law of Ala\u00ad\nbama right, all agree, there would have been no special\nelection and no tenable argument that the 1985 Act had\never gained \u201cforce or effect.\u201d But the trial court miscon\u00ad\nstrued the State\u2019s law and, due to that court\u2019s error, an\nelection took place. That sequence of events, the District\nCourt held, made the Act part of Alabama\u2019s \u00a75 baseline.\nNo precedent of this Court calls for such a holding.\n  The District Court took care to note that its decision\n\u201cd[id] not in any way undermine [Stokes and Kennedy]\nunder state law.\u201d 445 F. Supp. 2d, at 1337. In some theo\u00ad\nretical sense, that may be true. Practically, however, the\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision gave controlling effect to the\nerroneous trial court decision and rendered the Alabama\nSupreme Court\u2019s corrections inoperative.          Alabama\u2019s\nConstitution, that State\u2019s Supreme Court determined,\n18                       RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired that, in the years here involved, vacancies on the\nMobile County Commission be filled by appointment\nrather than special election. Nothing inherent in the\npractice of appointment violates the Fifteenth Amendment\nor the VRA. The DOJ, however, found that a change from\nspecial elections to appointment had occurred in District\nOne, and further found that the change was retrogressive,\nhence barred by \u00a75. The District Court\u2019s final decision,\ntied to the DOJ determination, thus effectively precluded\nthe State from reinstating gubernatorial appointment, the\nonly practice consistent with the Alabama Constitution\npre-2006.11 Indeed, Kennedy\u2019s counsel forthrightly ac\u00ad\nknowledged that the position she defends would \u201cloc[k]\ninto place\u201d an unconstitutional practice. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n32.\n   The dissent, too, appears to concede that its reading of\n\u00a75 would bind Alabama to an unconstitutional practice\nbecause of an error by the state trial court. See post, at 7.\nBut it contends that this imposition is no more \u201coffensive\nto state sovereignty\u201d than \u201ceffectively requiring a State to\nadminister a law it has repealed,\u201d post, at 8\u2014a routine\nconsequence of \u00a75. The result described by the dissent,\nhowever, follows directly from the Constitution\u2019s instruc\u00ad\ntion that a state law may not be enforced if it conflicts\nwith federal law. See Art. VI, cl. 2. Section 5 prohibits\nStates from making retrogressive changes to their voting\npractices, and thus renders any such changes unenforce\u00ad\nable. To be sure, this result constrains States\u2019 legislative\nfreedom. But the rule advocated by the dissent would\neffectively preclude Alabama\u2019s highest court from applying\nto a state law a provision of the State Constitution entirely\nharmonious with federal law. That sort of interference\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 As earlier noted, see supra, at 8\u20139, n. 4, the Alabama Legislature\n\nmodified the relevant state law in 2006 by adopting special elections on\na going-forward basis.\n                   Cite as: 553 U.

The\nrealities of election litigation are such that lower state\ncourts often allow elections to proceed based on erroneous\ninterpretations of state law later corrected on appeal.

We\ndecline to adopt a rigid interpretation of \u201cin force or effect\u201d\nthat would deny state supreme courts the opportunity to\ncorrect similar errors in the future.\n                              C\n  Although our reasoning and the particular facts of this\ncase should make the narrow scope of our holding appar\u00ad\nent, we conclude with some cautionary observations.\nFirst, the presence of a judgment by Alabama\u2019s highest\ncourt declaring the 1985 Act invalid under the State Con\u00ad\nstitution is critical to our decision.12 We do not suggest\nthe outcome would be the same if a potentially unlawful\npractice had simply been abandoned by state officials after\ninitial use in an election. Cf. Perkins, 400 U. S., at 395.\nSecond, the 1985 Act was challenged the first time it was\ninvoked and struck down shortly thereafter. The same\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 There is no indication in the record that the Alabama Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s decisions in Stokes and Kennedy were anything other than\nreasonable and impartial interpretations of controlling Alabama law.\n20                       RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nresult would not necessarily follow if a practice were in\u00ad\nvalidated only after enforcement without challenge in\nseveral previous elections. Cf. Young, 520 U. S., at 283\n(\u201c[T]he simple fact that a voting practice is unlawful under\nstate law does not show, entirely by itself, that the prac\u00ad\ntice was never \u2018in force or effect.\u2019 . . . A State, after all,\nmight maintain in effect for many years a plan that tech\u00ad\nnically . . . violated some provision of state law.\u201d). Finally,\nthe consequence of the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s decision\nin Stokes was to reinstate a practice\u2014gubernatorial ap\u00ad\npointment\u2014identical to the State\u2019s \u00a75 baseline.

The Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s\nhistorical role in administering the State\u2019s discriminatory literacy test,\nthe dissent contends, \u201cindicates that state courts must be treated on the\nsame terms as state legislatures for \u00a75 purposes,\u201d post, at 9. But it is\ncommon ground that a \u201cchange\u201d made pursuant to a state-court order is\nsubject to \u00a75 scrutiny; the only question is whether the Alabama\nSupreme Court\u2019s ruling in Stokes triggered a \u201cchange\u201d within the\nmeaning of our decisions. See supra, at 11; post, at 8. More impor\u00ad\ntantly, none of the past discriminatory actions by the state court\nidentified in the dissent would have been sheltered from \u00a75 review by\nour tightly bounded decision in this case.\n                   Cite as: 553 U.

The principal\nevents at issue in this case occurred in the 1980\u2019s, when\nthe State\u2019s transition from a blatantly discriminatory\nregime was well underway.\n  Nevertheless, since Congress recently decided to renew\nthe VRA,1 and our task is to interpret that statute, we\nmust give the VRA the same generous interpretation that\nour cases have consistently endorsed throughout its his-\ntory.

The critical question in this case is whether the\nprocedure for selecting Mobile County Commissioners\narising out of Stokes\u2014gubernatorial appointment\u2014is a\n\u201cchange\u201d under \u00a75.\n  As an initial matter, the language of \u00a75 requires that\nthe practice be \u201cdifferent from that in force or effect on\nNovember 1, 1964.\u201d It is undisputed that the practice in\nforce or effect in 1964 was gubernatorial appointment, see\nAla. Code \u00a712\u20136 (1959); the practice of calling a special\nelection to fill midterm openings on the Mobile County\nCommission was not introduced until the passage of\nAlabama Act No. 85\u2013237 (1985 Act), 1985 Ala. Acts no.\n85\u2013237.\n  The argument that a return to gubernatorial appoint-\nment will never require preclearance under \u00a75 because\ngubernatorial appointment was the practice in effect in\n1964 is neither persuasive nor properly before the Court.\nAppellant expressly abandoned any such argument in his\nbriefs to this Court.

Reflecting the fact that Con-\ngress certainly did not intend \u00a75 to create a \u201csafe harbor\u201d\nfor voting practices identical to practices in effect in 1964,\nthe settled understanding among lower courts and the\nDepartment of Justice is that \u00a75 operates instead as a\nratchet, freezing in place the most recent voting practice.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16\u201318 (col-\nlecting cases); 28 CFR \u00a751.12 (2007). Furthermore, Con-\ngress has reauthorized the VRA in the face of this under-\nstanding without amending the relevant language of \u00a75.\nSee Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments\nAct of 2006, 120 Stat. 577; ante, at 3, n. 1 (describing the\nhistory of renewals and extensions of the VRA). Thus, the\ninclusion of the date 1964 in the language of \u00a75 poses no\nobstacle to my conclusion that Stokes\u2014even though it\nreturned to gubernatorial practice\u2014implemented a change\nin voting practice that required preclearance.\n                             II\n   Whether a voting practice represents a change that\nrequires preclearance is measured against the previously\nprecleared \u201cbaseline\u201d practice in force or effect.

There we considered whether\nthe practice of using numbered posts for elections was in\nforce on the relevant coverage date and concluded that\ndespite the possibility that this practice was illegal under\nTexas law, the numbered-post system could serve as the\nbaseline.

In 1994, Missis-\nsippi began modifying its registration practices in an\nattempt to comply with the National Voter Registration\nAct of 1993, 107 Stat. 77, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973gg et seq. (2000\ned. and Supp. V). In late 1994, the Mississippi Secretary\nof State proposed a series of changes and assumed that\nthe Mississippi Legislature would adopt those changes.\nThe Secretary of State told at least one election official to\nbegin registering voters under the new plan. The pro-\nposed changes were precleared, and about 4,000 voters\nwere registered. The legislature failed to adopt the pro-\nposal, however, and the registrants were notified that they\nwere not, as they had thought, registered to vote in state\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

We held\nthat the provisional registration system was not the base-\nline because it was never in force or effect.\n   An ordinary observer asked to describe voting practice\nin Alabama with respect to the method of filling vacancies\non the Mobile County Commission would no doubt state\nthat before 1985 the practice was gubernatorial appoint-\nment, between 1985 and 1988 the practice was special\nelection, and beginning in 1988 the practice changed to\ngubernatorial appointment.\n   In the face of this history, the Court comes to the star-\ntling conclusion that for purposes of the VRA Alabama has\nnever ceased to practice gubernatorial appointment as its\nmethod of selecting members of the Mobile County Com-\nmission. But under our case law interpreting \u00a75, it is clear\nthat a change occurred in 1988 when Stokes returned\nAlabama to gubernatorial appointment.2 This represented\na change because the relevant baseline was the special\nelection procedure mandated by the Alabama Legislature\u2019s\nenactment of the 1985 Act, which was precleared by the\nDepartment of Justice in June 1985. Pursuant to that\nlaw, the Governor called a special election when a vacancy\narose in 1987. The vacancy was filled and the newly\nelected commissioner took office in July 1987 serving, by\nway of his election, until September 1988.\n   It is difficult to say that the special election practice was\nnever \u201cin force or effect\u201d with a straight face. Jones was\nelected and sat on the three-member Mobile County\nCommission for approximately 14 months. During those\n14 months, the County Commission held dozens of meet-\nings, at which the Commission exercised its executive and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Even the majority cannot escape this conclusion, stating that \u201c[t]he\n\nState\u2019s reinstatement of th[e] practice [of gubernatorial appointment]\ndid not constitute a change requiring preclearance.\u201d Ante, at 12 (em-\nphasis added); see also, e.g., ante, at 7, 12. Of course, if there was no\nchange, then there was nothing to reinstate.\n6                    RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nadministrative functions. During the time he served as a\nresult of the special election, Jones was central to actions\nhaving a direct and immediate impact on Mobile County.\nFor example, at a meeting held on October 13, 1987, the\nCommission considered 25 agenda items, one of which was\npaying claims and payrolls of over $1 million. Minutes\nfrom Meeting Oct. 13, 1987.\n   The differences between this case and Fordice are le-\ngion. In holding that the provisional registration system\nin Fordice did not constitute the baseline by which to\nmeasure future practices, we emphasized that the plan\nwas abandoned as soon as it was clear that it would not be\nenacted, the plan was in use for only 41 days, and only\nabout one-third of the election officials had even imple-\nmented the proposal. 520 U. S., at 283. Further, the\nState rectified the situation far in advance of any elec-\ntions; there was no evidence that anyone was prevented\nfrom voting because of reliance on the rejected plan. Ibid.\n   Fordice was in essence a case of \u201cno harm, no foul.\u201d\nHere, of course, the special election did take place and the\nelected commissioner held his post for 14 months, voting\non hundreds of measures shaping the governance of Mo-\nbile County. While the voters in Fordice could be reregis-\ntered under the new procedures, Jones\u2019 election to the\nCommission and his 14-month service cannot be undone.\n   The majority seems to acknowledge that Fordice is\ndistinguishable, stating that if \u201cthe only relevant factors\nwere the length of time a practice was in use and the\nextent to which it was implemented, this would be a close\ncase.\u201d Ante, at 15. The Court relies, however, on the\n\u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d that the 1985 Act was chal-\nlenged immediately and that the 1987 election was held\n\u201cin the shadow\u201d of that legal challenge. Ante, at 15\u201316.\nBut a cloud of litigation cannot undermine the obvious\nconclusion that the special election practice was in force or\neffect. That practice, therefore, is the practice to which\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)              7\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ngubernatorial appointment must be compared.\n  The majority makes much of the fact that to adopt the\nview of the three-judge District Court would make the\nquestion whether a voting practice is \u201cin force or effect\u201d\nturn on whether the circuit court happened to get the law\nright in time to stop the election. Ante, at 17. But the\nmajority\u2019s approach turns instead on whether Alabama\npossesses highly motivated private litigants. If Stokes had\nnot challenged the election until it had already taken\nplace (or had failed to appeal), the election would be in\nforce or effect under the majority\u2019s view. Nothing in the\nVRA or our cases suggests that the VRA\u2019s application\nshould hinge on how quickly private litigants challenge\nvoting laws.\n  Our decisions in Perkins and Lockhart give no indication\nthat if a citizen in Canton, Mississippi or Lockhart, Texas\nhad challenged the legality of the ward elections or the\nnumbered-post system, the illegality of those practices\nunder state law would have been any more relevant to\ntheir status as the relevant baselines. This case calls for\nnothing more than a straightforward application of our\nprecedent; that precedent makes clear that the special\nelection procedure was the relevant baseline and that\ngubernatorial appointment therefore represents a change\nthat must be precleared.\n                              III\n   The VRA makes no distinction among the paths that can\nlead to a change in voting practice, requiring preclearance\n\u201cwhenever\u201d a State seeks to enact \u201cany\u201d change in voting\npractice. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973c. And changes to voting prac-\ntice can arise in at least four ways: (1) legislative enact-\nment; (2) executive action; (3) judicial changes, either by a\nproactive judicial decision (e.g., redistricting) or, as in this\ncase, through judicial interpretation of state law; or (4)\ninformal abandonment or adoption by election officials.\n8                     RILEY v. KENNEDY\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n  The majority does not dispute that a change in voting\npractice wrought by a state court can be subject to pre-\nclearance. See ante, at 11 (citing Branch v. Smith, 538\nU. S. 254 (2003), and Hathorn v. Lovorn, 457 U. S. 255\n(1982)). But the majority falters when it treats the change\neffected by Stokes differently for \u00a75 preclearance purposes\nthan it would treat a newly enacted statute or executive\nregulation. The majority finds it \u201canomalous\u201d that Ala-\nbama might be bound \u201cto an unconstitutional practice\nbecause of a state trial court\u2019s error.\u201d Ante, at 17. The\nclear theme running through the majority\u2019s analysis is\nthat the Alabama Supreme Court is more deserving of\ncomity than the Alabama Legislature.\n  Imagine that the 1985 Act had been held constitutional\nby the Alabama Supreme Court in Stokes, but that in 1988\nthe Alabama Legislature changed its mind and repealed\nthe Act, enacting in its place a statute providing for gu-\nbernatorial appointment. Imagine further that the De-\npartment of Justice refused to preclear the practice (as it\nno doubt would); if Alabama wanted to fill an open seat on\nthe Mobile County Commission it would have to adminis-\nter its former special election practice even though that\nlaw had been repealed. It is not clear to me or to the\nUnited States, see Brief as Amicus Curiae 25\u201327, why\neffectively requiring a State to administer a law it has\nrepealed is less offensive to state sovereignty than requir-\ning a State to administer a law its highest court has found\nunconstitutional. The VRA \u201cby its nature, intrudes on\nstate sovereignty.\u201d Lopez v. Monterey County, 525 U. S.\n266, 284 (1999).\n  The majority attempts to portray the circuit court\njudge\u2019s decision as so far outside the bounds of Alabama\nlaw, see ante, at 17, that allowing it to effectively establish\nthe special election practice as a \u00a75 baseline would be\nintolerable.
