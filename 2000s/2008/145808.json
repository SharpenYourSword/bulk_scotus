We reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>At issue in this case is respondent's sentence on his 2004 conviction in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Respondent had two prior state convictions in California for residential burglary and three state convictions in Washington for delivery of a controlled substance, in violation of Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(1)(ii)-(iv) (1994).<sup>[1]</sup> Respondent's three Washington drug convictions occurred on the same day but were based on deliveries that took place on three separate dates. Sentencing Order No. CR-03-142-RHW (ED Wash., Sept. 3, 2004), p. 5, App. 245, 250 (hereinafter Sentencing Order). At the time of respondent's drug offenses, the Washington statute that respondent was convicted of violating stated that, upon conviction, a defendant could be \"imprisoned for not more than five years,\" \u00a7\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(1)(ii)-(iv), but another provision specified that \"[a]ny person convicted of a second or subsequent offense\" could \"be imprisoned for a term up to twice the term otherwise authorized,\" \u00a7 69.50.408(a). Thus, by virtue of this latter, recidivist, provision respondent faced a maximum penalty of imprisonment for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1787</span> 10 years. The judgment of conviction for each of the drug-delivery charges listed the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense as \"ten years,\" App. 16, 42, 93, but the state court sentenced respondent to concurrent sentences of 48 months' imprisonment on each count. <i>Id.,</i> at 21, 47, 98.</p>\n<p>In the federal felon-in-possession case, the Government asked the District Court to sentence respondent under ACCA, which sets a 15-year minimum sentence \"[i]n the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of [Title 18] and has three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another . . . .\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The Government argued that respondent's two prior California burglary convictions were for \"`violent felonies.'\" Pet. for Cert. 4. See \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2000 ed.) (listing \"burglary\" as a \"violent felony\"). The District Court agreed, and that ruling is not at issue here.</p>\n<p>The Government also argued that at least two of respondent's Washington drug convictions were for \"serious drug offense[s].\" Under ACCA, a \"serious drug offense\" includes:</p>\n<blockquote>\"an offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to distribute, a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)), <i>for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.</i>\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>Because the maximum term that respondent faced on at least two of the Washington charges was 10 years, the Government contended that these convictions had to be counted under ACCA. The District Court disagreed, holding that respondent's drug-trafficking convictions were not convictions for \"serious drug offense[s]\" under ACCA because the \"maximum term of imprisonment\" for the purposes of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) is determined without reference to recidivist enhancements. Sentencing Order, at 9, App. 254.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, applying its prior precedent in <i>United States v. Corona-Sanchez,</i> 291 F.3d 1201 (2002) (en banc), affirmed. 464 F.3d 1072. The Court recognized that its decision conflicted with the Seventh Circuit's decision in <i>United States v. Henton,</i> 374 F.3d 467, 469-470, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 967, 125 S.Ct. 431, 160 L.Ed.2d 336 (2004), and was \"in tension\" with decisions of the Fourth and Fifth Circuits. 464 F.3d, at 1082, n. 6; see <i>Mutascu v. Gonzales,</i> 444 F.3d 710, 712 (C.A.5 2006) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>United States v. Williams,</i> 326 F.3d 535, 539 (C.A.4 2003). We granted the Government's petition for a writ of certiorari, 551 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 33, 168 L.Ed.2d 808 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The question that we must decide is whether the \"maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\" in this case is, as respondent maintains and the Ninth Circuit held, the 5-year ceiling for first offenses or, as the Government contends, the 10-year ceiling for second or subsequent offenses. See Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(ii)-(iv), 69.50.408(a).</p>\n<p>The Government's reading is compelled by the language of ACCA. For present purposes, there are three key statutory terms: \"offense,\" \"law,\" and \"maximum term.\" The \"offense\" in each of the drug-delivery cases was a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(ii)-(iv). The relevant \"law\" is set out in both that provision, which prescribes a \"maximum term\" of five years for a first \"offense,\" and \u00a7 69.50.408(a), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1788</span> which prescribes a \"maximum term\" of 10 years for a second or subsequent \"offense.\" Thus, in this case, the maximum term prescribed by Washington law for at least two of respondent's state drug offenses was 10 years.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit's holding that the maximum term was five years contorts ACCA's plain terms. Although the Washington state court sentenced respondent to 48 months' imprisonment, there is no dispute that \u00a7 69.50.408(a) permitted a sentence of up to 10 years. On the Ninth Circuit's reading of ACCA, even if respondent had been sentenced to, say, six years' imprisonment, \"the maximum term of imprisonment\" prescribed by law still would have been five years. It is hard to accept the proposition that a defendant may lawfully be sentenced to a term of imprisonment that exceeds the \"maximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law,\" but that is where the Ninth Circuit's reading of the statute leads.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit's interpretation is also inconsistent with the way in which the concept of the \"maximum term of imprisonment\" is customarily understood by participants in the criminal justice process. Suppose that a defendant who indisputably had more than three prior convictions for \"violent felon[ies]\" or \"serious drug of-fense[s]\" was charged in federal court with violating the felon-in-possession statute. Under ACCA, this defendant would face a sentence of \"not less than 15 years.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Suppose that the defendant asked his or her attorney, \"What's the maximum term I face for the new offense?\" An attorney aware of ACCA would surely not respond, \"10 years,\" even though 10 years is the maximum sentence without the ACCA enhancement. See \u00a7 924(a)(2) (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p>Suppose that the defendant then pleaded guilty to the felon-in-possession charge. Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(H), the trial judge would be required to advise the defendant of the \"maximum possible penalty.\" If the judge told the defendant that the maximum possible sentence was 10 years and then imposed a sentence of 15 years based on ACCA, the defendant would have been sorely misled and would have a ground for moving to withdraw the plea. See <i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i> 420 F.3d 111, 132 (C.A.2 2005); <i>United States v. Harrington,</i> 354 F.3d 178, 185-186 (C.A2 2004). In sum, a straightforward application of the language of ACCA leads to the conclusion that the \"maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\" in this case was 10 years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In an effort to defend the Ninth Circuit's decision, respondent offers both a textual argument and a related argument based on the \"manifest purpose\" of ACCA. Brief for Respondent 8.</p>\n<p>Respondent's textual argument is as follows. The term \"offense\" \"generally is understood to describe the elements constituting the crime.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 10. Because prior convictions required for recidivist enhancements are not typically offense elements, they should not be considered part of the \"offense\" under ACCA. Thus, the \"maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\" for the drug convictions at issue was the maximum term prescribed for simply committing the elements of the drug offense and was therefore five years. <i>Id.,</i> at 10-11.</p>\n<p>Respondent's argument is not faithful to the statutory text. Respondent reads ACCA as referring to \"the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\" for a defendant <i>with no prior convictions that</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1789</span> <i>trigger a recidivist enhancement,</i> but that is not what ACCA says. ACCA instead refers to \"the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\" for \"an offense,\" and, as previously explained, in this case, the maximum term prescribed by Washington law for each of respondent's two relevant offenses was 10 years.</p>\n<p>Respondent's argument based on ACCA's \"manifest purpose\" must also be rejected. Respondent argues that ACCA uses \"the maximum penalty specified for the offense by state law as a short-hand means of identifying conduct deemed sufficiently `serious' to trigger [the] mandatory penalty.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 9. According to respondent, \"[t]he nature of [a defendant's] conduct, the elements of the offense, and the impact of the crime . . . are the characteristics that typically are used to gauge the `seriousness' of an offense,\" and a defendant's \"status as a recidivist has no connection to whether the offense committed by the defendant was a `serious' one.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 11.</p>\n<p>This argument rests on the erroneous proposition that a defendant's prior record of convictions has no bearing on the seriousness of an offense. On the contrary, however, an offense committed by a repeat offender is often thought to reflect greater culpability and thus to merit greater punishment. Similarly, a second or subsequent offense is often regarded as more serious because it portends greater future danger and therefore warrants an increased sentence for purposes of deterrence and incapacitation. See <i>Witte v. United States,</i> 515 U.S. 389, 403, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995); <i>Spencer v. Texas,</i> 385 U.S. 554, 570, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967) (Warren, C. J., dissenting in two judgments and concurring in one).</p>\n<p>If respondent were correct that a defendant's record of prior convictions has no bearing on the seriousness of an offense, then it would follow that any increased punishment imposed under a recidivist provision would not be based on the offense of conviction but on something else\u0097 presumably the defendant's prior crimes or the defendant's \"status as a recidivist,\" Brief for Respondent 11. But we have squarely rejected this understanding of recidivism statutes. In <i>Nichols v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 738, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994), we explained that \"`[t]his Court consistently has sustained repeat-offender laws as penalizing only the last offense committed by the defendant.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 747, 114 S.Ct. 1921 (quoting <i>Baldasar v. Illinois,</i> 446 U.S. 222, 232, 100 S.Ct. 1585, 64 L.Ed.2d 169 (1980) (Powell, J., dissenting)). When a defendant is given a higher sentence under a recidivism statute\u0097or for that matter, when a sentencing judge, under a guidelines regime or a discretionary sentencing system, increases a sentence based on the defendant's criminal history\u0097100% of the punishment is for the offense of conviction. None is for the prior convictions or the defendant's \"status as a recidivist.\" The sentence \"is a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because [it is] a repetitive one.\" <i>Gryger v. Burke,</i> 334 U.S. 728, 732, 68 S.Ct. 1256, 92 L.Ed. 1683 (1948).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondent argues that our interpretation of ACCA produces \"a sort of perverse bootstrapping\" under which a defendant is \"punished under federal law for being treated as a recidivist under state law,\" Brief for Respondent 20 (emphasis deleted), but the fact that ACCA is itself a recidivist statute bolsters our reading. Since ACCA is a recidivist statute, Congress must have had such provisions in mind and must have understood that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1790</span> \"maximum penalty prescribed by [state] law\" in some cases would be increased by state recidivism provisions.</p>\n<p>Contrary to respondent's suggestion, <i>United States v. LaBonte,</i> 520 U.S. 751, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997), supports our interpretation of ACCA. The statute at issue in <i>LaBonte,</i> a provision of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h), directed the United States Sentencing Commission to \"assure\" that the Sentencing Guidelines specify a prison sentence \"at or near the maximum term authorized for categories of\" adult offenders who commit their third felony drug offense or violent crime. We held that the phrase \"maximum term authorized\" \"refers to all applicable statutes,\" including recidivist enhancements. 520 U.S., at 758, n. 4, 117 S.Ct. 1673.</p>\n<p>Respondent claims that <i>LaBonte</i> supports his position because ACCA, unlike 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h), does not refer to \"categories of\" offenders. Respondent suggests that Congress' failure to include such language in ACCA means that Congress intended to refer to a \"maximum term\" that does not depend on whether a defendant falls into the first-time-offender or recidivist \"category.\" Respondent does not explain how 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A) could have easily been reworded to mirror 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h). But in any event, the language used in ACCA, for the reasons explained above, is more than clear enough.</p>\n<p>Respondent argues that the Ninth Circuit's decision is supported by the so-called \"categorical\" approach that we used in <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), in determining which offenses qualify as \"violent felon[ies]\" under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) provides that four enumerated crimes\u0097 burglary, arson, extortion, and offenses involving the use of explosives\u0097are \"violent felon[ies]\" for ACCA purposes. In <i>Taylor,</i> we held that Congress intended for these crimes to have a \"uniform definition\" that was \"independent of the labels employed by the various States' criminal codes.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 592, 110 S.Ct. 2143. According to respondent, \"[t]he categorical approach rests on the congressional intent\u0097reflected in the statutory language\u0097to focus the ACCA inquiry on the offense of conviction, rather than on collateral matters unrelated to the definition of the crime.\" Brief for Respondent 12.</p>\n<p>We see no connection, however, between the issue in <i>Taylor</i> (the meaning of the term \"burglary\" in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)) and the issue here (the meaning of the phrase \"maximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law\" under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii)). <i>Taylor</i> held that the meaning of \"burglary\" for purposes of ACCA does not depend on the label attached by the law of a particular State, 495 U.S., at 600-601, 110 S.Ct. 2143, but the \"maximum penalty prescribed by law\" for a state offense necessarily depends on state law.</p>\n<p>For a similar reason, we reject respondent's argument that, under our interpretation, offenses that are not really serious will be included as \"serious drug offense[s]\" because of recidivist enhancements. In \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), Congress chose to rely on the \"maximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed\" by state law as the measure of the seriousness of state offenses involving the manufacture, distribution, or possession of illegal drugs. Congress presumably thought\u0097not without reason\u0097that if state lawmakers provide that a crime is punishable by 10 years' imprisonment, the lawmakers must regard the crime as \"serious,\" and Congress chose to defer to the state lawmakers' judgment. Therefore, our interpretation poses no risk that a drug-trafficking offense will be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1791</span> treated as a \"serious\" without satisfying the standard that Congress prescribed.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Respondent argues that it will often be difficult to determine whether a defendant faced the possibility of a recidivist enhancement in connection with a past state drug conviction and that therefore our interpretation of ACCA will require the federal courts to \"engage in difficult inquiries regarding novel questions of state law and complex factual determinations about long-past proceedings in state courts.\" Brief for Respondent 21. Respondent greatly exaggerates the problems to which he refers.</p>\n<p>First, in some cases, a defendant will have received a recidivist enhancement, and this will necessarily be evident from the length of the sentence imposed. Second, as the present case illustrates, see App. 16, 42, 93, the judgment of conviction will sometimes list the maximum possible sentence even where the sentence that was imposed did not exceed the top sentence allowed without any recidivist enhancement. Third, as respondent himself notes, some jurisdictions require that the prosecution submit a formal charging document in order to obtain a recidivist enhancement. See Brief for Respondent 33. Such documents fall within the limited list of generally available documents that courts already consult for the purpose of determining if a past conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate. See <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 20, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). Fourth, in those cases in which the defendant pleaded guilty to the state drug charges, the plea colloquy will very often include a statement by the trial judge regarding the maximum penalty. This is mandated by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(H), and many States have similar requirements.<sup>[3]</sup> Finally, in those cases in which the records that may properly be consulted do not show that the defendant faced the possibility of a recidivist enhancement, it may well be that the Government will be precluded from establishing that a conviction was for a qualifying offense. The mere possibility that some future cases might present difficulties cannot justify a reading of ACCA that disregards the clear meaning of the statutory language.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1792</span> D</h2>\n<p>Respondent's last argument is that if recidivist enhancements can increase the \"maximum term\" of imprisonment under ACCA, it must follow that mandatory guidelines systems that cap sentences can decrease the \"maximum term\" of imprisonment. Brief for Respondent 38. In each situation, respondent argues, the \"maximum term\" of imprisonment is the term to which the state court could actually have sentenced the defendant. Respondent concedes that he has waived this argument with respect to his own specific state-court convictions. See Brief in Opposition 15, n. 7. He argues, however, that Congress cannot have wanted to make the \"maximum term\" of imprisonment for ACCA purposes dependent on the complexities of state sentencing guidelines. We conclude, however, that the phrase \"maximum term of imprisonment. . . prescribed by law\" for the \"offense\" was not meant to apply to the top sentence in a guidelines range.</p>\n<p>First, the top sentence in a guidelines range is generally not really the \"maximum term . . . prescribed by law\" for the \"offense\" because guidelines systems typically allow a sentencing judge to impose a sentence that exceeds the top of the guidelines range under appropriate circumstances. The United States Sentencing Guidelines, for example, permit \"upward departures,\" see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K2.0 (Nov.2007), and essentially the same characteristic was shared by all of the mandatory guidelines system in existence at the time of the enactment of the ACCA provision at issue in this case.<sup>[4]</sup> (Following this pattern, Washington law likewise provided at the time of respondent's state convictions that a sentencing judge could \"impose a sentence outside the standard sentence range\" upon a finding \"that there [were] substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence.\" Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9.94A.120(2) (1994).<sup>[5]</sup>)</p>\n<p>Second, the concept of the \"maximum\" term of imprisonment or sentence prescribed by law was used in many statutes that predated the enactment of ACCA and the federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-473, \u00a7 211, 98 Stat. 1987, and in all those statutes the concept necessarily referred to the maximum term prescribed by the relevant criminal statute, not the top of a sentencing guideline range. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3 (1982 ed.) (\"[A]n accessory after the fact shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment . . . for the punishment of the principal\"); \u00a7 3575(b) (allowing for an increased sentence for dangerous special offenders \"not disproportionate in severity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1793</span> to the maximum term otherwise authorized by law for\" the underlying felony); see also \u00a7 371 (the punishment for conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor \"shall not exceed the maximum punishment provided for such misdemeanor\"); \u00a7 3651 (allowing for confinement and suspension of sentence upon conviction of an offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment \"if the maximum sentence for such offense is more than six months\"); \u00a7 3653 (referring to the \"maximum probation period\").</p>\n<p>It is instructive that, even in the Sentencing Reform Act, the concept of the \"maximum term of imprisonment\" prescribed for an offense was used in this sense. See \u00a7 212, 98 Stat. 1991-1992 (new 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559 classifying offenses based on \"the maximum term of imprisonment authorized . . . by the statute describing the offense\"); \u00a7 235(b)(1)(F), 98 Stat. 2032 (\"The maximum term of imprisonment in effect on the effective date [of the Sentencing Reform Act]\" remains in effect for five years after the effective date \"for an offense committed before the effective date\"); \u00a7 1003(a), <i>id.,</i> at 2138 (solicitation to commit a crime of violence punishable by \"one-half the maximum term of imprisonment. . . prescribed for the punishment of the crime solicited\"). In light of this established pattern and the relative newness of sentencing guidelines systems when the ACCA provision at issue here was added, we conclude that Congress meant for the concept of the \"maximum term of imprisonment\" prescribed by law for an \"offense\" to have same meaning in ACCA.</p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>United States v. R.L.C.,</i> 503 U.S. 291, 112 S.Ct. 1329, 117 L.Ed.2d 559 (1992), is not to the contrary. The statutory provision there, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5037(c) (2000 ed.), set out the term of official detention for a juvenile found to be a delinquent. This provision was amended by the Sentencing Reform Act, see \u00a7 214, 98 Stat. 2013, and then amended again two years later, see \u00a7\u00a7 21(a)(2)-(4), 100 Stat. 3596. As thus amended, the provision did not refer to the \"maximum term of imprisonment\" prescribed for an \"offense.\" Rather, the provision focused on the particular juvenile being sentenced. It provided that, \"`in the case of a juvenile who is less than eighteen years old,'\" official detention could not extend beyond the earlier of two dates: the juvenile's 21st birthday or \"`the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult.'\" <i>United States v. R.L.C., supra,</i> at 295-296, 112 S.Ct. 1329, n. 1 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5037(c)). Because this provision clearly focuses on the circumstances of the particular juvenile and not on the offense, 503 U.S., at 299, 112 S.Ct. 1329, it is not analogous to the ACCA provision that is before us in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we hold that the \"maximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law\" for the state drug convictions at issue in this case was the 10-year maximum set by the applicable recidivist provision. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court chooses one reading of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), over another that would make at least as much sense of the statute's ambiguous text and would follow the counsel of a tradition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1794</span> of lenity in construing perplexing criminal laws. The Court's choice, moreover, promises hard times for the trial courts that will have to make the complex sentencing calculations this decision demands. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The ACCA mandates a 15-year minimum sentence for anyone convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g) (2000 ed.) who \"has three previous convictions [for] a serious drug offense\" among his prior crimes. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Section 924(e)(2)(A) (2000 ed.) defines \"serious drug offense\" as an offense under state or federal drug laws, \"for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\" This limitation leaves open the question whether a given conviction qualifies as \"serious\" by reference to the penalty for the acts making up the basic offense, regardless of who commits it, or whether account must also be taken of further facts (such as an offender's criminal record that qualified him for an enhanced penalty at the time of that earlier conviction). If the first alternative is the reading Congress intended, a sentencing judge needs to look only to the penalty specified for the basic offense committed by a first-time offender. But if the second is the intended one, a judge may have to consider sentencing variations (for using a gun, say, or for repeating the offense) set out in other provisions.</p>\n<p>It all turns on the meaning of the word \"offense,\" to which the \"maximum term\" is tied. One can naturally read \"an offense\" at a general level as synonymous with \"a crime,\" which would tend to rule out reference to maximums adjusted for other facts; we do not usually speak of a crime of \"burglary while having a criminal record and while out on bail.\" Those details would come up only if we were speaking about a specific instance, described as a burglary \"committed by someone with a record while out on bail,\" in which case the other facts may \"enhance\" his sentence beyond what would have been the maximum term for burglary. The trouble is that \"offense\" could easily refer to a specific occurrence, too; looking at it that way would make it less jarring to suggest that the circumstances around an event that authorize higher penalty ranges (such as the use of a gun) or the defendant's history (like a prior conviction) ought to count in identifying the maximum penalty for the offense committed on the given day, at the given place, by the particular offender, in a given way. Either reading seems to offer a plausible take on the \"offense\" for which the ACCA court will have to identify or calculate \"maximum\" penalties, under state law.</p>\n<p>We get no help from imagining the circumstances in which a sentencing court would ask which reading to adopt. The choice of answer would be easy if the question arose in the mind of a lawyer whose client is thinking about a guilty plea and asks what maximum term he faces. See <i>ante,</i> at 1787-1788. His lawyer knows that he means the maximum term for him in his case. When a repeat offender wants to know, counsel understands that the penalty prescribed for the basic crime without the recidivist add-on is not the baseline for comparison that may make or break the potential plea agreement. And if the repeat offender faces a further statutory enhancement for carrying a gun during the offense, or for being out on bail, his lawyer would not tell him the maximum term for repeat offenders without guns or bail restrictions. By the same token, if the offender faced (as Rodriquez did) a lower sentence ceiling than what the statute says, by grace of mandatory sentencing guidelines, his lawyer would know enough <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1795</span> to tell him that his maximum was capped in this way.</p>\n<p>When the issue comes up not in a particular client's questions about his own prospects, however, but in a trial judge's mind wondering about the meaning of the general statute, context gives no ready answer. Nor does it break the tie to say, as the Court does, that taking \"maximum\" to refer to the basic offense would mean that a recidivist with add-ons could be sentenced above the ACCA \"maximum,\" see <i>ante,</i> at 1787 (\"even if respondent had been sentenced to, say, six years' imprisonment, `the maximum term of imprisonment' prescribed by law still would have been five years\"). That description, after all, might be just a verbal quirk showing the statutory design in proper working order: if Congress meant an offense to be viewed generically and apart from offender characteristics, a gap between the maximum for ACCA purposes, and a heavier, actual sentence accounting for a defendant's history is to be expected.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The text does not point to any likelier interpretive choices, and as between these alternatives, it is simply ambiguous.<sup>[2]</sup> Because I do not believe its ambiguity is fairly resolved in the Government's favor, I would affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>None of the Court's three principal points or ripostes solves the puzzle. To begin with, there is something arbitrary about trying to resolve the ambiguity by rejecting the maximum-for-basic-offense option while declining to consider an entire class of offender-based sentencing adjustments. If offender characteristics are going to count in identifying the relevant maximum penalty, it would seem to follow that in jurisdictions with mandatory sentencing guidelines, the maximum \"prescribed by law\" would be what the guidelines determine. The original Federal Guidelines, and the mandatory state guidelines I am aware of, were established under statutory authority that invests a guideline with the same legal status as a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1796</span> customary penalty provision. Cf. <i>United States v. R.L. C.,</i> 503 U.S. 291, 297, 112 S.Ct. 1329, 117 L.Ed.2d 559 (1992) (\"The answer to any suggestion that the statutory character of a specific penalty provision gives it primacy over administrative sentencing guidelines is that the mandate to apply the Guidelines is itself statutory\").</p>\n<p>The Court tries to deflect the implication of its position by denying that state sentencing guidelines really do set maximum penalties, since typically they allow a judge to depart from them, up or down, when specified conditions are met. See <i>ante,</i> at 1792. But while this is true, the objection stands. However a particular mandatory guideline scheme works, it sets a maximum somewhere; if it includes conditions affecting what would otherwise be a guideline maximum, the top of the range as affected should be the relevant maximum on the Court's reading of the statute. Indeed, the factual conditions involved are usually offender characteristics, and if the ACCA is going to count them under offense-defining statutes or freestanding recidivism laws, those same facts ought to count under a guideline rule (whether setting, or authorizing a departure from, a particular limit). There is no practical difference whether maximums are adjusted by a statute, a statutorily mandated guideline, or a guideline-specified departure; wherever a \"prescri[ption] by law\" resides, it ought to be honored by the ACCA court.</p>\n<p>If we were to follow the Court's lights, then, I think we would have to accept the complication that guidelines schemes present, and face the difficulty of calculating enhanced maximums in guidelines jurisdictions.<sup>[3]</sup> What we cannot do is to resolve statutory ambiguity by looking to the sentencing range for an imaginary offender who meets statutory conditions for altering the basic sentence, but is artificially stripped of any characteristic that triggers a guideline rule also \"prescribed by law.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The more fundamental objection, though, goes to the Court's basic conclusion that it makes the better sense to read the ACCA as resting the federal treatment of recidivists on the maximum sentence authorized by state recidivist schemes, in cases where state law must be considered. The Court says it would have been natural for Congress to think in terms of state judgments about repeat criminals when thinking about what to do at the national level, and the Court is quite possibly right about this; the fact that the federal penalty may turn on a state felony classification at all shows that Congress was thinking about state law. But the chances are at least equally good that the Court is wrong; it is odd to think that Congress would have piggybacked the federal system on state repeat-offender schemes, given the extraordinary and irreconcilable variations among state policies on the subject.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the States' recidivism schemes vary in their methods for augmenting sentences. Iowa's law, for example, subjects repeat drug offenders to triple penalties, Iowa Code \u00a7 124.411(1) (2005); but in Wisconsin a repeat drug distributor will see his maximum term increased by a fixed number of years, whatever the starting point, see, <i>e.g.,</i> Wis. Stat. \u00a7 961.48(1)(b) (2003-2004) (4-year increase for Class H felony such as selling 1 kilogram of marijuana).</p>\n<p>More striking than differing structures, though, are the vast disparities in severity from State to State: under Massachusetts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1797</span> drug laws, a third conviction for selling a small amount of marijuana carries a maximum of 2.5 years. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 94C, \u00a7 32C(b) (West 2006). In Delaware, a third conviction means a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole. See Del.Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7 4214(b) (2007) (third-felony penalty of life without parole for violations of non-narcotic controlled substances law, Tit. 16, \u00a7 4752 (2004)). That Congress might have chosen to defer to state-law judgments about \"seriousness\" that vary so widely for the same conduct is at least open to doubt. And that doubt only gets worse when we notice that even where two States have similar maximum penalties for a base-level offense, their recidivist enhancements may lead the same conduct to trigger the ACCA sanction in one State but not the other: on the Court's view, an offender's second conviction for selling, say, just over two pounds of marijuana will qualify as an ACCA predicate crime if the conviction occurred in Arizona (maximum of 13 years), Iowa (15 years), Utah (15 years), and the District of Columbia (10 years), for example;<sup>[4]</sup> but it will fall short of the mark in California (8 years), Michigan (8 years), and New York (8 years).<sup>[5]</sup> Yet in each of these States, the base-level offense has a maximum term falling within a much narrower range (between 3.5 and 5.5 years).<sup>[6]</sup> With this backdrop of state law, the Government can hardly be heard to say that there would be something \"incongruous\" about a federal law targeting offenses flagged by the penalties assigned only to bare conduct, without regard to recidivism or other offender facts. Brief for United States 17.</p>\n<p>Nor does it show what the ACCA means by \"maximum\" or \"offense\" when the Court points to language from our prior cases saying that enhanced recidivist penalties are not to be viewed as retroactive punishment for past crimes, for purposes of double-jeopardy and right-to-counsel enquiries. See <i>ante,</i> at 1789 (citing <i>Nichols v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 738, 747, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994), and <i>Gryger v. Burke,</i> 334 U.S. 728, 732, 68 S.Ct. 1256, 92 L.Ed. 1683 (1948)). The quotations show that a separate offense is identified by an enhanced penalty, the Court says, because from them we can draw the conclusion that \"[w]hen a defendant is given a higher sentence under a recidivism statute,\" nonetheless \"100% of the punishment is for the offense of conviction,\" leaving nothing to be attributed to \"prior convictions or the defendant's `status as a recidivist,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 1789.</p>\n<p>Still, the fact is that state-law maximums for repeat offenders sometimes bear <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1798</span> hardly any relation to the gravity of the triggering offense, as \"three-strikes\" laws (not to mention the Delaware example, above) often show. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, \u00a7 5/33B-1 (2004) (mandatory life sentence for third \"Class X\" felony, such as dealing heroin, without regard to the specific penalty gradation for the latest Class X felony or to any similarity with prior offenses); W. Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 61-11-18(c) (2005) (if offender was \"twice before convicted in the United States of a crime punishable by confinement in a penitentiary,\" third such conviction incurs a mandatory life sentence). Cf. <i>Ewing v. California,</i> 538 U.S. 11, 30, n. 2, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (plurality opinion) (the \"California Legislature therefore made a deliberate policy decision . . . that the gravity of the new felony should not be a determinative factor in triggering the application of the Three Strikes Law\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). And there is no denying that the fact of prior convictions (or a defendant's recidivist status) is necessary for the \"`stiffened penalty'\" to be imposed for \"`the latest crime,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 1789, the necessary fact being specific to the offender, and falling outside the definition of the offense. This is, after all, what it means to apply an \"enhancement.\"</p>\n<p>The upshot is that it may have been natural for Congress to think of state recidivism schemes, but it may well not have been. If there is anything strange about ignoring enhanced penalties, there is something at least as strange about a federal recidivist statute that piles enhancement on enhancement, magnifying the severity of state laws severe to begin with.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Whatever may be the plausibility of the offender-based reading of the statute as the Court describes it, the Court's description avoids a source of serious doubt by glossing over the practical problems its take on the statute portends. The Court is unmoved by the argument that Congress probably did not expect federal courts applying the ACCA to master the countless complications of state sentencing schemes; because all jurisdictions provide for enhanced sentencing some way or another, the Court thinks there is nothing threatening in the subject, which it tries to simplify by offering a few practical pointers. It notes that there will be cases with a qualifying enhancement \"evident from the length of the sentence imposed\" by the state court; sometimes, it says, a court's \"judgment of conviction will . . . list the maximum possible sentence\"; or the state prosecutor will have \"submit[ted] a formal charging document in order to obtain a recidivist enhancement.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1791. And in cases involving pleas, the Court notes, \"the plea colloquy will very often include a statement by the trial judge regarding the maximum penalty.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Even when there are no pointers to help, says the Court, and \"the records that may properly be consulted\" yield no clear answer, the worst that can happen will be the Government's inability to show that a prior conviction qualifies. <i>Ante,</i> at 1791.</p>\n<p>But it is not that easy, and the Court's pointers are not much comfort. To start with, even where a \"maximum\" sentence is mentioned in state records, how will the ACCA court be supposed to know that the \"maximum\" written down there is what the Court today holds that \"maximum\" means? A State's number below 10 years may refer to the base-level offense, or it may be the reduced maximum required by mandatory guidelines; and a number over 10 years may be the product of other enhancements (as for weapons use or being out on bail at the time of commission). Having to enquire into just what imposed sentences or what trial documents really <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1799</span> mean would seem to leave plenty of sorting out for the federal courts to do (or at least, for federal prosecutors, if they end up with the job).</p>\n<p>Another example: State laws are not written to coordinate with the ACCA, and if a State's specific repeat drug-offender provisions, say, are supposed to be read together with its general habitual-offender statutes, the resulting \"maximum\" may not be the Court's \"maximum.\" Indeed, a federal court may have to figure out just how those state statutes may be read together to avoid conflict between them, when the way to avoid conflict is not clear cut even for the state courts, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Goldberg v. State,</i> 282 Ga. 542, 651 S.E.2d 667 (2007) (general recidivist statute trumps more specific one; overruling same court's decision in <i>Mikell v. State,</i> 270 Ga. 467, 510 S.E.2d 523 (1999)); <i>State v. Keith,</i> 102 N.M. 462, 697 P.2d 145 (App.1985) (specific trumps general). Cf. <i>Clines v. State,</i> 912 So.2d 550 (Fla.2005) (relying on rule of lenity to resolve whether multiple recidivist categories in same habitual-offender law could apply to a single sentence).</p>\n<p>And there is more: as Rodriquez reminds us, just deciding what counts as a \"prior\" offense under state law is not always an easy thing. See <i>People v. Wiley,</i> 9 Cal.4th 580, 583, 38 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, 889 P.2d 541, 542 (1995) (noting difficulty of applying requirement that \"prior\" charges have been \"brought and tried separately,\" where defendant had been convicted in trials occurring one day apart and sentenced at the same court session; in the end, drawing the needed inference from docket numbers revealed on documents requested from the municipal trial court); <i>id.,</i> at 595, 38 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, 889 P.2d, at 550 (Werdegar, J., dissenting) (protesting the court's solicitation and use of extra-record documents). Nor would that sort of enquiry get any easier, or be more likely to benefit from well-settled state law, when a given State's law takes account of prior offenses in other States, see <i>Timothy v. State,</i> 90 P.3d 177 (Alaska App. 2004) (holding Oklahoma burglary not to be analogous to one in Alaska, for purposes of Alaska's recidivism enhancements, thus overruling its own 2-year-old decision, <i>Butts v. State,</i> 53 P.3d 609 (2002)); or, to take a specific example, when what qualifies a prior offense under one State's recidivism scheme is the length of the sentence authorized by another State's law (raising the question whether that first State would see recidivist enhancements the same way the Court does today). See, <i>e.g.,</i> N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:44-4(c) (West 2005) (\"A conviction in another jurisdiction shall constitute a prior conviction of a crime if a sentence of imprisonment in excess of 6 months was authorized under the law of the other jurisdiction\"); N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-18-17(D)(2)(b) (2007 Supp.) (defining \"prior felony conviction\" as, <i>inter alia,</i> a felony \"punishable [by] a maximum term of imprisonment of more than one year\").</p>\n<p>A still thornier problem is how federal courts are supposed to treat a State's procedural safeguards for using prior convictions at sentencing. Saying that congressional deference to the States' judgments about the severity of crimes also extends to their judgments about recidivism raises, but does not answer, the question whether such deference goes only as far as the state courts themselves could go in raising penalties. (The Court's disregard of mandatory sentencing guidelines would seem to suggest that the answer is no.) In those States that require notice before the prosecutor can seek a recidivism enhancement, for example, how will a federal court decide whether the ACCA counts a prior conviction that would have qualified for recidivism enhancement if the state prosecutor had not failed to give timely notice? <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1800</span> See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Commonwealth v. Fernandes,</i> 430 Mass. 517, 522, 722 N.E.2d 406, 409 (1999) (noting longstanding rule that the indictment must give notice of prior convictions \"that may subject the defendant to enhanced punishment\").</p>\n<p>I could go on, but this is enough to show that the Court's interpretation promises that ACCA courts will face highly complicated enquiries into every State's or Territory's collection of ancillary sentencing laws. That is an unconvincing answer to the ambiguity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, a plainly superior reading may well be elusive; one favoring the Government certainly is. It does not defy common English or common sense, after all, to look at a statute with one penalty range for the basic crime and a higher one for a repeat offender and say that the former sets the maximum penalty for the \"offense\"; but neither is it foolish to see the \"offense\" as defined by its penalty, however that is computed. What I have said so far suggests that I think the basic-crime view of \"offense\" is the better one, but I will concede that the competing positions are pretty close to evenly matched. And on that assumption, there is a ready tie-breaker.</p>\n<p>The interpretation adopted by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals is the one counseled by the rule of lenity, which applies where (as here) we have \"`seiz[ed] every thing from which aid can be derived,'\" but are \"left with an ambiguous statute,\" <i>United States v. Bass,</i> 404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) (quoting <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> 2 Cranch 358, 386, 2 L.Ed. 304 (1805) (opinion of the Court by Marshall, C. J.)). The rule is grounded in \"`the instinctive distaste against men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly said they should,'\" <i>Bass, supra,</i> at 348, 92 S.Ct. 515 (quoting H. Friendly, Benchmarks 209 (1967)), and we have used it to resolve questions both about metes and bounds of criminal conduct and about the severity of sentencing. See <i>Bifulco v. United States,</i> 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980) (collecting cases). \"This policy of lenity means that the Court will not interpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\" <i>Ladner v. United States,</i> 358 U.S. 169, 178, 79 S.Ct. 209, 3 L.Ed.2d 199 (1958).</p>\n<p>This is why lenity should control here. Even recognizing the best that can be said for the Government's side, its position rests on debatable guesswork to send a man to prison for 180 months, as against 92 months on the basic-crime view. And the District Courts will be imposing higher sentences more than doubling the length of the alternative in a good many other cases, as well.</p>\n<p>The \"fair warning\" that motivates the lenity rule, <i>McBoyle v. United States,</i> 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931) (opinion of the Court by Holmes, J.), may sometimes be a benign fiction, see <i>R.L.C.,</i> 503 U.S., at 309, 112 S.Ct. 1329 (SCALIA, J., concurring), but there is only one reading of this statute with any realistic chance of giving fair notice of how the ACCA will apply, and that is the reading the District Court and the Court of Appeals each chose. Their choice should be ours, too.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  \"Except as authorized by this chapter, it is unlawful for any person to manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance.\" Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401(a)(1994).</p>\n<p>[2]  In any event, the only \"minor drug crime\" that respondent identifies as potentially constituting an ACCA predicate based on recidivist enhancement is distribution of a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812, Schedule III narcotic in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 333.7401(2)(b)(ii) (West Supp.2007). Given that Schedule III substances include anabolic steroids and painkillers with specified amounts of certain narcotics like opium, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812, one might debate respondent's assertion that distribution of these narcotics is not \"serious\" in the generic sense of the word. However, Congress chose to defer to the Michigan Legislature's judgment that the offense was \"serious\" enough to warrant punishment of first offenses by up to seven years' imprisonment, and certain repeat offenses by a maximum term of life imprisonment.

See Frase, State Sentencing Guidelines: Diversity, Consensus, and Unresolved Policy Issues, 105 Colum. L.Rev. 1190, 1196, Table 1 (2005). Two of those States (Utah and Maryland) had voluntary guidelines, <i>id.,</i> at 1198, and the other six States had guidelines systems that allowed for sentences in excess of the recommended range in various circumstances, see <i>People v. Miles,</i> 156 Mich.App. 431, 437, 402 N.W.2d 34, 37 (1986) (remanding for the trial court to state reasons for upward departure); <i>Staats v. State,</i> 717 P.2d 413, 422 (Alaska App.1986) (affirming upward departure); <i>State v. Armstrong,</i> 106 Wash.2d 547, 549-550, 723 P.2d 1111, 1113-1114 (1986) (en banc) (same); <i>State v.

The Government seems to accept this possibility, noting that \"if a statute is as a formal matter structured in such a way as to create broad tiers of punishment for categories of offenders\" based on factors other than recidivism, \"then certainly that would seem to be an alternative maximum term of imprisonment.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 21. The Court, however, does not address this prospect, despite having seen the same kind of result as a dealbreaker for Rodriquez's view.</p>\n<p>[2]  Even adopting the \"alternative\" of accounting for an offender's circumstances and record does not resolve the ambiguity, for this rubric actually comprises multiple possibilities under its generic umbrella. Most simply, it might be thought to refer to the actual offender's sentencing range as applied by the state court. At the other extreme, it might mean the maximum for a purely hypothetical \"worst\" offender who incurs all possible add-ons. Or perhaps it means a fictional version of the actual offender, say, one qualifying for some statutory add-ons but not for any guidelines rules (as the Court would have it); or maybe one who qualifies for both the statutory and the guidelines departures for which the actual offender was eligible, even though not all of those departures were applied by the state court. This menagerie of options would be multiplied, if a court directly confronted the choice whether to count enhancements for offender-based factors other than recidivism, and if so, which.</p>\n<p>[3]  In this case, doing so would likely result in affirmance, because as the Government admits, Rodriquez's guidelines ceiling was just shy of five years.

RODRIQUEZ\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 06\u20131646. Argued January 15, 2008\u2014Decided May 19, 2008\nUpon respondent\u2019s federal conviction for possession of a firearm by a\n convicted felon, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1), he had three prior Washington\n state convictions for delivery of a controlled substance. At the time of\n those convictions, Washington law specified a maximum 5-year\n prison term for the first such offense. A recidivist provision, however,\n set a 10-year ceiling for a second or subsequent offense, and the state\n court had sentenced respondent to concurrent 48-month sentences on\n each count. The Government contended in the federal felon-in-\n possession case that respondent should be sentenced under the\n Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), \u00a7924(e), which sets a 15-year\n minimum sentence \u201c[i]n the case of a person who violates [\u00a7922(g)]\n and has three previous convictions . . . for a . . . serious drug offense,\u201d\n \u00a7924(e)(1). Because a state drug-trafficking conviction qualifies as \u201ca\n serious drug offense\u201d if \u201ca maximum term of imprisonment of ten\n years or more is prescribed by law\u201d for the \u201coffense,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(A)(ii),\n and the maximum term on at least two of respondent\u2019s Washington\n crimes was 10 years under the state recidivist provision, the Gov-\n ernment argued that these convictions had to be counted under\n ACCA. The District Court disagreed, holding that the \u201cmaximum\n term of imprisonment\u201d for \u00a7924(e)(2)(A)(ii) purposes is determined\n without reference to recidivist enhancements. The Ninth Circuit af-\n firmed.\nHeld: The \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law\u201d for\n the state drug convictions at issue was the 10-year maximum set by\n the applicable state recidivist provision. Pp. 3\u201314.\n    (a) This reading is compelled by a straightforward application of\n \u00a7924(e)(2)(A)(ii)\u2019s three key terms: \u201coffense,\u201d \u201claw,\u201d and \u201cmaximum\n term.\u201d The \u201coffense\u201d was the crime charged in each of respondent\u2019s\n2                   UNITED STATES v. RODRIQUEZ\n\n                                  Syllabus\n    drug-delivery cases. And because the relevant \u201claw\u201d is the state\n    statutes prescribing 5- and 10-year prison terms, the \u201cmaximum\n    term\u201d prescribed for at least two of respondent\u2019s state drug offenses\n    was 10 years. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the maximum term\n    was 5 years contorts ACCA\u2019s plain terms. Although the state court\n    sentenced respondent to 48 months, there is no dispute that state law\n    permitted a sentence of up to 10 years. The Circuit\u2019s interpretation\n    is also inconsistent with how the concept \u201cmaximum term of impris-\n    onment\u201d is customarily understood by participants in the criminal\n    justice process. Pp. 3\u20135.\n       (b) Respondent\u2019s textual argument\u2014that because \u201coffense\u201d gener-\n    ally describes a crime\u2019s elements, while prior convictions required for\n    recidivist enhancements are not typically elements, such convictions\n    are not part of the ACCA \u201coffense,\u201d and the \u201cmaximum term\u201d for the\n    convictions at issue was the 5-year ceiling for simply committing the\n    drug offense elements\u2014is not faithful to the statutory text, which re-\n    fers to the maximum 10-year term prescribed by Washington law for\n    each of respondent\u2019s two relevant offenses. Respondent\u2019s \u201cmanifest\n    purpose\u201d argument\u2014that because ACCA uses the maximum state-\n    law penalty as shorthand for conduct sufficiently serious to trigger\n    the mandatory penalty, while an offense\u2019s seriousness is typically\n    gauged by the nature of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the offense\u2019s ele-\n    ments, and the crime\u2019s impact, a defendant\u2019s recidivist status has no\n    connection to whether his offense was serious\u2014rests on the errone-\n    ous proposition that a prior record has no bearing on an offense\u2019s se-\n    riousness. Respondent\u2019s understanding of recidivism statutes has\n    been has squarely rejected. See, e.g., Nichols v. United States, 511\n    U. S. 738, 747. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (c) Respondent\u2019s argument that the Court\u2019s ACCA interpretation\n    produces a perverse bootstrapping whereby a defendant is punished\n    under federal law for being treated as a recidivist under state law is\n    rejected. The Court\u2019s reading is bolstered by the fact that ACCA is\n    itself a recidivist statute, so that Congress must have understood\n    that the \u201cmaximum penalty prescribed by [state] law\u201d could be in-\n    creased by state recidivism provisions. Contrary to respondent\u2019s sug-\n    gestion, United States v. LaBonte, 520 U. S. 751\u2014in which the Court\n    held that the phrase \u201cmaximum term authorized\u201d in 28 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7994(h) \u201crefers to all applicable statutes,\u201d including recidivist en-\n    hancements\u2014supports the Court\u2019s ACCA interpretation. Respon-\n    dent\u2019s reliance on Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, is also mis-\n    placed: There is no connection between the issue there (the meaning\n    of \u201cburglary\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)) and the meaning of \u201cmaximum term\n    of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(A)(ii). Respon-\n    dent argues unpersuasively that, under today\u2019s interpretation, of-\n    fenses that are not really serious will be included as \u201cserious drug of-\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n  fense[s]\u201d because of recidivist enhancements. Since Congress pre-\n  sumably thought that state lawmakers must consider a crime \u201cseri-\n  ous\u201d when they provide a 10-year sentence for it, this Court\u2019s holding\n  poses no risk that a drug-trafficking offense will be treated as \u201cseri-\n  ous\u201d without satisfying the standard Congress prescribed. Pp. 7\u20139.\n     (d) Also rejected is respondent\u2019s argument that the Court\u2019s holding\n  will often require federal courts to engage in difficult inquiries re-\n  garding novel state-law questions and complex factual determina-\n  tions about long-past state-court proceedings. Respondent greatly\n  exaggerates the difficulties because (1) receipt of a recidivist en-\n  hancement will necessarily be evident from the sentence\u2019s length in\n  some cases; (2) the conviction judgment will sometimes list the\n  maximum possible sentence even where the sentence actually im-\n  posed did not exceed the top sentence allowed without recidivist en-\n  hancement; (3) some jurisdictions require the prosecution to submit a\n  publicly available charging document to obtain a recidivist enhance-\n  ment; (4) a plea colloquy will often include a statement by the trial\n  judge regarding the maximum penalty; and (5) where the records do\n  not show that the defendant faced a recidivist enhancement, the\n  Government may well be precluded from establishing that a convic-\n  tion was for a qualifying offense. Merely because future cases might\n  present difficulties cannot justify disregarding ACCA\u2019s clear mean-\n  ing. Pp. 10\u201311.\n     (e) Also unavailing is respondent\u2019s argument that if recidivist en-\n  hancements can increase the \u201cmaximum term\u201d under ACCA, then\n  mandatory guidelines systems capping sentences can decrease the\n  \u201cmaximum term,\u201d whereas Congress cannot have wanted to make the\n  \u201cmaximum term\u201d dependent on the complexities of state sentencing\n  guidelines. The phrase \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment . . . pre-\n  scribed by law\u201d for the \u201coffense\u201d could not have been meant to apply\n  to the top sentence in a guidelines range because (1) such a sentence\n  is generally not really the maximum because guidelines systems\n  typically allow a sentencing judge to impose a sentence that exceeds\n  the top of the guidelines range under appropriate circumstances; and\n  (2) in all of the many statutes predating ACCA and the federal Sen-\n  tencing Reform Act of 1984 that used the concept of the \u201cmaximum\u201d\n  term prescribed by law, the concept necessarily referred to the maxi-\n  mum term prescribed by the relevant criminal statute, not the top of\n  a sentencing guideline range.

We reverse.\n                              I\n  At issue in this case is respondent\u2019s sentence on his\n2004 conviction in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Washington for possession of a firearm\nby a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U. S.

At the time\nof respondent\u2019s drug offenses, the Washington statute that\nrespondent was convicted of violating stated that, upon\nconviction, a defendant could be \u201cimprisoned for not more\nthan five years,\u201d \u00a7\u00a769.50.401(a)(1)(ii)\u2013(iv), but another\nprovision specified that \u201c[a]ny person convicted of a second\nor subsequent offense\u201d could \u201cbe imprisoned for a term up\nto twice the term otherwise authorized,\u201d \u00a769.50.408(a).\nThus, by virtue of this latter, recidivist, provision respon-\ndent faced a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10\nyears. The judgment of conviction for each of the drug-\ndelivery charges listed the maximum term of imprison-\nment for the offense as \u201cten years,\u201d App. 16, 42, 93, but the\nstate court sentenced respondent to concurrent sentences\nof 48 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count. Id., at 21, 47,\n98.\n    In the federal felon-in-possession case, the Government\nasked the District Court to sentence respondent under\nACCA, which sets a 15-year minimum sentence \u201c[i]n the\ncase of a person who violates section 922(g) of [Title 18]\nand has three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony\nor a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions\ndifferent from one another . . . .\u201d 18 U.

The\nDistrict Court agreed, and that ruling is not at issue here.\n    The Government also argued that at least two of re-\nspondent\u2019s Washington drug convictions were for \u201cserious\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nto manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to manufacture or \n\ndeliver a controlled substance.\u201d Wash.

The District Court disagreed, hold-\ning that respondent\u2019s drug-trafficking convictions were not\nconvictions for \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d under ACCA\nbecause the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d for the\npurposes of \u00a7924(e)(2)(A)(ii) is determined without refer-\nence to recidivist enhancements.

S.\n___ (2007).\n                            II\n  The question that we must decide is whether the\n\u201cmaximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\u201d in\nthis case is, as respondent maintains and the Ninth Cir-\n4              UNITED STATES v. RODRIQUEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncuit held, the 5-year ceiling for first offenses or, as the\nGovernment contends, the 10-year ceiling for second or\nsubsequent offenses. See Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a769.50.401(a)\n(ii)\u2013(iv), 69.50.408(a).\n   The Government\u2019s reading is compelled by the language\nof ACCA. For present purposes, there are three key statu-\ntory terms: \u201coffense,\u201d \u201claw,\u201d and \u201cmaximum term.\u201d The\n\u201coffense\u201d in each of the drug-delivery cases was a violation\nof \u00a7\u00a769.50.401(a)(ii)\u2013(iv). The relevant \u201claw\u201d is set out in\nboth that provision, which prescribes a \u201cmaximum term\u201d\nof five years for a first \u201coffense,\u201d and \u00a769.50.408(a), which\nprescribes a \u201cmaximum term\u201d of 10 years for a second or\nsubsequent \u201coffense.\u201d Thus, in this case, the maximum\nterm prescribed by Washington law for at least two of\nrespondent\u2019s state drug offenses was 10 years.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the maximum term\nwas five years contorts ACCA\u2019s plain terms. Although the\nWashington state court sentenced respondent to 48\nmonths\u2019 imprisonment, there is no dispute that\n\u00a769.50.408(a) permitted a sentence of up to 10 years. On\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading of ACCA, even if respondent\nhad been sentenced to, say, six years\u2019 imprisonment, \u201cthe\nmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d prescribed by law still\nwould have been five years. It is hard to accept the propo-\nsition that a defendant may lawfully be sentenced to a\nterm of imprisonment that exceeds the \u201cmaximum term of\nimprisonment . . . prescribed by law,\u201d but that is where the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s reading of the statute leads.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation is also inconsistent\nwith the way in which the concept of the \u201cmaximum term\nof imprisonment\u201d is customarily understood by partici-\npants in the criminal justice process. Suppose that a\ndefendant who indisputably had more than three prior\nconvictions for \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d or \u201cserious drug of-\nfense[s]\u201d was charged in federal court with violating the\nfelon-in-possession statute.

Suppose that the\ndefendant asked his or her attorney, \u201cWhat\u2019s the maxi-\nmum term I face for the new offense?\u201d An attorney aware\nof ACCA would surely not respond, \u201c10 years,\u201d even\nthough 10 years is the maximum sentence without the\nACCA enhancement. See \u00a7924(a)(2) (2000 ed.).\n   Suppose that the defendant then pleaded guilty to the\nfelon-in-possession charge. Under Federal Rule of Crimi-\nnal Procedure 11(b)(1)(H), the trial judge would be re-\nquired to advise the defendant of the \u201cmaximum possible\npenalty.\u201d If the judge told the defendant that the maxi-\nmum possible sentence was 10 years and then imposed a\nsentence of 15 years based on ACCA, the defendant would\nhave been sorely misled and would have a ground for\nmoving to withdraw the plea. See United States v. Gon-\nzalez, 420 F. 3d 111, 132 (CA2 2005); United States v.\nHarrington, 354 F. 3d 178, 185\u2013186 (CA2 2004). In sum, a\nstraightforward application of the language of ACCA leads\nto the conclusion that the \u201cmaximum term of imprison-\nment prescribed by law\u201d in this case was 10 years.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   In an effort to defend the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, re-\nspondent offers both a textual argument and a related\nargument based on the \u201cmanifest purpose\u201d of ACCA. Brief\nfor Respondent 8.\n   Respondent\u2019s textual argument is as follows. The term\n\u201coffense\u201d \u201cgenerally is understood to describe the elements\nconstituting the crime.\u201d Id., at 10. Because prior convic-\ntions required for recidivist enhancements are not typi-\ncally offense elements, they should not be considered part\nof the \u201coffense\u201d under ACCA. Thus, the \u201cmaximum term\nof imprisonment prescribed by law\u201d for the drug convic-\ntions at issue was the maximum term prescribed for sim-\n6              UNITED STATES v. RODRIQUEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nply committing the elements of the drug offense and was\ntherefore five years. Id., at 10\u201311.\n   Respondent\u2019s argument is not faithful to the statutory\ntext. Respondent reads ACCA as referring to \u201cthe maxi-\nmum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\u201d for a de-\nfendant with no prior convictions that trigger a recidivist\nenhancement, but that is not what ACCA says. ACCA\ninstead refers to \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment\nprescribed by law\u201d for \u201can offense,\u201d and, as previously\nexplained, in this case, the maximum term prescribed by\nWashington law for each of respondent\u2019s two relevant\noffenses was 10 years.\n   Respondent\u2019s argument based on ACCA\u2019s \u201cmanifest\npurpose\u201d must also be rejected. Respondent argues that\nACCA uses \u201cthe maximum penalty specified for the of-\nfense by state law as a short-hand means of identifying\nconduct deemed sufficiently \u2018serious\u2019 to trigger [the] man-\ndatory penalty.\u201d Id., at 9. According to respondent, \u201c[t]he\nnature of [a defendant\u2019s] conduct, the elements of the\noffense, and the impact of the crime . . . are the character-\nistics that typically are used to gauge the \u2018seriousness\u2019 of\nan offense,\u201d and a defendant\u2019s \u201cstatus as a recidivist has\nno connection to whether the offense committed by the\ndefendant was a \u2018serious\u2019 one.\u201d Id., at 11.\n   This argument rests on the erroneous proposition that a\ndefendant\u2019s prior record of convictions has no bearing on\nthe seriousness of an offense. On the contrary, however,\nan offense committed by a repeat offender is often thought\nto reflect greater culpability and thus to merit greater\npunishment. Similarly, a second or subsequent offense is\noften regarded as more serious because it portends greater\nfuture danger and therefore warrants an increased sen-\ntence for purposes of deterrence and incapacitation. See\nWitte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389, 403 (1995); Spencer\nv. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 570 (1967) (Warren, C. J., dissent-\ning in two judgments and concurring in one).\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   If respondent were correct that a defendant\u2019s record of\nprior convictions has no bearing on the seriousness of an\noffense, then it would follow that any increased punish-\nment imposed under a recidivist provision would not be\nbased on the offense of conviction but on something else\u2014\npresumably the defendant\u2019s prior crimes or the defen-\ndant\u2019s \u201cstatus as a recidivist,\u201d Brief for Respondent 11.\nBut we have squarely rejected this understanding of re-\ncidivism statutes. In Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S.\n738 (1994), we explained that \u201c \u2018[t]his Court consistently\nhas sustained repeat-offender laws as penalizing only the\nlast offense committed by the defendant.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 747\n(quoting Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U. S. 222, 232 (1980)\n(Powell, J., dissenting)). When a defendant is given a\nhigher sentence under a recidivism statute\u2014or for that\nmatter, when a sentencing judge, under a guidelines\nregime or a discretionary sentencing system, increases a\nsentence based on the defendant\u2019s criminal history\u2014100%\nof the punishment is for the offense of conviction. None is\nfor the prior convictions or the defendant\u2019s \u201cstatus as a\nrecidivist.\u201d The sentence \u201cis a stiffened penalty for the\nlatest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated\noffense because [it is] a repetitive one.\u201d Gryger v. Burke,\n334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948).\n                             B\n   Respondent argues that our interpretation of ACCA\nproduces \u201ca sort of perverse bootstrapping\u201d under which a\ndefendant is \u201cpunished under federal law for being treated\nas a recidivist under state law,\u201d Brief for Respondent 20\n(emphasis deleted), but the fact that ACCA is itself a\nrecidivist statute bolsters our reading. Since ACCA is a\nrecidivist statute, Congress must have had such provisions\nin mind and must have understood that the \u201cmaximum\npenalty prescribed by [state] law\u201d in some cases would be\nincreased by state recidivism provisions.\n   Contrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion, United States v.\n8              UNITED STATES v. RODRIQUEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nLaBonte, 520 U. S. 751 (1997), supports our interpretation\nof ACCA. The statute at issue in LaBonte, a provision of\nthe Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, as amended, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7994(h), directed the United States Sentencing\nCommission to \u201cassure\u201d that the Sentencing Guidelines\nspecify a prison sentence \u201cat or near the maximum term\nauthorized for categories of\u201d adult offenders who commit\ntheir third felony drug offense or violent crime. We held\nthat the phrase \u201cmaximum term authorized\u201d \u201crefers to all\napplicable statutes,\u201d including recidivist enhancements.\n520 U. S., at 758, n. 4.\n   Respondent claims that LaBonte supports his position\nbecause ACCA, unlike 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(h), does not refer\nto \u201ccategories of\u201d offenders. Respondent suggests that\nCongress\u2019 failure to include such language in ACCA means\nthat Congress intended to refer to a \u201cmaximum term\u201d that\ndoes not depend on whether a defendant falls into the\nfirst-time-offender or recidivist \u201ccategory.\u201d Respondent\ndoes not explain how 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(A) could have\neasily been reworded to mirror 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(h). But in\nany event, the language used in ACCA, for the reasons\nexplained above, is more than clear enough.\n   Respondent argues that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision is\nsupported by the so-called \u201ccategorical\u201d approach that we\nused in Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990), in\ndetermining which offenses qualify as \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d\nunder 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\nprovides that four enumerated crimes\u2014burglary, arson,\nextortion, and offenses involving the use of explosives\u2014\nare \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d for ACCA purposes. In Taylor, we\nheld that Congress intended for these crimes to have a\n\u201cuniform definition\u201d that was \u201cindependent of the labels\nemployed by the various States\u2019 criminal codes.\u201d Id., at\n592. According to respondent, \u201c[t]he categorical approach\nrests on the congressional intent\u2014reflected in the statu-\ntory language\u2014to focus the ACCA inquiry on the offense\n                      Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                      9\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nof conviction, rather than on collateral matters unrelated\nto the definition of the crime.\u201d Brief for Respondent 12.\n   We see no connection, however, between the issue in\nTaylor (the meaning of the term \u201cburglary\u201d in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)) and the issue here (the meaning of the\nphrase \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by\nlaw\u201d under \u00a7924(e)(2)(A)(ii)). Taylor held that the mean-\ning of \u201cburglary\u201d for purposes of ACCA does not depend on\nthe label attached by the law of a particular State, 495\nU. S., at 600\u2013601, but the \u201cmaximum penalty prescribed\nby law\u201d for a state offense necessarily depends on state\nlaw.\n   For a similar reason, we reject respondent\u2019s argument\nthat, under our interpretation, offenses that are not really\nserious will be included as \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d be-\ncause of recidivist enhancements. In \u00a7924(e)(2)(A)(ii),\nCongress chose to rely on the \u201cmaximum term of impris-\nonment . . . prescribed\u201d by state law as the measure of the\nseriousness of state offenses involving the manufacture,\ndistribution, or possession of illegal drugs. Congress\npresumably thought\u2014not without reason\u2014that if state\nlawmakers provide that a crime is punishable by 10 years\u2019\nimprisonment, the lawmakers must regard the crime as\n\u201cserious,\u201d and Congress chose to defer to the state law-\nmakers\u2019 judgment. Therefore, our interpretation poses no\nrisk that a drug-trafficking offense will be treated as a\n\u201cserious\u201d without satisfying the standard that Congress\nprescribed.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In any event, the only \u201cminor drug crime\u201d that respondent identifies\nas potentially constituting an ACCA predicate based on recidivist\nenhancement is distribution of a 21 U. S. C. \u00a7812, Schedule III narcotic\nin violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7333.7401(2)(b)(ii) (West Supp.\n2007). Given that Schedule III substances include anabolic steroids\nand painkillers with specified amounts of certain narcotics like opium,\nsee 21 U. S. C. \u00a7812, one might debate respondent\u2019s assertion that\ndistribution of these narcotics is not \u201cserious\u201d in the generic sense of the\n10                UNITED STATES v. RODRIQUEZ\n\n                         Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              C\n\n  Respondent argues that it will often be difficult to de-\ntermine whether a defendant faced the possibility of a\nrecidivist enhancement in connection with a past state\ndrug conviction and that therefore our interpretation of\nACCA will require the federal courts to \u201cengage in difficult\ninquiries regarding novel questions of state law and com-\nplex factual determinations about long-past proceedings in\nstate courts.\u201d Brief for Respondent 21. Respondent\ngreatly exaggerates the problems to which he refers.\n  First, in some cases, a defendant will have received a\nrecidivist enhancement, and this will necessarily be evi-\ndent from the length of the sentence imposed. Second, as\nthe present case illustrates, see App. 16, 42, 93, the judg-\nment of conviction will sometimes list the maximum pos-\nsible sentence even where the sentence that was imposed\ndid not exceed the top sentence allowed without any re-\ncidivist enhancement. Third, as respondent himself notes,\nsome jurisdictions require that the prosecution submit a\nformal charging document in order to obtain a recidivist\nenhancement. See Brief for Respondent 33. Such docu-\nments fall within the limited list of generally available\ndocuments that courts already consult for the purpose of\ndetermining if a past conviction qualifies as an ACCA\npredicate. See Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 20\n(2005). Fourth, in those cases in which the defendant\npleaded guilty to the state drug charges, the plea colloquy\nwill very often include a statement by the trial judge\nregarding the maximum penalty. This is mandated by\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(H), and many\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nword. However, Congress chose to defer to the Michigan Legislature\u2019s\n\njudgment that the offense was \u201cserious\u201d enough to warrant punishment \n\nof first offenses by up to seven years\u2019 imprisonment, and certain repeat\n\noffenses by a maximum term of life imprisonment. See Mich. Comp. \n\nLaws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7333.7401(2)(b)(ii), 333.769.12(1). \n\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nStates have similar requirements.3 Finally, in those cases\nin which the records that may properly be consulted do not\nshow that the defendant faced the possibility of a recidi-\nvist enhancement, it may well be that the Government\nwill be precluded from establishing that a conviction was\nfor a qualifying offense. The mere possibility that some\nfuture cases might present difficulties cannot justify a\nreading of ACCA that disregards the clear meaning of the\nstatutory language.\n                             D\n  Respondent\u2019s last argument is that if recidivist en-\nhancements can increase the \u201cmaximum term\u201d of impris-\nonment under ACCA, it must follow that mandatory\nguidelines systems that cap sentences can decrease the\n\u201cmaximum term\u201d of imprisonment. Brief for Respondent\n38. In each situation, respondent argues, the \u201cmaximum\nterm\u201d of imprisonment is the term to which the state court\ncould actually have sentenced the defendant. Respondent\nconcedes that he has waived this argument with respect to\nhis own specific state-court convictions. See Brief in Op-\nposition 15, n. 7. He argues, however, that Congress\ncannot have wanted to make the \u201cmaximum term\u201d of\nimprisonment for ACCA purposes dependent on the com-\nplexities of state sentencing guidelines. We conclude,\nhowever, that the phrase \u201cmaximum term of imprison-\nment . . . prescribed by law\u201d for the \u201coffense\u201d was not\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See, e.g., Kan.

RODRIQUEZ\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmeant to apply to the top sentence in a guidelines range.\n  First, the top sentence in a guidelines range is generally\nnot really the \u201cmaximum term . . . prescribed by law\u201d for\nthe \u201coffense\u201d because guidelines systems typically allow a\nsentencing judge to impose a sentence that exceeds the top\nof the guidelines range under appropriate circumstances.\nThe United States Sentencing Guidelines, for example,\npermit \u201cupward departures,\u201d see United States Sentenc-\ning Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a75K2.0 (Nov. 2007),\nand essentially the same characteristic was shared by all\nof the mandatory guidelines system in existence at the\ntime of the enactment of the ACCA provision at issue in\nthis case.4 (Following this pattern, Washington law like-\nwise provided at the time of respondent\u2019s state convictions\nthat a sentencing judge could \u201cimpose a sentence outside\nthe standard sentence range\u201d upon a finding \u201cthat there\n[were] substantial and compelling reasons justifying an\nexceptional sentence.\u201d Wash.

L. 99\u2013570, \u00a71402, 100 Stat. 3207\u201339, eight States had guidelines\nsystems in effect. See Frase, State Sentencing Guidelines: Diversity,\nConsensus, and Unresolved Policy Issues, 105 Colum. L. Rev. 1190,\n1196, Table 1 (2005). Two of those States (Utah and Maryland) had\nvoluntary guidelines, id., at 1198, and the other six States had guide-\nlines systems that allowed for sentences in excess of the recommended\nrange in various circumstances, see People v.

S. ____ (2008)       13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Second, the concept of the \u201cmaximum\u201d term of impris-\nonment or sentence prescribed by law was used in many\nstatutes that predated the enactment of ACCA and the\nfederal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98\u2013473,\n\u00a7211, 98 Stat. 1987, and in all those statutes the concept\nnecessarily referred to the maximum term prescribed by\nthe relevant criminal statute, not the top of a sentencing\nguideline range. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a73 (1982 ed.) (\u201c[A]n\naccessory after the fact shall be imprisoned not more than\none-half the maximum term of imprisonment . . . for the\npunishment of the principal\u201d); \u00a73575(b) (allowing for an\nincreased sentence for dangerous special offenders \u201cnot\ndisproportionate in severity to the maximum term other-\nwise authorized by law for\u201d the underlying felony); see also\n\u00a7371 (the punishment for conspiracy to commit a misde-\nmeanor \u201cshall not exceed the maximum punishment pro-\nvided for such misdemeanor\u201d); \u00a73651 (allowing for con-\nfinement and suspension of sentence upon conviction of an\noffense not punishable by death or life imprisonment \u201cif\nthe maximum sentence for such offense is more than six\nmonths\u201d); \u00a73653 (referring to the \u201cmaximum probation\nperiod\u201d).\n   It is instructive that, even in the Sentencing Reform\nAct, the concept of the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d\nprescribed for an offense was used in this sense. See \u00a7212,\n98 Stat. 1991\u20131992 (new 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559 classifying\noffenses based on \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment\nauthorized . . . by the statute describing the offense\u201d);\n\u00a7235(b)(1)(F), 98 Stat. 2032 (\u201cThe maximum term of im-\nprisonment in effect on the effective date [of the Sentenc-\ning Reform Act]\u201d remains in effect for five years after the\neffective date \u201cfor an offense committed before the effec-\ntive date\u201d); \u00a71003(a), id., at 2138 (solicitation to commit a\ncrime of violence punishable by \u201cone-half the maximum\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nother potential reasons for departing. \u00a79.94A.390. \n\n14              UNITED STATES v. RODRIQUEZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nterm of imprisonment . . . prescribed for the punishment of\nthe crime solicited\u201d). In light of this established pattern\nand the relative newness of sentencing guidelines systems\nwhen the ACCA provision at issue here was added, we\nconclude that Congress meant for the concept of the\n\u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d prescribed by law for\nan \u201coffense\u201d to have same meaning in ACCA.\n  Our decision in United States v. R. L. C., 503 U. S. 291\n(1992), is not to the contrary. The statutory provision\nthere, 18 U. S. C. \u00a75037(c) (2000 ed.), set out the term of\nofficial detention for a juvenile found to be a delinquent.\nThis provision was amended by the Sentencing Reform\nAct, see \u00a7214, 98 Stat. 2013, and then amended again two\nyears later, see \u00a7\u00a721(a)(2)\u2013(4), 100 Stat. 3596.

S. C. \u00a7924(e) (2000 ed. and\nSupp. V), over another that would make at least as much\nsense of the statute\u2019s ambiguous text and would follow the\ncounsel of a tradition of lenity in construing perplexing\ncriminal laws. The Court\u2019s choice, moreover, promises\nhard times for the trial courts that will have to make the\ncomplex sentencing calculations this decision demands. I\nrespectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  The ACCA mandates a 15-year minimum sentence for\nanyone convicted of violating \u00a7922(g) (2000 ed.) who \u201chas\nthree previous convictions [for] a serious drug offense\u201d\namong his prior crimes. \u00a7924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).\nSection 924(e)(2)(A) (2000 ed.) defines \u201cserious drug of-\nfense\u201d as an offense under state or federal drug laws, \u201cfor\nwhich a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or\nmore is prescribed by law.\u201d This limitation leaves open\nthe question whether a given conviction qualifies as \u201cseri-\nous\u201d by reference to the penalty for the acts making up the\nbasic offense, regardless of who commits it, or whether\naccount must also be taken of further facts (such as an\noffender\u2019s criminal record that qualified him for an en-\n2              UNITED STATES v. RODRIQUEZ\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nhanced penalty at the time of that earlier conviction). If\nthe first alternative is the reading Congress intended, a\nsentencing judge needs to look only to the penalty speci-\nfied for the basic offense committed by a first-time\noffender. But if the second is the intended one, a judge\nmay have to consider sentencing variations (for using a\ngun, say, or for repeating the offense) set out in other\nprovisions.\n   It all turns on the meaning of the word \u201coffense,\u201d to\nwhich the \u201cmaximum term\u201d is tied. One can naturally\nread \u201can offense\u201d at a general level as synonymous with \u201ca\ncrime,\u201d which would tend to rule out reference to maxi-\nmums adjusted for other facts; we do not usually speak of\na crime of \u201cburglary while having a criminal record and\nwhile out on bail.\u201d Those details would come up only if we\nwere speaking about a specific instance, described as a\nburglary \u201ccommitted by someone with a record while out\non bail,\u201d in which case the other facts may \u201cenhance\u201d his\nsentence beyond what would have been the maximum\nterm for burglary. The trouble is that \u201coffense\u201d could\neasily refer to a specific occurrence, too; looking at it that\nway would make it less jarring to suggest that the circum-\nstances around an event that authorize higher penalty\nranges (such as the use of a gun) or the defendant\u2019s history\n(like a prior conviction) ought to count in identifying the\nmaximum penalty for the offense committed on the given\nday, at the given place, by the particular offender, in a\ngiven way. Either reading seems to offer a plausible take\non the \u201coffense\u201d for which the ACCA court will have to\nidentify or calculate \u201cmaximum\u201d penalties, under state\nlaw.\n   We get no help from imagining the circumstances in\nwhich a sentencing court would ask which reading to\nadopt. The choice of answer would be easy if the question\narose in the mind of a lawyer whose client is thinking\nabout a guilty plea and asks what maximum term he\n                    Cite as: 553 U.

When a repeat\noffender wants to know, counsel understands that the\npenalty prescribed for the basic crime without the recidi-\nvist add-on is not the baseline for comparison that may\nmake or break the potential plea agreement. And if the\nrepeat offender faces a further statutory enhancement for\ncarrying a gun during the offense, or for being out on bail,\nhis lawyer would not tell him the maximum term for\nrepeat offenders without guns or bail restrictions. By the\nsame token, if the offender faced (as Rodriquez did) a\nlower sentence ceiling than what the statute says, by\ngrace of mandatory sentencing guidelines, his lawyer\nwould know enough to tell him that his maximum was\ncapped in this way.\n  When the issue comes up not in a particular client\u2019s\nquestions about his own prospects, however, but in a trial\njudge\u2019s mind wondering about the meaning of the general\nstatute, context gives no ready answer. Nor does it break\nthe tie to say, as the Court does, that taking \u201cmaximum\u201d\nto refer to the basic offense would mean that a recidivist\nwith add-ons could be sentenced above the ACCA \u201cmaxi-\nmum,\u201d see ante, at 4 (\u201ceven if respondent had been sen-\ntenced to, say, six years\u2019 imprisonment, \u2018the maximum\nterm of imprisonment\u2019 prescribed by law still would have\nbeen five years\u201d). That description, after all, might be just\na verbal quirk showing the statutory design in proper\nworking order: if Congress meant an offense to be viewed\ngenerically and apart from offender characteristics, a gap\nbetween the maximum for ACCA purposes, and a heavier,\nactual sentence accounting for a defendant\u2019s history is to\nbe expected.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Indeed, if today\u2019s decision is read to mean that enhancements only\n\nfor recidivism need to be counted, then it too permits a defendant\u2019s\nactual sentence for a predicate conviction to be higher than what a\n4                 UNITED STATES v. RODRIQUEZ\n\n                         SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\n  The text does not point to any likelier interpretive\nchoices, and as between these alternatives, it is simply\nambiguous.2 Because I do not believe its ambiguity is\nfairly resolved in the Government\u2019s favor, I would affirm.\n                            II \n\n                            A\n\n  None of the Court\u2019s three principal points or ripostes\nsolves the puzzle. To begin with, there is something arbi-\ntrary about trying to resolve the ambiguity by rejecting\nthe maximum-for-basic-offense option while declining to\nconsider an entire class of offender-based sentencing\nadjustments. If offender characteristics are going to count\nin identifying the relevant maximum penalty, it would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfederal court identifies as an offense\u2019s \u201cmaximum term\u201d for ACCA\npurposes: actual sentences can outstrip the maximum term for recidi-\nvists if nonrecidivism factors such as weapons enhancements can also\nraise a given defendant\u2019s statutory ceiling. The Government seems to\naccept this possibility, noting that \u201cif a statute is as a formal matter\nstructured in such a way as to create broad tiers of punishment for\ncategories of offenders\u201d based on factors other than recidivism, \u201cthen\ncertainly that would seem to be an alternative maximum term of\nimprisonment.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 21. The Court, however, does not\naddress this prospect, despite having seen the same kind of result as a\ndealbreaker for Rodriquez\u2019s view.\n  2 Even adopting the \u201calternative\u201d of accounting for an offender\u2019s cir-\n\ncumstances and record does not resolve the ambiguity, for this rubric\nactually comprises multiple possibilities under its generic umbrella.\nMost simply, it might be thought to refer to the actual offender\u2019s\nsentencing range as applied by the state court. At the other extreme, it\nmight mean the maximum for a purely hypothetical \u201cworst\u201d offender\nwho incurs all possible add-ons. Or perhaps it means a fictional version\nof the actual offender, say, one qualifying for some statutory add-ons\nbut not for any guidelines rules (as the Court would have it); or maybe\none who qualifies for both the statutory and the guidelines departures\nfor which the actual offender was eligible, even though not all of those\ndepartures were applied by the state court. This menagerie of options\nwould be multiplied, if a court directly confronted the choice whether to\ncount enhancements for offender-based factors other than recidivism,\nand if so, which.\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nseem to follow that in jurisdictions with mandatory sen-\ntencing guidelines, the maximum \u201cprescribed by law\u201d\nwould be what the guidelines determine. The original\nFederal Guidelines, and the mandatory state guidelines I\nam aware of, were established under statutory authority\nthat invests a guideline with the same legal status as a\ncustomary penalty provision. Cf. United States v. R. L. C.,\n503 U. S. 291, 297 (1992) (\u201cThe answer to any suggestion\nthat the statutory character of a specific penalty provi-\nsion gives it primacy over administrative sentencing\nguidelines is that the mandate to apply the Guidelines is\nitself statutory\u201d).\n   The Court tries to deflect the implication of its position\nby denying that state sentencing guidelines really do set\nmaximum penalties, since typically they allow a judge to\ndepart from them, up or down, when specified conditions\nare met. See ante, at 12. But while this is true, the objec-\ntion stands. However a particular mandatory guideline\nscheme works, it sets a maximum somewhere; if it in-\ncludes conditions affecting what would otherwise be a\nguideline maximum, the top of the range as affected\nshould be the relevant maximum on the Court\u2019s reading of\nthe statute. Indeed, the factual conditions involved are\nusually offender characteristics, and if the ACCA is going\nto count them under offense-defining statutes or free-\nstanding recidivism laws, those same facts ought to count\nunder a guideline rule (whether setting, or authorizing a\ndeparture from, a particular limit). There is no practical\ndifference whether maximums are adjusted by a statute, a\nstatutorily mandated guideline, or a guideline-specified\ndeparture; wherever a \u201cprescri[ption] by law\u201d resides, it\nought to be honored by the ACCA court.\n   If we were to follow the Court\u2019s lights, then, I think we\nwould have to accept the complication that guidelines\nschemes present, and face the difficulty of calculating\n6                 UNITED STATES v. RODRIQUEZ\n\n                         SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nenhanced maximums in guidelines jurisdictions.3 What\nwe cannot do is to resolve statutory ambiguity by looking\nto the sentencing range for an imaginary offender who\nmeets statutory conditions for altering the basic sentence,\nbut is artificially stripped of any characteristic that trig-\ngers a guideline rule also \u201cprescribed by law.\u201d\n                             B\n   The more fundamental objection, though, goes to the\nCourt\u2019s basic conclusion that it makes the better sense to\nread the ACCA as resting the federal treatment of recidi-\nvists on the maximum sentence authorized by state recidi-\nvist schemes, in cases where state law must be considered.\nThe Court says it would have been natural for Congress to\nthink in terms of state judgments about repeat criminals\nwhen thinking about what to do at the national level, and\nthe Court is quite possibly right about this; the fact that\nthe federal penalty may turn on a state felony classifica-\ntion at all shows that Congress was thinking about state\nlaw. But the chances are at least equally good that the\nCourt is wrong; it is odd to think that Congress would\nhave piggybacked the federal system on state repeat-\noffender schemes, given the extraordinary and irreconcil-\nable variations among state policies on the subject.\n   For one thing, the States\u2019 recidivism schemes vary in\ntheir methods for augmenting sentences. Iowa\u2019s law, for\nexample, subjects repeat drug offenders to triple penalties,\nIowa Code \u00a7124.411(1) (2005); but in Wisconsin a repeat\ndrug distributor will see his maximum term increased by\na fixed number of years, whatever the starting point,\nsee, e.g., Wis. Stat. \u00a7961.48(1)(b) (2003\u20132004) (4-year in-\ncrease for Class H felony such as selling 1 kilogram of\nmarijuana).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 In this case, doing so would likely result in affirmance, because as\n\nthe Government admits, Rodriquez\u2019s guidelines ceiling was just shy of\nfive years.

Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 94C, \u00a732C(b) (West\n2006). In Delaware, a third conviction means a manda-\ntory sentence of life in prison without parole.

That Congress\nmight have chosen to defer to state-law judgments about\n\u201cseriousness\u201d that vary so widely for the same conduct is\nat least open to doubt. And that doubt only gets worse\nwhen we notice that even where two States have similar\nmaximum penalties for a base-level offense, their recidi-\nvist enhancements may lead the same conduct to trigger\nthe ACCA sanction in one State but not the other: on the\nCourt\u2019s view, an offender\u2019s second conviction for selling,\nsay, just over two pounds of marijuana will qualify as an\nACCA predicate crime if the conviction occurred in Ari-\nzona (maximum of 13 years), Iowa (15 years), Utah (15\nyears), and the District of Columbia (10 years), for exam-\nple;4 but it will fall short of the mark in California (8\nyears), Michigan (8 years), and New York (8 years).5 Yet\nin each of these States, the base-level offense has a maxi-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See Ariz.

To start with, even where a \u201cmaximum\u201d\nsentence is mentioned in state records, how will the ACCA\ncourt be supposed to know that the \u201cmaximum\u201d written\ndown there is what the Court today holds that \u201cmaximum\u201d\nmeans? A State\u2019s number below 10 years may refer to the\nbase-level offense, or it may be the reduced maximum\nrequired by mandatory guidelines; and a number over 10\nyears may be the product of other enhancements (as for\nweapons use or being out on bail at the time of commis-\nsion). Having to enquire into just what imposed sentences\nor what trial documents really mean would seem to leave\nplenty of sorting out for the federal courts to do (or at\nleast, for federal prosecutors, if they end up with the job).\n   Another example: State laws are not written to coordi-\nnate with the ACCA, and if a State\u2019s specific repeat drug-\noffender provisions, say, are supposed to be read together\nwith its general habitual-offender statutes, the resulting\n\u201cmaximum\u201d may not be the Court\u2019s \u201cmaximum.\u201d Indeed, a\nfederal court may have to figure out just how those state\nstatutes may be read together to avoid conflict between\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

State, 282 Ga.\n542, 651 S. E. 2d 667 (2007) (general recidivist statute\ntrumps more specific one; overruling same court\u2019s decision\nin Mikell v. State, 270 Ga. 467, 510 S. E. 2d 523 (1999));\nState v. Keith, 102 N. M. 462, 697 P. 2d 145 (App. 1985)\n(specific trumps general). Cf. Clines v. State, 912 So. 2d\n550 (Fla. 2005) (relying on rule of lenity to resolve whether\nmultiple recidivist categories in same habitual-offender\nlaw could apply to a single sentence).\n   And there is more: as Rodriquez reminds us, just decid-\ning what counts as a \u201cprior\u201d offense under state law is not\nalways an easy thing. See People v. Wiley, 9 Cal. 4th 580,\n583, 889 P. 2d 541, 542 (1995) (noting difficulty of apply-\ning requirement that \u201cprior\u201d charges have been \u201cbrought\nand tried separately,\u201d where defendant had been convicted\nin trials occurring one day apart and sentenced at the\nsame court session; in the end, drawing the needed infer-\nence from docket numbers revealed on documents re-\nquested from the municipal trial court); id., at 595, 889\nP. 2d, at 550 (Werdegar, J., dissenting) (protesting the\ncourt\u2019s solicitation and use of extra-record documents).\nNor would that sort of enquiry get any easier, or be more\nlikely to benefit from well-settled state law, when a given\nState\u2019s law takes account of prior offenses in other States,\nsee Timothy v. State, 90 P. 3d 177 (Alaska App. 2004)\n(holding Oklahoma burglary not to be analogous to one in\nAlaska, for purposes of Alaska\u2019s recidivism enhancements,\nthus overruling its own 2-year-old decision, Butts v. State,\n53 P. 3d 609 (2002)); or, to take a specific example, when\nwhat qualifies a prior offense under one State\u2019s recidivism\nscheme is the length of the sentence authorized by another\nState\u2019s law (raising the question whether that first State\nwould see recidivist enhancements the same way the\nCourt does today). See, e.g., N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a72C:44\u20134(c)\n(West 2005) (\u201cA conviction in another jurisdiction shall\n12             UNITED STATES v. RODRIQUEZ\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nconstitute a prior conviction of a crime if a sentence of\nimprisonment in excess of 6 months was authorized under\nthe law of the other jurisdiction\u201d); N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a731\u2013\n18\u201317(D)(2)(b) (2007 Supp.) (defining \u201cprior felony convic-\ntion\u201d as, inter alia, a felony \u201cpunishable [by] a maximum\nterm of imprisonment of more than one year\u201d).\n   A still thornier problem is how federal courts are sup-\nposed to treat a State\u2019s procedural safeguards for using\nprior convictions at sentencing. Saying that congressional\ndeference to the States\u2019 judgments about the severity of\ncrimes also extends to their judgments about recidivism\nraises, but does not answer, the question whether such\ndeference goes only as far as the state courts themselves\ncould go in raising penalties. (The Court\u2019s disregard of\nmandatory sentencing guidelines would seem to suggest\nthat the answer is no.) In those States that require notice\nbefore the prosecutor can seek a recidivism enhancement,\nfor example, how will a federal court decide whether the\nACCA counts a prior conviction that would have qualified\nfor recidivism enhancement if the state prosecutor had not\nfailed to give timely notice? See, e.g., Commonwealth v.\nFernandes, 430 Mass. 517, 522, 722 N. E. 2d 406, 409\n(1999) (noting longstanding rule that the indictment must\ngive notice of prior convictions \u201cthat may subject the de-\nfendant to enhanced punishment\u201d).\n   I could go on, but this is enough to show that the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation promises that ACCA courts will face highly\ncomplicated enquiries into every State\u2019s or Territory\u2019s\ncollection of ancillary sentencing laws. That is an uncon-\nvincing answer to the ambiguity.\n                            III\n  At the end of the day, a plainly superior reading may\nwell be elusive; one favoring the Government certainly is.\nIt does not defy common English or common sense, after\nall, to look at a statute with one penalty range for the\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

What I\nhave said so far suggests that I think the basic-crime view\nof \u201coffense\u201d is the better one, but I will concede that the\ncompeting positions are pretty close to evenly matched.\nAnd on that assumption, there is a ready tie-breaker.\n   The interpretation adopted by both the District Court\nand the Court of Appeals is the one counseled by the rule\nof lenity, which applies where (as here) we have \u201c \u2018 seiz[ed]\nevery thing from which aid can be derived,\u2019 \u201d but are \u201cleft\nwith an ambiguous statute,\u201d United States v.

United States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980) (collect-\ning cases). \u201cThis policy of lenity means that the Court will\nnot interpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase\nthe penalty that it places on an individual when such an\ninterpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to\nwhat Congress intended.\u201d Ladner v. United States, 358\nU. S. 169, 178 (1958).\n   This is why lenity should control here. Even recognizing\nthe best that can be said for the Government\u2019s side, its\nposition rests on debatable guesswork to send a man to\nprison for 180 months, as against 92 months on the basic-\ncrime view. And the District Courts will be imposing\nhigher sentences more than doubling the length of the\nalternative in a good many other cases, as well.\n   The \u201cfair warning\u201d that motivates the lenity rule,\n14             UNITED STATES v.

We reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>At issue in this case is respondent's sentence on his 2004 conviction in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Respondent had two prior state convictions in California for residential burglary and three state convictions in Washington for delivery of a controlled substance, in violation of Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(1)(ii)-(iv) (1994).<sup>[1]</sup> Respondent's three Washington drug convictions occurred on the same day but were based on deliveries that took place on three separate dates. Sentencing Order No. CR-03-142-RHW (ED Wash., Sept. 3, 2004), p. 5, App. 245, 250 (hereinafter Sentencing Order). At the time of respondent's drug offenses, the Washington statute that respondent was convicted of violating stated that, upon conviction, a defendant could be \"imprisoned for not more than five years,\" \u00a7\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(1)(ii)-(iv), but another provision specified that \"[a]ny person convicted of a second or subsequent offense\" could \"be imprisoned for a term up to twice the term otherwise authorized,\" \u00a7 69.50.408(a). Thus, by virtue of this latter, recidivist, provision respondent faced a maximum penalty of imprisonment for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1787</span> 10 years. The judgment of conviction for each of the drug-delivery charges listed the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense as \"ten years,\" App. 16, 42, 93, but the state court sentenced respondent to concurrent sentences of 48 months' imprisonment on each count. <i>Id.,</i> at 21, 47, 98.</p>\n<p>In the federal felon-in-possession case, the Government asked the District Court to sentence respondent under ACCA, which sets a 15-year minimum sentence \"[i]n the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of [Title 18] and has three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another . . . .\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The Government argued that respondent's two prior California burglary convictions were for \"`violent felonies.'\" Pet. for Cert. 4. See \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2000 ed.) (listing \"burglary\" as a \"violent felony\"). The District Court agreed, and that ruling is not at issue here.</p>\n<p>The Government also argued that at least two of respondent's Washington drug convictions were for \"serious drug offense[s].\" Under ACCA, a \"serious drug offense\" includes:</p>\n<blockquote>\"an offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to distribute, a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)), <i>for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.</i>\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>Because the maximum term that respondent faced on at least two of the Washington charges was 10 years, the Government contended that these convictions had to be counted under ACCA. The District Court disagreed, holding that respondent's drug-trafficking convictions were not convictions for \"serious drug offense[s]\" under ACCA because the \"maximum term of imprisonment\" for the purposes of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) is determined without reference to recidivist enhancements.

We granted the Government's petition for a writ of certiorari, 551 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 33, 168 L.Ed.2d 808 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The question that we must decide is whether the \"maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\" in this case is, as respondent maintains and the Ninth Circuit held, the 5-year ceiling for first offenses or, as the Government contends, the 10-year ceiling for second or subsequent offenses. See Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(ii)-(iv), 69.50.408(a).</p>\n<p>The Government's reading is compelled by the language of ACCA. For present purposes, there are three key statutory terms: \"offense,\" \"law,\" and \"maximum term.\" The \"offense\" in each of the drug-delivery cases was a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(ii)-(iv). The relevant \"law\" is set out in both that provision, which prescribes a \"maximum term\" of five years for a first \"offense,\" and \u00a7 69.50.408(a), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1788</span> which prescribes a \"maximum term\" of 10 years for a second or subsequent \"offense.\" Thus, in this case, the maximum term prescribed by Washington law for at least two of respondent's state drug offenses was 10 years.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit's holding that the maximum term was five years contorts ACCA's plain terms. Although the Washington state court sentenced respondent to 48 months' imprisonment, there is no dispute that \u00a7 69.50.408(a) permitted a sentence of up to 10 years. On the Ninth Circuit's reading of ACCA, even if respondent had been sentenced to, say, six years' imprisonment, \"the maximum term of imprisonment\" prescribed by law still would have been five years. It is hard to accept the proposition that a defendant may lawfully be sentenced to a term of imprisonment that exceeds the \"maximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law,\" but that is where the Ninth Circuit's reading of the statute leads.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit's interpretation is also inconsistent with the way in which the concept of the \"maximum term of imprisonment\" is customarily understood by participants in the criminal justice process. Suppose that a defendant who indisputably had more than three prior convictions for \"violent felon[ies]\" or \"serious drug of-fense[s]\" was charged in federal court with violating the felon-in-possession statute. Under ACCA, this defendant would face a sentence of \"not less than 15 years.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Suppose that the defendant asked his or her attorney, \"What's the maximum term I face for the new offense?\" An attorney aware of ACCA would surely not respond, \"10 years,\" even though 10 years is the maximum sentence without the ACCA enhancement. See \u00a7 924(a)(2) (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p>Suppose that the defendant then pleaded guilty to the felon-in-possession charge. Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(H), the trial judge would be required to advise the defendant of the \"maximum possible penalty.\" If the judge told the defendant that the maximum possible sentence was 10 years and then imposed a sentence of 15 years based on ACCA, the defendant would have been sorely misled and would have a ground for moving to withdraw the plea. See <i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791571\"><a href=\"/opinion/791571/united-states-v-manuel-gonzalez-also-known-as-luis/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 132 (C.A.2 2005); <i>United States v.

In sum, a straightforward application of the language of ACCA leads to the conclusion that the \"maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\" in this case was 10 years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In an effort to defend the Ninth Circuit's decision, respondent offers both a textual argument and a related argument based on the \"manifest purpose\" of ACCA. Brief for Respondent 8.</p>\n<p>Respondent's textual argument is as follows. The term \"offense\" \"generally is understood to describe the elements constituting the crime.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 10. Because prior convictions required for recidivist enhancements are not typically offense elements, they should not be considered part of the \"offense\" under ACCA. Thus, the \"maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\" for the drug convictions at issue was the maximum term prescribed for simply committing the elements of the drug offense and was therefore five years. <i>Id.,</i> at 10-11.</p>\n<p>Respondent's argument is not faithful to the statutory text. Respondent reads ACCA as referring to \"the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\" for a defendant <i>with no prior convictions that</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1789</span> <i>trigger a recidivist enhancement,</i> but that is not what ACCA says. ACCA instead refers to \"the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\" for \"an offense,\" and, as previously explained, in this case, the maximum term prescribed by Washington law for each of respondent's two relevant offenses was 10 years.</p>\n<p>Respondent's argument based on ACCA's \"manifest purpose\" must also be rejected. Respondent argues that ACCA uses \"the maximum penalty specified for the offense by state law as a short-hand means of identifying conduct deemed sufficiently `serious' to trigger [the] mandatory penalty.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 9. According to respondent, \"[t]he nature of [a defendant's] conduct, the elements of the offense, and the impact of the crime . . . are the characteristics that typically are used to gauge the `seriousness' of an offense,\" and a defendant's \"status as a recidivist has no connection to whether the offense committed by the defendant was a `serious' one.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 11.</p>\n<p>This argument rests on the erroneous proposition that a defendant's prior record of convictions has no bearing on the seriousness of an offense. On the contrary, however, an offense committed by a repeat offender is often thought to reflect greater culpability and thus to merit greater punishment. Similarly, a second or subsequent offense is often regarded as more serious because it portends greater future danger and therefore warrants an increased sentence for purposes of deterrence and incapacitation. See <i>Witte v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117954\"><a href=\"/opinion/117954/witte-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 403, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995); <i>Spencer v.

J., dissenting in two judgments and concurring in one).</p>\n<p>If respondent were correct that a defendant's record of prior convictions has no bearing on the seriousness of an offense, then it would follow that any increased punishment imposed under a recidivist provision would not be based on the offense of conviction but on something else\u0097 presumably the defendant's prior crimes or the defendant's \"status as a recidivist,\" Brief for Respondent 11. But we have squarely rejected this understanding of recidivism statutes. In <i>Nichols v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087959\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087959/nichols-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994), we explained that \"`[t]his Court consistently has sustained repeat-offender laws as penalizing only the last offense committed by the defendant.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 747, 114 S.Ct. 1921 (quoting <i>Baldasar v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110249\"><a href=\"/opinion/110249/baldasar-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span>, 232, 100 S.Ct. 1585, 64 L.Ed.2d 169 (1980) (Powell, J., dissenting)). When a defendant is given a higher sentence under a recidivism statute\u0097or for that matter, when a sentencing judge, under a guidelines regime or a discretionary sentencing system, increases a sentence based on the defendant's criminal history\u0097100% of the punishment is for the offense of conviction. None is for the prior convictions or the defendant's \"status as a recidivist.\" The sentence \"is a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because [it is] a repetitive one.\" <i>Gryger v.

Since ACCA is a recidivist statute, Congress must have had such provisions in mind and must have understood that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1790</span> \"maximum penalty prescribed by [state] law\" in some cases would be increased by state recidivism provisions.</p>\n<p>Contrary to respondent's suggestion, <i>United States v. LaBonte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118117\"><a href=\"/opinion/118117/united-states-v-labonte/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span>, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997), supports our interpretation of ACCA. The statute at issue in <i>LaBonte,</i> a provision of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h), directed the United States Sentencing Commission to \"assure\" that the Sentencing Guidelines specify a prison sentence \"at or near the maximum term authorized for categories of\" adult offenders who commit their third felony drug offense or violent crime. We held that the phrase \"maximum term authorized\" \"refers to all applicable statutes,\" including recidivist enhancements. 520 U.S., at 758, n. 4, 117 S.Ct. 1673.</p>\n<p>Respondent claims that <i>LaBonte</i> supports his position because ACCA, unlike 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h), does not refer to \"categories of\" offenders. Respondent suggests that Congress' failure to include such language in ACCA means that Congress intended to refer to a \"maximum term\" that does not depend on whether a defendant falls into the first-time-offender or recidivist \"category.\" Respondent does not explain how 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A) could have easily been reworded to mirror 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h). But in any event, the language used in ACCA, for the reasons explained above, is more than clear enough.</p>\n<p>Respondent argues that the Ninth Circuit's decision is supported by the so-called \"categorical\" approach that we used in <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), in determining which offenses qualify as \"violent felon[ies]\" under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) provides that four enumerated crimes\u0097 burglary, arson, extortion, and offenses involving the use of explosives\u0097are \"violent felon[ies]\" for ACCA purposes. In <i>Taylor,</i> we held that Congress intended for these crimes to have a \"uniform definition\" that was \"independent of the labels employed by the various States' criminal codes.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 592, 110 S.Ct. 2143. According to respondent, \"[t]he categorical approach rests on the congressional intent\u0097reflected in the statutory language\u0097to focus the ACCA inquiry on the offense of conviction, rather than on collateral matters unrelated to the definition of the crime.\" Brief for Respondent 12.</p>\n<p>We see no connection, however, between the issue in <i>Taylor</i> (the meaning of the term \"burglary\" in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)) and the issue here (the meaning of the phrase \"maximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law\" under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii)). <i>Taylor</i> held that the meaning of \"burglary\" for purposes of ACCA does not depend on the label attached by the law of a particular State, 495 U.S., at 600-601, 110 S.Ct. 2143, but the \"maximum penalty prescribed by law\" for a state offense necessarily depends on state law.</p>\n<p>For a similar reason, we reject respondent's argument that, under our interpretation, offenses that are not really serious will be included as \"serious drug offense[s]\" because of recidivist enhancements. In \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), Congress chose to rely on the \"maximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed\" by state law as the measure of the seriousness of state offenses involving the manufacture, distribution, or possession of illegal drugs. Congress presumably thought\u0097not without reason\u0097that if state lawmakers provide that a crime is punishable by 10 years' imprisonment, the lawmakers must regard the crime as \"serious,\" and Congress chose to defer to the state lawmakers' judgment. Therefore, our interpretation poses no risk that a drug-trafficking offense will be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1791</span> treated as a \"serious\" without satisfying the standard that Congress prescribed.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Respondent argues that it will often be difficult to determine whether a defendant faced the possibility of a recidivist enhancement in connection with a past state drug conviction and that therefore our interpretation of ACCA will require the federal courts to \"engage in difficult inquiries regarding novel questions of state law and complex factual determinations about long-past proceedings in state courts.\" Brief for Respondent 21. Respondent greatly exaggerates the problems to which he refers.</p>\n<p>First, in some cases, a defendant will have received a recidivist enhancement, and this will necessarily be evident from the length of the sentence imposed. Second, as the present case illustrates, see App. 16, 42, 93, the judgment of conviction will sometimes list the maximum possible sentence even where the sentence that was imposed did not exceed the top sentence allowed without any recidivist enhancement. Third, as respondent himself notes, some jurisdictions require that the prosecution submit a formal charging document in order to obtain a recidivist enhancement. See Brief for Respondent 33. Such documents fall within the limited list of generally available documents that courts already consult for the purpose of determining if a past conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate. See <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 20, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). Fourth, in those cases in which the defendant pleaded guilty to the state drug charges, the plea colloquy will very often include a statement by the trial judge regarding the maximum penalty. This is mandated by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(H), and many States have similar requirements.<sup>[3]</sup> Finally, in those cases in which the records that may properly be consulted do not show that the defendant faced the possibility of a recidivist enhancement, it may well be that the Government will be precluded from establishing that a conviction was for a qualifying offense. The mere possibility that some future cases might present difficulties cannot justify a reading of ACCA that disregards the clear meaning of the statutory language.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1792</span> D</h2>\n<p>Respondent's last argument is that if recidivist enhancements can increase the \"maximum term\" of imprisonment under ACCA, it must follow that mandatory guidelines systems that cap sentences can decrease the \"maximum term\" of imprisonment. Brief for Respondent 38. In each situation, respondent argues, the \"maximum term\" of imprisonment is the term to which the state court could actually have sentenced the defendant. Respondent concedes that he has waived this argument with respect to his own specific state-court convictions. See Brief in Opposition 15, n. 7. He argues, however, that Congress cannot have wanted to make the \"maximum term\" of imprisonment for ACCA purposes dependent on the complexities of state sentencing guidelines. We conclude, however, that the phrase \"maximum term of imprisonment. . . prescribed by law\" for the \"offense\" was not meant to apply to the top sentence in a guidelines range.</p>\n<p>First, the top sentence in a guidelines range is generally not really the \"maximum term . . . prescribed by law\" for the \"offense\" because guidelines systems typically allow a sentencing judge to impose a sentence that exceeds the top of the guidelines range under appropriate circumstances. The United States Sentencing Guidelines, for example, permit \"upward departures,\" see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K2.0 (Nov.2007), and essentially the same characteristic was shared by all of the mandatory guidelines system in existence at the time of the enactment of the ACCA provision at issue in this case.<sup>[4]</sup> (Following this pattern, Washington law likewise provided at the time of respondent's state convictions that a sentencing judge could \"impose a sentence outside the standard sentence range\" upon a finding \"that there [were] substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence.\" Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9.94A.120(2) (1994).<sup>[5]</sup>)</p>\n<p>Second, the concept of the \"maximum\" term of imprisonment or sentence prescribed by law was used in many statutes that predated the enactment of ACCA and the federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-473, \u00a7 211, 98 Stat. 1987, and in all those statutes the concept necessarily referred to the maximum term prescribed by the relevant criminal statute, not the top of a sentencing guideline range. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3 (1982 ed.) (\"[A]n accessory after the fact shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment . . . for the punishment of the principal\"); \u00a7 3575(b) (allowing for an increased sentence for dangerous special offenders \"not disproportionate in severity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1793</span> to the maximum term otherwise authorized by law for\" the underlying felony); see also \u00a7 371 (the punishment for conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor \"shall not exceed the maximum punishment provided for such misdemeanor\"); \u00a7 3651 (allowing for confinement and suspension of sentence upon conviction of an offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment \"if the maximum sentence for such offense is more than six months\"); \u00a7 3653 (referring to the \"maximum probation period\").</p>\n<p>It is instructive that, even in the Sentencing Reform Act, the concept of the \"maximum term of imprisonment\" prescribed for an offense was used in this sense. See \u00a7 212, 98 Stat. 1991-1992 (new 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559 classifying offenses based on \"the maximum term of imprisonment authorized . . . by the statute describing the offense\"); \u00a7 235(b)(1)(F), 98 Stat. 2032 (\"The maximum term of imprisonment in effect on the effective date [of the Sentencing Reform Act]\" remains in effect for five years after the effective date \"for an offense committed before the effective date\"); \u00a7 1003(a), <i>id.,</i> at 2138 (solicitation to commit a crime of violence punishable by \"one-half the maximum term of imprisonment. . . prescribed for the punishment of the crime solicited\"). In light of this established pattern and the relative newness of sentencing guidelines systems when the ACCA provision at issue here was added, we conclude that Congress meant for the concept of the \"maximum term of imprisonment\" prescribed by law for an \"offense\" to have same meaning in ACCA.</p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>United States v. R.L.C.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112709\"><a href=\"/opinion/112709/united-states-v-rlc/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 112 S.Ct. 1329, 117 L.Ed.2d 559 (1992), is not to the contrary. The statutory provision there, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5037(c) (2000 ed.), set out the term of official detention for a juvenile found to be a delinquent. This provision was amended by the Sentencing Reform Act, see \u00a7 214, 98 Stat. 2013, and then amended again two years later, see \u00a7\u00a7 21(a)(2)-(4), 100 Stat. 3596. As thus amended, the provision did not refer to the \"maximum term of imprisonment\" prescribed for an \"offense.\" Rather, the provision focused on the particular juvenile being sentenced. It provided that, \"`in the case of a juvenile who is less than eighteen years old,'\" official detention could not extend beyond the earlier of two dates: the juvenile's 21st birthday or \"`the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult.'\" <i>United States v. R.L.C., supra,</i> at 295-296, 112 S.Ct. 1329, n. 1 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5037(c)). Because this provision clearly focuses on the circumstances of the particular juvenile and not on the offense, 503 U.S., at 299, 112 S.Ct. 1329, it is not analogous to the ACCA provision that is before us in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we hold that the \"maximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law\" for the state drug convictions at issue in this case was the 10-year maximum set by the applicable recidivist provision. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court chooses one reading of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), over another that would make at least as much sense of the statute's ambiguous text and would follow the counsel of a tradition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1794</span> of lenity in construing perplexing criminal laws. The Court's choice, moreover, promises hard times for the trial courts that will have to make the complex sentencing calculations this decision demands. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The ACCA mandates a 15-year minimum sentence for anyone convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g) (2000 ed.) who \"has three previous convictions [for] a serious drug offense\" among his prior crimes. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Section 924(e)(2)(A) (2000 ed.) defines \"serious drug offense\" as an offense under state or federal drug laws, \"for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\" This limitation leaves open the question whether a given conviction qualifies as \"serious\" by reference to the penalty for the acts making up the basic offense, regardless of who commits it, or whether account must also be taken of further facts (such as an offender's criminal record that qualified him for an enhanced penalty at the time of that earlier conviction). If the first alternative is the reading Congress intended, a sentencing judge needs to look only to the penalty specified for the basic offense committed by a first-time offender. But if the second is the intended one, a judge may have to consider sentencing variations (for using a gun, say, or for repeating the offense) set out in other provisions.</p>\n<p>It all turns on the meaning of the word \"offense,\" to which the \"maximum term\" is tied. One can naturally read \"an offense\" at a general level as synonymous with \"a crime,\" which would tend to rule out reference to maximums adjusted for other facts; we do not usually speak of a crime of \"burglary while having a criminal record and while out on bail.\" Those details would come up only if we were speaking about a specific instance, described as a burglary \"committed by someone with a record while out on bail,\" in which case the other facts may \"enhance\" his sentence beyond what would have been the maximum term for burglary. The trouble is that \"offense\" could easily refer to a specific occurrence, too; looking at it that way would make it less jarring to suggest that the circumstances around an event that authorize higher penalty ranges (such as the use of a gun) or the defendant's history (like a prior conviction) ought to count in identifying the maximum penalty for the offense committed on the given day, at the given place, by the particular offender, in a given way. Either reading seems to offer a plausible take on the \"offense\" for which the ACCA court will have to identify or calculate \"maximum\" penalties, under state law.</p>\n<p>We get no help from imagining the circumstances in which a sentencing court would ask which reading to adopt. The choice of answer would be easy if the question arose in the mind of a lawyer whose client is thinking about a guilty plea and asks what maximum term he faces. See <i>ante,</i> at 1787-1788. His lawyer knows that he means the maximum term for him in his case. When a repeat offender wants to know, counsel understands that the penalty prescribed for the basic crime without the recidivist add-on is not the baseline for comparison that may make or break the potential plea agreement. And if the repeat offender faces a further statutory enhancement for carrying a gun during the offense, or for being out on bail, his lawyer would not tell him the maximum term for repeat offenders without guns or bail restrictions. By the same token, if the offender faced (as Rodriquez did) a lower sentence ceiling than what the statute says, by grace of mandatory sentencing guidelines, his lawyer would know enough <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1795</span> to tell him that his maximum was capped in this way.</p>\n<p>When the issue comes up not in a particular client's questions about his own prospects, however, but in a trial judge's mind wondering about the meaning of the general statute, context gives no ready answer. Nor does it break the tie to say, as the Court does, that taking \"maximum\" to refer to the basic offense would mean that a recidivist with add-ons could be sentenced above the ACCA \"maximum,\" see <i>ante,</i> at 1787 (\"even if respondent had been sentenced to, say, six years' imprisonment, `the maximum term of imprisonment' prescribed by law still would have been five years\"). That description, after all, might be just a verbal quirk showing the statutory design in proper working order: if Congress meant an offense to be viewed generically and apart from offender characteristics, a gap between the maximum for ACCA purposes, and a heavier, actual sentence accounting for a defendant's history is to be expected.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The text does not point to any likelier interpretive choices, and as between these alternatives, it is simply ambiguous.<sup>[2]</sup> Because I do not believe its ambiguity is fairly resolved in the Government's favor, I would affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>None of the Court's three principal points or ripostes solves the puzzle. To begin with, there is something arbitrary about trying to resolve the ambiguity by rejecting the maximum-for-basic-offense option while declining to consider an entire class of offender-based sentencing adjustments. If offender characteristics are going to count in identifying the relevant maximum penalty, it would seem to follow that in jurisdictions with mandatory sentencing guidelines, the maximum \"prescribed by law\" would be what the guidelines determine. The original Federal Guidelines, and the mandatory state guidelines I am aware of, were established under statutory authority that invests a guideline with the same legal status as a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1796</span> customary penalty provision. Cf. <i>United States v. R.L. C.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112709\"><a href=\"/opinion/112709/united-states-v-rlc/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 297, 112 S.Ct. 1329, 117 L.Ed.2d 559 (1992) (\"The answer to any suggestion that the statutory character of a specific penalty provision gives it primacy over administrative sentencing guidelines is that the mandate to apply the Guidelines is itself statutory\").</p>\n<p>The Court tries to deflect the implication of its position by denying that state sentencing guidelines really do set maximum penalties, since typically they allow a judge to depart from them, up or down, when specified conditions are met. See <i>ante,</i> at 1792. But while this is true, the objection stands. However a particular mandatory guideline scheme works, it sets a maximum somewhere; if it includes conditions affecting what would otherwise be a guideline maximum, the top of the range as affected should be the relevant maximum on the Court's reading of the statute. Indeed, the factual conditions involved are usually offender characteristics, and if the ACCA is going to count them under offense-defining statutes or freestanding recidivism laws, those same facts ought to count under a guideline rule (whether setting, or authorizing a departure from, a particular limit). There is no practical difference whether maximums are adjusted by a statute, a statutorily mandated guideline, or a guideline-specified departure; wherever a \"prescri[ption] by law\" resides, it ought to be honored by the ACCA court.</p>\n<p>If we were to follow the Court's lights, then, I think we would have to accept the complication that guidelines schemes present, and face the difficulty of calculating enhanced maximums in guidelines jurisdictions.<sup>[3]</sup> What we cannot do is to resolve statutory ambiguity by looking to the sentencing range for an imaginary offender who meets statutory conditions for altering the basic sentence, but is artificially stripped of any characteristic that triggers a guideline rule also \"prescribed by law.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The more fundamental objection, though, goes to the Court's basic conclusion that it makes the better sense to read the ACCA as resting the federal treatment of recidivists on the maximum sentence authorized by state recidivist schemes, in cases where state law must be considered. The Court says it would have been natural for Congress to think in terms of state judgments about repeat criminals when thinking about what to do at the national level, and the Court is quite possibly right about this; the fact that the federal penalty may turn on a state felony classification at all shows that Congress was thinking about state law. But the chances are at least equally good that the Court is wrong; it is odd to think that Congress would have piggybacked the federal system on state repeat-offender schemes, given the extraordinary and irreconcilable variations among state policies on the subject.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the States' recidivism schemes vary in their methods for augmenting sentences. Iowa's law, for example, subjects repeat drug offenders to triple penalties, Iowa Code \u00a7 124.411(1) (2005); but in Wisconsin a repeat drug distributor will see his maximum term increased by a fixed number of years, whatever the starting point, see, <i>e.g.,</i> Wis. Stat. \u00a7 961.48(1)(b) (2003-2004) (4-year increase for Class H felony such as selling 1 kilogram of marijuana).</p>\n<p>More striking than differing structures, though, are the vast disparities in severity from State to State: under Massachusetts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1797</span> drug laws, a third conviction for selling a small amount of marijuana carries a maximum of 2.5 years. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 94C, \u00a7 32C(b) (West 2006). In Delaware, a third conviction means a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole. See Del.Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7 4214(b) (2007) (third-felony penalty of life without parole for violations of non-narcotic controlled substances law, Tit. 16, \u00a7 4752 (2004)). That Congress might have chosen to defer to state-law judgments about \"seriousness\" that vary so widely for the same conduct is at least open to doubt. And that doubt only gets worse when we notice that even where two States have similar maximum penalties for a base-level offense, their recidivist enhancements may lead the same conduct to trigger the ACCA sanction in one State but not the other: on the Court's view, an offender's second conviction for selling, say, just over two pounds of marijuana will qualify as an ACCA predicate crime if the conviction occurred in Arizona (maximum of 13 years), Iowa (15 years), Utah (15 years), and the District of Columbia (10 years), for example;<sup>[4]</sup> but it will fall short of the mark in California (8 years), Michigan (8 years), and New York (8 years).<sup>[5]</sup> Yet in each of these States, the base-level offense has a maximum term falling within a much narrower range (between 3.5 and 5.5 years).<sup>[6]</sup> With this backdrop of state law, the Government can hardly be heard to say that there would be something \"incongruous\" about a federal law targeting offenses flagged by the penalties assigned only to bare conduct, without regard to recidivism or other offender facts. Brief for United States 17.</p>\n<p>Nor does it show what the ACCA means by \"maximum\" or \"offense\" when the Court points to language from our prior cases saying that enhanced recidivist penalties are not to be viewed as retroactive punishment for past crimes, for purposes of double-jeopardy and right-to-counsel enquiries. See <i>ante,</i> at 1789 (citing <i>Nichols v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087959\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087959/nichols-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, 747, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994), and <i>Gryger v. Burke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104578\"><a href=\"/opinion/104578/gryger-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span>, 732, 68 S.Ct. 1256, 92 L.Ed. 1683 (1948)). The quotations show that a separate offense is identified by an enhanced penalty, the Court says, because from them we can draw the conclusion that \"[w]hen a defendant is given a higher sentence under a recidivism statute,\" nonetheless \"100% of the punishment is for the offense of conviction,\" leaving nothing to be attributed to \"prior convictions or the defendant's `status as a recidivist,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 1789.</p>\n<p>Still, the fact is that state-law maximums for repeat offenders sometimes bear <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1798</span> hardly any relation to the gravity of the triggering offense, as \"three-strikes\" laws (not to mention the Delaware example, above) often show. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, \u00a7 5/33B-1 (2004) (mandatory life sentence for third \"Class X\" felony, such as dealing heroin, without regard to the specific penalty gradation for the latest Class X felony or to any similarity with prior offenses); W. Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 61-11-18(c) (2005) (if offender was \"twice before convicted in the United States of a crime punishable by confinement in a penitentiary,\" third such conviction incurs a mandatory life sentence). Cf. <i>Ewing v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127897\"><a href=\"/opinion/127897/ewing-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 30, n. 2, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (plurality opinion) (the \"California Legislature therefore made a deliberate policy decision . . . that the gravity of the new felony should not be a determinative factor in triggering the application of the Three Strikes Law\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). And there is no denying that the fact of prior convictions (or a defendant's recidivist status) is necessary for the \"`stiffened penalty'\" to be imposed for \"`the latest crime,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 1789, the necessary fact being specific to the offender, and falling outside the definition of the offense. This is, after all, what it means to apply an \"enhancement.\"</p>\n<p>The upshot is that it may have been natural for Congress to think of state recidivism schemes, but it may well not have been. If there is anything strange about ignoring enhanced penalties, there is something at least as strange about a federal recidivist statute that piles enhancement on enhancement, magnifying the severity of state laws severe to begin with.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Whatever may be the plausibility of the offender-based reading of the statute as the Court describes it, the Court's description avoids a source of serious doubt by glossing over the practical problems its take on the statute portends. The Court is unmoved by the argument that Congress probably did not expect federal courts applying the ACCA to master the countless complications of state sentencing schemes; because all jurisdictions provide for enhanced sentencing some way or another, the Court thinks there is nothing threatening in the subject, which it tries to simplify by offering a few practical pointers. It notes that there will be cases with a qualifying enhancement \"evident from the length of the sentence imposed\" by the state court; sometimes, it says, a court's \"judgment of conviction will . . . list the maximum possible sentence\"; or the state prosecutor will have \"submit[ted] a formal charging document in order to obtain a recidivist enhancement.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1791. And in cases involving pleas, the Court notes, \"the plea colloquy will very often include a statement by the trial judge regarding the maximum penalty.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Even when there are no pointers to help, says the Court, and \"the records that may properly be consulted\" yield no clear answer, the worst that can happen will be the Government's inability to show that a prior conviction qualifies. <i>Ante,</i> at 1791.</p>\n<p>But it is not that easy, and the Court's pointers are not much comfort. To start with, even where a \"maximum\" sentence is mentioned in state records, how will the ACCA court be supposed to know that the \"maximum\" written down there is what the Court today holds that \"maximum\" means? A State's number below 10 years may refer to the base-level offense, or it may be the reduced maximum required by mandatory guidelines; and a number over 10 years may be the product of other enhancements (as for weapons use or being out on bail at the time of commission). Having to enquire into just what imposed sentences or what trial documents really <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1799</span> mean would seem to leave plenty of sorting out for the federal courts to do (or at least, for federal prosecutors, if they end up with the job).</p>\n<p>Another example: State laws are not written to coordinate with the ACCA, and if a State's specific repeat drug-offender provisions, say, are supposed to be read together with its general habitual-offender statutes, the resulting \"maximum\" may not be the Court's \"maximum.\" Indeed, a federal court may have to figure out just how those state statutes may be read together to avoid conflict between them, when the way to avoid conflict is not clear cut even for the state courts, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Goldberg v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1387669\"><a href=\"/opinion/1387669/goldberg-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1387669\"><a href=\"/opinion/1387669/goldberg-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span> (2007) (general recidivist statute trumps more specific one; overruling same court's decision in <i>Mikell v.

Cf. <i>Clines v. State,</i> 912 So.2d 550 (Fla.2005) (relying on rule of lenity to resolve whether multiple recidivist categories in same habitual-offender law could apply to a single sentence).</p>\n<p>And there is more: as Rodriquez reminds us, just deciding what counts as a \"prior\" offense under state law is not always an easy thing. See <i>People v. Wiley,</i> 9 Cal.4th 580, 583, 38 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1436452\"><a href=\"/opinion/1436452/people-v-wiley/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span>, 542 (1995) (noting difficulty of applying requirement that \"prior\" charges have been \"brought and tried separately,\" where defendant had been convicted in trials occurring one day apart and sentenced at the same court session; in the end, drawing the needed inference from docket numbers revealed on documents requested from the municipal trial court); <i>id.,</i> at 595, 38 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, 889 P.2d, at 550 (Werdegar, J., dissenting) (protesting the court's solicitation and use of extra-record documents). Nor would that sort of enquiry get any easier, or be more likely to benefit from well-settled state law, when a given State's law takes account of prior offenses in other States, see <i>Timothy v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2634672\"><a href=\"/opinion/2634672/timothy-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span> (Alaska App. 2004) (holding Oklahoma burglary not to be analogous to one in Alaska, for purposes of Alaska's recidivism enhancements, thus overruling its own 2-year-old decision, <i>Butts v.

See, <i>e.g.,</i> N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:44-4(c) (West 2005) (\"A conviction in another jurisdiction shall constitute a prior conviction of a crime if a sentence of imprisonment in excess of 6 months was authorized under the law of the other jurisdiction\"); N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-18-17(D)(2)(b) (2007 Supp.) (defining \"prior felony conviction\" as, <i>inter alia,</i> a felony \"punishable [by] a maximum term of imprisonment of more than one year\").</p>\n<p>A still thornier problem is how federal courts are supposed to treat a State's procedural safeguards for using prior convictions at sentencing. Saying that congressional deference to the States' judgments about the severity of crimes also extends to their judgments about recidivism raises, but does not answer, the question whether such deference goes only as far as the state courts themselves could go in raising penalties. (The Court's disregard of mandatory sentencing guidelines would seem to suggest that the answer is no.) In those States that require notice before the prosecutor can seek a recidivism enhancement, for example, how will a federal court decide whether the ACCA counts a prior conviction that would have qualified for recidivism enhancement if the state prosecutor had not failed to give timely notice? <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1800</span> See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Commonwealth v. Fernandes,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></span>, 522, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></span>, 409 (1999) (noting longstanding rule that the indictment must give notice of prior convictions \"that may subject the defendant to enhanced punishment\").</p>\n<p>I could go on, but this is enough to show that the Court's interpretation promises that ACCA courts will face highly complicated enquiries into every State's or Territory's collection of ancillary sentencing laws. That is an unconvincing answer to the ambiguity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, a plainly superior reading may well be elusive; one favoring the Government certainly is. It does not defy common English or common sense, after all, to look at a statute with one penalty range for the basic crime and a higher one for a repeat offender and say that the former sets the maximum penalty for the \"offense\"; but neither is it foolish to see the \"offense\" as defined by its penalty, however that is computed. What I have said so far suggests that I think the basic-crime view of \"offense\" is the better one, but I will concede that the competing positions are pretty close to evenly matched. And on that assumption, there is a ready tie-breaker.</p>\n<p>The interpretation adopted by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals is the one counseled by the rule of lenity, which applies where (as here) we have \"`seiz[ed] every thing from which aid can be derived,'\" but are \"left with an ambiguous statute,\" <i>United States v. Bass,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108421\"><a href=\"/opinion/108421/united-states-v-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) (quoting <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> 2 Cranch 358, 386, 2 L.Ed. 304 (1805) (opinion of the Court by Marshall, C. J.)). The rule is grounded in \"`the instinctive distaste against men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly said they should,'\" <i>Bass, supra,</i> at 348, 92 S.Ct. 515 (quoting H. Friendly, Benchmarks 209 (1967)), and we have used it to resolve questions both about metes and bounds of criminal conduct and about the severity of sentencing. See <i>Bifulco v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110305\"><a href=\"/opinion/110305/bifulco-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980) (collecting cases). \"This policy of lenity means that the Court will not interpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\" <i>Ladner v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105801\"><a href=\"/opinion/105801/ladner-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span>, 178, 79 S.Ct. 209, 3 L.Ed.2d 199 (1958).</p>\n<p>This is why lenity should control here. Even recognizing the best that can be said for the Government's side, its position rests on debatable guesswork to send a man to prison for 180 months, as against 92 months on the basic-crime view. And the District Courts will be imposing higher sentences more than doubling the length of the alternative in a good many other cases, as well.</p>\n<p>The \"fair warning\" that motivates the lenity rule, <i>McBoyle v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101695\"><a href=\"/opinion/101695/mcboyle-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931) (opinion of the Court by Holmes, J.), may sometimes be a benign fiction, see <i>R.L.C.,</i> 503 U.S., at 309, 112 S.Ct. 1329 (SCALIA, J., concurring), but there is only one reading of this statute with any realistic chance of giving fair notice of how the ACCA will apply, and that is the reading the District Court and the Court of Appeals each chose. Their choice should be ours, too.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  \"Except as authorized by this chapter, it is unlawful for any person to manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance.\" Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401(a)(1994).</p>\n<p>[2]  In any event, the only \"minor drug crime\" that respondent identifies as potentially constituting an ACCA predicate based on recidivist enhancement is distribution of a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812, Schedule III narcotic in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 333.7401(2)(b)(ii) (West Supp.2007). Given that Schedule III substances include anabolic steroids and painkillers with specified amounts of certain narcotics like opium, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812, one might debate respondent's assertion that distribution of these narcotics is not \"serious\" in the generic sense of the word. However, Congress chose to defer to the Michigan Legislature's judgment that the offense was \"serious\" enough to warrant punishment of first offenses by up to seven years' imprisonment, and certain repeat offenses by a maximum term of life imprisonment.

See Frase, State Sentencing Guidelines: Diversity, Consensus, and Unresolved Policy Issues, 105 Colum. L.Rev. 1190, 1196, Table 1 (2005). Two of those States (Utah and Maryland) had voluntary guidelines, <i>id.,</i> at 1198, and the other six States had guidelines systems that allowed for sentences in excess of the recommended range in various circumstances, see <i>People v.

The Government seems to accept this possibility, noting that \"if a statute is as a formal matter structured in such a way as to create broad tiers of punishment for categories of offenders\" based on factors other than recidivism, \"then certainly that would seem to be an alternative maximum term of imprisonment.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 21. The Court, however, does not address this prospect, despite having seen the same kind of result as a dealbreaker for Rodriquez's view.</p>\n<p>[2]  Even adopting the \"alternative\" of accounting for an offender's circumstances and record does not resolve the ambiguity, for this rubric actually comprises multiple possibilities under its generic umbrella. Most simply, it might be thought to refer to the actual offender's sentencing range as applied by the state court. At the other extreme, it might mean the maximum for a purely hypothetical \"worst\" offender who incurs all possible add-ons. Or perhaps it means a fictional version of the actual offender, say, one qualifying for some statutory add-ons but not for any guidelines rules (as the Court would have it); or maybe one who qualifies for both the statutory and the guidelines departures for which the actual offender was eligible, even though not all of those departures were applied by the state court. This menagerie of options would be multiplied, if a court directly confronted the choice whether to count enhancements for offender-based factors other than recidivism, and if so, which.</p>\n<p>[3]  In this case, doing so would likely result in affirmance, because as the Government admits, Rodriquez's guidelines ceiling was just shy of five years.
