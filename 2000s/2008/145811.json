De Pue, Attorney Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for United States.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Respondent attempted to enter the United States by car ferry at Port Angeles, Washington. Hidden in the trunk of his rental car were explosives that he intended to detonate at the Los Angeles International Airport. After the ferry docked, respondent was questioned by a customs official, who instructed him to complete a customs declaration form; respondent did so, identifying himself on the form as a Canadian citizen (he is Algerian) named Benni Noris (his name is Ahmed Ressam). Respondent was then directed to a secondary inspection station, where another official performed a search of his car. The official discovered explosives and related items in the car's spare tire well.</p>\n<p>Respondent was subsequently convicted of a number of crimes, including the felony of making a false statement to a United States customs official in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (1994 ed., Supp. V) (Count 5) and carrying an explosive \"during the commission of that felony in violation of \u00a7 844(h)(2) (1994 ed.) (Count 9). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit set aside his conviction on Count 9 because it read the word \"during,\" as used in \u00a7 844(h)(2), to include a requirement that the explosive be carried \"in relation to\" the underlying felony. 474 F.3d 597 (2007). Because that construction of the statute conflicted with decisions of other Courts of Appeals, we granted certiorari.<sup>[1]</sup> 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 741, 169 L.Ed.2d 579 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The most natural reading of the relevant statutory text provides a sufficient basis for reversal. That text reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Whoever\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) uses fire or an explosive to commit any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) carries an explosive during the commission of any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the United States,</blockquote>\n<p>\"including a felony which provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1861</span> imprisonment for 10 years.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h).</p>\n<p>It is undisputed that the items hidden in respondent's car were \"explosives.\"<sup>[2]</sup> It is also undisputed that respondent was \"carr[ying]\" those explosives when he knowingly made false statements to a customs official, and that those statements violated \u00a7 1001 (1994 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>There is no need to consult dictionary definitions of the word \"during\" in order to arrive at the conclusion that respondent engaged in the precise conduct described in \u00a7 844(h)(2) (1994 ed.). The term \"during\" denotes a temporal link; that is surely the most natural reading of the word as used in the statute. Because respondent's carrying of the explosives was contemporaneous with his violation of \u00a7 1001, he carried them \"during\" that violation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The history of the statute we construe today further supports our conclusion that Congress did not intend to require the Government to establish a relationship between the explosive carried and the underlying felony. Congress originally enacted \u00a7 844(h)(2) as part of its \"Regulation of Explosives\" in Title XI of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 957. The provision was modeled after a portion of the Gun Control Act of 1968, \u00a7 102, 82 Stat. 1224, codified, as amended, at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The earlier statute mandated at least 1 and no more than 10 years' imprisonment for any person who \"carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the United States.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) (1964 ed., Supp. IV). Except for the word \"explosive\" in \u00a7 844(h)(2), instead of the word \"firearm\" in \u00a7 924(c)(2), the two provisions as originally enacted were identical.</p>\n<p>In 1984, Congress redrafted the firearm statute; it increased the penalties attached to the provision and, most significantly for our purposes, deleted the word \"unlawfully\" and inserted the words \"and in relation to\" immediately after the word \"during.\" \u00a7 1005(a), 98 Stat. 2138. Reviewing a conviction for an offense that was committed before the amendment but not decided on appeal until after its enactment, the Ninth Circuit held that the original version of the firearm statute had implicitly included the \"in relation to\" requirement that was expressly added while the case was pending on appeal. As then-Judge Kennedy explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The statute as written when Stewart committed the offense provided in pertinent part that it was a crime to `carr[y] a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any felony. . . .' 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) (1982). In 1984, Congress revised section 924(c) . . . . The 1984 amendment substituted for the word `during' the phrase `during <i>and in relation to.</i>' 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c) (West Supp.1985) (emphasis added). Our study of the legislative history of the amendment . . . indicates the `in relation to' language was not intended to create an element of the crime that did not previously exist, but rather was intended to make clear a condition already implicit in the statute. The legislative history reveals that because the amendment eliminated the requirement that the firearm be carried unlawfully, 18 U.S.C.A. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1862</span> \u00a7 924(c) (West Supp.1985), the `in relation to' language was added to allay explicitly the concern that a person could be prosecuted under section 924(c) for committing an entirely unrelated crime while in possession of a firearm. Though the legislative history does not say so expressly, it strongly implies that the `in relation to' language did not alter the scope of the statute. . . .\" <i>United States v. Stewart,</i> 779 F.2d 538, 539-540 (1985) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Relying on that Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals in this case concluded that the explosives statute, like the firearm statute, implicitly included a requirement of a relationship between possession of the item in question and the underlying felony. Whatever the merits of the argument that \u00a7 924(c) as originally enacted contained a relational requirement, the subsequent changes to both statutes convince us that the Government's reading of \u00a7 844(h) as presently written is correct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In 1988, Congress enacted the \"Explosives Offenses Amendments,\" \u00a7 6474(b), 102 Stat. 4379, which modified the text of \u00a7 844(h). Those amendments increased the penalties for violating the provision, \u00a7 6474(b)(2), <i>id.,</i> at 4380; they also deleted the word \"unlawfully,\" \u00a7 6474(b)(1), <i>ibid.</i> Unlike its earlier amendment to the firearm statute, however, Congress did not also insert the words \"and in relation to\" after the word \"during.\" While it is possible that this omission was inadvertent, that possibility seems remote given the stark difference that was thereby introduced into the otherwise similar texts of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 844(h) and 924(c).</p>\n<p>Even if the similarity of the original texts of the two statutes might have supported an inference that both included an implicit relationship requirement, their current difference virtually commands the opposite inference. While the two provisions were initially identical, Congress' replacement of the word \"unlawfully\" in the firearm statute with the phrase \"and in relation to,\" coupled with the deletion of the word \"unlawfully\" without any similar replacement in the explosives statute, convinces us that Congress did not intend to introduce a relational requirement into the explosives provision, but rather intended us to accept the more straightforward reading of \u00a7 844(h). Since respondent was carrying explosives when he violated \u00a7 1001, he was carrying them \"during\" the commission of that felony. The statute as presently written requires nothing further.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice SCALIA joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Because the plain language of the statute squarely answers the question presented in this case, I join only Part I of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The statute before us imposes a mandatory 10-year sentence on any person who \"carries an explosive during the commission of any [federal] felony.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h)(2). The Ninth Circuit interpreted the statute as requiring a \"relation\" between the explosives-carrying and the felony (here, making a false statement to a customs officer), such that the explosives-carrying \"`facilitated'\" or \"aided\" the commission of the felony. 474 F.3d 597, 604 (2007). The Court interprets the statute to the contrary. It holds that the statute requires no more than a \"temporal link\" between the explosives-carrying and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1863</span> the felony, that is to say, the two need only have occurred at the same time. See <i>ante,</i> at 1861. I cannot agree with either interpretation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>My problem with the Court's interpretation is that it would permit conviction of any individual who legally carries explosives at the time that he engages in a totally unrelated felony. \"Explosives,\" the statute tells us, includes not only obviously explosive material such as \"gunpowders\" and \"dynamite\" but also any \"chemical compounds\" or \"mixture[s]\" or \"device[s]\" whose \"ignition by fire, by friction, by concussion\" or other means \"may cause an explosion.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(j). And that definition encompasses such commonplace materials as kerosene, gasoline, or certain fertilizers. Moreover, the \"carr[ying]\" to which the statute refers includes carrying that is otherwise legal. Further, the statute applies to the carrying of explosives during \"any\" federal felony, a category that ranges from murder to mail fraud. See \u00a7 1111 (2000 ed. and Supp. V); \u00a7 1341 (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>Consequently the Court's opinion brings within the statute's scope (and would impose an additional mandatory 10-year prison term upon), for example, a farmer lawfully transporting a load of fertilizer who intentionally mails an unauthorized lottery ticket to a friend, a hunter lawfully carrying gunpowder for shotgun shells who buys snacks with a counterfeit $20 bill, a truckdriver lawfully transporting diesel fuel who lies to a customs official about the value of presents he bought in Canada for his family, or an accountant who engaged in a 6-year-long conspiracy to commit tax evasion and who, one day during that conspiracy, bought gas for his lawnmower. In such instances the lawful carrying of an \"explosive\" has <i>nothing whatsoever</i> to do with the unlawful felonies. I cannot imagine why Congress would have wanted the presence of totally irrelevant, lawful behavior to trigger an additional 10-year mandatory prison term.</p>\n<p>The statute's language does not demand such an interpretation. I agree with the majority that the word \"during\" requires a \"temporal link.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 1861. But a statement that uses the word \"during\" may or may not imply <i>other</i> limitations as well, depending upon the context in which the statement is made. Thus, when I tell a friend from Puerto Rico, \"I wear gloves during Washington's winter,\" he does not think I mean baseball mitts. Rather, I imply (and he understands) a relation or link between the gloves and the winter. When I say to a group of lawyers, \"I take notes during oral argument,\" I imply (and they understand) that the notes bear a relation to the law being argued. But when I say, \"I called my brother during the day,\" I do not imply any particular relation (other than a temporal relation) between the day and the phone call. Context makes the difference.</p>\n<p>Here, the statute's context makes clear that the statutory statement does not cover a \"carr[ying]\" of explosives that is totally unrelated to the \"felony.\" The lengthy mandatory minimum sentence is evidence of what the statute's legislative history separately indicates, namely that Congress sought to criminalize and impose harsh penalties in respect to the \"intentional <i>misuse</i> of explosives,\" see H.R.Rep. No. 91-1549, p. 38 (1970), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1970, pp. 4007, 4013 (emphasis added) (hereinafter H.R. Rep.). A person who <i>lawfully</i> carries explosives while committing some other felony does not even arguably \"misuse\" those explosives unless the carrying has something to do with the other felony. Nor in the absence of some such relationship is there any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1864</span> obvious reason to impose an additional mandatory 10-year sentence on a person who <i>unlawfully</i> carries explosives while committing some other felony.</p>\n<p>Similar reasoning led the Ninth Circuit in 1985 to interpret a related statute, which punished the carrying of a <i>firearm</i> \"during\" the commission of a federal felony, as requiring a significant relationship between the firearms-carrying and the other felony. See <i>United States v. Stewart,</i> 779 F.2d 538. Justice (then-Judge) KENNEDY recognized that \"`Congress did not intend to penalize one who happens to have a gun in his possession when he commits an entirely unrelated offense.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 540 (quoting <i>United States v. Moore,</i> 580 F.2d 360, 362 (C.A.9 1978)). In my view, that same reasoning should apply when we interpret the explosives statute, which was originally modeled on the firearms statute. See H.R. Rep., at 69, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1970, pp. 4007, 4046 (the explosives statute \"carries over to the explosives area the stringent provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 relating to the use of firearms and the unlawful carrying of firearms to commit, or during the commission of a Federal felony\").</p>\n<p>I recognize that the language of the firearms statute now differs from the language of the explosives statute in an important way. The firearms statute originally punished (with a 1-to-10-year sentence) a person who \"carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any [federal] felony.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) (1964 ed., Supp. IV). In 1984, Congress amended the firearms statute by providing a mandatory minimum punishment of five years and by striking the word \"unlawfully.\" \u00a7 1005(a), 98 Stat. 2138. When it did so, Congress also added to the statute specific words of limitation, namely the words \"and in relation to\" (so that the statute covered any person who carried a firearm \"during and in relation to\" the commission of a \"felony\"). <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The words \"in relation to\" do not appear in the explosives statute. But neither did those words appear in the pre-1984 version of the firearms statute that was the subject of the Ninth Circuit opinion in <i>Stewart</i> (yet the Ninth Circuit nonetheless found an implicit relational requirement). And the fact that these words now appear in the firearms statute but not the explosives statute cannot make the determinative difference.</p>\n<p>The history of the firearms statute makes clear that the reason Congress added to that statute the words \"in relation to\" has to do with Congress' decision to remove from the firearms statute the word \"unlawfully\". By removing that word, Congress indicated that the firearms statute should apply to \"persons who are licensed to carry firearms\" but who \"abuse that privilege by committing a crime with the weapon.\" S.Rep. No. 98-225, p. 314, n. 10 (1984), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1984, pp. 3182, 3492. At the same time, however, Congress believed that the statute should not apply where the firearm's presence \"played no part in the crime, such as a gun carried in a pocket and never displayed or referred to in the course of a pugilistic barroom fight.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The addition of the words \"in relation to\" made this dual objective textually clear.</p>\n<p>The absence of the words \"in relation to\" here must lead us to ask (but it does not answer) the question: Did Congress intend something different in respect to the explosives statute? There are strong reasons for thinking it did not. Congress, after all, amended the explosives statute in response to the Department of Justice's express request to \"bring\" the explosives statute \"in line with\" the firearms statute. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1865</span> See 131 Cong. Rec. 14166 (1985); see also 134 Cong. Rec. 32700 (1988) (statement of Sen. Biden) (noting that the purpose of amending the explosives statute was to \"bring it in line with similar amendments [previously] adopted . . . with respect to the parallel offense of using or carrying a firearm during the commission of federal offenses\"). Congress accordingly increased the mandatory minimum punishment to five years and struck the word \"unlawfully.\" See \u00a7 6474(b), 102 Stat. 4379-4380. If Congress, in neglecting to add the words \"in relation to,\" sought to create a meaningful distinction between the explosives and firearms statutes, one would think that someone somewhere would have mentioned this objective.</p>\n<p>Further, to read the two statutes differently would break the very parallel treatment of firearms and explosives that led Congress, at the Department of Justice's urging, to amend the explosives statute in the first place. It would produce the peculiar and unfair results I previously mentioned. See <i>supra,</i> at 1860. It would conflict with Congress' original rationale for enacting the explosives statute (to punish the <i>misuse</i> of explosives). And it would risk incoherent results: Why would Congress wish not to punish a policeman for carrying an unrelated revolver during the commission of a felony, but then wish to punish that same policeman for carrying unrelated gunpowder for unrelated bullets?</p>\n<p>At the same time one can explain the absence of the words \"in relation to\" in less damaging ways. The legislative drafters of the explosives amendment may have assumed that prior judicial interpretation, (namely, <i>United States v. Stewart,</i> 779 F.2d 538) made the words \"in relation to\" unnecessary. See <i>Lorillard v. Pons,</i> 434 U.S. 575, 580, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978) (\"Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change\"). Or, as the majority recognizes, the omission of the language may reflect simple drafting inadvertence. See <i>ante,</i> at 1862.</p>\n<p>I concede that the presence of a phrase in one statute and the absence of the same phrase in another related statute can signal an intended difference in relative statutory scope. But that is not inevitably so. Cf. <i>Russello v. United States,</i> 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (noting only a <i>presumption</i> that Congress has acted intentionally and purposely if it \"includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). And here the circumstances that I have mentioned make this a case in which that linguistic fact is not determinative.</p>\n<p>No more here than elsewhere in life can words alone explain every nuance of their intended application. Context matters. And if judges are to give meaningful effect to the intent of the enacting legislature, they must interpret statutory text with reference to the statute's purpose and its history.</p>\n<p>The Court, with its decision today, makes possible the strange results I describe above precisely because it resolves the statutory interpretation question by examining the meaning of just one word in isolation. In context, however, the language excludes from the statute's scope instances in which there is no significant relation between the explosives-carrying and the felony. A contextual interpretation furthers Congress' original purpose, is less likely to encourage random punishment, and is consistent with the statute's overall history. As a result, like the Ninth Circuit, I would read the statute as insisting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1866</span> upon some (other than merely temporal) relationship between explosives carrying and \"felony.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>At the same time, I cannot agree with the Ninth Circuit that the statute restricts the requisite relationship to one in which the carrying of the explosives \"`facilitated'\" (or \"aided\") the <i>felony.</i> 474 F.3d, at 604. In my view, the statute must also cover a felony committed to facilitate the <i>carrying of explosives.</i> Why should it matter in which direction the facilitating flows? Either way, there is a relation between the carrying of explosives and the other felony. Either way, one might reasonably conclude that the presence of the explosives will elevate the risks of harm that otherwise would ordinarily arise out of the felony's commission. Either way, one might consider the explosives \"misused.\" Thus, I believe the statute applies if the felony, here, the making of a false statement to a customs officer, facilitated or aided the carrying of explosives. And I would remand the case for the Circuit to determine the presence or absence of that relevant relation.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Both the Third and Fifth Circuits have declined to interpret \u00a7 844(h)(2) as requiring that the explosive be carried in relation to the underlying felony. See <i>United States v. Rosenberg,</i> 806 F.2d 1169, 1178-1179 (C.A.3 1986) (\"The plain everyday meaning of `during' is `at the same time' or `at a point in the course of....' It does not normally mean `at the same time and in connection with.....' It is not fitting for this court to declare that the crime defined by \u00a7 844(h)(2) has more elements than those enumerated on the face of the statute\"); <i>United States v. Ivy,</i> 929 F.2d 147, 151 (C.A.5 1991) (\"Section 844(h)(2) ... does not include the relation element Ivy urges .... We ... refuse to judicially append the relation element to \u00a7 844(h)(2)\").</p>\n<p>[2]  Because respondent concedes that the items in his car were \"explosives,\" we have no occasion to determine the boundaries of that term as used in the statute. Specifically, we do not comment on when, if ever, \"such commonplace materials as kerosene, gasoline, or certain fertilizers,\" <i>post,</i> at 1863 (BREYER, J., dissenting), might fall within the definition of \"explosive.\"</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued March 25, 2008\u2014Decided May 19, 2008\nAfter respondent gave false information on his customs form while at-\n  tempting to enter the United States, a search of his car revealed ex-\n  plosives that he intended to detonate in this country. He was con-\n  victed of, inter alia, (1) feloniously making a false statement to a\n  customs official in violation of 18 U. S.

Hidden in the trunk of\nhis rental car were explosives that he intended to detonate\nat the Los Angeles International Airport. After the ferry\ndocked, respondent was questioned by a customs official,\nwho instructed him to complete a customs declaration\nform; respondent did so, identifying himself on the form as\na Canadian citizen (he is Algerian) named Benni Noris\n(his name is Ahmed Ressam). Respondent was then di-\nrected to a secondary inspection station, where another\nofficial performed a search of his car. The official discov-\nered explosives and related items in the car\u2019s spare tire\nwell.\n  Respondent was subsequently convicted of a number of\ncrimes, including the felony of making a false statement to\na United States customs official in violation of 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71001 (1994 ed., Supp. V) (Count 5) and carrying an explo-\nsive \u201cduring the commission of\u201d that felony in violation of\n\u00a7844(h)(2) (1994 ed.) (Count 9). The Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit set aside his conviction on Count 9\nbecause it read the word \u201cduring,\u201d as used in \u00a7844(h)(2), to\n2                    UNITED STATES v. RESSAM\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninclude a requirement that the explosive be carried \u201cin\nrelation to\u201d the underlying felony. 474 F. 3d 597 (2007).\nBecause that construction of the statute conflicted with\ndecisions of other Courts of Appeals, we granted certio-\nrari.1 552 U. S. ___ (2007).\n                               I\n  The most natural reading of the relevant statutory text\nprovides a sufficient basis for reversal. That text reads:\n       \u201cWhoever\u2014\n       \u201c(1) uses fire or an explosive to commit any felony\n       which may be prosecuted in a court of the United\n       States, or\n       \u201c(2) carries an explosive during the commission of any\n       felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the\n       United States,\n\u201cincluding a felony which provides for an enhanced pun-\nishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous\nweapon or device shall, in addition to the punishment\nprovided for such felony, be sentenced to imprisonment for\n10 years.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7844(h).\n  It is undisputed that the items hidden in respondent\u2019s\ncar were \u201cexplosives.\u201d2 It is also undisputed that respon-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Boththe Third and Fifth Circuits have declined to interpret\n\u00a7844(h)(2) as requiring that the explosive be carried in relation to the\nunderlying felony. See United States v. Rosenberg, 806 F. 2d 1169,\n1178\u20131179 (CA3 1986) (\u201cThe plain everyday meaning of \u2018during\u2019 is \u2018at\nthe same time\u2019 or \u2018at a point in the course of. . . . It does not normally\nmean \u2018at the same time and in connection with. . . .\u2019 It is not fitting for\nthis court to declare that the crime defined by \u00a7844(h)(2) has more\nelements than those enumerated on the face of the statute\u201d); United\nStates v. Ivy, 929 F. 2d 147, 151 (CA5 1991) (\u201cSection 844(h)(2) . . . does\nnot include the relation element Ivy urges. . . . We . . . refuse to judi-\ncially append the relation element to \u00a7844(h)(2)\u201d).\n  2 Because respondent concedes that the items in his car were \u201cexplo-\n\nsives,\u201d we have no occasion to determine the boundaries of that term as\nused in the statute. Specifically, we do not comment on when, if ever,\n                      Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndent was \u201ccarr[ying]\u201d those explosives when he knowingly\nmade false statements to a customs official, and that those\nstatements violated \u00a71001 (1994 ed., Supp. V).\n   There is no need to consult dictionary definitions of the\nword \u201cduring\u201d in order to arrive at the conclusion that\nrespondent engaged in the precise conduct described in\n\u00a7844(h)(2) (1994 ed.). The term \u201cduring\u201d denotes a tempo-\nral link; that is surely the most natural reading of the\nword as used in the statute. Because respondent\u2019s carry-\ning of the explosives was contemporaneous with his viola-\ntion of \u00a71001, he carried them \u201cduring\u201d that violation.\n                             II\n  The history of the statute we construe today further\nsupports our conclusion that Congress did not intend to\nrequire the Government to establish a relationship be-\ntween the explosive carried and the underlying felony.\nCongress originally enacted \u00a7844(h)(2) as part of its \u201cRegu-\nlation of Explosives\u201d in Title XI of the Organized Crime\nControl Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 957. The provision was\nmodeled after a portion of the Gun Control Act of 1968,\n\u00a7102, 82 Stat. 1224, codified, as amended, at 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(c) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The earlier statute man-\ndated at least 1 and no more than 10 years\u2019 imprisonment\nfor any person who \u201ccarries a firearm unlawfully during\nthe commission of any felony which may be prosecuted in\na court of the United States.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2) (1964\ned., Supp. IV).     Except for the word \u201cexplosive\u201d in\n\u00a7844(h)(2), instead of the word \u201cfirearm\u201d in \u00a7924(c)(2), the\ntwo provisions as originally enacted were identical.\n  In 1984, Congress redrafted the firearm statute; it\nincreased the penalties attached to the provision and,\nmost significantly for our purposes, deleted the word\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201csuch commonplace materials as kerosene, gasoline, or certain fertiliz-\ners,\u201d post, at 2 (BREYER, J., dissenting), might fall within the definition\nof \u201cexplosive.\u201d\n4                 UNITED STATES v. RESSAM\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cunlawfully\u201d and inserted the words \u201cand in relation to\u201d\nimmediately after the word \u201cduring.\u201d \u00a71005(a), 98 Stat.\n2138. Reviewing a conviction for an offense that was\ncommitted before the amendment but not decided on\nappeal until after its enactment, the Ninth Circuit held\nthat the original version of the firearm statute had implic-\nitly included the \u201cin relation to\u201d requirement that was\nexpressly added while the case was pending on appeal. As\nthen-Judge Kennedy explained:\n      \u201cThe statute as written when Stewart committed the\n      offense provided in pertinent part that it was a crime\n      to \u2018carr[y] a firearm unlawfully during the commission\n      of any felony. . . .\u2019 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2) (1982). In\n      1984, Congress revised section 924(c) . . . . The 1984\n      amendment substituted for the word \u2018during\u2019 the\n      phrase \u2018during and in relation to.\u2019 18 U. S. C. A.\n      \u00a7924(c) (West Supp. 1985) (emphasis added). Our\n      study of the legislative history of the amendment . . .\n      indicates the \u2018in relation to\u2019 language was not in-\n      tended to create an element of the crime that did not\n      previously exist, but rather was intended to make\n      clear a condition already implicit in the statute. The\n      legislative history reveals that because the amend-\n      ment eliminated the requirement that the firearm be\n      carried unlawfully, 18 U. S. C. A. \u00a7924(c) (West Supp.\n      1985), the \u2018in relation to\u2019 language was added to allay\n      explicitly the concern that a person could be prose-\n      cuted under section 924(c) for committing an entirely\n      unrelated crime while in possession of a firearm.\n      Though the legislative history does not say so ex-\n      pressly, it strongly implies that the \u2018in relation to\u2019\n      language did not alter the scope of the statute . . . .\u201d\n      United States v. Stewart, 779 F. 2d 538, 539\u2013540\n      (1985) (citations omitted).\n    Relying on that Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin this case concluded that the explosives statute, like the\nfirearm statute, implicitly included a requirement of a\nrelationship between possession of the item in question\nand the underlying felony. Whatever the merits of the\nargument that \u00a7924(c) as originally enacted contained a\nrelational requirement, the subsequent changes to both\nstatutes convince us that the Government\u2019s reading of\n\u00a7844(h) as presently written is correct.\n                             III\n   In 1988, Congress enacted the \u201cExplosives Offenses\nAmendments,\u201d \u00a76474(b), 102 Stat. 4379, which modified\nthe text of \u00a7844(h). Those amendments increased the\npenalties for violating the provision, \u00a76474(b)(2), id., at\n4380; they also deleted the word \u201cunlawfully,\u201d\n\u00a76474(b)(1), ibid. Unlike its earlier amendment to the\nfirearm statute, however, Congress did not also insert the\nwords \u201cand in relation to\u201d after the word \u201cduring.\u201d While\nit is possible that this omission was inadvertent, that\npossibility seems remote given the stark difference that\nwas thereby introduced into the otherwise similar texts of\n18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7844(h) and 924(c).\n   Even if the similarity of the original texts of the two\nstatutes might have supported an inference that both\nincluded an implicit relationship requirement, their cur-\nrent difference virtually commands the opposite inference.\nWhile the two provisions were initially identical, Congress\u2019\nreplacement of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d in the firearm stat-\nute with the phrase \u201cand in relation to,\u201d coupled with the\ndeletion of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d without any similar\nreplacement in the explosives statute, convinces us that\nCongress did not intend to introduce a relational require-\nment into the explosives provision, but rather intended us\nto accept the more straightforward reading of \u00a7844(h).\nSince respondent was carrying explosives when he vio-\nlated \u00a71001, he was carrying them \u201cduring\u201d the commis-\n6               UNITED STATES v. RESSAM\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsion of that felony. The statute as presently written re-\nquires nothing further.\n  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nreversed.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                Cite as: 553 U.

S. C.\n\u00a7844(h)(2). The Ninth Circuit interpreted the statute as\nrequiring a \u201crelation\u201d between the explosives-carrying and\nthe felony (here, making a false statement to a customs\nofficer), such that the explosives-carrying \u201c \u2018facilitated\u2019 \u201d\nor \u201caided\u201d the commission of the felony. 474 F. 3d 597,\n604 (2007). The Court interprets the statute to the con-\ntrary. It holds that the statute requires no more than a\n\u201ctemporal link\u201d between the explosives-carrying and the\nfelony, that is to say, the two need only have occurred at\nthe same time. See ante, at 3. I cannot agree with either\ninterpretation.\n                               I\n   My problem with the Court\u2019s interpretation is that it\nwould permit conviction of any individual who legally\ncarries explosives at the time that he engages in a totally\nunrelated felony. \u201cExplosives,\u201d the statute tells us, in-\ncludes not only obviously explosive material such as \u201cgun-\npowders\u201d and \u201cdynamite\u201d but also any \u201cchemical com-\npounds\u201d or \u201cmixture[s]\u201d or \u201cdevice[s]\u201d whose \u201cignition by\nfire, by friction, by concussion\u201d or other means \u201cmay cause\nan explosion.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7844(j). And that definition\n2                UNITED STATES v. RESSAM\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nencompasses such commonplace materials as kerosene,\ngasoline, or certain fertilizers. Moreover, the \u201ccarr[ying]\u201d\nto which the statute refers includes carrying that is oth-\nerwise legal. Further, the statute applies to the carrying\nof explosives during \u201cany\u201d federal felony, a category that\nranges from murder to mail fraud. See \u00a71111 (2000 ed.\nand Supp. V); \u00a71341 (2000 ed., Supp. V).\n   Consequently the Court\u2019s opinion brings within the\nstatute\u2019s scope (and would impose an additional manda-\ntory 10-year prison term upon), for example, a farmer\nlawfully transporting a load of fertilizer who intentionally\nmails an unauthorized lottery ticket to a friend, a hunter\nlawfully carrying gunpowder for shotgun shells who buys\nsnacks with a counterfeit $20 bill, a truckdriver lawfully\ntransporting diesel fuel who lies to a customs official about\nthe value of presents he bought in Canada for his family,\nor an accountant who engaged in a 6-year-long conspiracy\nto commit tax evasion and who, one day during that con-\nspiracy, bought gas for his lawnmower. In such instances\nthe lawful carrying of an \u201cexplosive\u201d has nothing whatso-\never to do with the unlawful felonies. I cannot imagine\nwhy Congress would have wanted the presence of totally\nirrelevant, lawful behavior to trigger an additional 10-year\nmandatory prison term.\n   The statute\u2019s language does not demand such an inter-\npretation. I agree with the majority that the word \u201cdur-\ning\u201d requires a \u201ctemporal link.\u201d See ante, at 3. But a\nstatement that uses the word \u201cduring\u201d may or may not\nimply other limitations as well, depending upon the con-\ntext in which the statement is made. Thus, when I tell a\nfriend from Puerto Rico, \u201cI wear gloves during Washing-\nton\u2019s winter,\u201d he does not think I mean baseball mitts.\nRather, I imply (and he understands) a relation or link\nbetween the gloves and the winter. When I say to a group\nof lawyers, \u201cI take notes during oral argument,\u201d I imply\n(and they understand) that the notes bear a relation to the\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlaw being argued. But when I say, \u201cI called my brother\nduring the day,\u201d I do not imply any particular relation\n(other than a temporal relation) between the day and the\nphone call. Context makes the difference.\n   Here, the statute\u2019s context makes clear that the statu-\ntory statement does not cover a \u201ccarr[ying]\u201d of explosives\nthat is totally unrelated to the \u201cfelony.\u201d The lengthy\nmandatory minimum sentence is evidence of what the\nstatute\u2019s legislative history separately indicates, namely\nthat Congress sought to criminalize and impose harsh\npenalties in respect to the \u201cintentional misuse of explo-\nsives,\u201d see H. R. Rep. No. 91\u20131549, p. 38 (1970) (emphasis\nadded) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). A person who lawfully\ncarries explosives while committing some other felony\ndoes not even arguably \u201cmisuse\u201d those explosives unless\nthe carrying has something to do with the other felony.\nNor in the absence of some such relationship is there any\nobvious reason to impose an additional mandatory 10-year\nsentence on a person who unlawfully carries explosives\nwhile committing some other felony.\n   Similar reasoning led the Ninth Circuit in 1985 to in-\nterpret a related statute, which punished the carrying of a\nfirearm \u201cduring\u201d the commission of a federal felony, as\nrequiring a significant relationship between the firearms-\ncarrying and the other felony. See United States v. Stew-\nart, 779 F. 2d 538. JUSTICE (then-Judge) KENNEDY recog-\nnized that \u201c \u2018Congress did not intend to penalize one who\nhappens to have a gun in his possession when he commits\nan entirely unrelated offense.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 540 (quoting United\nStates v. Moore, 580 F. 2d 360, 362 (CA9 1978)). In my\nview, that same reasoning should apply when we interpret\nthe explosives statute, which was originally modeled on\nthe firearms statute. See H. R. Rep., at 69 (the explosives\nstatute \u201ccarries over to the explosives area the stringent\nprovisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 relating to the\nuse of firearms and the unlawful carrying of firearms to\n4                UNITED STATES v. RESSAM\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncommit, or during the commission of a Federal felony\u201d).\n   I recognize that the language of the firearms statute\nnow differs from the language of the explosives statute in\nan important way. The firearms statute originally pun-\nished (with a 1-to-10-year sentence) a person who \u201ccarries\na firearm unlawfully during the commission of any [fed-\neral] felony.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2) (1964 ed., Supp. IV).\nIn 1984, Congress amended the firearms statute by pro-\nviding a mandatory minimum punishment of five years\nand by striking the word \u201cunlawfully.\u201d \u00a71005(a), 98 Stat.\n2138. When it did so, Congress also added to the statute\nspecific words of limitation, namely the words \u201cand in\nrelation to\u201d (so that the statute covered any person who\ncarried a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d the commis-\nsion of a \u201cfelony\u201d). Ibid.\n   The words \u201cin relation to\u201d do not appear in the explo-\nsives statute. But neither did those words appear in the\npre-1984 version of the firearms statute that was the\nsubject of the Ninth Circuit opinion in Stewart (yet the\nNinth Circuit nonetheless found an implicit relational\nrequirement). And the fact that these words now appear\nin the firearms statute but not the explosives statute\ncannot make the determinative difference.\n   The history of the firearms statute makes clear that the\nreason Congress added to that statute the words \u201cin rela-\ntion to\u201d has to do with Congress\u2019 decision to remove from\nthe firearms statute the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d. By removing\nthat word, Congress indicated that the firearms statute\nshould apply to \u201cpersons who are licensed to carry fire-\narms\u201d but who \u201cabuse that privilege by committing a\ncrime with the weapon.\u201d S. Rep. No. 98\u2013225, p. 314, n. 10\n(1983). At the same time, however, Congress believed that\nthe statute should not apply where the firearm\u2019s presence\n\u201cplayed no part in the crime, such as a gun carried in a\npocket and never displayed or referred to in the course of a\npugilistic barroom fight.\u201d Ibid.

There are strong reasons for thinking it did\nnot. Congress, after all, amended the explosives statute in\nresponse to the Department of Justice\u2019s express request to\n\u201cbring\u201d the explosives statute \u201cin line with\u201d the firearms\nstatute. See 131 Cong. Rec. 14166 (1985); see also 134\nCong. Rec. 32700 (1988) (statement of Sen. Biden) (noting\nthat the purpose of amending the explosives statute was to\n\u201cbring it in line with similar amendments [previously]\nadopted . . . with respect to the parallel offense of using or\ncarrying a firearm during the commission of federal of-\nfenses\u201d). Congress accordingly increased the mandatory\nminimum punishment to five years and struck the word\n\u201cunlawfully.\u201d See \u00a76474(b), 102 Stat. 4379\u20134380. If Con-\ngress, in neglecting to add the words \u201cin relation to,\u201d\nsought to create a meaningful distinction between the\nexplosives and firearms statutes, one would think that\nsomeone somewhere would have mentioned this objective.\n   Further, to read the two statutes differently would\nbreak the very parallel treatment of firearms and explo-\nsives that led Congress, at the Department of Justice\u2019s\nurging, to amend the explosives statute in the first place.\nIt would produce the peculiar and unfair results I previ-\nously mentioned. See supra, at 2. It would conflict with\nCongress\u2019 original rationale for enacting the explosives\nstatute (to punish the misuse of explosives). And it would\nrisk incoherent results: Why would Congress wish not to\npunish a policeman for carrying an unrelated revolver\nduring the commission of a felony, but then wish to punish\nthat same policeman for carrying unrelated gunpowder for\nunrelated bullets?\n   At the same time one can explain the absence of the\nwords \u201cin relation to\u201d in less damaging ways. The legisla-\n6                UNITED STATES v. RESSAM\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntive drafters of the explosives amendment may have as-\nsumed that prior judicial interpretation, (namely, United\nStates v. Stewart, 779 F. 2d 538) made the words \u201cin rela-\ntion to\u201d unnecessary. See Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575,\n580 (1978) (\u201cCongress is presumed to be aware of an ad-\nministrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to\nadopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute\nwithout change\u201d). Or, as the majority recognizes, the\nomission of the language may reflect simple drafting\ninadvertence. See ante, at 5.\n   I concede that the presence of a phrase in one statute\nand the absence of the same phrase in another related\nstatute can signal an intended difference in relative statu-\ntory scope. But that is not inevitably so. Cf. Russello v.\nUnited States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (noting only a pre-\nsumption that Congress has acted intentionally and pur-\nposely if it \u201cincludes particular language in one section of\na statute but omits it in another section of the same Act\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). And here the cir-\ncumstances that I have mentioned make this a case in\nwhich that linguistic fact is not determinative.\n   No more here than elsewhere in life can words alone\nexplain every nuance of their intended application. Con-\ntext matters. And if judges are to give meaningful effect\nto the intent of the enacting legislature, they must inter-\npret statutory text with reference to the statute\u2019s purpose\nand its history.\n   The Court, with its decision today, makes possible the\nstrange results I describe above precisely because it re-\nsolves the statutory interpretation question by examining\nthe meaning of just one word in isolation. In context,\nhowever, the language excludes from the statute\u2019s scope\ninstances in which there is no significant relation between\nthe explosives-carrying and the felony. A contextual\ninterpretation furthers Congress\u2019 original purpose, is less\nlikely to encourage random punishment, and is consistent\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwith the statute\u2019s overall history. As a result, like the\nNinth Circuit, I would read the statute as insisting upon\nsome (other than merely temporal) relationship between\nexplosives carrying and \u201cfelony.\u201d\n                              II\n   At the same time, I cannot agree with the Ninth Circuit\nthat the statute restricts the requisite relationship to one\nin which the carrying of the explosives \u201c \u2018facilitated\u2019 \u201d (or\n\u201caided\u201d) the felony. 474 F. 3d, at 604. In my view, the\nstatute must also cover a felony committed to facilitate the\ncarrying of explosives. Why should it matter in which\ndirection the facilitating flows? Either way, there is a\nrelation between the carrying of explosives and the other\nfelony. Either way, one might reasonably conclude that\nthe presence of the explosives will elevate the risks of\nharm that otherwise would ordinarily arise out of the\nfelony\u2019s commission. Either way, one might consider the\nexplosives \u201cmisused.\u201d Thus, I believe the statute applies\nif the felony, here, the making of a false statement to\na customs officer, facilitated or aided the carrying of\nexplosives. And I would remand the case for the Circuit\nto determine the presence or absence of that relevant\nrelation.\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n",

De Pue, Attorney Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for United States.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Respondent attempted to enter the United States by car ferry at Port Angeles, Washington. Hidden in the trunk of his rental car were explosives that he intended to detonate at the Los Angeles International Airport. After the ferry docked, respondent was questioned by a customs official, who instructed him to complete a customs declaration form; respondent did so, identifying himself on the form as a Canadian citizen (he is Algerian) named Benni Noris (his name is Ahmed Ressam). Respondent was then directed to a secondary inspection station, where another official performed a search of his car. The official discovered explosives and related items in the car's spare tire well.</p>\n<p>Respondent was subsequently convicted of a number of crimes, including the felony of making a false statement to a United States customs official in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (1994 ed., Supp. V) (Count 5) and carrying an explosive \"during the commission of that felony in violation of \u00a7 844(h)(2) (1994 ed.) (Count 9). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit set aside his conviction on Count 9 because it read the word \"during,\" as used in \u00a7 844(h)(2), to include a requirement that the explosive be carried \"in relation to\" the underlying felony. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796583\"><a href=\"/opinion/796583/united-states-v-ahmed-ressam-also-known-as-benni-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span> (2007). Because that construction of the statute conflicted with decisions of other Courts of Appeals, we granted certiorari.<sup>[1]</sup> 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 741, 169 L.Ed.2d 579 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The most natural reading of the relevant statutory text provides a sufficient basis for reversal. That text reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Whoever\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) uses fire or an explosive to commit any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) carries an explosive during the commission of any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the United States,</blockquote>\n<p>\"including a felony which provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1861</span> imprisonment for 10 years.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h).</p>\n<p>It is undisputed that the items hidden in respondent's car were \"explosives.\"<sup>[2]</sup> It is also undisputed that respondent was \"carr[ying]\" those explosives when he knowingly made false statements to a customs official, and that those statements violated \u00a7 1001 (1994 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>There is no need to consult dictionary definitions of the word \"during\" in order to arrive at the conclusion that respondent engaged in the precise conduct described in \u00a7 844(h)(2) (1994 ed.). The term \"during\" denotes a temporal link; that is surely the most natural reading of the word as used in the statute. Because respondent's carrying of the explosives was contemporaneous with his violation of \u00a7 1001, he carried them \"during\" that violation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The history of the statute we construe today further supports our conclusion that Congress did not intend to require the Government to establish a relationship between the explosive carried and the underlying felony. Congress originally enacted \u00a7 844(h)(2) as part of its \"Regulation of Explosives\" in Title XI of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 957. The provision was modeled after a portion of the Gun Control Act of 1968, \u00a7 102, 82 Stat. 1224, codified, as amended, at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The earlier statute mandated at least 1 and no more than 10 years' imprisonment for any person who \"carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the United States.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) (1964 ed., Supp. IV). Except for the word \"explosive\" in \u00a7 844(h)(2), instead of the word \"firearm\" in \u00a7 924(c)(2), the two provisions as originally enacted were identical.</p>\n<p>In 1984, Congress redrafted the firearm statute; it increased the penalties attached to the provision and, most significantly for our purposes, deleted the word \"unlawfully\" and inserted the words \"and in relation to\" immediately after the word \"during.\" \u00a7 1005(a), 98 Stat. 2138. Reviewing a conviction for an offense that was committed before the amendment but not decided on appeal until after its enactment, the Ninth Circuit held that the original version of the firearm statute had implicitly included the \"in relation to\" requirement that was expressly added while the case was pending on appeal. As then-Judge Kennedy explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The statute as written when Stewart committed the offense provided in pertinent part that it was a crime to `carr[y] a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any felony. . . .' 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) (1982). In 1984, Congress revised section 924(c) . . . . The 1984 amendment substituted for the word `during' the phrase `during <i>and in relation to.</i>' 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c) (West Supp.1985) (emphasis added). Our study of the legislative history of the amendment . . . indicates the `in relation to' language was not intended to create an element of the crime that did not previously exist, but rather was intended to make clear a condition already implicit in the statute. The legislative history reveals that because the amendment eliminated the requirement that the firearm be carried unlawfully, 18 U.S.C.A. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1862</span> \u00a7 924(c) (West Supp.1985), the `in relation to' language was added to allay explicitly the concern that a person could be prosecuted under section 924(c) for committing an entirely unrelated crime while in possession of a firearm. Though the legislative history does not say so expressly, it strongly implies that the `in relation to' language did not alter the scope of the statute. . . .\" <i>United States v. Stewart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462359\"><a href=\"/opinion/462359/united-states-v-richard-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 539-540 (1985) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Relying on that Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals in this case concluded that the explosives statute, like the firearm statute, implicitly included a requirement of a relationship between possession of the item in question and the underlying felony. Whatever the merits of the argument that \u00a7 924(c) as originally enacted contained a relational requirement, the subsequent changes to both statutes convince us that the Government's reading of \u00a7 844(h) as presently written is correct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In 1988, Congress enacted the \"Explosives Offenses Amendments,\" \u00a7 6474(b), 102 Stat. 4379, which modified the text of \u00a7 844(h). Those amendments increased the penalties for violating the provision, \u00a7 6474(b)(2), <i>id.,</i> at 4380; they also deleted the word \"unlawfully,\" \u00a7 6474(b)(1), <i>ibid.</i> Unlike its earlier amendment to the firearm statute, however, Congress did not also insert the words \"and in relation to\" after the word \"during.\" While it is possible that this omission was inadvertent, that possibility seems remote given the stark difference that was thereby introduced into the otherwise similar texts of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 844(h) and 924(c).</p>\n<p>Even if the similarity of the original texts of the two statutes might have supported an inference that both included an implicit relationship requirement, their current difference virtually commands the opposite inference. While the two provisions were initially identical, Congress' replacement of the word \"unlawfully\" in the firearm statute with the phrase \"and in relation to,\" coupled with the deletion of the word \"unlawfully\" without any similar replacement in the explosives statute, convinces us that Congress did not intend to introduce a relational requirement into the explosives provision, but rather intended us to accept the more straightforward reading of \u00a7 844(h). Since respondent was carrying explosives when he violated \u00a7 1001, he was carrying them \"during\" the commission of that felony. The statute as presently written requires nothing further.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice SCALIA joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Because the plain language of the statute squarely answers the question presented in this case, I join only Part I of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The statute before us imposes a mandatory 10-year sentence on any person who \"carries an explosive during the commission of any [federal] felony.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h)(2). The Ninth Circuit interpreted the statute as requiring a \"relation\" between the explosives-carrying and the felony (here, making a false statement to a customs officer), such that the explosives-carrying \"`facilitated'\" or \"aided\" the commission of the felony. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796583\"><a href=\"/opinion/796583/united-states-v-ahmed-ressam-also-known-as-benni-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span>, 604 (2007). The Court interprets the statute to the contrary. It holds that the statute requires no more than a \"temporal link\" between the explosives-carrying and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1863</span> the felony, that is to say, the two need only have occurred at the same time. See <i>ante,</i> at 1861. I cannot agree with either interpretation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>My problem with the Court's interpretation is that it would permit conviction of any individual who legally carries explosives at the time that he engages in a totally unrelated felony. \"Explosives,\" the statute tells us, includes not only obviously explosive material such as \"gunpowders\" and \"dynamite\" but also any \"chemical compounds\" or \"mixture[s]\" or \"device[s]\" whose \"ignition by fire, by friction, by concussion\" or other means \"may cause an explosion.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(j). And that definition encompasses such commonplace materials as kerosene, gasoline, or certain fertilizers. Moreover, the \"carr[ying]\" to which the statute refers includes carrying that is otherwise legal. Further, the statute applies to the carrying of explosives during \"any\" federal felony, a category that ranges from murder to mail fraud. See \u00a7 1111 (2000 ed. and Supp. V); \u00a7 1341 (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>Consequently the Court's opinion brings within the statute's scope (and would impose an additional mandatory 10-year prison term upon), for example, a farmer lawfully transporting a load of fertilizer who intentionally mails an unauthorized lottery ticket to a friend, a hunter lawfully carrying gunpowder for shotgun shells who buys snacks with a counterfeit $20 bill, a truckdriver lawfully transporting diesel fuel who lies to a customs official about the value of presents he bought in Canada for his family, or an accountant who engaged in a 6-year-long conspiracy to commit tax evasion and who, one day during that conspiracy, bought gas for his lawnmower. In such instances the lawful carrying of an \"explosive\" has <i>nothing whatsoever</i> to do with the unlawful felonies. I cannot imagine why Congress would have wanted the presence of totally irrelevant, lawful behavior to trigger an additional 10-year mandatory prison term.</p>\n<p>The statute's language does not demand such an interpretation. I agree with the majority that the word \"during\" requires a \"temporal link.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 1861. But a statement that uses the word \"during\" may or may not imply <i>other</i> limitations as well, depending upon the context in which the statement is made. Thus, when I tell a friend from Puerto Rico, \"I wear gloves during Washington's winter,\" he does not think I mean baseball mitts. Rather, I imply (and he understands) a relation or link between the gloves and the winter. When I say to a group of lawyers, \"I take notes during oral argument,\" I imply (and they understand) that the notes bear a relation to the law being argued. But when I say, \"I called my brother during the day,\" I do not imply any particular relation (other than a temporal relation) between the day and the phone call. Context makes the difference.</p>\n<p>Here, the statute's context makes clear that the statutory statement does not cover a \"carr[ying]\" of explosives that is totally unrelated to the \"felony.\" The lengthy mandatory minimum sentence is evidence of what the statute's legislative history separately indicates, namely that Congress sought to criminalize and impose harsh penalties in respect to the \"intentional <i>misuse</i> of explosives,\" see H.R.Rep. No. 91-1549, p. 38 (1970), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1970, pp. 4007, 4013 (emphasis added) (hereinafter H.R. Rep.). A person who <i>lawfully</i> carries explosives while committing some other felony does not even arguably \"misuse\" those explosives unless the carrying has something to do with the other felony. Nor in the absence of some such relationship is there any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1864</span> obvious reason to impose an additional mandatory 10-year sentence on a person who <i>unlawfully</i> carries explosives while committing some other felony.</p>\n<p>Similar reasoning led the Ninth Circuit in 1985 to interpret a related statute, which punished the carrying of a <i>firearm</i> \"during\" the commission of a federal felony, as requiring a significant relationship between the firearms-carrying and the other felony. See <i>United States v. Stewart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462359\"><a href=\"/opinion/462359/united-states-v-richard-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>. Justice (then-Judge) KENNEDY recognized that \"`Congress did not intend to penalize one who happens to have a gun in his possession when he commits an entirely unrelated offense.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 540 (quoting <i>United States v. Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358227\"><a href=\"/opinion/358227/united-states-v-ernest-gene-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">580</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span>, 362 (C.A.9 1978)). In my view, that same reasoning should apply when we interpret the explosives statute, which was originally modeled on the firearms statute. See H.R. Rep., at 69, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1970, pp. 4007, 4046 (the explosives statute \"carries over to the explosives area the stringent provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 relating to the use of firearms and the unlawful carrying of firearms to commit, or during the commission of a Federal felony\").</p>\n<p>I recognize that the language of the firearms statute now differs from the language of the explosives statute in an important way. The firearms statute originally punished (with a 1-to-10-year sentence) a person who \"carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any [federal] felony.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) (1964 ed., Supp. IV). In 1984, Congress amended the firearms statute by providing a mandatory minimum punishment of five years and by striking the word \"unlawfully.\" \u00a7 1005(a), 98 Stat. 2138. When it did so, Congress also added to the statute specific words of limitation, namely the words \"and in relation to\" (so that the statute covered any person who carried a firearm \"during and in relation to\" the commission of a \"felony\"). <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The words \"in relation to\" do not appear in the explosives statute. But neither did those words appear in the pre-1984 version of the firearms statute that was the subject of the Ninth Circuit opinion in <i>Stewart</i> (yet the Ninth Circuit nonetheless found an implicit relational requirement). And the fact that these words now appear in the firearms statute but not the explosives statute cannot make the determinative difference.</p>\n<p>The history of the firearms statute makes clear that the reason Congress added to that statute the words \"in relation to\" has to do with Congress' decision to remove from the firearms statute the word \"unlawfully\". By removing that word, Congress indicated that the firearms statute should apply to \"persons who are licensed to carry firearms\" but who \"abuse that privilege by committing a crime with the weapon.\" S.Rep. No. 98-225, p. 314, n. 10 (1984), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1984, pp. 3182, 3492. At the same time, however, Congress believed that the statute should not apply where the firearm's presence \"played no part in the crime, such as a gun carried in a pocket and never displayed or referred to in the course of a pugilistic barroom fight.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The addition of the words \"in relation to\" made this dual objective textually clear.</p>\n<p>The absence of the words \"in relation to\" here must lead us to ask (but it does not answer) the question: Did Congress intend something different in respect to the explosives statute? There are strong reasons for thinking it did not. Congress, after all, amended the explosives statute in response to the Department of Justice's express request to \"bring\" the explosives statute \"in line with\" the firearms statute. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1865</span> See 131 Cong. Rec. 14166 (1985); see also 134 Cong. Rec. 32700 (1988) (statement of Sen. Biden) (noting that the purpose of amending the explosives statute was to \"bring it in line with similar amendments [previously] adopted . . . with respect to the parallel offense of using or carrying a firearm during the commission of federal offenses\"). Congress accordingly increased the mandatory minimum punishment to five years and struck the word \"unlawfully.\" See \u00a7 6474(b), 102 Stat. 4379-4380. If Congress, in neglecting to add the words \"in relation to,\" sought to create a meaningful distinction between the explosives and firearms statutes, one would think that someone somewhere would have mentioned this objective.</p>\n<p>Further, to read the two statutes differently would break the very parallel treatment of firearms and explosives that led Congress, at the Department of Justice's urging, to amend the explosives statute in the first place. It would produce the peculiar and unfair results I previously mentioned. See <i>supra,</i> at 1860. It would conflict with Congress' original rationale for enacting the explosives statute (to punish the <i>misuse</i> of explosives). And it would risk incoherent results: Why would Congress wish not to punish a policeman for carrying an unrelated revolver during the commission of a felony, but then wish to punish that same policeman for carrying unrelated gunpowder for unrelated bullets?</p>\n<p>At the same time one can explain the absence of the words \"in relation to\" in less damaging ways. The legislative drafters of the explosives amendment may have assumed that prior judicial interpretation, (namely, <i>United States v. Stewart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462359\"><a href=\"/opinion/462359/united-states-v-richard-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>) made the words \"in relation to\" unnecessary. See <i>Lorillard v. Pons,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109777\"><a href=\"/opinion/109777/lorillard-v-pons/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 580, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978) (\"Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change\"). Or, as the majority recognizes, the omission of the language may reflect simple drafting inadvertence. See <i>ante,</i> at 1862.</p>\n<p>I concede that the presence of a phrase in one statute and the absence of the same phrase in another related statute can signal an intended difference in relative statutory scope. But that is not inevitably so. Cf. <i>Russello v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (noting only a <i>presumption</i> that Congress has acted intentionally and purposely if it \"includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). And here the circumstances that I have mentioned make this a case in which that linguistic fact is not determinative.</p>\n<p>No more here than elsewhere in life can words alone explain every nuance of their intended application. Context matters. And if judges are to give meaningful effect to the intent of the enacting legislature, they must interpret statutory text with reference to the statute's purpose and its history.</p>\n<p>The Court, with its decision today, makes possible the strange results I describe above precisely because it resolves the statutory interpretation question by examining the meaning of just one word in isolation. In context, however, the language excludes from the statute's scope instances in which there is no significant relation between the explosives-carrying and the felony. A contextual interpretation furthers Congress' original purpose, is less likely to encourage random punishment, and is consistent with the statute's overall history. As a result, like the Ninth Circuit, I would read the statute as insisting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1866</span> upon some (other than merely temporal) relationship between explosives carrying and \"felony.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>At the same time, I cannot agree with the Ninth Circuit that the statute restricts the requisite relationship to one in which the carrying of the explosives \"`facilitated'\" (or \"aided\") the <i>felony.</i> 474 F.3d, at 604. In my view, the statute must also cover a felony committed to facilitate the <i>carrying of explosives.</i> Why should it matter in which direction the facilitating flows? Either way, there is a relation between the carrying of explosives and the other felony. Either way, one might reasonably conclude that the presence of the explosives will elevate the risks of harm that otherwise would ordinarily arise out of the felony's commission. Either way, one might consider the explosives \"misused.\" Thus, I believe the statute applies if the felony, here, the making of a false statement to a customs officer, facilitated or aided the carrying of explosives. And I would remand the case for the Circuit to determine the presence or absence of that relevant relation.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Both the Third and Fifth Circuits have declined to interpret \u00a7 844(h)(2) as requiring that the explosive be carried in relation to the underlying felony. See <i>United States v. Rosenberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480353\"><a href=\"/opinion/480353/united-states-v-rosenberg-susan-lisa-appeal-of-sus/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span>, 1178-1179 (C.A.3 1986) (\"The plain everyday meaning of `during' is `at the same time' or `at a point in the course of....' It does not normally mean `at the same time and in connection with.....' It is not fitting for this court to declare that the crime defined by \u00a7 844(h)(2) has more elements than those enumerated on the face of the statute\"); <i>United States v. Ivy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558049\"><a href=\"/opinion/558049/united-states-v-charles-ivy/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 151 (C.A.5 1991) (\"Section 844(h)(2) ... does not include the relation element Ivy urges .... We ... refuse to judicially append the relation element to \u00a7 844(h)(2)\").</p>\n<p>[2]  Because respondent concedes that the items in his car were \"explosives,\" we have no occasion to determine the boundaries of that term as used in the statute. Specifically, we do not comment on when, if ever, \"such commonplace materials as kerosene, gasoline, or certain fertilizers,\" <i>post,</i> at 1863 (BREYER, J., dissenting), might fall within the definition of \"explosive.\"</p>\n\n</div>",
