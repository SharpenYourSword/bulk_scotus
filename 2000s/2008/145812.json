United States,</i> 501 U.S. 923, 933, 111 S.Ct. 2661, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1767</span> 115 L.Ed.2d 808 (1991). This case presents the question whether it suffices for counsel alone to consent to the magistrate judge's role in presiding over <i>voir dire</i> and jury selection or whether the defendant must give his or her own consent.</p>\n<p>Homero Gonzalez was charged in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on five felony drug offense counts. He is the petitioner here. At the outset of jury selection, the parties appeared before a Magistrate Judge. The Magistrate Judge asked the attorneys to approach the bench. After they complied, the Magistrate Judge said: \"I need to ask the parties at this time if they are going to consent to having the United States Magistrate Judge proceed in assisting in the jury selection of this case.\" App. 16. Petitioner's counsel responded: \"Yes, your Honor, we are.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Magistrate Judge asked if petitioner was present and if he needed an interpreter. Petitioner's counsel answered yes to both questions. Petitioner was not asked if he consented to the Magistrate Judge's presiding. The record does not permit us to infer this or even to infer that petitioner knew there was a right to be waived. The Magistrate Judge then supervised <i>voir dire</i> and jury selection. Petitioner made no objections to the Magistrate Judge's rulings or her conduct of the proceedings. A District Judge presided at the ensuing jury trial, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p>Petitioner appealed, contending, for the first time, that it was error not to obtain his own consent to the Magistrate Judge's presiding at <i>voir dire.</i> The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the convictions. The court concluded petitioner could not show the error was plain and, furthermore, there was no error at all. It held the right to have an Article III judge preside over <i>voir dire</i> could be waived by petitioner's counsel. 483 F.3d 390, 394 (2007). The Courts of Appeals differ on this issue. Compare <i>ibid.,</i> with <i>United States v. Maragh,</i> 174 F.3d 1202, 1206 (C.A.11 1999) (requiring personal and explicit consent from the defendant); see also <i>United States v. Desir,</i> 273 F.3d 39, 44 (C.A.1 2001) (magistrate judge may conduct jury selection unless the defendant or his attorney registers an objection). We granted certiorari. 551 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 32, 168 L.Ed.2d 809 (2007). We agree that there was no error and hold that petitioner's counsel had full authority to consent to the Magistrate Judge's role.</p>\n<p>The Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 631 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. V), permits district courts to assign designated functions to magistrate judges. For example, magistrate judges are authorized to: issue orders concerning release or detention of persons pending trial; take acknowledgments, affidavits, and depositions; and enter sentences for petty offenses. \u00a7 636(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). They also may hear and determine, when designated to do so, any pretrial matter pending before the district court, with the exception of certain specified motions. Magistrate judges may also conduct hearings and propose recommendations for those motions, applications for post-trial criminal relief, and conditions of confinement petitions. \u00a7 636(b)(1) (2000 ed.). If the parties consent, they may conduct misdemeanor criminal trials and civil trials. \u00a7\u00a7 636(a)(3) and (c)(1).</p>\n<p>The statutory provision of direct applicability in the present case is \u00a7 636(b)(3). It states: \"A magistrate judge may be assigned such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" The general, nonspecific terms of this paragraph, preceded by text that sets out permissible duties in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1768</span> more precise terms, constitute a residual or general category that must not be interpreted in terms so expansive that the paragraph overshadows all that goes before.</p>\n<p>In two earlier cases the Court considered the question of magistrate judges presiding over the jury selection process in felony trials. In <i>Gomez v. United States,</i> 490 U.S. 858, 109 S.Ct. 2237, 104 L.Ed.2d 923 (1989), the District Judge delegated the task of selecting a jury to a Federal Magistrate Judge. Defense counsel objected, but the objection was overruled. The Court noted that \"[a] critical limitation on [the magistrate judge's] expanded jurisdiction is consent,\" <i>id.,</i> at 870, 109 S.Ct. 2237, and held that presiding, over an objection, at the preliminary selection phase of a jury trial in felony cases is not among the additional duties that a magistrate judge may assume, <i>id.,</i> at 875-876, 109 S.Ct. 2237.</p>\n<p>In <i>Peretz v. United States, supra</i><i>,</i> the Court again considered whether a magistrate judge could preside over <i>voir dire</i> in a felony case. In that instance, however, defendant's counsel, upon being asked by the District Court at a pretrial conference (with the defendant present) if there was any objection to having jury selection before a magistrate judge, responded, \"`I would love the opportunity.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 925, 111 S.Ct. 2661. Defense counsel later advised the Magistrate Judge that the defendant consented to the process. The Court clarified that in a felony trial neither the Act nor Article III forbids supervision of <i>voir dire</i> by a magistrate judge if both parties consent. <i>Id.,</i> at 935-936, 111 S.Ct. 2661.</p>\n<p>Taken together, <i>Gomez</i> and <i>Peretz</i> mean that \"the additional duties\" the statute permits the magistrate judge to undertake include presiding at <i>voir dire</i> and jury selection provided there is consent but not if there is an objection. We now consider whether the consent can be given by counsel acting on behalf of the client but without the client's own express consent.</p>\n<p>At first reading it might seem that our holding here is dictated by the holding in <i>Peretz.</i> In <i>Peretz,</i> it would appear the accused was aware of the colloquy between the District Judge and defense counsel and the formal waiver before the Magistrate Judge. On this premise <i>Peretz</i> might be read narrowly to hold that a defendant may signal consent by failing to object; and indeed, the petitioner here seeks to distinguish <i>Peretz</i> on this ground. Brief for Petitioner 41-42. We decide this case, however, on the assumption that the defendant did not hear, or did not understand, the waiver discussions. This addresses what, at least in petitioner's view, <i>Peretz</i> did not. It should be noted that we do not have before us an instance where a defendant instructs the lawyer or advises the court in an explicit, timely way that he or she demands that a district judge preside in this preliminary phase.</p>\n<p>There are instances in federal criminal proceedings where the procedural requisites for consent are specified and a right cannot be waived except with a defendant's own informed consent. Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b), for example, the district court is required, as a precondition to acceptance of a guilty plea, to inform the defendant in person of the specified rights he or she may claim in a full criminal trial and then verify that the plea is voluntary by addressing the defendant. The requirement is satisfied by a colloquy between judge and defendant, reviewing all of the rights listed in Rule 11.</p>\n<p>Statutes may also address this subject. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(b), for example, a magistrate judge may preside over the whole trial and sentencing in a misdemeanor case but only with the express, personal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1769</span> consent of the defendant. The provision requires that the magistrate judge</p>\n<blockquote>\"carefully explain to the defendant that he has a right to trial, judgment, and sentencing by a district judge and that he may have a right to trial by jury before a district judge or magistrate judge. The magistrate judge may not proceed to try the case unless the defendant, after such explanation, expressly consents to be tried before the magistrate judge and expressly and specifically waives trial, judgment, and sentencing by a district judge. Any such consent and waiver shall be made in writing or orally on the record.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The controlling statute in this case has a different design, however. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(3) does not state that consent to preside over felony <i>voir dire</i> must be granted by following a procedure of similar clarity. As a general matter, where there is a full trial there are various points in the pretrial and trial process when rights either can be asserted or waived; and there is support in our cases for concluding that some of these rights cannot be waived absent the defendant's own consent. Whether the personal consent must be explicit and on the record or can be determined from a course of conduct may be another matter, but for now it suffices to note that we have acknowledged that some rights cannot be waived by the attorney alone. See <i>New York v. Hill,</i> 528 U.S. 110, 114-115, 120 S.Ct. 659, 145 L.Ed.2d 560 (2000).</p>\n<p>Citing some of our precedents on point, the Court in <i>Hill</i> gave this capsule discussion:</p>\n<blockquote>\"What suffices for waiver depends on the nature of the right at issue. `[W]hether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver; and whether the defendant's choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake.' <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). For certain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an informed waiver. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Zerbst,</i> 304 U.S. 458, 464-465, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938) (right to counsel); <i>Brookhart v. Janis,</i> 384 U.S. 1, 7-8, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966) (right to plead not guilty). For other rights, however, waiver may be effected by action of counsel. `Although there are basic rights that the attorney cannot waive without the fully informed and publicly acknowledged consent of the client, the lawyer has\u0097and must have\u0097 full authority to manage the conduct of the trial.' <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> 484 U.S. 400, 417-418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988). As to many decisions pertaining to the conduct of the trial, the defendant is `deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent and is considered to have \"notice of all facts, notice of which can be charged upon the attorney.\"' <i>Link v. Wabash R. Co.,</i> 370 U.S. 626, 634, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (quoting <i>Smith v. Ayer,</i> 101 U.S. 320, 326, 25 L.Ed. 955 (1880)). Thus, decisions by counsel are generally given effect as to what arguments to pursue, see <i>Jones v. Barnes,</i> 463 U.S. 745, 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983), what evidentiary objections to raise, see <i>Henry v. Mississippi,</i> 379 U.S. 443, 451, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965), and what agreements to conclude regarding the admission of evidence, see <i>United States v. McGill,</i> 11 F.3d 223, 226-227 (C.A.1 1993). Absent a demonstration of ineffectiveness, counsel's word on such matters is the last.\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The issue in <i>Hill</i> was whether the attorney, acting without indication of particular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1770</span> consent from his client, could waive his client's statutory right to a speedy trial pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. The Court held that the attorney's statement, without any showing of the client's explicit consent, could waive the speedy trial right: \"Scheduling matters are plainly among those for which agreement by counsel generally controls.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 115, 120 S.Ct. 659.</p>\n<p>Giving the attorney control of trial management matters is a practical necessity. \"The adversary process could not function effectively if every tactical decision required client approval.\" <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> 484 U.S. 400, 418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988). The presentation of a criminal defense can be a mystifying process even for well-informed laypersons. This is one of the reasons for the right to counsel. See <i>Powell v. Alabama,</i> 287 U.S. 45, 68-69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Defense Function 4-5.2, Commentary, p. 202 (3d ed. 1993) (\"Many of the rights of an accused, including constitutional rights, are such that only trained experts can comprehend their full significance, and an explanation to any but the most sophisticated client would be futile\"). Numerous choices affecting conduct of the trial, including the objections to make, the witnesses to call, and the arguments to advance, depend not only upon what is permissible under the rules of evidence and procedure but also upon tactical considerations of the moment and the larger strategic plan for the trial. These matters can be difficult to explain to a layperson; and to require in all instances that they be approved by the client could risk compromising the efficiencies and fairness that the trial process is designed to promote. In exercising professional judgment, moreover, the attorney draws upon the expertise and experience that members of the bar should bring to the trial process. In most instances the attorney will have a better understanding of the procedural choices than the client; or at least the law should so assume. See <i>Jones v. Barnes,</i> 463 U.S. 745, 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983); see also <i>Tollett v. Henderson,</i> 411 U.S. 258, 267-268, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); cf. ABA Standards, <i>supra,</i> at 202 (\"Every experienced advocate can recall the disconcerting experience of trying to conduct the examination of a witness or follow opposing arguments or the judge's charge while the client `plucks at the attorney's sleeve' offering gratuitous suggestions\"). To hold that every instance of waiver requires the personal consent of the client himself or herself would be impractical.</p>\n<p>Similar to the scheduling matter in <i>Hill,</i> acceptance of a magistrate judge at the jury selection phase is a tactical decision that is well suited for the attorney's own decision. Under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the presiding judge has significant discretion over the structure of <i>voir dire.</i> The judge may ask questions of the jury pool or, as in this case, allow the attorneys for the parties to do so. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 24(a); App. 20. A magistrate judge's or a district judge's particular approach to <i>voir dire</i> both in substance\u0097the questions asked\u0097 and in tone\u0097formal or informal\u0097may be relevant in light of the attorney's own approach. The attorney may decide whether to accept the magistrate judge based in part on these factors. As with other tactical decisions, requiring personal, on-the-record approval from the client could necessitate a lengthy explanation the client might not understand at the moment and that might distract from more pressing matters as the attorney seeks to prepare the best defense. For these reasons we conclude that express consent by counsel suffices to permit a magistrate judge to preside over jury selection in a felony trial, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1771</span> pursuant to the authorization in \u00a7 636(b)(3).</p>\n<p>Our holding is not inconsistent with reading other precedents to hold that some basic trial choices are so important that an attorney must seek the client's consent in order to waive the right. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Florida v. Nixon,</i> 543 U.S. 175, 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004) (identifying the choices \"`to plead guilty, waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or take an appeal'\" as examples (quoting <i>Jones, supra,</i> at 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308)). Petitioner argues that the decision to have a magistrate judge rather than an Article III judge preside at jury selection is a fundamental choice, cf. <i>Hill,</i> 528 U.S., at 114, 120 S.Ct. 659, or, at least, raises a question of constitutional significance so that we should interpret the Act to require an explicit personal statement of consent before the magistrate judge can proceed with jury selection.</p>\n<p>We conclude otherwise. Under the avoidance canon, \"when `a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.'\" <i>Harris v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 545, 555, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (quoting <i>United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware &amp; Hudson Co.,</i> 213 U.S. 366, 408, 29 S.Ct. 527, 53 L.Ed. 836 (1909)). The canon, however, does not apply unless there are \"serious concerns about the statute's constitutionality.\" <i>Harris, supra,</i> at 555, 122 S.Ct. 2406; see also <i>Reno v. Flores,</i> 507 U.S. 292, 314, n. 9, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993).</p>\n<p>Those concerns are not present here. Petitioner concedes that a magistrate judge is capable of competent and impartial performance of the judicial tasks involved in jury examination and selection. Reply Brief for Petitioner 12-13; see also <i>Peretz,</i> 501 U.S., at 935, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (\"The Act evinces a congressional belief that magistrates are well qualified to handle matters of similar importance to jury selection\"). The Act contains some features to ensure impartiality. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 631(i) (establishing requirements for removal), 632 (limiting concurrent employment), 634(b) (providing salary protection during the term). And \"`the district judge\u0097insulated by life tenure and irreducible salary\u0097is waiting in the wings, fully able to correct errors.'\" <i>Peretz, supra,</i> at 938, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (quoting <i>United States v. Raddatz,</i> 447 U.S. 667, 686, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980) (Blackmun, J., concurring)). Here petitioner made no objections to the rulings by the Magistrate Judge. Had objections been made, nothing in the record or the rules indicates that the District Judge could not have ruled on the issues, all with no delay or prejudice to any trial that had commenced. See <i>Peretz, supra,</i> at 935, n. 12, 939, 111 S.Ct. 2661. These factors support our determination that consent of counsel suffices to allow a magistrate judge to supervise <i>voir dire.</i> This is not a case where the magistrate judge is asked to preside or make determinations after the trial has commenced and it is arguably difficult or disruptive for a district judge to review any objections that might have been made to the magistrate judge's rulings.</p>\n<p>Petitioner notes that <i>Peretz</i> considered supervision over entire civil and misdemeanor trials comparable to presiding over <i>voir dire</i> at a felony trial. 501 U.S., at 933, 111 S.Ct. 2661. It follows, he argues, that \u00a7 636(b)(3) must require, as does 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(b), express personal consent by the defendant before a magistrate judge may preside over <i>voir dire.</i> But it is not obvious that Congress would have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1772</span> thought these matters required the same form of consent. Aside from the fact that the statutory text is different, there are relevant differences between presiding over a full trial and presiding over <i>voir dire.</i> Were petitioner correct, one would think the Act would require at least the same form of consent to authorize a magistrate judge to preside over either a civil or a misdemeanor trial (which <i>Peretz</i> also deemed to be of comparable importance). Our interpretation of the Act indicates otherwise. Compare \u00a7 3401(b), with <i>Roell v. Withrow,</i> 538 U.S. 580, 590, 123 S.Ct. 1696, 155 L.Ed.2d 775 (2003) (concluding that parties may authorize a full-time magistrate judge to preside over a civil trial via implied consent).</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that our view of the issue should be informed by <i>Gomez's</i> conclusion that having a magistrate judge during jury selection without consent is structural error, not subject to harmless-error review. See 490 U.S., at 876, 109 S.Ct. 2237. The exemption of certain errors from harmless-error review \"recognizes that some errors necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair.\" <i>Rose v. Clark,</i> 478 U.S. 570, 577, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986); see also <i>id.,</i> at 577-578, 106 S.Ct. 3101. In petitioner's view, <i>Gomez</i> establishes that the issue in this case is of sufficient gravity or concern that personal consent must be required.</p>\n<p>The Court held in <i>Gomez</i> that imposition of a magistrate judge over objection was structural error, violating the basic right to a trial conducted at all critical stages by a judicial officer with appropriate jurisdiction. 490 U.S., at 876, 109 S.Ct. 2237. It does not follow, however, that this structural aspect requires an insistence on personal consent. Here, jurisdiction turns on consent; and for the reasons discussed above an attorney, acting on the client's behalf, can make an informed decision to allow the magistrate judge to exercise the jurisdiction Congress permits.</p>\n<p>Although a criminal defendant may demand that an Article III judge preside over the selection of a jury, the choice to do so reflects considerations more significant to the realm of the attorney than to the accused. Requiring the defendant to consent to a magistrate judge only by way of an on-the-record personal statement is not dictated by precedent and would burden the trial process, with little added protection for the defendant.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(3) a magistrate judge may preside over jury examination and jury selection only if the parties, or the attorneys for the parties, consent. Consent from an attorney will suffice. We do not have before us, and we do not address, an instance where the attorney states consent but the party by express and timely objection seeks to override his or her counsel. We need not decide, moreover, if consent may be inferred from a failure by a party and his or her attorney to object to the presiding by a magistrate judge. These issues are not presented here.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that no statute or rule requires that petitioner personally participate in the waiver of his right to have an Article III judge oversee <i>voir dire.</i> As to whether the Constitution requires that, the Court holds that it does not because it is a decision more tactical than fundamental\u0097\"more significant to the realm of the attorney than to the accused.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1772. I agree with the Court's conclusion, but not with the tactical-vs.-fundamental <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1773</span> test on which it is based.</p>\n<p>Petitioner and the Government do not dispute that petitioner's counsel consented to have a magistrate judge oversee <i>voir dire.</i> The issue is whether that consent\u0097 consent of counsel alone\u0097effected a valid waiver of petitioner's right to an Article III judge. It is important to bear in mind that we are not speaking here of action taken by counsel over his client's objection\u0097which would have the effect of revoking the agency with respect to the action in question. See <i>Brookhart v. Janis,</i> 384 U.S. 1, 7-8, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966). There is no suggestion of that. The issue is whether consent expressed by counsel alone is ineffective simply because the defendant himself did not express to the court his consent.</p>\n<p>I think not. Our opinions have sometimes said in passing that, under the Constitution, certain \"fundamental\" or \"basic\" rights cannot be waived unless a defendant personally participates in the waiver. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> 484 U.S. 400, 417-418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988); <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We have even repeated the suggestion in cases that actually involved the question whether a criminal defendant's attorney could waive a certain right\u0097but never in a case where the suggestion governed the disposition. In <i>New York v. Hill,</i> 528 U.S. 110, 120 S.Ct. 659, 145 L.Ed.2d 560 (2000), although we noted that \"[f]or certain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an informed waiver,\" <i>id.,</i> at 114, 120 S.Ct. 659, we in fact found such a requirement inapplicable; and even that determination can be viewed as resting upon an interpretation of the statute creating the right that counsel had waived, see <i>id.,</i> at 115, 120 S.Ct. 659. And in <i>Florida v. Nixon,</i> 543 U.S. 175, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004), although we said that \"counsel lacks authority to consent to a guilty plea on [his] client's behalf,\" <i>id.,</i> at 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, our holding was simply that counsel's concession of guilt to the jury did not amount to a guilty plea, <i>id.,</i> at 188, 125 S.Ct. 551, and did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, <i>id.,</i> at 192, 125 S.Ct. 551. As detailed in the margin, the decisions often cited for the principle of attorney incapacity are inapposite;<sup>[1]</sup> except <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1774</span> for one line of precedent, no decision of this Court holds that, as a constitutional matter, a defendant must personally waive certain of his \"fundamental\" rights\u0097which typically are identified as the rights to trial, jury, and counsel. The exceptional line of precedent involves the right to counsel. See <i>Johnson v. Zerbst,</i> 304 U.S. 458, 464-465, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). But that right is essentially <i>sui generis,</i> since an unrepresented defendant cannot possibly waive his right to counsel except in person. Cases involving that right therefore provide no support for the principle that the Constitution sometimes forbids attorney waiver.</p>\n<p>Since a formula repeated in dictum but never the basis for judgment is not owed <i>stare decisis</i> weight, see <i>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.,</i> 544 U.S. 528, 545-546, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876 (2005), our precedents have not established the rule of decision applicable in this case. I would not adopt the tactical-vs.-fundamental approach, which is vague and derives from nothing more substantial than this Court's say-so. One respected authority has noted that the approach has a \"potential for uncertainty,\" and that our precedents purporting to apply it \"have been brief and conclusionary.\" 3 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 11.6(a), (c), pp. 784, 796 (3d ed.2007). That is surely an understatement. What makes a right tactical? Depending on the circumstances, waiving <i>any</i> right can be a tactical decision. Even pleading guilty, which waives the right to trial, is highly tactical, since it usually requires balancing the prosecutor's plea bargain against the prospect of better and worse outcomes at trial.</p>\n<p>Whether a right is \"fundamental\" is equally mysterious. One would think that any right guaranteed by the Constitution would be fundamental. But I doubt many think that the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses cannot be waived by counsel. See <i>Diaz v. United States,</i> 223 U.S. 442, 444, 452-453, 32 S.Ct. 250, 56 L.Ed. 500 (1912). Perhaps, then, specification in the Constitution is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for \"fundamental\" status. But if something more is necessary, I cannot imagine what it might be. Apart from constitutional guarantee, I know of no objective criterion for ranking rights. The Court concludes that the right to have an Article III judge oversee <i>voir dire</i> is not a fundamental right, <i>ante,</i> at 1770-1772, without answering whether it is even a constitutional right,<sup>[2]</sup> and without explaining what makes a right fundamental in the first place. The essence of \"fundamental\" rights continues to elude.</p>\n<p>I would therefore adopt the rule that, as a constitutional matter, all waivable rights (except, of course, the right to counsel) can be waived by counsel. There is no basis in the Constitution, or as far as I am aware in common-law practice, for distinguishing in this regard between a criminal defendant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1775</span> and his authorized representative. In fact, the very notion of representative litigation suggests that the Constitution draws no distinction between them. \"A prisoner . . . who defends by counsel, and silently acquiesces in what they agree to, is bound as any other principal by the act of his agent.\" <i>People v. Rathbun,</i> 21 Wend. 509, 543 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1839). The <i>Rathbun</i> opinion, far from being the outlier view of a state court, was adopted as the common law position by eminent jurists of the 19th century, including Chief Justice Shaw of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. See <i>Commonwealth v. Dailey,</i> 66 Mass. 80, 83 (1853) (discussing <i>Rathbun</i> with approval in a case involving waiver of the right to a 12-man jury).</p>\n<p>It may well be desirable to require a defendant's personal waiver with regard to certain rights. Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, for example, provides that before accepting a guilty plea the court must \"address the defendant personally in open court,\" advise him of the consequences of his plea, and assure that the plea is voluntary. See also Rule 10(b) (waiver of right to appear at arraignment must be in writing signed by counsel and defendant). I do not contend that the Sixth Amendment's right to assistance of counsel prohibits such requirements of personal participation, at least where they do not impair counsel's expert assistance.</p>\n<p>Even without such rules it is certainly prudent, to forestall later challenges to counsel's conduct, for a trial court to satisfy itself of the defendant's personal consent to certain actions, such as entry of a guilty plea or waiver of jury trial, for which objective norms require an attorney to seek his client's authorization. See, <i>e.g.,</i> ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1.2(a) (2007) (\"In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client's decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify\"). But I know of no basis for saying that the <i>Constitution</i> automatically invalidates <i>any</i> trial action not taken by the defendant personally, though taken by his authorized counsel. I know of no way of determining, except by sheer prescription, which trial rights are <i>ex ante</i> and <i>by law</i> subject to such a limitation upon waiver. Assuredly the tactical-fundamental dichotomy does not do the trick. I would leave this matter of placing reasonable limits upon the right of agency in criminal trials to be governed by positive law, in statutes and rules of procedure.</p>\n<p>I would hold that petitioner's counsel's waiver was effective because no rule or statute provides that the waiver come from the defendant personally.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court holds today that neither the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 631 <i>et seq.,</i> nor the Constitution requires that a criminal defendant on trial for a felony personally give his informed consent before a magistrate judge may preside over jury selection. The Court proceeds from the premise, established in <i>Peretz v. United States,</i> 501 U.S. 923, 111 S.Ct. 2661, 115 L.Ed.2d 808 (1991), that the Federal Magistrates Act authorizes magistrate judges to preside over felony jury selection if the parties consent. I reject that premise, and for the reasons set forth below, would overrule <i>Peretz</i> and hold that the delegation of <i>voir dire</i> in this case was statutory error. I further conclude that the error may be corrected despite petitioner's failure to raise a timely objection in the District Court. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>This is the third time the Court has addressed the circumstances under which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1776</span> a district judge may delegate felony <i>voir dire</i> proceedings to a magistrate judge under the \"additional duties\" clause of the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(3). In <i>Gomez v. United States,</i> 490 U.S. 858, 109 S.Ct. 2237, 104 L.Ed.2d 923 (1989), the Court unanimously held that \u00a7 636(b)(3) does not authorize delegation of felony <i>voir dire</i> proceedings to a magistrate judge. Although the defendants in <i>Gomez</i> had objected to the delegation, neither the Court's reasoning nor its conclusion turned on that fact. Rather, the Court's interpretation of \u00a7 636(b)(3) rested primarily on two inferences drawn from the statutory scheme. First, the Court reasoned that Congress' \"carefully defined grant of authority to conduct trials of civil matters and of minor criminal cases should be construed as an implicit withholding of the authority to preside at a felony trial.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 872, 109 S.Ct. 2237. Second, the Court found it \"incongruous\" to assume that Congress intended felony jury selection to be among magistrate judges' additional duties but failed to provide an explicit standard of review as it had done for other duties described in the statute. <i>Id.,</i> at 874, 109 S.Ct. 2237. Neither of these inferences depended on the presence or absence of the parties' consent, and the Court's conclusion was accordingly unqualified: \"Congress . . . did not contemplate inclusion of jury selection in felony trials among a magistrate's additional duties.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 872, 109 S.Ct. 2237; see also <i>ibid.,</i> n. 25 (\"[W]e decide that the Federal Magistrates Act does not allow the delegation of jury selection to magistrates\"); <i>id.,</i> at 875-876, 109 S.Ct. 2237 (\"The absence of a specific reference to jury selection in the statute, or indeed, in the legislative history, persuades us that Congress did not intend the additional duties clause to embrace this function\" (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p>Two years later, the Court decided <i>Peretz.</i> Peretz's trial took place before this Court's decision in <i>Gomez,</i> and his attorney had agreed to the delegation of <i>voir dire,</i> assuring the Magistrate Judge that his client had consented. During the pendency of Peretz's appeal the Court decided <i>Gomez,</i> and Peretz argued that <i>Gomez</i> required reversal of his conviction. The Court of Appeals disagreed, concluding that he had waived any challenge to the Magistrate Judge's supervision of <i>voir dire.</i> Before this Court, the Government defended the Court of Appeals' holding as to waiver but confessed error with respect to the delegation of <i>voir dire,</i> \"agree[ing] with petitioner . . . that <i>Gomez</i> foreclose[d] the argument that the statute may be read to authorize magistrate-conducted voir dire when the defendant consents.\" Brief for United States in <i>Peretz v. United States</i><i>,</i> O.T.1990, No. 90-615, p. 9.</p>\n<p>Despite the Government's confession of error, the Court, \"[i]n an amazing display of interpretive gymnastics,\" <i>Peretz, supra,</i> at 940-941, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (Marshall, J., dissenting), held in a 5-to-4 decision that \u00a7 636(b)(3) does, after all, permit magistrate judges to conduct felony <i>voir dire</i> proceedings, so long as the parties consent. There is no need here to reproduce <i>Peretz's</i> flawed reasoning or to rehash the debate between the majority and dissenting opinions. Suffice it to say that, in my view, <i>Gomez</i> correctly interpreted \u00a7 636(b)(3) not to authorize delegation of felony jury selection regardless of the parties' consent, and I agree with the dissenters in <i>Peretz</i> that the Court's contrary conclusion in that case was based on a patently \"revisionist construction of the Act.\" 501 U.S., at 947, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (opinion of Marshall, J.).</p>\n<p>The only question, then, is whether to give <i>stare decisis</i> effect to <i>Peretz</i>'s erroneous conclusion that \u00a7 636(b)(3) authorizes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1777</span> magistrate judges to conduct felony jury selection if the parties consent. Although \"[i]t is true that we give stronger <i>stare decisis</i> effect to our holdings in statutory cases than in constitutional cases,\" that rule \"is not absolute, and we should not hesitate to allow our precedent to yield to the true meaning of an Act of Congress when our statutory precedent is `unworkable' or `badly reasoned.'\" <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U.S. 371, 401-402, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). <i>Peretz</i> is both. Two considerations in particular convince me that <i>Peretz</i> should be overruled.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>First, <i>Peretz</i> leaves the Court with no principled way to decide the statutory question presented in this case. Contrary to the Court's suggestion, the question presented here is not whether \"every instance of waiver requires the personal consent of the client,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1770; rather, it is the far narrower question whether \u00a7 636(b)(3) requires the defendant's personal consent before felony jury selection may be delegated to a magistrate judge. The Court answers this question in the negative, but does not point to anything in \u00a7 636(b)(3) or in the broader statutory scheme that supports its conclusion. It does not because it cannot. Not having provided for delegation of felony <i>voir dire</i> proceedings under the additional duties clause, Congress of course did not specify whether the parties' consent is required. And \"[b]ecause the additional duties clause contains no language predicating delegation of an additional duty upon litigant consent, it likewise contains nothing indicating what constitutes `consent' to the delegation of an additional duty.\" <i>Peretz, supra,</i> at 947, n. 6, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Congress' silence is particularly telling in the context of the Federal Magistrates Act. Elsewhere in the Act, Congress took great care to specify whether and in what manner the litigants must consent before a magistrate judge may assume significant duties. In \u00a7 636(c)(1), for example, Congress provided that full-time magistrate judges may conduct civil trials \"[u]pon the consent of the parties,\" and that part-time magistrate judges may do so \"[u]pon the consent of the parties, pursuant to their specific written request.\" Congress further provided in \u00a7 636(c)(2) that \"[t]he decision of the parties shall be communicated to the clerk of court,\" and, if the parties do not consent, the district judge may not raise the matter again without \"advis[ing] the parties that they are free to withhold consent without adverse substantive consequences.\" I have previously explained at length why \u00a7 636(c) is best read to require the express consent of the parties, see <i>Roell v. Withrow,</i> 538 U.S. 580, 591-597, 123 S.Ct. 1696, 155 L.Ed.2d 775 (2003) (dissenting opinion), and I will not repeat that discussion here, other than to point out that Congress obviously focused on the issue and gave detailed instructions regarding the form of the parties' consent.</p>\n<p>Even more telling is that Congress required the defendant's express, informed consent before a magistrate judge may conduct a misdemeanor trial. Section 636(a)(3) authorizes magistrate judges to conduct certain misdemeanor trials \"in conformity with and subject to the limitations of\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401, which spells out in detail the manner in which the defendant must consent:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The magistrate judge shall carefully explain to the defendant that he has a right to trial, judgment, and sentencing by a district judge and that he may have a right to trial by jury before a district judge or magistrate judge. The magistrate judge may not proceed to try the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1778</span> case unless the defendant, after such explanation, expressly consents to be tried before the magistrate judge and expressly and specifically waives trial, judgment, and sentencing by a district judge. Any such consent and waiver shall be made in writing or orally on the record.\" \u00a7 3401(b).</blockquote>\n<p>The Court recites the language of \u00a7 3401(b), but gives it no weight in its analysis. It recognizes that \"[t]here are instances in federal criminal proceedings where the procedural requisites for consent are specified and a right cannot be waived except with a defendant's own informed consent.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1768. But it is given no pause by the fact that the Federal Magistrates Act, the very statute it interprets to permit delegation of <i>felony</i> proceedings without the defendant's \"own informed consent,\" expressly requires such consent before a magistrate judge may conduct a <i>misdemeanor</i> trial. Instead, the Court worries that \"requiring personal, on-the-record approval from the client could necessitate a lengthy explanation the client might not understand at the moment and that might distract from more pressing matters,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1770, heedless of the fact that Congress plainly viewed any such \"burden[s] [on] the trial process,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1772, as outweighed by the need to obtain the defendant's personal consent before a magistrate judge may preside, even over a misdemeanor trial.</p>\n<p>The Court glides over this glaring anomaly, asserting that \"[t]he controlling statute in this case has a different design,\" and \"does not state that consent to preside over felony <i>voir dire</i> must be granted by following a procedure of similar clarity.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1769. But there is only one statute at issue here\u0097the Federal Magistrates Act expressly incorporates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(b)\u0097and the fact that it does not mandate \"a procedure of similar clarity\" for delegation of felony jury selection is hardly surprising, since \u00a7 636(b)(3)\u0097 which provides in its entirety that \"[a] magistrate judge may be assigned such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States\"\u0097says not a word about delegation of felony jury selection, much less about whether and in what form the parties must consent.</p>\n<p>The Court further suggests that \u00a7 3401(b) is inconsequential because \"there are relevant differences between presiding over a full trial and presiding over <i>voir dire.</i>\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1772. But even <i>Peretz</i> recognized that \"supervision of entire civil and misdemeanor trials\" is \"comparable in responsibility and importance to presiding over <i>voir dire</i> at a felony trial.\" 501 U.S., at 933, 111 S.Ct. 2661. And of course, it was Congress' omission of any mode of consent for delegation of felony proceedings, in contradistinction to its detailed treatment of the consent required for delegation of civil and misdemeanor trials, that drove <i>Gomez's</i> analysis. 490 U.S., at 872, 109 S.Ct. 2237 (\"[T]he carefully defined grant of authority to conduct trials of civil matters and of minor criminal cases should be construed as an implicit withholding of the authority to preside at a felony trial\"); see also <i>Peretz, supra,</i> at 955, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"By specifically authorizing magistrates to perform duties in civil and misdemeanor trials, and specifying the manner in which parties were to express their consent in those situations, the statute suggested <i>absence</i> of authority to preside over felony trials through some (unspecified) mode of consent\"). Today's decision is truly an ironic reversal. The Court once thought that Congress' differential treatment of felony jury selection and misdemeanor trials was a reason to believe that Congress had <i>entirely withheld</i> authority to preside over felony jury selection. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1779</span> Today, however, the Court says that the \"relevant differences\" between these responsibilities support the conclusion that Congress permitted delegation of felony jury selection upon a <i>lesser showing</i> of consent than that required for delegation of a misdemeanor trial.</p>\n<p>In the end, I am sympathetic to petitioner's argument that \u00a7 636(b)(3) should be read <i>in pari materia</i> with \u00a7 3401(b). See Brief for Petitioner 38 (\"If, in enacting the [Federal Magistrates Act] Congress believed a defendant's explicit, personal consent was constitutionally necessary to bestow authority upon a magistrate judge in federal misdemeanor cases, then <i>a fortiori</i> Congress would have believed that such explicit, personal consent is necessary to permit a magistrate judge to conduct felony jury selection\"). And I share his view that Congress undoubtedly would have adopted something akin to \u00a7 3401(b)'s requirements had it authorized delegation of felony jury selection. See <i>Peretz, supra,</i> at 947, n. 6, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\"I would think, however, that the standard governing a party's consent to delegation of a portion of a felony trial under the additional duties clause should be at least as strict as that governing delegation of a misdemeanor trial to a magistrate\").</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I do not believe that <i>Peretz's</i> erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 636(b)(3) gives me license to rewrite the Federal Magistrates Act to reflect what I think Congress would have done had it contemplated delegation of felony jury selection or foreseen the Court's decision in <i>Peretz.</i> Cf. Brief for Petitioner 33 (\"What the Court is left to do in petitioner's case is to fill the gap by determining what Congress would have done in enacting the [Federal Magistrates Act] had it expressly addressed the `crucial' consent issue\" (footnote omitted)). Where, as here, a mistaken interpretation of a statute leaves the Court with no principled way to answer subsequent questions that arise under the statute, it seems to me that the better course is simply to acknowledge and correct the error. Cf. <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, 578, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>A second reason why I would not give <i>stare decisis</i> effect to <i>Peretz</i> is that it requires us to wade into a constitutional morass. In <i>Gomez,</i> the Court declined to decide whether the Constitution permits delegation of felony jury selection to a magistrate judge. 490 U.S., at 872, n. 25, 109 S.Ct. 2237. <i>Peretz</i> simply brushed aside that difficult constitutional question. See 501 U.S., at 936, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (\"There is no constitutional infirmity in the delegation of felony trial jury selection to a magistrate when the litigants consent\"); cf. <i>id.,</i> at 948-952, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (discussing the \"serious constitutional question\" \"whether jury selection by a magistrate\u0097even when a defendant consents\u0097is consistent with Article III\"); <i>id.,</i> at 956, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (not resolving \"the serious and difficult constitutional questions raised by the [majority's] construction,\" but suggesting that the Court's reasoning rendered \"the doctrine of unconstitutional delegation\" \"a dead letter\").</p>\n<p>Today the Court's result requires it to go even further. In addition to reaffirming <i>Peretz's</i> questionable holding that the Constitution permits delegation of felony <i>voir dire</i> proceedings to a non-Article III judge, the Court decides that a criminal defendant's waiver of his right to an Article III judge need not be personal and informed. The Court treats this as an easy question, concluding that the choice between an Article III judge and a magistrate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1780</span> judge is not among those \"basic trial choices,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1771, that require a defendant's personal consent because \"a magistrate judge is capable of competent and impartial performance of the judicial tasks involved in jury examination and selection,\" and because magistrate judges are supervised by Article III judges, <i>ante,</i> at 1771, 1772. Under our precedents, however, the question is not so easily dispatched.</p>\n<p>Our cases shed little light on whether and when a criminal defendant must personally waive a constitutional right. Although we have previously stated that, \"[f]or certain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an informed waiver,\" <i>New York v. Hill,</i> 528 U.S. 110, 114, 120 S.Ct. 659, 145 L.Ed.2d 560 (2000), many of the cases we have cited for that proposition do not in fact stand for it. For example, we have cited <i>Brookhart v. Janis,</i> 384 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966), for the proposition that the defendant's personal consent is required for a waiver of his right to plead not guilty. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Hill, supra,</i> at 114, 120 S.Ct. 659. But <i>Brookhart's</i> holding was narrower. The only question presented there was \"whether counsel has power to enter a plea <i>which is inconsistent with his client's expressed desire</i> and thereby waive his client's constitutional right to plead not guilty and have a trial in which he can confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him.\" 384 U.S., at 7, 86 S.Ct. 1245 (emphasis added). <i>Brookhart</i> thus did not decide whether the Constitution prohibits counsel from entering a guilty plea on his client's behalf in cases where the defendant has not expressed a contrary desire.</p>\n<p>Similarly, <i>Patton v. United States,</i> 281 U.S. 276, 50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854 (1930), a case often cited for the proposition that the right to a jury trial can be waived only by the defendant personally, does not draw a clear distinction between the defendant's own consent and that of his attorney. The Court stated in dicta that \"the express and intelligent consent of the defendant\" is required \"before any waiver [of the right to a jury trial] can become effective.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 312, 50 S.Ct. 253. But that requirement appears to have been satisfied in <i>Patton</i> by counsel's representation to the trial court that he had conferred with his clients and obtained their consent. <i>Id.,</i> at 286-287, 50 S.Ct. 253.</p>\n<p>Our cases thus provide little relevant guidance. Justice SCALIA may well be correct that, as a matter of first principles, there is no right (other than perhaps the <i>sui generis</i> right to counsel) that cannot be waived by a defendant's attorney, acting as the duly authorized agent of his client. See <i>ante,</i> at 1768 (opinion concurring in judgment). But if I were to accept the Court's oft-repeated dictum that there are certain fundamental rights that can be waived only by the defendant personally, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Florida v. Nixon,</i> 543 U.S. 175, 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004) (\"[C]ertain decisions regarding the exercise or waiver of basic trial rights are of such moment that they cannot be made for the defendant by a surrogate\"); <i>Hill, supra,</i> at 114, 120 S.Ct. 659; <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> 484 U.S. 400, 417-418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988) (\"[T]here are basic rights that the attorney cannot waive without the fully informed and publicly acknowledged consent of the client\"), I see no reason why the right to an Article III judge should not be among them.</p>\n<p>There is no apparent reason, for example, why the right to an Article III judge should be deemed any less fundamental, or its exercise any more \"`tactical,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 1770 (opinion of the Court) (quoting <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 418, 108 S.Ct. 646), than the right to a jury trial. The Framers viewed independent judges, no less than the right to a jury of one's peers, as indispensable to a fair trial. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1781</span> <i>Hatter,</i> 532 U.S. 557, 568-569, 121 S.Ct. 1782, 149 L.Ed.2d 820 (2001) (discussing the Framers' overriding concern for an independent Judiciary and quoting Chief Justice Marshall's statement that the \"`greatest scourge . . . ever inflicted'\" \"`was an ignorant, a corrupt, or a dependent Judiciary'\" (quoting Proceedings and Debates of the Virginia State Convention, of 1829-1830, p. 619 (1830))). For that reason, the Constitution affords Article III judges the structural protections of life tenure and salary protection. Art. III, \u00a7 1. The Court's observation that \"a magistrate judge is capable of competent and impartial performance\" of judicial duties, <i>ante,</i> at 1772, is thus beside the point.<sup>[*]</sup> Magistrate judges do not enjoy the structural protections of Article III: They serve 8-year terms and may be removed for cause, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 631(e), (i), and they are subject to diminution of their salaries and outright abolition of their offices by Congress. Accordingly, whatever their virtues, magistrate judges are no substitute for Article III judges in the eyes of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>In short, if I accepted the Court's dictum that the right to a jury trial may be waived only by the defendant personally, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Nixon, supra,</i> at 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, I would be hard pressed to conclude that waiver of the right to an Article III judge during a critical stage of a felony trial requires anything less. That said, I include this brief discussion of the constitutional issues this case presents not because I would decide them, but to point out that the Court gives them short shrift. These are serious constitutional questions, see <i>Roell,</i> 538 U.S., at 595, 123 S.Ct. 1696 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), and they are posed only because of <i>Peretz</i>'s erroneous interpretation of the Federal Magistrates Act. Indeed, I suspect that Congress withheld from magistrate judges the authority to preside during felony trials precisely in order to avoid the constitutional questions <i>Peretz</i> now thrusts upon us. Again, rather than plow headlong into this constitutional thicket, the better choice is simply to overrule <i>Peretz.</i> Cf. <i>Peretz,</i> 501 U.S., at 952, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (finding the Court's resolution of difficult <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1782</span> Article III questions \"particularly unfortunate\" where \"the most coherent reading of the Federal Magistrates Act avoids these problems entirely\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Because I conclude that <i>Peretz</i> should be overruled, and that the District Court therefore erred in delegating <i>voir dire</i> to the Magistrate Judge, I must also address the Government's alternative argument that petitioner forfeited his claim by failing to object to the delegation. Petitioner's failure to object, the Government contends, means that he cannot prevail unless he satisfies the requirements of the plain-error rule. It is true that petitioner did not raise a timely objection to the District Court's delegation of <i>voir dire.</i> And petitioner cannot satisfy the plain-error rule because the statutory error below\u0097unauthorized delegation of <i>voir dire</i> to a magistrate judge\u0097was not \"plain\" under <i>Peretz.</i></p>\n<p>Not all uncontested errors, however, are subject to the plain-error rule. In limited circumstances, we have \"agreed to correct, at least on direct review, violations of a statutory provision that embodies a strong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial business even though the defect was not raised in a timely manner.\" <i>Nguyen v. United States,</i> 539 U.S. 69, 78, 123 S.Ct. 2130, 156 L.Ed.2d 64 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <i>Nguyen,</i> a non-Article III judge sat by designation on the Ninth Circuit panel that affirmed petitioners' convictions. Petitioners failed to object to the composition of the panel in the Ninth Circuit and raised the issue for the first time in their petitions for certiorari. Because the Ninth Circuit panel \"contravened the statutory requirements set by Congress for the composition of the federal courts of appeals,\" <i>id.,</i> at 80, 123 S.Ct. 2130, and because those requirements \"embodie[d] weighty congressional policy concerning the proper organization of the federal courts,\" <i>id.,</i> at 79, 123 S.Ct. 2130, we held that petitioners' failure to object did not preclude relief. We specifically declined to apply the plain-error rule:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It is true, as the Government observes, that a failure to object to trial error ordinarily limits an appellate court to review for plain error. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111; Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b). But to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners' part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld. Even if the parties had <i>expressly</i> stipulated to the participation of a non-Article III judge in the consideration of their appeals, no matter how distinguished and well qualified the judge might be, such a stipulation would not have cured the plain defect in the composition of the panel.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 80-81[, 123 S.Ct. 2130].</blockquote>\n<p>I see no reason to treat this case differently than <i>Nguyen.</i> Just as \"Congress' decision to preserve the Article III character of the courts of appeals [was] more than a trivial concern\" in that case, <i>id.,</i> at 80, 123 S.Ct. 2130, so too here Congress' decision to preserve the Article III character of felony trials \"embodies weighty congressional policy concerning the proper organization of the federal courts,\" <i>id.,</i> at 79, 123 S.Ct. 2130. Accordingly, as in <i>Nguyen,</i> the Court can and should correct the error in this case despite petitioner's failure to raise a timely objection below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  On the right to jury, <i>Thompson v. Utah,</i> 170 U.S. 343, 18 S.Ct. 620, 42 L.Ed. 1061 (1898), held, at most, that the right was not waivable. <i>Id.,</i> at 353-354, 18 S.Ct. 620. The Court later questioned whether <i>Thompson</i> even held that, and went on to hold that the right is waivable. See <i>Patton v. United States,</i> 281 U.S. 276, 293, 50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854 (1930). The observation at the end of <i>Patton</i> that \"before any waiver can become effective, the consent of government counsel and the sanction of the court must be had, in addition to the express and intelligent consent of the defendant,\" <i>id.,</i> at 312, 50 S.Ct. 253, was dictum; the <i>Patton</i> defendants had all agreed to the waiver, <i>id.,</i> at 286, 50 S.Ct. 253. Even less germane is <i>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann,</i> 317 U.S. 269, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942), which held only that an unrepresented defendant can waive his right to jury without the advice of counsel. <i>Id.,</i> at 278-279, 63 S.Ct. 236.\n</p>\n<p>On the right to trial, <i>Brookhart v. Janis,</i> 384 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966), held only that a defendant's expressed wish to proceed to trial must prevail over his attorney's contrary opinion. See <i>id.,</i> at 7-8, 86 S.Ct. 1245. Other decisions have said that waiver of the right to trial must be knowing and voluntary, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Brady v. United States,</i> 397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970), but waiver by counsel was not at issue in those cases. Even if, in the case of waiver by counsel, the knowing and voluntary requirement applies to the defendant himself, that still permits counsel to waive on behalf of an informed and agreeing client. Equally inapposite is <i>Boykin v. Alabama,</i> 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), which held that a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to trial cannot be inferred from a silent record. <i>Id.,</i> at 244, 89 S.Ct. 1709.</p>\n<p>[2]  We have avoided addressing whether the right has a basis in the Constitution. In <i>Gomez v. United States,</i> 490 U.S. 858, 109 S.Ct. 2237, 104 L.Ed.2d 923 (1989), we interpreted the Federal Magistrate Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(3), not to permit a magistrate judge to oversee <i>voir dire,</i> 490 U.S., at 875-876, 109 S.Ct. 2237, making it unnecessary to consider whether there was a constitutional right to have an Article III judge oversee <i>voir dire.</i> In <i>Peretz v. United States,</i> 501 U.S. 923, 111 S.Ct. 2661, 115 L.Ed.2d 808 (1991), we held that judicial overseeing of the <i>voir dire</i> had been waived, <i>id.,</i> at 936-937, 111 S.Ct. 2661, which obviated having to decide whether it was a constitutional right. See <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732-733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (waiver extinguishes the error of not complying with a legal rule).</p>\n<p>[*]  Equally beside the point is the fact that magistrate judges are appointed by, and subject to the supervision of, district judges. The Court reassures itself by hypothesizing that the District Court could have ruled on any objections to the Magistrate Judge's rulings. <i>Ante,</i> at 1771-1772. But the Court once \"harbor[ed] serious doubts\" that a district judge who was not present during jury selection could \"meaningfully\" review a magistrate judge's rulings, <i>Gomez v. United States,</i> 490 U.S. 858, 874, 109 S.Ct. 2237, 104 L.Ed.2d 923 (1989), because \"no transcript can recapture the atmosphere of the <i>voir dire,</i>\" <i>id.,</i> at 875, 109 S.Ct. 2237. The Court does not explain what has intervened to dispel those doubts. And even if district judges could meaningfully review magistrate judges' <i>voir dire</i> rulings, that would not change the fact that magistrate judges are subject to outside influences in ways that Article III judges are not. As Judge Posner has explained:\n</p>\n<p>\"The fact that the appointing power has been given to Article III judges is the opposite of reassuring. It makes magistrates beholden to judges as well as to Congress . . . . The Constitution built internal checks and balances into the legislative branch by making Congress bicameral and into the judicial branch by guaranteeing all federal judges\u0097 not just Supreme Court Justices, or appellate judges generally\u0097tenure during good behavior and protection against pay cuts. Appellate judges can reverse district judges, can mandamus them, can criticize them, can remand a case to another judge, but cannot fire district judges, cow them, or silence them\u0097 cannot prevent them from making independent judgments and expressing independent views. . . . [A]s long as [district judges] enjoy the tenure and compensation protections of Article III, they are independent of [those] who appointed them . . . . Magistrates do not have those protections; the judges control their reappointment.\" <i>Geras v. Lafayette Display Fixtures, Inc.,</i> 742 F.2d 1037, 1053 (C.A.7 1984) (dissenting opinion).</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued January 8, 2008\u2014Decided May 12, 2008\nIf the parties consent, a federal magistrate judge may preside over the\n   voir dire and jury selection in a felony criminal trial. Peretz v. United\n   States, 501 U. S. 923, 933. Before petitioner\u2019s federal trial on felony\n   drug charges, his counsel consented to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s presid-\n   ing over jury selection. Petitioner was not asked for his own consent.\n   After the Magistrate Judge supervised voir dire without objection, a\n   District Judge presided at trial, and the jury returned a guilty verdict\n   on all counts. Petitioner contended for the first time on appeal that it\n   was error not to obtain his own consent to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s\n   voir dire role. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the convictions, concluding,\n   inter alia, that the right to have a district judge preside over voir dire\n   could be waived by counsel.\nHeld: Express consent by counsel suffices to permit a magistrate judge\n to preside over jury selection in a felony trial, pursuant to the Federal\n Magistrates Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7636(b)(3), which states: \u201cA magistrate\n judge may be assigned such additional duties as are not inconsistent\n with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u201d Under Gomez\n v. United States, 490 U. S. 858, 870, 875\u2013876, and Peretz, supra, at\n 933, 935\u2013936, such \u201cadditional duties\u201d include presiding at voir dire\n if the parties consent, but not if there is an objection. Generally,\n where there is a full trial, there are various points at which rights ei-\n ther can be asserted or waived. This Court has indicated that some\n of these rights require the defendant\u2019s own consent to waive. See,\n e.g., New York v. Hill, 528 U. S. 110, 114\u2013115. The Court held in\n Hill, however, that an attorney, acting without indication of particu-\n lar consent from his client, could waive his client\u2019s statutory right to\n a speedy trial because \u201c[s]cheduling matters are plainly among those\n for which agreement by counsel generally controls.\u201d Ibid. Similar to\n2                    GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the scheduling matter in Hill, acceptance of a magistrate judge at the\n    jury selection phase is a tactical decision well suited for the attor-\n    ney\u2019s own decision. The presiding judge has significant discretion\n    over jury selection both as to substance\u2014the questions asked\u2014and\n    tone\u2014formal or informal\u2014and the judge\u2019s approach may be relevant\n    in light of the approach of the attorney, who may decide whether to\n    accept a magistrate judge based in part on these factors. As with\n    other tactical decisions, requiring personal, on-the-record approval\n    from the client could necessitate a lengthy explanation that the client\n    might not understand and that might distract from more pressing\n    matters as the attorney seeks to prepare the best defense. Petitioner\n    argues unconvincingly that the decision to have a magistrate judge\n    for voir dire is a fundamental choice, cf. Hill, supra, at 114, or, at\n    least, raises a question of constitutional significance so that the Act\n    should be interpreted to require explicit consent. Serious concerns\n    about the Act\u2019s constitutionality are not present here, and petitioner\n    concedes that magistrate judges are capable of competent and impar-\n    tial performance when presiding over jury selection.

Peretz v. United States,\n501 U. S. 923, 933 (1991). This case presents the question\nwhether it suffices for counsel alone to consent to the\nmagistrate judge\u2019s role in presiding over voir dire and jury\nselection or whether the defendant must give his or her\nown consent.\n   Homero Gonzalez was charged in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas on five\nfelony drug offense counts. He is the petitioner here. At\nthe outset of jury selection, the parties appeared before a\nMagistrate Judge. The Magistrate Judge asked the attor-\nneys to approach the bench. After they complied, the\nMagistrate Judge said: \u201cI need to ask the parties at this\ntime if they are going to consent to having the United\nStates Magistrate Judge proceed in assisting in the jury\nselection of this case.\u201d App. 16. Petitioner\u2019s counsel re-\nsponded: \u201cYes, your Honor, we are.\u201d Ibid. The Magistrate\nJudge asked if petitioner was present and if he needed an\n2              GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpreter. Petitioner\u2019s counsel answered yes to both\nquestions. Petitioner was not asked if he consented to the\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s presiding. The record does not permit\nus to infer this or even to infer that petitioner knew there\nwas a right to be waived. The Magistrate Judge then\nsupervised voir dire and jury selection. Petitioner made\nno objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s rulings or her\nconduct of the proceedings. A District Judge presided at\nthe ensuing jury trial, and the jury returned a verdict of\nguilty on all counts.\n   Petitioner appealed, contending, for the first time, that\nit was error not to obtain his own consent to the Magis-\ntrate Judge\u2019s presiding at voir dire. The United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the convic-\ntions. The court concluded petitioner could not show the\nerror was plain and, furthermore, there was no error at\nall. It held the right to have an Article III judge preside\nover voir dire could be waived by petitioner\u2019s counsel. 483\nF. 3d 390, 394 (2007). The Courts of Appeals differ on this\nissue. Compare ibid., with United States v. Maragh, 174\nF. 3d 1202, 1206 (CA11 1999) (requiring personal and\nexplicit consent from the defendant); see also United\nStates v. Desir, 273 F. 3d 39, 44 (CA1 2001) (magistrate\njudge may conduct jury selection unless the defendant or\nhis attorney registers an objection). We granted certiorari.\n551 U. S. ___ (2007). We agree that there was no error\nand hold that petitioner\u2019s counsel had full authority to\nconsent to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s role.\n   The Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7631 et seq.\n(2000 ed. and Supp. V), permits district courts to assign\ndesignated functions to magistrate judges. For example,\nmagistrate judges are authorized to: issue orders concern-\ning release or detention of persons pending trial; take\nacknowledgments, affidavits, and depositions; and enter\nsentences for petty offenses. \u00a7636(a) (2000 ed. and Supp.\nV). They also may hear and determine, when designated\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto do so, any pretrial matter pending before the district\ncourt, with the exception of certain specified motions.\nMagistrate judges may also conduct hearings and propose\nrecommendations for those motions, applications for post-\ntrial criminal relief, and conditions of confinement peti-\ntions. \u00a7636(b)(1) (2000 ed.). If the parties consent, they\nmay conduct misdemeanor criminal trials and civil trials.\n\u00a7\u00a7636(a)(3) and (c)(1).\n   The statutory provision of direct applicability in the\npresent case is \u00a7636(b)(3). It states: \u201cA magistrate judge\nmay be assigned such additional duties as are not incon-\nsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United\nStates.\u201d The general, nonspecific terms of this paragraph,\npreceded by text that sets out permissible duties in more\nprecise terms, constitute a residual or general category\nthat must not be interpreted in terms so expansive that\nthe paragraph overshadows all that goes before.\n   In two earlier cases the Court considered the question of\nmagistrate judges presiding over the jury selection process\nin felony trials. In Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858\n(1989), the District Judge delegated the task of selecting a\njury to a Federal Magistrate Judge. Defense counsel\nobjected, but the objection was overruled. The Court noted\nthat \u201c[a] critical limitation on [the magistrate judge\u2019s]\nexpanded jurisdiction is consent,\u201d id., at 870, and held\nthat presiding, over an objection, at the preliminary selec-\ntion phase of a jury trial in felony cases is not among the\nadditional duties that a magistrate judge may assume, id.,\nat 875\u2013876.\n   In Peretz v. United States, supra, the Court again con-\nsidered whether a magistrate judge could preside over voir\ndire in a felony case. In that instance, however, defen-\ndant\u2019s counsel, upon being asked by the District Court at a\npretrial conference (with the defendant present) if there\nwas any objection to having jury selection before a magis-\ntrate judge, responded, \u201c \u2018I would love the opportunity.\u2019 \u201d\n4               GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 925. Defense counsel later advised the Magistrate\nJudge that the defendant consented to the process. The\nCourt clarified that in a felony trial neither the Act nor\nArticle III forbids supervision of voir dire by a magistrate\njudge if both parties consent. Id., at 935\u2013936.\n   Taken together, Gomez and Peretz mean that \u201cthe addi-\ntional duties\u201d the statute permits the magistrate judge to\nundertake include presiding at voir dire and jury selection\nprovided there is consent but not if there is an objection.\nWe now consider whether the consent can be given by\ncounsel acting on behalf of the client but without the\nclient\u2019s own express consent.\n   At first reading it might seem that our holding here is\ndictated by the holding in Peretz. In Peretz, it would ap-\npear the accused was aware of the colloquy between the\nDistrict Judge and defense counsel and the formal waiver\nbefore the Magistrate Judge. On this premise Peretz\nmight be read narrowly to hold that a defendant may\nsignal consent by failing to object; and indeed, the peti-\ntioner here seeks to distinguish Peretz on this ground.\nBrief for Petitioner 41\u201342. We decide this case, however,\non the assumption that the defendant did not hear, or did\nnot understand, the waiver discussions. This addresses\nwhat, at least in petitioner\u2019s view, Peretz did not. It\nshould be noted that we do not have before us an instance\nwhere a defendant instructs the lawyer or advises the\ncourt in an explicit, timely way that he or she demands\nthat a district judge preside in this preliminary phase.\n   There are instances in federal criminal proceedings\nwhere the procedural requisites for consent are specified\nand a right cannot be waived except with a defendant\u2019s\nown informed consent. Under Federal Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 11(b), for example, the district court is required,\nas a precondition to acceptance of a guilty plea, to inform\nthe defendant in person of the specified rights he or she\nmay claim in a full criminal trial and then verify that the\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplea is voluntary by addressing the defendant. The re-\nquirement is satisfied by a colloquy between judge and\ndefendant, reviewing all of the rights listed in Rule 11.\n  Statutes may also address this subject. Under 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73401(b), for example, a magistrate judge may\npreside over the whole trial and sentencing in a misde-\nmeanor case but only with the express, personal consent of\nthe defendant. The provision requires that the magistrate\njudge\n    \u201ccarefully explain to the defendant that he has a right\n    to trial, judgment, and sentencing by a district judge\n    and that he may have a right to trial by jury before\n    a district judge or magistrate judge. The magistrate\n    judge may not proceed to try the case unless the de-\n    fendant, after such explanation, expressly consents to\n    be tried before the magistrate judge and expressly and\n    specifically waives trial, judgment, and sentencing by\n    a district judge. Any such consent and waiver shall be\n    made in writing or orally on the record.\u201d\n  The controlling statute in this case has a different de-\nsign, however. Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a7636(b)(3) does not state\nthat consent to preside over felony voir dire must be\ngranted by following a procedure of similar clarity. As a\ngeneral matter, where there is a full trial there are vari-\nous points in the pretrial and trial process when rights\neither can be asserted or waived; and there is support in\nour cases for concluding that some of these rights cannot\nbe waived absent the defendant\u2019s own consent. Whether\nthe personal consent must be explicit and on the record or\ncan be determined from a course of conduct may be an-\nother matter, but for now it suffices to note that we have\nacknowledged that some rights cannot be waived by the\nattorney alone. See New York v. Hill, 528 U. S. 110, 114\u2013\n115 (2000).\n  Citing some of our precedents on point, the Court in Hill\n6              GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngave this capsule discussion:\n       \u201cWhat suffices for waiver depends on the nature of\n    the right at issue. \u2018[W]hether the defendant must\n    participate personally in the waiver; whether certain\n    procedures are required for waiver; and whether the\n    defendant\u2019s choice must be particularly informed or\n    voluntary, all depend on the right at stake.\u2019 United\n    States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 733 (1993). For certain\n    fundamental rights, the defendant must personally\n    make an informed waiver. See, e.g., Johnson v.\n    Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464\u2013465 (1938) (right to coun-\n    sel); Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U. S. 1, 7\u20138 (1966) (right\n    to plead not guilty). For other rights, however, waiver\n    may be effected by action of counsel. \u2018Although there\n    are basic rights that the attorney cannot waive with-\n    out the fully informed and publicly acknowledged con-\n    sent of the client, the lawyer has\u2014and must have\u2014\n    full authority to manage the conduct of the trial.\u2019\n    Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 417\u2013418 (1988). As\n    to many decisions pertaining to the conduct of the\n    trial, the defendant is \u2018deemed bound by the acts of\n    his lawyer-agent and is considered to have \u201cnotice of\n    all facts, notice of which can be charged upon the at-\n    torney.\u201d \u2019 Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 634\n    (1962) (quoting Smith v. Ayer, 101 U. S. 320, 326\n    (1880)). Thus, decisions by counsel are generally\n    given effect as to what arguments to pursue, see Jones\n    v. Barnes, 463 U. S. 745, 751 (1983), what evidentiary\n    objections to raise, see Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U. S.\n    443, 451 (1965), and what agreements to conclude re-\n    garding the admission of evidence, see United States\n    v. McGill, 11 F. 3d 223, 226\u2013227 (CA1 1993). Absent\n    a demonstration of ineffectiveness, counsel\u2019s word on\n    such matters is the last.\u201d Ibid.\nThe issue in Hill was whether the attorney, acting without\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nindication of particular consent from his client, could\nwaive his client\u2019s statutory right to a speedy trial pursu-\nant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. The Court\nheld that the attorney\u2019s statement, without any showing of\nthe client\u2019s explicit consent, could waive the speedy trial\nright: \u201cScheduling matters are plainly among those for\nwhich agreement by counsel generally controls.\u201d Id., at\n115.\n   Giving the attorney control of trial management matters\nis a practical necessity. \u201cThe adversary process could not\nfunction effectively if every tactical decision required\nclient approval.\u201d Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 418\n(1988). The presentation of a criminal defense can be a\nmystifying process even for well-informed laypersons.\nThis is one of the reasons for the right to counsel. See\nPowell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 68\u201369 (1932); ABA Stan-\ndards for Criminal Justice, Defense Function 4\u20135.2, Com-\nmentary, p. 202 (3d ed. 1993) (\u201cMany of the rights of an\naccused, including constitutional rights, are such that only\ntrained experts can comprehend their full significance,\nand an explanation to any but the most sophisticated\nclient would be futile\u201d). Numerous choices affecting con-\nduct of the trial, including the objections to make, the\nwitnesses to call, and the arguments to advance, depend\nnot only upon what is permissible under the rules of evi-\ndence and procedure but also upon tactical considerations\nof the moment and the larger strategic plan for the trial.\nThese matters can be difficult to explain to a layperson;\nand to require in all instances that they be approved by\nthe client could risk compromising the efficiencies and\nfairness that the trial process is designed to promote. In\nexercising professional judgment, moreover, the attorney\ndraws upon the expertise and experience that members of\nthe bar should bring to the trial process. In most in-\nstances the attorney will have a better understanding of\nthe procedural choices than the client; or at least the law\n8               GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nshould so assume. See Jones v. Barnes, 463 U. S. 745, 751\n(1983); see also Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U. S. 258, 267\u2013\n268 (1973); cf. ABA Standards, supra, at 202 (\u201cEvery\nexperienced advocate can recall the disconcerting experi-\nence of trying to conduct the examination of a witness or\nfollow opposing arguments or the judge\u2019s charge while the\nclient \u2018plucks at the attorney\u2019s sleeve\u2019 offering gratuitous\nsuggestions\u201d). To hold that every instance of waiver re-\nquires the personal consent of the client himself or herself\nwould be impractical.\n   Similar to the scheduling matter in Hill, acceptance of a\nmagistrate judge at the jury selection phase is a tactical\ndecision that is well suited for the attorney\u2019s own decision.\nUnder Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\nthe presiding judge has significant discretion over the\nstructure of voir dire. The judge may ask questions of the\njury pool or, as in this case, allow the attorneys for the\nparties to do so. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 24(a); App. 20. A\nmagistrate judge\u2019s or a district judge\u2019s particular approach\nto voir dire both in substance\u2014the questions asked\u2014and\nin tone\u2014formal or informal\u2014may be relevant in light of\nthe attorney\u2019s own approach. The attorney may decide\nwhether to accept the magistrate judge based in part on\nthese factors. As with other tactical decisions, requiring\npersonal, on-the-record approval from the client could\nnecessitate a lengthy explanation the client might not\nunderstand at the moment and that might distract from\nmore pressing matters as the attorney seeks to prepare\nthe best defense. For these reasons we conclude that\nexpress consent by counsel suffices to permit a magistrate\njudge to preside over jury selection in a felony trial, pur-\nsuant to the authorization in \u00a7636(b)(3).\n   Our holding is not inconsistent with reading other\nprecedents to hold that some basic trial choices are so\nimportant that an attorney must seek the client\u2019s consent\nin order to waive the right. See, e.g., Florida v. Nixon, 543\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 175, 187 (2004) (identifying the choices \u201c \u2018to plead\nguilty, waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or\ntake an appeal\u2019 \u201d as examples (quoting Jones, supra, at\n751)). Petitioner argues that the decision to have a magis-\ntrate judge rather than an Article III judge preside at jury\nselection is a fundamental choice, cf. Hill, 528 U. S., at\n114, or, at least, raises a question of constitutional signifi-\ncance so that we should interpret the Act to require an\nexplicit personal statement of consent before the magis-\ntrate judge can proceed with jury selection.\n   We conclude otherwise. Under the avoidance canon,\n\u201cwhen \u2018a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one\nof which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise\nand by the other of which such questions are avoided, our\nduty is to adopt the latter.\u2019 \u201d Harris v. United States, 536\nU. S. 545, 555 (2002) (quoting United States ex rel. Attor-\nney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408\n(1909)). The canon, however, does not apply unless there\nare \u201cserious concerns about the statute\u2019s constitutional-\nity.\u201d Harris, supra, at 555; see also Reno v. Flores, 507\nU. S. 292, 314, n. 9 (1993).\n   Those concerns are not present here. Petitioner con-\ncedes that a magistrate judge is capable of competent and\nimpartial performance of the judicial tasks involved in\njury examination and selection. Reply Brief for Petitioner\n12\u201313; see also Peretz, 501 U. S., at 935 (\u201cThe Act evinces\na congressional belief that magistrates are well qualified\nto handle matters of similar importance to jury selection\u201d).\nThe Act contains some features to ensure impartiality.\nSee, e.g., 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7631(i) (establishing requirements\nfor removal), 632 (limiting concurrent employment), 634(b)\n(providing salary protection during the term). And \u201c \u2018the\ndistrict judge\u2014insulated by life tenure and irreducible\nsalary\u2014is waiting in the wings, fully able to correct er-\nrors.\u2019 \u201d Peretz, supra, at 938 (quoting United States v.\nRaddatz, 447 U. S. 667, 686 (1980) (Blackmun, J., concur-\n10             GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nring)). Here petitioner made no objections to the rulings\nby the Magistrate Judge. Had objections been made,\nnothing in the record or the rules indicates that the Dis-\ntrict Judge could not have ruled on the issues, all with no\ndelay or prejudice to any trial that had commenced. See\nPeretz, supra, at 935, n. 12, 939. These factors support our\ndetermination that consent of counsel suffices to allow a\nmagistrate judge to supervise voir dire. This is not a case\nwhere the magistrate judge is asked to preside or make\ndeterminations after the trial has commenced and it is\narguably difficult or disruptive for a district judge to re-\nview any objections that might have been made to the\nmagistrate judge\u2019s rulings.\n   Petitioner notes that Peretz considered supervision over\nentire civil and misdemeanor trials comparable to presid-\ning over voir dire at a felony trial. 501 U. S., at 933. It\nfollows, he argues, that \u00a7636(b)(3) must require, as does\n18 U. S. C. \u00a73401(b), express personal consent by the de-\nfendant before a magistrate judge may preside over voir\ndire. But it is not obvious that Congress would have\nthought these matters required the same form of consent.\nAside from the fact that the statutory text is different,\nthere are relevant differences between presiding over a\nfull trial and presiding over voir dire. Were petitioner\ncorrect, one would think the Act would require at least\nthe same form of consent to authorize a magistrate judge\nto preside over either a civil or a misdemeanor trial\n(which Peretz also deemed to be of comparable impor-\ntance). Our interpretation of the Act indicates otherwise.\nCompare \u00a73401(b), with Roell v. Withrow, 538 U. S. 580,\n590 (2003) (concluding that parties may authorize a\nfull-time magistrate judge to preside over a civil trial via\nimplied consent).\n   Petitioner argues that our view of the issue should be\ninformed by Gomez\u2019s conclusion that having a magistrate\njudge during jury selection without consent is structural\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nerror, not subject to harmless-error review. See 490 U. S.,\nat 876. The exemption of certain errors from harmless-\nerror review \u201crecognizes that some errors necessarily\nrender a trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d Rose v. Clark, 478\nU. S. 570, 577 (1986); see also id., at 577\u2013578. In peti-\ntioner\u2019s view, Gomez establishes that the issue in this case\nis of sufficient gravity or concern that personal consent\nmust be required.\n   The Court held in Gomez that imposition of a magistrate\njudge over objection was structural error, violating the\nbasic right to a trial conducted at all critical stages by a\njudicial officer with appropriate jurisdiction. 490 U. S., at\n876. It does not follow, however, that this structural\naspect requires an insistence on personal consent. Here,\njurisdiction turns on consent; and for the reasons dis-\ncussed above an attorney, acting on the client\u2019s behalf, can\nmake an informed decision to allow the magistrate judge\nto exercise the jurisdiction Congress permits.\n   Although a criminal defendant may demand that an\nArticle III judge preside over the selection of a jury, the\nchoice to do so reflects considerations more significant to\nthe realm of the attorney than to the accused. Requiring\nthe defendant to consent to a magistrate judge only by\nway of an on-the-record personal statement is not dictated\nby precedent and would burden the trial process, with\nlittle added protection for the defendant.\n   Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7636(b)(3) a magistrate judge\nmay preside over jury examination and jury selection only\nif the parties, or the attorneys for the parties, consent.\nConsent from an attorney will suffice. We do not have\nbefore us, and we do not address, an instance where the\nattorney states consent but the party by express and\ntimely objection seeks to override his or her counsel. We\nneed not decide, moreover, if consent may be inferred from\na failure by a party and his or her attorney to object to the\npresiding by a magistrate judge. These issues are not\n12             GONZALEZ v.

As to\nwhether the Constitution requires that, the Court holds\nthat it does not because it is a decision more tactical than\nfundamental\u2014\u201cmore significant to the realm of the attor-\nney than to the accused.\u201d Ante, at 11. I agree with the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion, but not with the tactical-vs.-\nfundamental test on which it is based.\n   Petitioner and the Government do not dispute that\npetitioner\u2019s counsel consented to have a magistrate judge\noversee voir dire. The issue is whether that consent\u2014\nconsent of counsel alone\u2014effected a valid waiver of peti-\ntioner\u2019s right to an Article III judge. It is important to\nbear in mind that we are not speaking here of action taken\nby counsel over his client\u2019s objection\u2014which would have\nthe effect of revoking the agency with respect to the action\nin question. See Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U. S. 1, 7\u20138\n(1966). There is no suggestion of that. The issue is\nwhether consent expressed by counsel alone is ineffective\nsimply because the defendant himself did not express to\nthe court his consent.\n   I think not. Our opinions have sometimes said in pass-\ning that, under the Constitution, certain \u201cfundamental\u201d or\n2                  GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u201cbasic\u201d rights cannot be waived unless a defendant per-\nsonally participates in the waiver. See, e.g., Taylor v.\nIllinois, 484 U. S. 400, 417\u2013418 (1988); United States v.\nOlano, 507 U. S. 725, 733 (1993). We have even repeated\nthe suggestion in cases that actually involved the question\nwhether a criminal defendant\u2019s attorney could waive a\ncertain right\u2014but never in a case where the suggestion\ngoverned the disposition. In New York v. Hill, 528 U. S.\n110 (2000), although we noted that \u201c[f]or certain funda-\nmental rights, the defendant must personally make an\ninformed waiver,\u201d id., at 114, we in fact found such a\nrequirement inapplicable; and even that determination\ncan be viewed as resting upon an interpretation of the\nstatute creating the right that counsel had waived, see id.,\nat 115. And in Florida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175 (2004),\nalthough we said that \u201ccounsel lacks authority to consent\nto a guilty plea on [his] client\u2019s behalf,\u201d id., at 187, our\nholding was simply that counsel\u2019s concession of guilt to the\njury did not amount to a guilty plea, id., at 188, and did\nnot constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, id., at 192.\nAs detailed in the margin, the decisions often cited for the\nprinciple of attorney incapacity are inapposite;1 except for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 On the right to jury, Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 (1898), held,\n\nat most, that the right was not waivable. Id., at 353\u2013354. The Court\nlater questioned whether Thompson even held that, and went on to\nhold that the right is waivable. See Patton v. United States, 281 U. S.\n276, 293 (1930). The observation at the end of Patton that \u201cbefore any\nwaiver can become effective, the consent of government counsel and the\nsanction of the court must be had, in addition to the express and\nintelligent consent of the defendant,\u201d id., at 312, was dictum; the Patton\ndefendants had all agreed to the waiver, id., at 286. Even less germane\nis Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269 (1942), which\nheld only that an unrepresented defendant can waive his right to jury\nwithout the advice of counsel. Id., at 278\u2013279.\n   On the right to trial, Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U. S. 1 (1966), held only\nthat a defendant\u2019s expressed wish to proceed to trial must prevail over\nhis attorney\u2019s contrary opinion. See id., at 7\u20138. Other decisions have\nsaid that waiver of the right to trial must be knowing and voluntary,\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                     3\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\none line of precedent, no decision of this Court holds that,\nas a constitutional matter, a defendant must personally\nwaive certain of his \u201cfundamental\u201d rights\u2014which typically\nare identified as the rights to trial, jury, and counsel. The\nexceptional line of precedent involves the right to counsel.\nSee Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464\u2013465 (1938). But\nthat right is essentially sui generis, since an unrepre-\nsented defendant cannot possibly waive his right to coun-\nsel except in person. Cases involving that right therefore\nprovide no support for the principle that the Constitution\nsometimes forbids attorney waiver.\n  Since a formula repeated in dictum but never the basis\nfor judgment is not owed stare decisis weight, see Lingle v.\nChevron U. S. A. Inc., 544 U. S. 528, 545\u2013546 (2005), our\nprecedents have not established the rule of decision appli-\ncable in this case. I would not adopt the tactical-vs.-\nfundamental approach, which is vague and derives from\nnothing more substantial than this Court\u2019s say-so. One\nrespected authority has noted that the approach has a\n\u201cpotential for uncertainty,\u201d and that our precedents pur-\nporting to apply it \u201chave been brief and conclusionary.\u201d 3\nW. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Proce-\ndure \u00a7\u00a711.6(a), (c), pp. 784, 796 (3d ed. 2007). That is\nsurely an understatement. What makes a right tactical?\nDepending on the circumstances, waiving any right can be\na tactical decision. Even pleading guilty, which waives the\nright to trial, is highly tactical, since it usually requires\nbalancing the prosecutor\u2019s plea bargain against the pros-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsee, e.g., Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970), but waiver\nby counsel was not at issue in those cases. Even if, in the case of\nwaiver by counsel, the knowing and voluntary requirement applies to\nthe defendant himself, that still permits counsel to waive on behalf of\nan informed and agreeing client. Equally inapposite is Boykin v.\nAlabama, 395 U. S. 238 (1969), which held that a knowing and volun-\ntary waiver of the right to trial cannot be inferred from a silent record.\nId., at 244.\n4                  GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\npect of better and worse outcomes at trial.\n   Whether a right is \u201cfundamental\u201d is equally mysterious.\nOne would think that any right guaranteed by the Consti-\ntution would be fundamental. But I doubt many think\nthat the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses\ncannot be waived by counsel. See Diaz v. United States,\n223 U. S. 442, 444, 452\u2013453 (1912). Perhaps, then, speci-\nfication in the Constitution is a necessary, but not suffi-\ncient, condition for \u201cfundamental\u201d status. But if some-\nthing more is necessary, I cannot imagine what it might\nbe. Apart from constitutional guarantee, I know of no\nobjective criterion for ranking rights. The Court concludes\nthat the right to have an Article III judge oversee voir dire\nis not a fundamental right, ante, at 8\u201310, without answer-\ning whether it is even a constitutional right,2 and without\nexplaining what makes a right fundamental in the first\nplace. The essence of \u201cfundamental\u201d rights continues to\nelude.\n   I would therefore adopt the rule that, as a constitutional\nmatter, all waivable rights (except, of course, the right to\ncounsel) can be waived by counsel. There is no basis in\nthe Constitution, or as far as I am aware in common-law\npractice, for distinguishing in this regard between a\ncriminal defendant and his authorized representative. In\nfact, the very notion of representative litigation suggests\nthat the Constitution draws no distinction between them.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Wehave avoided addressing whether the right has a basis in the\nConstitution. In Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858 (1989), we\ninterpreted the Federal Magistrate Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7636(b)(3), not to\npermit a magistrate judge to oversee voir dire, 490 U. S., at 875\u2013876,\nmaking it unnecessary to consider whether there was a constitutional\nright to have an Article III judge oversee voir dire. In Peretz v. United\nStates, 501 U. S. 923 (1991), we held that judicial overseeing of the voir\ndire had been waived, id., at 936\u2013937, which obviated having to decide\nwhether it was a constitutional right. See United States v. Olano, 507\nU. S. 725, 732\u2013733 (1993) (waiver extinguishes the error of not comply-\ning with a legal rule).\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u201cA prisoner . . . who defends by counsel, and silently ac-\nquiesces in what they agree to, is bound as any other\nprincipal by the act of his agent.\u201d People v. Rathbun, 21\nWend. 509, 543 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1839). The Rathbun opin-\nion, far from being the outlier view of a state court, was\nadopted as the common law position by eminent jurists of\nthe 19th century, including Chief Justice Shaw of the\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. See Common-\nwealth v. Dailey, 66 Mass. 80, 83 (1853) (discussing\nRathbun with approval in a case involving waiver of the\nright to a 12-man jury).\n  It may well be desirable to require a defendant\u2019s per-\nsonal waiver with regard to certain rights. Rule 11(c) of\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, for example,\nprovides that before accepting a guilty plea the court must\n\u201caddress the defendant personally in open court,\u201d advise\nhim of the consequences of his plea, and assure that the\nplea is voluntary. See also Rule 10(b) (waiver of right to\nappear at arraignment must be in writing signed by coun-\nsel and defendant). I do not contend that the Sixth\nAmendment\u2019s right to assistance of counsel prohibits such\nrequirements of personal participation, at least where\nthey do not impair counsel\u2019s expert assistance.\n  Even without such rules it is certainly prudent, to fore-\nstall later challenges to counsel\u2019s conduct, for a trial court\nto satisfy itself of the defendant\u2019s personal consent to\ncertain actions, such as entry of a guilty plea or waiver of\njury trial, for which objective norms require an attorney to\nseek his client\u2019s authorization. See, e.g., ABA Model Rule\nof Professional Conduct 1.2(a) (2007) (\u201cIn a criminal case,\nthe lawyer shall abide by the client\u2019s decision, after con-\nsultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered,\nwhether to waive jury trial and whether the client will\ntestify\u201d). But I know of no basis for saying that the Consti-\ntution automatically invalidates any trial action not taken\nby the defendant personally, though taken by his author-\n6              GONZALEZ v.

I know of no way of determining, except by\nsheer prescription, which trial rights are ex ante and by\nlaw subject to such a limitation upon waiver. Assuredly\nthe tactical-fundamental dichotomy does not do the trick.\nI would leave this matter of placing reasonable limits upon\nthe right of agency in criminal trials to be governed by\npositive law, in statutes and rules of procedure.\n  I would hold that petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s waiver was\neffective because no rule or statute provides that the\nwaiver come from the defendant personally.\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

UNITED \n\n                 STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [May 12, 2008] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.\n   The Court holds today that neither the Federal Magis-\ntrates Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7631 et seq., nor the Constitution\nrequires that a criminal defendant on trial for a felony\npersonally give his informed consent before a magistrate\njudge may preside over jury selection. The Court proceeds\nfrom the premise, established in Peretz v. United States,\n501 U. S. 923 (1991), that the Federal Magistrates Act\nauthorizes magistrate judges to preside over felony jury\nselection if the parties consent. I reject that premise, and\nfor the reasons set forth below, would overrule Peretz and\nhold that the delegation of voir dire in this case was statu-\ntory error. I further conclude that the error may be cor-\nrected despite petitioner\u2019s failure to raise a timely objec-\ntion in the District Court. Accordingly, I would reverse\nthe judgment below.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   This is the third time the Court has addressed the cir-\ncumstances under which a district judge may delegate\nfelony voir dire proceedings to a magistrate judge under\nthe \u201cadditional duties\u201d clause of the Federal Magistrates\nAct, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7636(b)(3). In Gomez v. United States, 490\nU. S. 858 (1989), the Court unanimously held that\n2               GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a7636(b)(3) does not authorize delegation of felony voir dire\nproceedings to a magistrate judge. Although the defen-\ndants in Gomez had objected to the delegation, neither the\nCourt\u2019s reasoning nor its conclusion turned on that fact.\nRather, the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7636(b)(3) rested\nprimarily on two inferences drawn from the statutory\nscheme. First, the Court reasoned that Congress\u2019 \u201ccare-\nfully defined grant of authority to conduct trials of civil\nmatters and of minor criminal cases should be construed\nas an implicit withholding of the authority to preside at a\nfelony trial.\u201d Id., at 872. Second, the Court found it \u201cin-\ncongruous\u201d to assume that Congress intended felony jury\nselection to be among magistrate judges\u2019 additional duties\nbut failed to provide an explicit standard of review as it\nhad done for other duties described in the statute. Id., at\n874. Neither of these inferences depended on the presence\nor absence of the parties\u2019 consent, and the Court\u2019s conclu-\nsion was accordingly unqualified: \u201cCongress . . . did not\ncontemplate inclusion of jury selection in felony trials\namong a magistrate\u2019s additional duties.\u201d Id., at 872; see\nalso ibid., n. 25 (\u201c[W]e decide that the Federal Magistrates\nAct does not allow the delegation of jury selection to mag-\nistrates\u201d); id., at 875\u2013876 (\u201cThe absence of a specific refer-\nence to jury selection in the statute, or indeed, in the\nlegislative history, persuades us that Congress did not\nintend the additional duties clause to embrace this func-\ntion\u201d (footnote omitted)).\n   Two years later, the Court decided Peretz. Peretz\u2019s trial\ntook place before this Court\u2019s decision in Gomez, and his\nattorney had agreed to the delegation of voir dire, assuring\nthe Magistrate Judge that his client had consented. Dur-\ning the pendency of Peretz\u2019s appeal the Court decided\nGomez, and Peretz argued that Gomez required reversal of\nhis conviction. The Court of Appeals disagreed, conclud-\ning that he had waived any challenge to the Magistrate\nJudge\u2019s supervision of voir dire. Before this Court, the\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

United\nStates, O. T. 1990, No. 90\u2013615, p. 9.\n   Despite the Government\u2019s confession of error, the Court,\n\u201c[i]n an amazing display of interpretive gymnastics,\u201d\nPeretz, supra, at 940\u2013941 (Marshall, J., dissenting), held\nin a 5-to-4 decision that \u00a7636(b)(3) does, after all, permit\nmagistrate judges to conduct felony voir dire proceedings,\nso long as the parties consent. There is no need here to\nreproduce Peretz\u2019s flawed reasoning or to rehash the de-\nbate between the majority and dissenting opinions. Suf-\nfice it to say that, in my view, Gomez correctly interpreted\n\u00a7636(b)(3) not to authorize delegation of felony jury selec-\ntion regardless of the parties\u2019 consent, and I agree with\nthe dissenters in Peretz that the Court\u2019s contrary conclu-\nsion in that case was based on a patently \u201crevisionist\nconstruction of the Act.\u201d 501 U. S., at 947 (opinion of\nMarshall, J.).\n   The only question, then, is whether to give stare decisis\neffect to Peretz\u2019s erroneous conclusion that \u00a7636(b)(3)\nauthorizes magistrate judges to conduct felony jury selec-\ntion if the parties consent. Although \u201c[i]t is true that we\ngive stronger stare decisis effect to our holdings in statu-\ntory cases than in constitutional cases,\u201d that rule \u201cis not\nabsolute, and we should not hesitate to allow our prece-\ndent to yield to the true meaning of an Act of Congress\nwhen our statutory precedent is \u2018unworkable\u2019 or \u2018badly\nreasoned.\u2019 \u201d Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 401\u2013402\n(2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Peretz is both. Two con-\nsiderations in particular convince me that Peretz should be\noverruled.\n4               GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                              B\n   First, Peretz leaves the Court with no principled way to\ndecide the statutory question presented in this case.\nContrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, the question presented\nhere is not whether \u201cevery instance of waiver requires the\npersonal consent of the client,\u201d ante, at 8; rather, it is the\nfar narrower question whether \u00a7636(b)(3) requires the\ndefendant\u2019s personal consent before felony jury selection\nmay be delegated to a magistrate judge. The Court an-\nswers this question in the negative, but does not point to\nanything in \u00a7636(b)(3) or in the broader statutory scheme\nthat supports its conclusion. It does not because it cannot.\nNot having provided for delegation of felony voir dire\nproceedings under the additional duties clause, Congress\nof course did not specify whether the parties\u2019 consent is\nrequired. And \u201c[b]ecause the additional duties clause\ncontains no language predicating delegation of an addi-\ntional duty upon litigant consent, it likewise contains\nnothing indicating what constitutes \u2018consent\u2019 to the dele-\ngation of an additional duty.\u201d Peretz, supra, at 947, n. 6\n(Marshall, J., dissenting).\n   Congress\u2019 silence is particularly telling in the context of\nthe Federal Magistrates Act. Elsewhere in the Act, Con-\ngress took great care to specify whether and in what man-\nner the litigants must consent before a magistrate judge\nmay assume significant duties. In \u00a7636(c)(1), for example,\nCongress provided that full-time magistrate judges may\nconduct civil trials \u201c[u]pon the consent of the parties,\u201d and\nthat part-time magistrate judges may do so \u201c[u]pon the\nconsent of the parties, pursuant to their specific written\nrequest.\u201d Congress further provided in \u00a7636(c)(2) that\n\u201c[t]he decision of the parties shall be communicated to the\nclerk of court,\u201d and, if the parties do not consent, the\ndistrict judge may not raise the matter again without\n\u201cadvis[ing] the parties that they are free to withhold con-\nsent without adverse substantive consequences.\u201d I have\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npreviously explained at length why \u00a7636(c) is best read to\nrequire the express consent of the parties, see Roell v.\nWithrow, 538 U. S. 580, 591\u2013597 (2003) (dissenting opin-\nion), and I will not repeat that discussion here, other than\nto point out that Congress obviously focused on the issue\nand gave detailed instructions regarding the form of the\nparties\u2019 consent.\n  Even more telling is that Congress required the defen-\ndant\u2019s express, informed consent before a magistrate judge\nmay conduct a misdemeanor trial. Section 636(a)(3) au-\nthorizes magistrate judges to conduct certain misde-\nmeanor trials \u201cin conformity with and subject to the limi-\ntations of\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73401, which spells out in detail the\nmanner in which the defendant must consent:\n    \u201cThe magistrate judge shall carefully explain to the\n    defendant that he has a right to trial, judgment, and\n    sentencing by a district judge and that he may have a\n    right to trial by jury before a district judge or magis-\n    trate judge. The magistrate judge may not proceed to\n    try the case unless the defendant, after such explana-\n    tion, expressly consents to be tried before the magis-\n    trate judge and expressly and specifically waives trial,\n    judgment, and sentencing by a district judge. Any\n    such consent and waiver shall be made in writing or\n    orally on the record.\u201d \u00a73401(b).\n  The Court recites the language of \u00a73401(b), but gives it\nno weight in its analysis. It recognizes that \u201c[t]here are\ninstances in federal criminal proceedings where the proce-\ndural requisites for consent are specified and a right can-\nnot be waived except with a defendant\u2019s own informed\nconsent.\u201d Ante, at 4. But it is given no pause by the fact\nthat the Federal Magistrates Act, the very statute it in-\nterprets to permit delegation of felony proceedings without\nthe defendant\u2019s \u201cown informed consent,\u201d expressly re-\nquires such consent before a magistrate judge may con-\n6               GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nduct a misdemeanor trial. Instead, the Court worries that\n\u201crequiring personal, on-the-record approval from the client\ncould necessitate a lengthy explanation the client might\nnot understand at the moment and that might distract\nfrom more pressing matters,\u201d ante, at 8, heedless of the\nfact that Congress plainly viewed any such \u201cburden[s] [on]\nthe trial process,\u201d ante, at 11, as outweighed by the need to\nobtain the defendant\u2019s personal consent before a magis-\ntrate judge may preside, even over a misdemeanor trial.\n   The Court glides over this glaring anomaly, asserting\nthat \u201c[t]he controlling statute in this case has a different\ndesign,\u201d and \u201cdoes not state that consent to preside over\nfelony voir dire must be granted by following a procedure\nof similar clarity.\u201d Ante, at 5. But there is only one stat-\nute at issue here\u2014the Federal Magistrates Act expressly\nincorporates 18 U. S. C. \u00a73401(b)\u2014and the fact that it\ndoes not mandate \u201ca procedure of similar clarity\u201d for dele-\ngation of felony jury selection is hardly surprising, since\n\u00a7636(b)(3)\u2014which provides in its entirety that \u201c[a] magis-\ntrate judge may be assigned such additional duties as are\nnot inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the\nUnited States\u201d\u2014says not a word about delegation of felony\njury selection, much less about whether and in what form\nthe parties must consent.\n   The Court further suggests that \u00a73401(b) is inconse-\nquential because \u201cthere are relevant differences between\npresiding over a full trial and presiding over voir dire.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. But even Peretz recognized that \u201csupervision\nof entire civil and misdemeanor trials\u201d is \u201ccomparable in\nresponsibility and importance to presiding over voir dire\nat a felony trial.\u201d 501 U. S., at 933. And of course, it was\nCongress\u2019 omission of any mode of consent for delegation\nof felony proceedings, in contradistinction to its detailed\ntreatment of the consent required for delegation of civil\nand misdemeanor trials, that drove Gomez\u2019s analysis. 490\nU. S., at 872 (\u201c[T]he carefully defined grant of authority to\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

The Court\nonce thought that Congress\u2019 differential treatment of\nfelony jury selection and misdemeanor trials was a reason\nto believe that Congress had entirely withheld authority to\npreside over felony jury selection. Today, however, the\nCourt says that the \u201crelevant differences\u201d between these\nresponsibilities support the conclusion that Congress\npermitted delegation of felony jury selection upon a lesser\nshowing of consent than that required for delegation of a\nmisdemeanor trial.\n   In the end, I am sympathetic to petitioner\u2019s argument\nthat \u00a7636(b)(3) should be read in pari materia with\n\u00a73401(b). See Brief for Petitioner 38 (\u201cIf, in enacting the\n[Federal Magistrates Act] Congress believed a defendant\u2019s\nexplicit, personal consent was constitutionally necessary\nto bestow authority upon a magistrate judge in federal\nmisdemeanor cases, then a fortiori Congress would have\nbelieved that such explicit, personal consent is necessary\nto permit a magistrate judge to conduct felony jury selec-\ntion\u201d). And I share his view that Congress undoubtedly\nwould have adopted something akin to \u00a73401(b)\u2019s re-\nquirements had it authorized delegation of felony jury\nselection. See Peretz, supra, at 947, n. 6 (Marshall, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201cI would think, however, that the standard\ngoverning a party\u2019s consent to delegation of a portion of a\nfelony trial under the additional duties clause should be at\nleast as strict as that governing delegation of a misde-\n8               GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmeanor trial to a magistrate\u201d).\n  Nonetheless, I do not believe that Peretz\u2019s erroneous\ninterpretation of \u00a7636(b)(3) gives me license to rewrite the\nFederal Magistrates Act to reflect what I think Congress\nwould have done had it contemplated delegation of felony\njury selection or foreseen the Court\u2019s decision in Peretz.\nCf. Brief for Petitioner 33 (\u201cWhat the Court is left to do in\npetitioner\u2019s case is to fill the gap by determining what\nCongress would have done in enacting the [Federal Magis-\ntrates Act] had it expressly addressed the \u2018crucial\u2019 consent\nissue\u201d (footnote omitted)). Where, as here, a mistaken\ninterpretation of a statute leaves the Court with no prin-\ncipled way to answer subsequent questions that arise\nunder the statute, it seems to me that the better course is\nsimply to acknowledge and correct the error.              Cf.\nKimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip\nop., at 3) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n                               C\n   A second reason why I would not give stare decisis effect\nto Peretz is that it requires us to wade into a constitutional\nmorass. In Gomez, the Court declined to decide whether\nthe Constitution permits delegation of felony jury selection\nto a magistrate judge. 490 U. S., at 872, n. 25. Peretz\nsimply brushed aside that difficult constitutional question.\nSee 501 U. S., at 936 (\u201cThere is no constitutional infirmity\nin the delegation of felony trial jury selection to a magis-\ntrate when the litigants consent\u201d); cf. id., at 948\u2013952\n(Marshall, J., dissenting) (discussing the \u201cserious constitu-\ntional question\u201d \u201cwhether jury selection by a magistrate\u2014\neven when a defendant consents\u2014is consistent with Arti-\ncle III\u201d); id., at 956 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (not resolving\n\u201cthe serious and difficult constitutional questions raised\nby the [majority\u2019s] construction,\u201d but suggesting that the\nCourt\u2019s reasoning rendered \u201cthe doctrine of unconstitu-\ntional delegation\u201d \u201ca dead letter\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   Today the Court\u2019s result requires it to go even further.\nIn addition to reaffirming Peretz\u2019s questionable holding\nthat the Constitution permits delegation of felony voir dire\nproceedings to a non-Article III judge, the Court decides\nthat a criminal defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to an Arti-\ncle III judge need not be personal and informed. The\nCourt treats this as an easy question, concluding that the\nchoice between an Article III judge and a magistrate judge\nis not among those \u201cbasic trial choices,\u201d ante, at 8, that\nrequire a defendant\u2019s personal consent because \u201ca magis-\ntrate judge is capable of competent and impartial per-\nformance of the judicial tasks involved in jury examination\nand selection,\u201d and because magistrate judges are super-\nvised by Article III judges, ante, at 9, 10. Under our prece-\ndents, however, the question is not so easily dispatched.\n   Our cases shed little light on whether and when a\ncriminal defendant must personally waive a constitutional\nright. Although we have previously stated that, \u201c[f]or\ncertain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally\nmake an informed waiver,\u201d New York v. Hill, 528 U. S.\n110, 114 (2000), many of the cases we have cited for that\nproposition do not in fact stand for it. For example, we\nhave cited Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U. S. 1 (1966), for the\nproposition that the defendant\u2019s personal consent is re-\nquired for a waiver of his right to plead not guilty. See,\ne.g., Hill, supra, at 114. But Brookhart\u2019s holding was\nnarrower.     The only question presented there was\n\u201cwhether counsel has power to enter a plea which is incon-\nsistent with his client\u2019s expressed desire and thereby waive\nhis client\u2019s constitutional right to plead not guilty and\nhave a trial in which he can confront and cross-examine\nthe witnesses against him.\u201d 384 U. S., at 7 (emphasis\nadded). Brookhart thus did not decide whether the Con-\nstitution prohibits counsel from entering a guilty plea on\nhis client\u2019s behalf in cases where the defendant has not\nexpressed a contrary desire.\n10             GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   Similarly, Patton v. United States, 281 U. S. 276 (1930),\na case often cited for the proposition that the right to a\njury trial can be waived only by the defendant personally,\ndoes not draw a clear distinction between the defendant\u2019s\nown consent and that of his attorney. The Court stated in\ndicta that \u201cthe express and intelligent consent of the de-\nfendant\u201d is required \u201cbefore any waiver [of the right to a\njury trial] can become effective.\u201d Id., at 312. But that\nrequirement appears to have been satisfied in Patton by\ncounsel\u2019s representation to the trial court that he had\nconferred with his clients and obtained their consent. Id.,\nat 286\u2013287.\n   Our cases thus provide little relevant guidance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA may well be correct that, as a matter of\nfirst principles, there is no right (other than perhaps the\nsui generis right to counsel) that cannot be waived by a\ndefendant\u2019s attorney, acting as the duly authorized agent\nof his client. See ante, at 4 (opinion concurring in judg-\nment). But if I were to accept the Court\u2019s oft-repeated\ndictum that there are certain fundamental rights that can\nbe waived only by the defendant personally, see, e.g.,\nFlorida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175, 187 (2004) (\u201c[C]ertain\ndecisions regarding the exercise or waiver of basic trial\nrights are of such moment that they cannot be made for\nthe defendant by a surrogate\u201d); Hill, supra, at 114; Taylor\nv. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 417\u2013418 (1988) (\u201c[T]here are\nbasic rights that the attorney cannot waive without the\nfully informed and publicly acknowledged consent of the\nclient\u201d), I see no reason why the right to an Article III\njudge should not be among them.\n   There is no apparent reason, for example, why the right\nto an Article III judge should be deemed any less funda-\nmental, or its exercise any more \u201c \u2018tactical,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 7\n(opinion of the Court) (quoting Taylor, supra, at 418), than\nthe right to a jury trial.

The Court\u2019s\nobservation that \u201ca magistrate judge is capable of compe-\ntent and impartial performance\u201d of judicial duties, ante, at\n9, is thus beside the point.* Magistrate judges do not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    * Equally beside the point is the fact that magistrate judges are\nappointed by, and subject to the supervision of, district judges. The\nCourt reassures itself by hypothesizing that the District Court could\nhave ruled on any objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s rulings. Ante, at\n10. But the Court once \u201charbor[ed] serious doubts\u201d that a district judge\nwho was not present during jury selection could \u201cmeaningfully\u201d review\na magistrate judge\u2019s rulings, Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858, 874\n(1989), because \u201cno transcript can recapture the atmosphere of the voir\ndire,\u201d id., at 875. The Court does not explain what has intervened to\ndispel those doubts. And even if district judges could meaningfully\nreview magistrate judges\u2019 voir dire rulings, that would not change the\nfact that magistrate judges are subject to outside influences in ways\nthat Article III judges are not. As Judge Posner has explained:\n    \u201cThe fact that the appointing power has been given to Article III\njudges is the opposite of reassuring. It makes magistrates beholden to\njudges as well as to Congress. . . . The Constitution built internal\nchecks and balances into the legislative branch by making Congress\nbicameral and into the judicial branch by guaranteeing all federal\njudges\u2014not just Supreme Court Justices, or appellate judges gener-\nally\u2014tenure during good behavior and protection against pay cuts.\nAppellate judges can reverse district judges, can mandamus them, can\ncriticize them, can remand a case to another judge, but cannot fire\ndistrict judges, cow them, or silence them\u2014cannot prevent them from\nmaking independent judgments and expressing independent views. . . .\n[A]s long as [district judges] enjoy the tenure and compensation protec-\ntions of Article III, they are independent of [those] who appointed them\n. . . . Magistrates do not have those protections; the judges control their\n12                GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nenjoy the structural protections of Article III: They serve\n8-year terms and may be removed for cause, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7631(e), (i), and they are subject to diminution of their\nsalaries and outright abolition of their offices by Congress.\nAccordingly, whatever their virtues, magistrate judges are\nno substitute for Article III judges in the eyes of the Con-\nstitution.\n   In short, if I accepted the Court\u2019s dictum that the right\nto a jury trial may be waived only by the defendant per-\nsonally, see, e.g., Nixon, supra, at 187, I would be hard\npressed to conclude that waiver of the right to an Article\nIII judge during a critical stage of a felony trial requires\nanything less. That said, I include this brief discussion of\nthe constitutional issues this case presents not because I\nwould decide them, but to point out that the Court gives\nthem short shrift. These are serious constitutional ques-\ntions, see Roell, 538 U. S., at 595 (THOMAS, J., dissenting),\nand they are posed only because of Peretz\u2019s erroneous\ninterpretation of the Federal Magistrates Act. Indeed, I\nsuspect that Congress withheld from magistrate judges\nthe authority to preside during felony trials precisely in\norder to avoid the constitutional questions Peretz now\nthrusts upon us. Again, rather than plow headlong into\nthis constitutional thicket, the better choice is simply to\noverrule Peretz. Cf. Peretz, 501 U. S., at 952 (Marshall, J.,\ndissenting) (finding the Court\u2019s resolution of difficult\nArticle III questions \u201cparticularly unfortunate\u201d where \u201cthe\nmost coherent reading of the Federal Magistrates Act\navoids these problems entirely\u201d).\n                            II\n  Because I conclude that Peretz should be overruled, and\nthat the District Court therefore erred in delegating voir\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nreappointment.\u201d Geras v.

It is true that peti-\ntioner did not raise a timely objection to the District\nCourt\u2019s delegation of voir dire. And petitioner cannot\nsatisfy the plain-error rule because the statutory error\nbelow\u2014unauthorized delegation of voir dire to a magis-\ntrate judge\u2014was not \u201cplain\u201d under Peretz.\n   Not all uncontested errors, however, are subject to the\nplain-error rule.     In limited circumstances, we have\n\u201cagreed to correct, at least on direct review, violations of a\nstatutory provision that embodies a strong policy concern-\ning the proper administration of judicial business even\nthough the defect was not raised in a timely manner.\u201d\nNguyen v. United States, 539 U. S. 69, 78 (2003) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). In Nguyen, a non-Article III\njudge sat by designation on the Ninth Circuit panel that\naffirmed petitioners\u2019 convictions. Petitioners failed to\nobject to the composition of the panel in the Ninth Circuit\nand raised the issue for the first time in their petitions for\ncertiorari. Because the Ninth Circuit panel \u201ccontravened\nthe statutory requirements set by Congress for the compo-\nsition of the federal courts of appeals,\u201d id., at 80, and\nbecause those requirements \u201cembodie[d] weighty congres-\nsional policy concerning the proper organization of the\nfederal courts,\u201d id., at 79, we held that petitioners\u2019 failure\nto object did not preclude relief. We specifically declined\nto apply the plain-error rule:\n    \u201cIt is true, as the Government observes, that a failure\n    to object to trial error ordinarily limits an appellate\n    court to review for plain error. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72111;\n    Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b). But to ignore the viola-\n14              GONZALEZ v.

Even if the parties had ex-\n     pressly stipulated to the participation of a non-Article\n     III judge in the consideration of their appeals, no mat-\n     ter how distinguished and well qualified the judge\n     might be, such a stipulation would not have cured the\n     plain defect in the composition of the panel.\u201d Id., at\n     80\u201381.\n   I see no reason to treat this case differently than\nNguyen. Just as \u201cCongress\u2019 decision to preserve the Arti-\ncle III character of the courts of appeals [was] more than a\ntrivial concern\u201d in that case, id., at 80, so too here Con-\ngress\u2019 decision to preserve the Article III character of\nfelony trials \u201cembodies weighty congressional policy con-\ncerning the proper organization of the federal courts,\u201d id.,\nat 79. Accordingly, as in Nguyen, the Court can and\nshould correct the error in this case despite petitioner\u2019s\nfailure to raise a timely objection below.\n                            III\n  For the reasons stated, I would reverse the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals and remand for a new trial.\n",

United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112645\"><a href=\"/opinion/112645/peretz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">923</span></a></span>, 933, 111 S.Ct. 2661, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1767</span> 115 L.Ed.2d 808 (1991). This case presents the question whether it suffices for counsel alone to consent to the magistrate judge's role in presiding over <i>voir dire</i> and jury selection or whether the defendant must give his or her own consent.</p>\n<p>Homero Gonzalez was charged in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on five felony drug offense counts. He is the petitioner here. At the outset of jury selection, the parties appeared before a Magistrate Judge. The Magistrate Judge asked the attorneys to approach the bench. After they complied, the Magistrate Judge said: \"I need to ask the parties at this time if they are going to consent to having the United States Magistrate Judge proceed in assisting in the jury selection of this case.\" App. 16. Petitioner's counsel responded: \"Yes, your Honor, we are.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Magistrate Judge asked if petitioner was present and if he needed an interpreter. Petitioner's counsel answered yes to both questions. Petitioner was not asked if he consented to the Magistrate Judge's presiding. The record does not permit us to infer this or even to infer that petitioner knew there was a right to be waived. The Magistrate Judge then supervised <i>voir dire</i> and jury selection. Petitioner made no objections to the Magistrate Judge's rulings or her conduct of the proceedings. A District Judge presided at the ensuing jury trial, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p>Petitioner appealed, contending, for the first time, that it was error not to obtain his own consent to the Magistrate Judge's presiding at <i>voir dire.</i> The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the convictions. The court concluded petitioner could not show the error was plain and, furthermore, there was no error at all. It held the right to have an Article III judge preside over <i>voir dire</i> could be waived by petitioner's counsel. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"48717\"><a href=\"/opinion/48717/usa-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 394 (2007). The Courts of Appeals differ on this issue. Compare <i>ibid.,</i> with <i>United States v. Maragh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73754\"><a href=\"/opinion/73754/usa-v-maragh/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></a></span>, 1206 (C.A.11 1999) (requiring personal and explicit consent from the defendant); see also <i>United States v. Desir,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199719\"><a href=\"/opinion/199719/united-states-v-desir/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 44 (C.A.1 2001) (magistrate judge may conduct jury selection unless the defendant or his attorney registers an objection). We granted certiorari. 551 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 32, 168 L.Ed.2d 809 (2007). We agree that there was no error and hold that petitioner's counsel had full authority to consent to the Magistrate Judge's role.</p>\n<p>The Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 631 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. V), permits district courts to assign designated functions to magistrate judges. For example, magistrate judges are authorized to: issue orders concerning release or detention of persons pending trial; take acknowledgments, affidavits, and depositions; and enter sentences for petty offenses. \u00a7 636(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). They also may hear and determine, when designated to do so, any pretrial matter pending before the district court, with the exception of certain specified motions. Magistrate judges may also conduct hearings and propose recommendations for those motions, applications for post-trial criminal relief, and conditions of confinement petitions. \u00a7 636(b)(1) (2000 ed.). If the parties consent, they may conduct misdemeanor criminal trials and civil trials. \u00a7\u00a7 636(a)(3) and (c)(1).</p>\n<p>The statutory provision of direct applicability in the present case is \u00a7 636(b)(3). It states: \"A magistrate judge may be assigned such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" The general, nonspecific terms of this paragraph, preceded by text that sets out permissible duties in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1768</span> more precise terms, constitute a residual or general category that must not be interpreted in terms so expansive that the paragraph overshadows all that goes before.</p>\n<p>In two earlier cases the Court considered the question of magistrate judges presiding over the jury selection process in felony trials. In <i>Gomez v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112280\"><a href=\"/opinion/112280/gomez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2237, 104 L.Ed.2d 923 (1989), the District Judge delegated the task of selecting a jury to a Federal Magistrate Judge. Defense counsel objected, but the objection was overruled. The Court noted that \"[a] critical limitation on [the magistrate judge's] expanded jurisdiction is consent,\" <i>id.,</i> at 870, 109 S.Ct. 2237, and held that presiding, over an objection, at the preliminary selection phase of a jury trial in felony cases is not among the additional duties that a magistrate judge may assume, <i>id.,</i> at 875-876, 109 S.Ct. 2237.</p>\n<p>In <i>Peretz v. United States, supra</i><i>,</i> the Court again considered whether a magistrate judge could preside over <i>voir dire</i> in a felony case. In that instance, however, defendant's counsel, upon being asked by the District Court at a pretrial conference (with the defendant present) if there was any objection to having jury selection before a magistrate judge, responded, \"`I would love the opportunity.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 925, 111 S.Ct. 2661. Defense counsel later advised the Magistrate Judge that the defendant consented to the process. The Court clarified that in a felony trial neither the Act nor Article III forbids supervision of <i>voir dire</i> by a magistrate judge if both parties consent. <i>Id.,</i> at 935-936, 111 S.Ct. 2661.</p>\n<p>Taken together, <i>Gomez</i> and <i>Peretz</i> mean that \"the additional duties\" the statute permits the magistrate judge to undertake include presiding at <i>voir dire</i> and jury selection provided there is consent but not if there is an objection. We now consider whether the consent can be given by counsel acting on behalf of the client but without the client's own express consent.</p>\n<p>At first reading it might seem that our holding here is dictated by the holding in <i>Peretz.</i> In <i>Peretz,</i> it would appear the accused was aware of the colloquy between the District Judge and defense counsel and the formal waiver before the Magistrate Judge. On this premise <i>Peretz</i> might be read narrowly to hold that a defendant may signal consent by failing to object; and indeed, the petitioner here seeks to distinguish <i>Peretz</i> on this ground. Brief for Petitioner 41-42. We decide this case, however, on the assumption that the defendant did not hear, or did not understand, the waiver discussions. This addresses what, at least in petitioner's view, <i>Peretz</i> did not. It should be noted that we do not have before us an instance where a defendant instructs the lawyer or advises the court in an explicit, timely way that he or she demands that a district judge preside in this preliminary phase.</p>\n<p>There are instances in federal criminal proceedings where the procedural requisites for consent are specified and a right cannot be waived except with a defendant's own informed consent. Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b), for example, the district court is required, as a precondition to acceptance of a guilty plea, to inform the defendant in person of the specified rights he or she may claim in a full criminal trial and then verify that the plea is voluntary by addressing the defendant. The requirement is satisfied by a colloquy between judge and defendant, reviewing all of the rights listed in Rule 11.</p>\n<p>Statutes may also address this subject. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(b), for example, a magistrate judge may preside over the whole trial and sentencing in a misdemeanor case but only with the express, personal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1769</span> consent of the defendant. The provision requires that the magistrate judge</p>\n<blockquote>\"carefully explain to the defendant that he has a right to trial, judgment, and sentencing by a district judge and that he may have a right to trial by jury before a district judge or magistrate judge. The magistrate judge may not proceed to try the case unless the defendant, after such explanation, expressly consents to be tried before the magistrate judge and expressly and specifically waives trial, judgment, and sentencing by a district judge. Any such consent and waiver shall be made in writing or orally on the record.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The controlling statute in this case has a different design, however. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(3) does not state that consent to preside over felony <i>voir dire</i> must be granted by following a procedure of similar clarity. As a general matter, where there is a full trial there are various points in the pretrial and trial process when rights either can be asserted or waived; and there is support in our cases for concluding that some of these rights cannot be waived absent the defendant's own consent. Whether the personal consent must be explicit and on the record or can be determined from a course of conduct may be another matter, but for now it suffices to note that we have acknowledged that some rights cannot be waived by the attorney alone. See <i>New York v. Hill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118324\"><a href=\"/opinion/118324/new-york-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 114-115, 120 S.Ct. 659, 145 L.Ed.2d 560 (2000).</p>\n<p>Citing some of our precedents on point, the Court in <i>Hill</i> gave this capsule discussion:</p>\n<blockquote>\"What suffices for waiver depends on the nature of the right at issue. `[W]hether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver; and whether the defendant's choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake.' <i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). For certain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an informed waiver. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Zerbst,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103050\"><a href=\"/opinion/103050/johnson-v-zerbst/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span>, 464-465, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938) (right to counsel); <i>Brookhart v.

For other rights, however, waiver may be effected by action of counsel. `Although there are basic rights that the attorney cannot waive without the fully informed and publicly acknowledged consent of the client, the lawyer has\u0097and must have\u0097 full authority to manage the conduct of the trial.' <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111986\"><a href=\"/opinion/111986/taylor-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 417-418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988). As to many decisions pertaining to the conduct of the trial, the defendant is `deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent and is considered to have \"notice of all facts, notice of which can be charged upon the attorney.\"' <i>Link v. Wabash R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106449\"><a href=\"/opinion/106449/link-v-wabash-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span>, 634, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (quoting <i>Smith v.

Absent a demonstration of ineffectiveness, counsel's word on such matters is the last.\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The issue in <i>Hill</i> was whether the attorney, acting without indication of particular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1770</span> consent from his client, could waive his client's statutory right to a speedy trial pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. The Court held that the attorney's statement, without any showing of the client's explicit consent, could waive the speedy trial right: \"Scheduling matters are plainly among those for which agreement by counsel generally controls.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 115, 120 S.Ct. 659.</p>\n<p>Giving the attorney control of trial management matters is a practical necessity. \"The adversary process could not function effectively if every tactical decision required client approval.\" <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111986\"><a href=\"/opinion/111986/taylor-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988). The presentation of a criminal defense can be a mystifying process even for well-informed laypersons. This is one of the reasons for the right to counsel. See <i>Powell v. Alabama,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1236300\"><a href=\"/opinion/1236300/powell-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 68-69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Defense Function 4-5.2, Commentary, p. 202 (3d ed. 1993) (\"Many of the rights of an accused, including constitutional rights, are such that only trained experts can comprehend their full significance, and an explanation to any but the most sophisticated client would be futile\"). Numerous choices affecting conduct of the trial, including the objections to make, the witnesses to call, and the arguments to advance, depend not only upon what is permissible under the rules of evidence and procedure but also upon tactical considerations of the moment and the larger strategic plan for the trial. These matters can be difficult to explain to a layperson; and to require in all instances that they be approved by the client could risk compromising the efficiencies and fairness that the trial process is designed to promote. In exercising professional judgment, moreover, the attorney draws upon the expertise and experience that members of the bar should bring to the trial process. In most instances the attorney will have a better understanding of the procedural choices than the client; or at least the law should so assume. See <i>Jones v. Barnes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111012\"><a href=\"/opinion/111012/jones-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span>, 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983); see also <i>Tollett v. Henderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108762\"><a href=\"/opinion/108762/tollett-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 267-268, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); cf. ABA Standards, <i>supra,</i> at 202 (\"Every experienced advocate can recall the disconcerting experience of trying to conduct the examination of a witness or follow opposing arguments or the judge's charge while the client `plucks at the attorney's sleeve' offering gratuitous suggestions\"). To hold that every instance of waiver requires the personal consent of the client himself or herself would be impractical.</p>\n<p>Similar to the scheduling matter in <i>Hill,</i> acceptance of a magistrate judge at the jury selection phase is a tactical decision that is well suited for the attorney's own decision. Under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the presiding judge has significant discretion over the structure of <i>voir dire.</i> The judge may ask questions of the jury pool or, as in this case, allow the attorneys for the parties to do so. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 24(a); App. 20. A magistrate judge's or a district judge's particular approach to <i>voir dire</i> both in substance\u0097the questions asked\u0097 and in tone\u0097formal or informal\u0097may be relevant in light of the attorney's own approach. The attorney may decide whether to accept the magistrate judge based in part on these factors. As with other tactical decisions, requiring personal, on-the-record approval from the client could necessitate a lengthy explanation the client might not understand at the moment and that might distract from more pressing matters as the attorney seeks to prepare the best defense. For these reasons we conclude that express consent by counsel suffices to permit a magistrate judge to preside over jury selection in a felony trial, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1771</span> pursuant to the authorization in \u00a7 636(b)(3).</p>\n<p>Our holding is not inconsistent with reading other precedents to hold that some basic trial choices are so important that an attorney must seek the client's consent in order to waive the right. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Florida v. Nixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137735\"><a href=\"/opinion/137735/florida-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span>, 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004) (identifying the choices \"`to plead guilty, waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or take an appeal'\" as examples (quoting <i>Jones, supra,</i> at 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308)). Petitioner argues that the decision to have a magistrate judge rather than an Article III judge preside at jury selection is a fundamental choice, cf. <i>Hill,</i> 528 U.S., at 114, 120 S.Ct. 659, or, at least, raises a question of constitutional significance so that we should interpret the Act to require an explicit personal statement of consent before the magistrate judge can proceed with jury selection.</p>\n<p>We conclude otherwise. Under the avoidance canon, \"when `a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.'\" <i>Harris v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, 555, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (quoting <i>United States ex rel.

The canon, however, does not apply unless there are \"serious concerns about the statute's constitutionality.\" <i>Harris, supra,</i> at 555, 122 S.Ct. 2406; see also <i>Reno v. Flores,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112833\"><a href=\"/opinion/112833/reno-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 314, n. 9, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993).</p>\n<p>Those concerns are not present here. Petitioner concedes that a magistrate judge is capable of competent and impartial performance of the judicial tasks involved in jury examination and selection. Reply Brief for Petitioner 12-13; see also <i>Peretz,</i> 501 U.S., at 935, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (\"The Act evinces a congressional belief that magistrates are well qualified to handle matters of similar importance to jury selection\"). The Act contains some features to ensure impartiality. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 631(i) (establishing requirements for removal), 632 (limiting concurrent employment), 634(b) (providing salary protection during the term). And \"`the district judge\u0097insulated by life tenure and irreducible salary\u0097is waiting in the wings, fully able to correct errors.'\" <i>Peretz, supra,</i> at 938, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (quoting <i>United States v. Raddatz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110315\"><a href=\"/opinion/110315/united-states-v-raddatz/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span>, 686, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980) (Blackmun, J., concurring)). Here petitioner made no objections to the rulings by the Magistrate Judge. Had objections been made, nothing in the record or the rules indicates that the District Judge could not have ruled on the issues, all with no delay or prejudice to any trial that had commenced. See <i>Peretz, supra,</i> at 935, n. 12, 939, 111 S.Ct. 2661. These factors support our determination that consent of counsel suffices to allow a magistrate judge to supervise <i>voir dire.</i> This is not a case where the magistrate judge is asked to preside or make determinations after the trial has commenced and it is arguably difficult or disruptive for a district judge to review any objections that might have been made to the magistrate judge's rulings.</p>\n<p>Petitioner notes that <i>Peretz</i> considered supervision over entire civil and misdemeanor trials comparable to presiding over <i>voir dire</i> at a felony trial. 501 U.S., at 933, 111 S.Ct. 2661. It follows, he argues, that \u00a7 636(b)(3) must require, as does 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(b), express personal consent by the defendant before a magistrate judge may preside over <i>voir dire.</i> But it is not obvious that Congress would have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1772</span> thought these matters required the same form of consent. Aside from the fact that the statutory text is different, there are relevant differences between presiding over a full trial and presiding over <i>voir dire.</i> Were petitioner correct, one would think the Act would require at least the same form of consent to authorize a magistrate judge to preside over either a civil or a misdemeanor trial (which <i>Peretz</i> also deemed to be of comparable importance). Our interpretation of the Act indicates otherwise. Compare \u00a7 3401(b), with <i>Roell v. Withrow,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127917\"><a href=\"/opinion/127917/roell-v-withrow/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 590, 123 S.Ct. 1696, 155 L.Ed.2d 775 (2003) (concluding that parties may authorize a full-time magistrate judge to preside over a civil trial via implied consent).</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that our view of the issue should be informed by <i>Gomez's</i> conclusion that having a magistrate judge during jury selection without consent is structural error, not subject to harmless-error review. See 490 U.S., at 876, 109 S.Ct. 2237. The exemption of certain errors from harmless-error review \"recognizes that some errors necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair.\" <i>Rose v. Clark,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111750\"><a href=\"/opinion/111750/rose-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, 577, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986); see also <i>id.,</i> at 577-578, 106 S.Ct. 3101. In petitioner's view, <i>Gomez</i> establishes that the issue in this case is of sufficient gravity or concern that personal consent must be required.</p>\n<p>The Court held in <i>Gomez</i> that imposition of a magistrate judge over objection was structural error, violating the basic right to a trial conducted at all critical stages by a judicial officer with appropriate jurisdiction. 490 U.S., at 876, 109 S.Ct. 2237. It does not follow, however, that this structural aspect requires an insistence on personal consent. Here, jurisdiction turns on consent; and for the reasons discussed above an attorney, acting on the client's behalf, can make an informed decision to allow the magistrate judge to exercise the jurisdiction Congress permits.</p>\n<p>Although a criminal defendant may demand that an Article III judge preside over the selection of a jury, the choice to do so reflects considerations more significant to the realm of the attorney than to the accused. Requiring the defendant to consent to a magistrate judge only by way of an on-the-record personal statement is not dictated by precedent and would burden the trial process, with little added protection for the defendant.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(3) a magistrate judge may preside over jury examination and jury selection only if the parties, or the attorneys for the parties, consent. Consent from an attorney will suffice. We do not have before us, and we do not address, an instance where the attorney states consent but the party by express and timely objection seeks to override his or her counsel. We need not decide, moreover, if consent may be inferred from a failure by a party and his or her attorney to object to the presiding by a magistrate judge. These issues are not presented here.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that no statute or rule requires that petitioner personally participate in the waiver of his right to have an Article III judge oversee <i>voir dire.</i> As to whether the Constitution requires that, the Court holds that it does not because it is a decision more tactical than fundamental\u0097\"more significant to the realm of the attorney than to the accused.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1772. I agree with the Court's conclusion, but not with the tactical-vs.-fundamental <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1773</span> test on which it is based.</p>\n<p>Petitioner and the Government do not dispute that petitioner's counsel consented to have a magistrate judge oversee <i>voir dire.</i> The issue is whether that consent\u0097 consent of counsel alone\u0097effected a valid waiver of petitioner's right to an Article III judge. It is important to bear in mind that we are not speaking here of action taken by counsel over his client's objection\u0097which would have the effect of revoking the agency with respect to the action in question. See <i>Brookhart v. Janis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107209\"><a href=\"/opinion/107209/brookhart-v-janis/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7-8, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966). There is no suggestion of that. The issue is whether consent expressed by counsel alone is ineffective simply because the defendant himself did not express to the court his consent.</p>\n<p>I think not. Our opinions have sometimes said in passing that, under the Constitution, certain \"fundamental\" or \"basic\" rights cannot be waived unless a defendant personally participates in the waiver. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111986\"><a href=\"/opinion/111986/taylor-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 417-418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988); <i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We have even repeated the suggestion in cases that actually involved the question whether a criminal defendant's attorney could waive a certain right\u0097but never in a case where the suggestion governed the disposition. In <i>New York v. Hill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118324\"><a href=\"/opinion/118324/new-york-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 659, 145 L.Ed.2d 560 (2000), although we noted that \"[f]or certain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an informed waiver,\" <i>id.,</i> at 114, 120 S.Ct. 659, we in fact found such a requirement inapplicable; and even that determination can be viewed as resting upon an interpretation of the statute creating the right that counsel had waived, see <i>id.,</i> at 115, 120 S.Ct. 659. And in <i>Florida v. Nixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137735\"><a href=\"/opinion/137735/florida-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004), although we said that \"counsel lacks authority to consent to a guilty plea on [his] client's behalf,\" <i>id.,</i> at 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, our holding was simply that counsel's concession of guilt to the jury did not amount to a guilty plea, <i>id.,</i> at 188, 125 S.Ct. 551, and did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, <i>id.,</i> at 192, 125 S.Ct. 551. As detailed in the margin, the decisions often cited for the principle of attorney incapacity are inapposite;<sup>[1]</sup> except <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1774</span> for one line of precedent, no decision of this Court holds that, as a constitutional matter, a defendant must personally waive certain of his \"fundamental\" rights\u0097which typically are identified as the rights to trial, jury, and counsel. The exceptional line of precedent involves the right to counsel. See <i>Johnson v. Zerbst,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103050\"><a href=\"/opinion/103050/johnson-v-zerbst/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span>, 464-465, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). But that right is essentially <i>sui generis,</i> since an unrepresented defendant cannot possibly waive his right to counsel except in person. Cases involving that right therefore provide no support for the principle that the Constitution sometimes forbids attorney waiver.</p>\n<p>Since a formula repeated in dictum but never the basis for judgment is not owed <i>stare decisis</i> weight, see <i>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142894\"><a href=\"/opinion/142894/lingle-v-chevron-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, 545-546, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876 (2005), our precedents have not established the rule of decision applicable in this case. I would not adopt the tactical-vs.-fundamental approach, which is vague and derives from nothing more substantial than this Court's say-so. One respected authority has noted that the approach has a \"potential for uncertainty,\" and that our precedents purporting to apply it \"have been brief and conclusionary.\" 3 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 11.6(a), (c), pp. 784, 796 (3d ed.2007). That is surely an understatement. What makes a right tactical? Depending on the circumstances, waiving <i>any</i> right can be a tactical decision. Even pleading guilty, which waives the right to trial, is highly tactical, since it usually requires balancing the prosecutor's plea bargain against the prospect of better and worse outcomes at trial.</p>\n<p>Whether a right is \"fundamental\" is equally mysterious. One would think that any right guaranteed by the Constitution would be fundamental. But I doubt many think that the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses cannot be waived by counsel. See <i>Diaz v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97561\"><a href=\"/opinion/97561/diaz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span>, 444, 452-453, 32 S.Ct. 250, 56 L.Ed. 500 (1912). Perhaps, then, specification in the Constitution is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for \"fundamental\" status. But if something more is necessary, I cannot imagine what it might be. Apart from constitutional guarantee, I know of no objective criterion for ranking rights. The Court concludes that the right to have an Article III judge oversee <i>voir dire</i> is not a fundamental right, <i>ante,</i> at 1770-1772, without answering whether it is even a constitutional right,<sup>[2]</sup> and without explaining what makes a right fundamental in the first place. The essence of \"fundamental\" rights continues to elude.</p>\n<p>I would therefore adopt the rule that, as a constitutional matter, all waivable rights (except, of course, the right to counsel) can be waived by counsel. There is no basis in the Constitution, or as far as I am aware in common-law practice, for distinguishing in this regard between a criminal defendant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1775</span> and his authorized representative. In fact, the very notion of representative litigation suggests that the Constitution draws no distinction between them. \"A prisoner . . . who defends by counsel, and silently acquiesces in what they agree to, is bound as any other principal by the act of his agent.\" <i>People v. Rathbun,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wend.</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></span>, 543 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1839). The <i>Rathbun</i> opinion, far from being the outlier view of a state court, was adopted as the common law position by eminent jurists of the 19th century, including Chief Justice Shaw of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. See <i>Commonwealth v. Dailey,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></span>, 83 (1853) (discussing <i>Rathbun</i> with approval in a case involving waiver of the right to a 12-man jury).</p>\n<p>It may well be desirable to require a defendant's personal waiver with regard to certain rights. Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, for example, provides that before accepting a guilty plea the court must \"address the defendant personally in open court,\" advise him of the consequences of his plea, and assure that the plea is voluntary. See also Rule 10(b) (waiver of right to appear at arraignment must be in writing signed by counsel and defendant). I do not contend that the Sixth Amendment's right to assistance of counsel prohibits such requirements of personal participation, at least where they do not impair counsel's expert assistance.</p>\n<p>Even without such rules it is certainly prudent, to forestall later challenges to counsel's conduct, for a trial court to satisfy itself of the defendant's personal consent to certain actions, such as entry of a guilty plea or waiver of jury trial, for which objective norms require an attorney to seek his client's authorization. See, <i>e.g.,</i> ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1.2(a) (2007) (\"In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client's decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify\"). But I know of no basis for saying that the <i>Constitution</i> automatically invalidates <i>any</i> trial action not taken by the defendant personally, though taken by his authorized counsel. I know of no way of determining, except by sheer prescription, which trial rights are <i>ex ante</i> and <i>by law</i> subject to such a limitation upon waiver. Assuredly the tactical-fundamental dichotomy does not do the trick. I would leave this matter of placing reasonable limits upon the right of agency in criminal trials to be governed by positive law, in statutes and rules of procedure.</p>\n<p>I would hold that petitioner's counsel's waiver was effective because no rule or statute provides that the waiver come from the defendant personally.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court holds today that neither the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 631 <i>et seq.,</i> nor the Constitution requires that a criminal defendant on trial for a felony personally give his informed consent before a magistrate judge may preside over jury selection. The Court proceeds from the premise, established in <i>Peretz v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112645\"><a href=\"/opinion/112645/peretz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">923</span></a></span>, 111 S.Ct. 2661, 115 L.Ed.2d 808 (1991), that the Federal Magistrates Act authorizes magistrate judges to preside over felony jury selection if the parties consent. I reject that premise, and for the reasons set forth below, would overrule <i>Peretz</i> and hold that the delegation of <i>voir dire</i> in this case was statutory error. I further conclude that the error may be corrected despite petitioner's failure to raise a timely objection in the District Court. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>This is the third time the Court has addressed the circumstances under which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1776</span> a district judge may delegate felony <i>voir dire</i> proceedings to a magistrate judge under the \"additional duties\" clause of the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(3). In <i>Gomez v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112280\"><a href=\"/opinion/112280/gomez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2237, 104 L.Ed.2d 923 (1989), the Court unanimously held that \u00a7 636(b)(3) does not authorize delegation of felony <i>voir dire</i> proceedings to a magistrate judge. Although the defendants in <i>Gomez</i> had objected to the delegation, neither the Court's reasoning nor its conclusion turned on that fact. Rather, the Court's interpretation of \u00a7 636(b)(3) rested primarily on two inferences drawn from the statutory scheme. First, the Court reasoned that Congress' \"carefully defined grant of authority to conduct trials of civil matters and of minor criminal cases should be construed as an implicit withholding of the authority to preside at a felony trial.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 872, 109 S.Ct. 2237. Second, the Court found it \"incongruous\" to assume that Congress intended felony jury selection to be among magistrate judges' additional duties but failed to provide an explicit standard of review as it had done for other duties described in the statute. <i>Id.,</i> at 874, 109 S.Ct. 2237. Neither of these inferences depended on the presence or absence of the parties' consent, and the Court's conclusion was accordingly unqualified: \"Congress . . . did not contemplate inclusion of jury selection in felony trials among a magistrate's additional duties.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 872, 109 S.Ct. 2237; see also <i>ibid.,</i> n. 25 (\"[W]e decide that the Federal Magistrates Act does not allow the delegation of jury selection to magistrates\"); <i>id.,</i> at 875-876, 109 S.Ct. 2237 (\"The absence of a specific reference to jury selection in the statute, or indeed, in the legislative history, persuades us that Congress did not intend the additional duties clause to embrace this function\" (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p>Two years later, the Court decided <i>Peretz.</i> Peretz's trial took place before this Court's decision in <i>Gomez,</i> and his attorney had agreed to the delegation of <i>voir dire,</i> assuring the Magistrate Judge that his client had consented. During the pendency of Peretz's appeal the Court decided <i>Gomez,</i> and Peretz argued that <i>Gomez</i> required reversal of his conviction. The Court of Appeals disagreed, concluding that he had waived any challenge to the Magistrate Judge's supervision of <i>voir dire.</i> Before this Court, the Government defended the Court of Appeals' holding as to waiver but confessed error with respect to the delegation of <i>voir dire,</i> \"agree[ing] with petitioner . . . that <i>Gomez</i> foreclose[d] the argument that the statute may be read to authorize magistrate-conducted voir dire when the defendant consents.\" Brief for United States in <i>Peretz v. United States</i><i>,</i> O.T.1990, No. 90-615, p. 9.</p>\n<p>Despite the Government's confession of error, the Court, \"[i]n an amazing display of interpretive gymnastics,\" <i>Peretz, supra,</i> at 940-941, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (Marshall, J., dissenting), held in a 5-to-4 decision that \u00a7 636(b)(3) does, after all, permit magistrate judges to conduct felony <i>voir dire</i> proceedings, so long as the parties consent. There is no need here to reproduce <i>Peretz's</i> flawed reasoning or to rehash the debate between the majority and dissenting opinions. Suffice it to say that, in my view, <i>Gomez</i> correctly interpreted \u00a7 636(b)(3) not to authorize delegation of felony jury selection regardless of the parties' consent, and I agree with the dissenters in <i>Peretz</i> that the Court's contrary conclusion in that case was based on a patently \"revisionist construction of the Act.\" 501 U.S., at 947, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (opinion of Marshall, J.).</p>\n<p>The only question, then, is whether to give <i>stare decisis</i> effect to <i>Peretz</i>'s erroneous conclusion that \u00a7 636(b)(3) authorizes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1777</span> magistrate judges to conduct felony jury selection if the parties consent. Although \"[i]t is true that we give stronger <i>stare decisis</i> effect to our holdings in statutory cases than in constitutional cases,\" that rule \"is not absolute, and we should not hesitate to allow our precedent to yield to the true meaning of an Act of Congress when our statutory precedent is `unworkable' or `badly reasoned.'\" <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137741\"><a href=\"/opinion/137741/clark-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 401-402, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). <i>Peretz</i> is both. Two considerations in particular convince me that <i>Peretz</i> should be overruled.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>First, <i>Peretz</i> leaves the Court with no principled way to decide the statutory question presented in this case. Contrary to the Court's suggestion, the question presented here is not whether \"every instance of waiver requires the personal consent of the client,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1770; rather, it is the far narrower question whether \u00a7 636(b)(3) requires the defendant's personal consent before felony jury selection may be delegated to a magistrate judge. The Court answers this question in the negative, but does not point to anything in \u00a7 636(b)(3) or in the broader statutory scheme that supports its conclusion. It does not because it cannot. Not having provided for delegation of felony <i>voir dire</i> proceedings under the additional duties clause, Congress of course did not specify whether the parties' consent is required. And \"[b]ecause the additional duties clause contains no language predicating delegation of an additional duty upon litigant consent, it likewise contains nothing indicating what constitutes `consent' to the delegation of an additional duty.\" <i>Peretz, supra,</i> at 947, n. 6, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Congress' silence is particularly telling in the context of the Federal Magistrates Act. Elsewhere in the Act, Congress took great care to specify whether and in what manner the litigants must consent before a magistrate judge may assume significant duties. In \u00a7 636(c)(1), for example, Congress provided that full-time magistrate judges may conduct civil trials \"[u]pon the consent of the parties,\" and that part-time magistrate judges may do so \"[u]pon the consent of the parties, pursuant to their specific written request.\" Congress further provided in \u00a7 636(c)(2) that \"[t]he decision of the parties shall be communicated to the clerk of court,\" and, if the parties do not consent, the district judge may not raise the matter again without \"advis[ing] the parties that they are free to withhold consent without adverse substantive consequences.\" I have previously explained at length why \u00a7 636(c) is best read to require the express consent of the parties, see <i>Roell v. Withrow,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127917\"><a href=\"/opinion/127917/roell-v-withrow/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 591-597, 123 S.Ct. 1696, 155 L.Ed.2d 775 (2003) (dissenting opinion), and I will not repeat that discussion here, other than to point out that Congress obviously focused on the issue and gave detailed instructions regarding the form of the parties' consent.</p>\n<p>Even more telling is that Congress required the defendant's express, informed consent before a magistrate judge may conduct a misdemeanor trial. Section 636(a)(3) authorizes magistrate judges to conduct certain misdemeanor trials \"in conformity with and subject to the limitations of\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401, which spells out in detail the manner in which the defendant must consent:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The magistrate judge shall carefully explain to the defendant that he has a right to trial, judgment, and sentencing by a district judge and that he may have a right to trial by jury before a district judge or magistrate judge. The magistrate judge may not proceed to try the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1778</span> case unless the defendant, after such explanation, expressly consents to be tried before the magistrate judge and expressly and specifically waives trial, judgment, and sentencing by a district judge. Any such consent and waiver shall be made in writing or orally on the record.\" \u00a7 3401(b).</blockquote>\n<p>The Court recites the language of \u00a7 3401(b), but gives it no weight in its analysis. It recognizes that \"[t]here are instances in federal criminal proceedings where the procedural requisites for consent are specified and a right cannot be waived except with a defendant's own informed consent.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1768. But it is given no pause by the fact that the Federal Magistrates Act, the very statute it interprets to permit delegation of <i>felony</i> proceedings without the defendant's \"own informed consent,\" expressly requires such consent before a magistrate judge may conduct a <i>misdemeanor</i> trial. Instead, the Court worries that \"requiring personal, on-the-record approval from the client could necessitate a lengthy explanation the client might not understand at the moment and that might distract from more pressing matters,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1770, heedless of the fact that Congress plainly viewed any such \"burden[s] [on] the trial process,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1772, as outweighed by the need to obtain the defendant's personal consent before a magistrate judge may preside, even over a misdemeanor trial.</p>\n<p>The Court glides over this glaring anomaly, asserting that \"[t]he controlling statute in this case has a different design,\" and \"does not state that consent to preside over felony <i>voir dire</i> must be granted by following a procedure of similar clarity.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1769. But there is only one statute at issue here\u0097the Federal Magistrates Act expressly incorporates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(b)\u0097and the fact that it does not mandate \"a procedure of similar clarity\" for delegation of felony jury selection is hardly surprising, since \u00a7 636(b)(3)\u0097 which provides in its entirety that \"[a] magistrate judge may be assigned such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States\"\u0097says not a word about delegation of felony jury selection, much less about whether and in what form the parties must consent.</p>\n<p>The Court further suggests that \u00a7 3401(b) is inconsequential because \"there are relevant differences between presiding over a full trial and presiding over <i>voir dire.</i>\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1772. But even <i>Peretz</i> recognized that \"supervision of entire civil and misdemeanor trials\" is \"comparable in responsibility and importance to presiding over <i>voir dire</i> at a felony trial.\" 501 U.S., at 933, 111 S.Ct. 2661. And of course, it was Congress' omission of any mode of consent for delegation of felony proceedings, in contradistinction to its detailed treatment of the consent required for delegation of civil and misdemeanor trials, that drove <i>Gomez's</i> analysis. 490 U.S., at 872, 109 S.Ct. 2237 (\"[T]he carefully defined grant of authority to conduct trials of civil matters and of minor criminal cases should be construed as an implicit withholding of the authority to preside at a felony trial\"); see also <i>Peretz, supra,</i> at 955, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"By specifically authorizing magistrates to perform duties in civil and misdemeanor trials, and specifying the manner in which parties were to express their consent in those situations, the statute suggested <i>absence</i> of authority to preside over felony trials through some (unspecified) mode of consent\"). Today's decision is truly an ironic reversal. The Court once thought that Congress' differential treatment of felony jury selection and misdemeanor trials was a reason to believe that Congress had <i>entirely withheld</i> authority to preside over felony jury selection. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1779</span> Today, however, the Court says that the \"relevant differences\" between these responsibilities support the conclusion that Congress permitted delegation of felony jury selection upon a <i>lesser showing</i> of consent than that required for delegation of a misdemeanor trial.</p>\n<p>In the end, I am sympathetic to petitioner's argument that \u00a7 636(b)(3) should be read <i>in pari materia</i> with \u00a7 3401(b). See Brief for Petitioner 38 (\"If, in enacting the [Federal Magistrates Act] Congress believed a defendant's explicit, personal consent was constitutionally necessary to bestow authority upon a magistrate judge in federal misdemeanor cases, then <i>a fortiori</i> Congress would have believed that such explicit, personal consent is necessary to permit a magistrate judge to conduct felony jury selection\"). And I share his view that Congress undoubtedly would have adopted something akin to \u00a7 3401(b)'s requirements had it authorized delegation of felony jury selection. See <i>Peretz, supra,</i> at 947, n. 6, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\"I would think, however, that the standard governing a party's consent to delegation of a portion of a felony trial under the additional duties clause should be at least as strict as that governing delegation of a misdemeanor trial to a magistrate\").</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I do not believe that <i>Peretz's</i> erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 636(b)(3) gives me license to rewrite the Federal Magistrates Act to reflect what I think Congress would have done had it contemplated delegation of felony jury selection or foreseen the Court's decision in <i>Peretz.</i> Cf. Brief for Petitioner 33 (\"What the Court is left to do in petitioner's case is to fill the gap by determining what Congress would have done in enacting the [Federal Magistrates Act] had it expressly addressed the `crucial' consent issue\" (footnote omitted)). Where, as here, a mistaken interpretation of a statute leaves the Court with no principled way to answer subsequent questions that arise under the statute, it seems to me that the better course is simply to acknowledge and correct the error. Cf. <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, 578, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>A second reason why I would not give <i>stare decisis</i> effect to <i>Peretz</i> is that it requires us to wade into a constitutional morass. In <i>Gomez,</i> the Court declined to decide whether the Constitution permits delegation of felony jury selection to a magistrate judge. 490 U.S., at 872, n. 25, 109 S.Ct. 2237. <i>Peretz</i> simply brushed aside that difficult constitutional question. See 501 U.S., at 936, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (\"There is no constitutional infirmity in the delegation of felony trial jury selection to a magistrate when the litigants consent\"); cf. <i>id.,</i> at 948-952, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (discussing the \"serious constitutional question\" \"whether jury selection by a magistrate\u0097even when a defendant consents\u0097is consistent with Article III\"); <i>id.,</i> at 956, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (not resolving \"the serious and difficult constitutional questions raised by the [majority's] construction,\" but suggesting that the Court's reasoning rendered \"the doctrine of unconstitutional delegation\" \"a dead letter\").</p>\n<p>Today the Court's result requires it to go even further. In addition to reaffirming <i>Peretz's</i> questionable holding that the Constitution permits delegation of felony <i>voir dire</i> proceedings to a non-Article III judge, the Court decides that a criminal defendant's waiver of his right to an Article III judge need not be personal and informed. The Court treats this as an easy question, concluding that the choice between an Article III judge and a magistrate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1780</span> judge is not among those \"basic trial choices,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1771, that require a defendant's personal consent because \"a magistrate judge is capable of competent and impartial performance of the judicial tasks involved in jury examination and selection,\" and because magistrate judges are supervised by Article III judges, <i>ante,</i> at 1771, 1772. Under our precedents, however, the question is not so easily dispatched.</p>\n<p>Our cases shed little light on whether and when a criminal defendant must personally waive a constitutional right. Although we have previously stated that, \"[f]or certain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an informed waiver,\" <i>New York v. Hill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118324\"><a href=\"/opinion/118324/new-york-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 114, 120 S.Ct. 659, 145 L.Ed.2d 560 (2000), many of the cases we have cited for that proposition do not in fact stand for it. For example, we have cited <i>Brookhart v. Janis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107209\"><a href=\"/opinion/107209/brookhart-v-janis/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966), for the proposition that the defendant's personal consent is required for a waiver of his right to plead not guilty. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Hill, supra,</i> at 114, 120 S.Ct. 659. But <i>Brookhart's</i> holding was narrower. The only question presented there was \"whether counsel has power to enter a plea <i>which is inconsistent with his client's expressed desire</i> and thereby waive his client's constitutional right to plead not guilty and have a trial in which he can confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him.\" 384 U.S., at 7, 86 S.Ct. 1245 (emphasis added). <i>Brookhart</i> thus did not decide whether the Constitution prohibits counsel from entering a guilty plea on his client's behalf in cases where the defendant has not expressed a contrary desire.</p>\n<p>Similarly, <i>Patton v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101558\"><a href=\"/opinion/101558/patton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span>, 50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854 (1930), a case often cited for the proposition that the right to a jury trial can be waived only by the defendant personally, does not draw a clear distinction between the defendant's own consent and that of his attorney. The Court stated in dicta that \"the express and intelligent consent of the defendant\" is required \"before any waiver [of the right to a jury trial] can become effective.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 312, 50 S.Ct. 253. But that requirement appears to have been satisfied in <i>Patton</i> by counsel's representation to the trial court that he had conferred with his clients and obtained their consent. <i>Id.,</i> at 286-287, 50 S.Ct. 253.</p>\n<p>Our cases thus provide little relevant guidance. Justice SCALIA may well be correct that, as a matter of first principles, there is no right (other than perhaps the <i>sui generis</i> right to counsel) that cannot be waived by a defendant's attorney, acting as the duly authorized agent of his client. See <i>ante,</i> at 1768 (opinion concurring in judgment). But if I were to accept the Court's oft-repeated dictum that there are certain fundamental rights that can be waived only by the defendant personally, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Florida v. Nixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137735\"><a href=\"/opinion/137735/florida-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span>, 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004) (\"[C]ertain decisions regarding the exercise or waiver of basic trial rights are of such moment that they cannot be made for the defendant by a surrogate\"); <i>Hill, supra,</i> at 114, 120 S.Ct. 659; <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111986\"><a href=\"/opinion/111986/taylor-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 417-418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988) (\"[T]here are basic rights that the attorney cannot waive without the fully informed and publicly acknowledged consent of the client\"), I see no reason why the right to an Article III judge should not be among them.</p>\n<p>There is no apparent reason, for example, why the right to an Article III judge should be deemed any less fundamental, or its exercise any more \"`tactical,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 1770 (opinion of the Court) (quoting <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 418, 108 S.Ct. 646), than the right to a jury trial. The Framers viewed independent judges, no less than the right to a jury of one's peers, as indispensable to a fair trial. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1781</span> <i>Hatter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118428\"><a href=\"/opinion/118428/united-states-v-hatter/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span>, 568-569, 121 S.Ct. 1782, 149 L.Ed.2d 820 (2001) (discussing the Framers' overriding concern for an independent Judiciary and quoting Chief Justice Marshall's statement that the \"`greatest scourge . . . ever inflicted'\" \"`was an ignorant, a corrupt, or a dependent Judiciary'\" (quoting Proceedings and Debates of the Virginia State Convention, of 1829-1830, p. 619 (1830))). For that reason, the Constitution affords Article III judges the structural protections of life tenure and salary protection. Art. III, \u00a7 1. The Court's observation that \"a magistrate judge is capable of competent and impartial performance\" of judicial duties, <i>ante,</i> at 1772, is thus beside the point.<sup>[*]</sup> Magistrate judges do not enjoy the structural protections of Article III: They serve 8-year terms and may be removed for cause, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 631(e), (i), and they are subject to diminution of their salaries and outright abolition of their offices by Congress. Accordingly, whatever their virtues, magistrate judges are no substitute for Article III judges in the eyes of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>In short, if I accepted the Court's dictum that the right to a jury trial may be waived only by the defendant personally, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Nixon, supra,</i> at 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, I would be hard pressed to conclude that waiver of the right to an Article III judge during a critical stage of a felony trial requires anything less. That said, I include this brief discussion of the constitutional issues this case presents not because I would decide them, but to point out that the Court gives them short shrift. These are serious constitutional questions, see <i>Roell,</i> 538 U.S., at 595, 123 S.Ct. 1696 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), and they are posed only because of <i>Peretz</i>'s erroneous interpretation of the Federal Magistrates Act. Indeed, I suspect that Congress withheld from magistrate judges the authority to preside during felony trials precisely in order to avoid the constitutional questions <i>Peretz</i> now thrusts upon us. Again, rather than plow headlong into this constitutional thicket, the better choice is simply to overrule <i>Peretz.</i> Cf. <i>Peretz,</i> 501 U.S., at 952, 111 S.Ct. 2661 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (finding the Court's resolution of difficult <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1782</span> Article III questions \"particularly unfortunate\" where \"the most coherent reading of the Federal Magistrates Act avoids these problems entirely\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Because I conclude that <i>Peretz</i> should be overruled, and that the District Court therefore erred in delegating <i>voir dire</i> to the Magistrate Judge, I must also address the Government's alternative argument that petitioner forfeited his claim by failing to object to the delegation. Petitioner's failure to object, the Government contends, means that he cannot prevail unless he satisfies the requirements of the plain-error rule. It is true that petitioner did not raise a timely objection to the District Court's delegation of <i>voir dire.</i> And petitioner cannot satisfy the plain-error rule because the statutory error below\u0097unauthorized delegation of <i>voir dire</i> to a magistrate judge\u0097was not \"plain\" under <i>Peretz.</i></p>\n<p>Not all uncontested errors, however, are subject to the plain-error rule. In limited circumstances, we have \"agreed to correct, at least on direct review, violations of a statutory provision that embodies a strong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial business even though the defect was not raised in a timely manner.\" <i>Nguyen v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130145\"><a href=\"/opinion/130145/nguyen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 78, 123 S.Ct. 2130, 156 L.Ed.2d 64 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <i>Nguyen,</i> a non-Article III judge sat by designation on the Ninth Circuit panel that affirmed petitioners' convictions. Petitioners failed to object to the composition of the panel in the Ninth Circuit and raised the issue for the first time in their petitions for certiorari. Because the Ninth Circuit panel \"contravened the statutory requirements set by Congress for the composition of the federal courts of appeals,\" <i>id.,</i> at 80, 123 S.Ct. 2130, and because those requirements \"embodie[d] weighty congressional policy concerning the proper organization of the federal courts,\" <i>id.,</i> at 79, 123 S.Ct. 2130, we held that petitioners' failure to object did not preclude relief. We specifically declined to apply the plain-error rule:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It is true, as the Government observes, that a failure to object to trial error ordinarily limits an appellate court to review for plain error. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111; Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b). But to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners' part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld. Even if the parties had <i>expressly</i> stipulated to the participation of a non-Article III judge in the consideration of their appeals, no matter how distinguished and well qualified the judge might be, such a stipulation would not have cured the plain defect in the composition of the panel.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 80-81[, 123 S.Ct. 2130].</blockquote>\n<p>I see no reason to treat this case differently than <i>Nguyen.</i> Just as \"Congress' decision to preserve the Article III character of the courts of appeals [was] more than a trivial concern\" in that case, <i>id.,</i> at 80, 123 S.Ct. 2130, so too here Congress' decision to preserve the Article III character of felony trials \"embodies weighty congressional policy concerning the proper organization of the federal courts,\" <i>id.,</i> at 79, 123 S.Ct. 2130. Accordingly, as in <i>Nguyen,</i> the Court can and should correct the error in this case despite petitioner's failure to raise a timely objection below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  On the right to jury, <i>Thompson v.

The Court later questioned whether <i>Thompson</i> even held that, and went on to hold that the right is waivable. See <i>Patton v.

See <i>id.,</i> at 7-8, 86 S.Ct. 1245. Other decisions have said that waiver of the right to trial must be knowing and voluntary, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Brady v.

Even if, in the case of waiver by counsel, the knowing and voluntary requirement applies to the defendant himself, that still permits counsel to waive on behalf of an informed and agreeing client.

The Court reassures itself by hypothesizing that the District Court could have ruled on any objections to the Magistrate Judge's rulings. <i>Ante,</i> at 1771-1772. But the Court once \"harbor[ed] serious doubts\" that a district judge who was not present during jury selection could \"meaningfully\" review a magistrate judge's rulings, <i>Gomez v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112280\"><a href=\"/opinion/112280/gomez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span>, 874, 109 S.Ct. 2237, 104 L.Ed.2d 923 (1989), because \"no transcript can recapture the atmosphere of the <i>voir dire,</i>\" <i>id.,</i> at 875, 109 S.Ct. 2237. The Court does not explain what has intervened to dispel those doubts. And even if district judges could meaningfully review magistrate judges' <i>voir dire</i> rulings, that would not change the fact that magistrate judges are subject to outside influences in ways that Article III judges are not. As Judge Posner has explained:\n</p>\n<p>\"The fact that the appointing power has been given to Article III judges is the opposite of reassuring. It makes magistrates beholden to judges as well as to Congress . . . . The Constitution built internal checks and balances into the legislative branch by making Congress bicameral and into the judicial branch by guaranteeing all federal judges\u0097 not just Supreme Court Justices, or appellate judges generally\u0097tenure during good behavior and protection against pay cuts. Appellate judges can reverse district judges, can mandamus them, can criticize them, can remand a case to another judge, but cannot fire district judges, cow them, or silence them\u0097 cannot prevent them from making independent judgments and expressing independent views. . . . [A]s long as [district judges] enjoy the tenure and compensation protections of Article III, they are independent of [those] who appointed them . . . . Magistrates do not have those protections; the judges control their reappointment.\" <i>Geras v.
