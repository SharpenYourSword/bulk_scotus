Argued January 9, 2008—Decided April 28, 2008*\nAfter Indiana enacted an election law (SEA 483) requiring citizens vot-\n  ing in person to present government-issued photo identification, peti-\n  tioners filed separate suits challenging the law’s constitutionality.\n  Following discovery, the District Court granted respondents sum-\n  mary judgment, finding the evidence in the record insufficient to\n  support a facial attack on the statute’s validity. In affirming, the\n  Seventh Circuit declined to judge the law by the strict standard set\n  for poll taxes in Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663,\n  finding the burden on voters offset by the benefit of reducing the risk\n  of fraud.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n472 F. 3d 949, affirmed.\n    JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE KEN-\n  NEDY, concluded that the evidence in the record does not support a fa-\n  cial attack on SEA 483’s validity. Pp. 5–20.\n    (a) Under Harper, even rational restrictions on the right to vote are\n  invidious if they are unrelated to voter qualifications. However,\n  “even handed restrictions” protecting the “integrity and reliability of\n  the electoral process itself” satisfy Harper’s standard. Anderson v.\n  Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788, n. 9. A state law’s burden on a politi-\n  cal party, an individual voter, or a discrete class of voters must be\n  justified by relevant and legitimate state interests “sufficiently\n  weighty to justify the limitation.” Norman v.

MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    288–289. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) Each of Indiana’s asserted interests is unquestionably relevant\n    to its interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the elec-\n    toral process. The first is the interest in deterring and detecting\n    voter fraud. Indiana has a valid interest in participating in a na-\n    tionwide effort to improve and modernize election procedures criti-\n    cized as antiquated and inefficient. Indiana also claims a particular\n    interest in preventing voter fraud in response to the problem of voter\n    registration rolls with a large number of names of persons who are\n    either deceased or no longer live in Indiana. While the record con-\n    tains no evidence that the fraud SEA 483 addresses—in-person voter\n    impersonation at polling places—has actually occurred in Indiana,\n    such fraud has occurred in other parts of the country, and Indiana’s\n    own experience with voter fraud in a 2003 mayoral primary demon-\n    strates a real risk that voter fraud could affect a close election’s out-\n    come. There is no question about the legitimacy or importance of a\n    State’s interest in counting only eligible voters’ votes. Finally, Indi-\n    ana’s interest in protecting public confidence in elections, while\n    closely related to its interest in preventing voter fraud, has inde-\n    pendent significance, because such confidence encourages citizen par-\n    ticipation in the democratic process. Pp. 7–13.\n       (c) The relevant burdens here are those imposed on eligible voters\n    who lack photo identification cards that comply with SEA 483. Be-\n    cause Indiana’s cards are free, the inconvenience of going to the Bu-\n    reau of Motor Vehicles, gathering required documents, and posing for\n    a photograph does not qualify as a substantial burden on most voters’\n    right to vote, or represent a significant increase over the usual bur-\n    dens of voting. The severity of the somewhat heavier burden that\n    may be placed on a limited number of persons—e.g., elderly persons\n    born out-of-state, who may have difficulty obtaining a birth certifi-\n    cate—is mitigated by the fact that eligible voters without photo iden-\n    tification may cast provisional ballots that will be counted if they\n    execute the required affidavit at the circuit court clerk’s office. Even\n    assuming that the burden may not be justified as to a few voters, that\n    conclusion is by no means sufficient to establish petitioners’ right to\n    the relief they seek. Pp. 13–16.\n       (d) Petitioners bear a heavy burden of persuasion in seeking to in-\n    validate SEA 483 in all its applications. This Court’s reasoning in\n    Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552\n    U. S. ___, applies with added force here. Petitioners argue that Indi-\n    ana’s interests do not justify the burden imposed on voters who can-\n    not afford or obtain a birth certificate and who must make a second\n    trip to the circuit court clerk’s office, but it is not possible to quantify,\n    based on the evidence in the record, either that burden’s magnitude\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  or the portion of the burden that is fully justified. A facial challenge\n  must fail where the statute has a “ ‘plainly legitimate sweep.’ ” Id., at\n  ___. When considering SEA 483’s broad application to all Indiana\n  voters, it “imposes only a limited burden on voters’ rights.” Burdick\n  v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 439. The “precise interests” advanced by\n  Indiana are therefore sufficient to defeat petitioners’ facial challenge.\n  Id., at 434. Pp. 16–20.\n     (e) Valid neutral justifications for a nondiscriminatory law, such as\n  SEA 483, should not be disregarded simply because partisan inter-\n  ests may have provided one motivation for the votes of individual leg-\n  islators. P. 20.\n     JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE ALITO, was\n  of the view that petitioners’ premise that the voter-identification law\n  might have imposed a special burden on some voters is irrelevant.\n  The law should be upheld because its overall burden is minimal and\n  justified. A law respecting the right to vote should be evaluated un-\n  der the approach in Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, which calls for\n  application of a deferential, “important regulatory interests” stan-\n  dard for nonsevere, nondiscriminatory restrictions, reserving strict\n  scrutiny for laws that severely restrict the right to vote, id., at 433–\n  434. The different ways in which Indiana’s law affects different vot-\n  ers are no more than different impacts of the single burden that the\n  law uniformly imposes on all voters: To vote in person, everyone must\n  have and present a photo identification that can be obtained for free.\n  This is a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation.\n  The law’s universally applicable requirements are eminently reason-\n  able because the burden of acquiring, possessing, and showing a free\n  photo identification is not a significant increase over the usual voting\n  burdens, and the State’s stated interests are sufficient to sustain that\n  minimal burden.

Id., at 807.6\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 472\nF. 3d 949 (CA7 2007). The majority first held that the\nDemocrats had standing to bring a facial challenge to the\nconstitutionality of SEA 483. Next, noting the absence of\nany plaintiffs who claimed that the law would deter them\nfrom voting, the Court of Appeals inferred that “the moti-\nvation for the suit is simply that the law may require the\nDemocratic Party and the other organizational plaintiffs\nto work harder to get every last one of their supporters to\nthe polls.” Id., at 952. It rejected the argument that the\nlaw should be judged by the same strict standard applica-\nble to a poll tax because the burden on voters was offset by\nthe benefit of reducing the risk of fraud. The dissenting\njudge, viewing the justification for the law as “hollow”—\nmore precisely as “a not-too-thinly-veiled attempt to dis-\ncourage election-day turnout by certain folks believed to\nskew Democratic”—would have applied a stricter stan-\ndard, something he described as “close to ‘strict scrutiny\nlight.’ ” Id., at 954, 956 (opinion of Evans, J.).

Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663\n(1966), the Court held that Virginia could not condition\nthe right to vote in a state election on the payment of a\npoll tax of $1.50. We rejected the dissenters’ argument\nthat the interest in promoting civic responsibility by weed-\ning out those voters who did not care enough about public\naffairs to pay a small sum for the privilege of voting pro-\nvided a rational basis for the tax. See id., at 685 (opinion\nof Harlan, J.). Applying a stricter standard, we concluded\nthat a State “violates the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment whenever it makes the affluence\nof the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard.”\nId., at 666 (opinion of the Court). We used the term “in-\nvidiously discriminate” to describe conduct prohibited\nunder that standard, noting that we had previously held\nthat while a State may obviously impose “reasonable\nresidence restrictions on the availability of the ballot,” it\n“may not deny the opportunity to vote to a bona fide resi-\ndent merely because he is a member of the armed ser-\nvices.” Id., at 666–667 (citing Carrington v. Rash, 380\nU. S. 89, 96 (1965)). Although the State’s justification for\nthe tax was rational, it was invidious because it was ir-\nrelevant to the voter’s qualifications.\n   Thus, under the standard applied in Harper, even ra-\ntional restrictions on the right to vote are invidious if they\n——————\n  7 We also agree with the unanimous view of those judges that the\nDemocrats have standing to challenge the validity of SEA 483 and that\nthere is no need to decide whether the other petitioners also have\nstanding.\n6        CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                       Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nare unrelated to voter qualifications. In Anderson v.\nCelebrezze, 460 U. S. 780 (1983), however, we confirmed\nthe general rule that “evenhanded restrictions that protect\nthe integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself”\nare not invidious and satisfy the standard set forth in\nHarper. 460 U. S., at 788, n. 9. Rather than applying any\n“litmus test” that would neatly separate valid from invalid\nrestrictions, we concluded that a court must identify and\nevaluate the interests put forward by the State as justifi-\ncations for the burden imposed by its rule, and then make\nthe “hard judgment” that our adversary system demands.\n   In later election cases we have followed Anderson’s\nbalancing approach. Thus, in Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S.\n279, 288–289 (1992), after identifying the burden Illinois\nimposed on a political party’s access to the ballot, we\n“called for the demonstration of a corresponding interest\nsufficiently weighty to justify the limitation,” and con-\ncluded that the “severe restriction” was not justified by a\nnarrowly drawn state interest of compelling importance.\nLater, in Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428 (1992), we\napplied Anderson’s standard for “ ‘reasonable, nondis-\ncriminatory restrictions,’ ” 504 U. S., at 434, and upheld\nHawaii’s prohibition on write-in voting despite the fact\nthat it prevented a significant number of “voters from\nparticipating in Hawaii elections in a meaningful man-\nner.” Id., at 443 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). We reaffirmed\nAnderson’s requirement that a court evaluating a constitu-\ntional challenge to an election regulation weigh the as-\nserted injury to the right to vote against the “ ‘precise\ninterests put forward by the State as justifications for the\nburden imposed by its rule.’ ” 504 U. S., at 434 (quoting\nAnderson, 460 U. S., at 789).8\n——————\n  8 Contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion, see post, at 2 (opinion\n\nconcurring in judgment), our approach remains faithful to Anderson\nand Burdick. The Burdick opinion was explicit in its endorsement and\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

However slight that burden\nmay appear, as Harper demonstrates, it must be justified\nby relevant and legitimate state interests “sufficiently\nweighty to justify the limitation.” Norman, 502 U. S.,\nat 288–289. We therefore begin our analysis of the con-\nstitutionality of Indiana’s statute by focusing on those\ninterests.\n                               II\n   The State has identified several state interests that\narguably justify the burdens that SEA 483 imposes on\nvoters and potential voters. While petitioners argue that\nthe statute was actually motivated by partisan concerns\nand dispute both the significance of the State’s interests\nand the magnitude of any real threat to those interests,\nthey do not question the legitimacy of the interests the\nState has identified. Each is unquestionably relevant to\nthe State’s interest in protecting the integrity and reliabil-\nity of the electoral process.\n   The first is the interest in deterring and detecting voter\nfraud. The State has a valid interest in participating in a\nnationwide effort to improve and modernize election pro-\ncedures that have been criticized as antiquated and ineffi-\ncient.9 The State also argues that it has a particular\n——————\nadherence to Anderson, see 504 U. S., at 434, and repeatedly cited\nAnderson, see 504 U. S., at 436, n. 5, 440, n. 9, 441. To be sure, Burdick\nrejected the argument that strict scrutiny applies to all laws imposing a\nburden on the right to vote; but in its place, the Court applied the\n“ ‘flexible standard’ ” set forth in Anderson. Burdick surely did not\ncreate a novel “deferential ‘important regulatory interests’ standard.”\nSee post, at 1–2.\n    9 See National Commission on Federal Election Reform, To Assure\n\nPride and Confidence in the Electoral Process 18 (2002) (with Honorary\nCo-chairs former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter).\n8       CRAWFORD v.

Each of these\ninterests merits separate comment.\nElection Modernization\n   Two recently enacted federal statutes have made it\nnecessary for States to reexamine their election proce-\ndures.

The statute requires state motor vehi-\ncle driver’s license applications to serve as voter registra-\ntion applications. §1973gg–3. While that requirement has\nincreased the number of registered voters, the statute also\ncontains a provision restricting States’ ability to remove\nnames from the lists of registered voters. §1973gg–6(a)(3).\nThese protections have been partly responsible for inflated\nlists of registered voters. For example, evidence credited\nby Judge Barker estimated that as of 2004 Indiana’s voter\nrolls were inflated by as much as 41.4%, see 458 F. Supp.\n2d, at 793, and data collected by the Election Assistance\nCommittee in 2004 indicated that 19 of 92 Indiana coun-\nties had registration totals exceeding 100% of the 2004\nvoting-age population, Dept. of Justice Complaint in\nUnited States v.

HAVA\nalso requires the States to verify voter information con-\ntained in a voter registration application and specifies\neither an “applicant’s driver’s license number” or “the last\n4 digits of the applicant’s social security number” as\nacceptable verifications. §15483(a)(5)(A)(i). If an indi-\nvidual has neither number, the State is required to\nassign the applicant a voter identification number.\n§15483(a)(5)(A)(ii).\n   HAVA also imposes new identification requirements for\nindividuals registering to vote for the first time who sub-\nmit their applications by mail. If the voter is casting his\nballot in person, he must present local election officials\nwith written identification, which may be either “a current\nand valid photo identification” or another form of docu-\nmentation such as a bank statement or paycheck.\n§15483(b)(2)(A). If the voter is voting by mail, he must\ninclude a copy of the identification with his ballot. A voter\nmay also include a copy of the documentation with his\napplication or provide his driver’s license number or Social\nSecurity number for verification. §15483(b)(3). Finally, in\na provision entitled “Fail-safe voting,” HAVA authorizes\nthe casting of provisional ballots by challenged voters.\n§15483(b)(2)(B).\n   Of course, neither HAVA nor NVRA required Indiana to\nenact SEA 483, but they do indicate that Congress be-\nlieves that photo identification is one effective method of\nestablishing a voter’s qualification to vote and that the\nintegrity of elections is enhanced through improved tech-\nnology. That conclusion is also supported by a report\nissued shortly after the enactment of SEA 483 by the\nCommission on Federal Election Reform chaired by former\nPresident Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State\nJames A. Baker III, which is a part of the record in these\ncases. In the introduction to their discussion of voter\n10       CRAWFORD v.

In the old days and in small towns where\n     everyone knows each other, voters did not need to\n     identify themselves.

The average precinct size in the United States has\nincreased in the last century, suggesting that it is less likely that poll\nworkers will be personally acquainted with voters. For example, at\nthe time Joseph Harris wrote his groundbreaking 1934 report\non election administration, Indiana restricted the number of voters\nin each precinct to 250.        J.

Moreover, the interest in orderly administration\nand accurate recordkeeping provides a sufficient justifica-\ntion for carefully identifying all voters participating in the\nelection process. While the most effective method of pre-\nventing election fraud may well be debatable, the propri-\nety of doing so is perfectly clear.\n   In its brief, the State argues that the inflation of its\nvoter rolls provides further support for its enactment of\nSEA 483.

While the brief indicates that the\nrecord evidence of in-person fraud was overstated because much of the\nfraud was actually absentee ballot fraud or voter registration fraud,\nthere remain scattered instances of in-person voter fraud. For example,\nafter a hotly contested gubernatorial election in 2004, Washington\nconducted an investigation of voter fraud and uncovered 19 “ghost\nvoters.” Borders v. King Cty., No. 05–2–00027–3 (Super. Ct. Chelan\nCty., Wash., June 6, 2005) (verbatim report of unpublished oral deci-\nsion), 4 Election L. J. 418, 423 (2005).

According to the uncontested factual findings of the trial\ncourt, one of the candidates paid supporters to stand near polling places\nand encourage voters—especially those who were poor, infirm, or spoke\nlittle English—to vote absentee. The supporters asked the voters to\ncontact them when they received their ballots; the supporters then\n“assisted” the voter in filling out the ballot.\n                   Cite as: 553 U.

Even though Indiana’s own negli-\ngence may have contributed to the serious inflation of its\nregistration lists when SEA 483 was enacted, the fact of\ninflated voter rolls does provide a neutral and nondis-\ncriminatory reason supporting the State’s decision to\nrequire photo identification.\nSafeguarding Voter Confidence\n  Finally, the State contends that it has an interest in\nprotecting public confidence “in the integrity and legiti-\nmacy of representative government.” Brief for State Re-\nspondents, No. 07-25, p. 53.

Burdens of that sort arising from\nlife’s vagaries, however, are neither so serious nor so\nfrequent as to raise any question about the constitutional-\nity of SEA 483; the availability of the right to cast a provi-\nsional ballot provides an adequate remedy for problems of\nthat character.\n   The burdens that are relevant to the issue before us are\nthose imposed on persons who are eligible to vote but do\nnot possess a current photo identification that complies\nwith the requirements of SEA 483.16 The fact that most\nvoters already possess a valid driver’s license, or some\nother form of acceptable identification, would not save the\nstatute under our reasoning in Harper, if the State re-\n——————\n  15 For a survey of state practice, see Brief for Texas et al. as Amici\nCuriae 10–14, and nn. 1–23.\n  16 Ind.

But just as other States provide free voter\nregistration cards, the photo identification cards issued by\nIndiana’s BMV are also free. For most voters who need\nthem, the inconvenience of making a trip to the BMV,\ngathering the required documents, and posing for a photo-\ngraph surely does not qualify as a substantial burden on\nthe right to vote, or even represent a significant increase\nover the usual burdens of voting.17\n   Both evidence in the record and facts of which we may\ntake judicial notice, however, indicate that a somewhat\nheavier burden may be placed on a limited number of\npersons. They include elderly persons born out-of-state,\nwho may have difficulty obtaining a birth certificate;18\npersons who because of economic or other personal limita-\ntions may find it difficult either to secure a copy of their\nbirth certificate or to assemble the other required docu-\nmentation to obtain a state-issued identification; homeless\npersons; and persons with a religious objection to being\nphotographed. If we assume, as the evidence suggests,\n——————\n  17 To obtain a photo identification card a person must present at least\none “primary” document, which can be a birth certificate, certificate of\nnaturalization, U. S. veterans photo identification, U. S. military photo\nidentification, or a U. S. passport. Ind. Admin. Code, tit. 140, §7–4–3\n(2008). Indiana, like most States, charges a fee for obtaining a copy of\none’s birth certificate. This fee varies by county and is currently\nbetween $3 and $12.

To do so, however, they must travel to the circuit\ncourt clerk’s office within 10 days to execute the required\naffidavit. It is unlikely that such a requirement would\npose a constitutional problem unless it is wholly unjusti-\nfied. And even assuming that the burden may not be\njustified as to a few voters,19 that conclusion is by no\nmeans sufficient to establish petitioners’ right to the relief\nthey seek in this litigation.\n                            IV\n  Given the fact that petitioners have advanced a broad\nattack on the constitutionality of SEA 483, seeking relief\nthat would invalidate the statute in all its applications,\nthey bear a heavy burden of persuasion. Only a few weeks\nago we held that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit had failed to give appropriate weight to the magni-\ntude of that burden when it sustained a preelection, facial\nattack on a Washington statute regulating that State’s\nprimary election procedures. Washington State Grange v.\nWashington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\nOur reasoning in that case applies with added force to the\narguments advanced by petitioners in these cases.\n——————\n  19 Presumably   most voters casting provisional ballots will be able to\nobtain photo identifications before the next election. It is, however,\ndifficult to understand why the State should require voters with a faith-\nbased objection to being photographed to cast provisional ballots subject\nto later verification in every election when the BMV is able to issue\nthese citizens special licenses that enable them to drive without any\nphoto identification. See Ind. Code Ann. 9–24–11–5(c) (West Supp.\n2007).\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   Petitioners ask this Court, in effect, to perform a unique\nbalancing analysis that looks specifically at a small num-\nber of voters who may experience a special burden under\nthe statute and weighs their burdens against the State’s\nbroad interests in protecting election integrity. Petition-\ners urge us to ask whether the State’s interests justify the\nburden imposed on voters who cannot afford or obtain a\nbirth certificate and who must make a second trip to the\ncircuit court clerk’s office after voting. But on the basis of\nthe evidence in the record it is not possible to quantify\neither the magnitude of the burden on this narrow class of\nvoters or the portion of the burden imposed on them that\nis fully justified.\n   First, the evidence in the record does not provide us\nwith the number of registered voters without photo identi-\nfication; Judge Barker found petitioners’ expert’s report to\nbe “utterly incredible and unreliable.” 458 F. Supp. 2d, at\n803. Much of the argument about the numbers of such\nvoters comes from extrarecord, postjudgment studies, the\naccuracy of which has not been tested in the trial court.\n   Further, the deposition evidence presented in the Dis-\ntrict Court does not provide any concrete evidence of the\nburden imposed on voters who currently lack photo identi-\nfication. The record includes depositions of two case man-\nagers at a day shelter for homeless persons and the depo-\nsitions of members of the plaintiff organizations, none of\nwhom expressed a personal inability to vote under SEA\n483. A deposition from a named plaintiff describes the\ndifficulty the elderly woman had in obtaining an identifi-\ncation card, although her testimony indicated that she\nintended to return to the BMV since she had recently\nobtained her birth certificate and that she was able to pay\nthe birth certificate fee. App. 94.\n   Judge Barker’s opinion makes reference to six other\nelderly named plaintiffs who do not have photo identifica-\ntions, but several of these individuals have birth certifi-\n18       CRAWFORD v.

Supp. 2d, at 797–799. One elderly named plaintiff\nstated that she had attempted to obtain a birth certificate\nfrom Tennessee, but had not been successful, and another\ntestified that he did not know how to obtain a birth certifi-\ncate from North Carolina. The elderly in Indiana, how-\never, may have an easier time obtaining a photo identifi-\ncation card than the nonelderly, see n. 17, supra, and\nalthough it may not be a completely acceptable alterna-\ntive, the elderly in Indiana are able to vote absentee with-\nout presenting photo identification.\n   The record says virtually nothing about the difficulties\nfaced by either indigent voters or voters with religious\nobjections to being photographed. While one elderly man\nstated that he did not have the money to pay for a birth\ncertificate, when asked if he did not have the money or did\nnot wish to spend it, he replied, “both.” App. 211–212.\nFrom this limited evidence we do not know the magnitude\nof the impact SEA 483 will have on indigent voters in\nIndiana. The record does contain the affidavit of one\nhomeless woman who has a copy of her birth certificate,\nbut was denied a photo identification card because she did\nnot have an address. Id., at 67. But that single affidavit\ngives no indication of how common the problem is.\n   In sum, on the basis of the record that has been made in\nthis litigation, we cannot conclude that the statute im-\nposes “excessively burdensome requirements” on any class\nof voters. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 738 (1974).20\n——————\n   20 Three comments on JUSTICE SOUTER’s speculation about the non-\n\ntrivial burdens that SEA 483 may impose on “tens of thousands” of\nIndiana citizens, post, at 1 (dissenting opinion), are appropriate.

When we consider only the statute’s\nbroad application to all Indiana voters we conclude that it\n“imposes only a limited burden on voters’ rights.” Bur-\ndick, 504 U. S., at 439. The “ ‘precise interests’ ” advanced\nby the State are therefore sufficient to defeat petitioners’\nfacial challenge to SEA 483. Id., at 434.\n   Finally we note that petitioners have not demonstrated\nthat the proper remedy—even assuming an unjustified\nburden on some voters—would be to invalidate the entire\nstatute. When evaluating a neutral, nondiscriminatory\nregulation of voting procedure, “[w]e must keep in mind\nthat “ ‘[a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the in-\ntent of the elected representatives of the people.’ ” Ayotte\nv.

Further, nothing in the record\nestablishes the distribution of voters who lack photo identification. To\nthe extent that the evidence sheds any light on that issue, it suggests\nthat such voters reside primarily in metropolitan areas, which are\nserved by public transportation in Indiana (the majority of the plain-\ntiffs reside in Indianapolis and several of the organizational plaintiffs\nare Indianapolis organizations). Third, the indigent, elderly, or dis-\nabled need not “journey all the way to their county seat each time they\nwish to exercise the franchise,” post, at 29, if they obtain a free photo\nidentification card from the BMV. While it is true that obtaining a\nbirth certificate carries with it a financial cost, the record does not\nprovide even a rough estimate of how many indigent voters lack copies\nof their birth certificates. Supposition based on extensive Internet\nresearch is not an adequate substitute for admissible evidence subject\nto cross-examination in constitutional adjudication.\n20       CRAWFORD v.

Supp. 2d, at 783. It is fair to infer\nthat partisan considerations may have played a significant\nrole in the decision to enact SEA 483. If such considera-\ntions had provided the only justification for a photo identi-\nfication requirement, we may also assume that SEA 483\nwould suffer the same fate as the poll tax at issue in\nHarper.\n   But if a nondiscriminatory law is supported by valid\nneutral justifications, those justifications should not be\ndisregarded simply because partisan interests may have\nprovided one motivation for the votes of individual legisla-\ntors. The state interests identified as justifications for\nSEA 483 are both neutral and sufficiently strong to re-\nquire us to reject petitioners’ facial attack on the statute.\nThe application of the statute to the vast majority of Indi-\nana voters is amply justified by the valid interest in pro-\ntecting “the integrity and reliability of the electoral proc-\ness.” Anderson, 460 U.

That is true enough, but for the sake of\nclarity and finality (as well as adherence to precedent), I\nprefer to decide these cases on the grounds that petition-\ners’ premise is irrelevant and that the burden at issue is\nminimal and justified.\n   To evaluate a law respecting the right to vote—whether\nit governs voter qualifications, candidate selection, or the\nvoting process—we use the approach set out in Burdick v.\nTakushi, 504 U. S. 428 (1992). This calls for application of\na deferential “important regulatory interests” standard for\nnonsevere, nondiscriminatory restrictions, reserving strict\n2       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nscrutiny for laws that severely restrict the right to vote.\nId., at 433–434 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nlead opinion resists the import of Burdick by characteriz-\ning it as simply adopting “the balancing approach” of\nAnderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780 (1983) (majority\nopinion of STEVENS, J.). See ante, at 6; see also ante, at 6–\n7, n. 8. Although Burdick liberally quoted Anderson,\nBurdick forged Anderson’s amorphous “flexible standard”\ninto something resembling an administrable rule. See\nBurdick, supra, at 434. Since Burdick, we have repeatedly\nreaffirmed the primacy of its two-track approach. See\nTimmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351,\n358 (1997); Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S. 581, 586–587\n(2005). “[S]trict scrutiny is appropriate only if the burden\nis severe.” Id., at 592. Thus, the first step is to decide\nwhether a challenged law severely burdens the right to\nvote. Ordinary and widespread burdens, such as those\nrequiring “nominal effort” of everyone, are not severe. See\nid., at 591, 593–597. Burdens are severe if they go beyond\nthe merely inconvenient. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S.\n724, 728–729 (1974) (characterizing the law in Williams v.\nRhodes, 393 U. S. 23 (1968), as “severe” because it was “so\nburdensome” as to be “ ‘virtually impossible’ ” to satisfy).\n  Of course, we have to identify a burden before we can\nweigh it. The Indiana law affects different voters differ-\nently, ante, at 14–16, but what petitioners view as the\nlaw’s several light and heavy burdens are no more than\nthe different impacts of the single burden that the law\nuniformly imposes on all voters. To vote in person in\nIndiana, everyone must have and present a photo identifi-\ncation that can be obtained for free. The State draws no\nclassifications, let alone discriminatory ones, except to\nestablish optional absentee and provisional balloting for\ncertain poor, elderly, and institutionalized voters and for\nreligious objectors. Nor are voters who already have photo\nidentifications exempted from the burden, since those\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nvoters must maintain the accuracy of the information\ndisplayed on the identifications, renew them before they\nexpire, and replace them if they are lost.\n   The Indiana photo-identification law is a generally\napplicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation, and our\nprecedents refute the view that individual impacts are\nrelevant to determining the severity of the burden it im-\nposes. In the course of concluding that the Hawaii laws at\nissue in Burdick “impose[d] only a limited burden on\nvoters’ rights to make free choices and to associate politi-\ncally through the vote,” 504 U. S., at 439, we considered\nthe laws and their reasonably foreseeable effect on voters\ngenerally. See id., at 436–437. We did not discuss\nwhether the laws had a severe effect on Mr. Burdick’s own\nright to vote, given his particular circumstances. That\nwas essentially the approach of the Burdick dissenters,\nwho would have applied strict scrutiny to the laws because\nof their effect on “some voters.” See id., at 446 (KENNEDY,\nJ., dissenting); see also id., at 448 (“The majority’s analy-\nsis ignores the inevitable and significant burden a write-in\nban imposes upon some individual voters . . . .” (emphasis\nadded)). Subsequent cases have followed Burdick’s gener-\nalized review of nondiscriminatory election laws. See, e.g.,\nTimmons, supra, at 361–362; Clingman, supra, at 590–\n591, 592–593. Indeed, Clingman’s holding that burdens\nare not severe if they are ordinary and widespread would\nbe rendered meaningless if a single plaintiff could claim a\nsevere burden.\n   Not all of our decisions predating Burdick addressed\nwhether a challenged voting regulation severely burdened\nthe right to vote, but when we began to grapple with the\nmagnitude of burdens, we did so categorically and did not\nconsider the peculiar circumstances of individual voters or\ncandidates. See, e.g., Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431,\n438–441 (1971). Thus, in Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U. S.\n752 (1973), we did not link the State’s interest in inhibit-\n4        CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ning party raiding with the petitioners’ own circumstances.\nSee id., at 760–762. And in Storer v. Brown, supra, we\nobserved that the severity of the burden of a regulation\nshould be measured according to its “nature, extent, and\nlikely impact.” Id., at 738 (emphasis added). We therefore\ninstructed the District Court to decide on remand whether\n“a reasonably diligent independent candidate [could] be\nexpected to satisfy the signature requirements, or will it\nbe only rarely that the unaffiliated candidate will succeed\nin getting on the ballot?” Id., at 742 (emphasis added).\nNotably, we did not suggest that the District Court should\nconsider whether one of the petitioners would actually find\nit more difficult than a reasonably diligent candidate to\nobtain the required signatures. What mattered was the\ngeneral assessment of the burden.\n   Insofar as our election-regulation cases rest upon the\nrequirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Ander-\nson, supra, at 786, n. 7, weighing the burden of a nondis-\ncriminatory voting law upon each voter and concomitantly\nrequiring exceptions for vulnerable voters would effec-\ntively turn back decades of equal-protection jurisprudence.\nA voter complaining about such a law’s effect on him has\nno valid equal-protection claim because, without proof of\ndiscriminatory intent, a generally applicable law with\ndisparate impact is not unconstitutional. See, e.g., Wash-\nington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 248 (1976). The Fourteenth\nAmendment does not regard neutral laws as invidious\nones, even when their burdens purportedly fall dispropor-\ntionately on a protected class. A fortiori it does not do so\nwhen, as here, the classes complaining of disparate impact\nare not even protected.* See Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S.\n——————\n  * A number of our early right-to-vote decisions, purporting to rely\nupon the Equal Protection Clause, strictly scrutinized nondiscrimina-\ntory voting laws requiring the payment of fees. See, e.g., Harper v.\nVirginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663, 670 (1966) (poll tax); Bullock v.\nCarter, 405 U. S. 134, 145 (1972) (ballot-access fee); Lubin v.

S. 872, 878–879 (1990) (First Amendment\ndoes not require exceptions for religious objectors to neu-\ntral rules of general applicability).\n   Even if I thought that stare decisis did not foreclose\nadopting an individual-focused approach, I would reject it\nas an original matter. This is an area where the dos and\ndon’ts need to be known in advance of the election, and\nvoter-by-voter examination of the burdens of voting regu-\nlations would prove especially disruptive. A case-by-case\napproach naturally encourages constant litigation. Very\nfew new election regulations improve everyone’s lot, so the\npotential allegations of severe burden are endless. A State\nreducing the number of polling places would be open to the\ncomplaint it has violated the rights of disabled voters who\nlive near the closed stations. Indeed, it may even be the\ncase that some laws already on the books are especially\nburdensome for some voters, and one can predict lawsuits\ndemanding that a State adopt voting over the Internet or\nexpand absentee balloting.\n   That sort of detailed judicial supervision of the election\nprocess would flout the Constitution’s express commit-\nment of the task to the States. See Art. I, §4. It is for\nstate legislatures to weigh the costs and benefits of possi-\nble changes to their election codes, and their judgment\nmust prevail unless it imposes a severe and unjustified\noverall burden upon the right to vote, or is intended to\n——————\n415 U. S. 709, 716–719 (1974) (ballot-access fee). To the extent those\ndecisions continue to stand for a principle that Burdick v. Takushi, 504\nU. S. 428 (1992), does not already encompass, it suffices to note that we\nhave never held that legislatures must calibrate all election laws, even\nthose totally unrelated to money, for their impacts on poor voters or\nmust otherwise accommodate wealth disparities.\n6      CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndisadvantage a particular class. Judicial review of their\nhandiwork must apply an objective, uniform standard that\nwill enable them to determine, ex ante, whether the bur-\nden they impose is too severe.\n   The lead opinion’s record-based resolution of these\ncases, which neither rejects nor embraces the rule of our\nprecedents, provides no certainty, and will embolden\nlitigants who surmise that our precedents have been\nabandoned. There is no good reason to prefer that course.\n                        *     *    *\n  The universally applicable requirements of Indiana’s\nvoter-identification law are eminently reasonable. The\nburden of acquiring, possessing, and showing a free photo\nidentification is simply not severe, because it does not\n“even represent a significant increase over the usual bur-\ndens of voting.” Ante, at 15. And the State’s interests,\nante, at 7–13, are sufficient to sustain that minimal bur-\nden. That should end the matter. That the State accom-\nmodates some voters by permitting (not requiring) the\ncasting of absentee or provisional ballots, is an indul-\ngence—not a constitutional imperative that falls short of\nwhat is required.\n                      Cite as: 553 U.

See Reynolds,\nsupra, at 562 (“Especially since the right to exercise the\nfranchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative\nof other basic civil and political rights, any alleged in-\nfringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully\nand meticulously scrutinized”).\n   As against the unfettered right, however, lies the\n“[c]ommon sense, as well as constitutional law . . . that\ngovernment must play an active role in structuring elec-\ntions; ‘as a practical matter, there must be a substantial\nregulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest and\nif some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany\nthe democratic processes.’ ” Burdick, supra, at 433 (quot-\ning Storer v.

Voting by absentee ballot leaves an individual without the\npossibility of receiving assistance from poll workers, and thus increases\nthe likelihood of confusion and error. More seriously, as the Supreme\nCourt of Indiana has recognized, Indiana law “treats absentee voters\ndifferently from the way it treats Election Day voters,” in the important\nsense that “an absentee ballot may not be recounted in situations\nwhere clerical error by an election officer rendered it invalid.” Horse-\nman v.

It translates into an obvious\neconomic cost (whether in work time lost, or getting and\npaying for transportation) that an Indiana voter must bear\nto obtain an ID.\n   For those voters who can afford the roundtrip, a second\nfinancial hurdle appears: in order to get photo identifica-\ntion for the first time, they need to present “ ‘a birth cer-\ntificate, a certificate of naturalization, U. S. veterans\nphoto identification, U. S. military photo identification, or\na U. S. passport.’ ” Ante, at 14, n. 16 (lead opinion) (quot-\ning Ind. Admin. Code, tit. 140, §7–4–3 (2008)). As the lead\nopinion says, the two most common of these documents\ncome at a price: Indiana counties charge anywhere from\n$3 to $12 for a birth certificate (and in some other States\nthe fee is significantly higher), see ante, at 14, n. 16, and\n——————\nThe discrepancy appears to arise, in part, from the fact that the Ameri-\ncan Public Transportation Association has not counted demand re-\nsponse systems that have been established in at least 6 of these 13\ncounties.

S.\ncitizenship by birth. The total fees for a passport, more-\nover, are up to about $100.17 So most voters must pay at\nleast one fee to get the ID necessary to cast a regular\nballot.18 As with the travel costs, these fees are far from\nshocking on their face, but in the Burdick analysis it\nmatters that both the travel costs and the fees are dispro-\nportionately heavy for, and thus disproportionately likely\nto deter, the poor, the old, and the immobile.\n                              B\n   To be sure, Indiana has a provisional-ballot exception to\nthe ID requirement for individuals the State considers\n“indigent”19 as well as those with religious objections to\nbeing photographed, see ante, at 15 (lead opinion), and\nthis sort of exception could in theory provide a way around\nthe costs of procuring an ID. But Indiana’s chosen excep-\ntion does not amount to much relief.\n——————\n  17 See Department of State, How to Apply in Person for a Passport,\n\nhttp://travel.state.gov/passport/get/first/first_830.html; Department of\nState, Passport Fees (Feb. 1, 2008), http://travel.state.gov/passport/\nget/fees/fees_837.html (total fees of $100 for a passport book and $45 for\na passport card for individuals 16 and older).\n  18 The lead opinion notes that “the record does not provide even a\n\nrough estimate of how many indigent voters lack copies of their birth\ncertificates.” Ante, at 19, n. 20. But the record discloses no reason to\nthink that any appreciable number of poor voters would need birth\ncertificates absent the Voter ID Law, and no reason to believe that poor\npeople would spend money to get them if they did not need them.\n  19 To vote by provisional ballot, an individual must (at the circuit\n\ncourt clerk’s office) sign an affidavit affirming that she is “indigent” and\n“unable to obtain proof of identification without payment of a fee.” Ind.\nCode Ann. §3–11.7–5–2.5(c)(2)(A). Indiana law does not define the key\nterms “indigent” or “unable,” but I will assume for present purposes\nthat the Indiana Supreme Court will eventually construe these terms\nbroadly, so that the income threshold for indigency is at least at the\nfederal poverty level, and so that the exception covers even individuals\nwho are facing only short-term financial difficulties.\n                      Cite as: 553 U.

See 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 786 (citing Ind. Code Ann. §3–11–8–25.1\n(West Supp. 2007)). As the lead opinion recognizes,\nthough, ante, at 15, that is only the first step; to have the\nprovisional ballot counted, a voter must then appear in\nperson before the circuit court clerk or county election\nboard within 10 days of the election, to sign an affidavit\nattesting to indigency or religious objection to being pho-\ntographed (or to present an ID at that point),20 see 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 786. Unlike the trip to the BMV (which,\nassuming things go smoothly, needs to be made only once\nevery four years for renewal of nondriver photo identifica-\ntion, see id.), this one must be taken every time a poor\nperson or religious objector wishes to vote, because the\nState does not allow an affidavit to count in successive\nelections. And unlike the trip to the BMV (which at least\nhas a handful of license branches in the more populous\ncounties), a county has only one county seat. Forcing\nthese people to travel to the county seat every time they\ntry to vote is particularly onerous for the reason noted\nalready, that most counties in Indiana either lack public\ntransportation or offer only limited coverage. See supra,\nat 6–7.\n   That the need to travel to the county seat each election\namounts to a high hurdle is shown in the results of the\n2007 municipal elections in Marion County, to which\nIndiana’s Voter ID Law applied. Thirty-four provisional\nballots were cast, but only two provisional voters made it\n——————\n  20 Indiana law allows voters to cast a provisional ballot at the county\n\nclerk’s office starting 29 days prior to election day until noon of the day\nprior to election day, see Ind. Code Ann. §3–11.7–5–2.5, and this might\nenable some voters to make only one burdensome trip to the county\nseat. But for the voters who show up at the polls to vote and are there\ntold that they lack the photo identification needed to cast a regular\nballot, the Voter ID Law effectively forces them to make two trips.\n10       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                        SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nto the County Clerk’s Office within the 10 days. See Brief\nfor Respondents in No. 07–21, pp. 8–9. All 34 of these\naspiring voters appeared at the appropriate precinct; 33 of\nthem provided a signature, and every signature matched\nthe one on file; and 26 of the 32 voters whose ballots were\nnot counted had a history of voting in Marion County\nelections. See id., at 9.\n   All of this suggests that provisional ballots do not obvi-\nate the burdens of getting photo identification. And even\nif that were not so, the provisional-ballot option would be\ninadequate for a further reason: the indigency exception\nby definition offers no relief to those voters who do not\nconsider themselves (or would not be considered) indigent\nbut as a practical matter would find it hard, for nonfinan-\ncial reasons, to get the required ID (most obviously the\ndisabled).\n                             C\n  Indiana’s Voter ID Law thus threatens to impose serious\nburdens on the voting right, even if not “severe” ones, and\nthe next question under Burdick is whether the number of\nindividuals likely to be affected is significant as well.\nRecord evidence and facts open to judicial notice answer\nyes.\n  Although the District Court found that petitioners failed\nto offer any reliable empirical study of numbers of voters\naffected, see ante, at 17 (lead opinion),21 we may accept\nthat court’s rough calculation that 43,000 voting-age\nresidents lack the kind of identification card required by\nIndiana’s law.

S.\nCensus Bureau figures for Indiana’s voting-age population\nin 2004, see ibid., and the State does not argue that these\nraw data are unreliable.\n   The State, in fact, shows no discomfort with the District\nCourt’s finding that an “estimated 43,000 individuals”\n(about 1% of the State’s voting-age population) lack a\nqualifying ID. Brief for Respondents in No. 07–25, p. 25.\nIf the State’s willingness to take that number is surpris-\ning, it may be less so in light of the District Court’s obser-\nvation that “several factors . . . suggest the percentage of\nIndiana’s voting age population with photo identification\nis actually lower than 99%,” 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 807, n.\n43,22 a suggestion in line with national surveys showing\n——————\n  22 The  District Court explained:\n“[O]ur simple comparison of raw numbers does not take into account:\nindividuals who have died but whose Indiana driver’s license or identi-\nfication cards have not expired; individuals who have moved outside\nthe state and no longer consider themselves Indiana residents but who\nstill retain a valid Indiana license or identification card; individuals\nwho have moved into Indiana and now consider themselves Indiana\nresidents but have not yet obtained an Indiana license or identification;\nand individuals, such as students, who are residing in Indiana tempo-\nrarily, are registered to vote in another state, but have obtained an\nIndiana license or identification.” Id., at 807, n. 43.\n   The District Court also identified three factors that, in its view,\nmight require deductions of the 43,000 figure. First, the District Court\nnoted that BMV records do not cover all forms of identification that\nmay be used to vote under the Voter ID Law (e.g., federal photo identi-\nfication, such as a passport). This is a valid consideration, but is\nunlikely to overcome the additions that must be made for the various\nfactors listed above. Second, the court noted that the BMV records do\nnot account for the exceptions to the photo identification requirement\n(such as the indigency and absentee-ballot exceptions). This factor does\nnot warrant a deduction of the 43,000 number because, as I have\nargued, the indigency exception imposes serious burdens of its own, see\nsupra, at 8–10, and the absentee-ballot exception is not a wholly\nadequate substitute for voting in person, see n. 4, supra.

We have been offered\nno reason to think that Indiana does a substantially better\njob of distributing IDs than other States.23\n  So a fair reading of the data supports the District\nCourt’s finding that around 43,000 Indiana residents lack\nthe needed identification, and will bear the burdens the\nlaw imposes. To be sure, the 43,000 figure has to be dis-\ncounted to some extent, residents of certain nursing homes\nbeing exempted from the photo identification requirement.\n458 F. Supp. 2d, at 786.

A large\nproportion of them are likely to be in bad shape economi-\ncally, see 472 F. 3d 949, 951 (CA7 2007) (“No doubt most\npeople who don’t have photo ID are low on the economic\nladder”); cf. Bullock v. Carter, 405 U. S. 134, 144 (1972)\n(“[W]e would ignore reality were we not to recognize that\nthis system falls with unequal weight on voters . . . accord-\ning to their economic status”).25 The Voter ID Law places\nhurdles in the way of either getting an ID or of voting\nprovisionally, and they translate into nontrivial economic\ncosts. There is accordingly no reason to doubt that a sig-\nnificant number of state residents will be discouraged or\n——————\nestimate to exclude citizens who are not registered to vote, or who are\nregistered but not planning to vote. See Brief for Respondents in No.\n07–25, p. 25; see also ante, at 17 (lead opinion) (“[T]he evidence in the\nrecord does not provide us with the number of registered voters without\nphoto identification”). But that argument is flatly contradicted by this\nCourt’s settled precedent. As our cases have recognized, disfranchise-\nment is disfranchisement, whether or not the disfranchised voter would\nhave voted if given the choice. That is why in Dunn v. Blumstein, 405\nU. S. 330 (1972), the Court did not ask whether any significant number\nof individuals deprived of the right to vote by durational residence\nrequirements would actually have chosen to vote. And in Harper v.\nVirginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663 (1966), the Court did not pause\nto consider whether any of the qualified voters deterred by the $1.50\npoll tax would have opted to vote if there had been no fee. Our cases\nmake clear that the Constitution protects an individual’s ability to vote,\nnot merely his decision to do so.\n  25 Studies in other States suggest that the burdens of an ID require-\n\nment may also fall disproportionately upon racial minorities. See\nOverton, Voter Identification, 105 Mich. L. Rev. 631, 659 (2007) (“In\n1994, the U. S.

See ante, at 7–13. But\nhaving found the Voter ID Law burdens far from trivial, I\nhave to make a rigorous assessment of “ ‘the precise inter-\nests put forward by the State as justifications for the\nburden imposed by its rule,’ [and] ‘the extent to which\nthose interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s\nrights.’ ” Burdick, 504 U. S., at 434 (quoting Anderson,\n460 U. S., at 789).\n  As this quotation from Burdick indicates, the interests\nclaimed to justify the regulatory scheme are subject to\ndiscount in two distinct ways. First, the generalities\nraised by the State have to be shaved down to the precise\n“aspect[s of claimed interests] addressed by the law at\nissue.” California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S.\n567, 584 (2000) (emphasis omitted); see ibid. (scrutiny of\nstate interests “is not to be made in the abstract, by ask-\ning whether [the interests] are highly significant values;\nbut rather by asking whether the aspect of [those inter-\nests] addressed by the law at issue is highly significant”\n                    Cite as: 553 U.

And even if the State can show\nparticularized interests addressed by the law, those inter-\nests are subject to further discount depending on “the\nextent to which [they] make it necessary to burden the\nplaintiff’s rights.” Burdick, supra, at 434 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   As the lead opinion sees it, the State has offered four\nrelated concerns that suffice to justify the Voter ID Law:\nmodernizing election procedures, combating voter fraud,\naddressing the consequences of the State’s bloated voter\nrolls, and protecting public confidence in the integrity of\nthe electoral process. See ante, at 7–13. On closer look,\nhowever, it appears that the first two (which are really\njust one) can claim modest weight at best, and the latter\ntwo if anything weaken the State’s case.\n                              A\n  The lead opinion’s discussion of the State’s reasons\nbegins with the State’s asserted interests in “election\nmodernization,” ante, at 8–10, and in combating voter\nfraud, see ante, at 11–13. Although these are given sepa-\nrate headings, any line drawn between them is unconvinc-\ning; as I understand it, the “effort to modernize elections,”\nBrief for Respondents in No. 07–25, p. 12, is not for mod-\nernity’s sake, but to reach certain practical (or political)\nobjectives.27 In any event, if a proposed modernization\nwere in fact aimless, if it were put forward as change for\nchange’s sake, a State could not justify any appreciable\nburden on the right to vote that might ensue; useless\ntechnology has no constitutional value. And in fact that is\nnot the case here. The State says that it adopted the ID\nlaw principally to combat voter fraud, and it is this claim,\n——————\n  27 See generally R. Saltman, The History and Politics of Voting Tech-\nnology: In Quest of Integrity and Public Confidence (2006) (tracing the\nhistory of changes in methods of voting in the United States, and the\nsocial and political considerations behind them).\n18      CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nnot the slogan of “election modernization,” that warrants\nattention.\n                               1\n   There is no denying the abstract importance, the com-\npelling nature, of combating voter fraud. See Purcell, 549\nU. S., at 4 (acknowledging “the State’s compelling interest\nin preventing voter fraud”); cf. Eu v. San Francisco County\nDemocratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 231 (1989) (“A\nState indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving\nthe integrity of its election process”). But it takes several\nsteps to get beyond the level of abstraction here.\n   To begin with, requiring a voter to show photo identifi-\ncation before casting a regular ballot addresses only one\nform of voter fraud: in-person voter impersonation. The\nphoto ID requirement leaves untouched the problems of\nabsentee-ballot fraud, which (unlike in-person voter im-\npersonation) is a documented problem in Indiana, see 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 793; of registered voters voting more than\nonce (but maintaining their own identities) in different\ncounties or in different States; of felons and other disquali-\nfied individuals voting in their own names; of vote buying;\nor, for that matter, of ballot-stuffing, ballot miscounting,\nvoter intimidation, or any other type of corruption on the\npart of officials administering elections. See Brief for\nBrennan Center for Justice et al. as Amici Curiae 7.\n   And even the State’s interest in deterring a voter from\nshowing up at the polls and claiming to be someone he is\nnot must, in turn, be discounted for the fact that the State\nhas not come across a single instance of in-person voter\nimpersonation fraud in all of Indiana’s history. See 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 792–793; see also ante, at 11–13 (lead\nopinion). Neither the District Court nor the Indiana Gen-\neral Assembly that passed the Voter ID Law was given\nany evidence whatsoever of in-person voter impersonation\nfraud in the State. See 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 793. This\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

Ibid. It is also consistent with\nthe dearth of evidence of in-person voter impersonation in\nany other part of the country. See ante, at 11, n. 11 (lead\nopinion) (conceding that there are at most “scattered\ninstances of in-person voter fraud”); see also Brief for\nBrennan Center for Justice, supra, at 11–25, 25 (demon-\nstrating that “the national evidence—including the very\nevidence relied on by the courts below—suggests that the\ntype of voting fraud that may be remedied by a photo ID\nrequirement is virtually nonexistent: the ‘problem’ of voter\nimpersonation is not a real problem at all”).28\n   The State responds to the want of evidence with the\nassertion that in-person voter impersonation fraud is hard\nto detect. But this is like saying the “man who wasn’t\nthere” is hard to spot,29 and to know whether difficulty in\ndetection accounts for the lack of evidence one at least has\nto ask whether in-person voter impersonation is (or would\nbe) relatively harder to ferret out than other kinds of fraud\n(e.g., by absentee ballot) which the State has had no trou-\nble documenting. The answer seems to be no; there is\nreason to think that “impersonation of voters is . . . the\nmost likely type of fraud to be discovered.” U. S.

This is in part because an\nindividual who impersonates another at the polls commits\nhis fraud in the open, under the scrutiny of local poll\nworkers who may well recognize a fraudulent voter when\nthey hear who he claims to be. See Brief for Respondents\nin No. 07–21, p. 6 (“[P]recinct workers may recognize an\nimposter, and precinct election workers have the authority\nto challenge persons appearing to vote if the election board\nmember ‘is not satisfied that a person who offers to vote is\nthe person who the person represents the person to be’ ”\n(quoting Ind. Code Ann. §3–11–8–27 (West 2006))).\n  The relative ease of discovering in-person voter imper-\nsonation is also owing to the odds that any such fraud will\nbe committed by “organized groups such as campaigns or\npolitical parties” rather than by individuals acting alone.\nL. Minnite & D. Callahan, Securing the Vote: An Analysis\nof Election Fraud 14 (2003). It simply is not worth it for\nindividuals acting alone to commit in-person voter imper-\nsonation, which is relatively ineffectual for the foolish few\nwho may commit it. If an imposter gets caught, he is\nsubject to severe criminal penalties. See, e.g., Ind. Code\nAnn. §3–14–2–9 (making it a felony “knowingly [to] vot[e]\nor offe[r] to vote at an election when the person is not\nregistered or authorized to vote”); §3–14–2–11 (with cer-\ntain exceptions, “a person who knowingly votes or offers to\nvote in a precinct except the one in which the person is\nregistered and resides” commits a felony); §3–14–2–12(1)\n(making it a felony “knowingly [to] vot[e] or mak[e] appli-\ncation to vote in an election in a name other than the\nperson’s own”); §3–14–2–12(2) (a person who, “having\nvoted once at an election, knowingly applies to vote at the\nsame election in the person’s own name or any other\nname” commits a felony); see also 42 U.

And even\nif he succeeds, the imposter gains nothing more than one\nadditional vote for his candidate. See EAC Report 9 (in-\nperson voter impersonation “is an inefficient method of\ninfluencing an election”); J. Levitt, The Truth about Voter\nFraud 7 (2007) (“[F]raud by individual voters is a singu-\nlarly foolish and ineffective way to attempt to win an\nelection. Each act of voter fraud in connection with a\nfederal election risks five years in prison and a $10,000\nfine, in addition to any state penalties. In return, it yields\nat most one incremental vote. That single extra vote is\nsimply not worth the price” (footnote omitted)); cf. 472\nF. 3d, at 951 (“[A] vote in a political election rarely has\nany instrumental value, since elections for political office\nat the state or federal level are never decided by just one\nvote” (emphasis in original)).\n   In sum, fraud by individuals acting alone, however\ndifficult to detect, is unlikely. And while there may be\ngreater incentives for organized groups to engage in broad-\ngauged in-person voter impersonation fraud, see Minnite\n& Callahan, supra, at 20, it is also far more difficult to\nconceal larger enterprises of this sort. The State’s argu-\nment about the difficulty of detecting the fraud lacks real\nforce.\n                              2\n   Nothing else the State has to say does much to bolster\nits case. The State argues, for example, that even without\nevidence of in-person voter impersonation in Indiana, it is\nenough for the State to show that “opportunities [for such\nfraud] are transparently obvious in elections without\nidentification checks,” Brief for Respondents in No. 07–25,\np. 54. Of course they are, but Indiana elections before the\nVoter ID Law were not run “without identification checks”;\n22        CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                          SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\non the contrary, as the Marion County Election Board\ninforms us, “[t]ime-tested systems were in place to detect\nin-person voter impersonation fraud before the challenged\nstatute was enacted,” Brief for Respondents in No. 07–21,\np. 6. These included hiring poll workers who were pre-\ncinct residents familiar with the neighborhood, and mak-\ning signature comparisons, each effort being supported by\nthe criminal provisions mentioned before. Id., at 6–8.\n   For that matter, the deterrence argument can do only so\nmuch work, since photo identification is itself hardly a\nfailsafe against impersonation. Indiana knows this, and\nthat is why in 2007 the State began to issue redesigned\ndriver’s licenses with digital watermarking.30 The State\nhas made this shift precisely because, in the words of its\nBMV, “visual inspection is not adequate to determine the\nauthenticity” of driver’s licenses. See Indiana BMV, su-\npra, n. 30. Indeed, the BMV explains that the digital\nwatermarks (which can be scanned using equipment that,\nso far, Indiana does not use at polling places) is needed to\n“tak[e] the guesswork out of inspection.” Ibid.31 So, at\nleast until polling places have the machines and special\nsoftware to scan the new driver’s licenses, and until all the\nlicenses with the older designs expire (the licenses issued\nafter 2006 but before the 2007 redesigning are good until\n2012, see 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 791), Indiana’s law does no\nmore than assure that any in-person voter fraud will take\nplace with fake IDs, not attempted signature forgery.\n\n——————\n   30 See Indiana BMV, Digital Drivers License: Frequently Asked Ques-\n\ntions, “What is a digital watermark and why is Indiana incorporating it\ninto their driver license?”, http://www.in.gov/bmv/3382.htm.\n   31 In the words of Indiana’s Governor, Mitch Daniels: “ ‘Not very long\n\nago, Indiana driver’s licenses were a late-night talk show joke [because\nof] the ease of their fraudulent issuance and also their duplication . . . .\n[The new design] will make particularly their duplication dramatically\nmore difficult.’ ” Udell, Digital Driver’s Licenses Designed To Stem ID\nTheft, Evansville Courier, June 7, 2007, p.

See ante, at 12 (lead opinion).\nI reach this conclusion, like others accepted by the Court,\nbecause “ ‘[w]here a legislature has significantly greater\ninstitutional expertise, as, for example, in the field of\nelection regulation, the Court in practice defers to empiri-\ncal legislative judgments.’ ” Randall, 548 U. S., at 285\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting) (quoting Nixon v. Shrink Missouri\nGovernment PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 402 (2000) (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring)). Weight is owed to the legislative judgment\nas such. But the ultimate valuation of the particular\ninterest a State asserts has to take account of evidence\nagainst it as well as legislative judgments for it (certainly\nwhen the law is one of the most restrictive of its kind, see\nn. 26, supra), and on this record it would be unreasonable\nto accord this assumed state interest more than very\nmodest significance.32\n                             3\n  The antifraud rationale is open to skepticism on one\nfurther ground, what Burdick spoke of as an assessment of\nthe degree of necessity for the State’s particular course of\naction. Two points deserve attention, the first being that\n\n——————\n  32 On such flimsy evidence of fraud, it would also ignore the lessons of\n\nhistory to grant the State’s interest more than modest weight, as the\ninterest in combating voter fraud has too often served as a cover for\nunnecessarily restrictive electoral rules. See F. Ogden, The Poll Tax in\nthe South 9 (1958) (“In Arkansas and Texas, the argument was fre-\nquently presented that a poll tax payment prerequisite would purify\nelections by preventing repeaters and floaters from voting”); see also\nBrief for Historians and Other Scholars as Amici Curiae 4–15 (detailing\nabuses); R. Hayduk, Gatekeepers to the Franchise: Shaping Election\nAdministration in New York 36 (2005) (“In both historical and contem-\nporary contexts certain groups have had an interest in alleging fraud\nand thereby shaping electoral rules and practices in a restrictive\ndirection, and other groups have had an opposite interest”).\n24      CRAWFORD v.

A phase-in period would have\ngiven the State time to distribute its newly designed li-\ncenses, and to make a genuine effort to get them to indi-\nviduals in need, and a period for transition is exactly what\nthe Commission on Federal Election Reform, headed by\nformer President Carter and former Secretary of State\nBaker, recommended in its report. See Building Confi-\ndence in U. S. Elections §2.5 (Sept. 2005), App. 136, 140\n(hereinafter Carter-Baker Report) (“For the next two\nfederal elections, until January 1, 2010, in states that\nrequire voters to present ID at the polls, voters who fail to\ndo so should nonetheless be allowed to cast a provisional\nballot, and their ballot would count if their signature is\nverified”). During this phase-in period, the report said,\nStates would need to make “efforts to ensure that all\nvoters are provided convenient opportunities to obtain” the\nrequired identification. Id., at 141. The former President\nand former Secretary of State explained this recommenda-\ntion in an op-ed essay:\n        “Yes, we are concerned about the approximately 12\n     percent of citizens who lack a driver’s license. So we\n     proposed that states finally assume the responsibility\n     to seek out citizens to both register voters and provide\n     them with free ID’s that meet federal standards.\n     States should open new offices, use social service\n     agencies and deploy mobile offices to register voters.\n     By connecting ID’s to registration, voting participa-\n     tion will be expanded.” Carter & Baker, Voting Re-\n     form is in the Cards, N.

Individu-\nals unable to get photo identification are forced to travel to\nthe county seat every time they wish to exercise the fran-\nchise, and they have to get there within 10 days of the\nelection. See supra, at 8–10. Nothing about the State’s\ninterest in fighting voter fraud justifies this requirement\nof a post-election trip to the county seat instead of some\nverification process at the polling places.\n   In briefing this Court, the State responds by pointing to\nan interest in keeping lines at polling places short. See\nBrief for Respondents in No. 07–25, p. 58. It warns that\n“[i]f election workers—a scarce resource in any election—\nmust attend to the details of validating provisional ballots,\nvoters may have to wait longer to vote,” and it assures us\nthat “[n]othing deters voting so much as long lines at the\npolls.” Ibid. But this argument fails on its own terms, for\nwhatever might be the number of individuals casting a\nprovisional ballot, the State could simply allow voters to\nsign the indigency affidavit at the polls subject to review\nthere after the election.33 After all, the Voter ID Law\nalready requires voters lacking photo identification to\n——————\n  33 Florida has accommodated voters in this manner.      In Florida a\nvoter who casts a provisional ballot may have that vote counted if the\nvoter’s signature on the provisional-ballot certification matches the\nsignature on the voter’s registration. See Fla. Stat. Ann. §§101.043,\n101.048. The voter is not required to make a second trip to have her\nprovisional ballot counted.\n26      CRAWFORD v.

Supp. 2d, at 786.\n   Indeed, the State’s argument more than fails; it back-\nfires, in implicitly conceding that a not-insignificant num-\nber of individuals will need to rely on the burdensome\nprovisional-ballot mechanism. What is more, as the Dis-\ntrict Court found, the Voter ID Law itself actually in-\ncreases the likelihood of delay at the polls. Since any\nminor discrepancy between a voter’s photo identification\ncard and the registration information may lead to a chal-\nlenge, “the opportunities for presenting challenges ha[ve]\nincreased as a result of the photo identification require-\nments.” Id., at 789; cf. 472 F. 3d, at 955 (Evans, J., dis-\nsenting) (“The potential for mischief with this law is obvi-\nous. Does the name on the ID ‘conform’ to the name on\nthe voter registration list?

The two remain-\ning justifications, meanwhile, actually weaken the State’s\ncase.\n   The lead opinion agrees with the State that “the infla-\ntion of its voter rolls is further support for its enactment\nof” the Voter ID Law. Ante, at 12. This is a puzzling\nconclusion, given the fact, which the lead opinion notes,\nthat the National Government filed a complaint against\nIndiana, containing this allegation:\n     “Indiana has failed to conduct a general program that\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

S. C.\n§1973gg–6.\n   How any of this can justify restrictions on the right to\nvote is difficult to say. The State is simply trying to take\nadvantage of its own wrong: if it is true that the State’s\nfear of in-person voter impersonation fraud arises from its\nbloated voter checklist, the answer to the problem is in the\nState’s own hands. The claim that the State has an inter-\nest in addressing a symptom of the problem (alleged im-\npersonation) rather than the problem itself (the negli-\ngently maintained bloated rolls) is thus self-defeating; it\nshows that the State has no justifiable need to burden the\nright to vote as it does, and it suggests that the State is\nnot as serious about combating fraud as it claims to be.34\n   The State’s final justification, its interest in safeguard-\ning voter confidence, similarly collapses. The problem\nwith claiming this interest lies in its connection to the\nbloated voter rolls; the State has come up with nothing to\nsuggest that its citizens doubt the integrity of the State’s\n\n——————\n  34 The voting-rolls argument also suggests that it would not be so\n\ndifficult to detect in-person voter fraud after all. If it is true that\npractitioners of fraud are most likely to vote in the name of registered\nvoters whom they know to have died or left the jurisdiction, then\nIndiana could simply audit its voting records to examine whether, and\nhow often, in-person votes were cast using these invalid registrations.\n28      CRAWFORD v.

The answer to this problem is not to burden the\nright to vote, but to end the official negligence.\n   It should go without saying that none of this is to deny\nStates’ legitimate interest in safeguarding public confi-\ndence. The Court has, for example, recognized that fight-\ning perceptions of political corruption stemming from large\npolitical contributions is a legitimate and substantial state\ninterest, underlying not only campaign finance laws, but\nbribery and antigratuity statutes as well. See Nixon v.\nShrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 390\n(2000). But the force of the interest depends on the facts\n(or plausibility of the assumptions) said to justify invoking\nit. See id., at 391 (“The quantum of empirical evidence\nneeded to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative\njudgments will vary up or down with the novelty and\nplausibility of the justification raised”). While we found in\nNixon that “there is little reason to doubt that sometimes\nlarge contributions will work actual corruption of our\npolitical system, and no reason to question the existence of\na corresponding suspicion among voters,” id., at 395, there\nis plenty of reason to be doubtful here, both about the\nreality and the perception. It is simply not plausible to\nassume here, with no evidence of in-person voter imper-\nsonation fraud in a State, and very little of it nationwide,\nthat a public perception of such fraud is nevertheless\n“inherent” in an election system providing severe criminal\npenalties for fraud and mandating signature checks at the\npolls. Cf. id., at 390 (“[T]he perception of corruption [is]\n‘inherent in a regime of large individual financial contri-\nbutions’ to candidates for public office” (quoting Buckley v.\nValeo, 424 U. S. 1, 27 (1976) (per curiam)).\n                           C\n  Without a shred of evidence that in-person voter imper-\nsonation is a problem in the State, much less a crisis,\n                  Cite as: 553 U.

The State\nrecognizes that tens of thousands of qualified voters lack\nthe necessary federally issued or state-issued identifica-\ntion, but it insists on implementing the requirement im-\nmediately, without allowing a transition period for tar-\ngeted efforts to distribute the required identification to\nindividuals who need it. The State hardly even tries to\nexplain its decision to force indigents or religious objectors\nto travel all the way to their county seats every time they\nwish to vote, and if there is any waning of confidence in\nthe administration of elections it probably owes more to\nthe State’s violation of federal election law than to any\nimposters at the polling places. It is impossible to say, on\nthis record, that the State’s interest in adopting its sig-\nnally inhibiting photo identification requirement has been\nshown to outweigh the serious burdens it imposes on the\nright to vote.\n   If more were needed to condemn this law, our own\nprecedent would provide it, for the calculation revealed in\nthe Indiana statute crosses a line when it targets the poor\nand the weak. Cf. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780,\n793 (1983) (“[I]t is especially difficult for the State to\njustify a restriction that limits political participation by an\nidentifiable political group whose members share a par-\nticular viewpoint, associational preference, or economic\nstatus”). If the Court’s decision in Harper v. Virginia Bd.\nof Elections, 383 U. S. 663 (1966), stands for anything, it is\nthat being poor has nothing to do with being qualified to\nvote. Harper made clear that “[t]o introduce wealth or\npayment of a fee as a measure of a voter’s qualifications is\nto introduce a capricious or irrelevant factor.” Id., at 668.\nThe State’s requirements here, that people without cars\ntravel to a motor vehicle registry and that the poor who\nfail to do that get to their county seats within 10 days of\nevery election, likewise translate into unjustified economic\n30      CRAWFORD v.

Like that fee, the onus of the\nIndiana law is illegitimate just because it correlates with\nno state interest so well as it does with the object of deter-\nring poorer residents from exercising the franchise.\n                        *     *    *\n  The Indiana Voter ID Law is thus unconstitutional: the\nstate interests fail to justify the practical limitations\nplaced on the right to vote, and the law imposes an unrea-\nsonable and irrelevant burden on voters who are poor and\nold.

It imposes a burden upon\nsome voters, but it does so in order to prevent fraud, to\nbuild confidence in the voting system, and thereby to\nmaintain the integrity of the voting process. In determin-\ning whether this statute violates the Federal Constitution,\nI would balance the voting-related interests that the stat-\nute affects, asking “whether the statute burdens any one\nsuch interest in a manner out of proportion to the statute’s\nsalutary effects upon the others (perhaps, but not neces-\nsarily, because of the existence of a clearly superior, less\nrestrictive alternative).” Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Gov-\nernment PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 402 (2000) (BREYER, J., con-\ncurring); ante, at 6–7 (lead opinion) (similar standard);\nante, at 2–3 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (similar standard).\nApplying this standard, I believe the statute is unconstitu-\ntional because it imposes a disproportionate burden upon\n2       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthose eligible voters who lack a driver’s license or other\nstatutorily valid form of photo ID.\n  Like JUSTICE STEVENS, I give weight to the fact that a\nnational commission, chaired by former President Jimmy\nCarter and former Secretary of State James Baker, stud-\nied the issue and recommended that States should require\nvoter photo IDs. See Report of the Commission on Federal\nElection Reform, Building Confidence in U. S. Elections\n§2.5 (Sept. 2005) (Carter-Baker Report), App. 136–144.\nBecause the record does not discredit the Carter-Baker\nReport or suggest that Indiana is exceptional, I see noth-\ning to prevent Indiana’s Legislature (or a federal court\nconsidering the constitutionality of the statute) from\ntaking account of the legislatively relevant facts the report\nsets forth and paying attention to its expert conclusions.\nThus, I share the general view of the lead opinion insofar\nas it holds that the Constitution does not automatically\nforbid Indiana from enacting a photo ID requirement.\nWere I also to believe, as JUSTICE STEVENS believes, that\nthe burden imposed by the Indiana statute on eligible\nvoters who lack photo IDs is indeterminate “on the basis of\nthe record that has been made in this litigation,” ante, at\n18, or were I to believe, as JUSTICE SCALIA believes, that\nthe burden the statute imposes is “minimal” or “justified,”\nante, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment), then I too\nwould reject the petitioners’ facial attack, primarily for the\nreasons set forth in Part II of the lead opinion, see ante, at\n7–13.\n  I cannot agree, however, with JUSTICE STEVENS’ or\nJUSTICE SCALIA’s assessment of the burdens imposed by\nthe statute. The Carter-Baker Commission conditioned its\nrecommendation upon the States’ willingness to ensure\nthat the requisite photo IDs “be easily available and is-\nsued free of charge” and that the requirement be “phased\nin” over two federal election cycles, to ease the transition.\nCarter-Baker Report, at App. 139, 140. And as described\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nin Part II of JUSTICE SOUTER’s dissenting opinion, see\nante, at 3–16, Indiana’s law fails to satisfy these aspects of\nthe Commission’s recommendation.\n   For one thing, an Indiana nondriver, most likely to be\npoor, elderly, or disabled, will find it difficult and expen-\nsive to travel to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, particularly\nif he or she resides in one of the many Indiana counties\nlacking a public transportation system. See ante, at 6–7\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting) (noting that out of Indiana’s 92\ncounties, 21 have no public transportation system at all\nand 32 others restrict public transportation to regional\ncounty service). For another, many of these individuals\nmay be uncertain about how to obtain the underlying\ndocumentation, usually a passport or a birth certificate,\nupon which the statute insists. And some may find the\ncosts associated with these documents unduly burdensome\n(up to $12 for a copy of a birth certificate; up to $100 for a\npassport). By way of comparison, this Court previously\nfound unconstitutionally burdensome a poll tax of $1.50\n(less than $10 today, inflation-adjusted). See Harper v.\nVirginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663, 664 n. 1, 666\n(1966); ante, at 30 (SOUTER, J., dissenting). Further,\nIndiana’s exception for voters who cannot afford this cost\nimposes its own burden: a postelection trip to the county\nclerk or county election board to sign an indigency affida-\nvit after each election. See ante, at 8–10 (same).\n   By way of contrast, two other States—Florida and Geor-\ngia—have put into practice photo ID requirements signifi-\ncantly less restrictive than Indiana’s. Under the Florida\nlaw, the range of permissible forms of photo ID is substan-\ntially greater than in Indiana. See Fla. Stat. §101.043(1)\n(West Supp. 2008) (including employee badge or ID, a\ndebit or credit card, a student ID, a retirement center ID,\na neighborhood association ID, and a public assistance\nID). Moreover, a Florida voter who lacks photo ID may\ncast a provisional ballot at the polling place that will be\n4       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncounted if the State determines that his signature\nmatches the one on his voter registration form.\n§§101.043(2); 101.048(2)(b).\n  Georgia restricts voters to a more limited list of accept-\nable photo IDs than does Florida, but accepts in addition\nto proof of voter registration a broader range of underlying\ndocumentation than does Indiana. See Ga. Code Ann.\n§21–2–417 (Supp. 2007); Ga. Comp. Rules & Regs., Rule\n183–1–20.01 (2008) (permissible underlying documents\ninclude a paycheck stub, Social Security, Medicare, or\nMedicaid statement, school transcript, or federal affidavit\nof birth, as long as the document includes the voter’s full\nname and date of birth). Moreover, a Federal District\nCourt found that Georgia “has undertaken a serious,\nconcerted effort to notify voters who may lack Photo ID\ncards of the Photo ID requirement, to inform those voters\nof the availability of free [State-issued] Photo ID cards or\nfree Voter ID cards, to instruct the voters concerning how\nto obtain the cards, and to advise the voters that they can\nvote absentee by mail without a Photo ID.” Common\nCause/Georgia v.

While Indiana allows only certain groups such\nas the elderly and disabled to vote by absentee ballot, in\nGeorgia any voter may vote absentee without providing\nany excuse, and (except where required by federal law)\nneed not present a photo ID in order to do so. Compare\nInd. Code §3–11–4–1 (West 2006) with Ga. Code Ann.\n§21–2–381 (Supp. 2007). Finally, neither Georgia nor\nFlorida insists, as Indiana does, that indigent voters travel\neach election cycle to potentially distant places for the\npurposes of signing an indigency affidavit.\n  The record nowhere provides a convincing reason why\nIndiana’s photo ID requirement must impose greater\nburdens than those of other States, or than the Carter-\nBaker Commission recommended nationwide.

And I need not\ndetermine the constitutionality of Florida’s or Georgia’s\nrequirements (matters not before us), in order to conclude\nthat Indiana’s requirement imposes a significantly\nharsher, unjustified burden.\n   Of course, the Carter-Baker Report is not the Constitu-\ntion of the United States. But its findings are highly\nrelevant to both legislative and judicial determinations of\nthe reasonableness of a photo ID requirement; to the\nrelated necessity of assuring that all those eligible to vote\npossess the requisite IDs; and to the presence of alterna-\ntive methods of assuring that possession, methods that are\nsuperior to those that Indiana’s statute sets forth. The\nCommission’s findings, taken together with the considera-\ntions set forth in Part II of JUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion, and\nPart II of JUSTICE SOUTER’s dissenting opinion, lead me to\nthe conclusion that while the Constitution does not in\ngeneral forbid Indiana from enacting a photo ID require-\nment, this statute imposes a disproportionate burden upon\nthose without valid photo IDs.

In affirming, the\n  Seventh Circuit declined to judge the law by the strict standard set\n  for poll taxes in Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U.

Pp. 5–20.\n    (a) Under Harper, even rational restrictions on the right to vote are\n  invidious if they are unrelated to voter qualifications. However,\n  “even handed restrictions” protecting the “integrity and reliability of\n  the electoral process itself” satisfy Harper’s standard. Anderson v.\n  Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788, n. 9. A state law’s burden on a politi-\n  cal party, an individual voter, or a discrete class of voters must be\n  justified by relevant and legitimate state interests “sufficiently\n  weighty to justify the limitation.” Norman v.

MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    288–289. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) Each of Indiana’s asserted interests is unquestionably relevant\n    to its interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the elec-\n    toral process. The first is the interest in deterring and detecting\n    voter fraud. Indiana has a valid interest in participating in a na-\n    tionwide effort to improve and modernize election procedures criti-\n    cized as antiquated and inefficient. Indiana also claims a particular\n    interest in preventing voter fraud in response to the problem of voter\n    registration rolls with a large number of names of persons who are\n    either deceased or no longer live in Indiana. While the record con-\n    tains no evidence that the fraud SEA 483 addresses—in-person voter\n    impersonation at polling places—has actually occurred in Indiana,\n    such fraud has occurred in other parts of the country, and Indiana’s\n    own experience with voter fraud in a 2003 mayoral primary demon-\n    strates a real risk that voter fraud could affect a close election’s out-\n    come. There is no question about the legitimacy or importance of a\n    State’s interest in counting only eligible voters’ votes. Finally, Indi-\n    ana’s interest in protecting public confidence in elections, while\n    closely related to its interest in preventing voter fraud, has inde-\n    pendent significance, because such confidence encourages citizen par-\n    ticipation in the democratic process. Pp. 7–13.\n       (c) The relevant burdens here are those imposed on eligible voters\n    who lack photo identification cards that comply with SEA 483. Be-\n    cause Indiana’s cards are free, the inconvenience of going to the Bu-\n    reau of Motor Vehicles, gathering required documents, and posing for\n    a photograph does not qualify as a substantial burden on most voters’\n    right to vote, or represent a significant increase over the usual bur-\n    dens of voting. The severity of the somewhat heavier burden that\n    may be placed on a limited number of persons—e.g., elderly persons\n    born out-of-state, who may have difficulty obtaining a birth certifi-\n    cate—is mitigated by the fact that eligible voters without photo iden-\n    tification may cast provisional ballots that will be counted if they\n    execute the required affidavit at the circuit court clerk’s office. Even\n    assuming that the burden may not be justified as to a few voters, that\n    conclusion is by no means sufficient to establish petitioners’ right to\n    the relief they seek. Pp. 13–16.\n       (d) Petitioners bear a heavy burden of persuasion in seeking to in-\n    validate SEA 483 in all its applications. This Court’s reasoning in\n    Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552\n    U. S. ___, applies with added force here. Petitioners argue that Indi-\n    ana’s interests do not justify the burden imposed on voters who can-\n    not afford or obtain a birth certificate and who must make a second\n    trip to the circuit court clerk’s office, but it is not possible to quantify,\n    based on the evidence in the record, either that burden’s magnitude\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  or the portion of the burden that is fully justified. A facial challenge\n  must fail where the statute has a “ ‘plainly legitimate sweep.’ ” Id., at\n  ___. When considering SEA 483’s broad application to all Indiana\n  voters, it “imposes only a limited burden on voters’ rights.” Burdick\n  v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 439. The “precise interests” advanced by\n  Indiana are therefore sufficient to defeat petitioners’ facial challenge.\n  Id., at 434. Pp. 16–20.\n     (e) Valid neutral justifications for a nondiscriminatory law, such as\n  SEA 483, should not be disregarded simply because partisan inter-\n  ests may have provided one motivation for the votes of individual leg-\n  islators. P. 20.\n     JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE ALITO, was\n  of the view that petitioners’ premise that the voter-identification law\n  might have imposed a special burden on some voters is irrelevant.\n  The law should be upheld because its overall burden is minimal and\n  justified. A law respecting the right to vote should be evaluated un-\n  der the approach in Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, which calls for\n  application of a deferential, “important regulatory interests” stan-\n  dard for nonsevere, nondiscriminatory restrictions, reserving strict\n  scrutiny for laws that severely restrict the right to vote, id., at 433–\n  434. The different ways in which Indiana’s law affects different vot-\n  ers are no more than different impacts of the single burden that the\n  law uniformly imposes on all voters: To vote in person, everyone must\n  have and present a photo identification that can be obtained for free.\n  This is a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation.\n  The law’s universally applicable requirements are eminently reason-\n  able because the burden of acquiring, possessing, and showing a free\n  photo identification is not a significant increase over the usual voting\n  burdens, and the State’s stated interests are sufficient to sustain that\n  minimal burden.

The majority first held that the\nDemocrats had standing to bring a facial challenge to the\nconstitutionality of SEA 483. Next, noting the absence of\nany plaintiffs who claimed that the law would deter them\nfrom voting, the Court of Appeals inferred that “the moti-\nvation for the suit is simply that the law may require the\nDemocratic Party and the other organizational plaintiffs\nto work harder to get every last one of their supporters to\nthe polls.” Id., at 952. It rejected the argument that the\nlaw should be judged by the same strict standard applica-\nble to a poll tax because the burden on voters was offset by\nthe benefit of reducing the risk of fraud. The dissenting\njudge, viewing the justification for the law as “hollow”—\nmore precisely as “a not-too-thinly-veiled attempt to dis-\ncourage election-day turnout by certain folks believed to\nskew Democratic”—would have applied a stricter stan-\ndard, something he described as “close to ‘strict scrutiny\nlight.’ ” Id., at 954, 956 (opinion of Evans, J.).

Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663\n(1966), the Court held that Virginia could not condition\nthe right to vote in a state election on the payment of a\npoll tax of $1.50. We rejected the dissenters’ argument\nthat the interest in promoting civic responsibility by weed-\ning out those voters who did not care enough about public\naffairs to pay a small sum for the privilege of voting pro-\nvided a rational basis for the tax. See id., at 685 (opinion\nof Harlan, J.). Applying a stricter standard, we concluded\nthat a State “violates the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment whenever it makes the affluence\nof the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard.”\nId., at 666 (opinion of the Court). We used the term “in-\nvidiously discriminate” to describe conduct prohibited\nunder that standard, noting that we had previously held\nthat while a State may obviously impose “reasonable\nresidence restrictions on the availability of the ballot,” it\n“may not deny the opportunity to vote to a bona fide resi-\ndent merely because he is a member of the armed ser-\nvices.” Id., at 666–667 (citing Carrington v. Rash, 380\nU. S. 89, 96 (1965)). Although the State’s justification for\nthe tax was rational, it was invidious because it was ir-\nrelevant to the voter’s qualifications.\n   Thus, under the standard applied in Harper, even ra-\ntional restrictions on the right to vote are invidious if they\n——————\n  7 We also agree with the unanimous view of those judges that the\nDemocrats have standing to challenge the validity of SEA 483 and that\nthere is no need to decide whether the other petitioners also have\nstanding.\n6        CRAWFORD v.

S., at 788, n. 9. Rather than applying any\n“litmus test” that would neatly separate valid from invalid\nrestrictions, we concluded that a court must identify and\nevaluate the interests put forward by the State as justifi-\ncations for the burden imposed by its rule, and then make\nthe “hard judgment” that our adversary system demands.\n   In later election cases we have followed Anderson’s\nbalancing approach. Thus, in Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S.\n279, 288–289 (1992), after identifying the burden Illinois\nimposed on a political party’s access to the ballot, we\n“called for the demonstration of a corresponding interest\nsufficiently weighty to justify the limitation,” and con-\ncluded that the “severe restriction” was not justified by a\nnarrowly drawn state interest of compelling importance.\nLater, in Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428 (1992), we\napplied Anderson’s standard for “ ‘reasonable, nondis-\ncriminatory restrictions,’ ” 504 U. S., at 434, and upheld\nHawaii’s prohibition on write-in voting despite the fact\nthat it prevented a significant number of “voters from\nparticipating in Hawaii elections in a meaningful man-\nner.” Id., at 443 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). We reaffirmed\nAnderson’s requirement that a court evaluating a constitu-\ntional challenge to an election regulation weigh the as-\nserted injury to the right to vote against the “ ‘precise\ninterests put forward by the State as justifications for the\nburden imposed by its rule.’ ” 504 U. S., at 434 (quoting\nAnderson, 460 U. S., at 789).8\n——————\n  8 Contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion, see post, at 2 (opinion\n\nconcurring in judgment), our approach remains faithful to Anderson\nand Burdick.

However slight that burden\nmay appear, as Harper demonstrates, it must be justified\nby relevant and legitimate state interests “sufficiently\nweighty to justify the limitation.” Norman, 502 U. S.,\nat 288–289. We therefore begin our analysis of the con-\nstitutionality of Indiana’s statute by focusing on those\ninterests.\n                               II\n   The State has identified several state interests that\narguably justify the burdens that SEA 483 imposes on\nvoters and potential voters. While petitioners argue that\nthe statute was actually motivated by partisan concerns\nand dispute both the significance of the State’s interests\nand the magnitude of any real threat to those interests,\nthey do not question the legitimacy of the interests the\nState has identified. Each is unquestionably relevant to\nthe State’s interest in protecting the integrity and reliabil-\nity of the electoral process.\n   The first is the interest in deterring and detecting voter\nfraud. The State has a valid interest in participating in a\nnationwide effort to improve and modernize election pro-\ncedures that have been criticized as antiquated and ineffi-\ncient.9 The State also argues that it has a particular\n——————\nadherence to Anderson, see 504 U. S., at 434, and repeatedly cited\nAnderson, see 504 U. S., at 436, n. 5, 440, n. 9, 441. To be sure, Burdick\nrejected the argument that strict scrutiny applies to all laws imposing a\nburden on the right to vote; but in its place, the Court applied the\n“ ‘flexible standard’ ” set forth in Anderson. Burdick surely did not\ncreate a novel “deferential ‘important regulatory interests’ standard.”\nSee post, at 1–2.\n    9 See National Commission on Federal Election Reform, To Assure\n\nPride and Confidence in the Electoral Process 18 (2002) (with Honorary\nCo-chairs former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter).\n8       CRAWFORD v.

Finally, the State relies on its\ninterest in safeguarding voter confidence. Each of these\ninterests merits separate comment.\nElection Modernization\n   Two recently enacted federal statutes have made it\nnecessary for States to reexamine their election proce-\ndures. Both contain provisions consistent with a State’s\nchoice to use government-issued photo identification as a\nrelevant source of information concerning a citizen’s eligi-\nbility to vote.\n   In the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA),\n107 Stat. 77, 42 U. S. C. §1973gg et seq., Congress estab-\nlished procedures that would both increase the number of\nregistered voters and protect the integrity of the electoral\nprocess. §1973gg. The statute requires state motor vehi-\ncle driver’s license applications to serve as voter registra-\ntion applications. §1973gg–3. While that requirement has\nincreased the number of registered voters, the statute also\ncontains a provision restricting States’ ability to remove\nnames from the lists of registered voters. §1973gg–6(a)(3).\nThese protections have been partly responsible for inflated\nlists of registered voters. For example, evidence credited\nby Judge Barker estimated that as of 2004 Indiana’s voter\nrolls were inflated by as much as 41.4%, see 458 F. Supp.\n2d, at 793, and data collected by the Election Assistance\nCommittee in 2004 indicated that 19 of 92 Indiana coun-\nties had registration totals exceeding 100% of the 2004\nvoting-age population, Dept. of Justice Complaint in\nUnited States v.

HAVA\nalso requires the States to verify voter information con-\ntained in a voter registration application and specifies\neither an “applicant’s driver’s license number” or “the last\n4 digits of the applicant’s social security number” as\nacceptable verifications. §15483(a)(5)(A)(i). If an indi-\nvidual has neither number, the State is required to\nassign the applicant a voter identification number.\n§15483(a)(5)(A)(ii).\n   HAVA also imposes new identification requirements for\nindividuals registering to vote for the first time who sub-\nmit their applications by mail. If the voter is casting his\nballot in person, he must present local election officials\nwith written identification, which may be either “a current\nand valid photo identification” or another form of docu-\nmentation such as a bank statement or paycheck.\n§15483(b)(2)(A). If the voter is voting by mail, he must\ninclude a copy of the identification with his ballot. A voter\nmay also include a copy of the documentation with his\napplication or provide his driver’s license number or Social\nSecurity number for verification. §15483(b)(3). Finally, in\na provision entitled “Fail-safe voting,” HAVA authorizes\nthe casting of provisional ballots by challenged voters.\n§15483(b)(2)(B).\n   Of course, neither HAVA nor NVRA required Indiana to\nenact SEA 483, but they do indicate that Congress be-\nlieves that photo identification is one effective method of\nestablishing a voter’s qualification to vote and that the\nintegrity of elections is enhanced through improved tech-\nnology. That conclusion is also supported by a report\nissued shortly after the enactment of SEA 483 by the\nCommission on Federal Election Reform chaired by former\nPresident Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State\nJames A. Baker III, which is a part of the record in these\ncases. In the introduction to their discussion of voter\n10       CRAWFORD v.

In the old days and in small towns where\n     everyone knows each other, voters did not need to\n     identify themselves. But in the United States, where\n     40 million people move each year, and in urban areas\n     where some people do not even know the people living\n     in their own apartment building let alone their pre-\n     cinct, some form of identification is needed.\n        “There is no evidence of extensive fraud in U.

Burdens of that sort arising from\nlife’s vagaries, however, are neither so serious nor so\nfrequent as to raise any question about the constitutional-\nity of SEA 483; the availability of the right to cast a provi-\nsional ballot provides an adequate remedy for problems of\nthat character.\n   The burdens that are relevant to the issue before us are\nthose imposed on persons who are eligible to vote but do\nnot possess a current photo identification that complies\nwith the requirements of SEA 483.16 The fact that most\nvoters already possess a valid driver’s license, or some\nother form of acceptable identification, would not save the\nstatute under our reasoning in Harper, if the State re-\n——————\n  15 For a survey of state practice, see Brief for Texas et al. as Amici\nCuriae 10–14, and nn. 1–23.\n  16 Ind.

But just as other States provide free voter\nregistration cards, the photo identification cards issued by\nIndiana’s BMV are also free. For most voters who need\nthem, the inconvenience of making a trip to the BMV,\ngathering the required documents, and posing for a photo-\ngraph surely does not qualify as a substantial burden on\nthe right to vote, or even represent a significant increase\nover the usual burdens of voting.17\n   Both evidence in the record and facts of which we may\ntake judicial notice, however, indicate that a somewhat\nheavier burden may be placed on a limited number of\npersons. They include elderly persons born out-of-state,\nwho may have difficulty obtaining a birth certificate;18\npersons who because of economic or other personal limita-\ntions may find it difficult either to secure a copy of their\nbirth certificate or to assemble the other required docu-\nmentation to obtain a state-issued identification; homeless\npersons; and persons with a religious objection to being\nphotographed. If we assume, as the evidence suggests,\n——————\n  17 To obtain a photo identification card a person must present at least\none “primary” document, which can be a birth certificate, certificate of\nnaturalization, U. S. veterans photo identification, U. S. military photo\nidentification, or a U. S. passport. Ind. Admin. Code, tit. 140, §7–4–3\n(2008). Indiana, like most States, charges a fee for obtaining a copy of\none’s birth certificate. This fee varies by county and is currently\nbetween $3 and $12. See Indiana State Department of Health Web\npage, http://www.in.gov/isdh/bdcertifs/lhdfees/toc.htm.     Some States\ncharge substantially more.

To do so, however, they must travel to the circuit\ncourt clerk’s office within 10 days to execute the required\naffidavit. It is unlikely that such a requirement would\npose a constitutional problem unless it is wholly unjusti-\nfied. And even assuming that the burden may not be\njustified as to a few voters,19 that conclusion is by no\nmeans sufficient to establish petitioners’ right to the relief\nthey seek in this litigation.\n                            IV\n  Given the fact that petitioners have advanced a broad\nattack on the constitutionality of SEA 483, seeking relief\nthat would invalidate the statute in all its applications,\nthey bear a heavy burden of persuasion. Only a few weeks\nago we held that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit had failed to give appropriate weight to the magni-\ntude of that burden when it sustained a preelection, facial\nattack on a Washington statute regulating that State’s\nprimary election procedures. Washington State Grange v.\nWashington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\nOur reasoning in that case applies with added force to the\narguments advanced by petitioners in these cases.\n——————\n  19 Presumably   most voters casting provisional ballots will be able to\nobtain photo identifications before the next election. It is, however,\ndifficult to understand why the State should require voters with a faith-\nbased objection to being photographed to cast provisional ballots subject\nto later verification in every election when the BMV is able to issue\nthese citizens special licenses that enable them to drive without any\nphoto identification. See Ind. Code Ann. 9–24–11–5(c) (West Supp.\n2007).\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   Petitioners ask this Court, in effect, to perform a unique\nbalancing analysis that looks specifically at a small num-\nber of voters who may experience a special burden under\nthe statute and weighs their burdens against the State’s\nbroad interests in protecting election integrity. Petition-\ners urge us to ask whether the State’s interests justify the\nburden imposed on voters who cannot afford or obtain a\nbirth certificate and who must make a second trip to the\ncircuit court clerk’s office after voting. But on the basis of\nthe evidence in the record it is not possible to quantify\neither the magnitude of the burden on this narrow class of\nvoters or the portion of the burden imposed on them that\nis fully justified.\n   First, the evidence in the record does not provide us\nwith the number of registered voters without photo identi-\nfication; Judge Barker found petitioners’ expert’s report to\nbe “utterly incredible and unreliable.” 458 F. Supp. 2d, at\n803. Much of the argument about the numbers of such\nvoters comes from extrarecord, postjudgment studies, the\naccuracy of which has not been tested in the trial court.\n   Further, the deposition evidence presented in the Dis-\ntrict Court does not provide any concrete evidence of the\nburden imposed on voters who currently lack photo identi-\nfication. The record includes depositions of two case man-\nagers at a day shelter for homeless persons and the depo-\nsitions of members of the plaintiff organizations, none of\nwhom expressed a personal inability to vote under SEA\n483. A deposition from a named plaintiff describes the\ndifficulty the elderly woman had in obtaining an identifi-\ncation card, although her testimony indicated that she\nintended to return to the BMV since she had recently\nobtained her birth certificate and that she was able to pay\nthe birth certificate fee. App. 94.\n   Judge Barker’s opinion makes reference to six other\nelderly named plaintiffs who do not have photo identifica-\ntions, but several of these individuals have birth certifi-\n18       CRAWFORD v.

Supp. 2d, at 797–799. One elderly named plaintiff\nstated that she had attempted to obtain a birth certificate\nfrom Tennessee, but had not been successful, and another\ntestified that he did not know how to obtain a birth certifi-\ncate from North Carolina. The elderly in Indiana, how-\never, may have an easier time obtaining a photo identifi-\ncation card than the nonelderly, see n. 17, supra, and\nalthough it may not be a completely acceptable alterna-\ntive, the elderly in Indiana are able to vote absentee with-\nout presenting photo identification.\n   The record says virtually nothing about the difficulties\nfaced by either indigent voters or voters with religious\nobjections to being photographed. While one elderly man\nstated that he did not have the money to pay for a birth\ncertificate, when asked if he did not have the money or did\nnot wish to spend it, he replied, “both.” App. 211–212.\nFrom this limited evidence we do not know the magnitude\nof the impact SEA 483 will have on indigent voters in\nIndiana. The record does contain the affidavit of one\nhomeless woman who has a copy of her birth certificate,\nbut was denied a photo identification card because she did\nnot have an address. Id., at 67. But that single affidavit\ngives no indication of how common the problem is.\n   In sum, on the basis of the record that has been made in\nthis litigation, we cannot conclude that the statute im-\nposes “excessively burdensome requirements” on any class\nof voters. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 738 (1974).20\n——————\n   20 Three comments on JUSTICE SOUTER’s speculation about the non-\n\ntrivial burdens that SEA 483 may impose on “tens of thousands” of\nIndiana citizens, post, at 1 (dissenting opinion), are appropriate. First,\nthe fact that the District Judge estimated that when the statute was\npassed in 2005, 43,000 citizens did not have photo identification, see\n458 F. Supp. 2d 775, 807 (SD Ind. 2006), tells us nothing about the\nnumber of free photo identification cards issued since then. Second, the\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

S., at ___ (quoting Washington v. Glucksberg, 521\nU. S. 702, 739–740, and n. 7 (1997) (STEVENS, J., concur-\nring in judgments)). When we consider only the statute’s\nbroad application to all Indiana voters we conclude that it\n“imposes only a limited burden on voters’ rights.” Bur-\ndick, 504 U. S., at 439. The “ ‘precise interests’ ” advanced\nby the State are therefore sufficient to defeat petitioners’\nfacial challenge to SEA 483. Id., at 434.\n   Finally we note that petitioners have not demonstrated\nthat the proper remedy—even assuming an unjustified\nburden on some voters—would be to invalidate the entire\nstatute. When evaluating a neutral, nondiscriminatory\nregulation of voting procedure, “[w]e must keep in mind\nthat “ ‘[a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the in-\ntent of the elected representatives of the people.’ ” Ayotte\nv. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S.\n\n——————\nfact that public transportation is not available in some Indiana counties\ntells us nothing about how often elderly and indigent citizens have an\nopportunity to obtain a photo identification at the BMV, either during a\nroutine outing with family or friends or during a special visit to the\nBMV arranged by a civic or political group such as the League of\nWomen Voters or a political party. Further, nothing in the record\nestablishes the distribution of voters who lack photo identification. To\nthe extent that the evidence sheds any light on that issue, it suggests\nthat such voters reside primarily in metropolitan areas, which are\nserved by public transportation in Indiana (the majority of the plain-\ntiffs reside in Indianapolis and several of the organizational plaintiffs\nare Indianapolis organizations). Third, the indigent, elderly, or dis-\nabled need not “journey all the way to their county seat each time they\nwish to exercise the franchise,” post, at 29, if they obtain a free photo\nidentification card from the BMV. While it is true that obtaining a\nbirth certificate carries with it a financial cost, the record does not\nprovide even a rough estimate of how many indigent voters lack copies\nof their birth certificates. Supposition based on extensive Internet\nresearch is not an adequate substitute for admissible evidence subject\nto cross-examination in constitutional adjudication.\n20       CRAWFORD v.

Supp. 2d, at 783. It is fair to infer\nthat partisan considerations may have played a significant\nrole in the decision to enact SEA 483. If such considera-\ntions had provided the only justification for a photo identi-\nfication requirement, we may also assume that SEA 483\nwould suffer the same fate as the poll tax at issue in\nHarper.\n   But if a nondiscriminatory law is supported by valid\nneutral justifications, those justifications should not be\ndisregarded simply because partisan interests may have\nprovided one motivation for the votes of individual legisla-\ntors. The state interests identified as justifications for\nSEA 483 are both neutral and sufficiently strong to re-\nquire us to reject petitioners’ facial attack on the statute.\nThe application of the statute to the vast majority of Indi-\nana voters is amply justified by the valid interest in pro-\ntecting “the integrity and reliability of the electoral proc-\ness.” Anderson, 460 U.

That is true enough, but for the sake of\nclarity and finality (as well as adherence to precedent), I\nprefer to decide these cases on the grounds that petition-\ners’ premise is irrelevant and that the burden at issue is\nminimal and justified.\n   To evaluate a law respecting the right to vote—whether\nit governs voter qualifications, candidate selection, or the\nvoting process—we use the approach set out in Burdick v.\nTakushi, 504 U. S. 428 (1992). This calls for application of\na deferential “important regulatory interests” standard for\nnonsevere, nondiscriminatory restrictions, reserving strict\n2       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nscrutiny for laws that severely restrict the right to vote.\nId., at 433–434 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nlead opinion resists the import of Burdick by characteriz-\ning it as simply adopting “the balancing approach” of\nAnderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780 (1983) (majority\nopinion of STEVENS, J.). See ante, at 6; see also ante, at 6–\n7, n. 8. Although Burdick liberally quoted Anderson,\nBurdick forged Anderson’s amorphous “flexible standard”\ninto something resembling an administrable rule. See\nBurdick, supra, at 434. Since Burdick, we have repeatedly\nreaffirmed the primacy of its two-track approach. See\nTimmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351,\n358 (1997); Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S. 581, 586–587\n(2005). “[S]trict scrutiny is appropriate only if the burden\nis severe.” Id., at 592. Thus, the first step is to decide\nwhether a challenged law severely burdens the right to\nvote. Ordinary and widespread burdens, such as those\nrequiring “nominal effort” of everyone, are not severe. See\nid., at 591, 593–597. Burdens are severe if they go beyond\nthe merely inconvenient. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S.\n724, 728–729 (1974) (characterizing the law in Williams v.\nRhodes, 393 U. S. 23 (1968), as “severe” because it was “so\nburdensome” as to be “ ‘virtually impossible’ ” to satisfy).\n  Of course, we have to identify a burden before we can\nweigh it. The Indiana law affects different voters differ-\nently, ante, at 14–16, but what petitioners view as the\nlaw’s several light and heavy burdens are no more than\nthe different impacts of the single burden that the law\nuniformly imposes on all voters. To vote in person in\nIndiana, everyone must have and present a photo identifi-\ncation that can be obtained for free. The State draws no\nclassifications, let alone discriminatory ones, except to\nestablish optional absentee and provisional balloting for\ncertain poor, elderly, and institutionalized voters and for\nreligious objectors. Nor are voters who already have photo\nidentifications exempted from the burden, since those\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nvoters must maintain the accuracy of the information\ndisplayed on the identifications, renew them before they\nexpire, and replace them if they are lost.\n   The Indiana photo-identification law is a generally\napplicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation, and our\nprecedents refute the view that individual impacts are\nrelevant to determining the severity of the burden it im-\nposes. In the course of concluding that the Hawaii laws at\nissue in Burdick “impose[d] only a limited burden on\nvoters’ rights to make free choices and to associate politi-\ncally through the vote,” 504 U. S., at 439, we considered\nthe laws and their reasonably foreseeable effect on voters\ngenerally. See id., at 436–437. We did not discuss\nwhether the laws had a severe effect on Mr. Burdick’s own\nright to vote, given his particular circumstances. That\nwas essentially the approach of the Burdick dissenters,\nwho would have applied strict scrutiny to the laws because\nof their effect on “some voters.” See id., at 446 (KENNEDY,\nJ., dissenting); see also id., at 448 (“The majority’s analy-\nsis ignores the inevitable and significant burden a write-in\nban imposes upon some individual voters . . . .” (emphasis\nadded)). Subsequent cases have followed Burdick’s gener-\nalized review of nondiscriminatory election laws. See, e.g.,\nTimmons, supra, at 361–362; Clingman, supra, at 590–\n591, 592–593. Indeed, Clingman’s holding that burdens\nare not severe if they are ordinary and widespread would\nbe rendered meaningless if a single plaintiff could claim a\nsevere burden.\n   Not all of our decisions predating Burdick addressed\nwhether a challenged voting regulation severely burdened\nthe right to vote, but when we began to grapple with the\nmagnitude of burdens, we did so categorically and did not\nconsider the peculiar circumstances of individual voters or\ncandidates. See, e.g., Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431,\n438–441 (1971). Thus, in Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U. S.\n752 (1973), we did not link the State’s interest in inhibit-\n4        CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ning party raiding with the petitioners’ own circumstances.\nSee id., at 760–762. And in Storer v. Brown, supra, we\nobserved that the severity of the burden of a regulation\nshould be measured according to its “nature, extent, and\nlikely impact.” Id., at 738 (emphasis added). We therefore\ninstructed the District Court to decide on remand whether\n“a reasonably diligent independent candidate [could] be\nexpected to satisfy the signature requirements, or will it\nbe only rarely that the unaffiliated candidate will succeed\nin getting on the ballot?” Id., at 742 (emphasis added).\nNotably, we did not suggest that the District Court should\nconsider whether one of the petitioners would actually find\nit more difficult than a reasonably diligent candidate to\nobtain the required signatures. What mattered was the\ngeneral assessment of the burden.\n   Insofar as our election-regulation cases rest upon the\nrequirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Ander-\nson, supra, at 786, n. 7, weighing the burden of a nondis-\ncriminatory voting law upon each voter and concomitantly\nrequiring exceptions for vulnerable voters would effec-\ntively turn back decades of equal-protection jurisprudence.\nA voter complaining about such a law’s effect on him has\nno valid equal-protection claim because, without proof of\ndiscriminatory intent, a generally applicable law with\ndisparate impact is not unconstitutional. See, e.g., Wash-\nington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 248 (1976). The Fourteenth\nAmendment does not regard neutral laws as invidious\nones, even when their burdens purportedly fall dispropor-\ntionately on a protected class. A fortiori it does not do so\nwhen, as here, the classes complaining of disparate impact\nare not even protected.* See Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S.\n——————\n  * A number of our early right-to-vote decisions, purporting to rely\nupon the Equal Protection Clause, strictly scrutinized nondiscrimina-\ntory voting laws requiring the payment of fees.

This is an area where the dos and\ndon’ts need to be known in advance of the election, and\nvoter-by-voter examination of the burdens of voting regu-\nlations would prove especially disruptive. A case-by-case\napproach naturally encourages constant litigation. Very\nfew new election regulations improve everyone’s lot, so the\npotential allegations of severe burden are endless. A State\nreducing the number of polling places would be open to the\ncomplaint it has violated the rights of disabled voters who\nlive near the closed stations. Indeed, it may even be the\ncase that some laws already on the books are especially\nburdensome for some voters, and one can predict lawsuits\ndemanding that a State adopt voting over the Internet or\nexpand absentee balloting.\n   That sort of detailed judicial supervision of the election\nprocess would flout the Constitution’s express commit-\nment of the task to the States.

Voting by absentee ballot leaves an individual without the\npossibility of receiving assistance from poll workers, and thus increases\nthe likelihood of confusion and error. More seriously, as the Supreme\nCourt of Indiana has recognized, Indiana law “treats absentee voters\ndifferently from the way it treats Election Day voters,” in the important\nsense that “an absentee ballot may not be recounted in situations\nwhere clerical error by an election officer rendered it invalid.” Horse-\nman v.

It translates into an obvious\neconomic cost (whether in work time lost, or getting and\npaying for transportation) that an Indiana voter must bear\nto obtain an ID.\n   For those voters who can afford the roundtrip, a second\nfinancial hurdle appears: in order to get photo identifica-\ntion for the first time, they need to present “ ‘a birth cer-\ntificate, a certificate of naturalization, U.

The total fees for a passport, more-\nover, are up to about $100.17 So most voters must pay at\nleast one fee to get the ID necessary to cast a regular\nballot.18 As with the travel costs, these fees are far from\nshocking on their face, but in the Burdick analysis it\nmatters that both the travel costs and the fees are dispro-\nportionately heavy for, and thus disproportionately likely\nto deter, the poor, the old, and the immobile.\n                              B\n   To be sure, Indiana has a provisional-ballot exception to\nthe ID requirement for individuals the State considers\n“indigent”19 as well as those with religious objections to\nbeing photographed, see ante, at 15 (lead opinion), and\nthis sort of exception could in theory provide a way around\nthe costs of procuring an ID.

Indiana law does not define the key\nterms “indigent” or “unable,” but I will assume for present purposes\nthat the Indiana Supreme Court will eventually construe these terms\nbroadly, so that the income threshold for indigency is at least at the\nfederal poverty level, and so that the exception covers even individuals\nwho are facing only short-term financial difficulties.\n                      Cite as: 553 U.

See 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 786 (citing Ind. Code Ann. §3–11–8–25.1\n(West Supp. 2007)). As the lead opinion recognizes,\nthough, ante, at 15, that is only the first step; to have the\nprovisional ballot counted, a voter must then appear in\nperson before the circuit court clerk or county election\nboard within 10 days of the election, to sign an affidavit\nattesting to indigency or religious objection to being pho-\ntographed (or to present an ID at that point),20 see 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 786. Unlike the trip to the BMV (which,\nassuming things go smoothly, needs to be made only once\nevery four years for renewal of nondriver photo identifica-\ntion, see id.), this one must be taken every time a poor\nperson or religious objector wishes to vote, because the\nState does not allow an affidavit to count in successive\nelections. And unlike the trip to the BMV (which at least\nhas a handful of license branches in the more populous\ncounties), a county has only one county seat. Forcing\nthese people to travel to the county seat every time they\ntry to vote is particularly onerous for the reason noted\nalready, that most counties in Indiana either lack public\ntransportation or offer only limited coverage. See supra,\nat 6–7.\n   That the need to travel to the county seat each election\namounts to a high hurdle is shown in the results of the\n2007 municipal elections in Marion County, to which\nIndiana’s Voter ID Law applied.

But for the voters who show up at the polls to vote and are there\ntold that they lack the photo identification needed to cast a regular\nballot, the Voter ID Law effectively forces them to make two trips.\n10       CRAWFORD v.

See id., at 9.\n   All of this suggests that provisional ballots do not obvi-\nate the burdens of getting photo identification. And even\nif that were not so, the provisional-ballot option would be\ninadequate for a further reason: the indigency exception\nby definition offers no relief to those voters who do not\nconsider themselves (or would not be considered) indigent\nbut as a practical matter would find it hard, for nonfinan-\ncial reasons, to get the required ID (most obviously the\ndisabled).\n                             C\n  Indiana’s Voter ID Law thus threatens to impose serious\nburdens on the voting right, even if not “severe” ones, and\nthe next question under Burdick is whether the number of\nindividuals likely to be affected is significant as well.\nRecord evidence and facts open to judicial notice answer\nyes.\n  Although the District Court found that petitioners failed\nto offer any reliable empirical study of numbers of voters\naffected, see ante, at 17 (lead opinion),21 we may accept\nthat court’s rough calculation that 43,000 voting-age\nresidents lack the kind of identification card required by\nIndiana’s law.

First, the District Court\nnoted that BMV records do not cover all forms of identification that\nmay be used to vote under the Voter ID Law (e.g., federal photo identi-\nfication, such as a passport). This is a valid consideration, but is\nunlikely to overcome the additions that must be made for the various\nfactors listed above. Second, the court noted that the BMV records do\nnot account for the exceptions to the photo identification requirement\n(such as the indigency and absentee-ballot exceptions). This factor does\nnot warrant a deduction of the 43,000 number because, as I have\nargued, the indigency exception imposes serious burdens of its own, see\nsupra, at 8–10, and the absentee-ballot exception is not a wholly\nadequate substitute for voting in person, see n. 4, supra.

We have been offered\nno reason to think that Indiana does a substantially better\njob of distributing IDs than other States.23\n  So a fair reading of the data supports the District\nCourt’s finding that around 43,000 Indiana residents lack\nthe needed identification, and will bear the burdens the\nlaw imposes. To be sure, the 43,000 figure has to be dis-\ncounted to some extent, residents of certain nursing homes\nbeing exempted from the photo identification requirement.\n458 F. Supp. 2d, at 786. But the State does not suggest\nthat this narrow exception could possibly reduce 43,000 to\nan insubstantial number.24\n——————\nDistrict Court noted that many individuals are not registered to vote.\nFor reasons I lay out in note 24, infra, I am not convinced that this fact\nis relevant at all.\n   23 Although the lead opinion expresses confidence that the percentage\n\nof voters without the necessary photo ID will steadily decrease, see\nante, at 4, n. 6, and suggests that the number may already have\ndropped, see ante, at 18, n. 20, there is reason to be less sanguine. See\nACLU Sues To Halt License Revocation, Fort Wayne J.

A large\nproportion of them are likely to be in bad shape economi-\ncally, see 472 F. 3d 949, 951 (CA7 2007) (“No doubt most\npeople who don’t have photo ID are low on the economic\nladder”); cf. Bullock v. Carter, 405 U. S. 134, 144 (1972)\n(“[W]e would ignore reality were we not to recognize that\nthis system falls with unequal weight on voters . . . accord-\ning to their economic status”).25 The Voter ID Law places\nhurdles in the way of either getting an ID or of voting\nprovisionally, and they translate into nontrivial economic\ncosts. There is accordingly no reason to doubt that a sig-\nnificant number of state residents will be discouraged or\n——————\nestimate to exclude citizens who are not registered to vote, or who are\nregistered but not planning to vote. See Brief for Respondents in No.\n07–25, p. 25; see also ante, at 17 (lead opinion) (“[T]he evidence in the\nrecord does not provide us with the number of registered voters without\nphoto identification”). But that argument is flatly contradicted by this\nCourt’s settled precedent. As our cases have recognized, disfranchise-\nment is disfranchisement, whether or not the disfranchised voter would\nhave voted if given the choice. That is why in Dunn v. Blumstein, 405\nU. S. 330 (1972), the Court did not ask whether any significant number\nof individuals deprived of the right to vote by durational residence\nrequirements would actually have chosen to vote. And in Harper v.\nVirginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663 (1966), the Court did not pause\nto consider whether any of the qualified voters deterred by the $1.50\npoll tax would have opted to vote if there had been no fee. Our cases\nmake clear that the Constitution protects an individual’s ability to vote,\nnot merely his decision to do so.\n  25 Studies in other States suggest that the burdens of an ID require-\n\nment may also fall disproportionately upon racial minorities. See\nOverton, Voter Identification, 105 Mich. L. Rev. 631, 659 (2007) (“In\n1994, the U. S.

While of course it would greatly aid a plaintiff to\nestablish his claims beyond mathematical doubt, he does\nenough to show that serious burdens are likely.\n   Thus, petitioners’ case is clearly strong enough to\nprompt more than a cursory examination of the State’s\nasserted interests.

See ante, at 7–13. But\nhaving found the Voter ID Law burdens far from trivial, I\nhave to make a rigorous assessment of “ ‘the precise inter-\nests put forward by the State as justifications for the\nburden imposed by its rule,’ [and] ‘the extent to which\nthose interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s\nrights.’ ” Burdick, 504 U. S., at 434 (quoting Anderson,\n460 U. S., at 789).\n  As this quotation from Burdick indicates, the interests\nclaimed to justify the regulatory scheme are subject to\ndiscount in two distinct ways. First, the generalities\nraised by the State have to be shaved down to the precise\n“aspect[s of claimed interests] addressed by the law at\nissue.” California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S.\n567, 584 (2000) (emphasis omitted); see ibid. (scrutiny of\nstate interests “is not to be made in the abstract, by ask-\ning whether [the interests] are highly significant values;\nbut rather by asking whether the aspect of [those inter-\nests] addressed by the law at issue is highly significant”\n                    Cite as: 553 U.

And even if the State can show\nparticularized interests addressed by the law, those inter-\nests are subject to further discount depending on “the\nextent to which [they] make it necessary to burden the\nplaintiff’s rights.” Burdick, supra, at 434 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   As the lead opinion sees it, the State has offered four\nrelated concerns that suffice to justify the Voter ID Law:\nmodernizing election procedures, combating voter fraud,\naddressing the consequences of the State’s bloated voter\nrolls, and protecting public confidence in the integrity of\nthe electoral process. See ante, at 7–13. On closer look,\nhowever, it appears that the first two (which are really\njust one) can claim modest weight at best, and the latter\ntwo if anything weaken the State’s case.\n                              A\n  The lead opinion’s discussion of the State’s reasons\nbegins with the State’s asserted interests in “election\nmodernization,” ante, at 8–10, and in combating voter\nfraud, see ante, at 11–13. Although these are given sepa-\nrate headings, any line drawn between them is unconvinc-\ning; as I understand it, the “effort to modernize elections,”\nBrief for Respondents in No. 07–25, p. 12, is not for mod-\nernity’s sake, but to reach certain practical (or political)\nobjectives.27 In any event, if a proposed modernization\nwere in fact aimless, if it were put forward as change for\nchange’s sake, a State could not justify any appreciable\nburden on the right to vote that might ensue; useless\ntechnology has no constitutional value. And in fact that is\nnot the case here. The State says that it adopted the ID\nlaw principally to combat voter fraud, and it is this claim,\n——————\n  27 See generally R. Saltman, The History and Politics of Voting Tech-\nnology: In Quest of Integrity and Public Confidence (2006) (tracing the\nhistory of changes in methods of voting in the United States, and the\nsocial and political considerations behind them).\n18      CRAWFORD v.

See Purcell, 549\nU. S., at 4 (acknowledging “the State’s compelling interest\nin preventing voter fraud”); cf. Eu v. San Francisco County\nDemocratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 231 (1989) (“A\nState indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving\nthe integrity of its election process”). But it takes several\nsteps to get beyond the level of abstraction here.\n   To begin with, requiring a voter to show photo identifi-\ncation before casting a regular ballot addresses only one\nform of voter fraud: in-person voter impersonation. The\nphoto ID requirement leaves untouched the problems of\nabsentee-ballot fraud, which (unlike in-person voter im-\npersonation) is a documented problem in Indiana, see 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 793; of registered voters voting more than\nonce (but maintaining their own identities) in different\ncounties or in different States; of felons and other disquali-\nfied individuals voting in their own names; of vote buying;\nor, for that matter, of ballot-stuffing, ballot miscounting,\nvoter intimidation, or any other type of corruption on the\npart of officials administering elections. See Brief for\nBrennan Center for Justice et al. as Amici Curiae 7.\n   And even the State’s interest in deterring a voter from\nshowing up at the polls and claiming to be someone he is\nnot must, in turn, be discounted for the fact that the State\nhas not come across a single instance of in-person voter\nimpersonation fraud in all of Indiana’s history. See 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 792–793; see also ante, at 11–13 (lead\nopinion). Neither the District Court nor the Indiana Gen-\neral Assembly that passed the Voter ID Law was given\nany evidence whatsoever of in-person voter impersonation\nfraud in the State. See 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 793. This\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

Ibid. It is also consistent with\nthe dearth of evidence of in-person voter impersonation in\nany other part of the country. See ante, at 11, n. 11 (lead\nopinion) (conceding that there are at most “scattered\ninstances of in-person voter fraud”); see also Brief for\nBrennan Center for Justice, supra, at 11–25, 25 (demon-\nstrating that “the national evidence—including the very\nevidence relied on by the courts below—suggests that the\ntype of voting fraud that may be remedied by a photo ID\nrequirement is virtually nonexistent: the ‘problem’ of voter\nimpersonation is not a real problem at all”).28\n   The State responds to the want of evidence with the\nassertion that in-person voter impersonation fraud is hard\nto detect. But this is like saying the “man who wasn’t\nthere” is hard to spot,29 and to know whether difficulty in\ndetection accounts for the lack of evidence one at least has\nto ask whether in-person voter impersonation is (or would\nbe) relatively harder to ferret out than other kinds of fraud\n(e.g., by absentee ballot) which the State has had no trou-\nble documenting.

This is in part because an\nindividual who impersonates another at the polls commits\nhis fraud in the open, under the scrutiny of local poll\nworkers who may well recognize a fraudulent voter when\nthey hear who he claims to be. See Brief for Respondents\nin No. 07–21, p. 6 (“[P]recinct workers may recognize an\nimposter, and precinct election workers have the authority\nto challenge persons appearing to vote if the election board\nmember ‘is not satisfied that a person who offers to vote is\nthe person who the person represents the person to be’ ”\n(quoting Ind. Code Ann. §3–11–8–27 (West 2006))).\n  The relative ease of discovering in-person voter imper-\nsonation is also owing to the odds that any such fraud will\nbe committed by “organized groups such as campaigns or\npolitical parties” rather than by individuals acting alone.\nL. Minnite & D. Callahan, Securing the Vote: An Analysis\nof Election Fraud 14 (2003). It simply is not worth it for\nindividuals acting alone to commit in-person voter imper-\nsonation, which is relatively ineffectual for the foolish few\nwho may commit it. If an imposter gets caught, he is\nsubject to severe criminal penalties. See, e.g., Ind. Code\nAnn. §3–14–2–9 (making it a felony “knowingly [to] vot[e]\nor offe[r] to vote at an election when the person is not\nregistered or authorized to vote”); §3–14–2–11 (with cer-\ntain exceptions, “a person who knowingly votes or offers to\nvote in a precinct except the one in which the person is\nregistered and resides” commits a felony); §3–14–2–12(1)\n(making it a felony “knowingly [to] vot[e] or mak[e] appli-\ncation to vote in an election in a name other than the\nperson’s own”); §3–14–2–12(2) (a person who, “having\nvoted once at an election, knowingly applies to vote at the\nsame election in the person’s own name or any other\nname” commits a felony); see also 42 U.

And even\nif he succeeds, the imposter gains nothing more than one\nadditional vote for his candidate. See EAC Report 9 (in-\nperson voter impersonation “is an inefficient method of\ninfluencing an election”); J. Levitt, The Truth about Voter\nFraud 7 (2007) (“[F]raud by individual voters is a singu-\nlarly foolish and ineffective way to attempt to win an\nelection. Each act of voter fraud in connection with a\nfederal election risks five years in prison and a $10,000\nfine, in addition to any state penalties. In return, it yields\nat most one incremental vote. That single extra vote is\nsimply not worth the price” (footnote omitted)); cf. 472\nF. 3d, at 951 (“[A] vote in a political election rarely has\nany instrumental value, since elections for political office\nat the state or federal level are never decided by just one\nvote” (emphasis in original)).\n   In sum, fraud by individuals acting alone, however\ndifficult to detect, is unlikely. And while there may be\ngreater incentives for organized groups to engage in broad-\ngauged in-person voter impersonation fraud, see Minnite\n& Callahan, supra, at 20, it is also far more difficult to\nconceal larger enterprises of this sort. The State’s argu-\nment about the difficulty of detecting the fraud lacks real\nforce.\n                              2\n   Nothing else the State has to say does much to bolster\nits case. The State argues, for example, that even without\nevidence of in-person voter impersonation in Indiana, it is\nenough for the State to show that “opportunities [for such\nfraud] are transparently obvious in elections without\nidentification checks,” Brief for Respondents in No. 07–25,\np. 54. Of course they are, but Indiana elections before the\nVoter ID Law were not run “without identification checks”;\n22        CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                          SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\non the contrary, as the Marion County Election Board\ninforms us, “[t]ime-tested systems were in place to detect\nin-person voter impersonation fraud before the challenged\nstatute was enacted,” Brief for Respondents in No. 07–21,\np. 6. These included hiring poll workers who were pre-\ncinct residents familiar with the neighborhood, and mak-\ning signature comparisons, each effort being supported by\nthe criminal provisions mentioned before. Id., at 6–8.\n   For that matter, the deterrence argument can do only so\nmuch work, since photo identification is itself hardly a\nfailsafe against impersonation. Indiana knows this, and\nthat is why in 2007 the State began to issue redesigned\ndriver’s licenses with digital watermarking.30 The State\nhas made this shift precisely because, in the words of its\nBMV, “visual inspection is not adequate to determine the\nauthenticity” of driver’s licenses. See Indiana BMV, su-\npra, n. 30. Indeed, the BMV explains that the digital\nwatermarks (which can be scanned using equipment that,\nso far, Indiana does not use at polling places) is needed to\n“tak[e] the guesswork out of inspection.” Ibid.31 So, at\nleast until polling places have the machines and special\nsoftware to scan the new driver’s licenses, and until all the\nlicenses with the older designs expire (the licenses issued\nafter 2006 but before the 2007 redesigning are good until\n2012, see 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 791), Indiana’s law does no\nmore than assure that any in-person voter fraud will take\nplace with fake IDs, not attempted signature forgery.\n\n——————\n   30 See Indiana BMV, Digital Drivers License: Frequently Asked Ques-\n\ntions, “What is a digital watermark and why is Indiana incorporating it\ninto their driver license?”, http://www.in.gov/bmv/3382.htm.\n   31 In the words of Indiana’s Governor, Mitch Daniels: “ ‘Not very long\n\nago, Indiana driver’s licenses were a late-night talk show joke [because\nof] the ease of their fraudulent issuance and also their duplication . . . .\n[The new design] will make particularly their duplication dramatically\nmore difficult.’ ” Udell, Digital Driver’s Licenses Designed To Stem ID\nTheft, Evansville Courier, June 7, 2007, p.

But the ultimate valuation of the particular\ninterest a State asserts has to take account of evidence\nagainst it as well as legislative judgments for it (certainly\nwhen the law is one of the most restrictive of its kind, see\nn. 26, supra), and on this record it would be unreasonable\nto accord this assumed state interest more than very\nmodest significance.32\n                             3\n  The antifraud rationale is open to skepticism on one\nfurther ground, what Burdick spoke of as an assessment of\nthe degree of necessity for the State’s particular course of\naction.

A phase-in period would have\ngiven the State time to distribute its newly designed li-\ncenses, and to make a genuine effort to get them to indi-\nviduals in need, and a period for transition is exactly what\nthe Commission on Federal Election Reform, headed by\nformer President Carter and former Secretary of State\nBaker, recommended in its report. See Building Confi-\ndence in U. S. Elections §2.5 (Sept. 2005), App. 136, 140\n(hereinafter Carter-Baker Report) (“For the next two\nfederal elections, until January 1, 2010, in states that\nrequire voters to present ID at the polls, voters who fail to\ndo so should nonetheless be allowed to cast a provisional\nballot, and their ballot would count if their signature is\nverified”). During this phase-in period, the report said,\nStates would need to make “efforts to ensure that all\nvoters are provided convenient opportunities to obtain” the\nrequired identification. Id., at 141. The former President\nand former Secretary of State explained this recommenda-\ntion in an op-ed essay:\n        “Yes, we are concerned about the approximately 12\n     percent of citizens who lack a driver’s license. So we\n     proposed that states finally assume the responsibility\n     to seek out citizens to both register voters and provide\n     them with free ID’s that meet federal standards.\n     States should open new offices, use social service\n     agencies and deploy mobile offices to register voters.\n     By connecting ID’s to registration, voting participa-\n     tion will be expanded.” Carter & Baker, Voting Re-\n     form is in the Cards, N.

Individu-\nals unable to get photo identification are forced to travel to\nthe county seat every time they wish to exercise the fran-\nchise, and they have to get there within 10 days of the\nelection. See supra, at 8–10. Nothing about the State’s\ninterest in fighting voter fraud justifies this requirement\nof a post-election trip to the county seat instead of some\nverification process at the polling places.\n   In briefing this Court, the State responds by pointing to\nan interest in keeping lines at polling places short. See\nBrief for Respondents in No. 07–25, p. 58. It warns that\n“[i]f election workers—a scarce resource in any election—\nmust attend to the details of validating provisional ballots,\nvoters may have to wait longer to vote,” and it assures us\nthat “[n]othing deters voting so much as long lines at the\npolls.” Ibid. But this argument fails on its own terms, for\nwhatever might be the number of individuals casting a\nprovisional ballot, the State could simply allow voters to\nsign the indigency affidavit at the polls subject to review\nthere after the election.33 After all, the Voter ID Law\nalready requires voters lacking photo identification to\n——————\n  33 Florida has accommodated voters in this manner.      In Florida a\nvoter who casts a provisional ballot may have that vote counted if the\nvoter’s signature on the provisional-ballot certification matches the\nsignature on the voter’s registration. See Fla. Stat. Ann. §§101.043,\n101.048. The voter is not required to make a second trip to have her\nprovisional ballot counted.\n26      CRAWFORD v.

Supp. 2d, at 786.\n   Indeed, the State’s argument more than fails; it back-\nfires, in implicitly conceding that a not-insignificant num-\nber of individuals will need to rely on the burdensome\nprovisional-ballot mechanism. What is more, as the Dis-\ntrict Court found, the Voter ID Law itself actually in-\ncreases the likelihood of delay at the polls. Since any\nminor discrepancy between a voter’s photo identification\ncard and the registration information may lead to a chal-\nlenge, “the opportunities for presenting challenges ha[ve]\nincreased as a result of the photo identification require-\nments.” Id., at 789; cf. 472 F. 3d, at 955 (Evans, J., dis-\nsenting) (“The potential for mischief with this law is obvi-\nous. Does the name on the ID ‘conform’ to the name on\nthe voter registration list?

The two remain-\ning justifications, meanwhile, actually weaken the State’s\ncase.\n   The lead opinion agrees with the State that “the infla-\ntion of its voter rolls is further support for its enactment\nof” the Voter ID Law.

This is a puzzling\nconclusion, given the fact, which the lead opinion notes,\nthat the National Government filed a complaint against\nIndiana, containing this allegation:\n     “Indiana has failed to conduct a general program that\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

S. C.\n§1973gg–6.\n   How any of this can justify restrictions on the right to\nvote is difficult to say. The State is simply trying to take\nadvantage of its own wrong: if it is true that the State’s\nfear of in-person voter impersonation fraud arises from its\nbloated voter checklist, the answer to the problem is in the\nState’s own hands. The claim that the State has an inter-\nest in addressing a symptom of the problem (alleged im-\npersonation) rather than the problem itself (the negli-\ngently maintained bloated rolls) is thus self-defeating; it\nshows that the State has no justifiable need to burden the\nright to vote as it does, and it suggests that the State is\nnot as serious about combating fraud as it claims to be.34\n   The State’s final justification, its interest in safeguard-\ning voter confidence, similarly collapses. The problem\nwith claiming this interest lies in its connection to the\nbloated voter rolls; the State has come up with nothing to\nsuggest that its citizens doubt the integrity of the State’s\n\n——————\n  34 The voting-rolls argument also suggests that it would not be so\n\ndifficult to detect in-person voter fraud after all. If it is true that\npractitioners of fraud are most likely to vote in the name of registered\nvoters whom they know to have died or left the jurisdiction, then\nIndiana could simply audit its voting records to examine whether, and\nhow often, in-person votes were cast using these invalid registrations.\n28      CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nelectoral process, except its own failure to maintain its\nrolls. The answer to this problem is not to burden the\nright to vote, but to end the official negligence.\n   It should go without saying that none of this is to deny\nStates’ legitimate interest in safeguarding public confi-\ndence. The Court has, for example, recognized that fight-\ning perceptions of political corruption stemming from large\npolitical contributions is a legitimate and substantial state\ninterest, underlying not only campaign finance laws, but\nbribery and antigratuity statutes as well. See Nixon v.\nShrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 390\n(2000). But the force of the interest depends on the facts\n(or plausibility of the assumptions) said to justify invoking\nit. See id., at 391 (“The quantum of empirical evidence\nneeded to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative\njudgments will vary up or down with the novelty and\nplausibility of the justification raised”). While we found in\nNixon that “there is little reason to doubt that sometimes\nlarge contributions will work actual corruption of our\npolitical system, and no reason to question the existence of\na corresponding suspicion among voters,” id., at 395, there\nis plenty of reason to be doubtful here, both about the\nreality and the perception. It is simply not plausible to\nassume here, with no evidence of in-person voter imper-\nsonation fraud in a State, and very little of it nationwide,\nthat a public perception of such fraud is nevertheless\n“inherent” in an election system providing severe criminal\npenalties for fraud and mandating signature checks at the\npolls. Cf. id., at 390 (“[T]he perception of corruption [is]\n‘inherent in a regime of large individual financial contri-\nbutions’ to candidates for public office” (quoting Buckley v.\nValeo, 424 U.

The State\nrecognizes that tens of thousands of qualified voters lack\nthe necessary federally issued or state-issued identifica-\ntion, but it insists on implementing the requirement im-\nmediately, without allowing a transition period for tar-\ngeted efforts to distribute the required identification to\nindividuals who need it. The State hardly even tries to\nexplain its decision to force indigents or religious objectors\nto travel all the way to their county seats every time they\nwish to vote, and if there is any waning of confidence in\nthe administration of elections it probably owes more to\nthe State’s violation of federal election law than to any\nimposters at the polling places. It is impossible to say, on\nthis record, that the State’s interest in adopting its sig-\nnally inhibiting photo identification requirement has been\nshown to outweigh the serious burdens it imposes on the\nright to vote.\n   If more were needed to condemn this law, our own\nprecedent would provide it, for the calculation revealed in\nthe Indiana statute crosses a line when it targets the poor\nand the weak. Cf. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780,\n793 (1983) (“[I]t is especially difficult for the State to\njustify a restriction that limits political participation by an\nidentifiable political group whose members share a par-\nticular viewpoint, associational preference, or economic\nstatus”). If the Court’s decision in Harper v. Virginia Bd.\nof Elections, 383 U. S. 663 (1966), stands for anything, it is\nthat being poor has nothing to do with being qualified to\nvote. Harper made clear that “[t]o introduce wealth or\npayment of a fee as a measure of a voter’s qualifications is\nto introduce a capricious or irrelevant factor.” Id., at 668.\nThe State’s requirements here, that people without cars\ntravel to a motor vehicle registry and that the poor who\nfail to do that get to their county seats within 10 days of\nevery election, likewise translate into unjustified economic\n30      CRAWFORD v.

It imposes a burden upon\nsome voters, but it does so in order to prevent fraud, to\nbuild confidence in the voting system, and thereby to\nmaintain the integrity of the voting process. In determin-\ning whether this statute violates the Federal Constitution,\nI would balance the voting-related interests that the stat-\nute affects, asking “whether the statute burdens any one\nsuch interest in a manner out of proportion to the statute’s\nsalutary effects upon the others (perhaps, but not neces-\nsarily, because of the existence of a clearly superior, less\nrestrictive alternative).” Nixon v.

See Report of the Commission on Federal\nElection Reform, Building Confidence in U. S. Elections\n§2.5 (Sept. 2005) (Carter-Baker Report), App. 136–144.\nBecause the record does not discredit the Carter-Baker\nReport or suggest that Indiana is exceptional, I see noth-\ning to prevent Indiana’s Legislature (or a federal court\nconsidering the constitutionality of the statute) from\ntaking account of the legislatively relevant facts the report\nsets forth and paying attention to its expert conclusions.\nThus, I share the general view of the lead opinion insofar\nas it holds that the Constitution does not automatically\nforbid Indiana from enacting a photo ID requirement.\nWere I also to believe, as JUSTICE STEVENS believes, that\nthe burden imposed by the Indiana statute on eligible\nvoters who lack photo IDs is indeterminate “on the basis of\nthe record that has been made in this litigation,” ante, at\n18, or were I to believe, as JUSTICE SCALIA believes, that\nthe burden the statute imposes is “minimal” or “justified,”\nante, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment), then I too\nwould reject the petitioners’ facial attack, primarily for the\nreasons set forth in Part II of the lead opinion, see ante, at\n7–13.\n  I cannot agree, however, with JUSTICE STEVENS’ or\nJUSTICE SCALIA’s assessment of the burdens imposed by\nthe statute. The Carter-Baker Commission conditioned its\nrecommendation upon the States’ willingness to ensure\nthat the requisite photo IDs “be easily available and is-\nsued free of charge” and that the requirement be “phased\nin” over two federal election cycles, to ease the transition.\nCarter-Baker Report, at App. 139, 140.

See ante, at 6–7\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting) (noting that out of Indiana’s 92\ncounties, 21 have no public transportation system at all\nand 32 others restrict public transportation to regional\ncounty service). For another, many of these individuals\nmay be uncertain about how to obtain the underlying\ndocumentation, usually a passport or a birth certificate,\nupon which the statute insists. And some may find the\ncosts associated with these documents unduly burdensome\n(up to $12 for a copy of a birth certificate; up to $100 for a\npassport). By way of comparison, this Court previously\nfound unconstitutionally burdensome a poll tax of $1.50\n(less than $10 today, inflation-adjusted). See Harper v.\nVirginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663, 664 n. 1, 666\n(1966); ante, at 30 (SOUTER, J., dissenting). Further,\nIndiana’s exception for voters who cannot afford this cost\nimposes its own burden: a postelection trip to the county\nclerk or county election board to sign an indigency affida-\nvit after each election. See ante, at 8–10 (same).\n   By way of contrast, two other States—Florida and Geor-\ngia—have put into practice photo ID requirements signifi-\ncantly less restrictive than Indiana’s. Under the Florida\nlaw, the range of permissible forms of photo ID is substan-\ntially greater than in Indiana. See Fla. Stat. §101.043(1)\n(West Supp. 2008) (including employee badge or ID, a\ndebit or credit card, a student ID, a retirement center ID,\na neighborhood association ID, and a public assistance\nID). Moreover, a Florida voter who lacks photo ID may\ncast a provisional ballot at the polling place that will be\n4       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncounted if the State determines that his signature\nmatches the one on his voter registration form.\n§§101.043(2); 101.048(2)(b).\n  Georgia restricts voters to a more limited list of accept-\nable photo IDs than does Florida, but accepts in addition\nto proof of voter registration a broader range of underlying\ndocumentation than does Indiana. See Ga. Code Ann.\n§21–2–417 (Supp. 2007); Ga. Comp. Rules & Regs., Rule\n183–1–20.01 (2008) (permissible underlying documents\ninclude a paycheck stub, Social Security, Medicare, or\nMedicaid statement, school transcript, or federal affidavit\nof birth, as long as the document includes the voter’s full\nname and date of birth). Moreover, a Federal District\nCourt found that Georgia “has undertaken a serious,\nconcerted effort to notify voters who may lack Photo ID\ncards of the Photo ID requirement, to inform those voters\nof the availability of free [State-issued] Photo ID cards or\nfree Voter ID cards, to instruct the voters concerning how\nto obtain the cards, and to advise the voters that they can\nvote absentee by mail without a Photo ID.” Common\nCause/Georgia v. Billups, 504 F. Supp. 2d 1333, 1380 (ND\nGa. 2007). While Indiana allows only certain groups such\nas the elderly and disabled to vote by absentee ballot, in\nGeorgia any voter may vote absentee without providing\nany excuse, and (except where required by federal law)\nneed not present a photo ID in order to do so. Compare\nInd. Code §3–11–4–1 (West 2006) with Ga. Code Ann.\n§21–2–381 (Supp. 2007). Finally, neither Georgia nor\nFlorida insists, as Indiana does, that indigent voters travel\neach election cycle to potentially distant places for the\npurposes of signing an indigency affidavit.\n  The record nowhere provides a convincing reason why\nIndiana’s photo ID requirement must impose greater\nburdens than those of other States, or than the Carter-\nBaker Commission recommended nationwide. Nor is\nthere any reason to think that there are proportionately\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

And I need not\ndetermine the constitutionality of Florida’s or Georgia’s\nrequirements (matters not before us), in order to conclude\nthat Indiana’s requirement imposes a significantly\nharsher, unjustified burden.\n   Of course, the Carter-Baker Report is not the Constitu-\ntion of the United States. But its findings are highly\nrelevant to both legislative and judicial determinations of\nthe reasonableness of a photo ID requirement; to the\nrelated necessity of assuring that all those eligible to vote\npossess the requisite IDs; and to the presence of alterna-\ntive methods of assuring that possession, methods that are\nsuperior to those that Indiana’s statute sets forth. The\nCommission’s findings, taken together with the considera-\ntions set forth in Part II of JUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion, and\nPart II of JUSTICE SOUTER’s dissenting opinion, lead me to\nthe conclusion that while the Constitution does not in\ngeneral forbid Indiana from enacting a photo ID require-\nment, this statute imposes a disproportionate burden upon\nthose without valid photo IDs.
