Argued January 9, 2008\u2014Decided April 28, 2008*\nAfter Indiana enacted an election law (SEA 483) requiring citizens vot-\n  ing in person to present government-issued photo identification, peti-\n  tioners filed separate suits challenging the law\u2019s constitutionality.\n  Following discovery, the District Court granted respondents sum-\n  mary judgment, finding the evidence in the record insufficient to\n  support a facial attack on the statute\u2019s validity. In affirming, the\n  Seventh Circuit declined to judge the law by the strict standard set\n  for poll taxes in Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663,\n  finding the burden on voters offset by the benefit of reducing the risk\n  of fraud.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n472 F. 3d 949, affirmed.\n    JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE KEN-\n  NEDY, concluded that the evidence in the record does not support a fa-\n  cial attack on SEA 483\u2019s validity. Pp. 5\u201320.\n    (a) Under Harper, even rational restrictions on the right to vote are\n  invidious if they are unrelated to voter qualifications. However,\n  \u201ceven handed restrictions\u201d protecting the \u201cintegrity and reliability of\n  the electoral process itself\u201d satisfy Harper\u2019s standard.

MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    288\u2013289. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) Each of Indiana\u2019s asserted interests is unquestionably relevant\n    to its interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the elec-\n    toral process. The first is the interest in deterring and detecting\n    voter fraud. Indiana has a valid interest in participating in a na-\n    tionwide effort to improve and modernize election procedures criti-\n    cized as antiquated and inefficient. Indiana also claims a particular\n    interest in preventing voter fraud in response to the problem of voter\n    registration rolls with a large number of names of persons who are\n    either deceased or no longer live in Indiana. While the record con-\n    tains no evidence that the fraud SEA 483 addresses\u2014in-person voter\n    impersonation at polling places\u2014has actually occurred in Indiana,\n    such fraud has occurred in other parts of the country, and Indiana\u2019s\n    own experience with voter fraud in a 2003 mayoral primary demon-\n    strates a real risk that voter fraud could affect a close election\u2019s out-\n    come. There is no question about the legitimacy or importance of a\n    State\u2019s interest in counting only eligible voters\u2019 votes. Finally, Indi-\n    ana\u2019s interest in protecting public confidence in elections, while\n    closely related to its interest in preventing voter fraud, has inde-\n    pendent significance, because such confidence encourages citizen par-\n    ticipation in the democratic process. Pp. 7\u201313.\n       (c) The relevant burdens here are those imposed on eligible voters\n    who lack photo identification cards that comply with SEA 483. Be-\n    cause Indiana\u2019s cards are free, the inconvenience of going to the Bu-\n    reau of Motor Vehicles, gathering required documents, and posing for\n    a photograph does not qualify as a substantial burden on most voters\u2019\n    right to vote, or represent a significant increase over the usual bur-\n    dens of voting. The severity of the somewhat heavier burden that\n    may be placed on a limited number of persons\u2014e.g., elderly persons\n    born out-of-state, who may have difficulty obtaining a birth certifi-\n    cate\u2014is mitigated by the fact that eligible voters without photo iden-\n    tification may cast provisional ballots that will be counted if they\n    execute the required affidavit at the circuit court clerk\u2019s office. Even\n    assuming that the burden may not be justified as to a few voters, that\n    conclusion is by no means sufficient to establish petitioners\u2019 right to\n    the relief they seek. Pp. 13\u201316.\n       (d) Petitioners bear a heavy burden of persuasion in seeking to in-\n    validate SEA 483 in all its applications. This Court\u2019s reasoning in\n    Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552\n    U. S. ___, applies with added force here. Petitioners argue that Indi-\n    ana\u2019s interests do not justify the burden imposed on voters who can-\n    not afford or obtain a birth certificate and who must make a second\n    trip to the circuit court clerk\u2019s office, but it is not possible to quantify,\n    based on the evidence in the record, either that burden\u2019s magnitude\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  or the portion of the burden that is fully justified. A facial challenge\n  must fail where the statute has a \u201c \u2018plainly legitimate sweep.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n  ___. When considering SEA 483\u2019s broad application to all Indiana\n  voters, it \u201cimposes only a limited burden on voters\u2019 rights.\u201d Burdick\n  v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 439. The \u201cprecise interests\u201d advanced by\n  Indiana are therefore sufficient to defeat petitioners\u2019 facial challenge.\n  Id., at 434. Pp. 16\u201320.\n     (e) Valid neutral justifications for a nondiscriminatory law, such as\n  SEA 483, should not be disregarded simply because partisan inter-\n  ests may have provided one motivation for the votes of individual leg-\n  islators. P. 20.\n     JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE ALITO, was\n  of the view that petitioners\u2019 premise that the voter-identification law\n  might have imposed a special burden on some voters is irrelevant.\n  The law should be upheld because its overall burden is minimal and\n  justified. A law respecting the right to vote should be evaluated un-\n  der the approach in Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, which calls for\n  application of a deferential, \u201cimportant regulatory interests\u201d stan-\n  dard for nonsevere, nondiscriminatory restrictions, reserving strict\n  scrutiny for laws that severely restrict the right to vote, id., at 433\u2013\n  434. The different ways in which Indiana\u2019s law affects different vot-\n  ers are no more than different impacts of the single burden that the\n  law uniformly imposes on all voters: To vote in person, everyone must\n  have and present a photo identification that can be obtained for free.\n  This is a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation.\n  The law\u2019s universally applicable requirements are eminently reason-\n  able because the burden of acquiring, possessing, and showing a free\n  photo identification is not a significant increase over the usual voting\n  burdens, and the State\u2019s stated interests are sufficient to sustain that\n  minimal burden.

Code Ann. \u00a73\u201311\u20137.5\u20132.5(c) (West 2006). If the election board\ndetermines that the challenge to the affiant was based solely on a\nfailure to present photo identification, the \u201ccounty election board shall\n. . . find that the voter\u2019s provisional ballot is valid.\u201d \u00a73\u201311\u20137.5\u20132.5(d).\n    3 Voters registering to vote for the first time in Indiana must abide by\n\nthe requirements of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), 116\nStat. 1666, described infra, at 8\u20139.\n    4 Indiana previously imposed a fee on all residents seeking a state-\n\nissued photo identification. At the same time that the Indiana Legisla-\nture enacted SEA 483, it also directed the Bureau of Motor Vehicles\n(BMV) to remove all fees for state-issued photo identification for indi-\nviduals without a driver\u2019s license who are at least 18 years old.

A second suit seeking the\nsame relief was brought on behalf of two elected officials\nand several nonprofit organizations representing groups of\nelderly, disabled, poor, and minority voters.5 The cases\nwere consolidated, and the State of Indiana intervened to\ndefend the validity of the statute.\n   The complaints in the consolidated cases allege that the\nnew law substantially burdens the right to vote in viola-\ntion of the Fourteenth Amendment; that it is neither a\nnecessary nor appropriate method of avoiding election\nfraud; and that it will arbitrarily disfranchise qualified\nvoters who do not possess the required identification and\nwill place an unjustified burden on those who cannot\nreadily obtain such identification. Second Amended Com-\nplaint in No. 1: 05\u2013CV\u20130634\u2013SEB\u2013VSS (SD Ind.), pp. 6\u20139\n(hereinafter Second Amended Complaint).\n   After discovery, District Judge Barker prepared a com-\nprehensive 70-page opinion explaining her decision to\ngrant defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. 458\nF. Supp. 2d 775 (SD Ind. 2006). She found that petition-\ners had \u201cnot introduced evidence of a single, individual\nIndiana resident who will be unable to vote as a result of\nSEA 483 or who will have his or her right to vote unduly\nburdened by its requirements.\u201d Id., at 783. She rejected\n\u201cas utterly incredible and unreliable\u201d an expert\u2019s report\nthat up to 989,000 registered voters in Indiana did not\npossess either a driver\u2019s license or other acceptable photo\nidentification. Id., at 803. She estimated that as of 2005,\nwhen the statute was enacted, around 43,000 Indiana\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Specifically, the plaintiffs were William Crawford, Joseph Simpson,\n\nConcerned Clergy of Indianapolis, Indianapolis Resource Center for\nIndependent Living, Indiana Coalition on Housing and Homeless\nIssues, Indianapolis Branch of the National Association for the Ad-\nvancement of Colored People, and United Senior Action of Indiana.\nComplaint in No. 49012050 4PL01 6207 (Super. Ct. Marion Cty., Ind.,\nApr. 28, 2005), p. 2.\n4        CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nresidents lacked a state-issued driver\u2019s license or identifi-\ncation card. Id., at 807.6\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 472\nF. 3d 949 (CA7 2007). The majority first held that the\nDemocrats had standing to bring a facial challenge to the\nconstitutionality of SEA 483. Next, noting the absence of\nany plaintiffs who claimed that the law would deter them\nfrom voting, the Court of Appeals inferred that \u201cthe moti-\nvation for the suit is simply that the law may require the\nDemocratic Party and the other organizational plaintiffs\nto work harder to get every last one of their supporters to\nthe polls.\u201d Id., at 952. It rejected the argument that the\nlaw should be judged by the same strict standard applica-\nble to a poll tax because the burden on voters was offset by\nthe benefit of reducing the risk of fraud. The dissenting\njudge, viewing the justification for the law as \u201chollow\u201d\u2014\nmore precisely as \u201ca not-too-thinly-veiled attempt to dis-\ncourage election-day turnout by certain folks believed to\nskew Democratic\u201d\u2014would have applied a stricter stan-\ndard, something he described as \u201cclose to \u2018strict scrutiny\nlight.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 954, 956 (opinion of Evans, J.). In his view,\nthe \u201claw imposes an undue burden on a recognizable\nsegment of potential eligible voters\u201d and therefore violates\ntheir rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments\nto the Constitution. Id., at 956\u2013957.\n   Four judges voted to grant a petition for rehearing en\nbanc. 484 F. 3d 437 (CA7 2007) (Wood, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc). Because we agreed with\ntheir assessment of the importance of these cases, we\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 She added: \u201cIn other words, an estimated 99% of Indiana\u2019s voting\n\nage population already possesses the necessary photo identification to\nvote under the requirements of SEA 483.\u201d 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 807.\nGiven the availability of free photo identification and greater public\nawareness of the new statutory requirement, presumably that percent-\nage has increased since SEA 483 was enacted and will continue to\nincrease in the future.\n                    Cite as: 553 U.

We are, however,\npersuaded that the District Court and the Court of Ap-\npeals correctly concluded that the evidence in the record is\nnot sufficient to support a facial attack on the validity of\nthe entire statute, and thus affirm.7\n                               I\n   In Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663\n(1966), the Court held that Virginia could not condition\nthe right to vote in a state election on the payment of a\npoll tax of $1.50. We rejected the dissenters\u2019 argument\nthat the interest in promoting civic responsibility by weed-\ning out those voters who did not care enough about public\naffairs to pay a small sum for the privilege of voting pro-\nvided a rational basis for the tax. See id., at 685 (opinion\nof Harlan, J.). Applying a stricter standard, we concluded\nthat a State \u201cviolates the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment whenever it makes the affluence\nof the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard.\u201d\nId., at 666 (opinion of the Court). We used the term \u201cin-\nvidiously discriminate\u201d to describe conduct prohibited\nunder that standard, noting that we had previously held\nthat while a State may obviously impose \u201creasonable\nresidence restrictions on the availability of the ballot,\u201d it\n\u201cmay not deny the opportunity to vote to a bona fide resi-\ndent merely because he is a member of the armed ser-\nvices.\u201d Id., at 666\u2013667 (citing Carrington v. Rash, 380\nU. S. 89, 96 (1965)). Although the State\u2019s justification for\nthe tax was rational, it was invidious because it was ir-\nrelevant to the voter\u2019s qualifications.\n   Thus, under the standard applied in Harper, even ra-\ntional restrictions on the right to vote are invidious if they\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 We also agree with the unanimous view of those judges that the\nDemocrats have standing to challenge the validity of SEA 483 and that\nthere is no need to decide whether the other petitioners also have\nstanding.\n6        CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                       Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nare unrelated to voter qualifications. In Anderson v.\nCelebrezze, 460 U. S. 780 (1983), however, we confirmed\nthe general rule that \u201cevenhanded restrictions that protect\nthe integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself\u201d\nare not invidious and satisfy the standard set forth in\nHarper. 460 U. S., at 788, n. 9. Rather than applying any\n\u201clitmus test\u201d that would neatly separate valid from invalid\nrestrictions, we concluded that a court must identify and\nevaluate the interests put forward by the State as justifi-\ncations for the burden imposed by its rule, and then make\nthe \u201chard judgment\u201d that our adversary system demands.\n   In later election cases we have followed Anderson\u2019s\nbalancing approach. Thus, in Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S.\n279, 288\u2013289 (1992), after identifying the burden Illinois\nimposed on a political party\u2019s access to the ballot, we\n\u201ccalled for the demonstration of a corresponding interest\nsufficiently weighty to justify the limitation,\u201d and con-\ncluded that the \u201csevere restriction\u201d was not justified by a\nnarrowly drawn state interest of compelling importance.\nLater, in Burdick v.

However slight that burden\nmay appear, as Harper demonstrates, it must be justified\nby relevant and legitimate state interests \u201csufficiently\nweighty to justify the limitation.\u201d Norman, 502 U. S.,\nat 288\u2013289. We therefore begin our analysis of the con-\nstitutionality of Indiana\u2019s statute by focusing on those\ninterests.\n                               II\n   The State has identified several state interests that\narguably justify the burdens that SEA 483 imposes on\nvoters and potential voters. While petitioners argue that\nthe statute was actually motivated by partisan concerns\nand dispute both the significance of the State\u2019s interests\nand the magnitude of any real threat to those interests,\nthey do not question the legitimacy of the interests the\nState has identified. Each is unquestionably relevant to\nthe State\u2019s interest in protecting the integrity and reliabil-\nity of the electoral process.\n   The first is the interest in deterring and detecting voter\nfraud. The State has a valid interest in participating in a\nnationwide effort to improve and modernize election pro-\ncedures that have been criticized as antiquated and ineffi-\ncient.9 The State also argues that it has a particular\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nadherence to Anderson, see 504 U. S., at 434, and repeatedly cited\nAnderson, see 504 U. S., at 436, n. 5, 440, n. 9, 441. To be sure, Burdick\nrejected the argument that strict scrutiny applies to all laws imposing a\nburden on the right to vote; but in its place, the Court applied the\n\u201c \u2018flexible standard\u2019 \u201d set forth in Anderson. Burdick surely did not\ncreate a novel \u201cdeferential \u2018important regulatory interests\u2019 standard.\u201d\nSee post, at 1\u20132.\n    9 See National Commission on Federal Election Reform, To Assure\n\nPride and Confidence in the Electoral Process 18 (2002) (with Honorary\nCo-chairs former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter).\n8       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ninterest in preventing voter fraud in response to a problem\nthat is in part the product of its own maladministration\u2014\nnamely, that Indiana\u2019s voter registration rolls include a\nlarge number of names of persons who are either deceased\nor no longer live in Indiana. Finally, the State relies on its\ninterest in safeguarding voter confidence. Each of these\ninterests merits separate comment.\nElection Modernization\n   Two recently enacted federal statutes have made it\nnecessary for States to reexamine their election proce-\ndures. Both contain provisions consistent with a State\u2019s\nchoice to use government-issued photo identification as a\nrelevant source of information concerning a citizen\u2019s eligi-\nbility to vote.\n   In the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA),\n107 Stat. 77, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973gg et seq., Congress estab-\nlished procedures that would both increase the number of\nregistered voters and protect the integrity of the electoral\nprocess. \u00a71973gg. The statute requires state motor vehi-\ncle driver\u2019s license applications to serve as voter registra-\ntion applications. \u00a71973gg\u20133. While that requirement has\nincreased the number of registered voters, the statute also\ncontains a provision restricting States\u2019 ability to remove\nnames from the lists of registered voters. \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(3).\nThese protections have been partly responsible for inflated\nlists of registered voters. For example, evidence credited\nby Judge Barker estimated that as of 2004 Indiana\u2019s voter\nrolls were inflated by as much as 41.4%, see 458 F. Supp.\n2d, at 793, and data collected by the Election Assistance\nCommittee in 2004 indicated that 19 of 92 Indiana coun-\nties had registration totals exceeding 100% of the 2004\nvoting-age population, Dept. of Justice Complaint in\nUnited States v. Indiana, No. 1:06\u2013cv\u20131000\u2013RLY\u2013TAB\n(SD Ind., June 27, 2006), p. 4, App. 313.\n   In HAVA, Congress required every State to create and\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

HAVA\nalso requires the States to verify voter information con-\ntained in a voter registration application and specifies\neither an \u201capplicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license number\u201d or \u201cthe last\n4 digits of the applicant\u2019s social security number\u201d as\nacceptable verifications. \u00a715483(a)(5)(A)(i). If an indi-\nvidual has neither number, the State is required to\nassign the applicant a voter identification number.\n\u00a715483(a)(5)(A)(ii).\n   HAVA also imposes new identification requirements for\nindividuals registering to vote for the first time who sub-\nmit their applications by mail. If the voter is casting his\nballot in person, he must present local election officials\nwith written identification, which may be either \u201ca current\nand valid photo identification\u201d or another form of docu-\nmentation such as a bank statement or paycheck.\n\u00a715483(b)(2)(A). If the voter is voting by mail, he must\ninclude a copy of the identification with his ballot. A voter\nmay also include a copy of the documentation with his\napplication or provide his driver\u2019s license number or Social\nSecurity number for verification. \u00a715483(b)(3). Finally, in\na provision entitled \u201cFail-safe voting,\u201d HAVA authorizes\nthe casting of provisional ballots by challenged voters.\n\u00a715483(b)(2)(B).\n   Of course, neither HAVA nor NVRA required Indiana to\nenact SEA 483, but they do indicate that Congress be-\nlieves that photo identification is one effective method of\nestablishing a voter\u2019s qualification to vote and that the\nintegrity of elections is enhanced through improved tech-\nnology. That conclusion is also supported by a report\nissued shortly after the enactment of SEA 483 by the\nCommission on Federal Election Reform chaired by former\nPresident Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State\nJames A. Baker III, which is a part of the record in these\ncases. In the introduction to their discussion of voter\n10       CRAWFORD v.

In the old days and in small towns where\n     everyone knows each other, voters did not need to\n     identify themselves. But in the United States, where\n     40 million people move each year, and in urban areas\n     where some people do not even know the people living\n     in their own apartment building let alone their pre-\n     cinct, some form of identification is needed.\n        \u201cThere is no evidence of extensive fraud in U. S.\n     elections or of multiple voting, but both occur, and it\n     could affect the outcome of a close election. The elec-\n     toral system cannot inspire public confidence if no\n     safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm\n     the identity of voters.

The\nrecord contains no evidence of any such fraud actually\noccurring in Indiana at any time in its history. Moreover,\npetitioners argue that provisions of the Indiana Criminal\nCode punishing such conduct as a felony provide adequate\nprotection against the risk that such conduct will occur in\nthe future. It remains true, however, that flagrant exam-\nples of such fraud in other parts of the country have been\ndocumented throughout this Nation\u2019s history by respected\nhistorians and journalists,11 that occasional examples have\nsurfaced in recent years,12 and that Indiana\u2019s own experi-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(prepared by Election Data Services, Inc.), online at http://\nwww.eac.gov/clearinghouse/clearinghouse/2004-election-day-survey (all\nInternet materials as visited Apr. 16, 2008, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file).

Moreover, the interest in orderly administration\nand accurate recordkeeping provides a sufficient justifica-\ntion for carefully identifying all voters participating in the\nelection process. While the most effective method of pre-\nventing election fraud may well be debatable, the propri-\nety of doing so is perfectly clear.\n   In its brief, the State argues that the inflation of its\nvoter rolls provides further support for its enactment of\nSEA 483.

Even though Indiana\u2019s own negli-\ngence may have contributed to the serious inflation of its\nregistration lists when SEA 483 was enacted, the fact of\ninflated voter rolls does provide a neutral and nondis-\ncriminatory reason supporting the State\u2019s decision to\nrequire photo identification.\nSafeguarding Voter Confidence\n  Finally, the State contends that it has an interest in\nprotecting public confidence \u201cin the integrity and legiti-\nmacy of representative government.\u201d Brief for State Re-\nspondents, No. 07-25, p. 53.

Burdens of that sort arising from\nlife\u2019s vagaries, however, are neither so serious nor so\nfrequent as to raise any question about the constitutional-\nity of SEA 483; the availability of the right to cast a provi-\nsional ballot provides an adequate remedy for problems of\nthat character.\n   The burdens that are relevant to the issue before us are\nthose imposed on persons who are eligible to vote but do\nnot possess a current photo identification that complies\nwith the requirements of SEA 483.16 The fact that most\nvoters already possess a valid driver\u2019s license, or some\nother form of acceptable identification, would not save the\nstatute under our reasoning in Harper, if the State re-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 For a survey of state practice, see Brief for Texas et al. as Amici\nCuriae 10\u201314, and nn. 1\u201323.\n  16 Ind.

But just as other States provide free voter\nregistration cards, the photo identification cards issued by\nIndiana\u2019s BMV are also free. For most voters who need\nthem, the inconvenience of making a trip to the BMV,\ngathering the required documents, and posing for a photo-\ngraph surely does not qualify as a substantial burden on\nthe right to vote, or even represent a significant increase\nover the usual burdens of voting.17\n   Both evidence in the record and facts of which we may\ntake judicial notice, however, indicate that a somewhat\nheavier burden may be placed on a limited number of\npersons. They include elderly persons born out-of-state,\nwho may have difficulty obtaining a birth certificate;18\npersons who because of economic or other personal limita-\ntions may find it difficult either to secure a copy of their\nbirth certificate or to assemble the other required docu-\nmentation to obtain a state-issued identification; homeless\npersons; and persons with a religious objection to being\nphotographed. If we assume, as the evidence suggests,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 To obtain a photo identification card a person must present at least\none \u201cprimary\u201d document, which can be a birth certificate, certificate of\nnaturalization, U.

Indiana, like most States, charges a fee for obtaining a copy of\none\u2019s birth certificate. This fee varies by county and is currently\nbetween $3 and $12.

To do so, however, they must travel to the circuit\ncourt clerk\u2019s office within 10 days to execute the required\naffidavit. It is unlikely that such a requirement would\npose a constitutional problem unless it is wholly unjusti-\nfied. And even assuming that the burden may not be\njustified as to a few voters,19 that conclusion is by no\nmeans sufficient to establish petitioners\u2019 right to the relief\nthey seek in this litigation.\n                            IV\n  Given the fact that petitioners have advanced a broad\nattack on the constitutionality of SEA 483, seeking relief\nthat would invalidate the statute in all its applications,\nthey bear a heavy burden of persuasion. Only a few weeks\nago we held that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit had failed to give appropriate weight to the magni-\ntude of that burden when it sustained a preelection, facial\nattack on a Washington statute regulating that State\u2019s\nprimary election procedures.

It is, however,\ndifficult to understand why the State should require voters with a faith-\nbased objection to being photographed to cast provisional ballots subject\nto later verification in every election when the BMV is able to issue\nthese citizens special licenses that enable them to drive without any\nphoto identification.

Petition-\ners urge us to ask whether the State\u2019s interests justify the\nburden imposed on voters who cannot afford or obtain a\nbirth certificate and who must make a second trip to the\ncircuit court clerk\u2019s office after voting. But on the basis of\nthe evidence in the record it is not possible to quantify\neither the magnitude of the burden on this narrow class of\nvoters or the portion of the burden imposed on them that\nis fully justified.\n   First, the evidence in the record does not provide us\nwith the number of registered voters without photo identi-\nfication; Judge Barker found petitioners\u2019 expert\u2019s report to\nbe \u201cutterly incredible and unreliable.\u201d 458 F. Supp. 2d, at\n803. Much of the argument about the numbers of such\nvoters comes from extrarecord, postjudgment studies, the\naccuracy of which has not been tested in the trial court.\n   Further, the deposition evidence presented in the Dis-\ntrict Court does not provide any concrete evidence of the\nburden imposed on voters who currently lack photo identi-\nfication. The record includes depositions of two case man-\nagers at a day shelter for homeless persons and the depo-\nsitions of members of the plaintiff organizations, none of\nwhom expressed a personal inability to vote under SEA\n483. A deposition from a named plaintiff describes the\ndifficulty the elderly woman had in obtaining an identifi-\ncation card, although her testimony indicated that she\nintended to return to the BMV since she had recently\nobtained her birth certificate and that she was able to pay\nthe birth certificate fee. App. 94.\n   Judge Barker\u2019s opinion makes reference to six other\nelderly named plaintiffs who do not have photo identifica-\ntions, but several of these individuals have birth certifi-\n18       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ncates or were born in Indiana and have not indicated how\ndifficult it would be for them to obtain a birth certificate.\n458 F. Supp. 2d, at 797\u2013799. One elderly named plaintiff\nstated that she had attempted to obtain a birth certificate\nfrom Tennessee, but had not been successful, and another\ntestified that he did not know how to obtain a birth certifi-\ncate from North Carolina. The elderly in Indiana, how-\never, may have an easier time obtaining a photo identifi-\ncation card than the nonelderly, see n. 17, supra, and\nalthough it may not be a completely acceptable alterna-\ntive, the elderly in Indiana are able to vote absentee with-\nout presenting photo identification.\n   The record says virtually nothing about the difficulties\nfaced by either indigent voters or voters with religious\nobjections to being photographed. While one elderly man\nstated that he did not have the money to pay for a birth\ncertificate, when asked if he did not have the money or did\nnot wish to spend it, he replied, \u201cboth.\u201d App. 211\u2013212.\nFrom this limited evidence we do not know the magnitude\nof the impact SEA 483 will have on indigent voters in\nIndiana. The record does contain the affidavit of one\nhomeless woman who has a copy of her birth certificate,\nbut was denied a photo identification card because she did\nnot have an address. Id., at 67. But that single affidavit\ngives no indication of how common the problem is.\n   In sum, on the basis of the record that has been made in\nthis litigation, we cannot conclude that the statute im-\nposes \u201cexcessively burdensome requirements\u201d on any class\nof voters. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 738 (1974).20\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 Three comments on JUSTICE SOUTER\u2019s speculation about the non-\n\ntrivial burdens that SEA 483 may impose on \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of\nIndiana citizens, post, at 1 (dissenting opinion), are appropriate. First,\nthe fact that the District Judge estimated that when the statute was\npassed in 2005, 43,000 citizens did not have photo identification, see\n458 F. Supp. 2d 775, 807 (SD Ind. 2006), tells us nothing about the\nnumber of free photo identification cards issued since then. Second, the\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

S., at ___ (quoting Washington v. Glucksberg, 521\nU. S. 702, 739\u2013740, and n. 7 (1997) (STEVENS, J., concur-\nring in judgments)). When we consider only the statute\u2019s\nbroad application to all Indiana voters we conclude that it\n\u201cimposes only a limited burden on voters\u2019 rights.\u201d Bur-\ndick, 504 U. S., at 439. The \u201c \u2018precise interests\u2019 \u201d advanced\nby the State are therefore sufficient to defeat petitioners\u2019\nfacial challenge to SEA 483. Id., at 434.\n   Finally we note that petitioners have not demonstrated\nthat the proper remedy\u2014even assuming an unjustified\nburden on some voters\u2014would be to invalidate the entire\nstatute. When evaluating a neutral, nondiscriminatory\nregulation of voting procedure, \u201c[w]e must keep in mind\nthat \u201c \u2018[a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the in-\ntent of the elected representatives of the people.\u2019 \u201d Ayotte\nv. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfact that public transportation is not available in some Indiana counties\ntells us nothing about how often elderly and indigent citizens have an\nopportunity to obtain a photo identification at the BMV, either during a\nroutine outing with family or friends or during a special visit to the\nBMV arranged by a civic or political group such as the League of\nWomen Voters or a political party. Further, nothing in the record\nestablishes the distribution of voters who lack photo identification. To\nthe extent that the evidence sheds any light on that issue, it suggests\nthat such voters reside primarily in metropolitan areas, which are\nserved by public transportation in Indiana (the majority of the plain-\ntiffs reside in Indianapolis and several of the organizational plaintiffs\nare Indianapolis organizations). Third, the indigent, elderly, or dis-\nabled need not \u201cjourney all the way to their county seat each time they\nwish to exercise the franchise,\u201d post, at 29, if they obtain a free photo\nidentification card from the BMV. While it is true that obtaining a\nbirth certificate carries with it a financial cost, the record does not\nprovide even a rough estimate of how many indigent voters lack copies\nof their birth certificates. Supposition based on extensive Internet\nresearch is not an adequate substitute for admissible evidence subject\nto cross-examination in constitutional adjudication.\n20       CRAWFORD v.

Supp. 2d, at 783. It is fair to infer\nthat partisan considerations may have played a significant\nrole in the decision to enact SEA 483. If such considera-\ntions had provided the only justification for a photo identi-\nfication requirement, we may also assume that SEA 483\nwould suffer the same fate as the poll tax at issue in\nHarper.\n   But if a nondiscriminatory law is supported by valid\nneutral justifications, those justifications should not be\ndisregarded simply because partisan interests may have\nprovided one motivation for the votes of individual legisla-\ntors. The state interests identified as justifications for\nSEA 483 are both neutral and sufficiently strong to re-\nquire us to reject petitioners\u2019 facial attack on the statute.\nThe application of the statute to the vast majority of Indi-\nana voters is amply justified by the valid interest in pro-\ntecting \u201cthe integrity and reliability of the electoral proc-\ness.\u201d Anderson, 460 U.

That is true enough, but for the sake of\nclarity and finality (as well as adherence to precedent), I\nprefer to decide these cases on the grounds that petition-\ners\u2019 premise is irrelevant and that the burden at issue is\nminimal and justified.\n   To evaluate a law respecting the right to vote\u2014whether\nit governs voter qualifications, candidate selection, or the\nvoting process\u2014we use the approach set out in Burdick v.\nTakushi, 504 U. S. 428 (1992). This calls for application of\na deferential \u201cimportant regulatory interests\u201d standard for\nnonsevere, nondiscriminatory restrictions, reserving strict\n2       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nscrutiny for laws that severely restrict the right to vote.\nId., at 433\u2013434 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nlead opinion resists the import of Burdick by characteriz-\ning it as simply adopting \u201cthe balancing approach\u201d of\nAnderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780 (1983) (majority\nopinion of STEVENS, J.). See ante, at 6; see also ante, at 6\u2013\n7, n. 8. Although Burdick liberally quoted Anderson,\nBurdick forged Anderson\u2019s amorphous \u201cflexible standard\u201d\ninto something resembling an administrable rule. See\nBurdick, supra, at 434. Since Burdick, we have repeatedly\nreaffirmed the primacy of its two-track approach. See\nTimmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351,\n358 (1997); Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S. 581, 586\u2013587\n(2005). \u201c[S]trict scrutiny is appropriate only if the burden\nis severe.\u201d Id., at 592. Thus, the first step is to decide\nwhether a challenged law severely burdens the right to\nvote. Ordinary and widespread burdens, such as those\nrequiring \u201cnominal effort\u201d of everyone, are not severe. See\nid., at 591, 593\u2013597. Burdens are severe if they go beyond\nthe merely inconvenient. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S.\n724, 728\u2013729 (1974) (characterizing the law in Williams v.\nRhodes, 393 U. S. 23 (1968), as \u201csevere\u201d because it was \u201cso\nburdensome\u201d as to be \u201c \u2018virtually impossible\u2019 \u201d to satisfy).\n  Of course, we have to identify a burden before we can\nweigh it. The Indiana law affects different voters differ-\nently, ante, at 14\u201316, but what petitioners view as the\nlaw\u2019s several light and heavy burdens are no more than\nthe different impacts of the single burden that the law\nuniformly imposes on all voters. To vote in person in\nIndiana, everyone must have and present a photo identifi-\ncation that can be obtained for free. The State draws no\nclassifications, let alone discriminatory ones, except to\nestablish optional absentee and provisional balloting for\ncertain poor, elderly, and institutionalized voters and for\nreligious objectors. Nor are voters who already have photo\nidentifications exempted from the burden, since those\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nvoters must maintain the accuracy of the information\ndisplayed on the identifications, renew them before they\nexpire, and replace them if they are lost.\n   The Indiana photo-identification law is a generally\napplicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation, and our\nprecedents refute the view that individual impacts are\nrelevant to determining the severity of the burden it im-\nposes. In the course of concluding that the Hawaii laws at\nissue in Burdick \u201cimpose[d] only a limited burden on\nvoters\u2019 rights to make free choices and to associate politi-\ncally through the vote,\u201d 504 U. S., at 439, we considered\nthe laws and their reasonably foreseeable effect on voters\ngenerally. See id., at 436\u2013437. We did not discuss\nwhether the laws had a severe effect on Mr. Burdick\u2019s own\nright to vote, given his particular circumstances. That\nwas essentially the approach of the Burdick dissenters,\nwho would have applied strict scrutiny to the laws because\nof their effect on \u201csome voters.\u201d See id., at 446 (KENNEDY,\nJ., dissenting); see also id., at 448 (\u201cThe majority\u2019s analy-\nsis ignores the inevitable and significant burden a write-in\nban imposes upon some individual voters . . . .\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). Subsequent cases have followed Burdick\u2019s gener-\nalized review of nondiscriminatory election laws. See, e.g.,\nTimmons, supra, at 361\u2013362; Clingman, supra, at 590\u2013\n591, 592\u2013593. Indeed, Clingman\u2019s holding that burdens\nare not severe if they are ordinary and widespread would\nbe rendered meaningless if a single plaintiff could claim a\nsevere burden.\n   Not all of our decisions predating Burdick addressed\nwhether a challenged voting regulation severely burdened\nthe right to vote, but when we began to grapple with the\nmagnitude of burdens, we did so categorically and did not\nconsider the peculiar circumstances of individual voters or\ncandidates. See, e.g., Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431,\n438\u2013441 (1971). Thus, in Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U. S.\n752 (1973), we did not link the State\u2019s interest in inhibit-\n4        CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ning party raiding with the petitioners\u2019 own circumstances.\nSee id., at 760\u2013762. And in Storer v. Brown, supra, we\nobserved that the severity of the burden of a regulation\nshould be measured according to its \u201cnature, extent, and\nlikely impact.\u201d Id., at 738 (emphasis added). We therefore\ninstructed the District Court to decide on remand whether\n\u201ca reasonably diligent independent candidate [could] be\nexpected to satisfy the signature requirements, or will it\nbe only rarely that the unaffiliated candidate will succeed\nin getting on the ballot?\u201d Id., at 742 (emphasis added).\nNotably, we did not suggest that the District Court should\nconsider whether one of the petitioners would actually find\nit more difficult than a reasonably diligent candidate to\nobtain the required signatures. What mattered was the\ngeneral assessment of the burden.\n   Insofar as our election-regulation cases rest upon the\nrequirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Ander-\nson, supra, at 786, n. 7, weighing the burden of a nondis-\ncriminatory voting law upon each voter and concomitantly\nrequiring exceptions for vulnerable voters would effec-\ntively turn back decades of equal-protection jurisprudence.\nA voter complaining about such a law\u2019s effect on him has\nno valid equal-protection claim because, without proof of\ndiscriminatory intent, a generally applicable law with\ndisparate impact is not unconstitutional. See, e.g., Wash-\nington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 248 (1976). The Fourteenth\nAmendment does not regard neutral laws as invidious\nones, even when their burdens purportedly fall dispropor-\ntionately on a protected class. A fortiori it does not do so\nwhen, as here, the classes complaining of disparate impact\nare not even protected.* See Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * A number of our early right-to-vote decisions, purporting to rely\nupon the Equal Protection Clause, strictly scrutinized nondiscrimina-\ntory voting laws requiring the payment of fees. See, e.g., Harper v.\nVirginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663, 670 (1966) (poll tax); Bullock v.\nCarter, 405 U. S. 134, 145 (1972) (ballot-access fee); Lubin v.

This is an area where the dos and\ndon\u2019ts need to be known in advance of the election, and\nvoter-by-voter examination of the burdens of voting regu-\nlations would prove especially disruptive. A case-by-case\napproach naturally encourages constant litigation. Very\nfew new election regulations improve everyone\u2019s lot, so the\npotential allegations of severe burden are endless. A State\nreducing the number of polling places would be open to the\ncomplaint it has violated the rights of disabled voters who\nlive near the closed stations. Indeed, it may even be the\ncase that some laws already on the books are especially\nburdensome for some voters, and one can predict lawsuits\ndemanding that a State adopt voting over the Internet or\nexpand absentee balloting.\n   That sort of detailed judicial supervision of the election\nprocess would flout the Constitution\u2019s express commit-\nment of the task to the States. See Art. I, \u00a74.

See Burdick,\nsupra, at 433 (\u201cIt is beyond cavil that \u2018voting is of the most\nfundamental significance under our constitutional struc-\nture\u2019 \u201d (quoting Illinois Bd. of Elections v.

See Reynolds,\nsupra, at 562 (\u201cEspecially since the right to exercise the\nfranchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative\nof other basic civil and political rights, any alleged in-\nfringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully\nand meticulously scrutinized\u201d).\n   As against the unfettered right, however, lies the\n\u201c[c]ommon sense, as well as constitutional law . . . that\ngovernment must play an active role in structuring elec-\ntions; \u2018as a practical matter, there must be a substantial\nregulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest and\nif some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany\nthe democratic processes.\u2019 \u201d Burdick, supra, at 433 (quot-\ning Storer v.

See Indiana Democratic Party\nv. Rokita, 458 F. Supp. 2d 775, 791 (SD Ind. 2006). The\nneed to travel to a BMV branch will affect voters according\nto their circumstances, with the average person probably\nviewing it as nothing more than an inconvenience. Poor,\nold, and disabled voters who do not drive a car, however,\nmay find the trip prohibitive,4 witness the fact that the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Under Indiana\u2019s law, an ID does not qualify as proof of identification\n\nunless it \u201csatisfies all [of] the following\u201d:\n  \u201c(1) The document shows the name of the individual to whom the\ndocument was issued, and the name conforms to the name in the\nindividual\u2019s voter registration record.\n  \u201c(2) The document shows a photograph of the individual to whom the\ndocument was issued.\n  \u201c(3) The document includes an expiration date, and the document:\n  \u201c(A) is not expired; or\n  \u201c(B) expired after the date of the most recent general election.\n  \u201c(4) The document was issued by the United States or the state of\nIndiana.\u201d Ind.

See Brief for Respondents in No. 07\u2013\n25, p. 41. But as petitioners\u2019 amici AARP and the National Senior\nCitizens Law Center point out, there are crucial differences between\nthe absentee and regular ballot. Brief for AARP et al. as Amici Curiae\n12\u201316. Voting by absentee ballot leaves an individual without the\npossibility of receiving assistance from poll workers, and thus increases\nthe likelihood of confusion and error. More seriously, as the Supreme\nCourt of Indiana has recognized, Indiana law \u201ctreats absentee voters\ndifferently from the way it treats Election Day voters,\u201d in the important\nsense that \u201can absentee ballot may not be recounted in situations\nwhere clerical error by an election officer rendered it invalid.\u201d Horse-\nman v.

It translates into an obvious\neconomic cost (whether in work time lost, or getting and\npaying for transportation) that an Indiana voter must bear\nto obtain an ID.\n   For those voters who can afford the roundtrip, a second\nfinancial hurdle appears: in order to get photo identifica-\ntion for the first time, they need to present \u201c \u2018a birth cer-\ntificate, a certificate of naturalization, U. S. veterans\nphoto identification, U. S. military photo identification, or\na U. S. passport.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 14, n. 16 (lead opinion) (quot-\ning Ind. Admin.

As the lead\nopinion says, the two most common of these documents\ncome at a price: Indiana counties charge anywhere from\n$3 to $12 for a birth certificate (and in some other States\nthe fee is significantly higher), see ante, at 14, n. 16, and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe discrepancy appears to arise, in part, from the fact that the Ameri-\ncan Public Transportation Association has not counted demand re-\nsponse systems that have been established in at least 6 of these 13\ncounties.

MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                          SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthat same price must usually be paid for a first-time pass-\nport, since a birth certificate is required to prove U. S.\ncitizenship by birth. The total fees for a passport, more-\nover, are up to about $100.17 So most voters must pay at\nleast one fee to get the ID necessary to cast a regular\nballot.18 As with the travel costs, these fees are far from\nshocking on their face, but in the Burdick analysis it\nmatters that both the travel costs and the fees are dispro-\nportionately heavy for, and thus disproportionately likely\nto deter, the poor, the old, and the immobile.\n                              B\n   To be sure, Indiana has a provisional-ballot exception to\nthe ID requirement for individuals the State considers\n\u201cindigent\u201d19 as well as those with religious objections to\nbeing photographed, see ante, at 15 (lead opinion), and\nthis sort of exception could in theory provide a way around\nthe costs of procuring an ID. But Indiana\u2019s chosen excep-\ntion does not amount to much relief.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 See Department of State, How to Apply in Person for a Passport,\n\nhttp://travel.state.gov/passport/get/first/first_830.html; Department of\nState, Passport Fees (Feb. 1, 2008), http://travel.state.gov/passport/\nget/fees/fees_837.html (total fees of $100 for a passport book and $45 for\na passport card for individuals 16 and older).\n  18 The lead opinion notes that \u201cthe record does not provide even a\n\nrough estimate of how many indigent voters lack copies of their birth\ncertificates.\u201d Ante, at 19, n. 20. But the record discloses no reason to\nthink that any appreciable number of poor voters would need birth\ncertificates absent the Voter ID Law, and no reason to believe that poor\npeople would spend money to get them if they did not need them.\n  19 To vote by provisional ballot, an individual must (at the circuit\n\ncourt clerk\u2019s office) sign an affidavit affirming that she is \u201cindigent\u201d and\n\u201cunable to obtain proof of identification without payment of a fee.\u201d Ind.\nCode Ann. \u00a73\u201311.7\u20135\u20132.5(c)(2)(A). Indiana law does not define the key\nterms \u201cindigent\u201d or \u201cunable,\u201d but I will assume for present purposes\nthat the Indiana Supreme Court will eventually construe these terms\nbroadly, so that the income threshold for indigency is at least at the\nfederal poverty level, and so that the exception covers even individuals\nwho are facing only short-term financial difficulties.\n                      Cite as: 553 U.

See 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 786 (citing Ind. Code Ann. \u00a73\u201311\u20138\u201325.1\n(West Supp. 2007)). As the lead opinion recognizes,\nthough, ante, at 15, that is only the first step; to have the\nprovisional ballot counted, a voter must then appear in\nperson before the circuit court clerk or county election\nboard within 10 days of the election, to sign an affidavit\nattesting to indigency or religious objection to being pho-\ntographed (or to present an ID at that point),20 see 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 786. Unlike the trip to the BMV (which,\nassuming things go smoothly, needs to be made only once\nevery four years for renewal of nondriver photo identifica-\ntion, see id.), this one must be taken every time a poor\nperson or religious objector wishes to vote, because the\nState does not allow an affidavit to count in successive\nelections. And unlike the trip to the BMV (which at least\nhas a handful of license branches in the more populous\ncounties), a county has only one county seat. Forcing\nthese people to travel to the county seat every time they\ntry to vote is particularly onerous for the reason noted\nalready, that most counties in Indiana either lack public\ntransportation or offer only limited coverage. See supra,\nat 6\u20137.\n   That the need to travel to the county seat each election\namounts to a high hurdle is shown in the results of the\n2007 municipal elections in Marion County, to which\nIndiana\u2019s Voter ID Law applied. Thirty-four provisional\nballots were cast, but only two provisional voters made it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  20 Indiana law allows voters to cast a provisional ballot at the county\n\nclerk\u2019s office starting 29 days prior to election day until noon of the day\nprior to election day, see Ind. Code Ann. \u00a73\u201311.7\u20135\u20132.5, and this might\nenable some voters to make only one burdensome trip to the county\nseat. But for the voters who show up at the polls to vote and are there\ntold that they lack the photo identification needed to cast a regular\nballot, the Voter ID Law effectively forces them to make two trips.\n10       CRAWFORD v.

All 34 of these\naspiring voters appeared at the appropriate precinct; 33 of\nthem provided a signature, and every signature matched\nthe one on file; and 26 of the 32 voters whose ballots were\nnot counted had a history of voting in Marion County\nelections. See id., at 9.\n   All of this suggests that provisional ballots do not obvi-\nate the burdens of getting photo identification. And even\nif that were not so, the provisional-ballot option would be\ninadequate for a further reason: the indigency exception\nby definition offers no relief to those voters who do not\nconsider themselves (or would not be considered) indigent\nbut as a practical matter would find it hard, for nonfinan-\ncial reasons, to get the required ID (most obviously the\ndisabled).\n                             C\n  Indiana\u2019s Voter ID Law thus threatens to impose serious\nburdens on the voting right, even if not \u201csevere\u201d ones, and\nthe next question under Burdick is whether the number of\nindividuals likely to be affected is significant as well.\nRecord evidence and facts open to judicial notice answer\nyes.\n  Although the District Court found that petitioners failed\nto offer any reliable empirical study of numbers of voters\naffected, see ante, at 17 (lead opinion),21 we may accept\nthat court\u2019s rough calculation that 43,000 voting-age\nresidents lack the kind of identification card required by\nIndiana\u2019s law.

First, the District Court\nnoted that BMV records do not cover all forms of identification that\nmay be used to vote under the Voter ID Law (e.g., federal photo identi-\nfication, such as a passport). This is a valid consideration, but is\nunlikely to overcome the additions that must be made for the various\nfactors listed above. Second, the court noted that the BMV records do\nnot account for the exceptions to the photo identification requirement\n(such as the indigency and absentee-ballot exceptions). This factor does\nnot warrant a deduction of the 43,000 number because, as I have\nargued, the indigency exception imposes serious burdens of its own, see\nsupra, at 8\u201310, and the absentee-ballot exception is not a wholly\nadequate substitute for voting in person, see n. 4, supra.

To be sure, the 43,000 figure has to be dis-\ncounted to some extent, residents of certain nursing homes\nbeing exempted from the photo identification requirement.\n458 F. Supp. 2d, at 786.

A large\nproportion of them are likely to be in bad shape economi-\ncally, see 472 F. 3d 949, 951 (CA7 2007) (\u201cNo doubt most\npeople who don\u2019t have photo ID are low on the economic\nladder\u201d); cf. Bullock v. Carter, 405 U. S. 134, 144 (1972)\n(\u201c[W]e would ignore reality were we not to recognize that\nthis system falls with unequal weight on voters . . . accord-\ning to their economic status\u201d).25 The Voter ID Law places\nhurdles in the way of either getting an ID or of voting\nprovisionally, and they translate into nontrivial economic\ncosts. There is accordingly no reason to doubt that a sig-\nnificant number of state residents will be discouraged or\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nestimate to exclude citizens who are not registered to vote, or who are\nregistered but not planning to vote. See Brief for Respondents in No.\n07\u201325, p. 25; see also ante, at 17 (lead opinion) (\u201c[T]he evidence in the\nrecord does not provide us with the number of registered voters without\nphoto identification\u201d). But that argument is flatly contradicted by this\nCourt\u2019s settled precedent. As our cases have recognized, disfranchise-\nment is disfranchisement, whether or not the disfranchised voter would\nhave voted if given the choice. That is why in Dunn v. Blumstein, 405\nU. S. 330 (1972), the Court did not ask whether any significant number\nof individuals deprived of the right to vote by durational residence\nrequirements would actually have chosen to vote. And in Harper v.\nVirginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663 (1966), the Court did not pause\nto consider whether any of the qualified voters deterred by the $1.50\npoll tax would have opted to vote if there had been no fee. Our cases\nmake clear that the Constitution protects an individual\u2019s ability to vote,\nnot merely his decision to do so.\n  25 Studies in other States suggest that the burdens of an ID require-\n\nment may also fall disproportionately upon racial minorities. See\nOverton, Voter Identification, 105 Mich. L. Rev. 631, 659 (2007) (\u201cIn\n1994, the U. S. Department of Justice found that African-Americans in\nLouisiana were four to five times less likely than white residents to\nhave government-sanctioned photo identification\u201d); id., at 659\u2013660\n(describing June 2005 study by the Employment and Training Institute\nat the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, which found that while 17%\nof voting-age whites lacked a valid driver\u2019s license, 55% of black males\nand 49% of black females were unlicensed, and 46% of Latino males\nand 59% of Latino females were similarly unlicensed).\n14       CRAWFORD v.

S.\n330, 335, n. 5 (1972) (\u201c[I]t would be difficult to determine\nprecisely how many would-be voters throughout the coun-\ntry cannot vote because of durational residence require-\nments\u201d); Bullock, supra, at 144 (taking account of \u201cthe\nobvious likelihood\u201d that candidate filing fees would \u201cfall\nmore heavily on the less affluent segment of the commu-\nnity, whose favorites may be unable to pay the large\ncosts\u201d). While of course it would greatly aid a plaintiff to\nestablish his claims beyond mathematical doubt, he does\nenough to show that serious burdens are likely.\n   Thus, petitioners\u2019 case is clearly strong enough to\nprompt more than a cursory examination of the State\u2019s\nasserted interests.

Only one other State, Georgia, currently\nrestricts voters to the narrow forms of government-issued photo identi-\nfication. See Ga. Code Ann. \u00a721\u20132\u2013417 (Supp. 2007).

But\nhaving found the Voter ID Law burdens far from trivial, I\nhave to make a rigorous assessment of \u201c \u2018the precise inter-\nests put forward by the State as justifications for the\nburden imposed by its rule,\u2019 [and] \u2018the extent to which\nthose interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff\u2019s\nrights.\u2019 \u201d Burdick, 504 U.

And even if the State can show\nparticularized interests addressed by the law, those inter-\nests are subject to further discount depending on \u201cthe\nextent to which [they] make it necessary to burden the\nplaintiff\u2019s rights.\u201d Burdick, supra, at 434 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   As the lead opinion sees it, the State has offered four\nrelated concerns that suffice to justify the Voter ID Law:\nmodernizing election procedures, combating voter fraud,\naddressing the consequences of the State\u2019s bloated voter\nrolls, and protecting public confidence in the integrity of\nthe electoral process. See ante, at 7\u201313. On closer look,\nhowever, it appears that the first two (which are really\njust one) can claim modest weight at best, and the latter\ntwo if anything weaken the State\u2019s case.\n                              A\n  The lead opinion\u2019s discussion of the State\u2019s reasons\nbegins with the State\u2019s asserted interests in \u201celection\nmodernization,\u201d ante, at 8\u201310, and in combating voter\nfraud, see ante, at 11\u201313. Although these are given sepa-\nrate headings, any line drawn between them is unconvinc-\ning; as I understand it, the \u201ceffort to modernize elections,\u201d\nBrief for Respondents in No. 07\u201325, p. 12, is not for mod-\nernity\u2019s sake, but to reach certain practical (or political)\nobjectives.27 In any event, if a proposed modernization\nwere in fact aimless, if it were put forward as change for\nchange\u2019s sake, a State could not justify any appreciable\nburden on the right to vote that might ensue; useless\ntechnology has no constitutional value. And in fact that is\nnot the case here. The State says that it adopted the ID\nlaw principally to combat voter fraud, and it is this claim,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  27 See generally R.

See Purcell, 549\nU. S., at 4 (acknowledging \u201cthe State\u2019s compelling interest\nin preventing voter fraud\u201d); cf. Eu v. San Francisco County\nDemocratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 231 (1989) (\u201cA\nState indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving\nthe integrity of its election process\u201d). But it takes several\nsteps to get beyond the level of abstraction here.\n   To begin with, requiring a voter to show photo identifi-\ncation before casting a regular ballot addresses only one\nform of voter fraud: in-person voter impersonation. The\nphoto ID requirement leaves untouched the problems of\nabsentee-ballot fraud, which (unlike in-person voter im-\npersonation) is a documented problem in Indiana, see 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 793; of registered voters voting more than\nonce (but maintaining their own identities) in different\ncounties or in different States; of felons and other disquali-\nfied individuals voting in their own names; of vote buying;\nor, for that matter, of ballot-stuffing, ballot miscounting,\nvoter intimidation, or any other type of corruption on the\npart of officials administering elections. See Brief for\nBrennan Center for Justice et al. as Amici Curiae 7.\n   And even the State\u2019s interest in deterring a voter from\nshowing up at the polls and claiming to be someone he is\nnot must, in turn, be discounted for the fact that the State\nhas not come across a single instance of in-person voter\nimpersonation fraud in all of Indiana\u2019s history. See 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 792\u2013793; see also ante, at 11\u201313 (lead\nopinion). Neither the District Court nor the Indiana Gen-\neral Assembly that passed the Voter ID Law was given\nany evidence whatsoever of in-person voter impersonation\nfraud in the State. See 458 F.

Ibid. It is also consistent with\nthe dearth of evidence of in-person voter impersonation in\nany other part of the country. See ante, at 11, n. 11 (lead\nopinion) (conceding that there are at most \u201cscattered\ninstances of in-person voter fraud\u201d); see also Brief for\nBrennan Center for Justice, supra, at 11\u201325, 25 (demon-\nstrating that \u201cthe national evidence\u2014including the very\nevidence relied on by the courts below\u2014suggests that the\ntype of voting fraud that may be remedied by a photo ID\nrequirement is virtually nonexistent: the \u2018problem\u2019 of voter\nimpersonation is not a real problem at all\u201d).28\n   The State responds to the want of evidence with the\nassertion that in-person voter impersonation fraud is hard\nto detect. But this is like saying the \u201cman who wasn\u2019t\nthere\u201d is hard to spot,29 and to know whether difficulty in\ndetection accounts for the lack of evidence one at least has\nto ask whether in-person voter impersonation is (or would\nbe) relatively harder to ferret out than other kinds of fraud\n(e.g., by absentee ballot) which the State has had no trou-\nble documenting.

See Brief for Respondents\nin No. 07\u201321, p. 6 (\u201c[P]recinct workers may recognize an\nimposter, and precinct election workers have the authority\nto challenge persons appearing to vote if the election board\nmember \u2018is not satisfied that a person who offers to vote is\nthe person who the person represents the person to be\u2019 \u201d\n(quoting Ind. Code Ann. \u00a73\u201311\u20138\u201327 (West 2006))).\n  The relative ease of discovering in-person voter imper-\nsonation is also owing to the odds that any such fraud will\nbe committed by \u201corganized groups such as campaigns or\npolitical parties\u201d rather than by individuals acting alone.\nL. Minnite & D. Callahan, Securing the Vote: An Analysis\nof Election Fraud 14 (2003). It simply is not worth it for\nindividuals acting alone to commit in-person voter imper-\nsonation, which is relatively ineffectual for the foolish few\nwho may commit it. If an imposter gets caught, he is\nsubject to severe criminal penalties. See, e.g., Ind. Code\nAnn. \u00a73\u201314\u20132\u20139 (making it a felony \u201cknowingly [to] vot[e]\nor offe[r] to vote at an election when the person is not\nregistered or authorized to vote\u201d); \u00a73\u201314\u20132\u201311 (with cer-\ntain exceptions, \u201ca person who knowingly votes or offers to\nvote in a precinct except the one in which the person is\nregistered and resides\u201d commits a felony); \u00a73\u201314\u20132\u201312(1)\n(making it a felony \u201cknowingly [to] vot[e] or mak[e] appli-\ncation to vote in an election in a name other than the\nperson\u2019s own\u201d); \u00a73\u201314\u20132\u201312(2) (a person who, \u201chaving\nvoted once at an election, knowingly applies to vote at the\nsame election in the person\u2019s own name or any other\nname\u201d commits a felony); see also 42 U.

And even\nif he succeeds, the imposter gains nothing more than one\nadditional vote for his candidate. See EAC Report 9 (in-\nperson voter impersonation \u201cis an inefficient method of\ninfluencing an election\u201d); J. Levitt, The Truth about Voter\nFraud 7 (2007) (\u201c[F]raud by individual voters is a singu-\nlarly foolish and ineffective way to attempt to win an\nelection. Each act of voter fraud in connection with a\nfederal election risks five years in prison and a $10,000\nfine, in addition to any state penalties. In return, it yields\nat most one incremental vote. That single extra vote is\nsimply not worth the price\u201d (footnote omitted)); cf. 472\nF. 3d, at 951 (\u201c[A] vote in a political election rarely has\nany instrumental value, since elections for political office\nat the state or federal level are never decided by just one\nvote\u201d (emphasis in original)).\n   In sum, fraud by individuals acting alone, however\ndifficult to detect, is unlikely. And while there may be\ngreater incentives for organized groups to engage in broad-\ngauged in-person voter impersonation fraud, see Minnite\n& Callahan, supra, at 20, it is also far more difficult to\nconceal larger enterprises of this sort. The State\u2019s argu-\nment about the difficulty of detecting the fraud lacks real\nforce.\n                              2\n   Nothing else the State has to say does much to bolster\nits case. The State argues, for example, that even without\nevidence of in-person voter impersonation in Indiana, it is\nenough for the State to show that \u201copportunities [for such\nfraud] are transparently obvious in elections without\nidentification checks,\u201d Brief for Respondents in No. 07\u201325,\np. 54. Of course they are, but Indiana elections before the\nVoter ID Law were not run \u201cwithout identification checks\u201d;\n22        CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                          SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\non the contrary, as the Marion County Election Board\ninforms us, \u201c[t]ime-tested systems were in place to detect\nin-person voter impersonation fraud before the challenged\nstatute was enacted,\u201d Brief for Respondents in No. 07\u201321,\np. 6. These included hiring poll workers who were pre-\ncinct residents familiar with the neighborhood, and mak-\ning signature comparisons, each effort being supported by\nthe criminal provisions mentioned before. Id., at 6\u20138.\n   For that matter, the deterrence argument can do only so\nmuch work, since photo identification is itself hardly a\nfailsafe against impersonation. Indiana knows this, and\nthat is why in 2007 the State began to issue redesigned\ndriver\u2019s licenses with digital watermarking.30 The State\nhas made this shift precisely because, in the words of its\nBMV, \u201cvisual inspection is not adequate to determine the\nauthenticity\u201d of driver\u2019s licenses. See Indiana BMV, su-\npra, n. 30. Indeed, the BMV explains that the digital\nwatermarks (which can be scanned using equipment that,\nso far, Indiana does not use at polling places) is needed to\n\u201ctak[e] the guesswork out of inspection.\u201d Ibid.31 So, at\nleast until polling places have the machines and special\nsoftware to scan the new driver\u2019s licenses, and until all the\nlicenses with the older designs expire (the licenses issued\nafter 2006 but before the 2007 redesigning are good until\n2012, see 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 791), Indiana\u2019s law does no\nmore than assure that any in-person voter fraud will take\nplace with fake IDs, not attempted signature forgery.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   30 See Indiana BMV, Digital Drivers License: Frequently Asked Ques-\n\ntions, \u201cWhat is a digital watermark and why is Indiana incorporating it\ninto their driver license?\u201d, http://www.in.gov/bmv/3382.htm.\n   31 In the words of Indiana\u2019s Governor, Mitch Daniels: \u201c \u2018Not very long\n\nago, Indiana driver\u2019s licenses were a late-night talk show joke [because\nof] the ease of their fraudulent issuance and also their duplication . . . .\n[The new design] will make particularly their duplication dramatically\nmore difficult.\u2019 \u201d Udell, Digital Driver\u2019s Licenses Designed To Stem ID\nTheft, Evansville Courier, June 7, 2007, p. B6.\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                    23\n\n                         SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\n   Despite all this, I will readily stipulate that a State has\nan interest in responding to the risk (however small) of in-\nperson voter impersonation. See ante, at 12 (lead opinion).\nI reach this conclusion, like others accepted by the Court,\nbecause \u201c \u2018[w]here a legislature has significantly greater\ninstitutional expertise, as, for example, in the field of\nelection regulation, the Court in practice defers to empiri-\ncal legislative judgments.\u2019 \u201d Randall, 548 U. S., at 285\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting) (quoting Nixon v. Shrink Missouri\nGovernment PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 402 (2000) (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring)). Weight is owed to the legislative judgment\nas such. But the ultimate valuation of the particular\ninterest a State asserts has to take account of evidence\nagainst it as well as legislative judgments for it (certainly\nwhen the law is one of the most restrictive of its kind, see\nn. 26, supra), and on this record it would be unreasonable\nto accord this assumed state interest more than very\nmodest significance.32\n                             3\n  The antifraud rationale is open to skepticism on one\nfurther ground, what Burdick spoke of as an assessment of\nthe degree of necessity for the State\u2019s particular course of\naction. Two points deserve attention, the first being that\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  32 On such flimsy evidence of fraud, it would also ignore the lessons of\n\nhistory to grant the State\u2019s interest more than modest weight, as the\ninterest in combating voter fraud has too often served as a cover for\nunnecessarily restrictive electoral rules. See F. Ogden, The Poll Tax in\nthe South 9 (1958) (\u201cIn Arkansas and Texas, the argument was fre-\nquently presented that a poll tax payment prerequisite would purify\nelections by preventing repeaters and floaters from voting\u201d); see also\nBrief for Historians and Other Scholars as Amici Curiae 4\u201315 (detailing\nabuses); R. Hayduk, Gatekeepers to the Franchise: Shaping Election\nAdministration in New York 36 (2005) (\u201cIn both historical and contem-\nporary contexts certain groups have had an interest in alleging fraud\nand thereby shaping electoral rules and practices in a restrictive\ndirection, and other groups have had an opposite interest\u201d).\n24      CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthe State has not even tried to justify its decision to im-\nplement the photo identification requirement immediately\non passage of the new law. A phase-in period would have\ngiven the State time to distribute its newly designed li-\ncenses, and to make a genuine effort to get them to indi-\nviduals in need, and a period for transition is exactly what\nthe Commission on Federal Election Reform, headed by\nformer President Carter and former Secretary of State\nBaker, recommended in its report. See Building Confi-\ndence in U. S. Elections \u00a72.5 (Sept. 2005), App. 136, 140\n(hereinafter Carter-Baker Report) (\u201cFor the next two\nfederal elections, until January 1, 2010, in states that\nrequire voters to present ID at the polls, voters who fail to\ndo so should nonetheless be allowed to cast a provisional\nballot, and their ballot would count if their signature is\nverified\u201d). During this phase-in period, the report said,\nStates would need to make \u201cefforts to ensure that all\nvoters are provided convenient opportunities to obtain\u201d the\nrequired identification. Id., at 141. The former President\nand former Secretary of State explained this recommenda-\ntion in an op-ed essay:\n        \u201cYes, we are concerned about the approximately 12\n     percent of citizens who lack a driver\u2019s license. So we\n     proposed that states finally assume the responsibility\n     to seek out citizens to both register voters and provide\n     them with free ID\u2019s that meet federal standards.\n     States should open new offices, use social service\n     agencies and deploy mobile offices to register voters.\n     By connecting ID\u2019s to registration, voting participa-\n     tion will be expanded.\u201d Carter & Baker, Voting Re-\n     form is in the Cards, N. Y. Times, Sept. 23, 2005, p.\n     A19.\nAlthough Indiana claims to have adopted its ID require-\nment relying partly on the Carter-Baker Report, see Brief\nfor Respondents in No. 07\u201325, pp. 5, 13, 49; see also ante,\n                    Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                 25\n\n                        SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nat 10 (lead opinion), the State conspicuously rejected the\nReport\u2019s phase-in recommendation aimed at reducing the\nburdens on the right to vote, and just as conspicuously\nfails even to try to explain why.\n   What is left of the State\u2019s claim must be downgraded\nfurther for one final reason: regardless of the interest the\nState may have in adopting a photo identification re-\nquirement as a general matter, that interest in no way\nnecessitates the particular burdens the Voter ID Law\nimposes on poor people and religious objectors. Individu-\nals unable to get photo identification are forced to travel to\nthe county seat every time they wish to exercise the fran-\nchise, and they have to get there within 10 days of the\nelection. See supra, at 8\u201310. Nothing about the State\u2019s\ninterest in fighting voter fraud justifies this requirement\nof a post-election trip to the county seat instead of some\nverification process at the polling places.\n   In briefing this Court, the State responds by pointing to\nan interest in keeping lines at polling places short. See\nBrief for Respondents in No. 07\u201325, p. 58. It warns that\n\u201c[i]f election workers\u2014a scarce resource in any election\u2014\nmust attend to the details of validating provisional ballots,\nvoters may have to wait longer to vote,\u201d and it assures us\nthat \u201c[n]othing deters voting so much as long lines at the\npolls.\u201d Ibid. But this argument fails on its own terms, for\nwhatever might be the number of individuals casting a\nprovisional ballot, the State could simply allow voters to\nsign the indigency affidavit at the polls subject to review\nthere after the election.33 After all, the Voter ID Law\nalready requires voters lacking photo identification to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  33 Florida has accommodated voters in this manner.      In Florida a\nvoter who casts a provisional ballot may have that vote counted if the\nvoter\u2019s signature on the provisional-ballot certification matches the\nsignature on the voter\u2019s registration. See Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7101.043,\n101.048. The voter is not required to make a second trip to have her\nprovisional ballot counted.\n26      CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nsign, at the polling site, an affidavit attesting to proper\nregistration. See 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 786.\n   Indeed, the State\u2019s argument more than fails; it back-\nfires, in implicitly conceding that a not-insignificant num-\nber of individuals will need to rely on the burdensome\nprovisional-ballot mechanism. What is more, as the Dis-\ntrict Court found, the Voter ID Law itself actually in-\ncreases the likelihood of delay at the polls. Since any\nminor discrepancy between a voter\u2019s photo identification\ncard and the registration information may lead to a chal-\nlenge, \u201cthe opportunities for presenting challenges ha[ve]\nincreased as a result of the photo identification require-\nments.\u201d Id., at 789; cf. 472 F. 3d, at 955 (Evans, J., dis-\nsenting) (\u201cThe potential for mischief with this law is obvi-\nous. Does the name on the ID \u2018conform\u2019 to the name on\nthe voter registration list? If the last name of a newly\nmarried woman is on the ID but her maiden name is on\nthe registration list, does it conform? If a name is mis-\nspelled on one\u2014Schmit versus Schmitt\u2014does it conform?\nIf a \u2018Terence\u2019 appears on one and a shortened \u2018Terry\u2019 on\nthe other, does it conform?\u201d).\n                               B\n   The State\u2019s asserted interests in modernizing elections\nand combating fraud are decidedly modest; at best, they\nfail to offset the clear inference that thousands of Indiana\ncitizens will be discouraged from voting. The two remain-\ning justifications, meanwhile, actually weaken the State\u2019s\ncase.\n   The lead opinion agrees with the State that \u201cthe infla-\ntion of its voter rolls is further support for its enactment\nof\u201d the Voter ID Law. Ante, at 12. This is a puzzling\nconclusion, given the fact, which the lead opinion notes,\nthat the National Government filed a complaint against\nIndiana, containing this allegation:\n     \u201cIndiana has failed to conduct a general program that\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

S. C.\n\u00a71973gg\u20136.\n   How any of this can justify restrictions on the right to\nvote is difficult to say. The State is simply trying to take\nadvantage of its own wrong: if it is true that the State\u2019s\nfear of in-person voter impersonation fraud arises from its\nbloated voter checklist, the answer to the problem is in the\nState\u2019s own hands. The claim that the State has an inter-\nest in addressing a symptom of the problem (alleged im-\npersonation) rather than the problem itself (the negli-\ngently maintained bloated rolls) is thus self-defeating; it\nshows that the State has no justifiable need to burden the\nright to vote as it does, and it suggests that the State is\nnot as serious about combating fraud as it claims to be.34\n   The State\u2019s final justification, its interest in safeguard-\ning voter confidence, similarly collapses. The problem\nwith claiming this interest lies in its connection to the\nbloated voter rolls; the State has come up with nothing to\nsuggest that its citizens doubt the integrity of the State\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  34 The voting-rolls argument also suggests that it would not be so\n\ndifficult to detect in-person voter fraud after all. If it is true that\npractitioners of fraud are most likely to vote in the name of registered\nvoters whom they know to have died or left the jurisdiction, then\nIndiana could simply audit its voting records to examine whether, and\nhow often, in-person votes were cast using these invalid registrations.\n28      CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nelectoral process, except its own failure to maintain its\nrolls. The answer to this problem is not to burden the\nright to vote, but to end the official negligence.\n   It should go without saying that none of this is to deny\nStates\u2019 legitimate interest in safeguarding public confi-\ndence. The Court has, for example, recognized that fight-\ning perceptions of political corruption stemming from large\npolitical contributions is a legitimate and substantial state\ninterest, underlying not only campaign finance laws, but\nbribery and antigratuity statutes as well. See Nixon v.\nShrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 390\n(2000). But the force of the interest depends on the facts\n(or plausibility of the assumptions) said to justify invoking\nit. See id., at 391 (\u201cThe quantum of empirical evidence\nneeded to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative\njudgments will vary up or down with the novelty and\nplausibility of the justification raised\u201d). While we found in\nNixon that \u201cthere is little reason to doubt that sometimes\nlarge contributions will work actual corruption of our\npolitical system, and no reason to question the existence of\na corresponding suspicion among voters,\u201d id., at 395, there\nis plenty of reason to be doubtful here, both about the\nreality and the perception. It is simply not plausible to\nassume here, with no evidence of in-person voter imper-\nsonation fraud in a State, and very little of it nationwide,\nthat a public perception of such fraud is nevertheless\n\u201cinherent\u201d in an election system providing severe criminal\npenalties for fraud and mandating signature checks at the\npolls. Cf. id., at 390 (\u201c[T]he perception of corruption [is]\n\u2018inherent in a regime of large individual financial contri-\nbutions\u2019 to candidates for public office\u201d (quoting Buckley v.\nValeo, 424 U.

The State\nrecognizes that tens of thousands of qualified voters lack\nthe necessary federally issued or state-issued identifica-\ntion, but it insists on implementing the requirement im-\nmediately, without allowing a transition period for tar-\ngeted efforts to distribute the required identification to\nindividuals who need it. The State hardly even tries to\nexplain its decision to force indigents or religious objectors\nto travel all the way to their county seats every time they\nwish to vote, and if there is any waning of confidence in\nthe administration of elections it probably owes more to\nthe State\u2019s violation of federal election law than to any\nimposters at the polling places. It is impossible to say, on\nthis record, that the State\u2019s interest in adopting its sig-\nnally inhibiting photo identification requirement has been\nshown to outweigh the serious burdens it imposes on the\nright to vote.\n   If more were needed to condemn this law, our own\nprecedent would provide it, for the calculation revealed in\nthe Indiana statute crosses a line when it targets the poor\nand the weak. Cf. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780,\n793 (1983) (\u201c[I]t is especially difficult for the State to\njustify a restriction that limits political participation by an\nidentifiable political group whose members share a par-\nticular viewpoint, associational preference, or economic\nstatus\u201d). If the Court\u2019s decision in Harper v. Virginia Bd.\nof Elections, 383 U. S. 663 (1966), stands for anything, it is\nthat being poor has nothing to do with being qualified to\nvote. Harper made clear that \u201c[t]o introduce wealth or\npayment of a fee as a measure of a voter\u2019s qualifications is\nto introduce a capricious or irrelevant factor.\u201d Id., at 668.\nThe State\u2019s requirements here, that people without cars\ntravel to a motor vehicle registry and that the poor who\nfail to do that get to their county seats within 10 days of\nevery election, likewise translate into unjustified economic\n30      CRAWFORD v.

See Report of the Commission on Federal\nElection Reform, Building Confidence in U. S. Elections\n\u00a72.5 (Sept. 2005) (Carter-Baker Report), App. 136\u2013144.\nBecause the record does not discredit the Carter-Baker\nReport or suggest that Indiana is exceptional, I see noth-\ning to prevent Indiana\u2019s Legislature (or a federal court\nconsidering the constitutionality of the statute) from\ntaking account of the legislatively relevant facts the report\nsets forth and paying attention to its expert conclusions.\nThus, I share the general view of the lead opinion insofar\nas it holds that the Constitution does not automatically\nforbid Indiana from enacting a photo ID requirement.\nWere I also to believe, as JUSTICE STEVENS believes, that\nthe burden imposed by the Indiana statute on eligible\nvoters who lack photo IDs is indeterminate \u201con the basis of\nthe record that has been made in this litigation,\u201d ante, at\n18, or were I to believe, as JUSTICE SCALIA believes, that\nthe burden the statute imposes is \u201cminimal\u201d or \u201cjustified,\u201d\nante, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment), then I too\nwould reject the petitioners\u2019 facial attack, primarily for the\nreasons set forth in Part II of the lead opinion, see ante, at\n7\u201313.\n  I cannot agree, however, with JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 or\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s assessment of the burdens imposed by\nthe statute. The Carter-Baker Commission conditioned its\nrecommendation upon the States\u2019 willingness to ensure\nthat the requisite photo IDs \u201cbe easily available and is-\nsued free of charge\u201d and that the requirement be \u201cphased\nin\u201d over two federal election cycles, to ease the transition.\nCarter-Baker Report, at App. 139, 140.

See ante, at 6\u20137\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting) (noting that out of Indiana\u2019s 92\ncounties, 21 have no public transportation system at all\nand 32 others restrict public transportation to regional\ncounty service). For another, many of these individuals\nmay be uncertain about how to obtain the underlying\ndocumentation, usually a passport or a birth certificate,\nupon which the statute insists. And some may find the\ncosts associated with these documents unduly burdensome\n(up to $12 for a copy of a birth certificate; up to $100 for a\npassport). By way of comparison, this Court previously\nfound unconstitutionally burdensome a poll tax of $1.50\n(less than $10 today, inflation-adjusted). See Harper v.\nVirginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663, 664 n. 1, 666\n(1966); ante, at 30 (SOUTER, J., dissenting). Further,\nIndiana\u2019s exception for voters who cannot afford this cost\nimposes its own burden: a postelection trip to the county\nclerk or county election board to sign an indigency affida-\nvit after each election. See ante, at 8\u201310 (same).\n   By way of contrast, two other States\u2014Florida and Geor-\ngia\u2014have put into practice photo ID requirements signifi-\ncantly less restrictive than Indiana\u2019s. Under the Florida\nlaw, the range of permissible forms of photo ID is substan-\ntially greater than in Indiana. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7101.043(1)\n(West Supp. 2008) (including employee badge or ID, a\ndebit or credit card, a student ID, a retirement center ID,\na neighborhood association ID, and a public assistance\nID). Moreover, a Florida voter who lacks photo ID may\ncast a provisional ballot at the polling place that will be\n4       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncounted if the State determines that his signature\nmatches the one on his voter registration form.\n\u00a7\u00a7101.043(2); 101.048(2)(b).\n  Georgia restricts voters to a more limited list of accept-\nable photo IDs than does Florida, but accepts in addition\nto proof of voter registration a broader range of underlying\ndocumentation than does Indiana. See Ga. Code Ann.\n\u00a721\u20132\u2013417 (Supp. 2007); Ga. Comp. Rules & Regs., Rule\n183\u20131\u201320.01 (2008) (permissible underlying documents\ninclude a paycheck stub, Social Security, Medicare, or\nMedicaid statement, school transcript, or federal affidavit\nof birth, as long as the document includes the voter\u2019s full\nname and date of birth). Moreover, a Federal District\nCourt found that Georgia \u201chas undertaken a serious,\nconcerted effort to notify voters who may lack Photo ID\ncards of the Photo ID requirement, to inform those voters\nof the availability of free [State-issued] Photo ID cards or\nfree Voter ID cards, to instruct the voters concerning how\nto obtain the cards, and to advise the voters that they can\nvote absentee by mail without a Photo ID.\u201d Common\nCause/Georgia v. Billups, 504 F. Supp. 2d 1333, 1380 (ND\nGa. 2007). While Indiana allows only certain groups such\nas the elderly and disabled to vote by absentee ballot, in\nGeorgia any voter may vote absentee without providing\nany excuse, and (except where required by federal law)\nneed not present a photo ID in order to do so. Compare\nInd. Code \u00a73\u201311\u20134\u20131 (West 2006) with Ga. Code Ann.\n\u00a721\u20132\u2013381 (Supp. 2007). Finally, neither Georgia nor\nFlorida insists, as Indiana does, that indigent voters travel\neach election cycle to potentially distant places for the\npurposes of signing an indigency affidavit.\n  The record nowhere provides a convincing reason why\nIndiana\u2019s photo ID requirement must impose greater\nburdens than those of other States, or than the Carter-\nBaker Commission recommended nationwide. Nor is\nthere any reason to think that there are proportionately\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

See\n458 F. Supp. 2d 775, 807 (SD Ind. 2006). And I need not\ndetermine the constitutionality of Florida\u2019s or Georgia\u2019s\nrequirements (matters not before us), in order to conclude\nthat Indiana\u2019s requirement imposes a significantly\nharsher, unjustified burden.\n   Of course, the Carter-Baker Report is not the Constitu-\ntion of the United States. But its findings are highly\nrelevant to both legislative and judicial determinations of\nthe reasonableness of a photo ID requirement; to the\nrelated necessity of assuring that all those eligible to vote\npossess the requisite IDs; and to the presence of alterna-\ntive methods of assuring that possession, methods that are\nsuperior to those that Indiana\u2019s statute sets forth. The\nCommission\u2019s findings, taken together with the considera-\ntions set forth in Part II of JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion, and\nPart II of JUSTICE SOUTER\u2019s dissenting opinion, lead me to\nthe conclusion that while the Constitution does not in\ngeneral forbid Indiana from enacting a photo ID require-\nment, this statute imposes a disproportionate burden upon\nthose without valid photo IDs. For these reasons, I\ndissent.\n",

MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    288\u2013289. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) Each of Indiana\u2019s asserted interests is unquestionably relevant\n    to its interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the elec-\n    toral process. The first is the interest in deterring and detecting\n    voter fraud. Indiana has a valid interest in participating in a na-\n    tionwide effort to improve and modernize election procedures criti-\n    cized as antiquated and inefficient. Indiana also claims a particular\n    interest in preventing voter fraud in response to the problem of voter\n    registration rolls with a large number of names of persons who are\n    either deceased or no longer live in Indiana. While the record con-\n    tains no evidence that the fraud SEA 483 addresses\u2014in-person voter\n    impersonation at polling places\u2014has actually occurred in Indiana,\n    such fraud has occurred in other parts of the country, and Indiana\u2019s\n    own experience with voter fraud in a 2003 mayoral primary demon-\n    strates a real risk that voter fraud could affect a close election\u2019s out-\n    come. There is no question about the legitimacy or importance of a\n    State\u2019s interest in counting only eligible voters\u2019 votes. Finally, Indi-\n    ana\u2019s interest in protecting public confidence in elections, while\n    closely related to its interest in preventing voter fraud, has inde-\n    pendent significance, because such confidence encourages citizen par-\n    ticipation in the democratic process. Pp. 7\u201313.\n       (c) The relevant burdens here are those imposed on eligible voters\n    who lack photo identification cards that comply with SEA 483. Be-\n    cause Indiana\u2019s cards are free, the inconvenience of going to the Bu-\n    reau of Motor Vehicles, gathering required documents, and posing for\n    a photograph does not qualify as a substantial burden on most voters\u2019\n    right to vote, or represent a significant increase over the usual bur-\n    dens of voting. The severity of the somewhat heavier burden that\n    may be placed on a limited number of persons\u2014e.g., elderly persons\n    born out-of-state, who may have difficulty obtaining a birth certifi-\n    cate\u2014is mitigated by the fact that eligible voters without photo iden-\n    tification may cast provisional ballots that will be counted if they\n    execute the required affidavit at the circuit court clerk\u2019s office. Even\n    assuming that the burden may not be justified as to a few voters, that\n    conclusion is by no means sufficient to establish petitioners\u2019 right to\n    the relief they seek. Pp. 13\u201316.\n       (d) Petitioners bear a heavy burden of persuasion in seeking to in-\n    validate SEA 483 in all its applications. This Court\u2019s reasoning in\n    Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552\n    U. S. ___, applies with added force here. Petitioners argue that Indi-\n    ana\u2019s interests do not justify the burden imposed on voters who can-\n    not afford or obtain a birth certificate and who must make a second\n    trip to the circuit court clerk\u2019s office, but it is not possible to quantify,\n    based on the evidence in the record, either that burden\u2019s magnitude\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  or the portion of the burden that is fully justified. A facial challenge\n  must fail where the statute has a \u201c \u2018plainly legitimate sweep.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n  ___. When considering SEA 483\u2019s broad application to all Indiana\n  voters, it \u201cimposes only a limited burden on voters\u2019 rights.\u201d Burdick\n  v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 439. The \u201cprecise interests\u201d advanced by\n  Indiana are therefore sufficient to defeat petitioners\u2019 facial challenge.\n  Id., at 434. Pp. 16\u201320.\n     (e) Valid neutral justifications for a nondiscriminatory law, such as\n  SEA 483, should not be disregarded simply because partisan inter-\n  ests may have provided one motivation for the votes of individual leg-\n  islators. P. 20.\n     JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE ALITO, was\n  of the view that petitioners\u2019 premise that the voter-identification law\n  might have imposed a special burden on some voters is irrelevant.\n  The law should be upheld because its overall burden is minimal and\n  justified. A law respecting the right to vote should be evaluated un-\n  der the approach in Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, which calls for\n  application of a deferential, \u201cimportant regulatory interests\u201d stan-\n  dard for nonsevere, nondiscriminatory restrictions, reserving strict\n  scrutiny for laws that severely restrict the right to vote, id., at 433\u2013\n  434. The different ways in which Indiana\u2019s law affects different vot-\n  ers are no more than different impacts of the single burden that the\n  law uniformly imposes on all voters: To vote in person, everyone must\n  have and present a photo identification that can be obtained for free.\n  This is a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation.\n  The law\u2019s universally applicable requirements are eminently reason-\n  able because the burden of acquiring, possessing, and showing a free\n  photo identification is not a significant increase over the usual voting\n  burdens, and the State\u2019s stated interests are sufficient to sustain that\n  minimal burden.

The majority first held that the\nDemocrats had standing to bring a facial challenge to the\nconstitutionality of SEA 483. Next, noting the absence of\nany plaintiffs who claimed that the law would deter them\nfrom voting, the Court of Appeals inferred that \u201cthe moti-\nvation for the suit is simply that the law may require the\nDemocratic Party and the other organizational plaintiffs\nto work harder to get every last one of their supporters to\nthe polls.\u201d Id., at 952. It rejected the argument that the\nlaw should be judged by the same strict standard applica-\nble to a poll tax because the burden on voters was offset by\nthe benefit of reducing the risk of fraud. The dissenting\njudge, viewing the justification for the law as \u201chollow\u201d\u2014\nmore precisely as \u201ca not-too-thinly-veiled attempt to dis-\ncourage election-day turnout by certain folks believed to\nskew Democratic\u201d\u2014would have applied a stricter stan-\ndard, something he described as \u201cclose to \u2018strict scrutiny\nlight.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 954, 956 (opinion of Evans, J.).

Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663\n(1966), the Court held that Virginia could not condition\nthe right to vote in a state election on the payment of a\npoll tax of $1.50. We rejected the dissenters\u2019 argument\nthat the interest in promoting civic responsibility by weed-\ning out those voters who did not care enough about public\naffairs to pay a small sum for the privilege of voting pro-\nvided a rational basis for the tax. See id., at 685 (opinion\nof Harlan, J.). Applying a stricter standard, we concluded\nthat a State \u201cviolates the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment whenever it makes the affluence\nof the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard.\u201d\nId., at 666 (opinion of the Court). We used the term \u201cin-\nvidiously discriminate\u201d to describe conduct prohibited\nunder that standard, noting that we had previously held\nthat while a State may obviously impose \u201creasonable\nresidence restrictions on the availability of the ballot,\u201d it\n\u201cmay not deny the opportunity to vote to a bona fide resi-\ndent merely because he is a member of the armed ser-\nvices.\u201d Id., at 666\u2013667 (citing Carrington v. Rash, 380\nU. S. 89, 96 (1965)). Although the State\u2019s justification for\nthe tax was rational, it was invidious because it was ir-\nrelevant to the voter\u2019s qualifications.\n   Thus, under the standard applied in Harper, even ra-\ntional restrictions on the right to vote are invidious if they\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 We also agree with the unanimous view of those judges that the\nDemocrats have standing to challenge the validity of SEA 483 and that\nthere is no need to decide whether the other petitioners also have\nstanding.\n6        CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                       Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nare unrelated to voter qualifications. In Anderson v.\nCelebrezze, 460 U. S. 780 (1983), however, we confirmed\nthe general rule that \u201cevenhanded restrictions that protect\nthe integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself\u201d\nare not invidious and satisfy the standard set forth in\nHarper. 460 U. S., at 788, n. 9. Rather than applying any\n\u201clitmus test\u201d that would neatly separate valid from invalid\nrestrictions, we concluded that a court must identify and\nevaluate the interests put forward by the State as justifi-\ncations for the burden imposed by its rule, and then make\nthe \u201chard judgment\u201d that our adversary system demands.\n   In later election cases we have followed Anderson\u2019s\nbalancing approach. Thus, in Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S.\n279, 288\u2013289 (1992), after identifying the burden Illinois\nimposed on a political party\u2019s access to the ballot, we\n\u201ccalled for the demonstration of a corresponding interest\nsufficiently weighty to justify the limitation,\u201d and con-\ncluded that the \u201csevere restriction\u201d was not justified by a\nnarrowly drawn state interest of compelling importance.\nLater, in Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428 (1992), we\napplied Anderson\u2019s standard for \u201c \u2018reasonable, nondis-\ncriminatory restrictions,\u2019 \u201d 504 U. S., at 434, and upheld\nHawaii\u2019s prohibition on write-in voting despite the fact\nthat it prevented a significant number of \u201cvoters from\nparticipating in Hawaii elections in a meaningful man-\nner.\u201d Id., at 443 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). We reaffirmed\nAnderson\u2019s requirement that a court evaluating a constitu-\ntional challenge to an election regulation weigh the as-\nserted injury to the right to vote against the \u201c \u2018precise\ninterests put forward by the State as justifications for the\nburden imposed by its rule.\u2019 \u201d 504 U.

The Burdick opinion was explicit in its endorsement and\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                     7\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   In neither Norman nor Burdick did we identify any\nlitmus test for measuring the severity of a burden that a\nstate law imposes on a political party, an individual voter,\nor a discrete class of voters. However slight that burden\nmay appear, as Harper demonstrates, it must be justified\nby relevant and legitimate state interests \u201csufficiently\nweighty to justify the limitation.\u201d Norman, 502 U. S.,\nat 288\u2013289. We therefore begin our analysis of the con-\nstitutionality of Indiana\u2019s statute by focusing on those\ninterests.\n                               II\n   The State has identified several state interests that\narguably justify the burdens that SEA 483 imposes on\nvoters and potential voters. While petitioners argue that\nthe statute was actually motivated by partisan concerns\nand dispute both the significance of the State\u2019s interests\nand the magnitude of any real threat to those interests,\nthey do not question the legitimacy of the interests the\nState has identified. Each is unquestionably relevant to\nthe State\u2019s interest in protecting the integrity and reliabil-\nity of the electoral process.\n   The first is the interest in deterring and detecting voter\nfraud. The State has a valid interest in participating in a\nnationwide effort to improve and modernize election pro-\ncedures that have been criticized as antiquated and ineffi-\ncient.9 The State also argues that it has a particular\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nadherence to Anderson, see 504 U. S., at 434, and repeatedly cited\nAnderson, see 504 U. S., at 436, n. 5, 440, n. 9, 441. To be sure, Burdick\nrejected the argument that strict scrutiny applies to all laws imposing a\nburden on the right to vote; but in its place, the Court applied the\n\u201c \u2018flexible standard\u2019 \u201d set forth in Anderson. Burdick surely did not\ncreate a novel \u201cdeferential \u2018important regulatory interests\u2019 standard.\u201d\nSee post, at 1\u20132.\n    9 See National Commission on Federal Election Reform, To Assure\n\nPride and Confidence in the Electoral Process 18 (2002) (with Honorary\nCo-chairs former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter).\n8       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ninterest in preventing voter fraud in response to a problem\nthat is in part the product of its own maladministration\u2014\nnamely, that Indiana\u2019s voter registration rolls include a\nlarge number of names of persons who are either deceased\nor no longer live in Indiana. Finally, the State relies on its\ninterest in safeguarding voter confidence. Each of these\ninterests merits separate comment.\nElection Modernization\n   Two recently enacted federal statutes have made it\nnecessary for States to reexamine their election proce-\ndures. Both contain provisions consistent with a State\u2019s\nchoice to use government-issued photo identification as a\nrelevant source of information concerning a citizen\u2019s eligi-\nbility to vote.\n   In the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA),\n107 Stat. 77, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973gg et seq., Congress estab-\nlished procedures that would both increase the number of\nregistered voters and protect the integrity of the electoral\nprocess. \u00a71973gg. The statute requires state motor vehi-\ncle driver\u2019s license applications to serve as voter registra-\ntion applications. \u00a71973gg\u20133. While that requirement has\nincreased the number of registered voters, the statute also\ncontains a provision restricting States\u2019 ability to remove\nnames from the lists of registered voters. \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(3).\nThese protections have been partly responsible for inflated\nlists of registered voters. For example, evidence credited\nby Judge Barker estimated that as of 2004 Indiana\u2019s voter\nrolls were inflated by as much as 41.4%, see 458 F. Supp.\n2d, at 793, and data collected by the Election Assistance\nCommittee in 2004 indicated that 19 of 92 Indiana coun-\nties had registration totals exceeding 100% of the 2004\nvoting-age population, Dept. of Justice Complaint in\nUnited States v. Indiana, No. 1:06\u2013cv\u20131000\u2013RLY\u2013TAB\n(SD Ind., June 27, 2006), p. 4, App. 313.\n   In HAVA, Congress required every State to create and\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

HAVA\nalso requires the States to verify voter information con-\ntained in a voter registration application and specifies\neither an \u201capplicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license number\u201d or \u201cthe last\n4 digits of the applicant\u2019s social security number\u201d as\nacceptable verifications. \u00a715483(a)(5)(A)(i). If an indi-\nvidual has neither number, the State is required to\nassign the applicant a voter identification number.\n\u00a715483(a)(5)(A)(ii).\n   HAVA also imposes new identification requirements for\nindividuals registering to vote for the first time who sub-\nmit their applications by mail. If the voter is casting his\nballot in person, he must present local election officials\nwith written identification, which may be either \u201ca current\nand valid photo identification\u201d or another form of docu-\nmentation such as a bank statement or paycheck.\n\u00a715483(b)(2)(A). If the voter is voting by mail, he must\ninclude a copy of the identification with his ballot. A voter\nmay also include a copy of the documentation with his\napplication or provide his driver\u2019s license number or Social\nSecurity number for verification. \u00a715483(b)(3). Finally, in\na provision entitled \u201cFail-safe voting,\u201d HAVA authorizes\nthe casting of provisional ballots by challenged voters.\n\u00a715483(b)(2)(B).\n   Of course, neither HAVA nor NVRA required Indiana to\nenact SEA 483, but they do indicate that Congress be-\nlieves that photo identification is one effective method of\nestablishing a voter\u2019s qualification to vote and that the\nintegrity of elections is enhanced through improved tech-\nnology. That conclusion is also supported by a report\nissued shortly after the enactment of SEA 483 by the\nCommission on Federal Election Reform chaired by former\nPresident Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State\nJames A. Baker III, which is a part of the record in these\ncases. In the introduction to their discussion of voter\n10       CRAWFORD v.

In the old days and in small towns where\n     everyone knows each other, voters did not need to\n     identify themselves. But in the United States, where\n     40 million people move each year, and in urban areas\n     where some people do not even know the people living\n     in their own apartment building let alone their pre-\n     cinct, some form of identification is needed.\n        \u201cThere is no evidence of extensive fraud in U. S.\n     elections or of multiple voting, but both occur, and it\n     could affect the outcome of a close election. The elec-\n     toral system cannot inspire public confidence if no\n     safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm\n     the identity of voters.

The\nrecord contains no evidence of any such fraud actually\noccurring in Indiana at any time in its history. Moreover,\npetitioners argue that provisions of the Indiana Criminal\nCode punishing such conduct as a felony provide adequate\nprotection against the risk that such conduct will occur in\nthe future. It remains true, however, that flagrant exam-\nples of such fraud in other parts of the country have been\ndocumented throughout this Nation\u2019s history by respected\nhistorians and journalists,11 that occasional examples have\nsurfaced in recent years,12 and that Indiana\u2019s own experi-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(prepared by Election Data Services, Inc.), online at http://\nwww.eac.gov/clearinghouse/clearinghouse/2004-election-day-survey (all\nInternet materials as visited Apr. 16, 2008, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file).

Moreover, the interest in orderly administration\nand accurate recordkeeping provides a sufficient justifica-\ntion for carefully identifying all voters participating in the\nelection process. While the most effective method of pre-\nventing election fraud may well be debatable, the propri-\nety of doing so is perfectly clear.\n   In its brief, the State argues that the inflation of its\nvoter rolls provides further support for its enactment of\nSEA 483.

Burdens of that sort arising from\nlife\u2019s vagaries, however, are neither so serious nor so\nfrequent as to raise any question about the constitutional-\nity of SEA 483; the availability of the right to cast a provi-\nsional ballot provides an adequate remedy for problems of\nthat character.\n   The burdens that are relevant to the issue before us are\nthose imposed on persons who are eligible to vote but do\nnot possess a current photo identification that complies\nwith the requirements of SEA 483.16 The fact that most\nvoters already possess a valid driver\u2019s license, or some\nother form of acceptable identification, would not save the\nstatute under our reasoning in Harper, if the State re-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 For a survey of state practice, see Brief for Texas et al. as Amici\nCuriae 10\u201314, and nn. 1\u201323.\n  16 Ind.

But just as other States provide free voter\nregistration cards, the photo identification cards issued by\nIndiana\u2019s BMV are also free. For most voters who need\nthem, the inconvenience of making a trip to the BMV,\ngathering the required documents, and posing for a photo-\ngraph surely does not qualify as a substantial burden on\nthe right to vote, or even represent a significant increase\nover the usual burdens of voting.17\n   Both evidence in the record and facts of which we may\ntake judicial notice, however, indicate that a somewhat\nheavier burden may be placed on a limited number of\npersons. They include elderly persons born out-of-state,\nwho may have difficulty obtaining a birth certificate;18\npersons who because of economic or other personal limita-\ntions may find it difficult either to secure a copy of their\nbirth certificate or to assemble the other required docu-\nmentation to obtain a state-issued identification; homeless\npersons; and persons with a religious objection to being\nphotographed. If we assume, as the evidence suggests,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 To obtain a photo identification card a person must present at least\none \u201cprimary\u201d document, which can be a birth certificate, certificate of\nnaturalization, U. S. veterans photo identification, U. S. military photo\nidentification, or a U. S. passport. Ind. Admin. Code, tit. 140, \u00a77\u20134\u20133\n(2008). Indiana, like most States, charges a fee for obtaining a copy of\none\u2019s birth certificate. This fee varies by county and is currently\nbetween $3 and $12. See Indiana State Department of Health Web\npage, http://www.in.gov/isdh/bdcertifs/lhdfees/toc.htm.     Some States\ncharge substantially more.

Admin. Code, tit. 140, \u00a77\u20134\u20133\n(\u201cThe commissioner or the commissioner\u2019s designee may accept reason-\nable alternate documents to satisfy the requirements of this rule\u201d).\n16       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nthat some members of these classes were registered voters\nwhen SEA 483 was enacted, the new identification re-\nquirement may have imposed a special burden on their\nright to vote.\n   The severity of that burden is, of course, mitigated by\nthe fact that, if eligible, voters without photo identification\nmay cast provisional ballots that will ultimately be\ncounted. To do so, however, they must travel to the circuit\ncourt clerk\u2019s office within 10 days to execute the required\naffidavit. It is unlikely that such a requirement would\npose a constitutional problem unless it is wholly unjusti-\nfied. And even assuming that the burden may not be\njustified as to a few voters,19 that conclusion is by no\nmeans sufficient to establish petitioners\u2019 right to the relief\nthey seek in this litigation.\n                            IV\n  Given the fact that petitioners have advanced a broad\nattack on the constitutionality of SEA 483, seeking relief\nthat would invalidate the statute in all its applications,\nthey bear a heavy burden of persuasion. Only a few weeks\nago we held that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit had failed to give appropriate weight to the magni-\ntude of that burden when it sustained a preelection, facial\nattack on a Washington statute regulating that State\u2019s\nprimary election procedures. Washington State Grange v.\nWashington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\nOur reasoning in that case applies with added force to the\narguments advanced by petitioners in these cases.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 Presumably   most voters casting provisional ballots will be able to\nobtain photo identifications before the next election. It is, however,\ndifficult to understand why the State should require voters with a faith-\nbased objection to being photographed to cast provisional ballots subject\nto later verification in every election when the BMV is able to issue\nthese citizens special licenses that enable them to drive without any\nphoto identification. See Ind. Code Ann. 9\u201324\u201311\u20135(c) (West Supp.\n2007).\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   Petitioners ask this Court, in effect, to perform a unique\nbalancing analysis that looks specifically at a small num-\nber of voters who may experience a special burden under\nthe statute and weighs their burdens against the State\u2019s\nbroad interests in protecting election integrity. Petition-\ners urge us to ask whether the State\u2019s interests justify the\nburden imposed on voters who cannot afford or obtain a\nbirth certificate and who must make a second trip to the\ncircuit court clerk\u2019s office after voting. But on the basis of\nthe evidence in the record it is not possible to quantify\neither the magnitude of the burden on this narrow class of\nvoters or the portion of the burden imposed on them that\nis fully justified.\n   First, the evidence in the record does not provide us\nwith the number of registered voters without photo identi-\nfication; Judge Barker found petitioners\u2019 expert\u2019s report to\nbe \u201cutterly incredible and unreliable.\u201d 458 F. Supp. 2d, at\n803. Much of the argument about the numbers of such\nvoters comes from extrarecord, postjudgment studies, the\naccuracy of which has not been tested in the trial court.\n   Further, the deposition evidence presented in the Dis-\ntrict Court does not provide any concrete evidence of the\nburden imposed on voters who currently lack photo identi-\nfication. The record includes depositions of two case man-\nagers at a day shelter for homeless persons and the depo-\nsitions of members of the plaintiff organizations, none of\nwhom expressed a personal inability to vote under SEA\n483. A deposition from a named plaintiff describes the\ndifficulty the elderly woman had in obtaining an identifi-\ncation card, although her testimony indicated that she\nintended to return to the BMV since she had recently\nobtained her birth certificate and that she was able to pay\nthe birth certificate fee. App. 94.\n   Judge Barker\u2019s opinion makes reference to six other\nelderly named plaintiffs who do not have photo identifica-\ntions, but several of these individuals have birth certifi-\n18       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ncates or were born in Indiana and have not indicated how\ndifficult it would be for them to obtain a birth certificate.\n458 F. Supp. 2d, at 797\u2013799. One elderly named plaintiff\nstated that she had attempted to obtain a birth certificate\nfrom Tennessee, but had not been successful, and another\ntestified that he did not know how to obtain a birth certifi-\ncate from North Carolina. The elderly in Indiana, how-\never, may have an easier time obtaining a photo identifi-\ncation card than the nonelderly, see n. 17, supra, and\nalthough it may not be a completely acceptable alterna-\ntive, the elderly in Indiana are able to vote absentee with-\nout presenting photo identification.\n   The record says virtually nothing about the difficulties\nfaced by either indigent voters or voters with religious\nobjections to being photographed. While one elderly man\nstated that he did not have the money to pay for a birth\ncertificate, when asked if he did not have the money or did\nnot wish to spend it, he replied, \u201cboth.\u201d App. 211\u2013212.\nFrom this limited evidence we do not know the magnitude\nof the impact SEA 483 will have on indigent voters in\nIndiana. The record does contain the affidavit of one\nhomeless woman who has a copy of her birth certificate,\nbut was denied a photo identification card because she did\nnot have an address. Id., at 67. But that single affidavit\ngives no indication of how common the problem is.\n   In sum, on the basis of the record that has been made in\nthis litigation, we cannot conclude that the statute im-\nposes \u201cexcessively burdensome requirements\u201d on any class\nof voters. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 738 (1974).20\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 Three comments on JUSTICE SOUTER\u2019s speculation about the non-\n\ntrivial burdens that SEA 483 may impose on \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of\nIndiana citizens, post, at 1 (dissenting opinion), are appropriate. First,\nthe fact that the District Judge estimated that when the statute was\npassed in 2005, 43,000 citizens did not have photo identification, see\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2568119\"><a href=\"/opinion/2568119/indiana-democratic-party-v-rokita/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

When we consider only the statute\u2019s\nbroad application to all Indiana voters we conclude that it\n\u201cimposes only a limited burden on voters\u2019 rights.\u201d Bur-\ndick, 504 U. S., at 439. The \u201c \u2018precise interests\u2019 \u201d advanced\nby the State are therefore sufficient to defeat petitioners\u2019\nfacial challenge to SEA 483. Id., at 434.\n   Finally we note that petitioners have not demonstrated\nthat the proper remedy\u2014even assuming an unjustified\nburden on some voters\u2014would be to invalidate the entire\nstatute. When evaluating a neutral, nondiscriminatory\nregulation of voting procedure, \u201c[w]e must keep in mind\nthat \u201c \u2018[a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the in-\ntent of the elected representatives of the people.\u2019 \u201d Ayotte\nv. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfact that public transportation is not available in some Indiana counties\ntells us nothing about how often elderly and indigent citizens have an\nopportunity to obtain a photo identification at the BMV, either during a\nroutine outing with family or friends or during a special visit to the\nBMV arranged by a civic or political group such as the League of\nWomen Voters or a political party. Further, nothing in the record\nestablishes the distribution of voters who lack photo identification. To\nthe extent that the evidence sheds any light on that issue, it suggests\nthat such voters reside primarily in metropolitan areas, which are\nserved by public transportation in Indiana (the majority of the plain-\ntiffs reside in Indianapolis and several of the organizational plaintiffs\nare Indianapolis organizations). Third, the indigent, elderly, or dis-\nabled need not \u201cjourney all the way to their county seat each time they\nwish to exercise the franchise,\u201d post, at 29, if they obtain a free photo\nidentification card from the BMV. While it is true that obtaining a\nbirth certificate carries with it a financial cost, the record does not\nprovide even a rough estimate of how many indigent voters lack copies\nof their birth certificates. Supposition based on extensive Internet\nresearch is not an adequate substitute for admissible evidence subject\nto cross-examination in constitutional adjudication.\n20       CRAWFORD v.

Supp. 2d, at 783. It is fair to infer\nthat partisan considerations may have played a significant\nrole in the decision to enact SEA 483. If such considera-\ntions had provided the only justification for a photo identi-\nfication requirement, we may also assume that SEA 483\nwould suffer the same fate as the poll tax at issue in\nHarper.\n   But if a nondiscriminatory law is supported by valid\nneutral justifications, those justifications should not be\ndisregarded simply because partisan interests may have\nprovided one motivation for the votes of individual legisla-\ntors. The state interests identified as justifications for\nSEA 483 are both neutral and sufficiently strong to re-\nquire us to reject petitioners\u2019 facial attack on the statute.\nThe application of the statute to the vast majority of Indi-\nana voters is amply justified by the valid interest in pro-\ntecting \u201cthe integrity and reliability of the electoral proc-\ness.\u201d Anderson, 460 U.

That is true enough, but for the sake of\nclarity and finality (as well as adherence to precedent), I\nprefer to decide these cases on the grounds that petition-\ners\u2019 premise is irrelevant and that the burden at issue is\nminimal and justified.\n   To evaluate a law respecting the right to vote\u2014whether\nit governs voter qualifications, candidate selection, or the\nvoting process\u2014we use the approach set out in Burdick v.\nTakushi, 504 U. S. 428 (1992). This calls for application of\na deferential \u201cimportant regulatory interests\u201d standard for\nnonsevere, nondiscriminatory restrictions, reserving strict\n2       CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nscrutiny for laws that severely restrict the right to vote.\nId., at 433\u2013434 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nlead opinion resists the import of Burdick by characteriz-\ning it as simply adopting \u201cthe balancing approach\u201d of\nAnderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780 (1983) (majority\nopinion of STEVENS, J.). See ante, at 6; see also ante, at 6\u2013\n7, n. 8. Although Burdick liberally quoted Anderson,\nBurdick forged Anderson\u2019s amorphous \u201cflexible standard\u201d\ninto something resembling an administrable rule. See\nBurdick, supra, at 434. Since Burdick, we have repeatedly\nreaffirmed the primacy of its two-track approach. See\nTimmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351,\n358 (1997); Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S. 581, 586\u2013587\n(2005). \u201c[S]trict scrutiny is appropriate only if the burden\nis severe.\u201d Id., at 592. Thus, the first step is to decide\nwhether a challenged law severely burdens the right to\nvote. Ordinary and widespread burdens, such as those\nrequiring \u201cnominal effort\u201d of everyone, are not severe. See\nid., at 591, 593\u2013597. Burdens are severe if they go beyond\nthe merely inconvenient. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S.\n724, 728\u2013729 (1974) (characterizing the law in Williams v.\nRhodes, 393 U. S. 23 (1968), as \u201csevere\u201d because it was \u201cso\nburdensome\u201d as to be \u201c \u2018virtually impossible\u2019 \u201d to satisfy).\n  Of course, we have to identify a burden before we can\nweigh it. The Indiana law affects different voters differ-\nently, ante, at 14\u201316, but what petitioners view as the\nlaw\u2019s several light and heavy burdens are no more than\nthe different impacts of the single burden that the law\nuniformly imposes on all voters. To vote in person in\nIndiana, everyone must have and present a photo identifi-\ncation that can be obtained for free. The State draws no\nclassifications, let alone discriminatory ones, except to\nestablish optional absentee and provisional balloting for\ncertain poor, elderly, and institutionalized voters and for\nreligious objectors. Nor are voters who already have photo\nidentifications exempted from the burden, since those\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nvoters must maintain the accuracy of the information\ndisplayed on the identifications, renew them before they\nexpire, and replace them if they are lost.\n   The Indiana photo-identification law is a generally\napplicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation, and our\nprecedents refute the view that individual impacts are\nrelevant to determining the severity of the burden it im-\nposes. In the course of concluding that the Hawaii laws at\nissue in Burdick \u201cimpose[d] only a limited burden on\nvoters\u2019 rights to make free choices and to associate politi-\ncally through the vote,\u201d 504 U. S., at 439, we considered\nthe laws and their reasonably foreseeable effect on voters\ngenerally. See id., at 436\u2013437. We did not discuss\nwhether the laws had a severe effect on Mr. Burdick\u2019s own\nright to vote, given his particular circumstances. That\nwas essentially the approach of the Burdick dissenters,\nwho would have applied strict scrutiny to the laws because\nof their effect on \u201csome voters.\u201d See id., at 446 (KENNEDY,\nJ., dissenting); see also id., at 448 (\u201cThe majority\u2019s analy-\nsis ignores the inevitable and significant burden a write-in\nban imposes upon some individual voters . . . .\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). Subsequent cases have followed Burdick\u2019s gener-\nalized review of nondiscriminatory election laws. See, e.g.,\nTimmons, supra, at 361\u2013362; Clingman, supra, at 590\u2013\n591, 592\u2013593. Indeed, Clingman\u2019s holding that burdens\nare not severe if they are ordinary and widespread would\nbe rendered meaningless if a single plaintiff could claim a\nsevere burden.\n   Not all of our decisions predating Burdick addressed\nwhether a challenged voting regulation severely burdened\nthe right to vote, but when we began to grapple with the\nmagnitude of burdens, we did so categorically and did not\nconsider the peculiar circumstances of individual voters or\ncandidates. See, e.g., Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431,\n438\u2013441 (1971). Thus, in Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U. S.\n752 (1973), we did not link the State\u2019s interest in inhibit-\n4        CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ning party raiding with the petitioners\u2019 own circumstances.\nSee id., at 760\u2013762. And in Storer v. Brown, supra, we\nobserved that the severity of the burden of a regulation\nshould be measured according to its \u201cnature, extent, and\nlikely impact.\u201d Id., at 738 (emphasis added). We therefore\ninstructed the District Court to decide on remand whether\n\u201ca reasonably diligent independent candidate [could] be\nexpected to satisfy the signature requirements, or will it\nbe only rarely that the unaffiliated candidate will succeed\nin getting on the ballot?\u201d Id., at 742 (emphasis added).\nNotably, we did not suggest that the District Court should\nconsider whether one of the petitioners would actually find\nit more difficult than a reasonably diligent candidate to\nobtain the required signatures. What mattered was the\ngeneral assessment of the burden.\n   Insofar as our election-regulation cases rest upon the\nrequirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Ander-\nson, supra, at 786, n. 7, weighing the burden of a nondis-\ncriminatory voting law upon each voter and concomitantly\nrequiring exceptions for vulnerable voters would effec-\ntively turn back decades of equal-protection jurisprudence.\nA voter complaining about such a law\u2019s effect on him has\nno valid equal-protection claim because, without proof of\ndiscriminatory intent, a generally applicable law with\ndisparate impact is not unconstitutional. See, e.g., Wash-\nington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 248 (1976). The Fourteenth\nAmendment does not regard neutral laws as invidious\nones, even when their burdens purportedly fall dispropor-\ntionately on a protected class. A fortiori it does not do so\nwhen, as here, the classes complaining of disparate impact\nare not even protected.* See Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * A number of our early right-to-vote decisions, purporting to rely\nupon the Equal Protection Clause, strictly scrutinized nondiscrimina-\ntory voting laws requiring the payment of fees.

This is an area where the dos and\ndon\u2019ts need to be known in advance of the election, and\nvoter-by-voter examination of the burdens of voting regu-\nlations would prove especially disruptive. A case-by-case\napproach naturally encourages constant litigation. Very\nfew new election regulations improve everyone\u2019s lot, so the\npotential allegations of severe burden are endless. A State\nreducing the number of polling places would be open to the\ncomplaint it has violated the rights of disabled voters who\nlive near the closed stations. Indeed, it may even be the\ncase that some laws already on the books are especially\nburdensome for some voters, and one can predict lawsuits\ndemanding that a State adopt voting over the Internet or\nexpand absentee balloting.\n   That sort of detailed judicial supervision of the election\nprocess would flout the Constitution\u2019s express commit-\nment of the task to the States. See Art. I, \u00a74. It is for\nstate legislatures to weigh the costs and benefits of possi-\nble changes to their election codes, and their judgment\nmust prevail unless it imposes a severe and unjustified\noverall burden upon the right to vote, or is intended to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n415 U.

S. 428 (1992), does not already encompass, it suffices to note that we\nhave never held that legislatures must calibrate all election laws, even\nthose totally unrelated to money, for their impacts on poor voters or\nmust otherwise accommodate wealth disparities.\n6      CRAWFORD v.

And the State\u2019s interests,\nante, at 7\u201313, are sufficient to sustain that minimal bur-\nden. That should end the matter.

It translates into an obvious\neconomic cost (whether in work time lost, or getting and\npaying for transportation) that an Indiana voter must bear\nto obtain an ID.\n   For those voters who can afford the roundtrip, a second\nfinancial hurdle appears: in order to get photo identifica-\ntion for the first time, they need to present \u201c \u2018a birth cer-\ntificate, a certificate of naturalization, U.

S.\ncitizenship by birth. The total fees for a passport, more-\nover, are up to about $100.17 So most voters must pay at\nleast one fee to get the ID necessary to cast a regular\nballot.18 As with the travel costs, these fees are far from\nshocking on their face, but in the Burdick analysis it\nmatters that both the travel costs and the fees are dispro-\nportionately heavy for, and thus disproportionately likely\nto deter, the poor, the old, and the immobile.\n                              B\n   To be sure, Indiana has a provisional-ballot exception to\nthe ID requirement for individuals the State considers\n\u201cindigent\u201d19 as well as those with religious objections to\nbeing photographed, see ante, at 15 (lead opinion), and\nthis sort of exception could in theory provide a way around\nthe costs of procuring an ID. But Indiana\u2019s chosen excep-\ntion does not amount to much relief.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 See Department of State, How to Apply in Person for a Passport,\n\nhttp://travel.state.gov/passport/get/first/first_830.html; Department of\nState, Passport Fees (Feb. 1, 2008), http://travel.state.gov/passport/\nget/fees/fees_837.html (total fees of $100 for a passport book and $45 for\na passport card for individuals 16 and older).\n  18 The lead opinion notes that \u201cthe record does not provide even a\n\nrough estimate of how many indigent voters lack copies of their birth\ncertificates.\u201d Ante, at 19, n. 20. But the record discloses no reason to\nthink that any appreciable number of poor voters would need birth\ncertificates absent the Voter ID Law, and no reason to believe that poor\npeople would spend money to get them if they did not need them.\n  19 To vote by provisional ballot, an individual must (at the circuit\n\ncourt clerk\u2019s office) sign an affidavit affirming that she is \u201cindigent\u201d and\n\u201cunable to obtain proof of identification without payment of a fee.\u201d Ind.\nCode Ann. \u00a73\u201311.7\u20135\u20132.5(c)(2)(A). Indiana law does not define the key\nterms \u201cindigent\u201d or \u201cunable,\u201d but I will assume for present purposes\nthat the Indiana Supreme Court will eventually construe these terms\nbroadly, so that the income threshold for indigency is at least at the\nfederal poverty level, and so that the exception covers even individuals\nwho are facing only short-term financial difficulties.\n                      Cite as: 553 U.

See 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 786 (citing Ind. Code Ann. \u00a73\u201311\u20138\u201325.1\n(West Supp. 2007)). As the lead opinion recognizes,\nthough, ante, at 15, that is only the first step; to have the\nprovisional ballot counted, a voter must then appear in\nperson before the circuit court clerk or county election\nboard within 10 days of the election, to sign an affidavit\nattesting to indigency or religious objection to being pho-\ntographed (or to present an ID at that point),20 see 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 786. Unlike the trip to the BMV (which,\nassuming things go smoothly, needs to be made only once\nevery four years for renewal of nondriver photo identifica-\ntion, see id.), this one must be taken every time a poor\nperson or religious objector wishes to vote, because the\nState does not allow an affidavit to count in successive\nelections. And unlike the trip to the BMV (which at least\nhas a handful of license branches in the more populous\ncounties), a county has only one county seat. Forcing\nthese people to travel to the county seat every time they\ntry to vote is particularly onerous for the reason noted\nalready, that most counties in Indiana either lack public\ntransportation or offer only limited coverage. See supra,\nat 6\u20137.\n   That the need to travel to the county seat each election\namounts to a high hurdle is shown in the results of the\n2007 municipal elections in Marion County, to which\nIndiana\u2019s Voter ID Law applied. Thirty-four provisional\nballots were cast, but only two provisional voters made it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  20 Indiana law allows voters to cast a provisional ballot at the county\n\nclerk\u2019s office starting 29 days prior to election day until noon of the day\nprior to election day, see Ind. Code Ann. \u00a73\u201311.7\u20135\u20132.5, and this might\nenable some voters to make only one burdensome trip to the county\nseat. But for the voters who show up at the polls to vote and are there\ntold that they lack the photo identification needed to cast a regular\nballot, the Voter ID Law effectively forces them to make two trips.\n10       CRAWFORD v.

All 34 of these\naspiring voters appeared at the appropriate precinct; 33 of\nthem provided a signature, and every signature matched\nthe one on file; and 26 of the 32 voters whose ballots were\nnot counted had a history of voting in Marion County\nelections. See id., at 9.\n   All of this suggests that provisional ballots do not obvi-\nate the burdens of getting photo identification. And even\nif that were not so, the provisional-ballot option would be\ninadequate for a further reason: the indigency exception\nby definition offers no relief to those voters who do not\nconsider themselves (or would not be considered) indigent\nbut as a practical matter would find it hard, for nonfinan-\ncial reasons, to get the required ID (most obviously the\ndisabled).\n                             C\n  Indiana\u2019s Voter ID Law thus threatens to impose serious\nburdens on the voting right, even if not \u201csevere\u201d ones, and\nthe next question under Burdick is whether the number of\nindividuals likely to be affected is significant as well.\nRecord evidence and facts open to judicial notice answer\nyes.\n  Although the District Court found that petitioners failed\nto offer any reliable empirical study of numbers of voters\naffected, see ante, at 17 (lead opinion),21 we may accept\nthat court\u2019s rough calculation that 43,000 voting-age\nresidents lack the kind of identification card required by\nIndiana\u2019s law.

First, the District Court\nnoted that BMV records do not cover all forms of identification that\nmay be used to vote under the Voter ID Law (e.g., federal photo identi-\nfication, such as a passport). This is a valid consideration, but is\nunlikely to overcome the additions that must be made for the various\nfactors listed above. Second, the court noted that the BMV records do\nnot account for the exceptions to the photo identification requirement\n(such as the indigency and absentee-ballot exceptions). This factor does\nnot warrant a deduction of the 43,000 number because, as I have\nargued, the indigency exception imposes serious burdens of its own, see\nsupra, at 8\u201310, and the absentee-ballot exception is not a wholly\nadequate substitute for voting in person, see n. 4, supra.

A large\nproportion of them are likely to be in bad shape economi-\ncally, see 472 F. 3d 949, 951 (CA7 2007) (\u201cNo doubt most\npeople who don\u2019t have photo ID are low on the economic\nladder\u201d); cf. Bullock v. Carter, 405 U. S. 134, 144 (1972)\n(\u201c[W]e would ignore reality were we not to recognize that\nthis system falls with unequal weight on voters . . . accord-\ning to their economic status\u201d).25 The Voter ID Law places\nhurdles in the way of either getting an ID or of voting\nprovisionally, and they translate into nontrivial economic\ncosts. There is accordingly no reason to doubt that a sig-\nnificant number of state residents will be discouraged or\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nestimate to exclude citizens who are not registered to vote, or who are\nregistered but not planning to vote. See Brief for Respondents in No.\n07\u201325, p. 25; see also ante, at 17 (lead opinion) (\u201c[T]he evidence in the\nrecord does not provide us with the number of registered voters without\nphoto identification\u201d). But that argument is flatly contradicted by this\nCourt\u2019s settled precedent. As our cases have recognized, disfranchise-\nment is disfranchisement, whether or not the disfranchised voter would\nhave voted if given the choice. That is why in Dunn v. Blumstein, 405\nU. S. 330 (1972), the Court did not ask whether any significant number\nof individuals deprived of the right to vote by durational residence\nrequirements would actually have chosen to vote. And in Harper v.\nVirginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663 (1966), the Court did not pause\nto consider whether any of the qualified voters deterred by the $1.50\npoll tax would have opted to vote if there had been no fee. Our cases\nmake clear that the Constitution protects an individual\u2019s ability to vote,\nnot merely his decision to do so.\n  25 Studies in other States suggest that the burdens of an ID require-\n\nment may also fall disproportionately upon racial minorities. See\nOverton, Voter Identification, 105 Mich. L. Rev. 631, 659 (2007) (\u201cIn\n1994, the U. S. Department of Justice found that African-Americans in\nLouisiana were four to five times less likely than white residents to\nhave government-sanctioned photo identification\u201d); id., at 659\u2013660\n(describing June 2005 study by the Employment and Training Institute\nat the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, which found that while 17%\nof voting-age whites lacked a valid driver\u2019s license, 55% of black males\nand 49% of black females were unlicensed, and 46% of Latino males\nand 59% of Latino females were similarly unlicensed).\n14       CRAWFORD v.

See ante, at 7\u201313. On closer look,\nhowever, it appears that the first two (which are really\njust one) can claim modest weight at best, and the latter\ntwo if anything weaken the State\u2019s case.\n                              A\n  The lead opinion\u2019s discussion of the State\u2019s reasons\nbegins with the State\u2019s asserted interests in \u201celection\nmodernization,\u201d ante, at 8\u201310, and in combating voter\nfraud, see ante, at 11\u201313. Although these are given sepa-\nrate headings, any line drawn between them is unconvinc-\ning; as I understand it, the \u201ceffort to modernize elections,\u201d\nBrief for Respondents in No. 07\u201325, p. 12, is not for mod-\nernity\u2019s sake, but to reach certain practical (or political)\nobjectives.27 In any event, if a proposed modernization\nwere in fact aimless, if it were put forward as change for\nchange\u2019s sake, a State could not justify any appreciable\nburden on the right to vote that might ensue; useless\ntechnology has no constitutional value. And in fact that is\nnot the case here. The State says that it adopted the ID\nlaw principally to combat voter fraud, and it is this claim,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  27 See generally R. Saltman, The History and Politics of Voting Tech-\nnology: In Quest of Integrity and Public Confidence (2006) (tracing the\nhistory of changes in methods of voting in the United States, and the\nsocial and political considerations behind them).\n18      CRAWFORD v.

See Purcell, 549\nU. S., at 4 (acknowledging \u201cthe State\u2019s compelling interest\nin preventing voter fraud\u201d); cf. Eu v. San Francisco County\nDemocratic Central Comm., 489 U.

But it takes several\nsteps to get beyond the level of abstraction here.\n   To begin with, requiring a voter to show photo identifi-\ncation before casting a regular ballot addresses only one\nform of voter fraud: in-person voter impersonation. The\nphoto ID requirement leaves untouched the problems of\nabsentee-ballot fraud, which (unlike in-person voter im-\npersonation) is a documented problem in Indiana, see 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 793; of registered voters voting more than\nonce (but maintaining their own identities) in different\ncounties or in different States; of felons and other disquali-\nfied individuals voting in their own names; of vote buying;\nor, for that matter, of ballot-stuffing, ballot miscounting,\nvoter intimidation, or any other type of corruption on the\npart of officials administering elections. See Brief for\nBrennan Center for Justice et al. as Amici Curiae 7.\n   And even the State\u2019s interest in deterring a voter from\nshowing up at the polls and claiming to be someone he is\nnot must, in turn, be discounted for the fact that the State\nhas not come across a single instance of in-person voter\nimpersonation fraud in all of Indiana\u2019s history. See 458\nF. Supp. 2d, at 792\u2013793; see also ante, at 11\u201313 (lead\nopinion). Neither the District Court nor the Indiana Gen-\neral Assembly that passed the Voter ID Law was given\nany evidence whatsoever of in-person voter impersonation\nfraud in the State. See 458 F.

Ibid. It is also consistent with\nthe dearth of evidence of in-person voter impersonation in\nany other part of the country. See ante, at 11, n. 11 (lead\nopinion) (conceding that there are at most \u201cscattered\ninstances of in-person voter fraud\u201d); see also Brief for\nBrennan Center for Justice, supra, at 11\u201325, 25 (demon-\nstrating that \u201cthe national evidence\u2014including the very\nevidence relied on by the courts below\u2014suggests that the\ntype of voting fraud that may be remedied by a photo ID\nrequirement is virtually nonexistent: the \u2018problem\u2019 of voter\nimpersonation is not a real problem at all\u201d).28\n   The State responds to the want of evidence with the\nassertion that in-person voter impersonation fraud is hard\nto detect. But this is like saying the \u201cman who wasn\u2019t\nthere\u201d is hard to spot,29 and to know whether difficulty in\ndetection accounts for the lack of evidence one at least has\nto ask whether in-person voter impersonation is (or would\nbe) relatively harder to ferret out than other kinds of fraud\n(e.g., by absentee ballot) which the State has had no trou-\nble documenting.

Minnite & D. Callahan, Securing the Vote: An Analysis\nof Election Fraud 14 (2003). It simply is not worth it for\nindividuals acting alone to commit in-person voter imper-\nsonation, which is relatively ineffectual for the foolish few\nwho may commit it. If an imposter gets caught, he is\nsubject to severe criminal penalties. See, e.g., Ind.

And even\nif he succeeds, the imposter gains nothing more than one\nadditional vote for his candidate.

Levitt, The Truth about Voter\nFraud 7 (2007) (\u201c[F]raud by individual voters is a singu-\nlarly foolish and ineffective way to attempt to win an\nelection. Each act of voter fraud in connection with a\nfederal election risks five years in prison and a $10,000\nfine, in addition to any state penalties. In return, it yields\nat most one incremental vote. That single extra vote is\nsimply not worth the price\u201d (footnote omitted)); cf. 472\nF. 3d, at 951 (\u201c[A] vote in a political election rarely has\nany instrumental value, since elections for political office\nat the state or federal level are never decided by just one\nvote\u201d (emphasis in original)).\n   In sum, fraud by individuals acting alone, however\ndifficult to detect, is unlikely. And while there may be\ngreater incentives for organized groups to engage in broad-\ngauged in-person voter impersonation fraud, see Minnite\n& Callahan, supra, at 20, it is also far more difficult to\nconceal larger enterprises of this sort. The State\u2019s argu-\nment about the difficulty of detecting the fraud lacks real\nforce.\n                              2\n   Nothing else the State has to say does much to bolster\nits case. The State argues, for example, that even without\nevidence of in-person voter impersonation in Indiana, it is\nenough for the State to show that \u201copportunities [for such\nfraud] are transparently obvious in elections without\nidentification checks,\u201d Brief for Respondents in No. 07\u201325,\np. 54. Of course they are, but Indiana elections before the\nVoter ID Law were not run \u201cwithout identification checks\u201d;\n22        CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                          SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\non the contrary, as the Marion County Election Board\ninforms us, \u201c[t]ime-tested systems were in place to detect\nin-person voter impersonation fraud before the challenged\nstatute was enacted,\u201d Brief for Respondents in No. 07\u201321,\np. 6. These included hiring poll workers who were pre-\ncinct residents familiar with the neighborhood, and mak-\ning signature comparisons, each effort being supported by\nthe criminal provisions mentioned before. Id., at 6\u20138.\n   For that matter, the deterrence argument can do only so\nmuch work, since photo identification is itself hardly a\nfailsafe against impersonation. Indiana knows this, and\nthat is why in 2007 the State began to issue redesigned\ndriver\u2019s licenses with digital watermarking.30 The State\nhas made this shift precisely because, in the words of its\nBMV, \u201cvisual inspection is not adequate to determine the\nauthenticity\u201d of driver\u2019s licenses. See Indiana BMV, su-\npra, n. 30. Indeed, the BMV explains that the digital\nwatermarks (which can be scanned using equipment that,\nso far, Indiana does not use at polling places) is needed to\n\u201ctak[e] the guesswork out of inspection.\u201d Ibid.31 So, at\nleast until polling places have the machines and special\nsoftware to scan the new driver\u2019s licenses, and until all the\nlicenses with the older designs expire (the licenses issued\nafter 2006 but before the 2007 redesigning are good until\n2012, see 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 791), Indiana\u2019s law does no\nmore than assure that any in-person voter fraud will take\nplace with fake IDs, not attempted signature forgery.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   30 See Indiana BMV, Digital Drivers License: Frequently Asked Ques-\n\ntions, \u201cWhat is a digital watermark and why is Indiana incorporating it\ninto their driver license?\u201d, http://www.in.gov/bmv/3382.htm.\n   31 In the words of Indiana\u2019s Governor, Mitch Daniels: \u201c \u2018Not very long\n\nago, Indiana driver\u2019s licenses were a late-night talk show joke [because\nof] the ease of their fraudulent issuance and also their duplication . . . .\n[The new design] will make particularly their duplication dramatically\nmore difficult.\u2019 \u201d Udell, Digital Driver\u2019s Licenses Designed To Stem ID\nTheft, Evansville Courier, June 7, 2007, p.

See ante, at 12 (lead opinion).\nI reach this conclusion, like others accepted by the Court,\nbecause \u201c \u2018[w]here a legislature has significantly greater\ninstitutional expertise, as, for example, in the field of\nelection regulation, the Court in practice defers to empiri-\ncal legislative judgments.\u2019 \u201d Randall, 548 U.

But the ultimate valuation of the particular\ninterest a State asserts has to take account of evidence\nagainst it as well as legislative judgments for it (certainly\nwhen the law is one of the most restrictive of its kind, see\nn. 26, supra), and on this record it would be unreasonable\nto accord this assumed state interest more than very\nmodest significance.32\n                             3\n  The antifraud rationale is open to skepticism on one\nfurther ground, what Burdick spoke of as an assessment of\nthe degree of necessity for the State\u2019s particular course of\naction. Two points deserve attention, the first being that\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  32 On such flimsy evidence of fraud, it would also ignore the lessons of\n\nhistory to grant the State\u2019s interest more than modest weight, as the\ninterest in combating voter fraud has too often served as a cover for\nunnecessarily restrictive electoral rules. See F. Ogden, The Poll Tax in\nthe South 9 (1958) (\u201cIn Arkansas and Texas, the argument was fre-\nquently presented that a poll tax payment prerequisite would purify\nelections by preventing repeaters and floaters from voting\u201d); see also\nBrief for Historians and Other Scholars as Amici Curiae 4\u201315 (detailing\nabuses); R. Hayduk, Gatekeepers to the Franchise: Shaping Election\nAdministration in New York 36 (2005) (\u201cIn both historical and contem-\nporary contexts certain groups have had an interest in alleging fraud\nand thereby shaping electoral rules and practices in a restrictive\ndirection, and other groups have had an opposite interest\u201d).\n24      CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthe State has not even tried to justify its decision to im-\nplement the photo identification requirement immediately\non passage of the new law. A phase-in period would have\ngiven the State time to distribute its newly designed li-\ncenses, and to make a genuine effort to get them to indi-\nviduals in need, and a period for transition is exactly what\nthe Commission on Federal Election Reform, headed by\nformer President Carter and former Secretary of State\nBaker, recommended in its report. See Building Confi-\ndence in U. S. Elections \u00a72.5 (Sept. 2005), App. 136, 140\n(hereinafter Carter-Baker Report) (\u201cFor the next two\nfederal elections, until January 1, 2010, in states that\nrequire voters to present ID at the polls, voters who fail to\ndo so should nonetheless be allowed to cast a provisional\nballot, and their ballot would count if their signature is\nverified\u201d). During this phase-in period, the report said,\nStates would need to make \u201cefforts to ensure that all\nvoters are provided convenient opportunities to obtain\u201d the\nrequired identification. Id., at 141. The former President\nand former Secretary of State explained this recommenda-\ntion in an op-ed essay:\n        \u201cYes, we are concerned about the approximately 12\n     percent of citizens who lack a driver\u2019s license.

Individu-\nals unable to get photo identification are forced to travel to\nthe county seat every time they wish to exercise the fran-\nchise, and they have to get there within 10 days of the\nelection. See supra, at 8\u201310. Nothing about the State\u2019s\ninterest in fighting voter fraud justifies this requirement\nof a post-election trip to the county seat instead of some\nverification process at the polling places.\n   In briefing this Court, the State responds by pointing to\nan interest in keeping lines at polling places short. See\nBrief for Respondents in No. 07\u201325, p. 58. It warns that\n\u201c[i]f election workers\u2014a scarce resource in any election\u2014\nmust attend to the details of validating provisional ballots,\nvoters may have to wait longer to vote,\u201d and it assures us\nthat \u201c[n]othing deters voting so much as long lines at the\npolls.\u201d Ibid. But this argument fails on its own terms, for\nwhatever might be the number of individuals casting a\nprovisional ballot, the State could simply allow voters to\nsign the indigency affidavit at the polls subject to review\nthere after the election.33 After all, the Voter ID Law\nalready requires voters lacking photo identification to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  33 Florida has accommodated voters in this manner.      In Florida a\nvoter who casts a provisional ballot may have that vote counted if the\nvoter\u2019s signature on the provisional-ballot certification matches the\nsignature on the voter\u2019s registration. See Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7101.043,\n101.048. The voter is not required to make a second trip to have her\nprovisional ballot counted.\n26      CRAWFORD v.

What is more, as the Dis-\ntrict Court found, the Voter ID Law itself actually in-\ncreases the likelihood of delay at the polls. Since any\nminor discrepancy between a voter\u2019s photo identification\ncard and the registration information may lead to a chal-\nlenge, \u201cthe opportunities for presenting challenges ha[ve]\nincreased as a result of the photo identification require-\nments.\u201d Id., at 789; cf. 472 F. 3d, at 955 (Evans, J., dis-\nsenting) (\u201cThe potential for mischief with this law is obvi-\nous.

S. C.\n\u00a71973gg\u20136.\n   How any of this can justify restrictions on the right to\nvote is difficult to say. The State is simply trying to take\nadvantage of its own wrong: if it is true that the State\u2019s\nfear of in-person voter impersonation fraud arises from its\nbloated voter checklist, the answer to the problem is in the\nState\u2019s own hands. The claim that the State has an inter-\nest in addressing a symptom of the problem (alleged im-\npersonation) rather than the problem itself (the negli-\ngently maintained bloated rolls) is thus self-defeating; it\nshows that the State has no justifiable need to burden the\nright to vote as it does, and it suggests that the State is\nnot as serious about combating fraud as it claims to be.34\n   The State\u2019s final justification, its interest in safeguard-\ning voter confidence, similarly collapses. The problem\nwith claiming this interest lies in its connection to the\nbloated voter rolls; the State has come up with nothing to\nsuggest that its citizens doubt the integrity of the State\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  34 The voting-rolls argument also suggests that it would not be so\n\ndifficult to detect in-person voter fraud after all. If it is true that\npractitioners of fraud are most likely to vote in the name of registered\nvoters whom they know to have died or left the jurisdiction, then\nIndiana could simply audit its voting records to examine whether, and\nhow often, in-person votes were cast using these invalid registrations.\n28      CRAWFORD v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BD.\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nelectoral process, except its own failure to maintain its\nrolls. The answer to this problem is not to burden the\nright to vote, but to end the official negligence.\n   It should go without saying that none of this is to deny\nStates\u2019 legitimate interest in safeguarding public confi-\ndence. The Court has, for example, recognized that fight-\ning perceptions of political corruption stemming from large\npolitical contributions is a legitimate and substantial state\ninterest, underlying not only campaign finance laws, but\nbribery and antigratuity statutes as well. See Nixon v.\nShrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 390\n(2000). But the force of the interest depends on the facts\n(or plausibility of the assumptions) said to justify invoking\nit. See id., at 391 (\u201cThe quantum of empirical evidence\nneeded to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative\njudgments will vary up or down with the novelty and\nplausibility of the justification raised\u201d). While we found in\nNixon that \u201cthere is little reason to doubt that sometimes\nlarge contributions will work actual corruption of our\npolitical system, and no reason to question the existence of\na corresponding suspicion among voters,\u201d id., at 395, there\nis plenty of reason to be doubtful here, both about the\nreality and the perception. It is simply not plausible to\nassume here, with no evidence of in-person voter imper-\nsonation fraud in a State, and very little of it nationwide,\nthat a public perception of such fraud is nevertheless\n\u201cinherent\u201d in an election system providing severe criminal\npenalties for fraud and mandating signature checks at the\npolls. Cf. id., at 390 (\u201c[T]he perception of corruption [is]\n\u2018inherent in a regime of large individual financial contri-\nbutions\u2019 to candidates for public office\u201d (quoting Buckley v.\nValeo, 424 U.

The State\nrecognizes that tens of thousands of qualified voters lack\nthe necessary federally issued or state-issued identifica-\ntion, but it insists on implementing the requirement im-\nmediately, without allowing a transition period for tar-\ngeted efforts to distribute the required identification to\nindividuals who need it. The State hardly even tries to\nexplain its decision to force indigents or religious objectors\nto travel all the way to their county seats every time they\nwish to vote, and if there is any waning of confidence in\nthe administration of elections it probably owes more to\nthe State\u2019s violation of federal election law than to any\nimposters at the polling places. It is impossible to say, on\nthis record, that the State\u2019s interest in adopting its sig-\nnally inhibiting photo identification requirement has been\nshown to outweigh the serious burdens it imposes on the\nright to vote.\n   If more were needed to condemn this law, our own\nprecedent would provide it, for the calculation revealed in\nthe Indiana statute crosses a line when it targets the poor\nand the weak. Cf. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780,\n793 (1983) (\u201c[I]t is especially difficult for the State to\njustify a restriction that limits political participation by an\nidentifiable political group whose members share a par-\nticular viewpoint, associational preference, or economic\nstatus\u201d). If the Court\u2019s decision in Harper v. Virginia Bd.\nof Elections, 383 U. S. 663 (1966), stands for anything, it is\nthat being poor has nothing to do with being qualified to\nvote. Harper made clear that \u201c[t]o introduce wealth or\npayment of a fee as a measure of a voter\u2019s qualifications is\nto introduce a capricious or irrelevant factor.\u201d Id., at 668.\nThe State\u2019s requirements here, that people without cars\ntravel to a motor vehicle registry and that the poor who\nfail to do that get to their county seats within 10 days of\nevery election, likewise translate into unjustified economic\n30      CRAWFORD v.

Like that fee, the onus of the\nIndiana law is illegitimate just because it correlates with\nno state interest so well as it does with the object of deter-\nring poorer residents from exercising the franchise.\n                        *     *    *\n  The Indiana Voter ID Law is thus unconstitutional: the\nstate interests fail to justify the practical limitations\nplaced on the right to vote, and the law imposes an unrea-\nsonable and irrelevant burden on voters who are poor and\nold.

It imposes a burden upon\nsome voters, but it does so in order to prevent fraud, to\nbuild confidence in the voting system, and thereby to\nmaintain the integrity of the voting process. In determin-\ning whether this statute violates the Federal Constitution,\nI would balance the voting-related interests that the stat-\nute affects, asking \u201cwhether the statute burdens any one\nsuch interest in a manner out of proportion to the statute\u2019s\nsalutary effects upon the others (perhaps, but not neces-\nsarily, because of the existence of a clearly superior, less\nrestrictive alternative).\u201d Nixon v.

See Report of the Commission on Federal\nElection Reform, Building Confidence in U. S. Elections\n\u00a72.5 (Sept. 2005) (Carter-Baker Report), App. 136\u2013144.\nBecause the record does not discredit the Carter-Baker\nReport or suggest that Indiana is exceptional, I see noth-\ning to prevent Indiana\u2019s Legislature (or a federal court\nconsidering the constitutionality of the statute) from\ntaking account of the legislatively relevant facts the report\nsets forth and paying attention to its expert conclusions.\nThus, I share the general view of the lead opinion insofar\nas it holds that the Constitution does not automatically\nforbid Indiana from enacting a photo ID requirement.\nWere I also to believe, as JUSTICE STEVENS believes, that\nthe burden imposed by the Indiana statute on eligible\nvoters who lack photo IDs is indeterminate \u201con the basis of\nthe record that has been made in this litigation,\u201d ante, at\n18, or were I to believe, as JUSTICE SCALIA believes, that\nthe burden the statute imposes is \u201cminimal\u201d or \u201cjustified,\u201d\nante, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment), then I too\nwould reject the petitioners\u2019 facial attack, primarily for the\nreasons set forth in Part II of the lead opinion, see ante, at\n7\u201313.\n  I cannot agree, however, with JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 or\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s assessment of the burdens imposed by\nthe statute. The Carter-Baker Commission conditioned its\nrecommendation upon the States\u2019 willingness to ensure\nthat the requisite photo IDs \u201cbe easily available and is-\nsued free of charge\u201d and that the requirement be \u201cphased\nin\u201d over two federal election cycles, to ease the transition.\nCarter-Baker Report, at App. 139, 140.

See ante, at 6\u20137\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting) (noting that out of Indiana\u2019s 92\ncounties, 21 have no public transportation system at all\nand 32 others restrict public transportation to regional\ncounty service). For another, many of these individuals\nmay be uncertain about how to obtain the underlying\ndocumentation, usually a passport or a birth certificate,\nupon which the statute insists. And some may find the\ncosts associated with these documents unduly burdensome\n(up to $12 for a copy of a birth certificate; up to $100 for a\npassport). By way of comparison, this Court previously\nfound unconstitutionally burdensome a poll tax of $1.50\n(less than $10 today, inflation-adjusted). See Harper v.\nVirginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663, 664 n. 1, 666\n(1966); ante, at 30 (SOUTER, J., dissenting). Further,\nIndiana\u2019s exception for voters who cannot afford this cost\nimposes its own burden: a postelection trip to the county\nclerk or county election board to sign an indigency affida-\nvit after each election. See ante, at 8\u201310 (same).\n   By way of contrast, two other States\u2014Florida and Geor-\ngia\u2014have put into practice photo ID requirements signifi-\ncantly less restrictive than Indiana\u2019s. Under the Florida\nlaw, the range of permissible forms of photo ID is substan-\ntially greater than in Indiana. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7101.043(1)\n(West Supp. 2008) (including employee badge or ID, a\ndebit or credit card, a student ID, a retirement center ID,\na neighborhood association ID, and a public assistance\nID). Moreover, a Florida voter who lacks photo ID may\ncast a provisional ballot at the polling place that will be\n4       CRAWFORD v.

See Ga. Code Ann.\n\u00a721\u20132\u2013417 (Supp. 2007); Ga. Comp. Rules & Regs., Rule\n183\u20131\u201320.01 (2008) (permissible underlying documents\ninclude a paycheck stub, Social Security, Medicare, or\nMedicaid statement, school transcript, or federal affidavit\nof birth, as long as the document includes the voter\u2019s full\nname and date of birth). Moreover, a Federal District\nCourt found that Georgia \u201chas undertaken a serious,\nconcerted effort to notify voters who may lack Photo ID\ncards of the Photo ID requirement, to inform those voters\nof the availability of free [State-issued] Photo ID cards or\nfree Voter ID cards, to instruct the voters concerning how\nto obtain the cards, and to advise the voters that they can\nvote absentee by mail without a Photo ID.\u201d Common\nCause/Georgia v.

The\nCommission\u2019s findings, taken together with the considera-\ntions set forth in Part II of JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion, and\nPart II of JUSTICE SOUTER\u2019s dissenting opinion, lead me to\nthe conclusion that while the Constitution does not in\ngeneral forbid Indiana from enacting a photo ID require-\nment, this statute imposes a disproportionate burden upon\nthose without valid photo IDs.
