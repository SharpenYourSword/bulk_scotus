The question in this case is whether driving under the influence of alcohol is a \"violent felony\" as the Act defines it. We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Federal law prohibits a previously convicted felon from possessing a firearm. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000 ed.). A related provision provides for a prison term of up to 10 years for an ordinary offender. \u00a7 924(a)(2). The Armed Career Criminal Act imposes a more stringent 15-year mandatory minimum sentence on an offender who has three prior convictions \"for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\" \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>The Act defines a \"violent felony\" as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" that</p>\n<blockquote>\"(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.).</blockquote>\n<p>We here consider whether driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), as set forth in New Mexico's criminal statutes, falls within the scope of the second clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The relevant background circumstances include the following: In September 2004, New Mexico police officers received a report that Larry Begay, the petitioner here, had threatened his sister and aunt with a rifle. The police arrested him. Begay subsequently conceded he was a felon and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1584</span> pleaded guilty to a federal charge of unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1). Begay's presentence report said that he had been convicted a dozen times for DUI, which under New Mexico's law, becomes a felony (punishable by a prison term of more than one year) the fourth (or subsequent) time an individual commits it. See N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 66-8-102(G) to (J) (Supp.2007). The sentencing judge consequently found that Begay had at least three prior convictions for a crime \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" 377 F.Supp.2d 1141, 1143 (NM 2005). The judge also concluded that Begay's \"three felony DUI convictions involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1145. The judge consequently concluded that Begay had three or more prior convictions for a \"violent felony\" and should receive a sentence that reflected a mandatory minimum prison term of 15 years. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Begay, claiming that DUI is not a \"violent felony\" within the terms of the statute, appealed. The Court of Appeals panel by a vote of 2 to 1 rejected that claim. 470 F.3d 964 (C.A.10 2006). Begay sought certiorari, and we agreed to decide the question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>New Mexico's DUI statute makes it a crime (and a felony after three earlier convictions) to \"drive a vehicle within [the] state\" if the driver \"is under the influence of intoxicating liquor\" (or has an alcohol concentration of .08 or more in his blood or breath within three hours of having driven the vehicle resulting from \"alcohol consumed before or while driving the vehicle\"). \u00a7\u00a7 66-8-102(A), (C). In determining whether this crime is a violent felony, we consider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine it in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion. See <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (adopting this \"categorical approach\"); see also <i>James v. United States,</i> 550 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1597, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (attempted burglary is a violent felony even if, on <i>some</i> occasions, it can be committed in a way that poses no serious risk of physical harm).</p>\n<p>We also take as a given that DUI does not fall within the scope of the Act's <i>clause (i)</i> \"violent felony\" definition. DUI, as New Mexico defines it, nowhere \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>Finally, we assume that the lower courts were right in concluding that DUI involves conduct that \"presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Drunk driving is an extremely dangerous crime. In the United States in 2006, alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes claimed the lives of more than 17,000 individuals and harmed untold amounts of property. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., Traffic Safety Facts, 2006 Traffic Safety Annual Assessment\u0097Alcohol-Related Fatalities 1 (No. 810821, Aug. 2007), http://www-nrd.nhtsa. dot.gov/Pubs/810821.PDF (as visited Apr. 11, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Even so, we find that DUI falls outside the scope of clause (ii). It is simply too unlike the provision's listed examples for us to believe that Congress intended the provision to cover it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>In our view, the provision's listed examples\u0097burglary, arson, extortion, or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1585</span> crimes involving the use of explosives\u0097 illustrate the kinds of crimes that fall within the statute's scope. Their presence indicates that the statute covers only <i>similar</i> crimes, rather than <i>every</i> crime that \"presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). If Congress meant the latter, <i>i.e.,</i> if it meant the statute to be all-encompassing, it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all. Without them, clause (ii) would cover <i>all</i> crimes that present a \"serious potential risk of physical injury.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Additionally, if Congress meant clause (ii) to include <i>all</i> risky crimes, why would it have included clause (i)? A crime which has as an element the \"use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\" against the person (as clause (i) specifies) is likely to create \"a serious potential risk of physical injury\" and would seem to fall within the scope of clause (ii).</p>\n<p>Of course, Congress <i>might</i> have included the examples solely for quantitative purposes. Congress might have intended them to demonstrate no more than the degree of risk sufficient to bring a crime within the statute's scope. But were that the case, Congress would have likely chosen examples that better illustrated the \"degree of risk\" it had in mind. Our recent case, <i>James v. United States</i>\u0097where we considered only matters of degree, <i>i.e.,</i> whether the amount of risk posed by attempted burglary was comparable to the amount of risk posed by the example crime of burglary\u0097illustrates the difficulty of interpreting the examples in this respect. Compare 550 U.S., at ___ _ ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1594-1597, with <i>id.,</i> at ___, ___ _ ___, ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1601, 1603-1604, 1609 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Indeed, the examples are so far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses that it is difficult to accept clarification in respect to degree of risk as Congress' only reason for including them. See <i>id.,</i> at 1598-99 (\"Congress provided examples [that] ... have little in common, most especially with respect to the level of risk of physical injury that they pose\").</p>\n<p>These considerations taken together convince us that, \"`to give effect ... to every clause and word'\" of this statute, we should read the examples as limiting the crimes that clause (ii) covers to crimes that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves. <i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> 533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001) (quoting <i>United States v. Menasche,</i> 348 U.S. 528, 538-539, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955); some internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Leocal v. Ashcroft,</i> 543 U.S. 1, 12, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004) (describing the need to interpret a statute in a way that gives meaning to each word).</p>\n<p>The concurrence complains that our interpretive approach is insufficiently specific. See <i>post,</i> at 1589-1590 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). But the concurrence's own approach demands a crime-by-crime analysis, uses a standard of measurement (comparative degree of risk) that even the concurrence admits is often \"unclear,\" <i>post,</i> at 1590, requires the concurrence to turn here to the still less clear \"rule of lenity,\" <i>post,</i> at 1591, and, as we explain, is less likely to reflect Congress' intent. See, <i>e.g., post,</i> at 1590-1591 (recognizing inability to measure quantitative seriousness of risks associated with DUI).</p>\n<p>The statute's history offers further support for our conclusion that the examples in clause (ii) limit the scope of the clause to crimes that are similar to the examples themselves. Prior to the enactment of the current language, the Act applied its enhanced sentence to offenders with \"three <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1586</span> previous convictions for robbery or burglary.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 581, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (internal quotation marks omitted). Congress sought to expand that definition to include both crimes against the person (clause (i)) and certain physically risky crimes against property (clause (ii)). See H.R.Rep. No. 99-849, p. 3 (1986) (hereinafter H.R.Rep.). When doing so, Congress rejected a broad proposal that would have covered <i>every</i> offense that involved a substantial risk of the use of \"`physical force against the person or property of another.'\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 583, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (quoting S. 2312, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986); H.R. 4639, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986)). Instead, it added the present examples. And in the relevant House Report, it described clause (ii) as including \"State and Federal felonies against property such as burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives and <i>similar</i> crimes as predicate offenses where the conduct involved presents a serious risk of injury to a person.\" H.R. Rep., at 5 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Of course, the statute places the word \"otherwise,\" just after the examples, so that the provision covers a felony that is one of the example crimes \"or <i>otherwise</i> involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). But we cannot agree with the Government that the word \"otherwise\" is <i>sufficient</i> to demonstrate that the examples do not limit the scope of the clause. That is because the word \"otherwise\" <i>can</i> (we do not say <i>must,</i> cf. <i>post,</i> at 1589-1590 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)) refer to a crime that is similar to the listed examples in some respects but different in others\u0097similar say in respect to the degree of risk it produces, but different in respect to the \"way or manner\" in which it produces that risk. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1598 (1961) (defining \"otherwise\" to mean \"in a different way or manner\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>In our view, DUI differs from the example crimes\u0097burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives\u0097in at least one pertinent, and important, respect. The listed crimes all typically involve purposeful, \"violent,\" and \"aggressive\" conduct. 470 F.3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part); see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (\"burglary\" is an unlawful or unprivileged entry into a building or other structure with \"intent to commit a crime\"); ALI Model Penal Code \u00a7 220.1(1) (1985) (\"arson\" is causing a fire or explosion with the purpose of,\" <i>e.g.,</i> \"destroying a building... of another\" or \"damaging any property ... to collect insurance\"); <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 223.4 (extortion is \"purposely\" obtaining property of another through threat of, <i>e.g.,</i> inflicting \"bodily injury\"); <i>Leocal, supra,</i> at 9, 125 S.Ct. 377 (the word \"`use' ... most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct\" which fact helps bring it outside the scope of the statutory term \"crime of violence\"). That conduct is such that it makes more likely that an offender, later possessing a gun, will use that gun deliberately to harm a victim. Crimes committed in such a purposeful, violent, and aggressive manner are \"potentially more dangerous when firearms are involved.\" 470 F.3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part). And such crimes are \"characteristic of the armed career criminal, the eponym of the statute.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>By way of contrast, statutes that forbid driving under the influence, such as the statute before us, typically do not insist on purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct; rather, they are, or are most nearly comparable to, crimes that impose strict liability, criminalizing conduct in respect to which the offender need not have had any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1587</span> criminal intent at all. The Government argues that \"the knowing nature of the conduct that produces intoxication combined with the inherent recklessness of the ensuing conduct more than suffices\" to create an element of intent. Brief for United States 35. And we agree with the Government that a drunk driver may very well drink on purpose. But this Court has said that, unlike the example crimes, the conduct for which the drunk driver is convicted (driving under the influence) need not be purposeful or deliberate. See <i>Leocal,</i> 543 U.S., at 11, 125 S.Ct. 377 (a DUI offense involves \"accidental or negligent conduct\"); see also 470 F.3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part) (\"[D]runk driving is a crime of negligence or recklessness, rather than violence or aggression\").</p>\n<p>When viewed in terms of the Act's basic purposes, this distinction matters considerably. As suggested by its title, the Armed Career Criminal Act focuses upon the special danger created when a particular type of offender\u0097a violent criminal or drug trafficker\u0097possesses a gun. See <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 587-588, 110 S.Ct. 2143; 470 F.3d, at 981, n. 3 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part) (\"[T]he title [of the Act] was not merely decorative\"). In order to determine which offenders fall into this category, the Act looks to past crimes. This is because an offender's criminal history is relevant to the question whether he is a career criminal, or, more precisely, to the kind or degree of danger the offender would pose were he to possess a gun.</p>\n<p>In this respect\u0097namely, a prior crime's relevance to the possibility of future danger with a gun\u0097crimes involving intentional or purposeful conduct (as in burglary and arson) are different than DUI, a strict liability crime. In both instances, the offender's prior crimes reveal a degree of callousness toward risk, but in the former instance they also show an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger. We have no reason to believe that Congress intended a 15-year mandatory prison term where that increased likelihood does not exist.</p>\n<p>Were we to read the statute without this distinction, its 15-year mandatory minimum sentence would apply to a host of crimes which, though dangerous, are not typically committed by those whom one normally labels \"armed career criminals.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> Ark.Code Ann. \u00a7 8-4-103(a)(2)(A)(ii) (2007) (reckless polluters); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(c)(1) (individuals who negligently introduce pollutants into the sewer system); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(a) (individuals who recklessly tamper with consumer products); \u00a7 1115 (seamen whose inattention to duty causes serious accidents). We have no reason to believe that Congress intended to bring within the statute's scope these kinds of crimes, far removed as they are from the deliberate kind of behavior associated with violent criminal use of firearms. The statute's use of examples (and the other considerations we have mentioned) indicate the contrary.</p>\n<p>The dissent's approach, on the other hand, would likely include these crimes within the statutory definition of \"violent felony,\" along with any other crime that can be said to present \"a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1592 (opinion of ALITO, J.). And it would do so because it believes such a result is compelled by the statute's text. See <i>ibid.</i> But the dissent's explanation does not account for a key feature of that text\u0097 namely, the four example crimes intended to illustrate what kind of \"violent felony\" the statute covers. The dissent at most believes that these examples are relevant only to define the \"requisite\" serious risk associated with a \"crime of violence.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1588</span> <i>Post,</i> at 1595. But the dissent does not explain what it means by \"requisite,\" nor does it describe how these various examples might help define that term in the context of this statute. If they were in fact helpful on that score, we might expect more predictable results from a purely risk-based approach. Compare <i>post,</i> at 1588, 1591-1592 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment), with <i>post,</i> at 1592-1594 (dissenting opinion). Thus, the dissent's reliance on these examples for a function they appear incapable of performing reads them out of the statute and, in so doing, fails to effectuate Congress' purpose to punish only a particular subset of offender, namely career criminals.</p>\n<p>The distinction we make does not minimize the seriousness of the risks attached to driving under the influence. Nor does our argument deny that an individual with a criminal history of DUI might later pull the trigger of a gun. (Indeed, we may have such an instance before us. 470 F.3d, at 965.) Rather, we hold only that, for purposes of the particular statutory provision before us, a prior record of DUI, a strict liability crime, differs from a prior record of violent and aggressive crimes committed intentionally such as arson, burglary, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives. The latter are associated with a likelihood of future violent, aggressive, and purposeful \"armed career criminal\" behavior in a way that the former are not.</p>\n<p>We consequently conclude that New Mexico's crime of \"driving under the influence\" falls outside the scope of the Armed Career Criminal Act's clause (ii) \"violent felony\" definition. And we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in relevant part and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>The statute in this case defines \"violent felony\" in part as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Contrary to the Court, I conclude that the residual clause unambiguously encompasses <i>all</i> crimes that present a serious risk of injury to another. But because I cannot say that drunk driving clearly poses such a risk (within the meaning of the statute), the rule of lenity brings me to concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Last Term, in <i>James v. United States,</i> 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (2007), the Court held that attempted burglary qualifies as a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e). It concluded that to determine whether a predicate crime falls under the residual clause, a court should first identify the enumerated crime to which the predicate crime is most closely analogous and then decide whether the risk posed by the predicate crime is roughly equivalent to the risk posed by the enumerated crime. Because burglary was the enumerated crime most closely analogous to attempted burglary, and attempted burglary in the Court's judgment posed roughly the same risk of physical injury as burglary, attempted burglary qualified as a \"violent felony\" under \u00a7 924(e). See <i>id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1597.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Court's approach in deciding that case provided no guidance for deciding future cases that involve predicate crimes other than attempted burglary, particularly those for which there are no clear analogs among the enumerated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1589</span> crimes. Pointing out that problem in dissent, I anticipated this very case: \"Is, for example, driving under the influence of alcohol more analogous to burglary, arson, extortion, or a crime involving use of explosives?\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1601.</p>\n<p>My dissent set out a different approach to the statute. In my view, the best way to interpret \u00a7 924(e) is first to determine which of the enumerated offenses poses the least serious risk of physical injury, and then to set that level of risk as the \"serious potential risk\" required by the statute. Crimes that pose at least that serious a risk of injury are encompassed by the residual clause; crimes that do not are excluded. In my judgment, burglary was the least risky crime among the enumerated offenses, and I therefore concluded that attempted burglary, which is less risky than burglary, is not covered by the residual clause.</p>\n<p>The Court held otherwise in <i>James,</i> and since this is a statutory case that holding has a strong claim to <i>stare decisis.</i> But the concomitant of the sad fact that the theory of <i>James</i> has very limited application is the happy fact that its <i>stare decisis</i> effect is very limited as well. It must be followed, I presume, for unenumerated crimes that are analogous to enumerated crimes (<i>e.g.,</i> attempted arson). It provides no answer, and suggests no approach to an answer, where, as here, the predicate crime has no analog among the enumerated crimes. For such cases I would therefore adhere to the principles I set forth in my <i>James</i> dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Today the Court devises a different way to give concrete meaning to the residual clause. Confronted with a predicate crime that has no obvious analog among the enumerated offenses, the Court engrafts a requirement onto the residual clause that a predicate crime involve \"purposeful, `violent,' and `aggressive' conduct.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1586. By doing so, it excludes a slew of crimes from the scope of the residual clause, including (not by happenstance) the crime at issue here, drunk driving. Like <i>James,</i> this latest made-for-the-case improvisation does not (as my resolution does) provide a complete framework that will embrace all future cases. There are still many crimes that are not analogous to the enumerated crimes (so that their status cannot be resolved by <i>James</i>) but do involve \"purposeful, `violent,' and `aggressive' conduct\" (so that their status cannot be resolved by today's <i>deus ex machina</i>). Presumably some third (and perhaps fourth and fifth) gimmick will be devised to resolve those cases as they arise, leaving our brethren on the district courts and courts of appeals much room for enjoyable speculation.</p>\n<p>But quite apart from its regrettable continuation of a piecemeal, suspenseful, Scrabble-like approach to the interpretation of this statute, the problem with the Court's holding today is that it is not remotely faithful to the statute that Congress wrote. There is simply no basis (other than the necessity of resolving the present case) for holding that the enumerated and unenumerated crimes must be similar in respects <i>other than the degree of risk that they pose.</i></p>\n<p>The Court is correct that the clause \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" signifies a similarity between the enumerated and unenumerated crimes. It is not, however, <i>any</i> old similarity, such as (to take a random example) \"purposeful, `violent,' and `aggressive' conduct.\" Rather, it is the <i>particular</i> similarity specified after the \"otherwise\"\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> that they all pose a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. They need not be similar <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1590</span> in any other way. As the Court correctly notes, the word \"otherwise\" in this context means \"`in a different way or manner.' \" <i>Ante,</i> at 1587; see also <i>James,</i> 550 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1602 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); Webster's New International Dictionary 1729 (2d ed.1957) (\"in another way or in other ways\"). Therefore, by using the word \"otherwise\" the writer draws a substantive connection between two sets only on one specific dimension\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> whatever follows \"otherwise.\" What that means here is that \"committing one of the enumerated crimes ... is <i>one way</i> to commit a crime `involv[ing] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another'; and that <i>other ways</i> of committing a crime of that character similarly constitute `violent felon[ies].'\" <i>James, supra,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1603 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The Court rejects this seemingly straightforward statutory analysis, reading the residual clause to mean that the unenumerated offenses must be similar to the enumerated offenses not only in the degree of risk they pose, but also \"in kind,\" despite the fact that \"otherwise\" means that the <i>common</i> element of risk must be presented \"`in a <i>different</i> way or manner.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1585-1586 (emphasis added). The Court's explanation for this interpretation seems to be that the enumerated crimes are \"so far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses that it is difficult to accept clarification in respect to degree of risk as Congress's only reason for including them.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1585. While I certainly agree that the degree of risk associated with the enumerated crimes is unclear, I find it unthinkable that the solution to that problem is to write a different statute. The phrase \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" limits inclusion in the statute only by a crime's degree of risk. See <i>James, supra,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1603 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The use of the adjective \"serious\" seems to me to signify a purely quantitative measure of risk. If both an intentional and a negligent crime pose a 50% risk of death, could one be characterized as involving a \"serious risk\" and the other not? Surely not.</p>\n<p>The Court supports its argument with that ever-ready refuge from the hardships of statutory text, the (judicially) perceived statutory purpose. According to the Court, because the Armed Career Criminal Act is concerned with \"the special danger created when a particular type of offender\u0097a violent criminal or drug trafficker\u0097possesses a gun,\" the statutory purpose favors applying \u00a7 924(e)'s enhanced penalty only to those criminals \"who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1587. I cannot possibly infer that purpose from the statute. For all I know, the statute was meant to punish those who are indifferent to human life, or who are undeterred by the criminal penalties attached to the commission of other crimes (after all, the statute enhances penalties for drug traffickers, see \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)). While the Court's asserted purpose would surely be a reasonable one, it has no more grounding in the statutory text than do these other possibilities. And what is more, the Court's posited purpose is positively contradicted by the fact that one of the enumerated crimes\u0097the unlawful use of explosives\u0097may involve merely negligent or reckless conduct. See ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 220.2(2) (1985) (\"A person is guilty of a misdemeanor if he recklessly creates a risk of catastrophe in the employment of fire, explosives or other dangerous means\"); <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 220.3 (\"A person is guilty of criminal mischief if he ... damages tangible property of another purposely, recklessly, or by negligence in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1591</span> employment of fire, explosives, or other dangerous means\").</p>\n<p>The Court says that an interpretation of the residual clause that includes all crimes posing a serious risk of injury would render superfluous \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), which provides that a \"violent felony\" is any crime that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person\" of another. <i>Ante,</i> at 1584 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the canon against surplusage has substantially less force when it comes to interpreting a broad residual clause like the one at issue here. Though the second clause renders the first superfluous, it would raise no eyebrows to refer to \"crimes that entail the use of force and crimes that, while not entailing the use of force, nonetheless present a serious risk of injury to another person.\" In any event, the canon against surplusage merely helps decide between competing permissible interpretations of an ambiguous statute; it does not sanction writing in a requirement that Congress neglected to think of. And finally, come to think of it, the Court's solution does nothing whatever to solve the supposed surplusage problem. Crimes that include as an element \"the use ... of physical force against the person of another\" are all embraced (and the reference to them thus rendered superfluous) by the requirement of \"purposeful, `violent,' and `aggressive' conduct\" that the Court invents.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Under my interpretation of \u00a7 924(e), I must answer one question: Does drunk driving pose at least as serious a risk of physical injury to another as burglary? From the evidence presented by the Government, I cannot conclude so. Because of that, the rule of lenity requires that I resolve this case in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p>The Government cites the fact that in 2006, 17,062 persons died from alcohol-related car crashes, and that 15,121 of those deaths involved drivers with blood-alcohol concentrations of 0.08 or higher. See Brief for United States 17. Drunk driving is surely a national problem of great concern. But the fact that it kills many people each year tells us very little about whether a single act of drunk driving \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" It may well be that an even greater number of deaths occurs annually to pedestrians crossing the street; but that hardly means that crossing the street presents a serious potential risk of injury. Where the issue is \"risk,\" the annual number of injuries from an activity must be compared with the annual incidents of the activity. Otherwise drunk driving could be said to pose a more serious risk of physical harm than murder. In addition, drunk driving is a combination of two activities: (1) drinking and (2) driving. If driving alone results in injury in a certain percentage of cases, it could hardly be said that the entirety of the risk posed by drunk driving can be attributed to the combination. And finally, injuries to the drunk drivers themselves must be excluded from the calculus, because the statute counts only injuries to other persons.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, we do not have these relevant statistics. And even if we did, we would still need to know similar statistics for burglary, which are probably even harder to come by. This does not mean that I will never be able to identify a crime that falls under the residual clause. For some crimes, the severity of the risk will be obvious. Crimes like negligent homicide, see ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 210.4 (1980), conspiracy to commit a violent crime, <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 5.03 (1985), inciting to riot, 18 U.S.C. \u00a72101, and the production of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1592</span> chemical weapons, \u00a7 229, certainly pose a more serious risk of physical injury to others than burglary. (By contrast, the Court's approach eliminates from the residual clause all negligent crimes, even those that entail a 100% risk of physical injury such as negligent homicide.) But I can do no more than guess as to whether drunk driving poses a more serious risk than burglary, and I will not condemn a man to a minimum of 15 years in prison on the basis of such speculation. See <i>Ladner v. United States,</i> 358 U.S. 169, 178, 79 S.Ct. 209, 3 L.Ed.2d 199 (1958). Applying the rule of lenity to a statute that demands it, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, with whom Justice SOUTER and Justice THOMAS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The statutory provision at issue in this case\u0097the so-called \"residual clause\" of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u0097calls out for legislative clarification, and I am sympathetic to the result produced by the Court's attempt to craft a narrowing construction of this provision. Unfortunately, the Court's interpretation simply cannot be reconciled with the statutory text, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>In September 2004, after a night of heavy drinking, petitioner pointed a rifle at his aunt and threatened to shoot if she did not give him money. When she replied that she did not have any money, petitioner repeatedly pulled the trigger, but the rifle was unloaded and did not fire. Petitioner then threatened his sister in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>At the time of this incident, petitioner was a convicted felon. He had 12 prior convictions in New Mexico for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). While DUI is generally a misdemeanor under New Mexico law, the offense of DUI after at least three prior DUI convictions is a felony requiring a sentence of 18 months' imprisonment. N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 66-8-102(G) (Supp.2007).</p>\n<p>Petitioner pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). A violation of that provision generally carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years, see \u00a7 924(a)(2), but the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that petitioner was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years because he had at least three prior convictions for the New Mexico felony of DUI after being convicted of DUI on at least three prior occasions. 377 F.Supp.2d 1141, 1143-45 (NM 2005); 470 F.3d 964, 966-975, 977 (C.A.10 2006). The lower courts concluded that these offenses were crimes \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" and \"involve[d] conduct that present[ed] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>The Court does not hold that the maximum term of imprisonment that petitioner faced on his felony DUI convictions was less than one year.<sup>[1]</sup> Nor does the Court dispute that petitioner's offenses involved \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The only remaining question, therefore, is whether the risk presented by petitioner's qualifying DUI felony convictions was \"serious,\" <i>i.e.,</i> \"significant\" or \"important.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> Webster's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1593</span> Third New International Dictionary 2073 (hereinafter Webster's); (2002) 15 Oxford English Dictionary 15 (def. 6(a)) (2d ed.1989) (hereinafter OED). In my view, it was.</p>\n<p>Statistics dramatically show that driving under the influence of alcohol is very dangerous. Each year, approximately 15,000 fatal alcohol-related crashes occur, accounting for roughly 40% of all fatal crashes.<sup>[2]</sup> Approximately a quarter million people are injured annually in alcohol-related crashes.<sup>[3]</sup> The number of people who are killed each year by drunk drivers is far greater than the number of murders committed during any of the crimes specifically set out in the statutory provision at issue here, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u0097burglary, arson, extortion, and offenses involving the use of explosives.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Petitioner's qualifying offenses, moreover, fell within the statute only because he had been convicted of DUI on at least three prior occasions. As noted, petitioner had <i>a dozen</i> prior DUI convictions. Persons who repeatedly drive drunk present a greatly enhanced danger that they and others will be injured as a result.<sup>[5]</sup> In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1594</span> addition, it has been estimated that the ratio of DUI incidents to DUI arrests is between 250 to 1 and 2,000 to 1.<sup>[6]</sup> Accordingly, the risk presented by a 10th, 11th, and 12th DUI conviction may be viewed as the risk created by literally thousands of drunk-driving events. That risk was surely \"serious,\" and therefore petitioner's offenses fell squarely within the language of the statute.</p>\n<p>Moreover, taking the statutory language to mean what it says would not sweep in all DUI convictions. Most DUI convictions are not punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year and thus fall outside the scope of the statute.<sup>[7]</sup> Petitioner's convictions qualified only because of his extraordinary\u0097and, I would say, extraordinarily dangerous\u0097record of drunk driving.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that an offense does not fall within the residual clause unless it is \"roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risked posed,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1585, to the crimes specifically listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), <i>i.e.,</i> burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving the use of explosives. These crimes, according to the Court, \"all typically involve purposeful, `violent,' and `aggressive' conduct.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1586 (quoting 470 F.3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p>This interpretation cannot be squared with the text of the statute, which simply does not provide that an offense must be \"purposeful,\" \"violent,\" or \"aggressive\" in order to fall within the residual clause. Rather, after listing burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives offenses, the statute provides (in the residual clause) that an offense qualifies if it \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" Therefore, offenses falling within the residual clause must be similar to the named offenses in one respect only: They must, \"otherwise\"\u0097which is to say, \"in a different manner,\" 10 OED 984 (def. B(1)); see also Webster's 1598\u0097\"involve[] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" Requiring that an offense must also be \"purposeful,\" \"violent,\" or \"aggressive\" amounts to adding new elements to the statute, but we \"ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.\" <i>Bates v. United States,</i> 522 U.S. 23, 29, 118 S.Ct. 285, 139 L.Ed.2d 215 (1997).</p>\n<p>Each part of this additional, judicially added requirement presents other problems as well.</p>\n<p><i>Purposeful.</i> At least one State's DUI law requires proof of purposeful conduct. See <i>Tam v. State,</i> 232 Ga.App. 15, 16, 501 S.E.2d 51, 52 (1998) (requiring proof of the intent to drive). In addition, many States recognize involuntary intoxication as a defense. See 4 R. Essen &amp; R. Erwin, Defense of Drunk Driving Cases: Criminal\u0097 Civil \u00a7 44.04 (2007). And even in States that do not require purposefulness, I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of DUI defendants purposefully drank before getting behind the wheel and were purposefully operating their vehicles at the time of apprehension. I suspect that many DUI statutes do not require proof of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1595</span> purposefulness because the element is almost always present, requiring proof of the element would introduce an unnecessary complication, and it would make no sense to preclude conviction of those defendants who were so drunk that they did not even realize that they were behind the wheel.</p>\n<p><i>Violent.</i> It is clear that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) is not limited to \"violent\" crimes, for if it were, it would be redundant. The prior subparagraph, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A), includes offenses that have as an element the use or threatened use of violence.</p>\n<p><i>Aggressive.</i> The concept of \"aggressive\" crimes is vague, and in any event, it is hardly apparent why DUI\u0097not to mention the species of felony DUI recidivism that resulted in petitioner's predicament\u0097is not \"aggressive.\" Driving can certainly involve \"aggressive\" conduct. Indeed, some States have created the offense of \"aggressive driving.\" See M. Savage, M. Sundeen, &amp; A. Teigen, Traffic Safety and Public Health: State Legislative Action 2007, Transportation Series (National Conference of State Legislatures, Dec. 2007, No. 32), p. 17, and App. J, online at http:// www.ncsl.org/print/transportation/07traffic safety.pdf. Most States have a toll-free telephone number to call to report \"aggressive\" driving. See Campaign Safe &amp; Sober, Phone Numbers for Reporting Impaired, Aggressive, or Unsafe Driving, online at http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/ outreach/safesobr/16qp/phone.html.</p>\n<p>The Court defends its new statutory element on the ground that a defendant who merely engages in felony drunk driving is not likely to be \"the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1587. The Court cites no empirical support for this conclusion, and its accuracy is not self-evident. Petitioner's pattern of behavior may or may not be typical of those defendants who have enough DUI convictions to qualify under N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 66-8-102(G) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), but the example of his behavior in this case\u0097pointing a gun at his aunt's head and repeatedly pulling the trigger\u0097should surely be enough to counsel against uncritical reliance on stereotypes about \"the type\" of people who commit felony DUI violations.</p>\n<p>Defendants who qualify for an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) based (in whole or in part) on felony DUI convictions share at least three characteristics that are relevant for present purposes. First, they are persons who, in the judgment of Congress, cannot be trusted to use a firearm responsibly. In order to qualify for an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e), a defendant must of course be convicted of violating the felon-in-possession statute, \u00a7 922(g) (2000 ed.). The felon-in-possession statute necessarily rests on the judgment that a person with a prior felony conviction cannot be trusted with a firearm. See <i>Caron v. United States,</i> 524 U.S. 308, 315, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (1998) (\"Congress meant to keep guns away from all offenders who, the Federal Government feared, might cause harm ...\"). And there is no dispute that a prior felony DUI conviction qualifies as a felony under the felon-in-possession law. If Congress thought that a person with a prior felony DUI conviction is not \"the kind of person\" who is likely to use a gun unlawfully, why would Congress have made it a crime for such a person to possess a gun?</p>\n<p>Second, defendants with DUI convictions that are counted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) are likely to have serious alcohol abuse problems. As previously mentioned, ordinary DUI convictions are generally not counted under \u00a7 924(e) because they are not punishable by imprisonment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1596</span> for more than a year. Such penalties are generally reserved for persons, like petitioner, with a record of repeated DUI violations. See National Conference of State Legislatures, <i>supra.</i> Such individuals are very likely to have serious alcohol abuse problems and a propensity to engage in irresponsible conduct while under the influence. Alcohol use often precedes violent crimes, see, <i>e.g.,</i> Roizen, Epidemiological Issues in Alcohol-Related Violence, in 13 Recent Developments in Alcoholism 7, 8-9 (M. Galanter ed.1997), and thus there is reason to worry about the misuse of firearms by defendants whose alcohol abuse problems are serious enough to result in felony DUI convictions.</p>\n<p>Third, defendants with DUI convictions that are counted under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) have either (a) such serious alcohol abuse problems that they have at least three prior felony DUI convictions or (b) both one or two felony DUI convictions and one or two offenses that fall under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) (offenses that have \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\") or that are specifically set out in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (burglary, arson, extortion, or an explosives offense). Defendants with three felony DUI convictions are likely to be super-DUI-recidivists like petitioner. Defendants with a combination of felony DUI and other qualifying convictions\u0097for example, convictions for assault or burglary\u0097are persons who, even by the Court's lights, could be classified as \"the kind of person who might deliberately point [a] gun and pull the trigger.\"</p>\n<p>Unlike the Court, I cannot say that persons with these characteristics are less likely to use a gun illegally than are persons convicted of other qualifying felonies.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA's concurrence takes a different approach, but his analysis is likewise flawed. Justice SCALIA would hold (a) that an offense does not fall within the residual clause unless it presents a risk that is at least as great as that presented by the least dangerous of the enumerated offenses; (b) that burglary is the least dangerous of the enumerated offenses; (c) that the relevant measure of risk is the risk that the typical burglary, DUI, etc. would result in injury; and (d) that the risk presented by an incident of DUI is less than the risk presented by a burglary.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, like the Court, does not follow the statutory language. The statute says that offenses falling within the residual clause must present \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" The statute does not say that these offenses must present at least as much risk as the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p>The statute also does not say, as Justice SCALIA would hold, that the relevant risk is the risk that each incident of DUI will result in injury. I see no basis for concluding that Congress was not also concerned with the risk faced by potential victims, particularly since the statute explicitly refers to \"potential risk.\" Drunk driving is regarded as a severe societal problem in large measure because of the very large number of victims it produces each year.</p>\n<p>Finally, Justice SCALIA's conclusion that burglary is the least risky of the enumerated offenses is based on a procrustean reading of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This provision refers, without qualification, to \"extortion.\" In his dissent in <i>James v. United States,</i> 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (2007), Justice SCALIA concluded that many forms of extortion are \"inherently <i>unlikely</i> to cause physical harm.\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1594-95 (emphasis in original). Only by finding that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1597</span> term \"extortion\" in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) really means only certain forms of extortion was Justice SCALIA able to come to the conclusion that burglary is the least risky of the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p>For all these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Tenth Circuit.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  <i>United States v. Gonzaga Rodriquez,</i> now pending before the Court, presents the question \"[w]hether a state drug-trafficking offense, for which state law authorized a ten-year sentence because the defendant was a recidivist, qualifies as a predicate offense under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).\" Pet. for Cert., O.T.2007, No. 06-1646, p.

While murders committed in the course of extortion were not separately reported, common sense and the fact that the total number of murders was similar to the number of fatal alcohol-related crashes at least after 1997 indicates that murders involving extortion would not rival deaths in alcohol-related auto accidents.

Pp. 3\u201310.\n    (a) Whether a crime is a violent felony is determined by how the\n law defines it and not how an individual offender might have com-\n mitted it on a particular occasion. Pp. 3\u20134.\n    (b) Even assuming that DUI involves conduct that \u201cpresents a seri-\n ous potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d under clause (ii), the\n crime falls outside the clause\u2019s scope because it is simply too unlike\n clause (ii)\u2019s example crimes to indicate that Congress intended that\n provision to cover it. Pp. 4\u201310.\n2                       BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n         (i) Clause (ii)\u2019s listed examples\u2014burglary, arson, extortion, and\n    crimes involving the use of explosives\u2014should be read as limiting the\n    crimes the clause covers to those that are roughly similar, in kind as\n    well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves. Their\n    presence in the statute indicates that Congress meant for the statute\n    to cover only similar crimes, rather than every crime that \u201cpresents a\n    serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n    If Congress meant the statute to be all encompassing, it would not\n    have needed to include the examples at all. Moreover, if clause (ii)\n    were meant to include all risky crimes, Congress likely would not\n    have included clause (i), which includes crimes that have \u201cas an ele-\n    ment the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\n    against the person of another.\u201d And had Congress included the ex-\n    amples solely for quantitative purposes, demonstrating no more than\n    the degree of risk of physical injury sufficient to bring a crime within\n    the statute\u2019s scope, it would likely have chosen examples that better\n    illustrated the degree of risk it had in mind rather than these that\n    are far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses. The\n    Government\u2019s argument that the word \u201cotherwise\u201d just after the ex-\n    amples is sufficient to demonstrate that they do not limit the clause\u2019s\n    scope is rejected because \u201cotherwise\u201d can refer to a crime that is, e.g.,\n    similar to the examples in respect to the degree of risk it produces,\n    but different in respect to the way or manner in which it produces\n    that risk. Pp. 4\u20137.\n         (ii) DUI differs from the example crimes in at least one impor-\n    tant respect: The examples typically involve purposeful, violent, and\n    aggressive conduct, whereas DUI statutes typically do not. When\n    viewed in terms of the Act\u2019s purposes, this distinction matters con-\n    siderably. The Act looks to past crimes to determine which offenders\n    create a special danger by possessing a gun. In this respect, a history\n    of crimes involving purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct, which\n    shows an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person\n    who might deliberately point a gun and pull the trigger, is different\n    from a history of DUI, which does not involve the deliberate kind of\n    behavior associated with violent criminal use of firearms.

S. C. \u00a7924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp.\nV). The question in this case is whether driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as the Act defines\nit. We conclude that it is not.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n  Federal law prohibits a previously convicted felon from\npossessing a firearm. \u00a7922(g)(1) (2000 ed.). A related\nprovision provides for a prison term of up to 10 years for\nan ordinary offender. \u00a7924(a)(2). The Armed Career\nCriminal Act imposes a more stringent 15-year mandatory\nminimum sentence on an offender who has three prior\nconvictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).\n  The Act defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime punish-\nable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that\n    \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n2                BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    threatened use of physical force against the person of\n    another; or\n    \u201c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\n    explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre-\n    sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an-\n    other.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.).\nWe here consider whether driving under the influence of\nalcohol (DUI), as set forth in New Mexico\u2019s criminal stat-\nutes, falls within the scope of the second clause.\n                             B\n   The relevant background circumstances include the\nfollowing: In September 2004, New Mexico police officers\nreceived a report that Larry Begay, the petitioner here,\nhad threatened his sister and aunt with a rifle. The police\narrested him. Begay subsequently conceded he was a\nfelon and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of unlawful\npossession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7922(g)(1). Begay\u2019s\npresentence report said that he had been convicted a\ndozen times for DUI, which under New Mexico\u2019s law,\nbecomes a felony (punishable by a prison term of more\nthan one year) the fourth (or subsequent) time an individ-\nual commits it. See N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a766\u20138\u2013102(G) to (J)\n(Supp. 2007). The sentencing judge consequently found\nthat Begay had at least three prior convictions for a crime\n\u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one\nyear.\u201d 377 F. Supp. 2d 1141, 1143 (NM 2005). The judge\nalso concluded that Begay\u2019s \u201cthree felony DUI convictions\ninvolve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another.\u201d Id., at 1145. The judge con-\nsequently concluded that Begay had three or more prior\nconvictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d and should receive a\nsentence that reflected a mandatory minimum prison term\nof 15 years. Ibid.\n   Begay, claiming that DUI is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within\nthe terms of the statute, appealed. The Court of Appeals\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npanel by a vote of 2 to 1 rejected that claim. 470 F. 3d 964\n(CA10 2006). Begay sought certiorari, and we agreed to\ndecide the question.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   New Mexico\u2019s DUI statute makes it a crime (and a\nfelony after three earlier convictions) to \u201cdrive a vehicle\nwithin [the] state\u201d if the driver \u201cis under the influence of\nintoxicating liquor\u201d (or has an alcohol concentration of .08\nor more in his blood or breath within three hours of having\ndriven the vehicle resulting from \u201calcohol consumed before\nor while driving the vehicle\u201d). \u00a7\u00a766\u20138\u2013102(A), (C). In\ndetermining whether this crime is a violent felony, we\nconsider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine\nit in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in\nterms of how an individual offender might have committed\nit on a particular occasion. See Taylor v. United States,\n495 U. S. 575, 602 (1990) (adopting this \u201ccategorical ap-\nproach\u201d); see also James v. United States, 550 U. S. ___ ,\n___ (2007) (slip op., at 14\u201315) (attempted burglary is a\nviolent felony even if, on some occasions, it can be commit-\nted in a way that poses no serious risk of physical harm).\n   We also take as a given that DUI does not fall within\nthe scope of the Act\u2019s clause (i) \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition.\nDUI, as New Mexico defines it, nowhere \u201chas as an ele-\nment the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\nforce against the person of another.\u201d             18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i).\n   Finally, we assume that the lower courts were right in\nconcluding that DUI involves conduct that \u201cpresents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Drunk driving is an extremely dangerous\ncrime. In the United States in 2006, alcohol-related motor\nvehicle crashes claimed the lives of more than 17,000\nindividuals and harmed untold amounts of property.\n4                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Admin., Traffic Safety\nFacts, 2006 Traffic Safety Annual Assessment\u2014Alcohol-\nRelated Fatalities 1 (No. 810821, Aug. 2007), http://www-\nnrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/810821.PDF (as visited Apr. 11,\n2008, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Even so,\nwe find that DUI falls outside the scope of clause (ii). It is\nsimply too unlike the provision\u2019s listed examples for us to\nbelieve that Congress intended the provision to cover it.\n                               B\n                               1\n   In our view, the provision\u2019s listed examples\u2014burglary,\narson, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explo-\nsives\u2014illustrate the kinds of crimes that fall within the\nstatute\u2019s scope. Their presence indicates that the statute\ncovers only similar crimes, rather than every crime that\n\u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). If Congress meant the latter,\ni.e., if it meant the statute to be all-encompassing, it is\nhard to see why it would have needed to include the ex-\namples at all. Without them, clause (ii) would cover all\ncrimes that present a \u201cserious potential risk of physical\ninjury.\u201d Ibid. Additionally, if Congress meant clause (ii)\nto include all risky crimes, why would it have included\nclause (i)? A crime which has as an element the \u201cuse,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d against\nthe person (as clause (i) specifies) is likely to create \u201ca\nserious potential risk of physical injury\u201d and would seem\nto fall within the scope of clause (ii).\n   Of course, Congress might have included the examples\nsolely for quantitative purposes. Congress might have\nintended them to demonstrate no more than the degree of\nrisk sufficient to bring a crime within the statute\u2019s scope.\nBut were that the case, Congress would have likely chosen\nexamples that better illustrated the \u201cdegree of risk\u201d it had\nin mind. Our recent case, James v. United States\u2014where\n                   Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)              5\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwe considered only matters of degree, i.e., whether the\namount of risk posed by attempted burglary was compara-\nble to the amount of risk posed by the example crime of\nburglary\u2014illustrates the difficulty of interpreting the\nexamples in this respect. Compare 550 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9\u201313), with id., at ___ (slip op., at 2, 5\u20136, 16\u201317)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Indeed, the examples are so far\nfrom clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses that\nit is difficult to accept clarification in respect to degree of\nrisk as Congress\u2019 only reason for including them. See id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 16\u201317) (\u201cCongress provided examples\n[that] . . . have little in common, most especially with\nrespect to the level of risk of physical injury that they\npose\u201d).\n    These considerations taken together convince us that,\n\u201c \u2018to give effect . . . to every clause and word\u2019 \u201d of this stat-\nute, we should read the examples as limiting the crimes\nthat clause (ii) covers to crimes that are roughly similar,\nin kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples\nthemselves. Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001)\n(quoting United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538\u2013\n539 (1955); some internal quotation marks omitted); see\nalso Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 12 (2004) (describing\nthe need to interpret a statute in a way that gives mean-\ning to each word).\n    The concurrence complains that our interpretive ap-\nproach is insufficiently specific. See post, at 3\u20134 (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in judgment). But the concurrence\u2019s own\napproach demands a crime-by-crime analysis, uses a\nstandard of measurement (comparative degree of risk)\nthat even the concurrence admits is often \u201cunclear,\u201d post,\nat 4, requires the concurrence to turn here to the still less\nclear \u201crule of lenity,\u201d post, at 6, and, as we explain, is less\nlikely to reflect Congress\u2019 intent. See, e.g., post, at 6\u20137\n(recognizing inability to measure quantitative seriousness\nof risks associated with DUI).\n6                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The statute\u2019s history offers further support for our\nconclusion that the examples in clause (ii) limit the scope\nof the clause to crimes that are similar to the examples\nthemselves. Prior to the enactment of the current lan-\nguage, the Act applied its enhanced sentence to offenders\nwith \u201cthree previous convictions for robbery or burglary.\u201d\nTaylor, 495 U. S., at 581 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Congress sought to expand that definition to include\nboth crimes against the person (clause (i)) and certain\nphysically risky crimes against property (clause (ii)). See\nH. R. Rep. No. 99\u2013849, p. 3 (1986) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.).\nWhen doing so, Congress rejected a broad proposal that\nwould have covered every offense that involved a substan-\ntial risk of the use of \u201c \u2018physical force against the person or\nproperty of another.\u2019 \u201d Taylor, supra, at 583 (quoting S.\n2312, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986); H. R. 4639, 99th Cong.,\n2d Sess. (1986)). Instead, it added the present examples.\nAnd in the relevant House Report, it described clause (ii)\nas including \u201cState and Federal felonies against property\nsuch as burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives and\nsimilar crimes as predicate offenses where the conduct\ninvolved presents a serious risk of injury to a person.\u201d\nH. R. Rep., at 5 (emphasis added).\n   Of course, the statute places the word \u201cotherwise,\u201d just\nafter the examples, so that the provision covers a felony\nthat is one of the example crimes \u201cor otherwise involves\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). But we cannot\nagree with the Government that the word \u201cotherwise\u201d is\nsufficient to demonstrate that the examples do not limit\nthe scope of the clause. That is because the word \u201cother-\nwise\u201d can (we do not say must, cf. post, at 4 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in judgment)) refer to a crime that is similar to\nthe listed examples in some respects but different in oth-\ners\u2014similar say in respect to the degree of risk it pro-\nduces, but different in respect to the \u201cway or manner\u201d in\n                  Cite as: 553 U.

Webster\u2019s Third New Interna-\ntional Dictionary 1598 (1961) (defining \u201cotherwise\u201d to\nmean \u201cin a different way or manner\u201d).\n                                2\n   In our view, DUI differs from the example crimes\u2014\nburglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of\nexplosives\u2014in at least one pertinent, and important,\nrespect. The listed crimes all typically involve purposeful,\n\u201cviolent,\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d conduct. 470 F. 3d, at 980\n(McConnell, J., dissenting in part); see, e.g., Taylor, supra,\nat 598 (\u201cburglary\u201d is an unlawful or unprivileged entry\ninto a building or other structure with \u201cintent to commit a\ncrime\u201d); ALI Model Penal Code \u00a7220.1(1) (1985) (\u201carson\u201d is\ncausing a fire or explosion with \u201cthe purpose of,\u201d e.g.,\n\u201cdestroying a building . . . of another\u201d or \u201cdamaging any\nproperty . . . to collect insurance\u201d); id., \u00a7223.4 (extortion is\n\u201cpurposely\u201d obtaining property of another through threat\nof, e.g., inflicting \u201cbodily injury\u201d); Leocal, supra, at 9 (the\nword \u201c \u2018use\u2019 . . . most naturally suggests a higher degree of\nintent than negligent or merely accidental conduct\u201d which\nfact helps bring it outside the scope of the statutory term\n\u201ccrime of violence\u201d). That conduct is such that it makes\nmore likely that an offender, later possessing a gun, will\nuse that gun deliberately to harm a victim. Crimes com-\nmitted in such a purposeful, violent, and aggressive man-\nner are \u201cpotentially more dangerous when firearms are\ninvolved.\u201d 470 F. 3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in\npart). And such crimes are \u201ccharacteristic of the armed\ncareer criminal, the eponym of the statute.\u201d Ibid.\n   By way of contrast, statutes that forbid driving under\nthe influence, such as the statute before us, typically do\nnot insist on purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct;\nrather, they are, or are most nearly comparable to, crimes\nthat impose strict liability, criminalizing conduct in re-\nspect to which the offender need not have had any crimi-\n8                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnal intent at all. The Government argues that \u201cthe know-\ning nature of the conduct that produces intoxication com-\nbined with the inherent recklessness of the ensuing con-\nduct more than suffices\u201d to create an element of intent.\nBrief for United States 35. And we agree with the Gov-\nernment that a drunk driver may very well drink on pur-\npose. But this Court has said that, unlike the example\ncrimes, the conduct for which the drunk driver is convicted\n(driving under the influence) need not be purposeful or\ndeliberate. See Leocal, 543 U. S., at 11 (a DUI offense\ninvolves \u201caccidental or negligent conduct\u201d); see also 470\nF. 3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part) (\u201c[D]runk\ndriving is a crime of negligence or recklessness, rather\nthan violence or aggression\u201d).\n   When viewed in terms of the Act\u2019s basic purposes, this\ndistinction matters considerably. As suggested by its title,\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act focuses upon the special\ndanger created when a particular type of offender\u2014a\nviolent criminal or drug trafficker\u2014possesses a gun. See\nTaylor, supra, at 587\u2013588; 470 F. 3d, at 981, n. 3 (McCon-\nnell, J., dissenting in part) (\u201c[T]he title [of the Act] was not\nmerely decorative\u201d). In order to determine which offend-\ners fall into this category, the Act looks to past crimes.\nThis is because an offender\u2019s criminal history is relevant\nto the question whether he is a career criminal, or, more\nprecisely, to the kind or degree of danger the offender\nwould pose were he to possess a gun.\n   In this respect\u2014namely, a prior crime\u2019s relevance to the\npossibility of future danger with a gun\u2014crimes involving\nintentional or purposeful conduct (as in burglary and\narson) are different than DUI, a strict liability crime. In\nboth instances, the offender\u2019s prior crimes reveal a degree\nof callousness toward risk, but in the former instance they\nalso show an increased likelihood that the offender is the\nkind of person who might deliberately point the gun and\npull the trigger. We have no reason to believe that Con-\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngress intended a 15-year mandatory prison term where\nthat increased likelihood does not exist.\n   Were we to read the statute without this distinction, its\n15-year mandatory minimum sentence would apply to a\nhost of crimes which, though dangerous, are not typically\ncommitted by those whom one normally labels \u201carmed\ncareer criminals.\u201d     See, e.g., Ark. Code Ann. \u00a78\u20134\u2013\n103(a)(2)(A)(ii) (2007) (reckless polluters); 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a71319(c)(1) (individuals who negligently introduce pollut-\nants into the sewer system); 18 U. S.

We have no reason to believe that Congress\nintended to bring within the statute\u2019s scope these kinds of\ncrimes, far removed as they are from the deliberate kind of\nbehavior associated with violent criminal use of firearms.\nThe statute\u2019s use of examples (and the other considera-\ntions we have mentioned) indicate the contrary.\n   The dissent\u2019s approach, on the other hand, would likely\ninclude these crimes within the statutory definition of\n\u201cviolent felony,\u201d along with any other crime that can be\nsaid to present \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury.\u201d\nPost, at 2 (opinion of ALITO, J.). And it would do so be-\ncause it believes such a result is compelled by the statute\u2019s\ntext. See ibid. But the dissent\u2019s explanation does not\naccount for a key feature of that text\u2014namely, the four\nexample crimes intended to illustrate what kind of \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d the statute covers. The dissent at most believes\nthat these examples are relevant only to define the \u201crequi-\nsite\u201d serious risk associated with a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d\nPost, at 6. But the dissent does not explain what it means\nby \u201crequisite,\u201d nor does it describe how these various\nexamples might help define that term in the context of\nthis statute. If they were in fact helpful on that score, we\nmight expect more predictable results from a purely risk-\nbased approach. Compare post, at 1, 6\u20137 (SCALIA, J.,\n10                BEGAY v.

Thus, the dissent\u2019s reliance on these examples\nfor a function they appear incapable of performing reads\nthem out of the statute and, in so doing, fails to effectuate\nCongress\u2019 purpose to punish only a particular subset of\noffender, namely career criminals.\n   The distinction we make does not minimize the serious-\nness of the risks attached to driving under the influence.\nNor does our argument deny that an individual with a\ncriminal history of DUI might later pull the trigger of a\ngun. (Indeed, we may have such an instance before us.\n470 F. 3d, at 965.) Rather, we hold only that, for purposes\nof the particular statutory provision before us, a prior\nrecord of DUI, a strict liability crime, differs from a prior\nrecord of violent and aggressive crimes committed inten-\ntionally such as arson, burglary, extortion, or crimes in-\nvolving the use of explosives. The latter are associated\nwith a likelihood of future violent, aggressive, and pur-\nposeful \u201carmed career criminal\u201d behavior in a way that the\nformer are not.\n   We consequently conclude that New Mexico\u2019s crime of\n\u201cdriving under the influence\u201d falls outside the scope of the\nArmed Career Criminal Act\u2019s clause (ii) \u201cviolent felony\u201d\ndefinition.

S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\nContrary to the Court, I conclude that the residual clause\nunambiguously encompasses all crimes that present a\nserious risk of injury to another. But because I cannot say\nthat drunk driving clearly poses such a risk (within the\nmeaning of the statute), the rule of lenity brings me to\nconcur in the judgment of the Court.\n                             I\n  Last Term, in James v. United States, 550 U. S. ___\n(2007), the Court held that attempted burglary qualifies\nas a violent felony under \u00a7924(e). It concluded that to\ndetermine whether a predicate crime falls under the re-\nsidual clause, a court should first identify the enumerated\ncrime to which the predicate crime is most closely analo-\ngous and then decide whether the risk posed by the predi-\ncate crime is roughly equivalent to the risk posed by the\nenumerated crime. Because burglary was the enumerated\ncrime most closely analogous to attempted burglary, and\nattempted burglary in the Court\u2019s judgment posed roughly\n2                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe same risk of physical injury as burglary, attempted\nburglary qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7924(e). See\nid., at ____ (slip op., at 15).\n   Unfortunately, the Court\u2019s approach in deciding that\ncase provided no guidance for deciding future cases that\ninvolve predicate crimes other than attempted burglary,\nparticularly those for which there are no clear analogs\namong the enumerated crimes. Pointing out that problem\nin dissent, I anticipated this very case: \u201cIs, for example,\ndriving under the influence of alcohol more analogous to\nburglary, arson, extortion, or a crime involving use of\nexplosives?\u201d Id., at ____ (slip op., at 2).\n   My dissent set out a different approach to the statute.\nIn my view, the best way to interpret \u00a7924(e) is first to\ndetermine which of the enumerated offenses poses the\nleast serious risk of physical injury, and then to set that\nlevel of risk as the \u201cserious potential risk\u201d required by the\nstatute. Crimes that pose at least that serious a risk of\ninjury are encompassed by the residual clause; crimes that\ndo not are excluded. In my judgment, burglary was the\nleast risky crime among the enumerated offenses, and I\ntherefore concluded that attempted burglary, which is less\nrisky than burglary, is not covered by the residual clause.\n   The Court held otherwise in James, and since this is a\nstatutory case that holding has a strong claim to stare\ndecisis. But the concomitant of the sad fact that the the-\nory of James has very limited application is the happy fact\nthat its stare decisis effect is very limited as well. It must\nbe followed, I presume, for unenumerated crimes that are\nanalogous to enumerated crimes (e.g., attempted arson).\nIt provides no answer, and suggests no approach to an\nanswer, where, as here, the predicate crime has no analog\namong the enumerated crimes. For such cases I would\ntherefore adhere to the principles I set forth in my James\ndissent.\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                              II\n   Today the Court devises a different way to give concrete\nmeaning to the residual clause. Confronted with a predi-\ncate crime that has no obvious analog among the enumer-\nated offenses, the Court engrafts a requirement onto the\nresidual clause that a predicate crime involve \u201cpurposeful,\n\u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct.\u201d Ante, at 7. By doing\nso, it excludes a slew of crimes from the scope of the resid-\nual clause, including (not by happenstance) the crime at\nissue here, drunk driving. Like James, this latest made-\nfor-the-case improvisation does not (as my resolution does)\nprovide a complete framework that will embrace all future\ncases. There are still many crimes that are not analogous\nto the enumerated crimes (so that their status cannot be\nresolved by James) but do involve \u201cpurposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019\nand \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct\u201d (so that their status cannot be\nresolved by today\u2019s deus ex machina). Presumably some\nthird (and perhaps fourth and fifth) gimmick will be de-\nvised to resolve those cases as they arise, leaving our\nbrethren on the district courts and courts of appeals much\nroom for enjoyable speculation.\n   But quite apart from its regrettable continuation of a\npiecemeal, suspenseful, Scrabble-like approach to the\ninterpretation of this statute, the problem with the Court\u2019s\nholding today is that it is not remotely faithful to the\nstatute that Congress wrote. There is simply no basis\n(other than the necessity of resolving the present case) for\nholding that the enumerated and unenumerated crimes\nmust be similar in respects other than the degree of risk\nthat they pose.\n   The Court is correct that the clause \u201cotherwise involves\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another\u201d signifies a similarity between the enu-\nmerated and unenumerated crimes. It is not, however,\nany old similarity, such as (to take a random example)\n\u201cpurposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct.\u201d Rather, it\n4                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nis the particular similarity specified after the \u201cother-\nwise\u201d\u2014i.e., that they all pose a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another. They need not be similar in\nany other way. As the Court correctly notes, the word\n\u201cotherwise\u201d in this context means \u201c \u2018in a different way or\nmanner.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6\u20137; see also James, 550 U. S., at ___\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4); Webster\u2019s New\nInternational Dictionary 1729 (2d ed. 1957) (\u201cin another\nway or in other ways\u201d). Therefore, by using the word\n\u201cotherwise\u201d the writer draws a substantive connection\nbetween two sets only on one specific dimension\u2014i.e.,\nwhatever follows \u201cotherwise.\u201d What that means here is\nthat \u201ccommitting one of the enumerated crimes . . . is one\nway to commit a crime \u2018involv[ing] a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another\u2019; and that other ways of com-\nmitting a crime of that character similarly constitute\n\u2018violent felon[ies].\u2019 \u201d James, supra, at ___ (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 5).\n   The Court rejects this seemingly straightforward statu-\ntory analysis, reading the residual clause to mean that the\nunenumerated offenses must be similar to the enumerated\noffenses not only in the degree of risk they pose, but also\n\u201cin kind,\u201d despite the fact that \u201cotherwise\u201d means that the\ncommon element of risk must be presented \u201c \u2018in a different\nway or manner.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 5\u20137 (emphasis added). The\nCourt\u2019s explanation for this interpretation seems to be\nthat the enumerated crimes are \u201cso far from clear in re-\nspect to the degree of risk each poses that it is difficult to\naccept clarification in respect to degree of risk as Con-\ngress\u2019s only reason for including them.\u201d Ante, at 5. While\nI certainly agree that the degree of risk associated with\nthe enumerated crimes is unclear, I find it unthinkable\nthat the solution to that problem is to write a different\nstatute. The phrase \u201cotherwise involves conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother\u201d limits inclusion in the statute only by a crime\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndegree of risk. See James, supra, at ___ (SCALIA, J., dis-\nsenting) (slip op., at 5). The use of the adjective \u201cserious\u201d\nseems to me to signify a purely quantitative measure of\nrisk. If both an intentional and a negligent crime pose a\n50% risk of death, could one be characterized as involving\na \u201cserious risk\u201d and the other not? Surely not.\n   The Court supports its argument with that ever-ready\nrefuge from the hardships of statutory text, the (judicially)\nperceived statutory purpose. According to the Court,\nbecause the Armed Career Criminal Act is concerned with\n\u201cthe special danger created when a particular type of\noffender\u2014a violent criminal or drug trafficker\u2014possesses\na gun,\u201d the statutory purpose favors applying \u00a7924(e)\u2019s\nenhanced penalty only to those criminals \u201cwho might\ndeliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\u201d Ante, at\n8\u20139. I cannot possibly infer that purpose from the statute.\nFor all I know, the statute was meant to punish those who\nare indifferent to human life, or who are undeterred by the\ncriminal penalties attached to the commission of other\ncrimes (after all, the statute enhances penalties for drug\ntraffickers, see \u00a7924(e)(2)(A)). While the Court\u2019s asserted\npurpose would surely be a reasonable one, it has no more\ngrounding in the statutory text than do these other possi-\nbilities. And what is more, the Court\u2019s posited purpose is\npositively contradicted by the fact that one of the enumer-\nated crimes\u2014the unlawful use of explosives\u2014may involve\nmerely negligent or reckless conduct. See ALI, Model\nPenal Code \u00a7220.2(2) (1985) (\u201cA person is guilty of a mis-\ndemeanor if he recklessly creates a risk of catastrophe in\nthe employment of fire, explosives or other dangerous\nmeans\u201d); id., \u00a7220.3 (\u201cA person is guilty of criminal mis-\nchief if he . . . damages tangible property of another pur-\nposely, recklessly, or by negligence in the employment of\nfire, explosives, or other dangerous means\u201d).\n   The Court says that an interpretation of the residual\nclause that includes all crimes posing a serious risk of\n6                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninjury would render superfluous \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), which\nprovides that a \u201cviolent felony\u201d is any crime that \u201chas as\nan element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\nphysical force against the person\u201d of another. Ante, at 4\n(internal quotation marks omitted). But the canon against\nsurplusage has substantially less force when it comes to\ninterpreting a broad residual clause like the one at issue\nhere. Though the second clause renders the first superflu-\nous, it would raise no eyebrows to refer to \u201ccrimes that\nentail the use of force and crimes that, while not entailing\nthe use of force, nonetheless present a serious risk of\ninjury to another person.\u201d In any event, the canon against\nsurplusage merely helps decide between competing per-\nmissible interpretations of an ambiguous statute; it does\nnot sanction writing in a requirement that Congress ne-\nglected to think of. And finally, come to think of it, the\nCourt\u2019s solution does nothing whatever to solve the sup-\nposed surplusage problem. Crimes that include as an\nelement \u201cthe use . . . of physical force against the person of\nanother\u201d are all embraced (and the reference to them thus\nrendered superfluous) by the requirement of \u201cpurposeful,\n\u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct\u201d that the Court invents.\n                              III\n   Under my interpretation of \u00a7924(e), I must answer one\nquestion: Does drunk driving pose at least as serious a\nrisk of physical injury to another as burglary? From the\nevidence presented by the Government, I cannot conclude\nso. Because of that, the rule of lenity requires that I re-\nsolve this case in favor of the defendant.\n   The Government cites the fact that in 2006, 17,062\npersons died from alcohol-related car crashes, and that\n15,121 of those deaths involved drivers with blood-alcohol\nconcentrations of 0.08 or higher. See Brief for United\nStates 17. Drunk driving is surely a national problem of\ngreat concern. But the fact that it kills many people each\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)             7\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nyear tells us very little about whether a single act of drunk\ndriving \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential\nrisk of physical injury to another.\u201d It may well be that an\neven greater number of deaths occurs annually to pedes-\ntrians crossing the street; but that hardly means that\ncrossing the street presents a serious potential risk of\ninjury. Where the issue is \u201crisk,\u201d the annual number of\ninjuries from an activity must be compared with the an-\nnual incidents of the activity. Otherwise drunk driving\ncould be said to pose a more serious risk of physical harm\nthan murder. In addition, drunk driving is a combination\nof two activities: (1) drinking and (2) driving. If driving\nalone results in injury in a certain percentage of cases, it\ncould hardly be said that the entirety of the risk posed by\ndrunk driving can be attributed to the combination. And\nfinally, injuries to the drunk drivers themselves must be\nexcluded from the calculus, because the statute counts\nonly injuries to other persons.\n   Needless to say, we do not have these relevant statistics.\nAnd even if we did, we would still need to know similar\nstatistics for burglary, which are probably even harder to\ncome by. This does not mean that I will never be able to\nidentify a crime that falls under the residual clause. For\nsome crimes, the severity of the risk will be obvious.\nCrimes like negligent homicide, see ALI, Model Penal\nCode \u00a7210.4 (1980), conspiracy to commit a violent crime,\nid., \u00a75.03 (1985), inciting to riot, 18 U. S. C. \u00a72101, and the\nproduction of chemical weapons, \u00a7229, certainly pose a\nmore serious risk of physical injury to others than bur-\nglary. (By contrast, the Court\u2019s approach eliminates from\nthe residual clause all negligent crimes, even those that\nentail a 100% risk of physical injury such as negligent\nhomicide.) But I can do no more than guess as to whether\ndrunk driving poses a more serious risk than burglary,\nand I will not condemn a man to a minimum of 15 years in\nprison on the basis of such speculation.

He had 12 prior convictions in New Mexico for\ndriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).

While murders commit-\nted in the course of extortion were not separately reported, common\nsense and the fact that the total number of murders was similar to the\nnumber of fatal alcohol-related crashes at least after 1997 indicates\nthat murders involving extortion would not rival deaths in alcohol-\nrelated auto accidents.

As noted, petitioner had a\ndozen prior DUI convictions. Persons who repeatedly\ndrive drunk present a greatly enhanced danger that they\nand others will be injured as a result.5 In addition, it has\nbeen estimated that the ratio of DUI incidents to DUI\narrests is between 250 to 1 and 2,000 to 1.6 Accordingly,\nthe risk presented by a 10th, 11th, and 12th DUI convic-\ntion may be viewed as the risk created by literally thou-\nsands of drunk-driving events. That risk was surely \u201cseri-\nous,\u201d and therefore petitioner\u2019s offenses fell squarely\nwithin the language of the statute.\n   Moreover, taking the statutory language to mean what\nit says would not sweep in all DUI convictions. Most DUI\nconvictions are not punishable by a term of imprisonment\nof more than one year and thus fall outside the scope of\nthe statute.7 Petitioner\u2019s convictions qualified only be-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nrelatively small number of 475 deaths and over 2,000 injuries annually.\nDept. of Homeland Security, U.

S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B), i.e., bur-\nglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving the use of\nexplosives. These crimes, according to the Court, \u201call\ntypically involve purposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019\nconduct.\u201d Ante, at 7 (quoting 470 F. 3d, at 980 (McCon-\nnell, J., dissenting)).\n   This interpretation cannot be squared with the text of\nthe statute, which simply does not provide that an offense\nmust be \u201cpurposeful,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d or \u201caggressive\u201d in order to\nfall within the residual clause. Rather, after listing bur-\nglary, arson, extortion, and explosives offenses, the statute\nprovides (in the residual clause) that an offense qualifies if\nit \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious\npotential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Therefore,\noffenses falling within the residual clause must be similar\nto the named offenses in one respect only: They must,\n\u201cotherwise\u201d\u2014which is to say, \u201cin a different manner,\u201d 10\nOED 984 (def. B(1)); see also Webster\u2019s 1598\u2014\u201cinvolve[]\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another.\u201d Requiring that an offense must also be\n\u201cpurposeful,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d or \u201caggressive\u201d amounts to adding\nnew elements to the statute, but we \u201cordinarily resist\nreading words or elements into a statute that do not ap-\npear on its face.\u201d Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 29\n(1997).\n   Each part of this additional, judicially added require-\nment presents other problems as well.\n   Purposeful. At least one State\u2019s DUI law requires proof\nof purposeful conduct. See Tam v. State, 232 Ga. App. 15,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nDUI offense as a misdemeanor).\n6                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n___, 501 S. E. 2d 51, 52 (1998) (requiring proof of the\nintent to drive). In addition, many States recognize invol-\nuntary intoxication as a defense. See 4 R. Essen & R.\nErwin, Defense of Drunk Driving Cases: Criminal\u2014Civil\n\u00a744.04 (2007). And even in States that do not require\npurposefulness, I have no doubt that the overwhelming\nmajority of DUI defendants purposefully drank before\ngetting behind the wheel and were purposefully operating\ntheir vehicles at the time of apprehension. I suspect that\nmany DUI statutes do not require proof of purposefulness\nbecause the element is almost always present, requiring\nproof of the element would introduce an unnecessary\ncomplication, and it would make no sense to preclude\nconviction of those defendants who were so drunk that\nthey did not even realize that they were behind the wheel.\n   Violent. It is clear that 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B) is not\nlimited to \u201cviolent\u201d crimes, for if it were, it would be re-\ndundant. The prior subparagraph, \u00a7924(e)(2)(A), includes\noffenses that have as an element the use or threatened use\nof violence.\n   Aggressive. The concept of \u201caggressive\u201d crimes is vague,\nand in any event, it is hardly apparent why DUI\u2014not to\nmention the species of felony DUI recidivism that resulted\nin petitioner\u2019s predicament\u2014is not \u201caggressive.\u201d Driving\ncan certainly involve \u201caggressive\u201d conduct. Indeed, some\nStates have created the offense of \u201caggressive driving.\u201d\nSee M. Savage, M. Sundeen, & A. Teigen, Traffic Safety\nand Public Health: State Legislative Action 2007, Trans-\nportation Series (National Conference of State Leg-\nislatures, Dec. 2007, No. 32), p. 17, and App. J, online\nat http://www.ncsl.org/print/transportation/07trafficsafety.\npdf. Most States have a toll-free telephone number to call\nto report \u201caggressive\u201d driving.

S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n    The Court defends its new statutory element on the\nground that a defendant who merely engages in felony\ndrunk driving is not likely to be \u201cthe kind of person who\nmight deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\u201d\nAnte, at 8\u20139. The Court cites no empirical support for this\nconclusion, and its accuracy is not self-evident. Peti-\ntioner\u2019s pattern of behavior may or may not be typical of\nthose defendants who have enough DUI convictions to\nqualify under N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a766\u20138\u2013102(G) and 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B), but the example of his behavior in\nthis case\u2014pointing a gun at his aunt\u2019s head and repeat-\nedly pulling the trigger\u2014should surely be enough to coun-\nsel against uncritical reliance on stereotypes about \u201cthe\ntype\u201d of people who commit felony DUI violations.\n    Defendants who qualify for an enhanced sentence under\n\u00a7924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) based (in whole or in part)\non felony DUI convictions share at least three characteris-\ntics that are relevant for present purposes. First, they are\npersons who, in the judgment of Congress, cannot be\ntrusted to use a firearm responsibly. In order to qualify\nfor an enhanced sentence under \u00a7924(e), a defendant must\nof course be convicted of violating the felon-in-possession\nstatute, \u00a7922(g) (2000 ed.). The felon-in-possession statute\nnecessarily rests on the judgment that a person with a\nprior felony conviction cannot be trusted with a firearm.\nSee Caron v. United States, 524 U. S. 308, 315 (1998)\n(\u201cCongress meant to keep guns away from all offenders\nwho, the Federal Government feared, might cause harm\n. . .\u201d). And there is no dispute that a prior felony DUI\nconviction qualifies as a felony under the felon-in-\npossession law. If Congress thought that a person with a\nprior felony DUI conviction is not \u201cthe kind of person\u201d who\nis likely to use a gun unlawfully, why would Congress\nhave made it a crime for such a person to possess a gun?\n    Second, defendants with DUI convictions that are\ncounted under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B) are likely to have\n8                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nserious alcohol abuse problems. As previously mentioned,\nordinary DUI convictions are generally not counted under\n\u00a7924(e) because they are not punishable by imprisonment\nfor more than a year. Such penalties are generally re-\nserved for persons, like petitioner, with a record of re-\npeated DUI violations. See National Conference of State\nLegislatures, supra. Such individuals are very likely to\nhave serious alcohol abuse problems and a propensity to\nengage in irresponsible conduct while under the influence.\nAlcohol use often precedes violent crimes, see, e.g., Roizen,\nEpidemiological Issues in Alcohol-Related Violence, in 13\nRecent Developments in Alcoholism 7, 8\u20139 (M. Galanter\ned. 1997), and thus there is reason to worry about the\nmisuse of firearms by defendants whose alcohol abuse\nproblems are serious enough to result in felony DUI\nconvictions.\n   Third, defendants with DUI convictions that are\ncounted under \u00a7924(e)(2)(B) have either (a) such serious\nalcohol abuse problems that they have at least three prior\nfelony DUI convictions or (b) both one or two felony DUI\nconvictions and one or two offenses that fall under\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) (offenses that have \u201cas an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d) or that\nare specifically set out in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (burglary, arson,\nextortion, or an explosives offense). Defendants with three\nfelony DUI convictions are likely to be super\u2013DUI-\nrecidivists like petitioner. Defendants with a combination\nof felony DUI and other qualifying convictions\u2014for exam-\nple, convictions for assault or burglary\u2014are persons who,\neven by the Court\u2019s lights, could be classified as \u201cthe kind\nof person who might deliberately point [a] gun and pull\nthe trigger.\u201d\n   Unlike the Court, I cannot say that persons with these\ncharacteristics are less likely to use a gun illegally than\nare persons convicted of other qualifying felonies.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concurrence takes a different ap-\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nproach, but his analysis is likewise flawed. JUSTICE\nSCALIA would hold (a) that an offense does not fall within\nthe residual clause unless it presents a risk that is at least\nas great as that presented by the least dangerous of the\nenumerated offenses; (b) that burglary is the least danger-\nous of the enumerated offenses; (c) that the relevant\nmeasure of risk is the risk that the typical burglary, DUI,\netc. would result in injury; and (d) that the risk presented\nby an incident of DUI is less than the risk presented by a\nburglary.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, like the Court, does not follow the\nstatutory language. The statute says that offenses falling\nwithin the residual clause must present \u201ca serious poten-\ntial risk of physical injury to another.\u201d The statute does\nnot say that these offenses must present at least as much\nrisk as the enumerated offenses.\n   The statute also does not say, as JUSTICE SCALIA would\nhold, that the relevant risk is the risk that each incident of\nDUI will result in injury. I see no basis for concluding\nthat Congress was not also concerned with the risk faced\nby potential victims, particularly since the statute explic-\nitly refers to \u201cpotential risk.\u201d Drunk driving is regarded as\na severe societal problem in large measure because of the\nvery large number of victims it produces each year.\n   Finally, JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s conclusion that burglary is the\nleast risky of the enumerated offenses is based on a pro-\ncrustean reading of \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This provision refers,\nwithout qualification, to \u201cextortion.\u201d In his dissent in\nJames v. United States, 550 U. S. ___ (2007), JUSTICE\nSCALIA concluded that many forms of extortion are \u201cinher-\nently unlikely to cause physical harm.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10) (emphasis in original). Only by finding that the\nterm \u201cextortion\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) really means only\ncertain forms of extortion was JUSTICE SCALIA able to\ncome to the conclusion that burglary is the least risky of\nthe enumerated offenses.\n10               BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  For all these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the\nTenth Circuit.\n",

The question in this case is whether driving under the influence of alcohol is a \"violent felony\" as the Act defines it. We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Federal law prohibits a previously convicted felon from possessing a firearm. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000 ed.). A related provision provides for a prison term of up to 10 years for an ordinary offender. \u00a7 924(a)(2). The Armed Career Criminal Act imposes a more stringent 15-year mandatory minimum sentence on an offender who has three prior convictions \"for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\" \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>The Act defines a \"violent felony\" as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" that</p>\n<blockquote>\"(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.).</blockquote>\n<p>We here consider whether driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), as set forth in New Mexico's criminal statutes, falls within the scope of the second clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The relevant background circumstances include the following: In September 2004, New Mexico police officers received a report that Larry Begay, the petitioner here, had threatened his sister and aunt with a rifle. The police arrested him. Begay subsequently conceded he was a felon and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1584</span> pleaded guilty to a federal charge of unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1). Begay's presentence report said that he had been convicted a dozen times for DUI, which under New Mexico's law, becomes a felony (punishable by a prison term of more than one year) the fourth (or subsequent) time an individual commits it. See N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 66-8-102(G) to (J) (Supp.2007). The sentencing judge consequently found that Begay had at least three prior convictions for a crime \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" 377 F.Supp.2d 1141, 1143 (NM 2005). The judge also concluded that Begay's \"three felony DUI convictions involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1145. The judge consequently concluded that Begay had three or more prior convictions for a \"violent felony\" and should receive a sentence that reflected a mandatory minimum prison term of 15 years. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Begay, claiming that DUI is not a \"violent felony\" within the terms of the statute, appealed. The Court of Appeals panel by a vote of 2 to 1 rejected that claim. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796199\"><a href=\"/opinion/796199/united-states-v-larry-begay/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">964</span></a></span> (C.A.10 2006). Begay sought certiorari, and we agreed to decide the question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>New Mexico's DUI statute makes it a crime (and a felony after three earlier convictions) to \"drive a vehicle within [the] state\" if the driver \"is under the influence of intoxicating liquor\" (or has an alcohol concentration of .08 or more in his blood or breath within three hours of having driven the vehicle resulting from \"alcohol consumed before or while driving the vehicle\"). \u00a7\u00a7 66-8-102(A), (C). In determining whether this crime is a violent felony, we consider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine it in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion. See <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (adopting this \"categorical approach\"); see also <i>James v. United States,</i> 550 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1597, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (attempted burglary is a violent felony even if, on <i>some</i> occasions, it can be committed in a way that poses no serious risk of physical harm).</p>\n<p>We also take as a given that DUI does not fall within the scope of the Act's <i>clause (i)</i> \"violent felony\" definition. DUI, as New Mexico defines it, nowhere \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>Finally, we assume that the lower courts were right in concluding that DUI involves conduct that \"presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Drunk driving is an extremely dangerous crime. In the United States in 2006, alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes claimed the lives of more than 17,000 individuals and harmed untold amounts of property. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., Traffic Safety Facts, 2006 Traffic Safety Annual Assessment\u0097Alcohol-Related Fatalities 1 (No. 810821, Aug. 2007), http://www-nrd.nhtsa. dot.gov/Pubs/810821.PDF (as visited Apr. 11, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Even so, we find that DUI falls outside the scope of clause (ii). It is simply too unlike the provision's listed examples for us to believe that Congress intended the provision to cover it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>In our view, the provision's listed examples\u0097burglary, arson, extortion, or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1585</span> crimes involving the use of explosives\u0097 illustrate the kinds of crimes that fall within the statute's scope. Their presence indicates that the statute covers only <i>similar</i> crimes, rather than <i>every</i> crime that \"presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). If Congress meant the latter, <i>i.e.,</i> if it meant the statute to be all-encompassing, it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all. Without them, clause (ii) would cover <i>all</i> crimes that present a \"serious potential risk of physical injury.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Additionally, if Congress meant clause (ii) to include <i>all</i> risky crimes, why would it have included clause (i)? A crime which has as an element the \"use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\" against the person (as clause (i) specifies) is likely to create \"a serious potential risk of physical injury\" and would seem to fall within the scope of clause (ii).</p>\n<p>Of course, Congress <i>might</i> have included the examples solely for quantitative purposes. Congress might have intended them to demonstrate no more than the degree of risk sufficient to bring a crime within the statute's scope. But were that the case, Congress would have likely chosen examples that better illustrated the \"degree of risk\" it had in mind. Our recent case, <i>James v. United States</i>\u0097where we considered only matters of degree, <i>i.e.,</i> whether the amount of risk posed by attempted burglary was comparable to the amount of risk posed by the example crime of burglary\u0097illustrates the difficulty of interpreting the examples in this respect. Compare 550 U.S., at ___ _ ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1594-1597, with <i>id.,</i> at ___, ___ _ ___, ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1601, 1603-1604, 1609 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Indeed, the examples are so far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses that it is difficult to accept clarification in respect to degree of risk as Congress' only reason for including them. See <i>id.,</i> at 1598-99 (\"Congress provided examples [that] ... have little in common, most especially with respect to the level of risk of physical injury that they pose\").</p>\n<p>These considerations taken together convince us that, \"`to give effect ... to every clause and word'\" of this statute, we should read the examples as limiting the crimes that clause (ii) covers to crimes that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves. <i>Duncan v.

See <i>post,</i> at 1589-1590 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). But the concurrence's own approach demands a crime-by-crime analysis, uses a standard of measurement (comparative degree of risk) that even the concurrence admits is often \"unclear,\" <i>post,</i> at 1590, requires the concurrence to turn here to the still less clear \"rule of lenity,\" <i>post,</i> at 1591, and, as we explain, is less likely to reflect Congress' intent. See, <i>e.g., post,</i> at 1590-1591 (recognizing inability to measure quantitative seriousness of risks associated with DUI).</p>\n<p>The statute's history offers further support for our conclusion that the examples in clause (ii) limit the scope of the clause to crimes that are similar to the examples themselves. Prior to the enactment of the current language, the Act applied its enhanced sentence to offenders with \"three <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1586</span> previous convictions for robbery or burglary.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 581, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (internal quotation marks omitted). Congress sought to expand that definition to include both crimes against the person (clause (i)) and certain physically risky crimes against property (clause (ii)). See H.R.Rep. No. 99-849, p. 3 (1986) (hereinafter H.R.Rep.). When doing so, Congress rejected a broad proposal that would have covered <i>every</i> offense that involved a substantial risk of the use of \"`physical force against the person or property of another.'\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 583, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (quoting S. 2312, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986); H.R. 4639, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986)). Instead, it added the present examples. And in the relevant House Report, it described clause (ii) as including \"State and Federal felonies against property such as burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives and <i>similar</i> crimes as predicate offenses where the conduct involved presents a serious risk of injury to a person.\" H.R. Rep., at 5 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Of course, the statute places the word \"otherwise,\" just after the examples, so that the provision covers a felony that is one of the example crimes \"or <i>otherwise</i> involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). But we cannot agree with the Government that the word \"otherwise\" is <i>sufficient</i> to demonstrate that the examples do not limit the scope of the clause. That is because the word \"otherwise\" <i>can</i> (we do not say <i>must,</i> cf. <i>post,</i> at 1589-1590 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)) refer to a crime that is similar to the listed examples in some respects but different in others\u0097similar say in respect to the degree of risk it produces, but different in respect to the \"way or manner\" in which it produces that risk. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1598 (1961) (defining \"otherwise\" to mean \"in a different way or manner\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>In our view, DUI differs from the example crimes\u0097burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives\u0097in at least one pertinent, and important, respect. The listed crimes all typically involve purposeful, \"violent,\" and \"aggressive\" conduct. 470 F.3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part); see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (\"burglary\" is an unlawful or unprivileged entry into a building or other structure with \"intent to commit a crime\"); ALI Model Penal Code \u00a7 220.1(1) (1985) (\"arson\" is causing a fire or explosion with the purpose of,\" <i>e.g.,</i> \"destroying a building... of another\" or \"damaging any property ... to collect insurance\"); <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 223.4 (extortion is \"purposely\" obtaining property of another through threat of, <i>e.g.,</i> inflicting \"bodily injury\"); <i>Leocal, supra,</i> at 9, 125 S.Ct. 377 (the word \"`use' ... most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct\" which fact helps bring it outside the scope of the statutory term \"crime of violence\"). That conduct is such that it makes more likely that an offender, later possessing a gun, will use that gun deliberately to harm a victim. Crimes committed in such a purposeful, violent, and aggressive manner are \"potentially more dangerous when firearms are involved.\" 470 F.3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part). And such crimes are \"characteristic of the armed career criminal, the eponym of the statute.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>By way of contrast, statutes that forbid driving under the influence, such as the statute before us, typically do not insist on purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct; rather, they are, or are most nearly comparable to, crimes that impose strict liability, criminalizing conduct in respect to which the offender need not have had any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1587</span> criminal intent at all. The Government argues that \"the knowing nature of the conduct that produces intoxication combined with the inherent recklessness of the ensuing conduct more than suffices\" to create an element of intent. Brief for United States 35. And we agree with the Government that a drunk driver may very well drink on purpose. But this Court has said that, unlike the example crimes, the conduct for which the drunk driver is convicted (driving under the influence) need not be purposeful or deliberate. See <i>Leocal,</i> 543 U.S., at 11, 125 S.Ct. 377 (a DUI offense involves \"accidental or negligent conduct\"); see also 470 F.3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part) (\"[D]runk driving is a crime of negligence or recklessness, rather than violence or aggression\").</p>\n<p>When viewed in terms of the Act's basic purposes, this distinction matters considerably. As suggested by its title, the Armed Career Criminal Act focuses upon the special danger created when a particular type of offender\u0097a violent criminal or drug trafficker\u0097possesses a gun. See <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 587-588, 110 S.Ct. 2143; 470 F.3d, at 981, n. 3 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part) (\"[T]he title [of the Act] was not merely decorative\"). In order to determine which offenders fall into this category, the Act looks to past crimes. This is because an offender's criminal history is relevant to the question whether he is a career criminal, or, more precisely, to the kind or degree of danger the offender would pose were he to possess a gun.</p>\n<p>In this respect\u0097namely, a prior crime's relevance to the possibility of future danger with a gun\u0097crimes involving intentional or purposeful conduct (as in burglary and arson) are different than DUI, a strict liability crime. In both instances, the offender's prior crimes reveal a degree of callousness toward risk, but in the former instance they also show an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger. We have no reason to believe that Congress intended a 15-year mandatory prison term where that increased likelihood does not exist.</p>\n<p>Were we to read the statute without this distinction, its 15-year mandatory minimum sentence would apply to a host of crimes which, though dangerous, are not typically committed by those whom one normally labels \"armed career criminals.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> Ark.Code Ann. \u00a7 8-4-103(a)(2)(A)(ii) (2007) (reckless polluters); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(c)(1) (individuals who negligently introduce pollutants into the sewer system); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(a) (individuals who recklessly tamper with consumer products); \u00a7 1115 (seamen whose inattention to duty causes serious accidents). We have no reason to believe that Congress intended to bring within the statute's scope these kinds of crimes, far removed as they are from the deliberate kind of behavior associated with violent criminal use of firearms. The statute's use of examples (and the other considerations we have mentioned) indicate the contrary.</p>\n<p>The dissent's approach, on the other hand, would likely include these crimes within the statutory definition of \"violent felony,\" along with any other crime that can be said to present \"a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1592 (opinion of ALITO, J.). And it would do so because it believes such a result is compelled by the statute's text. See <i>ibid.</i> But the dissent's explanation does not account for a key feature of that text\u0097 namely, the four example crimes intended to illustrate what kind of \"violent felony\" the statute covers. The dissent at most believes that these examples are relevant only to define the \"requisite\" serious risk associated with a \"crime of violence.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1588</span> <i>Post,</i> at 1595. But the dissent does not explain what it means by \"requisite,\" nor does it describe how these various examples might help define that term in the context of this statute. If they were in fact helpful on that score, we might expect more predictable results from a purely risk-based approach. Compare <i>post,</i> at 1588, 1591-1592 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment), with <i>post,</i> at 1592-1594 (dissenting opinion). Thus, the dissent's reliance on these examples for a function they appear incapable of performing reads them out of the statute and, in so doing, fails to effectuate Congress' purpose to punish only a particular subset of offender, namely career criminals.</p>\n<p>The distinction we make does not minimize the seriousness of the risks attached to driving under the influence. Nor does our argument deny that an individual with a criminal history of DUI might later pull the trigger of a gun. (Indeed, we may have such an instance before us. 470 F.3d, at 965.) Rather, we hold only that, for purposes of the particular statutory provision before us, a prior record of DUI, a strict liability crime, differs from a prior record of violent and aggressive crimes committed intentionally such as arson, burglary, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives. The latter are associated with a likelihood of future violent, aggressive, and purposeful \"armed career criminal\" behavior in a way that the former are not.</p>\n<p>We consequently conclude that New Mexico's crime of \"driving under the influence\" falls outside the scope of the Armed Career Criminal Act's clause (ii) \"violent felony\" definition. And we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in relevant part and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>The statute in this case defines \"violent felony\" in part as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Contrary to the Court, I conclude that the residual clause unambiguously encompasses <i>all</i> crimes that present a serious risk of injury to another. But because I cannot say that drunk driving clearly poses such a risk (within the meaning of the statute), the rule of lenity brings me to concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Last Term, in <i>James v. United States,</i> 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (2007), the Court held that attempted burglary qualifies as a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e). It concluded that to determine whether a predicate crime falls under the residual clause, a court should first identify the enumerated crime to which the predicate crime is most closely analogous and then decide whether the risk posed by the predicate crime is roughly equivalent to the risk posed by the enumerated crime. Because burglary was the enumerated crime most closely analogous to attempted burglary, and attempted burglary in the Court's judgment posed roughly the same risk of physical injury as burglary, attempted burglary qualified as a \"violent felony\" under \u00a7 924(e). See <i>id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1597.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Court's approach in deciding that case provided no guidance for deciding future cases that involve predicate crimes other than attempted burglary, particularly those for which there are no clear analogs among the enumerated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1589</span> crimes. Pointing out that problem in dissent, I anticipated this very case: \"Is, for example, driving under the influence of alcohol more analogous to burglary, arson, extortion, or a crime involving use of explosives?\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1601.</p>\n<p>My dissent set out a different approach to the statute. In my view, the best way to interpret \u00a7 924(e) is first to determine which of the enumerated offenses poses the least serious risk of physical injury, and then to set that level of risk as the \"serious potential risk\" required by the statute. Crimes that pose at least that serious a risk of injury are encompassed by the residual clause; crimes that do not are excluded. In my judgment, burglary was the least risky crime among the enumerated offenses, and I therefore concluded that attempted burglary, which is less risky than burglary, is not covered by the residual clause.</p>\n<p>The Court held otherwise in <i>James,</i> and since this is a statutory case that holding has a strong claim to <i>stare decisis.</i> But the concomitant of the sad fact that the theory of <i>James</i> has very limited application is the happy fact that its <i>stare decisis</i> effect is very limited as well. It must be followed, I presume, for unenumerated crimes that are analogous to enumerated crimes (<i>e.g.,</i> attempted arson). It provides no answer, and suggests no approach to an answer, where, as here, the predicate crime has no analog among the enumerated crimes. For such cases I would therefore adhere to the principles I set forth in my <i>James</i> dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Today the Court devises a different way to give concrete meaning to the residual clause. Confronted with a predicate crime that has no obvious analog among the enumerated offenses, the Court engrafts a requirement onto the residual clause that a predicate crime involve \"purposeful, `violent,' and `aggressive' conduct.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1586. By doing so, it excludes a slew of crimes from the scope of the residual clause, including (not by happenstance) the crime at issue here, drunk driving. Like <i>James,</i> this latest made-for-the-case improvisation does not (as my resolution does) provide a complete framework that will embrace all future cases. There are still many crimes that are not analogous to the enumerated crimes (so that their status cannot be resolved by <i>James</i>) but do involve \"purposeful, `violent,' and `aggressive' conduct\" (so that their status cannot be resolved by today's <i>deus ex machina</i>). Presumably some third (and perhaps fourth and fifth) gimmick will be devised to resolve those cases as they arise, leaving our brethren on the district courts and courts of appeals much room for enjoyable speculation.</p>\n<p>But quite apart from its regrettable continuation of a piecemeal, suspenseful, Scrabble-like approach to the interpretation of this statute, the problem with the Court's holding today is that it is not remotely faithful to the statute that Congress wrote. There is simply no basis (other than the necessity of resolving the present case) for holding that the enumerated and unenumerated crimes must be similar in respects <i>other than the degree of risk that they pose.</i></p>\n<p>The Court is correct that the clause \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" signifies a similarity between the enumerated and unenumerated crimes. It is not, however, <i>any</i> old similarity, such as (to take a random example) \"purposeful, `violent,' and `aggressive' conduct.\" Rather, it is the <i>particular</i> similarity specified after the \"otherwise\"\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> that they all pose a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. They need not be similar <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1590</span> in any other way. As the Court correctly notes, the word \"otherwise\" in this context means \"`in a different way or manner.' \" <i>Ante,</i> at 1587; see also <i>James,</i> 550 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1602 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); Webster's New International Dictionary 1729 (2d ed.1957) (\"in another way or in other ways\"). Therefore, by using the word \"otherwise\" the writer draws a substantive connection between two sets only on one specific dimension\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> whatever follows \"otherwise.\" What that means here is that \"committing one of the enumerated crimes ... is <i>one way</i> to commit a crime `involv[ing] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another'; and that <i>other ways</i> of committing a crime of that character similarly constitute `violent felon[ies].'\" <i>James, supra,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1603 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The Court rejects this seemingly straightforward statutory analysis, reading the residual clause to mean that the unenumerated offenses must be similar to the enumerated offenses not only in the degree of risk they pose, but also \"in kind,\" despite the fact that \"otherwise\" means that the <i>common</i> element of risk must be presented \"`in a <i>different</i> way or manner.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1585-1586 (emphasis added). The Court's explanation for this interpretation seems to be that the enumerated crimes are \"so far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses that it is difficult to accept clarification in respect to degree of risk as Congress's only reason for including them.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1585. While I certainly agree that the degree of risk associated with the enumerated crimes is unclear, I find it unthinkable that the solution to that problem is to write a different statute. The phrase \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" limits inclusion in the statute only by a crime's degree of risk. See <i>James, supra,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1603 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The use of the adjective \"serious\" seems to me to signify a purely quantitative measure of risk. If both an intentional and a negligent crime pose a 50% risk of death, could one be characterized as involving a \"serious risk\" and the other not? Surely not.</p>\n<p>The Court supports its argument with that ever-ready refuge from the hardships of statutory text, the (judicially) perceived statutory purpose. According to the Court, because the Armed Career Criminal Act is concerned with \"the special danger created when a particular type of offender\u0097a violent criminal or drug trafficker\u0097possesses a gun,\" the statutory purpose favors applying \u00a7 924(e)'s enhanced penalty only to those criminals \"who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1587. I cannot possibly infer that purpose from the statute. For all I know, the statute was meant to punish those who are indifferent to human life, or who are undeterred by the criminal penalties attached to the commission of other crimes (after all, the statute enhances penalties for drug traffickers, see \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)). While the Court's asserted purpose would surely be a reasonable one, it has no more grounding in the statutory text than do these other possibilities. And what is more, the Court's posited purpose is positively contradicted by the fact that one of the enumerated crimes\u0097the unlawful use of explosives\u0097may involve merely negligent or reckless conduct. See ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 220.2(2) (1985) (\"A person is guilty of a misdemeanor if he recklessly creates a risk of catastrophe in the employment of fire, explosives or other dangerous means\"); <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 220.3 (\"A person is guilty of criminal mischief if he ... damages tangible property of another purposely, recklessly, or by negligence in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1591</span> employment of fire, explosives, or other dangerous means\").</p>\n<p>The Court says that an interpretation of the residual clause that includes all crimes posing a serious risk of injury would render superfluous \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), which provides that a \"violent felony\" is any crime that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person\" of another. <i>Ante,</i> at 1584 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the canon against surplusage has substantially less force when it comes to interpreting a broad residual clause like the one at issue here. Though the second clause renders the first superfluous, it would raise no eyebrows to refer to \"crimes that entail the use of force and crimes that, while not entailing the use of force, nonetheless present a serious risk of injury to another person.\" In any event, the canon against surplusage merely helps decide between competing permissible interpretations of an ambiguous statute; it does not sanction writing in a requirement that Congress neglected to think of. And finally, come to think of it, the Court's solution does nothing whatever to solve the supposed surplusage problem. Crimes that include as an element \"the use ... of physical force against the person of another\" are all embraced (and the reference to them thus rendered superfluous) by the requirement of \"purposeful, `violent,' and `aggressive' conduct\" that the Court invents.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Under my interpretation of \u00a7 924(e), I must answer one question: Does drunk driving pose at least as serious a risk of physical injury to another as burglary? From the evidence presented by the Government, I cannot conclude so. Because of that, the rule of lenity requires that I resolve this case in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p>The Government cites the fact that in 2006, 17,062 persons died from alcohol-related car crashes, and that 15,121 of those deaths involved drivers with blood-alcohol concentrations of 0.08 or higher. See Brief for United States 17. Drunk driving is surely a national problem of great concern. But the fact that it kills many people each year tells us very little about whether a single act of drunk driving \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" It may well be that an even greater number of deaths occurs annually to pedestrians crossing the street; but that hardly means that crossing the street presents a serious potential risk of injury. Where the issue is \"risk,\" the annual number of injuries from an activity must be compared with the annual incidents of the activity. Otherwise drunk driving could be said to pose a more serious risk of physical harm than murder. In addition, drunk driving is a combination of two activities: (1) drinking and (2) driving. If driving alone results in injury in a certain percentage of cases, it could hardly be said that the entirety of the risk posed by drunk driving can be attributed to the combination. And finally, injuries to the drunk drivers themselves must be excluded from the calculus, because the statute counts only injuries to other persons.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, we do not have these relevant statistics. And even if we did, we would still need to know similar statistics for burglary, which are probably even harder to come by. This does not mean that I will never be able to identify a crime that falls under the residual clause. For some crimes, the severity of the risk will be obvious. Crimes like negligent homicide, see ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 210.4 (1980), conspiracy to commit a violent crime, <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 5.03 (1985), inciting to riot, 18 U.S.C. \u00a72101, and the production of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1592</span> chemical weapons, \u00a7 229, certainly pose a more serious risk of physical injury to others than burglary. (By contrast, the Court's approach eliminates from the residual clause all negligent crimes, even those that entail a 100% risk of physical injury such as negligent homicide.) But I can do no more than guess as to whether drunk driving poses a more serious risk than burglary, and I will not condemn a man to a minimum of 15 years in prison on the basis of such speculation. See <i>Ladner v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105801\"><a href=\"/opinion/105801/ladner-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span>, 178, 79 S.Ct. 209, 3 L.Ed.2d 199 (1958).

The lower courts concluded that these offenses were crimes \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" and \"involve[d] conduct that present[ed] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>The Court does not hold that the maximum term of imprisonment that petitioner faced on his felony DUI convictions was less than one year.<sup>[1]</sup> Nor does the Court dispute that petitioner's offenses involved \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The only remaining question, therefore, is whether the risk presented by petitioner's qualifying DUI felony convictions was \"serious,\" <i>i.e.,</i> \"significant\" or \"important.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> Webster's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1593</span> Third New International Dictionary 2073 (hereinafter Webster's); (2002) 15 Oxford English Dictionary 15 (def. 6(a)) (2d ed.1989) (hereinafter OED). In my view, it was.</p>\n<p>Statistics dramatically show that driving under the influence of alcohol is very dangerous. Each year, approximately 15,000 fatal alcohol-related crashes occur, accounting for roughly 40% of all fatal crashes.<sup>[2]</sup> Approximately a quarter million people are injured annually in alcohol-related crashes.<sup>[3]</sup> The number of people who are killed each year by drunk drivers is far greater than the number of murders committed during any of the crimes specifically set out in the statutory provision at issue here, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u0097burglary, arson, extortion, and offenses involving the use of explosives.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Petitioner's qualifying offenses, moreover, fell within the statute only because he had been convicted of DUI on at least three prior occasions. As noted, petitioner had <i>a dozen</i> prior DUI convictions. Persons who repeatedly drive drunk present a greatly enhanced danger that they and others will be injured as a result.<sup>[5]</sup> In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1594</span> addition, it has been estimated that the ratio of DUI incidents to DUI arrests is between 250 to 1 and 2,000 to 1.<sup>[6]</sup> Accordingly, the risk presented by a 10th, 11th, and 12th DUI conviction may be viewed as the risk created by literally thousands of drunk-driving events. That risk was surely \"serious,\" and therefore petitioner's offenses fell squarely within the language of the statute.</p>\n<p>Moreover, taking the statutory language to mean what it says would not sweep in all DUI convictions. Most DUI convictions are not punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year and thus fall outside the scope of the statute.<sup>[7]</sup> Petitioner's convictions qualified only because of his extraordinary\u0097and, I would say, extraordinarily dangerous\u0097record of drunk driving.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that an offense does not fall within the residual clause unless it is \"roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risked posed,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1585, to the crimes specifically listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), <i>i.e.,</i> burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving the use of explosives. These crimes, according to the Court, \"all typically involve purposeful, `violent,' and `aggressive' conduct.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1586 (quoting 470 F.3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p>This interpretation cannot be squared with the text of the statute, which simply does not provide that an offense must be \"purposeful,\" \"violent,\" or \"aggressive\" in order to fall within the residual clause. Rather, after listing burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives offenses, the statute provides (in the residual clause) that an offense qualifies if it \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" Therefore, offenses falling within the residual clause must be similar to the named offenses in one respect only: They must, \"otherwise\"\u0097which is to say, \"in a different manner,\" 10 OED 984 (def. B(1)); see also Webster's 1598\u0097\"involve[] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" Requiring that an offense must also be \"purposeful,\" \"violent,\" or \"aggressive\" amounts to adding new elements to the statute, but we \"ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.\" <i>Bates v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118150\"><a href=\"/opinion/118150/bates-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 29, 118 S.Ct. 285, 139 L.Ed.2d 215 (1997).</p>\n<p>Each part of this additional, judicially added requirement presents other problems as well.</p>\n<p><i>Purposeful.</i> At least one State's DUI law requires proof of purposeful conduct. See <i>Tam v. State,</i> 232 Ga.App. 15, 16, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1414660\"><a href=\"/opinion/1414660/tam-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 52 (1998) (requiring proof of the intent to drive). In addition, many States recognize involuntary intoxication as a defense. See 4 R. Essen &amp; R. Erwin, Defense of Drunk Driving Cases: Criminal\u0097 Civil \u00a7 44.04 (2007). And even in States that do not require purposefulness, I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of DUI defendants purposefully drank before getting behind the wheel and were purposefully operating their vehicles at the time of apprehension. I suspect that many DUI statutes do not require proof of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1595</span> purposefulness because the element is almost always present, requiring proof of the element would introduce an unnecessary complication, and it would make no sense to preclude conviction of those defendants who were so drunk that they did not even realize that they were behind the wheel.</p>\n<p><i>Violent.</i> It is clear that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) is not limited to \"violent\" crimes, for if it were, it would be redundant. The prior subparagraph, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A), includes offenses that have as an element the use or threatened use of violence.</p>\n<p><i>Aggressive.</i> The concept of \"aggressive\" crimes is vague, and in any event, it is hardly apparent why DUI\u0097not to mention the species of felony DUI recidivism that resulted in petitioner's predicament\u0097is not \"aggressive.\" Driving can certainly involve \"aggressive\" conduct. Indeed, some States have created the offense of \"aggressive driving.\" See M. Savage, M. Sundeen, &amp; A. Teigen, Traffic Safety and Public Health: State Legislative Action 2007, Transportation Series (National Conference of State Legislatures, Dec. 2007, No. 32), p. 17, and App. J, online at http:// www.ncsl.org/print/transportation/07traffic safety.pdf. Most States have a toll-free telephone number to call to report \"aggressive\" driving. See Campaign Safe &amp; Sober, Phone Numbers for Reporting Impaired, Aggressive, or Unsafe Driving, online at http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/ outreach/safesobr/16qp/phone.html.</p>\n<p>The Court defends its new statutory element on the ground that a defendant who merely engages in felony drunk driving is not likely to be \"the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1587. The Court cites no empirical support for this conclusion, and its accuracy is not self-evident. Petitioner's pattern of behavior may or may not be typical of those defendants who have enough DUI convictions to qualify under N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 66-8-102(G) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), but the example of his behavior in this case\u0097pointing a gun at his aunt's head and repeatedly pulling the trigger\u0097should surely be enough to counsel against uncritical reliance on stereotypes about \"the type\" of people who commit felony DUI violations.</p>\n<p>Defendants who qualify for an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) based (in whole or in part) on felony DUI convictions share at least three characteristics that are relevant for present purposes. First, they are persons who, in the judgment of Congress, cannot be trusted to use a firearm responsibly. In order to qualify for an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e), a defendant must of course be convicted of violating the felon-in-possession statute, \u00a7 922(g) (2000 ed.). The felon-in-possession statute necessarily rests on the judgment that a person with a prior felony conviction cannot be trusted with a firearm. See <i>Caron v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118233\"><a href=\"/opinion/118233/caron-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 315, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (1998) (\"Congress meant to keep guns away from all offenders who, the Federal Government feared, might cause harm ...\"). And there is no dispute that a prior felony DUI conviction qualifies as a felony under the felon-in-possession law. If Congress thought that a person with a prior felony DUI conviction is not \"the kind of person\" who is likely to use a gun unlawfully, why would Congress have made it a crime for such a person to possess a gun?</p>\n<p>Second, defendants with DUI convictions that are counted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) are likely to have serious alcohol abuse problems. As previously mentioned, ordinary DUI convictions are generally not counted under \u00a7 924(e) because they are not punishable by imprisonment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1596</span> for more than a year. Such penalties are generally reserved for persons, like petitioner, with a record of repeated DUI violations. See National Conference of State Legislatures, <i>supra.</i> Such individuals are very likely to have serious alcohol abuse problems and a propensity to engage in irresponsible conduct while under the influence. Alcohol use often precedes violent crimes, see, <i>e.g.,</i> Roizen, Epidemiological Issues in Alcohol-Related Violence, in 13 Recent Developments in Alcoholism 7, 8-9 (M. Galanter ed.1997), and thus there is reason to worry about the misuse of firearms by defendants whose alcohol abuse problems are serious enough to result in felony DUI convictions.</p>\n<p>Third, defendants with DUI convictions that are counted under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) have either (a) such serious alcohol abuse problems that they have at least three prior felony DUI convictions or (b) both one or two felony DUI convictions and one or two offenses that fall under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) (offenses that have \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\") or that are specifically set out in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (burglary, arson, extortion, or an explosives offense). Defendants with three felony DUI convictions are likely to be super-DUI-recidivists like petitioner. Defendants with a combination of felony DUI and other qualifying convictions\u0097for example, convictions for assault or burglary\u0097are persons who, even by the Court's lights, could be classified as \"the kind of person who might deliberately point [a] gun and pull the trigger.\"</p>\n<p>Unlike the Court, I cannot say that persons with these characteristics are less likely to use a gun illegally than are persons convicted of other qualifying felonies.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA's concurrence takes a different approach, but his analysis is likewise flawed. Justice SCALIA would hold (a) that an offense does not fall within the residual clause unless it presents a risk that is at least as great as that presented by the least dangerous of the enumerated offenses; (b) that burglary is the least dangerous of the enumerated offenses; (c) that the relevant measure of risk is the risk that the typical burglary, DUI, etc. would result in injury; and (d) that the risk presented by an incident of DUI is less than the risk presented by a burglary.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, like the Court, does not follow the statutory language. The statute says that offenses falling within the residual clause must present \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" The statute does not say that these offenses must present at least as much risk as the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p>The statute also does not say, as Justice SCALIA would hold, that the relevant risk is the risk that each incident of DUI will result in injury. I see no basis for concluding that Congress was not also concerned with the risk faced by potential victims, particularly since the statute explicitly refers to \"potential risk.\" Drunk driving is regarded as a severe societal problem in large measure because of the very large number of victims it produces each year.</p>\n<p>Finally, Justice SCALIA's conclusion that burglary is the least risky of the enumerated offenses is based on a procrustean reading of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This provision refers, without qualification, to \"extortion.\" In his dissent in <i>James v. United States,</i> 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (2007), Justice SCALIA concluded that many forms of extortion are \"inherently <i>unlikely</i> to cause physical harm.\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct., at 1594-95 (emphasis in original). Only by finding that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1597</span> term \"extortion\" in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) really means only certain forms of extortion was Justice SCALIA able to come to the conclusion that burglary is the least risky of the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p>For all these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Tenth Circuit.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  <i>United States v.

During that same 11-year period, the highest number of murders committed in the course of burglary was 123, the number of murders committed in the course of arson peaked at 105, and the number of murders involving explosives topped out at 14\u0097all in 1996. See Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports/Crime in the United States (Ann.Reps. 1996-2006), online at http://www. fbi.gov./ucr/ucr.htm#cius. While murders committed in the course of extortion were not separately reported, common sense and the fact that the total number of murders was similar to the number of fatal alcohol-related crashes at least after 1997 indicates that murders involving extortion would not rival deaths in alcohol-related auto accidents. Even if one were to expand beyond murders to all fatalities and even injuries, it is estimated that arson causes the relatively small number of 475 deaths and over 2,000 injuries annually.
