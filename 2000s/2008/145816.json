Saharsky, Assistant to the Solicitor General, Daniel S. Goodman, Attorney, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>For certain federal drug offenses, the Controlled Substances Act mandates a minimum sentence of imprisonment for 10 years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). That minimum doubles to 20 years for defendants previously convicted of a \"felony drug offense.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The question in this case is whether a state drug offense classified as a misdemeanor, but punishable by more than one year's imprisonment, is a \"felony drug offense\" as that term is used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>Two statutory definitions figure in our decision. Section 802(13) defines the unadorned term \"felony\" to mean any \"offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\" Section 802(44) defines the compound term \"felony drug offense\" to mean an offense involving specified drugs that is \"punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country.\"</p>\n<p>The term \"felony drug offense\" contained in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)'s provision for a 20-year minimum sentence, we hold, is defined exclusively by \u00a7 802(44) and does not incorporate \u00a7 802(13)'s definition of \"felony.\" A state drug offense punishable by more than one year therefore qualifies as a \"felony drug offense,\" even if state law classifies the offense as a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Keith Lavon Burgess pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846.<sup>[1]</sup> A <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1576</span> violation of \u00a7 841(a) involving that quantity of cocaine base ordinarily carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The minimum sentence increases to 20 years, however, if the crime follows a prior conviction for a \"felony drug offense.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Burgess had previously been convicted of possessing cocaine in violation of S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 44-53-370(c) and (d)(1) (2002 and Supp.2007). Although that offense carried a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment, South Carolina classified it as a misdemeanor. \u00a7 44-53-370(d)(1). Burgess' prior South Carolina conviction, the Government urged, raised the minimum sentence for his federal conviction to 20 years. The enhancement was mandatory, the Government maintained, because Congress defined \"felony drug offense\" to include state cocaine offenses \"punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Burgess contested the enhancement of his federal sentence. The term \"felony drug offense,\" he argued, incorporates the term \"felony,\" a word separately defined in \u00a7 802(13) to mean \"any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\" A prior drug offense does not rank as a \"felony drug offense,\" he contended, unless it is (1) classified as a felony under the law of the punishing jurisdiction, per \u00a7 802(13); and (2) punishable by more than one year's imprisonment, per \u00a7 802(44).</p>\n<p>Rejecting Burgess' argument, the District Court ruled that \u00a7 802(44) alone controls the meaning of \"felony drug offense\" as that term is used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Although the District Court's ruling subjected Burgess to a 20-year minimum sentence, the Government moved for a downward departure based on Burgess' substantial assistance in another prosecution. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The court granted the motion and sentenced Burgess to 156 months' imprisonment followed by ten years' supervised release.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. The \"`commonsense way to interpret \"felony drug offense,\"'\" that court said, \"`is by reference to the definition in \u00a7 802(44).'\" 478 F.3d 658, 662 (2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Roberson,</i> 459 F.3d 39, 52 (C.A.1 2006)). The Fourth Circuit found nothing in the \"plain language or statutory scheme... to indicate that Congress intended `felony drug offense' also to incorporate the definition [of `felony'] in \u00a7 802(13).\" 478 F.3d, at 662.</p>\n<p>Burgess, proceeding <i>pro se,</i> petitioned for a writ of certiorari. We granted the writ, 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 740, 169 L.Ed.2d 578 (2007), to resolve a split among the Circuits on the question Burgess presents: Does a drug crime classified as a misdemeanor by state law, but punishable by more than one year's imprisonment, rank as a \"felony drug offense\" under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)? Compare 478 F.3d 658 (case below), and <i>Roberson,</i> 459 F.3d 39 (\u00a7 802(44) provides exclusive definition of \"felony drug offense\"), with <i>United States v. West,</i> 393 F.3d 1302 (C.A.D.C.2005) (both \u00a7 802(13) and \u00a7 802(44) limit meaning of \"felony drug offense\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1577</span> II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <i>et seq.,</i> contains two definitions central to the dispute before us; they bear repetition in full. Section 802(13) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The term `felony' means any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Section 802(44) states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The term `felony drug offense' means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, anabolic steroids, or depressant or stimulant substances.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Burgess argues here, as he did below, that \"felony drug offense,\" as used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), should be construed to incorporate both the definition of \"felony\" in \u00a7 802(13) and the definition of \"felony drug offense\" in \u00a7 802(44). Under his reading, the \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) enhancement is triggered only when the prior conviction is both \"classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony,\" \u00a7 802(13), and \"punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,\" \u00a7 802(44).</p>\n<p>The Government, in contrast, reads \u00a7 802(44) to provide the exclusive definition of \"felony drug offense.\" Under the Government's reading, all defendants whose prior drug crimes were punishable by more than one year in prison would be subject to the \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) enhancement, regardless of the punishing jurisdiction's classification of the offense.</p>\n<p>The Government's reading, we are convinced, correctly interprets the statutory text and context. Section 802(44) defines the precise phrase used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)\u0097\"felony drug offense.\" \"Statutory definitions control the meaning of statutory words ... in the usual case.\" <i>Lawson v. Suwannee Fruit &amp; S.S. Co.,</i> 336 U.S. 198, 201, 69 S.Ct. 503, 93 L.Ed. 611 (1949). See also <i>Stenberg v. Carhart,</i> 530 U.S. 914, 942, 120 S.Ct. 2597, 147 L.Ed.2d 743 (2000) (\"When a statute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that definition....\"); 2A N. Singer &amp; J. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:7, pp. 298-299, and nn. 2-3 (7th ed.2007) (hereinafter Singer).</p>\n<p>The CSA, to be sure, also defines the term \"felony.\" The language and structure of the statute, however, indicate that Congress used the phrase \"felony drug offense\" as a term of art defined by \u00a7 802(44) without reference to \u00a7 802(13). First, Congress stated that \"[t]he term `felony drug offense' <i>means</i> an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\" \u00a7 802(44) (emphasis added). \"As a rule, [a] definition which declares what a term `means' ... excludes any meaning that is not stated.\" <i>Colautti v. Franklin,</i> 439 U.S. 379, 392-393, n. 10, 99 S.Ct. 675, 58 L.Ed.2d 596 (1979) (some internal quotation marks omitted). See also <i>Groman v. Commissioner,</i> 302 U.S. 82, 86, 58 S.Ct. 108, 82 L.Ed. 63 (1937); 2A Singer \u00a7 47:7, p. 306, and n. 20.</p>\n<p>Second, the term \"felony\" is commonly defined to mean a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a) (classifying crimes with a maximum term of more than one year as felonies); Black's Law Dictionary 651 (8th ed.2004) (defining \"felony\" as \"[a] serious crime usu[ally] punishable by imprisonment for more than one year or by death\"). Section 802(44)'s definition of \"felony drug offense\" as \"an offense ... punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,\" in short, leaves no blank to be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1578</span> filled by \u00a7 802(13) or any other definition of \"felony.\"</p>\n<p>Third, if Congress wanted \"felony drug offense\" to incorporate the definition of \"felony\" in \u00a7 802(13), it easily could have written \u00a7 802(44) to state: \"The term `felony drug offense' means a <i>felony</i> that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year ....\" See <i>Roberson,</i> 459 F.3d, at 52. Congress has often used that drafting technique\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> repeating a discretely defined word\u0097when it intends to incorporate the definition of a particular word into the definition of a compound expression. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1672(a)-(b) (defining \"earnings\" and then defining \"disposable earnings\" as \"that part of the earnings\" meeting certain criteria); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(c)(3)-(4) (defining \"transaction\" and then defining \"financial transaction\" as \"a transaction which\" meets other criteria); \u00a7 1961(1), (5) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (defining \"racketeering activity\" and then defining \"pattern of racketeering activity\" to require \"at least two acts of racketeering activity\").<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Fourth, our reading avoids anomalies that would arise if both 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(13) and \u00a7 802(44) governed application of the sentencing enhancement in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Notably, \u00a7 802(44) includes foreign offenses punishable by more than one year, while \u00a7 802(13) includes only federal and state offenses. Incorporation of \u00a7 802(13) into \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) would exclude enhancement based on a foreign offense, notwithstanding the express inclusion of foreign offenses in \u00a7 802(44)'s definition of \"felony drug offense.\" Furthermore, some States and many foreign jurisdictions do not label offenses as felonies or misdemeanors. See N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:1-4 (West 2005); Me. Rev.Stat. Ann., Tit. 17-A, \u00a7 1252 (Supp. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1579</span> 2007); Brief for United States 35. Burgess' compound definition of \"felony drug offense\" leaves unanswered the appropriate classification of drug convictions in those jurisdictions. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> 937 F.2d 68, 70 (C.A.2 1991) (relying on New Jersey common law to determine that the State classifies offenses punishable by more than one year as felonies). No such uncertainty arises under the precise definition Congress provided in \u00a7 802(44).</p>\n<p>Finally, reading \u00a7 802(44) as the exclusive definition of \"felony drug offense\" hardly renders \u00a7 802(13) extraneous. Section 802(13) serves to define \"felony\" for many CSA provisions using that unadorned term. See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7\u00a7 824(a)(2) (revocation of license to manufacture controlled substances upon conviction of a felony), 843(b) (use of a communication facility to commit a felony), 843(d)(1)-(2) (sentencing enhancements), 843(e) (prohibition on engaging in transactions involving listed chemicals upon conviction of a felony involving those chemicals), 848(c)(1) (definition of \"continuing criminal enterprise\"), 848(e)(1)(B) (mandatory minimum term for killing a law enforcement officer to avoid prosecution for a felony), 853(d) (rebuttable presumption that property acquired during commission of certain felonies is subject to criminal forfeiture), 878(a)(3) (authority to make warrantless arrest where there is probable cause to believe a felony has been committed).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The drafting history of the CSA reinforces our reading of \u00a7 802(44) as the exclusive definition of \"felony drug offense.\" In 1988, Congress first used the term \"felony drug offense\" to describe the type of prior conviction that would trigger a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). See National Narcotics Leadership Act, Pub.L. 100-690, \u00a7 6452(a), 102 Stat. 4371. The 1988 definition of the term was placed within \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) itself; the definition covered \"an offense that is a felony under any ... Federal law... or ... any law of a State or a foreign country\" prohibiting or restricting conduct relating to certain types of drugs. \u00a7 6452(a)(2), <i>ibid.</i><sup>[4]</sup> But in 1994, Congress amended the definition, replacing \"an offense that is a <i>felony</i> under ... any law of a State,\" <i>ibid.</i> (emphasis added), with \"an offense that is <i>punishable by imprisonment for more than one year</i> under any law ... of a State,\" Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Pub.L. 103-322, \u00a7 90105(c)-(d), 108 Stat.1988 (emphasis added). In lieu of incorporation within \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), the new definition was placed in a discrete \u00a7 802 definition section. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>This alteration lends considerable support to our reading of the statute. Before 1994, the definition of \"felony drug offense\" depended on the vagaries of state-law classifications of offenses as felonies or misdemeanors. The 1994 amendments replaced that definition with a uniform federal standard based on the authorized length of imprisonment. By recognizing \u00a7 802(44) as the exclusive definition of \"felony drug offense,\" our reading serves an evident purpose of the 1994 revision: to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1580</span> bring a measure of uniformity to the application of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) by eliminating disparities based on divergent state classifications of offenses.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Burgess reads the 1994 alteration as merely adding a length-of-imprisonment requirement to a definition that already required\u0097and, he contends, continues to require\u0097designation of an offense as a felony by the punishing jurisdiction. That view, however, is difficult to square with Congress' deletion of the word \"felony\" and substitution of the phrase \"punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\"</p>\n<p>If Burgess were correct, moreover, the sole effect of the 1994 change would have been to exclude from the compass of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) the few drug offenses classified as felonies under the law of the punishing jurisdiction but subject to a sentence of one year or less. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-8.<sup>[5]</sup> See also Brief for Petitioner 15 (purpose of 1994 alteration was to eliminate enhancement for \"truly minor offenses\" nonetheless classified as felonies). Burgess concedes that under his reading of the statute \"the language that Congress added [in 1994] has very little practical effect,\" but defends his interpretation on the ground that Congress labeled the changes \"conforming amendments.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. See also 108 Stat. 1987; Brief for Petitioner 12.</p>\n<p>Burgess places more weight on the \"Conforming Amendments\" caption than it can bear. Congress did not disavow any intent to make substantive changes; rather, the amendments were \"conforming\" because they harmonized sentencing provisions in the CSA and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, 84 Stat. 1285, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 951 <i>et seq.</i> Treating the amendments as nonsubstantive would be inconsistent with their text, not to mention Burgess' own view that \u00a7 802(44) added a new length-of-imprisonment requirement to the definition of \"felony drug offense.\"</p>\n<p>In sum, the 1994 alteration replaced a patchwork of state and foreign classifications with a uniform federal standard based on the authorized term of imprisonment. Burgess' argument that Congress added something\u0097the definition now in \u00a7 802(44)\u0097but subtracted nothing encounters formidable impediments: the text and history of the statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Burgess urges us to apply the rule of lenity in determining whether the term \"felony drug offense\" incorporates \u00a7 802(13)'s definition of \"felony.\" \"[T]he touchstone of the rule of lenity is statutory ambiguity.\" <i>Bifulco v. United States,</i> 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"The rule comes into operation at the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed,\" <i>Callanan v. United States,</i> 364 U.S. 587, 596, 81 S.Ct. 321, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961), and \"applies only when, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an ambiguous statute,\" <i>United States v. Shabani,</i> 513 U.S. 10, 17, 115 S.Ct. 382, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994). Here, Congress expressly defined the term \"felony drug offense.\" The definition is coherent, complete, and by all signs exclusive. Accordingly, there is no ambiguity for the rule of lenity to resolve.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1581</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although Title 21 of the United States Code has not been enacted as positive law, we refer to it rather than the underlying provisions of the Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <i>et seq.,</i> for the sake of simplicity. The relevant provisions of Title 21 have not changed from the time of Burgess' offense, and all citations are to the 2000 edition through Supplement V.</p>\n<p>[2]  Burgess received a one-year suspended sentence for his South Carolina conviction, but does not dispute that the offense was \"<i>punishable</i> by imprisonment for more than one year.\" \u00a7 802(44) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[3]  Burgess offers four examples of defined words nested within defined phrases where, he asserts, the definition of the word is embraced within the phrase, although the word is not repeated in the definition of the phrase. See Reply Brief 11-12; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 11-12. In all but one of these examples, however, the definition of the phrase is introduced by the word \"includes.\" See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(4), (6), (7); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2266(3)-(4). \"[T]he word `includes' is usually a term of enlargement, and not of limitation.\" 2A Singer \u00a7 47:7, p. 305 (some internal quotation marks omitted). Thus \"[a] term whose statutory definition declares what it `includes' is more susceptible to extension of meaning... than where\"\u0097as in \u00a7 802(44)\u0097\"the definition declares what a term `means.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> See also <i>Groman v. Commissioner,</i> 302 U.S. 82, 86, 58 S.Ct. 108, 82 L.Ed. 63 (1937) (\"[W]hen an exclusive definition is intended the word `means' is employed, ... whereas here the word used is `includes.'\").\n</p>\n<p>Burgess' fourth example is also inapposite. The definition of \"debtor's principal residence\" in the Bankruptcy Code, he notes, does not repeat the word \"debtor,\" itself a discretely defined term. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(13), (13A) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Section 101(13A) states: \"The term `debtor's principal residence'\u0097(A) means a residential structure, including incidental property, without regard to whether that structure is attached to real property; and (B) includes an individual condominium or cooperative unit, a mobile or manufactured home, or trailer.\" That definition, unlike 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44), is incomplete on its face because nothing in the definition of \"debtor's principal residence\" elucidates the word \"debtor's.\" Given that void and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(13A)'s placement in the Bankruptcy Code, it is reasonable to assume that Congress wanted courts to read the phrase \"debtor's principal residence\" in light of the separate definition of \"debtor.\" Indeed, a contrary reading would yield the absurd result that <i>every</i> residential structure is a \"debtor's principal residence.\"</p>\n<p>At most, therefore, Burgess' fourth example illustrates the importance of considering context in applying canons of statutory construction. There may well be other examples lurking in the United States Code of nested terms that draw their meaning from two different statutory provisions without repeating one term in the definition of the other. But \"felony drug offense\" is not among them.</p>\n<p>[4]  The full definition stated:\n</p>\n<p>\"For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `felony drug offense' means an offense that is a felony under any provision of this title or any other Federal law that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances or a felony under any law of a State or a foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances.\" National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988, Pub.L. 100-690, \u00a7 6452(a)(2), 102 Stat. 4371.</p>\n<p>[5]  The examples provided by Burgess of such atypical categorization, Brief for Petitioner 22, all carry maximum sentences of exactly one year.

Argued March 24, 2008\u2014Decided April 16, 2008\nThe Controlled Substances Act (CSA) doubles the mandatory minimum\n  sentence for certain federal drug crimes if the defendant was previ-\n  ously convicted of a \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d 21 U. S. C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(A).\n  Section 802(13) defines the unadorned term \u201cfelony\u201d to mean any \u201cof-\n  fense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony,\u201d while\n  \u00a7802(44) defines the compound term \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d to \u201cmea[n]\n  an offense [involving specified drugs] that is punishable by impris-\n  onment for more than one year under any law of the United States or\n  of a State or foreign country.\u201d\n     Petitioner Burgess pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy to\n  possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, an\n  offense that ordinarily carries a 10-year mandatory minimum sen-\n  tence. Burgess had a prior South Carolina cocaine possession convic-\n  tion, which carried a maximum sentence of two years but was classi-\n  fied as a misdemeanor under state law. The Federal Government\n  argued that Burgess\u2019 minimum federal sentence should be enhanced\n  to 20 years under \u00a7841(b)(1)(A) because his South Carolina conviction\n  was punishable by more than one year\u2019s imprisonment. Burgess\n  countered that because \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d incorporates the term\n  \u201cfelony,\u201d a word separately defined in \u00a7802(13), a prior drug offense\n  does not warrant an enhanced \u00a7841(b)(1)(A) sentence unless it is both\n  (1) classified as a felony under the law of the punishing jurisdiction,\n  per \u00a7802(13); and (2) punishable by more than one year\u2019s imprison-\n  ment, per \u00a7802(44). Rejecting that argument, the District Court\n  ruled that \u00a7802(44) alone controls the meaning of \u201cfelony drug of-\n  fense\u201d under \u00a7841(b)(1)(A). The Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the term \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d in \u00a7841(b)(1)(A) is defined\n exclusively by \u00a7802(44) and does not incorporate \u00a7802(13)\u2019s definition\n2                     BURGESS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    of \u201cfelony,\u201d a state drug offense punishable by more than one year\n    qualifies as a \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d even if state law classifies the of-\n    fense as a misdemeanor. Pp. 4\u201311.\n        (a) The CSA\u2019s language and structure indicate that Congress used\n    \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as a term of art defined by \u00a7802(44) without ref-\n    erence to \u00a7802(13). First, a definition such as \u00a7802(44)\u2019s that declares\n    what a term \u201cmeans\u201d generally excludes any meaning that is not\n    stated. E.g., Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 392\u2013393, n. 10.\n    Second, because \u201cfelony\u201d is commonly defined to mean a crime pun-\n    ishable by imprisonment for more than one year, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C.\n    \u00a73559(a), \u00a7802(44)\u2019s definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as \u201can offense\n    . . . punishable by imprisonment for more than one year\u201d leaves no\n    blank for \u00a7802(13) to fill. Third, if Congress wanted \u201cfelony drug of-\n    fense\u201d to incorporate \u00a7802(13)\u2019s definition of \u201cfelony,\u201d it easily could\n    have written \u00a7802(44) to state: \u201cThe term \u2018felony drug offense\u2019 means\n    a felony that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year\n    . . . .\u201d Fourth, the Court\u2019s reading avoids anomalies that would arise\n    if both \u00a7\u00a7802(13) and 802(44) governed application of \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)\u2019s\n    sentencing enhancement. Section 802(13) includes only federal and\n    state offenses and would exclude enhancement based on a foreign of-\n    fense, notwithstanding the express inclusion of foreign offenses in\n    \u00a7841(b)(1)(A). Furthermore, Burgess\u2019 compound definition of \u201cfelony\n    drug offense\u201d leaves unanswered the appropriate classification of\n    drug convictions in state and foreign jurisdictions that do not label of-\n    fenses as felonies or misdemeanors. Finally, the Court\u2019s reading of\n    \u00a7802(44) hardly renders \u00a7802(13) extraneous; the latter section\n    serves to define \u201cfelony\u201d for the many CSA provisions using that un-\n    adorned term. Pp. 4\u20138.\n        (b) The CSA\u2019s drafting history reinforces the Court\u2019s reading. In\n    1988, Congress first defined \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as, inter alia, \u201can\n    offense that is a felony under . . . any law of a State\u201d (emphasis\n    added), but, in 1994, it amended the statutory definition to its pre-\n    sent form. By recognizing \u00a7802(44) as the exclusive definition of \u201cfel-\n    ony drug offense,\u201d the Court\u2019s reading serves an evident purpose of\n    the 1994 revision: to eliminate disparities resulting from divergent\n    state classifications of offenses by adopting a uniform federal stan-\n    dard based on the authorized term of imprisonment. By contrast,\n    Burgess\u2019 reading of the 1994 alteration as merely adding a length-of-\n    imprisonment requirement to a definition already requiring designa-\n    tion of an offense as a felony by the punishing jurisdiction would at-\n    tribute to the amendment little practical effect and encounters formi-\n    dable impediments: the statute\u2019s text and history. Pp. 8\u201310.\n        (c) Burgess\u2019 argument that the rule of lenity should be applied in\n    determining whether \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d incorporates \u00a7802(13)\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  definition of \u201cfelony\u201d is rejected. The touchstone of the rule of lenity\n  is statutory ambiguity. E.g., Bifulco v. United States, 447 U. S. 381,\n  387. Because Congress expressly defined \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d in a\n  manner that is coherent, complete, and by all signs exclusive, there is\n  no ambiguity for the rule of lenity to resolve here.

UNITED \n\n                  STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 16, 2008] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   For certain federal drug offenses, the Controlled Sub-\nstances Act mandates a minimum sentence of imprison-\nment for 10 years. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(A). That mini-\nmum doubles to 20 years for defendants previously\nconvicted of a \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d Ibid. The question in\nthis case is whether a state drug offense classified as a\nmisdemeanor, but punishable by more than one year\u2019s\nimprisonment, is a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as that term is\nused in \u00a7841(b)(1)(A).\n   Two statutory definitions figure in our decision. Section\n802(13) defines the unadorned term \u201cfelony\u201d to mean any\n\u201coffense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a\nfelony.\u201d Section 802(44) defines the compound term \u201cfel-\nony drug offense\u201d to mean an offense involving specified\ndrugs that is \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for more than\none year under any law of the United States or of a State\nor foreign country.\u201d\n   The term \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d contained in\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)\u2019s provision for a 20-year minimum sentence,\nwe hold, is defined exclusively by \u00a7802(44) and does not\n2                   BURGESS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nincorporate \u00a7802(13)\u2019s definition of \u201cfelony.\u201d A state drug\noffense punishable by more than one year therefore quali-\nfies as a \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d even if state law classifies\nthe offense as a misdemeanor.\n                               I\n   Petitioner Keith Lavon Burgess pleaded guilty in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of South\nCarolina to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute\n50 grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7841(a) and 846.1 A violation of \u00a7841(a) involving that\nquantity of cocaine base ordinarily carries a mandatory\nminimum sentence of 10 years. \u00a7841(b)(1)(A). The mini-\nmum sentence increases to 20 years, however, if the crime\nfollows a prior conviction for a \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d Ibid.\n   Burgess had previously been convicted of possessing\ncocaine in violation of S. C. Code Ann. \u00a744\u201353\u2013370(c) and\n(d)(1) (2002 and Supp. 2007). Although that offense car-\nried a maximum sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment,\nSouth Carolina classified it as a misdemeanor. \u00a744\u201353\u2013\n370(d)(1). Burgess\u2019 prior South Carolina conviction, the\nGovernment urged, raised the minimum sentence for his\nfederal conviction to 20 years. The enhancement was\nmandatory, the Government maintained, because Con-\ngress defined \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d to include state cocaine\noffenses \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for more than one\nyear.\u201d 21 U. S. C. \u00a7802(44).2\n   Burgess contested the enhancement of his federal sen-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Although Title 21 of the United States Code has not been enacted as\n\npositive law, we refer to it rather than the underlying provisions of the\nControlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, as amended, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7801\net seq., for the sake of simplicity. The relevant provisions of Title 21\nhave not changed from the time of Burgess\u2019 offense, and all citations\nare to the 2000 edition through Supplement V.\n   2 Burgess received a one-year suspended sentence for his South Caro-\n\nlina conviction, but does not dispute that the offense was \u201cpunishable\nby imprisonment for more than one year.\u201d \u00a7802(44) (emphasis added).\n                   Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)              3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ntence. The term \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d he argued, incorpo-\nrates the term \u201cfelony,\u201d a word separately defined in\n\u00a7802(13) to mean \u201cany Federal or State offense classified\nby applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\u201d A prior\ndrug offense does not rank as a \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d he\ncontended, unless it is (1) classified as a felony under the\nlaw of the punishing jurisdiction, per \u00a7802(13); and (2)\npunishable by more than one year\u2019s imprisonment, per\n\u00a7802(44).\n   Rejecting Burgess\u2019 argument, the District Court ruled\nthat \u00a7802(44) alone controls the meaning of \u201cfelony drug\noffense\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7841(b)(1)(A). Although\nthe District Court\u2019s ruling subjected Burgess to a 20-year\nminimum sentence, the Government moved for a down-\nward departure based on Burgess\u2019 substantial assistance\nin another prosecution. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(e) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. V). The court granted the motion and sentenced\nBurgess to 156 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by ten\nyears\u2019 supervised release.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit affirmed. The \u201c \u2018commonsense way to interpret\n\u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d \u2019 \u201d that court said, \u201c \u2018is by reference to\nthe definition in \u00a7802(44).\u2019 \u201d 478 F. 3d 658, 662 (2007)\n(quoting United States v. Roberson, 459 F. 3d 39, 52 (CA1\n2006)). The Fourth Circuit found nothing in the \u201cplain\nlanguage or statutory scheme . . . to indicate that Con-\ngress intended \u2018felony drug offense\u2019 also to incorporate the\ndefinition [of \u2018felony\u2019] in \u00a7802(13).\u201d 478 F. 3d, at 662.\n   Burgess, proceeding pro se, petitioned for a writ of cer-\ntiorari. We granted the writ, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), to\nresolve a split among the Circuits on the question Burgess\npresents: Does a drug crime classified as a misdemeanor\nby state law, but punishable by more than one year\u2019s\nimprisonment, rank as a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d under 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)? Compare 478 F. 3d 658 (case be-\nlow), and Roberson, 459 F. 3d 39 (\u00a7802(44) provides exclu-\n4                BURGESS v.

S. C. \u00a7801\net seq., contains two definitions central to the dispute\nbefore us; they bear repetition in full. Section 802(13)\nprovides:\n    \u201cThe term \u2018felony\u2019 means any Federal or State offense\n    classified by applicable Federal or State law as a fel-\n    ony.\u201d\nSection 802(44) states:\n    \u201cThe term \u2018felony drug offense\u2019 means an offense that\n    is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year\n    under any law of the United States or of a State or\n    foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct re-\n    lating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, anabolic steroids,\n    or depressant or stimulant substances.\u201d\n  Burgess argues here, as he did below, that \u201cfelony drug\noffense,\u201d as used in \u00a7841(b)(1)(A), should be construed to\nincorporate both the definition of \u201cfelony\u201d in \u00a7802(13) and\nthe definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d in \u00a7802(44). Under\nhis reading, the \u00a7841(b)(1)(A) enhancement is triggered\nonly when the prior conviction is both \u201cclassified by appli-\ncable Federal or State law as a felony,\u201d \u00a7802(13), and\n\u201cpunishable by imprisonment for more than one year,\u201d\n\u00a7802(44).\n  The Government, in contrast, reads \u00a7802(44) to provide\nthe exclusive definition of \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d Under the\nGovernment\u2019s reading, all defendants whose prior drug\ncrimes were punishable by more than one year in prison\nwould be subject to the \u00a7841(b)(1)(A) enhancement, re-\ngardless of the punishing jurisdiction\u2019s classification of the\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffense.\n   The Government\u2019s reading, we are convinced, correctly\ninterprets the statutory text and context. Section 802(44)\ndefines the precise phrase used in \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)\u2014\u201cfelony\ndrug offense.\u201d \u201cStatutory definitions control the meaning\nof statutory words . . . in the usual case.\u201d Lawson v.

Singer, Statutes\nand Statutory Construction \u00a747:7, pp. 298\u2013299, and nn. 2\u2013\n3 (7th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Singer).\n   The CSA, to be sure, also defines the term \u201cfelony.\u201d The\nlanguage and structure of the statute, however, indicate\nthat Congress used the phrase \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as a\nterm of art defined by \u00a7802(44) without reference to\n\u00a7802(13). First, Congress stated that \u201c[t]he term \u2018felony\ndrug offense\u2019 means an offense that is punishable by im-\nprisonment for more than one year.\u201d \u00a7802(44) (emphasis\nadded). \u201cAs a rule, [a] definition which declares what a\nterm \u2018means\u2019 . . . excludes any meaning that is not stated.\u201d\nColautti v.

S. 82, 86 (1937); 2A Singer\n\u00a747:7, p. 306, and n. 20.\n   Second, the term \u201cfelony\u201d is commonly defined to mean a\ncrime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\nSee, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(a) (classifying crimes with a\nmaximum term of more than one year as felonies); Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 651 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201cfelony\u201d as \u201c[a]\nserious crime usu[ally] punishable by imprisonment for\nmore than one year or by death\u201d). Section 802(44)\u2019s defini-\ntion of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as \u201can offense . . . punishable\nby imprisonment for more than one year,\u201d in short, leaves\nno blank to be filled by \u00a7802(13) or any other definition of\n\u201cfelony.\u201d\n6                   BURGESS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Third, if Congress wanted \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d to incor-\nporate the definition of \u201cfelony\u201d in \u00a7802(13), it easily could\nhave written \u00a7802(44) to state: \u201cThe term \u2018felony drug\noffense\u2019 means a felony that is punishable by imprison-\nment for more than one year . . . .\u201d See Roberson, 459\nF. 3d, at 52. Congress has often used that drafting tech-\nnique\u2014i.e., repeating a discretely defined word\u2014when it\nintends to incorporate the definition of a particular word\ninto the definition of a compound expression. See, e.g., 15\nU. S.

See Reply Brief 11\u201312; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 11\u201312. In all but\none of these examples, however, the definition of the phrase is intro-\nduced by the word \u201cincludes.\u201d See 2 U. S. C. \u00a71301(4), (6), (7); 18\nU. S. C. \u00a72266(3)\u2013(4). \u201c[T]he word \u2018includes\u2019 is usually a term of\nenlargement, and not of limitation.\u201d 2A Singer \u00a747:7, p. 305 (some\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Thus \u201c[a] term whose statutory\ndefinition declares what it \u2018includes\u2019 is more susceptible to extension of\nmeaning . . . than where\u201d\u2014as in \u00a7802(44)\u2014\u201cthe definition declares\nwhat a term \u2018means.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. See also Groman v. Commissioner, 302\nU. S. 82, 86 (1937) (\u201c[W]hen an exclusive definition is intended the\nword \u2018means\u2019 is employed, . . . whereas here the word used is \u2018in-\ncludes.\u2019 \u201d).\n   Burgess\u2019 fourth example is also inapposite. The definition of \u201cdebtor\u2019s\nprincipal residence\u201d in the Bankruptcy Code, he notes, does not repeat\nthe word \u201cdebtor,\u201d itself a discretely defined term. See 11 U. S. C.\n\u00a7101(13), (13A) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Section 101(13A) states: \u201cThe term\n\u2018debtor\u2019s principal residence\u2019\u2014(A) means a residential structure,\nincluding incidental property, without regard to whether that structure\nis attached to real property; and (B) includes an individual condomin-\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

C. \u00a7802(13) and \u00a7802(44) governed applica-\ntion of the sentencing enhancement in \u00a7841(b)(1)(A).\nNotably, \u00a7802(44) includes foreign offenses punishable by\nmore than one year, while \u00a7802(13) includes only federal\nand state offenses.        Incorporation of \u00a7802(13) into\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(A) would exclude enhancement based on a\nforeign offense, notwithstanding the express inclusion of\nforeign offenses in \u00a7802(44)\u2019s definition of \u201cfelony drug\noffense.\u201d Furthermore, some States and many foreign\njurisdictions do not label offenses as felonies or misde-\nmeanors. See N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a72C:1\u20134 (West 2005); Me.\nRev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17\u2013A, \u00a71252 (Supp. 2007); Brief for\nUnited States 35. Burgess\u2019 compound definition of \u201cfelony\ndrug offense\u201d leaves unanswered the appropriate classifi-\ncation of drug convictions in those jurisdictions. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Brown, 937 F. 2d 68, 70 (CA2 1991) (rely-\ning on New Jersey common law to determine that the\nState classifies offenses punishable by more than one year\nas felonies). No such uncertainty arises under the precise\ndefinition Congress provided in \u00a7802(44).\n   Finally, reading \u00a7802(44) as the exclusive definition of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nium or cooperative unit, a mobile or manufactured home, or trailer.\u201d\nThat definition, unlike 21 U. S. C. \u00a7802(44), is incomplete on its face\nbecause nothing in the definition of \u201cdebtor\u2019s principal residence\u201d\nelucidates the word \u201cdebtor\u2019s.\u201d Given that void and 11 U. S. C.\n\u00a7101(13A)\u2019s placement in the Bankruptcy Code, it is reasonable to\nassume that Congress wanted courts to read the phrase \u201cdebtor\u2019s\nprincipal residence\u201d in light of the separate definition of \u201cdebtor.\u201d\nIndeed, a contrary reading would yield the absurd result that every\nresidential structure is a \u201cdebtor\u2019s principal residence.\u201d\n   At most, therefore, Burgess\u2019 fourth example illustrates the impor-\ntance of considering context in applying canons of statutory construc-\ntion. There may well be other examples lurking in the United States\nCode of nested terms that draw their meaning from two different\nstatutory provisions without repeating one term in the definition of the\nother. But \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d is not among them.\n8                   BURGESS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cfelony drug offense\u201d hardly renders \u00a7802(13) extraneous.\nSection 802(13) serves to define \u201cfelony\u201d for many CSA\nprovisions using that unadorned term.             See, e.g.,\n\u00a7\u00a7824(a)(2) (revocation of license to manufacture con-\ntrolled substances upon conviction of a felony), 843(b) (use\nof a communication facility to commit a felony), 843(d)(1)\u2013\n(2) (sentencing enhancements), 843(e) (prohibition on\nengaging in transactions involving listed chemicals upon\nconviction of a felony involving those chemicals), 848(c)(1)\n(definition    of    \u201ccontinuing     criminal  enterprise\u201d),\n848(e)(1)(B) (mandatory minimum term for killing a law\nenforcement officer to avoid prosecution for a felony),\n853(d) (rebuttable presumption that property acquired\nduring commission of certain felonies is subject to criminal\nforfeiture), 878(a)(3) (authority to make warrantless arrest\nwhere there is probable cause to believe a felony has been\ncommitted).\n                              B\n   The drafting history of the CSA reinforces our reading of\n\u00a7802(44) as the exclusive definition of \u201cfelony drug of-\nfense.\u201d In 1988, Congress first used the term \u201cfelony drug\noffense\u201d to describe the type of prior conviction that would\ntrigger a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence under\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(A). See National Narcotics Leadership Act,\nPub. L. 100\u2013690, \u00a76452(a), 102 Stat. 4371. The 1988\ndefinition of the term was placed within \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)\nitself; the definition covered \u201can offense that is a felony\nunder any . . . Federal law . . . or . . . any law of a State or\na foreign country\u201d prohibiting or restricting conduct relat-\ning to certain types of drugs. \u00a76452(a)(2), ibid.4 But in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The full definition stated:\n\n\u201cFor purposes of this subparagraph, the term \u2018felony drug offense\u2019\nmeans an offense that is a felony under any provision of this title or any\nother Federal law that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic\ndrugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances or a felony\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                    9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n1994, Congress amended the definition, replacing \u201can\noffense that is a felony under . . . any law of a State,\u201d ibid.\n(emphasis added), with \u201can offense that is punishable by\nimprisonment for more than one year under any law . . . of\na State,\u201d Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act,\nPub. L. 103\u2013322, \u00a790105(c)\u2013(d), 108 Stat. 1988 (emphasis\nadded). In lieu of incorporation within \u00a7841(b)(1)(A), the\nnew definition was placed in a discrete \u00a7802 definition\nsection. Ibid.\n   This alteration lends considerable support to our read-\ning of the statute. Before 1994, the definition of \u201cfelony\ndrug offense\u201d depended on the vagaries of state-law classi-\nfications of offenses as felonies or misdemeanors. The\n1994 amendments replaced that definition with a uniform\nfederal standard based on the authorized length of impris-\nonment. By recognizing \u00a7802(44) as the exclusive defini-\ntion of \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d our reading serves an evident\npurpose of the 1994 revision: to bring a measure of uni-\nformity to the application of \u00a7841(b)(1)(A) by eliminating\ndisparities based on divergent state classifications of\noffenses.\n   By contrast, Burgess reads the 1994 alteration as\nmerely adding a length-of-imprisonment requirement to a\ndefinition that already required\u2014and, he contends, con-\ntinues to require\u2014designation of an offense as a felony by\nthe punishing jurisdiction. That view, however, is difficult\nto square with Congress\u2019 deletion of the word \u201cfelony\u201d and\nsubstitution of the phrase \u201cpunishable by imprisonment\nfor more than one year.\u201d\n   If Burgess were correct, moreover, the sole effect of the\n1994 change would have been to exclude from the compass\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nunder any law of a State or a foreign country that prohibits or restricts\n\nconduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimu-\nlant substances.\u201d National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988, Pub. L. \n\n100\u2013690, \u00a76452(a)(2), 102 Stat. 4371. \n\n10                 BURGESS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nof \u00a7841(b)(1)(A) the few drug offenses classified as felonies\nunder the law of the punishing jurisdiction but subject to a\nsentence of one year or less. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6\u20138.5 See\nalso Brief for Petitioner 15 (purpose of 1994 alteration was\nto eliminate enhancement for \u201ctruly minor offenses\u201d none-\ntheless classified as felonies). Burgess concedes that\nunder his reading of the statute \u201cthe language that Con-\ngress added [in 1994] has very little practical effect,\u201d but\ndefends his interpretation on the ground that Congress\nlabeled the changes \u201cconforming amendments.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 8. See also 108 Stat. 1987; Brief for Petitioner\n12.\n   Burgess places more weight on the \u201cConforming\nAmendments\u201d caption than it can bear. Congress did not\ndisavow any intent to make substantive changes; rather,\nthe amendments were \u201cconforming\u201d because they harmo-\nnized sentencing provisions in the CSA and the Controlled\nSubstances Import and Export Act, 84 Stat. 1285, 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7951 et seq. Treating the amendments as nonsub-\nstantive would be inconsistent with their text, not to\nmention Burgess\u2019 own view that \u00a7802(44) added a new\nlength-of-imprisonment requirement to the definition of\n\u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d\n   In sum, the 1994 alteration replaced a patchwork of\nstate and foreign classifications with a uniform federal\nstandard based on the authorized term of imprisonment.\nBurgess\u2019 argument that Congress added something\u2014the\ndefinition now in \u00a7802(44)\u2014but subtracted nothing en-\ncounters formidable impediments: the text and history of\nthe statute.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The examples provided by Burgess of such atypical categorization,\n\nBrief for Petitioner 22, all carry maximum sentences of exactly one\nyear.

That minimum doubles to 20 years for defendants previously convicted of a \"felony drug offense.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The question in this case is whether a state drug offense classified as a misdemeanor, but punishable by more than one year's imprisonment, is a \"felony drug offense\" as that term is used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>Two statutory definitions figure in our decision. Section 802(13) defines the unadorned term \"felony\" to mean any \"offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\" Section 802(44) defines the compound term \"felony drug offense\" to mean an offense involving specified drugs that is \"punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country.\"</p>\n<p>The term \"felony drug offense\" contained in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)'s provision for a 20-year minimum sentence, we hold, is defined exclusively by \u00a7 802(44) and does not incorporate \u00a7 802(13)'s definition of \"felony.\" A state drug offense punishable by more than one year therefore qualifies as a \"felony drug offense,\" even if state law classifies the offense as a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Keith Lavon Burgess pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846.<sup>[1]</sup> A <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1576</span> violation of \u00a7 841(a) involving that quantity of cocaine base ordinarily carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The minimum sentence increases to 20 years, however, if the crime follows a prior conviction for a \"felony drug offense.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Burgess had previously been convicted of possessing cocaine in violation of S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 44-53-370(c) and (d)(1) (2002 and Supp.2007). Although that offense carried a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment, South Carolina classified it as a misdemeanor. \u00a7 44-53-370(d)(1). Burgess' prior South Carolina conviction, the Government urged, raised the minimum sentence for his federal conviction to 20 years. The enhancement was mandatory, the Government maintained, because Congress defined \"felony drug offense\" to include state cocaine offenses \"punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Burgess contested the enhancement of his federal sentence. The term \"felony drug offense,\" he argued, incorporates the term \"felony,\" a word separately defined in \u00a7 802(13) to mean \"any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\" A prior drug offense does not rank as a \"felony drug offense,\" he contended, unless it is (1) classified as a felony under the law of the punishing jurisdiction, per \u00a7 802(13); and (2) punishable by more than one year's imprisonment, per \u00a7 802(44).</p>\n<p>Rejecting Burgess' argument, the District Court ruled that \u00a7 802(44) alone controls the meaning of \"felony drug offense\" as that term is used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Although the District Court's ruling subjected Burgess to a 20-year minimum sentence, the Government moved for a downward departure based on Burgess' substantial assistance in another prosecution. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The court granted the motion and sentenced Burgess to 156 months' imprisonment followed by ten years' supervised release.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.

Section 802(13) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The term `felony' means any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Section 802(44) states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The term `felony drug offense' means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, anabolic steroids, or depressant or stimulant substances.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Burgess argues here, as he did below, that \"felony drug offense,\" as used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), should be construed to incorporate both the definition of \"felony\" in \u00a7 802(13) and the definition of \"felony drug offense\" in \u00a7 802(44). Under his reading, the \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) enhancement is triggered only when the prior conviction is both \"classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony,\" \u00a7 802(13), and \"punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,\" \u00a7 802(44).</p>\n<p>The Government, in contrast, reads \u00a7 802(44) to provide the exclusive definition of \"felony drug offense.\" Under the Government's reading, all defendants whose prior drug crimes were punishable by more than one year in prison would be subject to the \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) enhancement, regardless of the punishing jurisdiction's classification of the offense.</p>\n<p>The Government's reading, we are convinced, correctly interprets the statutory text and context. Section 802(44) defines the precise phrase used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)\u0097\"felony drug offense.\" \"Statutory definitions control the meaning of statutory words ... in the usual case.\" <i>Lawson v.

First, Congress stated that \"[t]he term `felony drug offense' <i>means</i> an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\" \u00a7 802(44) (emphasis added). \"As a rule, [a] definition which declares what a term `means' ... excludes any meaning that is not stated.\" <i>Colautti v.

See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a) (classifying crimes with a maximum term of more than one year as felonies); Black's Law Dictionary 651 (8th ed.2004) (defining \"felony\" as \"[a] serious crime usu[ally] punishable by imprisonment for more than one year or by death\"). Section 802(44)'s definition of \"felony drug offense\" as \"an offense ... punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,\" in short, leaves no blank to be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1578</span> filled by \u00a7 802(13) or any other definition of \"felony.\"</p>\n<p>Third, if Congress wanted \"felony drug offense\" to incorporate the definition of \"felony\" in \u00a7 802(13), it easily could have written \u00a7 802(44) to state: \"The term `felony drug offense' means a <i>felony</i> that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year ....\" See <i>Roberson,</i> 459 F.3d, at 52. Congress has often used that drafting technique\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> repeating a discretely defined word\u0097when it intends to incorporate the definition of a particular word into the definition of a compound expression. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1672(a)-(b) (defining \"earnings\" and then defining \"disposable earnings\" as \"that part of the earnings\" meeting certain criteria); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(c)(3)-(4) (defining \"transaction\" and then defining \"financial transaction\" as \"a transaction which\" meets other criteria); \u00a7 1961(1), (5) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (defining \"racketeering activity\" and then defining \"pattern of racketeering activity\" to require \"at least two acts of racketeering activity\").<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Fourth, our reading avoids anomalies that would arise if both 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(13) and \u00a7 802(44) governed application of the sentencing enhancement in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Notably, \u00a7 802(44) includes foreign offenses punishable by more than one year, while \u00a7 802(13) includes only federal and state offenses. Incorporation of \u00a7 802(13) into \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) would exclude enhancement based on a foreign offense, notwithstanding the express inclusion of foreign offenses in \u00a7 802(44)'s definition of \"felony drug offense.\" Furthermore, some States and many foreign jurisdictions do not label offenses as felonies or misdemeanors. See N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:1-4 (West 2005); Me. Rev.Stat. Ann., Tit. 17-A, \u00a7 1252 (Supp. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1579</span> 2007); Brief for United States 35. Burgess' compound definition of \"felony drug offense\" leaves unanswered the appropriate classification of drug convictions in those jurisdictions. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563797\"><a href=\"/opinion/563797/united-states-v-stephen-a-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 70 (C.A.2 1991) (relying on New Jersey common law to determine that the State classifies offenses punishable by more than one year as felonies). No such uncertainty arises under the precise definition Congress provided in \u00a7 802(44).</p>\n<p>Finally, reading \u00a7 802(44) as the exclusive definition of \"felony drug offense\" hardly renders \u00a7 802(13) extraneous. Section 802(13) serves to define \"felony\" for many CSA provisions using that unadorned term. See, <i>e.g.,</i> \u00a7\u00a7 824(a)(2) (revocation of license to manufacture controlled substances upon conviction of a felony), 843(b) (use of a communication facility to commit a felony), 843(d)(1)-(2) (sentencing enhancements), 843(e) (prohibition on engaging in transactions involving listed chemicals upon conviction of a felony involving those chemicals), 848(c)(1) (definition of \"continuing criminal enterprise\"), 848(e)(1)(B) (mandatory minimum term for killing a law enforcement officer to avoid prosecution for a felony), 853(d) (rebuttable presumption that property acquired during commission of certain felonies is subject to criminal forfeiture), 878(a)(3) (authority to make warrantless arrest where there is probable cause to believe a felony has been committed).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The drafting history of the CSA reinforces our reading of \u00a7 802(44) as the exclusive definition of \"felony drug offense.\" In 1988, Congress first used the term \"felony drug offense\" to describe the type of prior conviction that would trigger a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). See National Narcotics Leadership Act, Pub.L. 100-690, \u00a7 6452(a), 102 Stat. 4371. The 1988 definition of the term was placed within \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) itself; the definition covered \"an offense that is a felony under any ... Federal law... or ... any law of a State or a foreign country\" prohibiting or restricting conduct relating to certain types of drugs. \u00a7 6452(a)(2), <i>ibid.</i><sup>[4]</sup> But in 1994, Congress amended the definition, replacing \"an offense that is a <i>felony</i> under ... any law of a State,\" <i>ibid.</i> (emphasis added), with \"an offense that is <i>punishable by imprisonment for more than one year</i> under any law ... of a State,\" Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Pub.L. 103-322, \u00a7 90105(c)-(d), 108 Stat.1988 (emphasis added). In lieu of incorporation within \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), the new definition was placed in a discrete \u00a7 802 definition section. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>This alteration lends considerable support to our reading of the statute. Before 1994, the definition of \"felony drug offense\" depended on the vagaries of state-law classifications of offenses as felonies or misdemeanors. The 1994 amendments replaced that definition with a uniform federal standard based on the authorized length of imprisonment. By recognizing \u00a7 802(44) as the exclusive definition of \"felony drug offense,\" our reading serves an evident purpose of the 1994 revision: to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1580</span> bring a measure of uniformity to the application of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) by eliminating disparities based on divergent state classifications of offenses.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Burgess reads the 1994 alteration as merely adding a length-of-imprisonment requirement to a definition that already required\u0097and, he contends, continues to require\u0097designation of an offense as a felony by the punishing jurisdiction. That view, however, is difficult to square with Congress' deletion of the word \"felony\" and substitution of the phrase \"punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\"</p>\n<p>If Burgess were correct, moreover, the sole effect of the 1994 change would have been to exclude from the compass of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) the few drug offenses classified as felonies under the law of the punishing jurisdiction but subject to a sentence of one year or less. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-8.<sup>[5]</sup> See also Brief for Petitioner 15 (purpose of 1994 alteration was to eliminate enhancement for \"truly minor offenses\" nonetheless classified as felonies). Burgess concedes that under his reading of the statute \"the language that Congress added [in 1994] has very little practical effect,\" but defends his interpretation on the ground that Congress labeled the changes \"conforming amendments.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. See also 108 Stat. 1987; Brief for Petitioner 12.</p>\n<p>Burgess places more weight on the \"Conforming Amendments\" caption than it can bear. Congress did not disavow any intent to make substantive changes; rather, the amendments were \"conforming\" because they harmonized sentencing provisions in the CSA and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, 84 Stat. 1285, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 951 <i>et seq.</i> Treating the amendments as nonsubstantive would be inconsistent with their text, not to mention Burgess' own view that \u00a7 802(44) added a new length-of-imprisonment requirement to the definition of \"felony drug offense.\"</p>\n<p>In sum, the 1994 alteration replaced a patchwork of state and foreign classifications with a uniform federal standard based on the authorized term of imprisonment. Burgess' argument that Congress added something\u0097the definition now in \u00a7 802(44)\u0097but subtracted nothing encounters formidable impediments: the text and history of the statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Burgess urges us to apply the rule of lenity in determining whether the term \"felony drug offense\" incorporates \u00a7 802(13)'s definition of \"felony.\" \"[T]he touchstone of the rule of lenity is statutory ambiguity.\" <i>Bifulco v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110305\"><a href=\"/opinion/110305/bifulco-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"The rule comes into operation at the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed,\" <i>Callanan v.

Here, Congress expressly defined the term \"felony drug offense.\" The definition is coherent, complete, and by all signs exclusive. Accordingly, there is no ambiguity for the rule of lenity to resolve.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1581</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although Title 21 of the United States Code has not been enacted as positive law, we refer to it rather than the underlying provisions of the Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <i>et seq.,</i> for the sake of simplicity. The relevant provisions of Title 21 have not changed from the time of Burgess' offense, and all citations are to the 2000 edition through Supplement V.</p>\n<p>[2]  Burgess received a one-year suspended sentence for his South Carolina conviction, but does not dispute that the offense was \"<i>punishable</i> by imprisonment for more than one year.\" \u00a7 802(44) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[3]  Burgess offers four examples of defined words nested within defined phrases where, he asserts, the definition of the word is embraced within the phrase, although the word is not repeated in the definition of the phrase. See Reply Brief 11-12; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 11-12. In all but one of these examples, however, the definition of the phrase is introduced by the word \"includes.\" See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(4), (6), (7); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2266(3)-(4). \"[T]he word `includes' is usually a term of enlargement, and not of limitation.\" 2A Singer \u00a7 47:7, p. 305 (some internal quotation marks omitted). Thus \"[a] term whose statutory definition declares what it `includes' is more susceptible to extension of meaning... than where\"\u0097as in \u00a7 802(44)\u0097\"the definition declares what a term `means.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> See also <i>Groman v. Commissioner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102856\"><a href=\"/opinion/102856/groman-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 86, 58 S.Ct. 108, 82 L.Ed. 63 (1937) (\"[W]hen an exclusive definition is intended the word `means' is employed, ... whereas here the word used is `includes.'\").\n</p>\n<p>Burgess' fourth example is also inapposite. The definition of \"debtor's principal residence\" in the Bankruptcy Code, he notes, does not repeat the word \"debtor,\" itself a discretely defined term. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(13), (13A) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Section 101(13A) states: \"The term `debtor's principal residence'\u0097(A) means a residential structure, including incidental property, without regard to whether that structure is attached to real property; and (B) includes an individual condominium or cooperative unit, a mobile or manufactured home, or trailer.\" That definition, unlike 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44), is incomplete on its face because nothing in the definition of \"debtor's principal residence\" elucidates the word \"debtor's.\" Given that void and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(13A)'s placement in the Bankruptcy Code, it is reasonable to assume that Congress wanted courts to read the phrase \"debtor's principal residence\" in light of the separate definition of \"debtor.\" Indeed, a contrary reading would yield the absurd result that <i>every</i> residential structure is a \"debtor's principal residence.\"</p>\n<p>At most, therefore, Burgess' fourth example illustrates the importance of considering context in applying canons of statutory construction. There may well be other examples lurking in the United States Code of nested terms that draw their meaning from two different statutory provisions without repeating one term in the definition of the other. But \"felony drug offense\" is not among them.</p>\n<p>[4]  The full definition stated:\n</p>\n<p>\"For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `felony drug offense' means an offense that is a felony under any provision of this title or any other Federal law that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances or a felony under any law of a State or a foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances.\" National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988, Pub.L. 100-690, \u00a7 6452(a)(2), 102 Stat. 4371.</p>\n<p>[5]  The examples provided by Burgess of such atypical categorization, Brief for Petitioner 22, all carry maximum sentences of exactly one year.
