Garone, Counsel of Record, Michael A. Cohen, Jay T. Waldron, Sara Kobak Schwabe, Williamson &amp; Wyatt, P.C., Portland, OR, for Petitioner.</p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U.S.C. § 1 <i>et seq.,</i> provides for expedited judicial review to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitration awards. §§ 9-11 (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The question here is whether statutory grounds for prompt vacatur and modification may be supplemented by contract. We hold that the statutory grounds are exclusive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>This case began as a lease dispute between landlord, petitioner Hall Street Associates, L.L.C., and tenant, respondent Mattel, Inc. The property was used for many years as a manufacturing site, and the leases provided that the tenant would indemnify the landlord for any costs resulting from the failure of the tenant or its predecessor lessees to follow environmental laws while using the premises. App. 88-89.</p>\n<p>Tests of the property's well water in 1998 showed high levels of trichloroethylene (TCE), the apparent residue of manufacturing discharges by Mattel's predecessors between 1951 and 1980. After the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) discovered even more pollutants, Mattel stopped drawing from the well and, along with one of its predecessors, signed a consent order with the DEQ providing for cleanup of the site.</p>\n<p>After Mattel gave notice of intent to terminate the lease in 2001, Hall Street filed this suit, contesting Mattel's right to vacate on the date it gave, and claiming that the lease obliged Mattel to indemnify Hall Street for costs of cleaning up the TCE, among other things. Following a bench trial before the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, Mattel won on the termination issue, and after an unsuccessful try at mediating the indemnification claim, the parties proposed to submit to arbitration. The District Court was amenable, and the parties drew up an arbitration agreement, which the court approved and entered as an order. One paragraph of the agreement provided that</p>\n<blockquote>\"[t]he United States District Court for the District of Oregon may enter judgment upon any award, either by confirming the award or by vacating, modifying or correcting the award. The Court shall vacate, modify or correct any award: (i) where the arbitrator's findings of facts are not supported by substantial evidence, or (ii) where the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1401</span> arbitrator's conclusions of law are erroneous.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a.</blockquote>\n<p>Arbitration took place, and the arbitrator decided for Mattel. In particular, he held that no indemnification was due, because the lease obligation to follow all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws did not require compliance with the testing requirements of the Oregon Drinking Water Quality Act (Oregon Act); that Act the arbitrator characterized as dealing with human health as distinct from environmental contamination.</p>\n<p>Hall Street then filed a District Court Motion for Order Vacating, Modifying And/Or Correcting the arbitration decision, App. 4, on the ground that failing to treat the Oregon Act as an applicable environmental law under the terms of the lease was legal error. The District Court agreed, vacated the award, and remanded for further consideration by the arbitrator. The court expressly invoked the standard of review chosen by the parties in the arbitration agreement, which included review for legal error, and cited <i>LaPine Technology Corp. v. Kyocera Corp.,</i> 130 F.3d 884, 889 (C.A.9 1997), for the proposition that the FAA leaves the parties \"free. . . to draft a contract that sets rules for arbitration and dictates an alternative standard of review.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.</p>\n<p>On remand, the arbitrator followed the District Court's ruling that the Oregon Act was an applicable environmental law and amended the decision to favor Hall Street. This time, each party sought modification, and again the District Court applied the parties' stipulated standard of review for legal error, correcting the arbitrator's calculation of interest but otherwise upholding the award. Each party then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where Mattel switched horses and contended that the Ninth Circuit's recent en banc action overruling <i>LaPine</i> in <i>Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade Servs., Inc.,</i> 341 F.3d 987, 1000 (2003), left the arbitration agreement's provision for judicial review of legal error unenforceable. Hall Street countered that <i>Kyocera</i> (the later one) was distinguishable, and that the agreement's judicial review provision was not severable from the submission to arbitration.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit reversed in favor of Mattel in holding that, \"[u]nder <i>Kyocera</i> the terms of the arbitration agreement controlling the mode of judicial review are unenforceable and severable.\" 113 Fed. Appx. 272, 272-273 (2004). The Circuit instructed the District Court on remand to</p>\n<blockquote>\"return to the application to confirm the original arbitration award (not the subsequent award revised after reversal), and . . . confirm that award, unless . . . the award should be vacated on the grounds allowable under 9 U.S.C. § 10, or modified or corrected under the grounds allowable under 9 U.S.C. § 11.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 273.</blockquote>\n<p>After the District Court again held for Hall Street and the Ninth Circuit again reversed,<sup>[1]</sup> we granted certiorari to decide whether the grounds for vacatur and modification provided by §§ 10 and 11 of the FAA are exclusive. 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2875, 167 L.Ed.2d 1151 (2007). We agree with the Ninth Circuit that they are, but vacate and remand for consideration of independent issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1402</span> II</h2>\n<p>Congress enacted the FAA to replace judicial indisposition to arbitration with a \"national policy favoring [it] and plac[ing] arbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts.\" <i>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna,</i> 546 U.S. 440, 443, 126 S.Ct. 1204, 163 L.Ed.2d 1038 (2006). As for jurisdiction over controversies touching arbitration, the Act does nothing, being \"something of an anomaly in the field of federal-court jurisdiction\" in bestowing no federal jurisdiction but rather requiring an independent jurisdictional basis. <i>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,</i> 460 U.S. 1, 25, n. 32, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983); see, <i>e.g.,</i> 9 U.S.C. § 4 (providing for action by a federal district court \"which, save for such [arbitration] agreement, would have jurisdiction under title 28\").<sup>[2]</sup> But in cases falling within a court's jurisdiction, the Act makes contracts to arbitrate \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,\" so long as their subject involves \"commerce.\" § 2. And this is so whether an agreement has a broad reach or goes just to one dispute, and whether enforcement be sought in state court or federal. See <i>ibid.; </i><i>Southland Corp. v. Keating,</i> 465 U.S. 1, 15-16, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984).</p>\n<p>The Act also supplies mechanisms for enforcing arbitration awards: a judicial decree confirming an award, an order vacating it, or an order modifying or correcting it. §§ 9-11. An application for any of these orders will get streamlined treatment as a motion, obviating the separate contract action that would usually be necessary to enforce or tinker with an arbitral award in court.<sup>[3]</sup> § 6. Under the terms of § 9, a court \"must\" confirm an arbitration award \"unless\" it is vacated, modified, or corrected \"as prescribed\" in §§ 10 and 11. Section 10 lists grounds for vacating an award, while § 11 names those for modifying or correcting one.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1403</span> The Courts of Appeals have split over the exclusiveness of these statutory grounds when parties take the FAA shortcut to confirm, vacate, or modify an award, with some saying the recitations are exclusive, and others regarding them as mere threshold provisions open to expansion by agreement.<sup>[5]</sup> As mentioned already, when this litigation started, the Ninth Circuit was on the threshold side of the split, see <i>LaPine,</i> 130 F.3d, at 889, from which it later departed en banc in favor of the exclusivity view, see <i>Kyocera,</i> 341 F.3d, at 1000, which it followed in this case, see 113 Fed.Appx., at 273. We now hold that §§ 10 and 11 respectively provide the FAA's exclusive grounds for expedited vacatur and modification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Hall Street makes two main efforts to show that the grounds set out for vacating or modifying an award are not exclusive, taking the position, first, that expandable judicial review authority has been accepted as the law since <i>Wilko v. Swan,</i> 346 U.S. 427, 74 S.Ct. 182, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953). This, however, was not what <i>Wilko</i> decided, which was that § 14 of the Securities Act of 1933 voided any agreement to arbitrate claims of violations of that Act, see <i>id.,</i> at 437-438, 74 S.Ct. 182, a holding since overruled by <i>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,</i> 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989). Although it is true that the Court's discussion includes some language arguably favoring Hall Street's position, arguable is as far as it goes.</p>\n<p>The <i>Wilko</i> Court was explaining that arbitration would undercut the Securities Act's buyer protections when it remarked (citing FAA § 10) that \"[p]ower to vacate an [arbitration] award is limited,\" 346 U.S., at 436, 74 S.Ct. 182, and went on to say that \"the interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard [of the law] are not subject, in the federal courts, to judicial review for error in interpretation,\" <i>id.,</i> at 436-437, 74 S.Ct. 182. Hall Street reads this statement as recognizing \"manifest disregard of the law\" as a further ground for vacatur on top of those listed in § 10, and some Circuits have read it the same way. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>McCarthy v. Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.,</i> 463 F.3d 87, 91 (CA1 2006); <i>Hoeft v. MVL Group, Inc.,</i> 343 F.3d 57, 64 (CA2 2003); <i>Prestige Ford v. Ford Dealer Computer Servs., Inc.,</i> 324 F.3d 391, 395-396 (C.A.5 2003); <i>Scott v. Prudential Securities, Inc.,</i> 141 F.3d 1007, 1017 (C.A.11 1998). Hall Street sees this supposed addition to § 10 as the camel's nose: if judges can add grounds to vacate (or modify), so can contracting parties.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1404</span> But this is too much for <i>Wilko</i> to bear. Quite apart from its leap from a supposed judicial expansion by interpretation to a private expansion by contract, Hall Street overlooks the fact that the statement it relies on expressly rejects just what Hall Street asks for here, general review for an arbitrator's legal errors. Then there is the vagueness of <i>Wilko</i>'s phrasing. Maybe the term \"manifest disregard\" was meant to name a new ground for review, but maybe it merely referred to the § 10 grounds collectively, rather than adding to them. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,</i> 473 U.S. 614, 656, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"Arbitration awards are only reviewable for manifest disregard of the law, 9 U.S.C. §§ 10, 207\"); <i>I/S Stavborg v. National Metal Converters, Inc.,</i> 500 F.2d 424, 431 (C.A.2 1974). Or, as some courts have thought, \"manifest disregard\" may have been shorthand for § 10(a)(3) or § 10(a)(4), the subsections authorizing vacatur when the arbitrators were \"guilty of misconduct\" or \"exceeded their powers.\" See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Kyocera, supra,</i> at 997. We, when speaking as a Court, have merely taken the <i>Wilko</i> language as we found it, without embellishment, see <i>First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan,</i> 514 U.S. 938, 942, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995), and now that its meaning is implicated, we see no reason to accord it the significance that Hall Street urges.</p>\n<p>Second, Hall Street says that the agreement to review for legal error ought to prevail simply because arbitration is a creature of contract, and the FAA is \"motivated, first and foremost, by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into which parties ha[ve] entered.\" <i>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd,</i> 470 U.S. 213, 220, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985). But, again, we think the argument comes up short. Hall Street is certainly right that the FAA lets parties tailor some, even many features of arbitration by contract, including the way arbitrators are chosen, what their qualifications should be, which issues are arbitrable, along with procedure and choice of substantive law. But to rest this case on the general policy of treating arbitration agreements as enforceable as such would be to beg the question, which is whether the FAA has textual features at odds with enforcing a contract to expand judicial review following the arbitration.</p>\n<p>To that particular question we think the answer is yes, that the text compels a reading of the §§10 and 11 categories as exclusive. To begin with, even if we assumed §§ 10 and 11 could be supplemented to some extent, it would stretch basic interpretive principles to expand the stated grounds to the point of evidentiary and legal review generally. Sections 10 and 11, after all, address egregious departures from the parties' agreed-upon arbitration: \"corruption,\" \"fraud,\" \"evident partiality,\" \"misconduct,\" \"misbehavior,\" \"exceed[ing] . . . powers,\" \"evident material miscalculation,\" \"evident material mistake,\" \"award[s] upon a matter not submitted;\" the only ground with any softer focus is \"imperfect[ions],\" and a court may correct those only if they go to \"[a] matter of form not affecting the merits.\" Given this emphasis on extreme arbitral conduct, the old rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> has an implicit lesson to teach here. Under that rule, when a statute sets out a series of specific items ending with a general term, that general term is confined to covering subjects comparable to the specifics it follows. Since a general term included in the text is normally so limited, then surely a statute with no textual hook for expansion cannot authorize contracting parties to supplement review for specific instances of outrageous conduct with review for just <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1405</span> any legal error. \"Fraud\" and a mistake of law are not cut from the same cloth.</p>\n<p>That aside, expanding the detailed categories would rub too much against the grain of the § 9 language, where provision for judicial confirmation carries no hint of flexibility. On application for an order confirming the arbitration award, the court \"must grant\" the order \"unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of this title.\" There is nothing malleable about \"must grant,\" which unequivocally tells courts to grant confirmation in all cases, except when one of the \"prescribed\" exceptions applies. This does not sound remotely like a provision meant to tell a court what to do just in case the parties say nothing else.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>In fact, anyone who thinks Congress might have understood § 9 as a default provision should turn back to § 5 for an example of what Congress thought a default provision would look like:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[i]f in the agreement provision be made for a method of naming or appointing an arbitrator . . . such method shall be followed; but if no method be provided therein, or if a method be provided and any party thereto shall fail to avail himself of such method, . . . then upon the application of either party to the controversy the court shall designate and appoint an arbitrator. . . . .\"</blockquote>\n<p>\"[I]f no method be provided\" is a far cry from \"must grant . . . unless\" in § 9.</p>\n<p>Instead of fighting the text, it makes more sense to see the three provisions, §§ 9-11, as substantiating a national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitration's essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway. Any other reading opens the door to the full-bore legal and evidentiary appeals that can \"rende[r] informal arbitration merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time-consuming judicial review process,\" <i>Kyocera,</i> 341 F.3d, at 998; cf. <i>Ethyl Corp. v. United Steelworkers of America,</i> 768 F.2d 180, 184 (C.A.7 1985), and bring arbitration theory to grief in post-arbitration process.</p>\n<p>Nor is <i>Dean Witter,</i> 470 U.S. 213, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158, to the contrary, as Hall Street claims it to be. <i>Dean Witter</i> held that state-law claims subject to an agreement to arbitrate could not be remitted to a district court considering a related, nonarbitrable federal claim; the state-law claims were to go to arbitration immediately. <i>Id.,</i> at 217, 105 S.Ct. 1238. Despite the opinion's language \"reject[ing] the suggestion that the overriding goal of the [FAA] was to promote the expeditious <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1406</span> resolution of claims,\" <i>id.,</i> at 219, 105 S.Ct. 1238, the holding mandated immediate enforcement of an arbitration agreement; the Court was merely trying to explain that the inefficiency and difficulty of conducting simultaneous arbitration and federal-court litigation was not a good enough reason to defer the arbitration, see <i>id.,</i> at 217, 105 S.Ct. 1238.</p>\n<p>When all these arguments based on prior legal authority are done with, Hall Street and Mattel remain at odds over what happens next. Hall Street and its <i>amici</i> say parties will flee from arbitration if expanded review is not open to them. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Petitioner 39; Brief for New England Legal Foundation et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 15. One of Mattel's <i>amici</i> foresees flight from the courts if it is. See Brief for U.S. Council for Int'l Business as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 29-30. We do not know who, if anyone, is right, and so cannot say whether the exclusivity reading of the statute is more of a threat to the popularity of arbitrators or to that of courts. But whatever the consequences of our holding, the statutory text gives us no business to expand the statutory grounds.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>In holding that §§ 10 and 11 provide exclusive regimes for the review provided by the statute, we do not purport to say that they exclude more searching review based on authority outside the statute as well. The FAA is not the only way into court for parties wanting review of arbitration awards: they may contemplate enforcement under state statutory or common law, for example, where judicial review of different scope is arguable. But here we speak only to the scope of the expeditious judicial review under §§ 9, 10, and 11, deciding nothing about other possible avenues for judicial enforcement of arbitration awards.</p>\n<p>Although one such avenue is now claimed to be revealed in the procedural <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1407</span> history of this case, no claim to it was presented when the case arrived on our doorstep, and no reason then appeared to us for treating this as anything but an FAA case. There was never any question about meeting the FAA § 2 requirement that the leases from which the dispute arose be contracts \"involving commerce.\" 9 U.S.C. § 2; see <i>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,</i> 513 U.S. 265, 277, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995) (§ 2 \"exercise[s] Congress' commerce power to the full\"). Nor is there any doubt now that the parties at least had the FAA in mind at the outset; the arbitration agreement even incorporates FAA § 7, empowering arbitrators to compel attendance of witnesses. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a.</p>\n<p>While it is true that the agreement does not expressly invoke FAA § 9, § 10, or § 11, and none of the various motions to vacate or modify the award expressly said that the parties were relying on the FAA, the District Court apparently thought it was applying the FAA when it alluded to the Act in quoting <i>LaPine,</i> 130 F.3d, at 889, for the then-unexceptional proposition that \"`[f]ederal courts can expand their review of an arbitration award beyond the FAA's grounds, when . . . the parties have so agreed.'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. And the Ninth Circuit, for its part, seemed to take it as a given that the District Court's direct and prompt examination of the award depended on the FAA; it found the expanded-review provision unenforceable under <i>Kyocera</i> and remanded for confirmation of the original award \"unless the district court determines that the award should be vacated on the grounds allowable under 9 U.S.C. § 10, or modified or corrected under the grounds allowable under 9 U.S.C. § 11.\" 113 Fed.Appx., at 273. In the petition for certiorari and the principal briefing before us, the parties acted on the same premise. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Pet. for Cert. 27 (\"This Court should accept review to resolve this important issue of statutory construction under the FAA\"); Brief for Petitioner 16 (\"Because arbitration provisions providing for judicial review of arbitration awards for legal error are consistent with the goals and policies of the FAA and employ a standard of review which district courts regularly apply in a variety of contexts, those provisions are entitled to enforcement under the FAA\").</p>\n<p>One unusual feature, however, prompted some of us to question whether the case should be approached another way. The arbitration agreement was entered into in the course of district-court litigation, was submitted to the District Court as a request to deviate from the standard sequence of trial procedure, and was adopted by the District Court as an order. See App. 46-47; App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a-8a. Hence a question raised by this Court at oral argument: should the agreement be treated as an exercise of the District Court's authority to manage its cases under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 16? See, <i>e.g.,</i> Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12. Supplemental briefing at the Court's behest joined issue on the question, and it appears that Hall Street suggested something along these lines in the Court of Appeals, which did not address the suggestion.</p>\n<p>We are, however, in no position to address the question now, beyond noting the claim of relevant case management authority independent of the FAA. The parties' supplemental arguments on the subject in this Court implicate issues of waiver and the relation of the FAA both to Rule 16 and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998, 28 U.S.C. § 651 <i>et seq.,</i> none of which has been considered previously in this litigation, or could be well addressed for the first time here. We express no opinion on these matters beyond leaving them open for Hall Street to press on remand. If the Court of Appeals finds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1408</span> they are open, the court may consider whether the District Court's authority to manage litigation independently warranted that court's order on the mode of resolving the indemnification issues remaining in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Although we agree with the Ninth Circuit that the FAA confines its expedited judicial review to the grounds listed in 9 U.S.C. §§ 10 and 11, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice KENNEDY joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>May parties to an ongoing lawsuit agree to submit their dispute to arbitration subject to the caveat that the trial judge should refuse to enforce an award that rests on an erroneous conclusion of law? Prior to Congress' enactment of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) in 1925, the answer to that question would surely have been \"Yes.\"<sup>[1]</sup> Today, however, the Court holds that the FAA does not merely authorize the vacation or enforcement of awards on specified grounds, but also forbids enforcement of perfectly reasonable judicial review provisions in arbitration agreements fairly negotiated by the parties and approved by the district court. Because this result conflicts with the primary purpose of the FAA and ignores the historical context in which the Act was passed, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Prior to the passage of the FAA, American courts were generally hostile to arbitration. They refused, with rare exceptions, to order specific enforcement of executory agreements to arbitrate.<sup>[2]</sup> Section 2 of the FAA responded to this hostility by making written arbitration agreements \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.\" 9 U.S.C. § 2. This section, which is the centerpiece of the FAA, reflects Congress' main goal in passing the legislation: \"to abrogate the general common-law rule against specific enforcement of arbitration agreements,\" <i>Southland Corp. v. Keating,</i> 465 U.S. 1, 18, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and to \"ensur[e] that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms,\" <i>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.,</i> 489 U.S. 468, 478, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989). Given this settled understanding of the core purpose of the FAA, the interests favoring enforceability of parties' arbitration agreements are stronger today than before the FAA was enacted. As such, there is moreand certainly not lessreason to give effect to parties' fairly negotiated decisions to provide for judicial review of arbitration awards for errors of law.</p>\n<p>Petitioner filed this rather complex action in an Oregon state court. Based on the diverse citizenship of the parties, respondent removed the case to federal court. More than three years later, and after some issues had been resolved, the parties sought and obtained the District <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1409</span> Court's approval of their agreement to arbitrate the remaining issues subject to <i>de novo</i> judicial review. They neither requested, nor suggested that the FAA authorized, any \"expedited\" disposition of their case. Because the arbitrator made a rather glaring error of law, the judge refused to affirm his award until after that error was corrected. The Ninth Circuit reversed.</p>\n<p>This Court now agrees with the Ninth Circuit's (most recent) interpretation of the FAA as setting forth the exclusive grounds for modification or vacation of an arbitration award under the statute. As I read the Court's opinion, it identifies two possible reasons for reaching this result: (1) a supposed <i>quid pro quo</i> bargain between Congress and litigants that conditions expedited federal enforcement of arbitration awards on acceptance of a statutory limit on the scope of judicial review of such awards; and (2) an assumption that Congress intended to include the words \"and no other\" in the grounds specified in §§ 10 and 11 for the vacatur and modification of awards. Neither reason is persuasive.</p>\n<p>While § 9 of the FAA imposes a 1-year limit on the time in which any party to an arbitration may apply for confirmation of an award, the statute does not require that the application be given expedited treatment. Of course, the premise of the entire statute is an assumption that the arbitration process may be more expeditious and less costly than ordinary litigation, but that is a reason for interpreting the statute liberally to favor the parties' use of arbitration. An unnecessary refusal to enforce a perfectly reasonable category of arbitration agreements defeats the primary purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p>That purpose also provides a sufficient response to the Court's reliance on statutory text. It is true that a wooden application of \"the old rule of <i>ejusdem generis,</i>\" <i>ante,</i> at 1404, might support an inference that the categories listed in §§ 10 and 11 are exclusive, but the literal text does not compel that readinga reading that is flatly inconsistent with the overriding interest in effectuating the clearly expressed intent of the contracting parties. A listing of grounds that must always be available to contracting parties simply does not speak to the question whether they may agree to additional grounds for judicial review.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in light of the historical context and the broader purpose of the FAA, §§ 10 and 11 are best understood as a shield meant to protect parties from hostile courts, not a sword with which to cut down parties' \"valid, irrevocable and enforceable\" agreements to arbitrate their disputes subject to judicial review for errors of law.<sup>[3]</sup> § 2.</p>\n<p>Even if I thought the narrow issue presented in this case were as debatable as the conflict among the courts of appeals suggests, I would rely on a presumption of overriding importance to resolve the debate and rule in favor of petitioner's position that the FAA permits the statutory grounds for vacatur and modification of an award to be supplemented by contract. A decision \"<i>not to regulate</i>\" the terms of an agreement that does not even arguably offend any public policy whatsoever, \"is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1410</span> adequately justified by a presumption in favor of freedom.\" <i>FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc.,</i> 508 U.S. 307, 320, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, while I agree that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be set aside, and that there may be additional avenues available for judicial enforcement of parties' fairly negotiated review provisions, see, <i>ante,</i> at 1406-1408, I respectfully dissent from the Court's interpretation of the FAA, and would direct the Court of Appeals to affirm the judgment of the District Court enforcing the arbitrator's final award.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The question presented in this case is whether \"the Federal Arbitration Act . . . <i>precludes</i> a federal court from enforcing\" an arbitration agreement that gives the court the power to set aside an arbitration award that embodies an arbitrator's mistake about the law. Pet. for Cert. i. Like the majority and Justice STEVENS, and primarily for the reasons they set forth, I believe that the Act does not <i>preclude</i> enforcement of such an agreement. See <i>ante,</i> at 1406-1407 (opinion of the Court) (The Act \"is not the only way into court for parties wanting review of arbitration awards\"); <i>ante,</i> at 1409-1410 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (The Act is a \"shield meant to protect parties from hostile courts, not a sword with which to cut down parties' `valid, irrevocable and enforceable' agreements to arbitrate their disputes subject to judicial review for errors of law\").</p>\n<p>At the same time, I see no need to send the case back for further judicial decisionmaking. The agreement here was entered into with the consent of the parties and the approval of the District Court. Aside from the Federal Arbitration Act itself, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <i>et seq.,</i> respondent below pointed to no statute, rule, or other relevant public policy that the agreement might violate. The Court has now rejected its argument that the agreement violates the Act, and I would simply remand the case with instructions that the Court of Appeals affirm the District Court's judgment enforcing the arbitrator's final award.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Justice SCALIA joins all but footnote 7 of this opinion.</p>\n<p>[1]  On remand, the District Court vacated the arbitration award, because it supposedly rested on an implausible interpretation of the lease and thus exceeded the arbitrator's powers, in violation of 9 U.S.C. § 10. Mattel appealed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that implausibility is not a valid ground for vacating or correcting an award under § 10 or § 11. 196 Fed.Appx. 476, 477-478 (2006).</p>\n<p>[2]  Because the FAA is not jurisdictional, there is no merit in the argument that enforcing the arbitration agreement's judicial review provision would create federal jurisdiction by private contract. The issue is entirely about the scope of judicial review permissible under the FAA.</p>\n<p>[3]  Unlike Justice STEVENS, see <i>post,</i> at 1408-1409 (dissenting opinion), we understand this expedited review to be what each of the parties understood it was seeking from time to time; neither party's pleadings were amended to raise an independent state-law contract claim or defense specific to the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>[4]  Title 9 U.S.C. § 10(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) provides:\n</p>\n<p>\"(a) In any of the following cases the United States court in and for the district wherein the award was made may make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration </p>\n<p>\"(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means;</p>\n<p>\"(2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them;</p>\n<p>\"(3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or</p>\n<p>\"(4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\"</p>\n<p>Title 9 U.S.C. § 11 (2000 ed.) provides:</p>\n<p>\"In either of the following cases the United States court in and for the district wherein the award was made may make an order modifying or correcting the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration</p>\n<p>\"(a) Where there was an evident material miscalculation of figures or an evident material mistake in the description of any person, thing, or property referred to in the award.</p>\n<p>\"(b) Where the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them, unless it is a matter not affecting the merits of the decision upon the matter submitted.</p>\n<p>\"(c) Where the award is imperfect in matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy.</p>\n<p>\"The order may modify and correct the award, so as to effect the intent thereof and promote justice between the parties.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  The Ninth and Tenth Circuits have held that parties may not contract for expanded judicial review. See <i>Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade Servs., Inc.,</i> 341 F.3d 987, 1000 (C.A.9 2003); <i>Bowen v. Amoco Pipeline Co.,</i> 254 F.3d 925, 936 (C.A.10 2001). The First, Third, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits, meanwhile, have held that parties may so contract. See <i>Puerto Rico Tel. Co. v. U.S. Phone Mfg. Corp.,</i> 427 F.3d 21, 31 (C.A.1 2005); <i>Jacada (Europe), Ltd. v. International Marketing Strategies, Inc.,</i> 401 F.3d 701, 710 (C.A.6 2005); <i>Roadway Package System, Inc. v. Kayser,</i> 257 F.3d 287, 288 (C.A.3 2001); <i>Gateway Technologies, Inc. v. MCI Telecommunications Corp.,</i> 64 F.3d 993, 997 (C.A.5 1995). The Fourth Circuit has taken the latter side of the split in an unpublished opinion, see <i>Syncor Int'l Corp. v. McLeland,</i> 120 F.3d 262 (1997), while the Eighth Circuit has expressed agreement with the former side in dicta, see <i>UHC Management Co. v. Computer Sciences Corp.,</i> 148 F.3d 992, 997-998 (1998).</p>\n<p>[6]  Hall Street claims that § 9 supports its position, because it allows a court to confirm an award only \"[i]f the parties in their agreement have agreed that a judgment of the court shall be entered upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration.\" Hall Street argues that this language \"expresses Congress's intent that a court must enforce the agreement of the parties as to whether, and under what circumstances, a judgment shall be entered.\" Reply Brief for Petitioner 5; see also Brief for Petitioner 22-24. It is a peculiar argument, converting agreement as a necessary condition for judicial enforcement into a sufficient condition for a court to bar enforcement. And the text is otherwise problematical for Hall Street: § 9 says that if the parties have agreed to judicial enforcement, the court \"must grant\" confirmation unless grounds for vacatur or modification exist under § 10 or § 11. The sentence nowhere predicates the court's judicial action on the parties' having agreed to specific standards; if anything, it suggests that, so long as the parties contemplated judicial enforcement, the court must undertake such enforcement under the statutory criteria. In any case, the arbitration agreement here did not specifically predicate entry of judgment on adherence to its judicial-review standard. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 15a. To the extent Hall Street argues otherwise, it contests not the meaning of the FAA but the Ninth Circuit's severability analysis, upon which it did not seek certiorari.</p>\n<p>[7]  The history of the FAA is consistent with our conclusion. The text of the FAA was based upon that of New York's arbitration statute. See S.Rep. No. 536, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1924) (\"The bill . . . follows the lines of the New York arbitration law enacted in 1920. . .\"). The New York Arbitration Law incorporated pre-existing provisions of the New York Code of Civil Procedure. See 1920 N.Y. Laws p. 806. Section 2373 of the code said that, upon application by a party for a confirmation order, \"the court must grant such an order, unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected, as prescribed by the next two sections.\" 2 N.Y. Ann.Code Civ. Proc. (Stover 6th ed.1902) (hereinafter Stover). The subsequent sections gave grounds for vacatur and modification or correction virtually identical to the 9 U.S.C. §§ 10 and 11 grounds. See 2 Stover §§ 2374, 2375.\n</p>\n<p>In a brief submitted to the House and Senate Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary, Julius Henry Cohen, one of the primary drafters of both the 1920 New York Act and the proposed FAA, said, \"The grounds for vacating, modifying, or correcting an award are limited. If the award [meets a condition of § 10], then and then only the award may be vacated. . . . If there was [an error under § 11], then and then only it may be modified or corrected . . . .\" Arbitration of Interstate Commercial Disputes, Joint Hearings before the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary on S. 1005 and H.R. 646, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 34 (1924). The House Report similarly recognized that an \"award may . . . be entered as a judgment, subject to attack by the other party for fraud and corruption and similar undue influence, or for palpable error in form.\" H.R.Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1924).</p>\n<p>In a contemporaneous campaign for the promulgation of a uniform state arbitration law, Cohen contrasted the New York Act with the Illinois Arbitration and Awards Act of 1917, which required an arbitrator, at the request of either party, to submit any question of law arising during arbitration to judicial determination. See Handbook of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and Proceedings 97-98 (1924); 1917 Ill. Laws p. 203.</p>\n<p>[1]  See <i>Klein v. Catara,</i> 14 F. Cas. 732, 735 (C.C.D.Mass.1814) (\"If the parties wish to reserve the law for the decision of the court, they may stipulate to that effect in the submission; they may restrain or enlarge its operation as they please\") (Story, J.).</p>\n<p>[2]  See <i>Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co.,</i> 264 U.S. 109, 120-122, 44 S.Ct. 274, 68 L.Ed. 582 (1924); <i>The Atlanten,</i> 252 U.S. 313, 315-316, 40 S.Ct. 332, 64 L.Ed. 586 (1920). Although agreements to arbitrate were not specifically enforceable, courts did award nominal damages for the breach of such contracts.</p>\n<p>[3]  In the years before the passage of the FAA, arbitration awards were subject to thorough and broad judicial review. See Cohen &amp; Dayton, The New Federal Arbitration Law, 12 Va. L.Rev. 265, 270-271 (1926); Cullinan, Contracting for an Expanded Scope of Judicial Review in Arbitration Agreements, 51 Vand. L.Rev. 395, 409 (1998). In §§ 10 and 11 of the FAA, Congress significantly limited the grounds for judicial vacatur or modification of such awards in order to protect arbitration awards from hostile and meddlesome courts.</p>\n\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b>128 S.Ct. 1396 (2008)</b></center>\n<center><h1>HALL STREET ASSOCIATES, L.L.C., Petitioner,<br>\nv.<br>\nMATTEL, INC.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 06-989.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued November 7, 2007.</center>\n<center>Decided March 25, 2008.</center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1399</span> Carter G.

Garone, Counsel of Record, Michael A. Cohen, Jay T. Waldron, Sara Kobak Schwabe, Williamson &amp; Wyatt, P.C., Portland, OR, for Petitioner.</p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U.S.C. § 1 <i>et seq.,</i> provides for expedited judicial review to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitration awards. §§ 9-11 (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The question here is whether statutory grounds for prompt vacatur and modification may be supplemented by contract. We hold that the statutory grounds are exclusive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>This case began as a lease dispute between landlord, petitioner Hall Street Associates, L.L.C., and tenant, respondent Mattel, Inc. The property was used for many years as a manufacturing site, and the leases provided that the tenant would indemnify the landlord for any costs resulting from the failure of the tenant or its predecessor lessees to follow environmental laws while using the premises. App. 88-89.</p>\n<p>Tests of the property's well water in 1998 showed high levels of trichloroethylene (TCE), the apparent residue of manufacturing discharges by Mattel's predecessors between 1951 and 1980. After the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) discovered even more pollutants, Mattel stopped drawing from the well and, along with one of its predecessors, signed a consent order with the DEQ providing for cleanup of the site.</p>\n<p>After Mattel gave notice of intent to terminate the lease in 2001, Hall Street filed this suit, contesting Mattel's right to vacate on the date it gave, and claiming that the lease obliged Mattel to indemnify Hall Street for costs of cleaning up the TCE, among other things. Following a bench trial before the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, Mattel won on the termination issue, and after an unsuccessful try at mediating the indemnification claim, the parties proposed to submit to arbitration. The District Court was amenable, and the parties drew up an arbitration agreement, which the court approved and entered as an order. One paragraph of the agreement provided that</p>\n<blockquote>\"[t]he United States District Court for the District of Oregon may enter judgment upon any award, either by confirming the award or by vacating, modifying or correcting the award. The Court shall vacate, modify or correct any award: (i) where the arbitrator's findings of facts are not supported by substantial evidence, or (ii) where the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1401</span> arbitrator's conclusions of law are erroneous.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a.</blockquote>\n<p>Arbitration took place, and the arbitrator decided for Mattel. In particular, he held that no indemnification was due, because the lease obligation to follow all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws did not require compliance with the testing requirements of the Oregon Drinking Water Quality Act (Oregon Act); that Act the arbitrator characterized as dealing with human health as distinct from environmental contamination.</p>\n<p>Hall Street then filed a District Court Motion for Order Vacating, Modifying And/Or Correcting the arbitration decision, App. 4, on the ground that failing to treat the Oregon Act as an applicable environmental law under the terms of the lease was legal error. The District Court agreed, vacated the award, and remanded for further consideration by the arbitrator. The court expressly invoked the standard of review chosen by the parties in the arbitration agreement, which included review for legal error, and cited <i>LaPine Technology Corp. v. Kyocera Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"748807\"><a href=\"/opinion/748807/97-cal-daily-op-serv-9183-97-daily-journal-dar-148/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span>, 889 (C.A.9 1997), for the proposition that the FAA leaves the parties \"free. . . to draft a contract that sets rules for arbitration and dictates an alternative standard of review.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.</p>\n<p>On remand, the arbitrator followed the District Court's ruling that the Oregon Act was an applicable environmental law and amended the decision to favor Hall Street. This time, each party sought modification, and again the District Court applied the parties' stipulated standard of review for legal error, correcting the arbitrator's calculation of interest but otherwise upholding the award. Each party then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where Mattel switched horses and contended that the Ninth Circuit's recent en banc action overruling <i>LaPine</i> in <i>Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade Servs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783379\"><a href=\"/opinion/783379/kyocera-corporation-plaintiff-counter-defendant-ap/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span>, 1000 (2003), left the arbitration agreement's provision for judicial review of legal error unenforceable. Hall Street countered that <i>Kyocera</i> (the later one) was distinguishable, and that the agreement's judicial review provision was not severable from the submission to arbitration.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit reversed in favor of Mattel in holding that, \"[u]nder <i>Kyocera</i> the terms of the arbitration agreement controlling the mode of judicial review are unenforceable and severable.\" 113 Fed. Appx. 272, 272-273 (2004). The Circuit instructed the District Court on remand to</p>\n<blockquote>\"return to the application to confirm the original arbitration award (not the subsequent award revised after reversal), and . . . confirm that award, unless . . . the award should be vacated on the grounds allowable under 9 U.S.C. § 10, or modified or corrected under the grounds allowable under 9 U.S.C. § 11.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 273.</blockquote>\n<p>After the District Court again held for Hall Street and the Ninth Circuit again reversed,<sup>[1]</sup> we granted certiorari to decide whether the grounds for vacatur and modification provided by §§ 10 and 11 of the FAA are exclusive. 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2875, 167 L.Ed.2d 1151 (2007). We agree with the Ninth Circuit that they are, but vacate and remand for consideration of independent issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1402</span> II</h2>\n<p>Congress enacted the FAA to replace judicial indisposition to arbitration with a \"national policy favoring [it] and plac[ing] arbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts.\" <i>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145683\"><a href=\"/opinion/145683/buckeye-check-cashing-inc-v-cardegna/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 443, 126 S.Ct. 1204, 163 L.Ed.2d 1038 (2006). As for jurisdiction over controversies touching arbitration, the Act does nothing, being \"something of an anomaly in the field of federal-court jurisdiction\" in bestowing no federal jurisdiction but rather requiring an independent jurisdictional basis. <i>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110873\"><a href=\"/opinion/110873/moses-h-cone-memorial-hospital-v-mercury-constr-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 25, n. 32, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983); see, <i>e.g.,</i> 9 U.S.C. § 4 (providing for action by a federal district court \"which, save for such [arbitration] agreement, would have jurisdiction under title 28\").<sup>[2]</sup> But in cases falling within a court's jurisdiction, the Act makes contracts to arbitrate \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,\" so long as their subject involves \"commerce.\" § 2. And this is so whether an agreement has a broad reach or goes just to one dispute, and whether enforcement be sought in state court or federal. See <i>ibid.; </i><i>Southland Corp. v. Keating,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111091\"><a href=\"/opinion/111091/southland-corp-v-keating/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 15-16, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984).</p>\n<p>The Act also supplies mechanisms for enforcing arbitration awards: a judicial decree confirming an award, an order vacating it, or an order modifying or correcting it. §§ 9-11. An application for any of these orders will get streamlined treatment as a motion, obviating the separate contract action that would usually be necessary to enforce or tinker with an arbitral award in court.<sup>[3]</sup> § 6. Under the terms of § 9, a court \"must\" confirm an arbitration award \"unless\" it is vacated, modified, or corrected \"as prescribed\" in §§ 10 and 11. Section 10 lists grounds for vacating an award, while § 11 names those for modifying or correcting one.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1403</span> The Courts of Appeals have split over the exclusiveness of these statutory grounds when parties take the FAA shortcut to confirm, vacate, or modify an award, with some saying the recitations are exclusive, and others regarding them as mere threshold provisions open to expansion by agreement.<sup>[5]</sup> As mentioned already, when this litigation started, the Ninth Circuit was on the threshold side of the split, see <i>LaPine,</i> 130 F.3d, at 889, from which it later departed en banc in favor of the exclusivity view, see <i>Kyocera,</i> 341 F.3d, at 1000, which it followed in this case, see 113 Fed.Appx., at 273. We now hold that §§ 10 and 11 respectively provide the FAA's exclusive grounds for expedited vacatur and modification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Hall Street makes two main efforts to show that the grounds set out for vacating or modifying an award are not exclusive, taking the position, first, that expandable judicial review authority has been accepted as the law since <i>Wilko v. Swan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105171\"><a href=\"/opinion/105171/wilko-v-swan/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span>, 74 S.Ct. 182, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953). This, however, was not what <i>Wilko</i> decided, which was that § 14 of the Securities Act of 1933 voided any agreement to arbitrate claims of violations of that Act, see <i>id.,</i> at 437-438, 74 S.Ct. 182, a holding since overruled by <i>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112261\"><a href=\"/opinion/112261/rodriguez-de-quijas-v-shearsonamerican-express-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span>, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989). Although it is true that the Court's discussion includes some language arguably favoring Hall Street's position, arguable is as far as it goes.</p>\n<p>The <i>Wilko</i> Court was explaining that arbitration would undercut the Securities Act's buyer protections when it remarked (citing FAA § 10) that \"[p]ower to vacate an [arbitration] award is limited,\" 346 U.S., at 436, 74 S.Ct. 182, and went on to say that \"the interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard [of the law] are not subject, in the federal courts, to judicial review for error in interpretation,\" <i>id.,</i> at 436-437, 74 S.Ct. 182. Hall Street reads this statement as recognizing \"manifest disregard of the law\" as a further ground for vacatur on top of those listed in § 10, and some Circuits have read it the same way. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>McCarthy v. Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795691\"><a href=\"/opinion/795691/james-w-mccarthy-v-citigroup-global-markets-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 91 (CA1 2006); <i>Hoeft v. MVL Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783506\"><a href=\"/opinion/783506/richard-hoeft-iii-individually-and-as-trustee-unde/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 64 (CA2 2003); <i>Prestige Ford v. Ford Dealer Computer Servs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"30588\"><a href=\"/opinion/30588/prestige-ford-v-ford-dealer-computer/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, 395-396 (C.A.5 2003); <i>Scott v.

Hall Street sees this supposed addition to § 10 as the camel's nose: if judges can add grounds to vacate (or modify), so can contracting parties.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1404</span> But this is too much for <i>Wilko</i> to bear. Quite apart from its leap from a supposed judicial expansion by interpretation to a private expansion by contract, Hall Street overlooks the fact that the statement it relies on expressly rejects just what Hall Street asks for here, general review for an arbitrator's legal errors. Then there is the vagueness of <i>Wilko</i>'s phrasing. Maybe the term \"manifest disregard\" was meant to name a new ground for review, but maybe it merely referred to the § 10 grounds collectively, rather than adding to them. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v.

Or, as some courts have thought, \"manifest disregard\" may have been shorthand for § 10(a)(3) or § 10(a)(4), the subsections authorizing vacatur when the arbitrators were \"guilty of misconduct\" or \"exceeded their powers.\" See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Kyocera, supra,</i> at 997. We, when speaking as a Court, have merely taken the <i>Wilko</i> language as we found it, without embellishment, see <i>First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117937\"><a href=\"/opinion/117937/first-options-of-chicago-inc-v-kaplan/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span>, 942, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995), and now that its meaning is implicated, we see no reason to accord it the significance that Hall Street urges.</p>\n<p>Second, Hall Street says that the agreement to review for legal error ought to prevail simply because arbitration is a creature of contract, and the FAA is \"motivated, first and foremost, by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into which parties ha[ve] entered.\" <i>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111361\"><a href=\"/opinion/111361/dean-witter-reynolds-inc-v-byrd/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 220, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985). But, again, we think the argument comes up short. Hall Street is certainly right that the FAA lets parties tailor some, even many features of arbitration by contract, including the way arbitrators are chosen, what their qualifications should be, which issues are arbitrable, along with procedure and choice of substantive law. But to rest this case on the general policy of treating arbitration agreements as enforceable as such would be to beg the question, which is whether the FAA has textual features at odds with enforcing a contract to expand judicial review following the arbitration.</p>\n<p>To that particular question we think the answer is yes, that the text compels a reading of the §§10 and 11 categories as exclusive. To begin with, even if we assumed §§ 10 and 11 could be supplemented to some extent, it would stretch basic interpretive principles to expand the stated grounds to the point of evidentiary and legal review generally. Sections 10 and 11, after all, address egregious departures from the parties' agreed-upon arbitration: \"corruption,\" \"fraud,\" \"evident partiality,\" \"misconduct,\" \"misbehavior,\" \"exceed[ing] . . . powers,\" \"evident material miscalculation,\" \"evident material mistake,\" \"award[s] upon a matter not submitted;\" the only ground with any softer focus is \"imperfect[ions],\" and a court may correct those only if they go to \"[a] matter of form not affecting the merits.\" Given this emphasis on extreme arbitral conduct, the old rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> has an implicit lesson to teach here. Under that rule, when a statute sets out a series of specific items ending with a general term, that general term is confined to covering subjects comparable to the specifics it follows. Since a general term included in the text is normally so limited, then surely a statute with no textual hook for expansion cannot authorize contracting parties to supplement review for specific instances of outrageous conduct with review for just <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1405</span> any legal error. \"Fraud\" and a mistake of law are not cut from the same cloth.</p>\n<p>That aside, expanding the detailed categories would rub too much against the grain of the § 9 language, where provision for judicial confirmation carries no hint of flexibility. On application for an order confirming the arbitration award, the court \"must grant\" the order \"unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of this title.\" There is nothing malleable about \"must grant,\" which unequivocally tells courts to grant confirmation in all cases, except when one of the \"prescribed\" exceptions applies. This does not sound remotely like a provision meant to tell a court what to do just in case the parties say nothing else.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>In fact, anyone who thinks Congress might have understood § 9 as a default provision should turn back to § 5 for an example of what Congress thought a default provision would look like:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[i]f in the agreement provision be made for a method of naming or appointing an arbitrator . . . such method shall be followed; but if no method be provided therein, or if a method be provided and any party thereto shall fail to avail himself of such method, . . . then upon the application of either party to the controversy the court shall designate and appoint an arbitrator. . . . .\"</blockquote>\n<p>\"[I]f no method be provided\" is a far cry from \"must grant . . . unless\" in § 9.</p>\n<p>Instead of fighting the text, it makes more sense to see the three provisions, §§ 9-11, as substantiating a national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitration's essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway. Any other reading opens the door to the full-bore legal and evidentiary appeals that can \"rende[r] informal arbitration merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time-consuming judicial review process,\" <i>Kyocera,</i> 341 F.3d, at 998; cf. <i>Ethyl Corp. v. United Steelworkers of America,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"455886\"><a href=\"/opinion/455886/ethyl-corporation-v-united-steelworkers-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">768</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span>, 184 (C.A.7 1985), and bring arbitration theory to grief in post-arbitration process.</p>\n<p>Nor is <i>Dean Witter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111361\"><a href=\"/opinion/111361/dean-witter-reynolds-inc-v-byrd/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158, to the contrary, as Hall Street claims it to be. <i>Dean Witter</i> held that state-law claims subject to an agreement to arbitrate could not be remitted to a district court considering a related, nonarbitrable federal claim; the state-law claims were to go to arbitration immediately. <i>Id.,</i> at 217, 105 S.Ct. 1238. Despite the opinion's language \"reject[ing] the suggestion that the overriding goal of the [FAA] was to promote the expeditious <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1406</span> resolution of claims,\" <i>id.,</i> at 219, 105 S.Ct. 1238, the holding mandated immediate enforcement of an arbitration agreement; the Court was merely trying to explain that the inefficiency and difficulty of conducting simultaneous arbitration and federal-court litigation was not a good enough reason to defer the arbitration, see <i>id.,</i> at 217, 105 S.Ct. 1238.</p>\n<p>When all these arguments based on prior legal authority are done with, Hall Street and Mattel remain at odds over what happens next. Hall Street and its <i>amici</i> say parties will flee from arbitration if expanded review is not open to them. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Petitioner 39; Brief for New England Legal Foundation et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 15. One of Mattel's <i>amici</i> foresees flight from the courts if it is. See Brief for U.S. Council for Int'l Business as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 29-30. We do not know who, if anyone, is right, and so cannot say whether the exclusivity reading of the statute is more of a threat to the popularity of arbitrators or to that of courts. But whatever the consequences of our holding, the statutory text gives us no business to expand the statutory grounds.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>In holding that §§ 10 and 11 provide exclusive regimes for the review provided by the statute, we do not purport to say that they exclude more searching review based on authority outside the statute as well. The FAA is not the only way into court for parties wanting review of arbitration awards: they may contemplate enforcement under state statutory or common law, for example, where judicial review of different scope is arguable. But here we speak only to the scope of the expeditious judicial review under §§ 9, 10, and 11, deciding nothing about other possible avenues for judicial enforcement of arbitration awards.</p>\n<p>Although one such avenue is now claimed to be revealed in the procedural <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1407</span> history of this case, no claim to it was presented when the case arrived on our doorstep, and no reason then appeared to us for treating this as anything but an FAA case. There was never any question about meeting the FAA § 2 requirement that the leases from which the dispute arose be contracts \"involving commerce.\" 9 U.S.C. § 2; see <i>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117892\"><a href=\"/opinion/117892/allied-bruce-terminix-cos-v-dobson/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 277, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995) (§ 2 \"exercise[s] Congress' commerce power to the full\"). Nor is there any doubt now that the parties at least had the FAA in mind at the outset; the arbitration agreement even incorporates FAA § 7, empowering arbitrators to compel attendance of witnesses. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a.</p>\n<p>While it is true that the agreement does not expressly invoke FAA § 9, § 10, or § 11, and none of the various motions to vacate or modify the award expressly said that the parties were relying on the FAA, the District Court apparently thought it was applying the FAA when it alluded to the Act in quoting <i>LaPine,</i> 130 F.3d, at 889, for the then-unexceptional proposition that \"`[f]ederal courts can expand their review of an arbitration award beyond the FAA's grounds, when . . . the parties have so agreed.'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. And the Ninth Circuit, for its part, seemed to take it as a given that the District Court's direct and prompt examination of the award depended on the FAA; it found the expanded-review provision unenforceable under <i>Kyocera</i> and remanded for confirmation of the original award \"unless the district court determines that the award should be vacated on the grounds allowable under 9 U.S.C. § 10, or modified or corrected under the grounds allowable under 9 U.S.C. § 11.\" 113 Fed.Appx., at 273. In the petition for certiorari and the principal briefing before us, the parties acted on the same premise. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Pet. for Cert. 27 (\"This Court should accept review to resolve this important issue of statutory construction under the FAA\"); Brief for Petitioner 16 (\"Because arbitration provisions providing for judicial review of arbitration awards for legal error are consistent with the goals and policies of the FAA and employ a standard of review which district courts regularly apply in a variety of contexts, those provisions are entitled to enforcement under the FAA\").</p>\n<p>One unusual feature, however, prompted some of us to question whether the case should be approached another way. The arbitration agreement was entered into in the course of district-court litigation, was submitted to the District Court as a request to deviate from the standard sequence of trial procedure, and was adopted by the District Court as an order. See App. 46-47; App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a-8a. Hence a question raised by this Court at oral argument: should the agreement be treated as an exercise of the District Court's authority to manage its cases under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 16? See, <i>e.g.,</i> Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12. Supplemental briefing at the Court's behest joined issue on the question, and it appears that Hall Street suggested something along these lines in the Court of Appeals, which did not address the suggestion.</p>\n<p>We are, however, in no position to address the question now, beyond noting the claim of relevant case management authority independent of the FAA. The parties' supplemental arguments on the subject in this Court implicate issues of waiver and the relation of the FAA both to Rule 16 and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998, 28 U.S.C. § 651 <i>et seq.,</i> none of which has been considered previously in this litigation, or could be well addressed for the first time here. We express no opinion on these matters beyond leaving them open for Hall Street to press on remand. If the Court of Appeals finds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1408</span> they are open, the court may consider whether the District Court's authority to manage litigation independently warranted that court's order on the mode of resolving the indemnification issues remaining in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Although we agree with the Ninth Circuit that the FAA confines its expedited judicial review to the grounds listed in 9 U.S.C. §§ 10 and 11, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice KENNEDY joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>May parties to an ongoing lawsuit agree to submit their dispute to arbitration subject to the caveat that the trial judge should refuse to enforce an award that rests on an erroneous conclusion of law? Prior to Congress' enactment of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) in 1925, the answer to that question would surely have been \"Yes.\"<sup>[1]</sup> Today, however, the Court holds that the FAA does not merely authorize the vacation or enforcement of awards on specified grounds, but also forbids enforcement of perfectly reasonable judicial review provisions in arbitration agreements fairly negotiated by the parties and approved by the district court. Because this result conflicts with the primary purpose of the FAA and ignores the historical context in which the Act was passed, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Prior to the passage of the FAA, American courts were generally hostile to arbitration. They refused, with rare exceptions, to order specific enforcement of executory agreements to arbitrate.<sup>[2]</sup> Section 2 of the FAA responded to this hostility by making written arbitration agreements \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.\" 9 U.S.C. § 2. This section, which is the centerpiece of the FAA, reflects Congress' main goal in passing the legislation: \"to abrogate the general common-law rule against specific enforcement of arbitration agreements,\" <i>Southland Corp. v. Keating,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111091\"><a href=\"/opinion/111091/southland-corp-v-keating/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 18, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and to \"ensur[e] that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms,\" <i>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112212\"><a href=\"/opinion/112212/volt-info-sciences-inc-v-bd-of-trustees-of-leland-/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, 478, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989). Given this settled understanding of the core purpose of the FAA, the interests favoring enforceability of parties' arbitration agreements are stronger today than before the FAA was enacted. As such, there is moreand certainly not lessreason to give effect to parties' fairly negotiated decisions to provide for judicial review of arbitration awards for errors of law.</p>\n<p>Petitioner filed this rather complex action in an Oregon state court. Based on the diverse citizenship of the parties, respondent removed the case to federal court. More than three years later, and after some issues had been resolved, the parties sought and obtained the District <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1409</span> Court's approval of their agreement to arbitrate the remaining issues subject to <i>de novo</i> judicial review. They neither requested, nor suggested that the FAA authorized, any \"expedited\" disposition of their case. Because the arbitrator made a rather glaring error of law, the judge refused to affirm his award until after that error was corrected. The Ninth Circuit reversed.</p>\n<p>This Court now agrees with the Ninth Circuit's (most recent) interpretation of the FAA as setting forth the exclusive grounds for modification or vacation of an arbitration award under the statute. As I read the Court's opinion, it identifies two possible reasons for reaching this result: (1) a supposed <i>quid pro quo</i> bargain between Congress and litigants that conditions expedited federal enforcement of arbitration awards on acceptance of a statutory limit on the scope of judicial review of such awards; and (2) an assumption that Congress intended to include the words \"and no other\" in the grounds specified in §§ 10 and 11 for the vacatur and modification of awards. Neither reason is persuasive.</p>\n<p>While § 9 of the FAA imposes a 1-year limit on the time in which any party to an arbitration may apply for confirmation of an award, the statute does not require that the application be given expedited treatment. Of course, the premise of the entire statute is an assumption that the arbitration process may be more expeditious and less costly than ordinary litigation, but that is a reason for interpreting the statute liberally to favor the parties' use of arbitration. An unnecessary refusal to enforce a perfectly reasonable category of arbitration agreements defeats the primary purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p>That purpose also provides a sufficient response to the Court's reliance on statutory text. It is true that a wooden application of \"the old rule of <i>ejusdem generis,</i>\" <i>ante,</i> at 1404, might support an inference that the categories listed in §§ 10 and 11 are exclusive, but the literal text does not compel that readinga reading that is flatly inconsistent with the overriding interest in effectuating the clearly expressed intent of the contracting parties. A listing of grounds that must always be available to contracting parties simply does not speak to the question whether they may agree to additional grounds for judicial review.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in light of the historical context and the broader purpose of the FAA, §§ 10 and 11 are best understood as a shield meant to protect parties from hostile courts, not a sword with which to cut down parties' \"valid, irrevocable and enforceable\" agreements to arbitrate their disputes subject to judicial review for errors of law.<sup>[3]</sup> § 2.</p>\n<p>Even if I thought the narrow issue presented in this case were as debatable as the conflict among the courts of appeals suggests, I would rely on a presumption of overriding importance to resolve the debate and rule in favor of petitioner's position that the FAA permits the statutory grounds for vacatur and modification of an award to be supplemented by contract. A decision \"<i>not to regulate</i>\" the terms of an agreement that does not even arguably offend any public policy whatsoever, \"is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1410</span> adequately justified by a presumption in favor of freedom.\" <i>FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112870\"><a href=\"/opinion/112870/fcc-v-beach-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 320, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, while I agree that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be set aside, and that there may be additional avenues available for judicial enforcement of parties' fairly negotiated review provisions, see, <i>ante,</i> at 1406-1408, I respectfully dissent from the Court's interpretation of the FAA, and would direct the Court of Appeals to affirm the judgment of the District Court enforcing the arbitrator's final award.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The question presented in this case is whether \"the Federal Arbitration Act . . . <i>precludes</i> a federal court from enforcing\" an arbitration agreement that gives the court the power to set aside an arbitration award that embodies an arbitrator's mistake about the law. Pet. for Cert. i. Like the majority and Justice STEVENS, and primarily for the reasons they set forth, I believe that the Act does not <i>preclude</i> enforcement of such an agreement. See <i>ante,</i> at 1406-1407 (opinion of the Court) (The Act \"is not the only way into court for parties wanting review of arbitration awards\"); <i>ante,</i> at 1409-1410 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (The Act is a \"shield meant to protect parties from hostile courts, not a sword with which to cut down parties' `valid, irrevocable and enforceable' agreements to arbitrate their disputes subject to judicial review for errors of law\").</p>\n<p>At the same time, I see no need to send the case back for further judicial decisionmaking. The agreement here was entered into with the consent of the parties and the approval of the District Court. Aside from the Federal Arbitration Act itself, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <i>et seq.,</i> respondent below pointed to no statute, rule, or other relevant public policy that the agreement might violate. The Court has now rejected its argument that the agreement violates the Act, and I would simply remand the case with instructions that the Court of Appeals affirm the District Court's judgment enforcing the arbitrator's final award.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Justice SCALIA joins all but footnote 7 of this opinion.</p>\n<p>[1]  On remand, the District Court vacated the arbitration award, because it supposedly rested on an implausible interpretation of the lease and thus exceeded the arbitrator's powers, in violation of 9 U.S.C. § 10. Mattel appealed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that implausibility is not a valid ground for vacating or correcting an award under § 10 or § 11. 196 Fed.Appx. 476, 477-478 (2006).</p>\n<p>[2]  Because the FAA is not jurisdictional, there is no merit in the argument that enforcing the arbitration agreement's judicial review provision would create federal jurisdiction by private contract. The issue is entirely about the scope of judicial review permissible under the FAA.</p>\n<p>[3]  Unlike Justice STEVENS, see <i>post,</i> at 1408-1409 (dissenting opinion), we understand this expedited review to be what each of the parties understood it was seeking from time to time; neither party's pleadings were amended to raise an independent state-law contract claim or defense specific to the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>[4]  Title 9 U.S.C. § 10(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) provides:\n</p>\n<p>\"(a) In any of the following cases the United States court in and for the district wherein the award was made may make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration </p>\n<p>\"(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means;</p>\n<p>\"(2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them;</p>\n<p>\"(3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or</p>\n<p>\"(4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\"</p>\n<p>Title 9 U.S.C. § 11 (2000 ed.) provides:</p>\n<p>\"In either of the following cases the United States court in and for the district wherein the award was made may make an order modifying or correcting the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration</p>\n<p>\"(a) Where there was an evident material miscalculation of figures or an evident material mistake in the description of any person, thing, or property referred to in the award.</p>\n<p>\"(b) Where the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them, unless it is a matter not affecting the merits of the decision upon the matter submitted.</p>\n<p>\"(c) Where the award is imperfect in matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy.</p>\n<p>\"The order may modify and correct the award, so as to effect the intent thereof and promote justice between the parties.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  The Ninth and Tenth Circuits have held that parties may not contract for expanded judicial review.

It is a peculiar argument, converting agreement as a necessary condition for judicial enforcement into a sufficient condition for a court to bar enforcement. And the text is otherwise problematical for Hall Street: § 9 says that if the parties have agreed to judicial enforcement, the court \"must grant\" confirmation unless grounds for vacatur or modification exist under § 10 or § 11. The sentence nowhere predicates the court's judicial action on the parties' having agreed to specific standards; if anything, it suggests that, so long as the parties contemplated judicial enforcement, the court must undertake such enforcement under the statutory criteria. In any case, the arbitration agreement here did not specifically predicate entry of judgment on adherence to its judicial-review standard. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 15a. To the extent Hall Street argues otherwise, it contests not the meaning of the FAA but the Ninth Circuit's severability analysis, upon which it did not seek certiorari.</p>\n<p>[7]  The history of the FAA is consistent with our conclusion. The text of the FAA was based upon that of New York's arbitration statute. See S.Rep. No. 536, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1924) (\"The bill . . . follows the lines of the New York arbitration law enacted in 1920. . .\"). The New York Arbitration Law incorporated pre-existing provisions of the New York Code of Civil Procedure. See 1920 N.Y. Laws p. 806. Section 2373 of the code said that, upon application by a party for a confirmation order, \"the court must grant such an order, unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected, as prescribed by the next two sections.\" 2 N.Y.

If the award [meets a condition of § 10], then and then only the award may be vacated. . . . If there was [an error under § 11], then and then only it may be modified or corrected . . . .\" Arbitration of Interstate Commercial Disputes, Joint Hearings before the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary on S. 1005 and H.R. 646, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 34 (1924).

MATTEL, INC.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 06–989.      Argued November 7, 2007—Decided March 25, 2008\nThe Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §§9–11, provides expe\n  dited judicial review to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitration awards.\n  Under §9, a court “must” confirm an award “unless” it is vacated,\n  modified, or corrected “as prescribed” in §§10 and 11. Section 10 lists\n  grounds for vacating an award, including where the award was pro\n  cured by “corruption,” “fraud,” or “undue means,” and where the arbi\n  trators were “guilty of misconduct,” or “exceeded their powers.” Un\n  der §11, the grounds for modifying or correcting an award include\n  “evident material miscalculation,” “evident material mistake,” and\n  “imperfect[ions] in [a] matter of form not affecting the merits.”\n     After a bench trial sustained respondent tenant’s (Mattel) right to\n  terminate its lease with petitioner landlord (Hall Street), the parties\n  proposed to arbitrate Hall Street’s claim for indemnification of the\n  costs of cleaning up the lease site. The District Court approved, and\n  entered as an order, the parties’ arbitration agreement, which, inter\n  alia, required the court to vacate, modify, or correct any award if the\n  arbitrator’s conclusions of law were erroneous. The arbitrator de\n  cided for Mattel, but the District Court vacated the award for legal\n  error, expressly invoking the agreement’s legal-error review standard\n  and citing the Ninth Circuit’s LaPine decision for the proposition that\n  the FAA allows parties to draft a contract dictating an alternative re\n  view standard. On remand, the arbitrator ruled for Hall Street, and\n  the District Court largely upheld the award, again applying the par\n  ties’ stipulated review standard. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding\n  the case controlled by its Kyocera decision, which had overruled LaP\n  ine on the ground that arbitration-agreement terms fixing the mode\n  of judicial review are unenforceable, given the exclusive grounds for\n  vacatur and modification provided by FAA §§10 and 11.\n2      HALL STREET ASSOCIATES, L.L.C. v. MATTEL, INC.\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld:\n    1. The FAA’s grounds for prompt vacatur and modification of\n awards are exclusive for parties seeking expedited review under the\n FAA. The Court rejects Hall Street’s two arguments to the contrary.\n First, Hall Street submits that expandable judicial review has been\n accepted as the law since Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427. Although a\n Wilko statement—“the interpretations of the law by the arbitrators\n in contrast to manifest disregard are not subject, in the federal\n courts, to judicial review for error in interpretation,” id., at 436–437\n (emphasis added)—arguably favors Hall Street’s position, arguable is\n as far as it goes. Quite apart from the leap from a supposed judicial\n expansion by interpretation to a private expansion by contract, Hall\n Street overlooks the fact that the Wilko statement expressly rejects\n just what Hall Street asks for here, general review for an arbitrator’s\n legal errors. Moreover, Wilko’s phrasing is too vague to support Hall\n Street’s interpretation, since “manifest disregard” can be read as\n merely referring to the §10 grounds collectively, rather than adding\n to them, see, e.g., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-\n Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 656, or as shorthand for the §10 sub\n sections authorizing vacatur when arbitrators were “guilty of mis\n conduct” or “exceeded their powers.” Second, Hall Street says that\n the agreement to review for legal error ought to prevail simply be\n cause arbitration is a creature of contract, and the FAA is motivated\n by a congressional desire to enforce such agreements. Dean Witter\n Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 220. This argument comes up\n short because, although there may be a general policy favoring arbi\n tration, the FAA has textual features at odds with enforcing a con\n tract to expand judicial review once the arbitration is over. Even as\n suming §§10 and 11 could be supplemented to some extent, it would\n stretch basic interpretive principles to expand their uniformly narrow\n stated grounds to the point of legal review generally. But §9 makes\n evident that expanding §10’s and §11’s detailed categories at all\n would rub too much against the grain: §9 carries no hint of flexibility\n in unequivocally telling courts that they “must” confirm an arbitral\n award, “unless” it is vacated or modified “as prescribed” by §§10 and\n 11. Instead of fighting the text, it makes more sense to see §§9–11 as\n the substance of a national policy favoring arbitration with just the\n limited review needed to maintain arbitration’s essential virtue of re\n solving disputes straightaway. Dean Witter, supra, at 217, 219, dis\n tinguished. Pp. 7–12.\n    2. In holding the §10 and §11 grounds exclusive with regard to en\n forcement under the FAA’s expedited judicial review mechanisms,\n this Court decides nothing about other possible avenues for judicial\n enforcement of awards. Accordingly, this case must be remanded for\n                      Cite as: 552 U.

Because the arbitration agree\n  ment was entered into during litigation, was submitted to the Dis\n  trict Court as a request to deviate from the standard sequence of liti\n  gation procedure, and was adopted by the court as an order, there is\n  some question whether it should be treated as an exercise of the Dis\n  trict Court’s authority to manage its cases under Federal Rule of\n  Civil Procedure 16. This Court ordered supplemental briefing on the\n  issue, but the parties’ supplemental arguments implicate issues that\n  have not been considered previously in this litigation and could not\n  be well addressed for the first time here. Thus, the Court expresses\n  no opinion on these matters beyond leaving them open for Hall Street\n  to press on remand. Pp. 13–15.\n196 Fed.

MATTEL, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmanufacturing discharges by Mattel’s predecessors be\ntween 1951 and 1980. After the Oregon Department of\nEnvironmental Quality (DEQ) discovered even more pol\nlutants, Mattel stopped drawing from the well and, along\nwith one of its predecessors, signed a consent order with\nthe DEQ providing for cleanup of the site.\n  After Mattel gave notice of intent to terminate the lease\nin 2001, Hall Street filed this suit, contesting Mattel’s\nright to vacate on the date it gave, and claiming that the\nlease obliged Mattel to indemnify Hall Street for costs of\ncleaning up the TCE, among other things. Following a\nbench trial before the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Oregon, Mattel won on the termination issue,\nand after an unsuccessful try at mediating the indemnifi\ncation claim, the parties proposed to submit to arbitration.\nThe District Court was amenable, and the parties drew up\nan arbitration agreement, which the court approved and\nentered as an order. One paragraph of the agreement\nprovided that\n    “[t]he United States District Court for the District of\n    Oregon may enter judgment upon any award, either\n    by confirming the award or by vacating, modifying or\n    correcting the award. The Court shall vacate, modify\n    or correct any award: (i) where the arbitrator’s find\n    ings of facts are not supported by substantial evi\n    dence, or (ii) where the arbitrator’s conclusions of law\n    are erroneous.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a.\nArbitration took place, and the arbitrator decided for\nMattel. In particular, he held that no indemnification was\ndue, because the lease obligation to follow all applicable\nfederal, state, and local environmental laws did not re\nquire compliance with the testing requirements of the\nOregon Drinking Water Quality Act (Oregon Act); that Act\nthe arbitrator characterized as dealing with human health\nas distinct from environmental contamination.\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Hall Street then filed a District Court Motion for Order\nVacating, Modifying And/Or Correcting the arbitration\ndecision, App. 4, on the ground that failing to treat the\nOregon Act as an applicable environmental law under the\nterms of the lease was legal error. The District Court\nagreed, vacated the award, and remanded for further\nconsideration by the arbitrator. The court expressly in\nvoked the standard of review chosen by the parties in the\narbitration agreement, which included review for legal\nerror, and cited LaPine Technology Corp. v. Kyocera Corp.,\n130 F. 3d 884, 889 (CA9 1997), for the proposition that the\nFAA leaves the parties “free . . . to draft a contract that\nsets rules for arbitration and dictates an alternative stan\ndard of review.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.\n   On remand, the arbitrator followed the District Court’s\nruling that the Oregon Act was an applicable environ\nmental law and amended the decision to favor Hall Street.\nThis time, each party sought modification, and again the\nDistrict Court applied the parties’ stipulated standard of\nreview for legal error, correcting the arbitrator’s calcula\ntion of interest but otherwise upholding the award. Each\nparty then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit, where Mattel switched horses and contended that\nthe Ninth Circuit’s recent en banc action overruling LaP\nine in Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade Servs.,\nInc., 341 F. 3d 987, 1000 (2003), left the arbitration\nagreement’s provision for judicial review of legal error\nunenforceable. Hall Street countered that Kyocera (the\nlater one) was distinguishable, and that the agreement’s\njudicial review provision was not severable from the sub\nmission to arbitration.\n   The Ninth Circuit reversed in favor of Mattel in holding\nthat, “[u]nder Kyocera the terms of the arbitration agree\nment controlling the mode of judicial review are unen\nforceable and severable.” 113 Fed. Appx. 272, 272–273\n(2004). The Circuit instructed the District Court on re\n4      HALL STREET ASSOCIATES, L.L.C. v.

S. C. §10, or modified or corrected under\n     the grounds allowable under 9 U. S. C. §11.” Id., at\n     273.\nAfter the District Court again held for Hall Street and the\nNinth Circuit again reversed,1 we granted certiorari to\ndecide whether the grounds for vacatur and modification\nprovided by §§10 and 11 of the FAA are exclusive. 550\nU. S. __ (2007). We agree with the Ninth Circuit that they\nare, but vacate and remand for consideration of independ\nent issues.\n                             II\n   Congress enacted the FAA to replace judicial indisposi\ntion to arbitration with a “national policy favoring [it] and\nplac[ing] arbitration agreements on equal footing with all\nother contracts.”      Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v.\nCardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 443 (2006). As for jurisdiction\nover controversies touching arbitration, the Act does noth\ning, being “something of an anomaly in the field of federal-\ncourt jurisdiction” in bestowing no federal jurisdiction but\nrather requiring an independent jurisdictional basis.\nMoses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr.\nCorp., 460 U. S. 1, 25, n. 32 (1983); see, e.g., 9 U. S. C. §4\n(providing for action by a federal district court “which,\n\n——————\n  1 On remand, the District Court vacated the arbitration award, be\n\ncause it supposedly rested on an implausible interpretation of the lease\nand thus exceeded the arbitrator’s powers, in violation of 9 U. S. C. §10.\nMattel appealed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that implau\nsibility is not a valid ground for vacating or correcting an award under\n§10 or §11. 196 Fed. Appx. 476, 477–478 (2006).\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

And this is so whether an\nagreement has a broad reach or goes just to one dispute,\nand whether enforcement be sought in state court or\nfederal. See ibid.; Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1,\n15–16 (1984).\n   The Act also supplies mechanisms for enforcing arbitra\ntion awards: a judicial decree confirming an award, an\norder vacating it, or an order modifying or correcting it.\n§§9–11. An application for any of these orders will get\nstreamlined treatment as a motion, obviating the separate\ncontract action that would usually be necessary to enforce\nor tinker with an arbitral award in court.3 §6. Under the\nterms of §9, a court “must” confirm an arbitration award\n“unless” it is vacated, modified, or corrected “as pre\nscribed” in §§10 and 11. Section 10 lists grounds for vacat\ning an award, while §11 names those for modifying or\ncorrecting one.4\n——————\n  2 Because the FAA is not jurisdictional, there is no merit in the argu\n\nment that enforcing the arbitration agreement’s judicial review provi\nsion would create federal jurisdiction by private contract. The issue is\nentirely about the scope of judicial review permissible under the FAA.\n  3 Unlike JUSTICE STEVENS, see post, at 2 (dissenting opinion), we un\n\nderstand this expedited review to be what each of the parties under\nstood it was seeking from time to time; neither party’s pleadings were\namended to raise an independent state-law contract claim or defense\nspecific to the arbitration agreement.\n  4 Title 9 U. S. C. §10(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) provides:\n\n  “(a) In any of the following cases the United States court in and for\nthe district wherein the award was made may make an order vacating\nthe award upon the application of any party to the arbitration—\n  “(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue\nmeans;\n  “(2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitra\ntors, or either of them;\n6       HALL STREET ASSOCIATES, L.L.C. v. MATTEL, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Courts of Appeals have split over the exclusiveness\nof these statutory grounds when parties take the FAA\nshortcut to confirm, vacate, or modify an award, with some\nsaying the recitations are exclusive, and others regarding\nthem as mere threshold provisions open to expansion by\nagreement.5 As mentioned already, when this litigation\n——————\n   “(3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to\npostpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to\nhear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other\nmisbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or\n   “(4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly\nexecuted them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the\nsubject matter submitted was not made.”\n   Title 9 U. S. C. §11 (2000 ed.) provides:\n   “In either of the following cases the United States court in and for the\ndistrict wherein the award was made may make an order modifying or\ncorrecting the award upon the application of any party to the arbitra\ntion—\n   “(a) Where there was an evident material miscalculation of figures or\nan evident material mistake in the description of any person, thing, or\nproperty referred to in the award.\n   “(b) Where the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submit\nted to them, unless it is a matter not affecting the merits of the decision\nupon the matter submitted.\n   “(c) Where the award is imperfect in matter of form not affecting the\nmerits of the controversy.\n   “The order may modify and correct the award, so as to effect the\nintent thereof and promote justice between the parties.”\n   5 The Ninth and Tenth Circuits have held that parties may not con\n\ntract for expanded judicial review. See Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-\nBache Trade Servs., Inc., 341 F. 3d 987, 1000 (CA9 2003); Bowen v.\nAmoco Pipeline Co., 254 F. 3d 925, 936 (CA10 2001). The First, Third,\nFifth, and Sixth Circuits, meanwhile, have held that parties may so\ncontract. See Puerto Rico Tel. Co. v. U. S. Phone Mfg. Corp., 427 F. 3d\n21, 31 (CA1 2005); Jacada (Europe), Ltd. v. International Marketing\nStrategies, Inc., 401 F. 3d 701, 710 (CA6 2005); Roadway Package\nSystem, Inc. v.

The Fourth Circuit has taken the latter side of the split in an\nunpublished opinion, see Syncor Int’l Corp. v. McLeland, 120 F. 3d 262\n(1997), while the Eighth Circuit has expressed agreement with the\nformer side in dicta, see UHC Management Co. v. Computer Sciences\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)        7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstarted, the Ninth Circuit was on the threshold side of the\nsplit, see LaPine, 130 F. 3d, at 889, from which it later\ndeparted en banc in favor of the exclusivity view, see\nKyocera, 341 F. 3d, at 1000, which it followed in this case,\nsee 113 Fed. Appx., at 273. We now hold that §§10 and 11\nrespectively provide the FAA’s exclusive grounds for expe\ndited vacatur and modification.\n                               III\n   Hall Street makes two main efforts to show that the\ngrounds set out for vacating or modifying an award are not\nexclusive, taking the position, first, that expandable judi\ncial review authority has been accepted as the law since\nWilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427 (1953). This, however, was\nnot what Wilko decided, which was that §14 of the Securi\nties Act of 1933 voided any agreement to arbitrate claims\nof violations of that Act, see id., at 437–438, a holding\nsince overruled by Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shear-\nson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989).\nAlthough it is true that the Court’s discussion includes\nsome language arguably favoring Hall Street’s position,\narguable is as far as it goes.\n   The Wilko Court was explaining that arbitration would\nundercut the Securities Act’s buyer protections when it\nremarked (citing FAA §10) that “[p]ower to vacate an\n[arbitration] award is limited,” 346 U. S., at 436, and went\non to say that “the interpretations of the law by the arbi\ntrators in contrast to manifest disregard [of the law] are\nnot subject, in the federal courts, to judicial review for\nerror in interpretation,” id., at 436–437. Hall Street reads\nthis statement as recognizing “manifest disregard of the\nlaw” as a further ground for vacatur on top of those listed\nin §10, and some Circuits have read it the same way. See,\ne.g., McCarthy v. Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., 463 F. 3d\n—————— \n\nCorp., 148 F. 3d 992, 997–998 (1998). \n\n8     HALL STREET ASSOCIATES, L.L.C. v. MATTEL, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n87, 91 (CA1 2006); Hoeft v. MVL Group, Inc., 343 F. 3d 57,\n64 (CA2 2003); Prestige Ford v. Ford Dealer Computer\nServs., Inc., 324 F. 3d 391, 395–396 (CA5 2003); Scott v.\nPrudential Securities, Inc., 141 F. 3d 1007, 1017 (CA11\n1998). Hall Street sees this supposed addition to §10 as\nthe camel’s nose: if judges can add grounds to vacate (or\nmodify), so can contracting parties.\n   But this is too much for Wilko to bear. Quite apart from\nits leap from a supposed judicial expansion by interpreta\ntion to a private expansion by contract, Hall Street over\nlooks the fact that the statement it relies on expressly\nrejects just what Hall Street asks for here, general review\nfor an arbitrator’s legal errors. Then there is the vague\nness of Wilko’s phrasing. Maybe the term “manifest disre\ngard” was meant to name a new ground for review, but\nmaybe it merely referred to the §10 grounds collectively,\nrather than adding to them. See, e.g., Mitsubishi Motors\nCorp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 656\n(1985) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“Arbitration awards are\nonly reviewable for manifest disregard of the law, 9\nU. S. C. §§10, 207”); I/S Stavborg v. National Metal Con\nverters, Inc., 500 F. 2d 424, 431 (CA2 1974). Or, as some\ncourts have thought, “manifest disregard” may have been\nshorthand for §10(a)(3) or §10(a)(4), the subsections au\nthorizing vacatur when the arbitrators were “guilty of\nmisconduct” or “exceeded their powers.” See, e.g., Kyocera,\nsupra, at 997. We, when speaking as a Court, have merely\ntaken the Wilko language as we found it, without embel\nlishment, see First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514\nU. S. 938, 942 (1995), and now that its meaning is impli\ncated, we see no reason to accord it the significance that\nHall Street urges.\n   Second, Hall Street says that the agreement to review\nfor legal error ought to prevail simply because arbitration\nis a creature of contract, and the FAA is “motivated, first\nand foremost, by a congressional desire to enforce agree\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nments into which parties ha[ve] entered.” Dean Witter\nReynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 220 (1985). But,\nagain, we think the argument comes up short. Hall Street\nis certainly right that the FAA lets parties tailor some,\neven many features of arbitration by contract, including\nthe way arbitrators are chosen, what their qualifications\nshould be, which issues are arbitrable, along with proce\ndure and choice of substantive law. But to rest this case\non the general policy of treating arbitration agreements as\nenforceable as such would be to beg the question, which is\nwhether the FAA has textual features at odds with enforc\ning a contract to expand judicial review following the\narbitration.\n  To that particular question we think the answer is yes,\nthat the text compels a reading of the §§10 and 11 catego\nries as exclusive. To begin with, even if we assumed §§10\nand 11 could be supplemented to some extent, it would\nstretch basic interpretive principles to expand the stated\ngrounds to the point of evidentiary and legal review gen\nerally. Sections 10 and 11, after all, address egregious\ndepartures from the parties’ agreed-upon arbitration:\n“corruption,” “fraud,” “evident partiality,” “misconduct,”\n“misbehavior,” “exceed[ing]. . . powers,” “evident material\nmiscalculation,” “evident material mistake,” “award[s]\nupon a matter not submitted;” the only ground with any\nsofter focus is “imperfect[ions],” and a court may correct\nthose only if they go to “[a] matter of form not affecting the\nmerits.” Given this emphasis on extreme arbitral conduct,\nthe old rule of ejusdem generis has an implicit lesson to\nteach here. Under that rule, when a statute sets out a\nseries of specific items ending with a general term, that\ngeneral term is confined to covering subjects comparable\nto the specifics it follows. Since a general term included in\nthe text is normally so limited, then surely a statute with\nno textual hook for expansion cannot authorize contract\ning parties to supplement review for specific instances of\noutrageous conduct with review for just any legal error.\n10     HALL STREET ASSOCIATES, L.L.C. v. MATTEL, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n“Fraud” and a mistake of law are not cut from the same\ncloth.\n    That aside, expanding the detailed categories would rub\ntoo much against the grain of the §9 language, where\nprovision for judicial confirmation carries no hint of flexi\nbility. On application for an order confirming the arbitra\ntion award, the court “must grant” the order “unless the\naward is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in\nsections 10 and 11 of this title.” There is nothing malle\nable about “must grant,” which unequivocally tells courts\nto grant confirmation in all cases, except when one of the\n“prescribed” exceptions applies. This does not sound\nremotely like a provision meant to tell a court what to do\njust in case the parties say nothing else.6\n   In fact, anyone who thinks Congress might have under\nstood §9 as a default provision should turn back to §5 for\nan example of what Congress thought a default provision\n——————\n  6 Hall Street claims that §9 supports its position, because it allows a\n\ncourt to confirm an award only “[i]f the parties in their agreement have\nagreed that a judgment of the court shall be entered upon the award\nmade pursuant to the arbitration.” Hall Street argues that this lan\nguage “expresses Congress’s intent that a court must enforce the\nagreement of the parties as to whether, and under what circumstances,\na judgment shall be entered.” Reply Brief for Petitioner 5; see also\nBrief for Petitioner 22–24. It is a peculiar argument, converting\nagreement as a necessary condition for judicial enforcement into a\nsufficient condition for a court to bar enforcement. And the text is\notherwise problematical for Hall Street: §9 says that if the parties have\nagreed to judicial enforcement, the court “must grant” confirmation\nunless grounds for vacatur or modification exist under §10 or §11. The\nsentence nowhere predicates the court’s judicial action on the parties’\nhaving agreed to specific standards; if anything, it suggests that, so\nlong as the parties contemplated judicial enforcement, the court must\nundertake such enforcement under the statutory criteria. In any case,\nthe arbitration agreement here did not specifically predicate entry of\njudgment on adherence to its judicial-review standard. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 15a. To the extent Hall Street argues otherwise, it contests\nnot the meaning of the FAA but the Ninth Circuit’s severability analy\nsis, upon which it did not seek certiorari.\n                   Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)         11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwould look like:\n    “[i]f in the agreement provision be made for a method\n    of naming or appointing an arbitrator. . . such method\n    shall be followed; but if no method be provided\n    therein, or if a method be provided and any party\n    thereto shall fail to avail himself of such method, . . .\n    then upon the application of either party to the\n    controversy the court shall designate and appoint an\n    arbitrator. . . .”\n“[I]f no method be provided” is a far cry from “must grant\n. . . unless” in §9.\n    Instead of fighting the text, it makes more sense to see\nthe three provisions, §§9–11, as substantiating a national\npolicy favoring arbitration with just the limited review\nneeded to maintain arbitration’s essential virtue of resolv\ning disputes straightaway. Any other reading opens the\ndoor to the full-bore legal and evidentiary appeals that can\n“rende[r] informal arbitration merely a prelude to a more\ncumbersome and time-consuming judicial review process,”\nKyocera, 341 F. 3d, at 998; cf. Ethyl Corp. v. United Steel\nworkers of America, 768 F. 2d 180, 184 (CA7 1985),\nand bring arbitration theory to grief in post-arbitration\nprocess.\n    Nor is Dean Witter, 470 U. S. 213, to the contrary, as\nHall Street claims it to be. Dean Witter held that state-\nlaw claims subject to an agreement to arbitrate could not\nbe remitted to a district court considering a related, non-\narbitrable federal claim; the state-law claims were to go to\narbitration immediately. Id., at 217. Despite the opinion’s\nlanguage “reject[ing] the suggestion that the overriding\ngoal of the [FAA] was to promote the expeditious resolu\ntion of claims,” id., at 219, the holding mandated immedi\nate enforcement of an arbitration agreement; the Court\nwas merely trying to explain that the inefficiency and\ndifficulty of conducting simultaneous arbitration and\n12      HALL STREET ASSOCIATES, L.L.C. v. MATTEL, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal-court litigation was not a good enough reason to\ndefer the arbitration, see id., at 217.\n  When all these arguments based on prior legal authority\nare done with, Hall Street and Mattel remain at odds over\nwhat happens next. Hall Street and its amici say parties\nwill flee from arbitration if expanded review is not open to\nthem. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 39; Brief for New\nEngland Legal Foundation et al. as Amici Curiae 15. One\nof Mattel’s amici foresees flight from the courts if it is.\nSee Brief for U. S. Council for Int’l Business as Amicus\nCuriae 29–30. We do not know who, if anyone, is right,\nand so cannot say whether the exclusivity reading of the\nstatute is more of a threat to the popularity of arbitrators\nor to that of courts. But whatever the consequences of our\nholding, the statutory text gives us no business to expand\nthe statutory grounds.7\n——————\n   7 The history of the FAA is consistent with our conclusion. The text of\n\nthe FAA was based upon that of New York’s arbitration statute. See\nS. Rep. No. 536, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1924) (“The bill . . . follows the\nlines of the New York arbitration law enacted in 1920 . . .”). The New\nYork Arbitration Law incorporated pre-existing provisions of the New\nYork Code of Civil Procedure. See 1920 N. Y. Laws p. 806. Section\n2373 of the code said that, upon application by a party for a confirma\ntion order, “the court must grant such an order, unless the award is\nvacated, modified, or corrected, as prescribed by the next two sections.”\n2 N. Y. Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (Stover 6th ed. 1902) (hereinafter Stover).\nThe subsequent sections gave grounds for vacatur and modification or\ncorrection virtually identical to the 9 U. S. C. §§10 and 11 grounds. See\n2 Stover §§2374, 2375.\n   In a brief submitted to the House and Senate Subcommittees of the\nCommittees on the Judiciary, Julius Henry Cohen, one of the primary\ndrafters of both the 1920 New York Act and the proposed FAA, said,\n“The grounds for vacating, modifying, or correcting an award are\nlimited. If the award [meets a condition of §10], then and then only the\naward may be vacated. . . . If there was [an error under §11], then and\nthen only it may be modified or corrected . . . .” Arbitration of Inter\nstate Commercial Disputes, Joint Hearings before the Subcommittees\nof the Committees on the Judiciary on S. 1005 and H. R. 646, 68th\nCong., 1st Sess., 34 (1924). The House Report similarly recognized that\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

The FAA is not the\nonly way into court for parties wanting review of arbitra\ntion awards: they may contemplate enforcement under\nstate statutory or common law, for example, where judicial\nreview of different scope is arguable. But here we speak\nonly to the scope of the expeditious judicial review under\n§§9, 10, and 11, deciding nothing about other possible\navenues for judicial enforcement of arbitration awards.\n   Although one such avenue is now claimed to be revealed\nin the procedural history of this case, no claim to it was\npresented when the case arrived on our doorstep, and no\nreason then appeared to us for treating this as anything\nbut an FAA case. There was never any question about\nmeeting the FAA §2 requirement that the leases from\nwhich the dispute arose be contracts “involving com\nmerce.” 9 U. S. C. §2; see Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v.\nDobson, 513 U. S. 265, 277 (1995) (§2 “exercise[s] Con\ngress’ commerce power to the full”). Nor is there any\ndoubt now that the parties at least had the FAA in mind\nat the outset; the arbitration agreement even incorporates\nFAA §7, empowering arbitrators to compel attendance of\n——————\nan “award may . . . be entered as a judgment, subject to attack by the\nother party for fraud and corruption and similar undue influence, or for\npalpable error in form.” H. R. Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 2\n(1924).\n   In a contemporaneous campaign for the promulgation of a uniform\nstate arbitration law, Cohen contrasted the New York Act with the\nIllinois Arbitration and Awards Act of 1917, which required an arbitra\ntor, at the request of either party, to submit any question of law arising\nduring arbitration to judicial determination. See Handbook of the\nNational Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and\nProceedings 97–98 (1924); 1917 Ill. Laws p. 203.\n14    HALL STREET ASSOCIATES, L.L.C. v. MATTEL, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwitnesses. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a.\n   While it is true that the agreement does not expressly\ninvoke FAA §9, §10, or §11, and none of the various mo\ntions to vacate or modify the award expressly said that the\nparties were relying on the FAA, the District Court appar\nently thought it was applying the FAA when it alluded to\nthe Act in quoting LaPine, 130 F. 3d, at 889, for the then-\nunexceptional proposition that “ ‘[f]ederal courts can ex\npand their review of an arbitration award beyond the\nFAA’s grounds, when . . . the parties have so agreed.’ ”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. And the Ninth Circuit, for its\npart, seemed to take it as a given that the District Court’s\ndirect and prompt examination of the award depended on\nthe FAA; it found the expanded-review provision unen\nforceable under Kyocera and remanded for confirmation of\nthe original award “unless the district court determines\nthat the award should be vacated on the grounds allow\nable under 9 U. S. C. §10, or modified or corrected under\nthe grounds allowable under 9 U. S. C. §11.” 113 Fed.\nAppx., at 273. In the petition for certiorari and the princi\npal briefing before us, the parties acted on the same prem\nise. See, e.g., Pet. for Cert. 27 (“This Court should accept\nreview to resolve this important issue of statutory con\nstruction under the FAA”); Brief for Petitioner 16 (“Be\ncause arbitration provisions providing for judicial review\nof arbitration awards for legal error are consistent with\nthe goals and policies of the FAA and employ a standard of\nreview which district courts regularly apply in a variety of\ncontexts, those provisions are entitled to enforcement\nunder the FAA”).\n   One unusual feature, however, prompted some of us to\nquestion whether the case should be approached another\nway. The arbitration agreement was entered into in the\ncourse of district-court litigation, was submitted to the\nDistrict Court as a request to deviate from the standard\nsequence of trial procedure, and was adopted by the Dis\n                  Cite as: 552 U.

Hence a question raised by this Court at oral\nargument: should the agreement be treated as an exercise\nof the District Court’s authority to manage its cases under\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 16? See, e.g., Tr. of Oral\nArg. 11–12. Supplemental briefing at the Court’s behest\njoined issue on the question, and it appears that Hall\nStreet suggested something along these lines in the Court\nof Appeals, which did not address the suggestion.\n   We are, however, in no position to address the question\nnow, beyond noting the claim of relevant case manage\nment authority independent of the FAA. The parties’\nsupplemental arguments on the subject in this Court\nimplicate issues of waiver and the relation of the FAA both\nto Rule 16 and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of\n1998, 28 U. S. C. §651 et seq., none of which has been\nconsidered previously in this litigation, or could be well\naddressed for the first time here. We express no opinion\non these matters beyond leaving them open for Hall Street\nto press on remand. If the Court of Appeals finds they are\nopen, the court may consider whether the District Court’s\nauthority to manage litigation independently warranted\nthat court’s order on the mode of resolving the indemnifi\ncation issues remaining in this case.\n                        *     *     *\n  Although we agree with the Ninth Circuit that the FAA\nconfines its expedited judicial review to the grounds listed\nin 9 U.

Because this result conflicts with the\nprimary purpose of the FAA and ignores the historical\ncontext in which the Act was passed, I respectfully\ndissent.\n  Prior to the passage of the FAA, American courts were\ngenerally hostile to arbitration.

MATTEL, INC.\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nagreements to arbitrate.2 Section 2 of the FAA responded\nto this hostility by making written arbitration agreements\n“valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.” 9 U. S. C. §2. This\nsection, which is the centerpiece of the FAA, reflects Con\ngress’ main goal in passing the legislation: “to abrogate\nthe general common-law rule against specific enforcement\nof arbitration agreements,” Southland Corp. v. Keating,\n465 U. S. 1, 18 (1984) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part), and to “ensur[e] that private arbitra\ntion agreements are enforced according to their terms,”\nVolt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of\nLeland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478 (1989).\nGiven this settled understanding of the core purpose of the\nFAA, the interests favoring enforceability of parties’ arbi\ntration agreements are stronger today than before the\nFAA was enacted. As such, there is more—and certainly\nnot less—reason to give effect to parties’ fairly negotiated\ndecisions to provide for judicial review of arbitration\nawards for errors of law.\n   Petitioner filed this rather complex action in an Oregon\nstate court. Based on the diverse citizenship of the par\nties, respondent removed the case to federal court. More\nthan three years later, and after some issues had been\nresolved, the parties sought and obtained the District\nCourt’s approval of their agreement to arbitrate the re\nmaining issues subject to de novo judicial review. They\nneither requested, nor suggested that the FAA authorized,\nany “expedited” disposition of their case. Because the\narbitrator made a rather glaring error of law, the judge\nrefused to affirm his award until after that error was\ncorrected. The Ninth Circuit reversed.\n\n——————\n    2 See\n        Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 264 U. S. 109, 120–122\n(1924); The Atlanten, 252 U. S. 313, 315–316 (1920). Although agree\nments to arbitrate were not specifically enforceable, courts did award\nnominal damages for the breach of such contracts.\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n  This Court now agrees with the Ninth Circuit’s (most\nrecent) interpretation of the FAA as setting forth the\nexclusive grounds for modification or vacation of an arbi\ntration award under the statute. As I read the Court’s\nopinion, it identifies two possible reasons for reaching this\nresult: (1) a supposed quid pro quo bargain between Con\ngress and litigants that conditions expedited federal en\nforcement of arbitration awards on acceptance of a statu\ntory limit on the scope of judicial review of such awards;\nand (2) an assumption that Congress intended to include\nthe words “and no other” in the grounds specified in §§10\nand 11 for the vacatur and modification of awards. Nei\nther reason is persuasive.\n  While §9 of the FAA imposes a 1-year limit on the time\nin which any party to an arbitration may apply for confir\nmation of an award, the statute does not require that the\napplication be given expedited treatment. Of course, the\npremise of the entire statute is an assumption that the\narbitration process may be more expeditious and less\ncostly than ordinary litigation, but that is a reason for\ninterpreting the statute liberally to favor the parties’ use\nof arbitration. An unnecessary refusal to enforce a per\nfectly reasonable category of arbitration agreements de\nfeats the primary purpose of the statute.\n  That purpose also provides a sufficient response to the\nCourt’s reliance on statutory text. It is true that a wooden\napplication of “the old rule of ejusdem generis,” ante, at 9,\nmight support an inference that the categories listed in\n§§10 and 11 are exclusive, but the literal text does not\ncompel that reading—a reading that is flatly inconsistent\nwith the overriding interest in effectuating the clearly\nexpressed intent of the contracting parties. A listing of\ngrounds that must always be available to contracting\nparties simply does not speak to the question whether\nthey may agree to additional grounds for judicial review.\n  Moreover, in light of the historical context and the\n4          HALL STREET ASSOCIATES, L.L.C. v. MATTEL, INC.\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nbroader purpose of the FAA, §§10 and 11 are best under\nstood as a shield meant to protect parties from hostile\ncourts, not a sword with which to cut down parties’ “valid,\nirrevocable and enforceable” agreements to arbitrate their\ndisputes subject to judicial review for errors of law.3 §2.\n   Even if I thought the narrow issue presented in this\ncase were as debatable as the conflict among the courts of\nappeals suggests, I would rely on a presumption of over\nriding importance to resolve the debate and rule in favor\nof petitioner’s position that the FAA permits the statutory\ngrounds for vacatur and modification of an award to be\nsupplemented by contract. A decision “not to regulate” the\nterms of an agreement that does not even arguably offend\nany public policy whatsoever, “is adequately justified by a\npresumption in favor of freedom.” FCC v. Beach Commu\nnications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 320 (1993) (STEVENS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).\n   Accordingly, while I agree that the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals must be set aside, and that there may be\nadditional avenues available for judicial enforcement of\nparties’ fairly negotiated review provisions, see, ante, at\n13–15, I respectfully dissent from the Court’s interpreta\ntion of the FAA, and would direct the Court of Appeals to\naffirm the judgment of the District Court enforcing the\narbitrator’s final award.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n    3 In\n      the years before the passage of the FAA, arbitration awards were\nsubject to thorough and broad judicial review. See Cohen & Dayton,\nThe New Federal Arbitration Law, 12 Va. L. Rev. 265, 270-271 (1926);\nCullinan, Contracting for an Expanded Scope of Judicial Review in\nArbitration Agreements, 51 Vand. L. Rev. 395, 409 (1998). In §§10 and\n11 of the FAA, Congress significantly limited the grounds for judicial\nvacatur or modification of such awards in order to protect arbitration\nawards from hostile and meddlesome courts.\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

Pet. for Cert. i.\nLike the majority and JUSTICE STEVENS, and primarily for\nthe reasons they set forth, I believe that the Act does not\npreclude enforcement of such an agreement. See ante, at\n13 (opinion of the Court) (The Act “is not the only way into\ncourt for parties wanting review of arbitration awards”);\nante, at 3–4 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (The Act is a “shield\nmeant to protect parties from hostile courts, not a sword\nwith which to cut down parties’ ‘valid, irrevocable and\nenforceable’ agreements to arbitrate their disputes subject\nto judicial review for errors of law”).\n  At the same time, I see no need to send the case back for\nfurther judicial decisionmaking. The agreement here was\nentered into with the consent of the parties and the ap\nproval of the District Court. Aside from the Federal Arbi\ntration Act itself, 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., respondent below\npointed to no statute, rule, or other relevant public policy\nthat the agreement might violate. The Court has now\nrejected its argument that the agreement violates the Act,\nand I would simply remand the case with instructions that\n2     HALL STREET ASSOCIATES, L.L.C. v.
